Bless you, extends my update capability for another version. ;-)
However, Ingo posted a patch for the thread "network dies after random 
time" which probably didn't make it into rc1. In all fairness applying 
that might fix the problem, it's possible if unlikely that the new 
driver tickles a bug the stable sk98lin driver didn't.
Does skge work for your hardware? Based on a sample size of one (four to 
go) everything worked for me except NFS, jumbo packets work with tcp, 
not with udp. I don't have everything nailed down enough for a proper 
bug report, it's just something to note. In truth there's little to 
choose between tcp and udp for machines in the same room, I could live 
with skge.
haven't tried shy2, there was a build failure on my last server build, 
won't look at it until Monday.
