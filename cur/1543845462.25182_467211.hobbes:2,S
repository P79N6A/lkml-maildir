Sure - we will go with that.
./linux-2.6.x/include/asm-parisc/system.h
/* interrupt control */
#define local_save_flags(x)     __asm__ __volatile__("ssm 0, %0" : "=r" (x) 
: : "memory")
#define local_irq_disable()     __asm__ __volatile__("rsm %0,%%r0\n" : : 
"i" (PSW_I) : "memory" )
#define local_irq_enable()      __asm__ __volatile__("ssm %0,%%r0\n" : : 
"i" (PSW_I) : "memory" )
