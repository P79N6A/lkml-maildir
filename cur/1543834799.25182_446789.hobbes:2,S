Well, the problem is that someone actually went through the
effort of doing the week-long reviews of your code, you flamed him
every time he suggested that there was need for improvement, instead
of saying thanks for all the hard work and implementing the needed
fixes.
Not exactly the right way to make people fond of reviewing your code.
Getting flamed by someone having a hard time taking criticism
after spending 5 minutes to review a patch is bearable, after all,
what's 5 minutes, right?  Flaming someone that has put down a week
or two of hard work on review is just disrespectful.
