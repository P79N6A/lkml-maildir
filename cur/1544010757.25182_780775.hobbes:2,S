In a scenario where the system physically cannot gather the desired data 
without influencing the behaviour of the program, I see two options:
1) limit the behaviour of the system to ensure that we can gather the 
performance monitoring data as specified
2) limit the performance monitoring to minimize any influence on the 
program, and report the fact that performance monitoring was limited.
You've indicated that you don't want option 1, so I assume that you 
prefer option 2.  In the above scenario, how would _you_ handle it?
