I am ecstatic beyond words to announce the release of procps version
2.0.13. This release contains a number of NPTL-related enhancements,
courtesy of Alexander Larsson of Red Hat. Some of the enhancements are
generic in nature, and thus also benefit non-NPTL applications.
I encourage everyone to give this a try, especially 2.5 users.
Tarball, RPM packages, and CVS information is available at:

Change Log:
        - fix top(1) -p flag behavior (Lars Holmberg)
        - do not qsort the process list if we are not sorting  
          (Alexander Larsson)
        - read tgid from /proc/pid/status if it exists
          (Alexander Larsson)
        - PROC_SKIPTHREADS flag for ps_readproc() to force only 
          reading of (tgid != pid) to avoid lots of syscalls
          (Alexander Larsson)
        - Look at PM->flags in ps_readproc() to avoid reading
          /proc files files that are not needed. (Alexander Larsson)
        - Support FILLMEM, FILLCMD, FILLENV, FILLWCHAN for above.
          (Alexander Larsson)
        - Fix wchan decoding bug (Alexander Larsson)
        - Fix for ticks going backward and cleanup (Denis Vlasenko)
And other misc. cleanups and changes.
Enjoy,
