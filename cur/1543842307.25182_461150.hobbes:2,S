Kexec doesn't break any drivers.  kexec exposes bugs in driver initialization
handling, when drivers on not robust.
The normal kexec case should be quite simple to handle and because we cleanup
just like a reboot, the difference is that we don't ask the BIOS to reset us
first.
The kexec on panic case is painful, because drivers in the original kernel are
not stopped or shutdown, and so the secondary kernel gets to initialize drivers
from an essentially random state.
