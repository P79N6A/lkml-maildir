Ick. You need to disable the repeated interrupt. Try this instead of
the die:
cli();
 __asm__ __volatile__ ("hlt");
And if it makes a huge logfile again, just mail the first bit .... I don't
care about huge emails, but others on lkml probably do ;-)
M.
PS. Nor do I care what the die says, I just want to stop the processor.
I want to know what it was doing just before the smp_error_interrupt.
There are more elegant solutions around to stop repeated APIC errors,
but this should be OK for debug.
