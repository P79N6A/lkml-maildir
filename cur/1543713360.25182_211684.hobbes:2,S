The VAX port also (still) uses a modified version of the d/c/dz.[ch]
driver. Also, the MIPS guys may have some outstanding patches...
So, please let's do two things before throwing away the old driver:
	- The MIPS guys need to be happy; they might have some
	  outstanding changes...
	- The VAX guys need to start using the new driver, I'll just
	  start and try to port over our changes.
While at it, I've already implemented some SERIO changes. That'll allow
the dz.c driver to announce that it waits for LK-style keyboard on one
port and VSXXX-style mouse/digitizer on the 2nd port...
MfG, JBG
