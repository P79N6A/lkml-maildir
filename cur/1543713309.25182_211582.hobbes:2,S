ok no problem, so page->private got screwed. I cannot see what could
change page->private though. I should also have noticed myself that
page->private was wrong: 0xc07721ff is not a 4byte aligned address, that
explains the weird page count too, since page_count follows
page->private to return the page->count of the master page.
I've no idea what could set page->private to such a weird address. the
"p" page is at address c0772380, that seems sane, the page->flags and
page->mapping as well are sane (p->count cannot be seen, what we see is
p->private->count), only page->private is screwed apparently.
if you want you can give a spin to this patch. As far as the old code
worked (i.e. with hugetlbfs=n) this should work too, since it disables
the compound feature completely, but if it works it probably only hides
the real bug. You can use rc3-aa3 for this (it already has the latest
robustness fixes I posted to you)
