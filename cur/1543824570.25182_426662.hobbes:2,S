Hey Guys,
 I am getting a -
"Kernel panic - not syncing: attempted to kill init!"
error when I try to run 2.6.16 kernel compiled with kdb support. Any
ideas how to proceded further into this problem?
Steps I took were:
1. Got a fresh 2.6.16.1 kernel
2. Applied the kdb patch from 
ftp://oss.sgi.com/www/projects/kdb/download/v4.4/
3. make clean; make; make modules_install install; reboot;
I am running this Linux RHEL inside VMWare. Now when I reboot to the
2.6.16-kgb kernel..
I get the following error after I choose the 2.6.16 kernel from grub!

I an provide the screen shot(60k), but not sure if posting screen
shots is recommended, so didn't post it.
However, when I boot up with the older kernel. everything works fine.
Any ideas whats the problem or how to proceed further?
Thanks a lot for your time,
Rohan Mutagi
