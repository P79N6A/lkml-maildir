Back when I started on Linux I was told that (void) foo()
was just extra characters and somehow made the code "hard to read"
and was thus not the "Linux way".
I think I did it because in a previous life kernel code needed to be
lint-free
to get checked in, and lint complained about return values getting
ignored.
I happen to agree with lint because I think it uncovers real bugs -- in
this case ignored error return values -- something that is rarely tested
at run-time until you need it:-)  But I have no interest in a style
debate.
I expect the custom will get changed when Linus decides that it is
useful, and not before.
