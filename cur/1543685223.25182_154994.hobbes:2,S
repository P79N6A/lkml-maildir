This is a 100mbit product, not gigabit.

The products referred to here are the HP ProCurve Switch 8000M and the
HP ProCurve Switch 1600M.  The 1600M has only one (optional) GigE port,
so it's disqualified.  The 8000M has up to 10 GigE ports, so it could be
interesting.  The PDF says "Cut-through Layer 3 switching", which is a
bit of marketese that I have trouble deciphering.  I'll run some tests
on our 4000M and see if I can come to any conclusions...  if anyone can
point to a whitepaper on the ProCurve chassis design I'd apprecate it.

I'm still curious.
