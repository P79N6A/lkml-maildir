True.  But then nobody said the idea was rejected for that reason, just
that supporting binary drivers is not a compelling reason to embrace a
stable API.  In other words, supporting binary drivers is not nearly as
important as other factors which would be harmed by a stable API.

The collective effort seems to be doing just fine without it.

No, it's not clear what you mean by scalability.  What is it exactly that
you think would be more scalable?   As has been mentioned already, there
is no better example today of scalable development than the Linux kernel. 
So, I don't think you've laid out at all what it is you're talking about.

The linux kernel development model scales very well.  Linux itself scales
from the smallest embedded processors to the largest parallel computing
farms today; all without a stable internal API.  So you've failed to make
a case that there is a problem for which a stable API is the solution.
