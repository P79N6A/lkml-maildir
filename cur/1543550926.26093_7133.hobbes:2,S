The VM/CMS operating system had a new file system around 1979 or 1980.
It had exactly the same characteristics... writing the new blocks and
then writing a final block which changed the world. The work was
derived from Chris Stephens' work on YMS (Yorktown Monitor System).
Since Chris was part of IBM Research, and since researchers got major
brownie points from patents, I bet that the there are some patents to
be found of interest.
Clearly, the same idea has been rediscovered over and over again. The
VM/CMS case would be a good example of prior art, since it had
thousands of licenses and hundreds of thousands of end users in the
early 1980s.
