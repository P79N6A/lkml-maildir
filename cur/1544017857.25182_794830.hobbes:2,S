I think this is fine. When/if we remove task_pgrp_nr() from fs/, we
can do the trivial patch which just removes this helper from sched.h.
And thanks for discussion. Somehow I forgot that the untested changes
is a pain for maintainers, and it was the bad idea to make the next
patch which depend on these changes.
