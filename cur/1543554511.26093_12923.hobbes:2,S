Subject: IDE0 /dev/hda performance hit in 2217 on my HW

I skimmed over the archives and didn't find a mention of this.  I thought
I'd noticed this when I first installed 2217, but I was too busy to verify
it at the time.
Simple case:
Under 2216, I can do a 'badblocks /dev/hda1 XXXXX'.  Vmstat shows about
10,000K/s average.  This is consistent with 'dd' operations I use to copy
partitions for disk mirroring/backup.
Under 2217, the xfer speed drops to near 1,000K/s.  This is for both
'badblocks'
and a 'dd' if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb bs=256k.  In both instances, I notice
a near 90% performance degredation.
Haven't tried any latest 2.2.18's -- has there been any work that might
have fixed this problem in 2218.  Am I the only person who noticed this?
I.e. -- maybe it's something peculiar to my HW (Inspiron 7500),
IBM DARA-22.5G HD.
