Hmm.

There should be a message like "ieee1394: Host added: ID:BUS[0-00:1023]
 GUID..." shortly later. It's logged at kern.debug level though.

OK.

I don't get what this is about. Who denies what?

There should be something like "ieee1394: Node added: ID:BUS[0-00:1023]
 GUID..." and that the host changed from 0-00 to 1-00 at kern.debug level.

I don't remember what was changed at that time. Maybe that was the
addition of the new isochronous interface that I mentioned. The old one
was (is?) still there but maybe there were interactions... However this
is not related to the inability to issue AV/C commands, which are issued
asynchronously. I think though that your kino 0.8.x package is
configured to work isochronously via video1394(?) but asynchronously via
raw1394, and the kino 0.9.x package to do both via raw1394. But don't
take my word on it, I keep mistaking one interface for another. I never
used video cameras on FireWire myself.

Anything under /sys/bus/ieee1394/devices?
It might be not too difficult to compile 1394commander since it doesn't
have many library dependencies; just libraw1394 (probably as -devel
package) and optionally readline. Gscanbus would show a bit more about
attached devices without resorting to magic commands but it is a bit
harder to compile, as a GUI program.
