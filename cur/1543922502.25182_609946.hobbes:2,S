That may still fail if a netif creation, and a rename compete about the
same name, right?
The driver core name of the netdev is part of the netdev, so the net
core might need to rename the driver core part while holding its usual
lock, just like it does when it changes the net internal name?
The netdev rename should also fail, if the core rename fails, right?
Thanks,
Kay
