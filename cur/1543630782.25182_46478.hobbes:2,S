With 2.5.15 I'm able to boot again. Great. Starting with 2.5.9 (upto
2.5.14) I was getting
  hda: lost interrupt
and the system was stuck at that point.
But now I'm happy again.
But for my KT266 I need a little patch. I've copied the entry for 82C561
which may be somewhat incorrrect. But it's a start.
