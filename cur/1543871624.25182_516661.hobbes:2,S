No way on either one.  f_path.dentry always beeing there is an assumption
we make all over the place, and changing that would be a big regression
for code qualityand reliability all over the place.
Face it folks, memory is generally cheap, and we're not going to uglify
huge amounts of code to shave of a little bit.
[and that is only in reply to this one, the single dentry optimizations
 for epoll and friends are perfecltly fine from the high level view]

Same thing as above.  We might do a hack to not refcount these vfsmounts,
but we definitively want to keep the invariant of f_path.mnt never
beeing NULL.
