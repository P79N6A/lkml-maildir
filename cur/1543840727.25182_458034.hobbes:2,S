Yep.  And the "m" args in the pda asm isn't quite right for rmw PDA ops 
(not that there are any at the moment).

OK.  I thought the assembler objected to me about it.

The sigcontext contains the userspace register state at the time of the 
signal.  Since userspace %gs is stored in the on-stack pt_regs, that 
should be where it fetches it from to fill out the sigcontext, rather 
than the kernel's internal value of %gs - in other words, it should be 
the same as ds and es.  Or am I missing something?

Yep.  But there seems to be some other very dubious code in there as 
well (the asm("mov %%eax,%0" : "=r" (eax)) sequence).  I was wondering 
about what it all does...
