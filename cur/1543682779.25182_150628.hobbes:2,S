  Well there are 2 issues here:
1) How to handle "make oldconfig" on 2.4 config files.  Which may not be 
fixable in a manner that doesn't involve really ugly code.
2) That make menuconfig|xconfig on a clean 2.6 tree results in a kernel 
that doesn't have console support.   This will be something that will 
come up over and over again in the future, and does not require ugly 
hacks to fix.
