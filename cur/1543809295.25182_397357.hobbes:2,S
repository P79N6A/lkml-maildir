This bit is already used to mean that msi is disabled for a specific device,
which appears to be a PCI Express to PCI bridge (PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_PXH).  So
it seems that disabling MSI for child devices as well might break things (i.e.
disable msi unnecessarily).
Working for Intel, I guess you would know about the PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_PXH
best: what do you say?
In my opinion, it is cleaner to separate the two concepts: suppress msi
for child devices versus suppress it for the specific device.
Right?
