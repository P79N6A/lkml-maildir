Subject: [PATCH] anti-cross-CPU printk/oops interleaving
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus,
This patch prevents an oops on one CPU being interleaved char-by-char with
printks being performed on other CPUs, thus rendering them actually readable
under those circumstances.
David
