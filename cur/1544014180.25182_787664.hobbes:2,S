OK, I've tested this and applied it for 2.6.29.
Though it only actually fixes the regression if your other patch ("CRED:
Fix regression in cap_capable() as shown up by sys_faccessat() [ver #2")
is also applied.  I'd like to send in my pull request today, but I
usually try not to send a pull request whose tip doesn't pass at least
my basic regression tests....  And that other patch is outside my
baliwick.    Can someone else handle it?
