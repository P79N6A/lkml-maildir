This one seems worse. Passing your vm_area_cache around everywhere, which
is just intrusive and dangerous because ot becomes decoupled from the mm
struct you are passing around. Watch this:

So now you can have current calling find_extend_vma on someone else's mm
but using their cache. So you're going to return current's vma, or current
is going to get one of mm's vmas in its cache :P
