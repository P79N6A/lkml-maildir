For architectures with a split address space there has to be a call
set_fs(USER_DS) that switches from KERNEL_DS to USER_DS for the init
process. So far this has been done in search_binary_handler and
traditionally the kernel starts with KERNEL_DS to make the early
copy_from_user calls work.
So, what is wrong with always setting USER_DS? We are starting a user
space process after all.
