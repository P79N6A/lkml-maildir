From the little bit of the discussion that I saw a few weeks ago the idea of 
file patterns in the MAINTAINERS file didn't go over very well.  I still 
don't see the "F" field specified/described at the top of the file.
As long as it is not a problem to have two maintainer entries, I think James' 
patch (what it currently in-tree) is pretty good right now - it fits with the 
rest of the NETWORKING [*] entries and looks correct to me.

Sure.  HP is my current employer, i.e. they pay me, and both myself and HP 
have pledged to continue supporting NetLabel (see the patchset posting that 
was first accepted into the 2.6.19); I imagine this would fall under 
the "Supported" category as currently stated.  A few days ago I was asked, 
and agreed to, maintain all of the labeled networking code (in addition to 
NetLabel).  While it is extremely likely that HP will support this decision 
and allow me to work on all of the labeled networking infrastructure at work, 
it would be overstepping my role within the company to say that HP is 
pledging support for all of labeled networking.
I think the important thing here is that "someone is looking after this", 
whether or not they are actually paid to do so is not quite as important in 
my mind.  If you feel strongly about the distinction please let me know and I 
will update the status when/if it changes.
