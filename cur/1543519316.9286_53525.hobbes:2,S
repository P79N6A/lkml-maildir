But keep in mind that mmap SHARED+WRITE does not give you everything
(In fact it does not give you much at all, since you cannot unmap und
mmap the same region during a run).
I am just now working on shm code using struct files for shmat. This
would make shmat a special case of mmap. Also shm_open would be
trivial (and is in fact what I am heading for). shm_open gives you a
file descriptor to a shared memory object which you then can mmap.
My code is progressing now. I have most of the dentry/inode handling
ready and have now to debug the mmap case.
