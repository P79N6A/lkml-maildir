this is precisely the point i was making. either you agree that
unprivileged users can get easy access to a scheduling class that can
reliably DOS the system, or they can't. if they can't, what kind of
scheduling class can they access easily?
according to andrew, and i agree with his conclusion, many people
agree that its OK for them to get access to the DOS class, but there's
little agreement on the security model to allow this. Con is
suggesting that they are not, but instead get a different scheduling
class that is functionally equivalent except that it can't
(theoretically) be used to DOS the system.
