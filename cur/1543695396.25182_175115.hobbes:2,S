Uh. I may have misunderstood, but I understood that using this option would 
activate the controller's hardware RAID feature, which I don't want.
I need to use the controller as a normal, non-RAID, IDE controller (and if 
ever if was setup as hardware RAID, I'm afraid it would destroy my data..)
Cheers.
