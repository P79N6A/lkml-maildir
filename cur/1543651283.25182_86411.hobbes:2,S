Because it's harder for you to do a proper job, doesn't mean it is for
everybody else.

Capabilities are not about adding features, they are about reducing.
Face it, you just don't get it.

Agreed in _every_ _single_ _point_. But because there might be stupid
vendors out there, doesn't mean I have to bow down to their level.

So, what's your point? Like with suid root, capability settings need
to be debugged, bug reports filed and people educated.

Well, _that_ is bullshit.
