Thanks for adding that comment, I completely misread this when you
first showed it to me, and didn't get the point at all.  (But you're
a little too fond of "/* Multiline" comments: in this case, with no
blank line above, it'd look better with a "/*" lone line to separate
from the pte_modify code.)
Yes, I guess that is worth doing, though it's a bit sad and ugly:
goes right against the simplicity of working with vm_page_prot.
Could you change "is_accountable" to "dirty_accountable" throughout?
We've various different kinds of accounting going on hereabouts,
I think it'd be more understandable as "dirty_accountable".
