Why bother with that complexity? Just use 128 byte lines. This allows
a decent generic kernel. The people who have space requirements would
only compile what they need anyway.

While I like Adrian's patch a lot from a functionality and user
simplicity point of view, the key to getting it merged is not to 
increase the complexity of the implementation. The only objections to
the concept came from people who didn't understand it AFAIK.
And too many combinations of ill defined things like this will make 
people (developers) go nuts.
