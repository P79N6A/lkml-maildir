That's reasonable -- that probably means you don't want to be crippled
as an administer.

Er.. what's misguided. Or are you responding to something I didn't

No, this approach does have some merit.
However, remember that ultimate security requires ultimate simplicity.
The point of caps is to >>limit<< the scope of required auditing.
And, there are some applications where caps achieve this end. These
applications, by nature, must be very rigidly defined and narrow in
scope.
I wouldn't want to go so far as to say that there will never be a linux
distribution that uses fine grained privilege masks in the file system.
However: I think I'm safe to say that if such a system (or distribution)
is done right it's not going to be what we currently think of as a
general purpose system (/distribution).

Sure, linuxconf is aiming to address a very general (almost open ended)
problem.  By definition, if you want crippled administrators you can't
be having them address general case problems.
