Hmm. That does sound like unsycned TSCs. Normally Intel systems don't
skew unless they are NUMA systems or you're entering low power states.
We try to catch both of those cases, so I'm not sure how you box is
slipping through.
Can you run the following test to verify that the TSCs are skewed?
thanks
