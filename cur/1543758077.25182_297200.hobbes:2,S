I know what you mean... but this is not _just_ for STREAM. Firstly,
if we start 4 tasks on one core (of a 4 socket / 8 core system), and
just let them be moved around by the periodic balancer, they will
tend to cluster on 2 or 3 CPUs, and that will be the steady state.

True, for OpenMP apps (and this work shouldn't stop that from happening).
But other threaded apps are also important, and fork()ed apps can be
important too.
What I hear from the NUMA guys (POWER5, AMD) is that they really want to
keep memory controllers busy. This seems to be the best way to do it.
There are a few differences between this and when we last tried it. The
main thing is that the balancer is now sched-domains aware. I hope we
can get it to do the right thing more often (at least it is a per domain
flag, so those who don't want it don't turn it on).

Thanks for reviewing.
