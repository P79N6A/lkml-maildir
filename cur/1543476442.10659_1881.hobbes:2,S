What?  Creative doesn't release specs for their hardware?  I'm
doing a very large purchase order right now and had planned on
going with Creative products.  If it is true that their
programming specs are closed, and that they are shutting out
other OS's like Linux, then I'll be purchasing hardware from
competitors that do release specs and support open-source
systems.
Can someone confirm/deny this?  If it is true, I won't be
recommending any creative hardware to any of my customers any
more, and I recommend everyone else do the same.
I've had it with vendors that create hardware, and don't release
specs, and expect that either everyone uses Windows, or should
use Windows.  A piece of hardware is inherently not tied to ANY
OS, but by not releasing specs, and not creating drivers for all
OS's, they sure do make their hardware OS specific.
When you look at the growth of the Linux OS in the last year or
so, and look at the projected growth for this year, and on... it
is a miracle that companies like Creative don't wake up and smell
the coffee.  It is them that will lose out as Linux pushes its
way past Microsoft.
Can anyone recommend a good replacement for the AWE64 series of
cards?  Non-Creative labs that is?  Something with proper
full-duplex, and wavetable, etc...
I'd like to have something that my customers can rely on in *ANY*
OS.
Thanks in advance.
