I missed the beginning of this discussion,
but here's a data point:
The QStor SATA/RAID controller hardware fully supports hotplug
(and NCQ, TCQ, Host-Queuing, RAID 0/1/10, PM, etc..).
It uses a single interrupt for all onboard events from the four channels.
An internal "status FIFO" provides a readout for the interrupt handler
of recent happenings, in sequence, mixing together DMA-completions
with hotplug-events (insert, removal) and various fault-conditions.
All of this is supported in the out-of-tree qstor driver,
but only simple single-IO is supported by sata_qstor at present.
Dunno if that info is of any use to you in hotplug considerations.
Once the libata infrastructure for hotplug is in place,
I *may* experiment with adding that functionality to sata_qstor.
Cheers
