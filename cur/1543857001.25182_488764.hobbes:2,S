But you do in sata_sil.c:sil_freeze().

libata doesn't specify in its documentation that these driver
operations may have delayed behaviour, so I have to assume that
side-effects are to be completed when the operations return.
In fact, the documentation for __ata_port_freeze explicitly
requires the port to not perform any operations until thawed.
If I didn't flush, the port could do just that.
Since the flushes clearly are safe I'd prefer to keep them, but
of course I'll remove them if you or Jeff can guarantee that not
flushing the PCI writes is OK.
