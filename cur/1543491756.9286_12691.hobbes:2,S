Subject: Finding out which syscall you are in

Is there any way of finding out the number of a syscall from within that
syscall?
For example, would it be possible (although somewhat silly) to have the
same function pointed to by two different entries in sys_call_table, and
that function behaving differently depending which entry it was called as?
(I don't think that makes sense, but hopefully somebody will understand
what I mean)
