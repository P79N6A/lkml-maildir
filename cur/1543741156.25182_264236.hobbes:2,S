Nope.  The PC BIOS looks for "expansion ROMs", and calls initialization 
routines in the ones it finds.  It then expects to be able to call INT 
10 to position the cursor and print text (and read the cursor position, 
what's on screen, etc.).  You could have a BIOS on a network card that 
provides the necessary interrupt routines, but actually talks to a 
remote X server for display functions.  (yes - it might need to 
advertise itself as a video device for this to work)

Right - all video cards provide these BIOS routines (including one the 
one being considered here).  They aren't in the system BIOS.  (Not that 
there are no broken BIOSes around, but strictly speaking, there is no 
need at all for the system BIOS to know anything about the display card 
being used)
