If msgsnd() acquires the pointer first, it does it under lock + 
rcu_getref(). ==> refcount = 2
When schedule() is called if freeque() takes the pointer it will call 
msg_rmid() that sets the deleted field in the msg queue. When the lock 
is released by freeque(), we have either 1) or 2):
1) freeque()'s putref called 1st ==> refocunt = 1
    Then msgsnd()'s lock_by_ptr() is called ==> rcu lock
    Then msgsnd()'s putref is called ==> refcount = 0
    But this is done under RCU lock, so should be no problem
    Then the deleted field is checked ==> return
2) msgsnd()'s lock_by_ptr() is called ==> rcu lock
    Then we don't mind in which order are done the other operations
    since we under rcu_lock: the structure won't disappear till we test
    the deleted field.
