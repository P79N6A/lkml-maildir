In 2.4.19-rc3-ac2, Alan Cox / James Mayer added a modeline entry to 
modedb.c that enables a 1280x600 console screen on Vaio C1M* devices. 
The patch works fine for me in 2.4.19.
In 2.4.20-pre* kernels, it does no longer work for me, the console 
remains at the default setting.
I identified the hunk below to be the culprit. That check was removed in 
2.4.20-* kernels. When I revert the hunk below, adding back the null 
check, my system again switches to full screen console mode.
I propose to revert the hunk for 2.4.20.
Tested with 2.4.20-rc1.
Thanks,
Kai
