Speaking of RIP, I am having some missing broadcasts with 2.2.3 (these are
production machines so it is difficult to change kernels on them) 
system 1
p-100 32MB ram IDE drive
3x Tulip cards, 1 local net, 1 crosover to system 2, 1 to routers
Slackware 3.5 with updates for 2.2 kernel
system 2
p-233 64MB ram SCSI drive
3x Tulip cards, 1 2nd local net, 1 crosover to system 1, 1 empty (will be
to 2nd set of routers)
Redhat 5.2 with patches for 2.2 kernel
When I do a tcpdump on the crosover link I see RIP broadcasts going in
both directions from both machines, however I do not see the local net
addresses being broadcast from either side and the routing tables reflect
this. The routers connected to system 1 do see the system 1 local net
addresses so they are being broadcast sometime, but not all the time.
Any suggestions/pointers
