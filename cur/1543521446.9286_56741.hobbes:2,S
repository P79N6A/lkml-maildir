thanks for the program (I didn't know about that ioctl before)!
I've tried speed 0 and several other values, it doesn't seem to make
any difference.
in the mean time I got some 3 more DVD (video) disks, and those discs
I can read with higher transfer rates!
the two DVD9 discs (two layers, signle side) read up to 5.4 MB/sec (4x)
while the DVD5 disc (sigle layer, single side) went up to 6.85 MB/sec (5x).
if there are some (rather small) finger prints on the bottom side of 
the discs (esp. for DVD9 disks) then the transfer rates dropped 
to 2x or even 1x and sometimes I just got read errors!
so it looks like it's mostly a problem with the media itself and my
first disc to test (SuSE 6.3 on DVD) might be the real source, 
or maybe it's a difference between video discs and data discs ?!

"drive speed" is always reported being 0 (zero).  but looking at the
code in scsi/sr.c get_capabilities() only gets called once at boot time
from sr_finish(), so it's no big surprise that the value 
in /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info doesn't change...
