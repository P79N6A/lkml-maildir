Hello World
With the 2.6.19 kernels I've tried (2.6.19-rc1-git7 and 
2.6.19-rc4-git10), enabling the Intel Microcode Update Driver causes the 
kernel to hang for more than ten seconds when I boot. The last thing it 
shows on the screen is `TCP reno registered' and then it just stops like 
its a kernel panic. But it isn't, after about ten seconds the text flies 
up the screen again and the system boots normally. Disabling support for 
the microcode update makes the problem go away.
