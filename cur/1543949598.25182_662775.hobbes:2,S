Correct. If the mmu_gather were passed on the mmuops callout and the callout were
done at the same point as the tlb_finish_mmu(), the GRU could
efficiently work w/o the range invalidates. A range invalidate might still
be slightly more efficient but not measureable so. The net difference is
not worth the extra complexity of range callouts.

I'm still concerned about performance. Each dropin would first have to access
an additional data structure that would most likely be non-node-local and
non-cache-resident. The net effect would be measurable but not a killer.
I haven't thought about locking requirements for the radix tree. Most accesses
would be read-only & updates infrequent. Any chance of an RCU-based radix
implementation?  Otherwise, don't we add the potential for hot locks/cachelines
for threaded applications ???
