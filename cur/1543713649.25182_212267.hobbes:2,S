Hi,
I am using 2.6.5-mc1 (on powerpc) and everything seems fine. I was very
happy to see that the laptop mode patch was on its way to being merge.
The only issue I have is that the proc entry for the laptop mode seems
to have changed from /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode to
/proc/sys/fs/laptop_mode and the script included in the doc is not aware
of this change.
Thanks,
Christophe
