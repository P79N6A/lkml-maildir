I think to some extent that's part of the problem. Consider for a moment 
that a /dev/hibernate would be required, and that it must be (a) a disk, 
or (b) a partition, or (c) other devices in the future, like an nbd, USB 
flash or DVD.
Don't have a device like that, then can't hibernate. Stop trying to be 
smart and use swap for two different things. Stop trying to have an 
interface between user space and kernel which does things not required 
to preserve the system. A progress indicator is not needed, power off is 
my progress indicator, and should be the sole valid end of a hibernate.

Hibernate is useful to avoid complex boot, it's useful as the UPS gets 
tired, and putting features in the process beyond saving the snap 
(possibly compressed and/or encrypted) just adds complexity. Put it all 
in the kernel and use /sys/power/state as the user interface. Stop 
oversolving the problem.
No, that doesn't avoid other hard issues, but for the most part suspend2 
has addressed them.
