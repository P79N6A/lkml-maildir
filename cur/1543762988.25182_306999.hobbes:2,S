Sorry, but an /interfase/ is there to do exactly that. It can be placed
under copyright protection as code, but /using/ it just can't be considered
a derived work. It makes no sense that if I get a description (docu,
example code, whatever) and learn from that how it is used, and then go and
write my own, that my code it should be a derived work of what is at the
other side of the interfase. 
If this was true, Linux would be a ripoff from Unix (same system calls),
and any program ever written for Unix would belong to Novell (or SCOXE, or
UCB, depending on whom you believe in the current mess). Note that this is
quite similar to the gargabe SCOXE tried claiming against Linux/IBM, and
had to take back.
