Strange - without the _enqueue patch from Peter, stutter is reduced to
an almost acceptable level for me if I just disable GROUP_SCHED.
With Peter's patch - I have tested multiple times and the stutter is
completely eliminated. So +1 for Peter's patch.
Mike recalls a regression that may be related - so it is possible you
were running w/o the affecting change.
Anyway - all is well in sched-land for now. Rejoice!
