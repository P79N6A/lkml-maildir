What do you suggest to use instead of efi_enabled?
Current method is (efi_enabled based):
(1) Encapsulate EFI based implementation and legacy BIOS based
implementation into separate functions.
(2) Define a wrapper function for each interface in (1), efi_enabled is
used to choose implementation between EFI and legacy BIOS.
Another possible method is (function pointer based):
1. Encapsulate EFI based implementation and legacy BIOS based
implementation into separate functions.
2. Define a function pointer for each interface in (1), the function
pointer is set to legacy BIOS based implementation by default and
changed to EFI based implementation if appropriate.
Because there are only two possible choice, I think the function pointer
based method has no big advantages over the efi_enabled based method.
