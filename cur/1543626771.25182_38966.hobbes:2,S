Hi Andre,
	Consider this as one more positive feedback, though slightly
unorthodox. The graphics corruption problem on my KM133 chipset
(revision 81) is gone, thanks to ur solution.
Since I had problems compiling the 2.4.18 kernel, I took the easy way out.

The byte at location 0x55 has the hex value 08 which means bit 5 is 0.
Bit 5 will be 1 if the value is hex 08 | 20 = 28.
% setpci -v -s 00:00.0 55.b=28
00:00.0:55 08
The setpci command does the job.
In fact, now I can turn this bit on and off whenever I want to and see the
graphics corruption appearing/disappearing within seconds. I suggest that
folks try this out _first_ before going thru the process of compiling,
installing and running a patched kernel. This way any special cases for
the various target chipsets will be identified beforehand. Also, this is
convenient and the only way out when kernel compilation fails.
thanks
