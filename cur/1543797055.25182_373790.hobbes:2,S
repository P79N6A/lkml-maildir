But it is equal pressure for all pools involved in being scaned the
simplifying assumption is that slab is equally distributed among
nodes. And yeah, scanning would load up when more than 1 kswapd is
running.
I had patches to do per-zone inode and dentry slab shrinking ages
ago, but nobody was interested... so I'm guessing it is a feature :)
