True...hence an argument how OpenSource software is better.  ;)  Not that
I need to argue that here, and not all OS is better than closed, but it is
easier to get what you want.
Perhaps someone with the knowledge (certainly not I) could write a GPL'd
unarchiver (with GUI, since Windows folks like those) that can handle .gz,
.bz2, .zip, .lzo, etc. files?
