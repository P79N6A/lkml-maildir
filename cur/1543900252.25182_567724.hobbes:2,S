Hi Andi,
Here are a few more Calgary updates that are appropriate for
2.6.23. The only notable one is the second one, which tightens up the
bitmap locking to only lock where absolutely necessary, giving us a
nice 10-15% improvement in CPU utilization running netperf on a large
SMP machine. Please apply.
Thanks,
Muli
