 You are probably not bound by the bandwidth between memory and the
"chipset", but the bandwidth on the FSB (or between FSB and Chipset).
This would explain why the Serverworks LE doesn't give you better
scaling than the other P3 systems.
 The P4 has a much higher FSB speed (400 MHz vs. 100/133 MHz). As a
result it has more headroom for scaling. You could look ath the Streams
results for an indicator.
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/
 The P4s definitely show the best numbers in the "PC" category, a LOT
better than any P3 result, which seem to max out at about 450 MB/sec.
Unfortunatelly no dual entries.
Dell_8100-1500                     1   2106.0   2106.0   2144.0   2144.0
Intel_STL2-PIII-933                1    423.0    419.0    517.0    517.0
Intel_440BX-2_PIII-650             1    455.0    421.0    501.0    500.0
 It would be interesting to see your test performed on a dual Athlon
(comparable speed to the P4). There seems to be evidence that they scale
better for scientific stuff, although the streams results do not show a
very good scaling.
AMD_Athlon_1200                    2    922.0    916.4   1051.7   1053.4
AMD_Athlon_1200                    1    726.8    711.8    860.1    851.4

 (as a reference for
better Athlon scaling).
