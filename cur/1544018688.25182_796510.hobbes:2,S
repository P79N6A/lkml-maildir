Great. We should fix calculate_order() to be order 3 for kmalloc-8192.
Are you interested in doing that?

That's probably because max order is capped to 3. You can change that
by passing slub_max_order=<n> as kernel parameter.

One thing is sure, SLUB seems to be hard to tune. Probably because
it's dependent on the page order so much.
