If you are a box with multiple supported binary types how big is an
"int". We use explicit sizes to ensure that uio_read() will work when/if
we get platforms which support binaries with differing ideas of the size
of "int". Thus it should use s32 or s64 or similar.

The latter is the size of a kernel "int".
Other patch looks fine.
