Hi friends...
  I've compiled recently kde 3.2.1. and works fine... but How do I start my 
"log in" with KDM? because only XDM runs.  I've modified my /etc/inittab 
with:
	x:5:respawn:/usr/local/kde/bin/kdm -nodaemon
  And run KDM, but when try to shutdown using the graphical menu, it did not 
work... I have to use "poweroff" or "shutdown -h".
thanks
