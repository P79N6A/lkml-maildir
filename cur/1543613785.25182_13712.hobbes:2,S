It's actually not worth it; these "older ARMs" I believe we can safely
drop from our sights - it has been my intention throughout 2.4 to drop
them out when 2.5 came around.  The problem is that there are people
who do want still use antequated machines, but they can look after
the problems that entails themselves IMHO. 8)
So, as far as 2.5 is concerned, consider all ARMs capable of handling
mis-aligned accesses via a fault handler.
