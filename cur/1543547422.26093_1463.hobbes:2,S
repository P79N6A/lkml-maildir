There arent copies all over the case for the paths that occur. Like 99.999%
of the time. Fragmented packets dont happen except for NFS (which is a rather
broken protocol anyway).
One DMA, one copy to user space

timers are constructed to be close to O(1), the tcp hash isnt a linear lookup,
the socket operations from user space use file-> dereferences not a lookup

We dont copy for checksumming. We fold the single user space copy and the
checksum operation into one path, because on any modern CPU it costs precisely
the same to copy as to copy/checksum. 
I don't think you've actually sat and instrumented the TCP code
