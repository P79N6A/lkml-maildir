Will that cause people to compile test both? I have my doubts that 
will really work.
e.g. a similar example would be CONFIG_MMU=n. The code 
is mostly shared and in the same directories, but people still
break the MMUless architectures all the time. 
I don't expect this to be different with 32bit/64bit.
