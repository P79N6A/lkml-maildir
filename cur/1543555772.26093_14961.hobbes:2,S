<changelog>
bttv-0.7.49
-----------
 * changed more structs to name-based initialization (from test11 patch)
 * Added kernel args for the most important bttv insmod options, based
   on Werner Almesberger's patch.
 * Added insmod option to set the tuner type to bttv (yes, that's a bit
   redundant with the tuner module's option, but this way it works with
   two cards having different tuners too).
 * more fixes for card descriptions.
 * updated the triton1 compatibility code:  moved into bttv-cards.c,
   created a new function for it, reworked and commented the code.
   Added a list for chipsets, seems the triton1 isn't the only chipset
   which needs this.  Added the via apollo to the list.
</changelog>
If someone else has a board which needs the triton1=1 insmod option to
work stable with bttv just drop me a note (don't forget to include the
PCI ID for the Host bridge), I'll add it to the new blacklist then.
