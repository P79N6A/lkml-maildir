Ok, I can see where you're getting at. When CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n,
the compiler will just optimize away the reference to (void)(nb);
and with it, the reference to the callback function too, entirely.
[ BTW I wonder if we should make the HOTPLUG_CPU=y implementation of
  register_cpu_notifier as void-returning (notifier_chain_register()
  never fails anyway) to preserve symmetry with the HOTPLUG_CPU=n stub.
  Because of the do {} while, no callsite out there can ever check the
  return from register_hotcpu_notifier() without breaking builds when
  HOTPLUG_CPU=n. But that goes against the taste of register_foo()
  functions in the kernel. So probably it is the HOTPLUG_CPU=n stub
  that should be made "static inline int {return 0;}" instead? However,
  on doing that, the compiler may fail to optimize away the callback
  function, at least that's what the testcase I wrote to experiment
  with all this proved:
			
http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/ssatyam/xyz.c
 ]
  Curiously, notifier_chain_unregister() _can_ return errors, but I bet
  *none* of the unregister_foo_notifer()'s out there ever check its
  return anyway. All the unregister_foo() and exit_foo() functions in the
  kernel tend to be void-returning for good reason, so I wonder if we
  should make notifier_chain_unregister() void-returning as well, and go
  BUG() there (instead of returning -ENOENT which noone checks) when asked
  to unregister a notifier block that didn't even exist. That does sound
  BUG-worthy to me, and in all probability, we would've oopsed when trying
  to call out the callback of said non-existent notifier_block already.
  In fact, making notifier_chain_unregister() go BUG() on that error will
  even catch certain bugs (such as somebody annotating the notifier_block
  incorrectly with __init when he should not have) early, irrespective of
  whether or not that notifier was actually ever even called out on! ]

I must say, this is an amazingly cunning idea. Only things I can think of
against this would be: the dropping of unneeded code is not guaranteed,
but depends on compiler. And we saw from the "static inline {return 0;}"
testcase that gcc can sometimes be not-so-smart.

Didn't quite get this, but yes, __cpu{init,exit} can only become __init
or __exit at most, neither of which can be dropped from a module.

I also like the above idea because it eliminates the need for authors
to have to mark their functions appropriately -- nobody gets that right
anyway, as we see from the zillions of section mismatch warnings every
-rc cycle. But the __cpuinit and __cpuinitdata consistency argument does
sound "safe". Sigh.
