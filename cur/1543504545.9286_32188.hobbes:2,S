I still don't think we need CLONE_PPIDOK.  I've been convinced that we
need PF_PPIDOK, and that flag should be cleared on exec(); but I really
don't see the process needs to explicitly allow other portions of itself
to become its siblings.
(hmm.. might it be useful to allow a process to be able to CLONE_PPID
after it has exec()ed?  That's the only time I can think of when PPIDOK
makes sense.  And that seems a pretty unlikely thing to want.)
