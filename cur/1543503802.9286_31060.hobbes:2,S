I didn't fix the scaling before running the first HZ=1024 test.
After fixing the problem the numbers are:
 100: 8.65user 0.00system 0:08.65elapsed 100%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
1024: 8.66user 0.01system 0:08.72elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
So the HZ change from 100 to 1024 means only a ~0.8% slowdown for the
raytracer - looks much better now. All stability problems have magically
disappeared after upgrading to 2.3.12pre1 ;)
