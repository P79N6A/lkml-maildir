I just wanted to check if anyone has tried 2.5.[23] on Alpha yet.  It 
appears Ingo's scheduler changes haven't been ported to work on the 
Alpha platform as yet.  I went through the pain yesterday of updating 
most of the 2.5.2 code and it now compiles, but the system crashes right 
at the beginning of init_idle(). I can send the patches I have so far, 
but seeing as it doesn't even come close to booting, I'm not sure I got 
this much right. ;)  Anyone?
