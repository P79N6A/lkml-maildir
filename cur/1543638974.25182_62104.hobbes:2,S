If you are using 2.4.19 then the actual bug dump hits is sorted. Dumping
a live fs still will mean you end up restoring a not 100% consistent
state of one file versus another and of file data for a given file. You
have to weigh that against downtime. In most cases the downtime isnt
worth it for having a few files that are logged in a transient state.
