Subject: 533057 [kernel.org] md5 for verifying downloads of kernel [right post]

Is it possible to put in webpage and in ftp a link and a file, respectively, 
of the md5 sums (or any other checking file program) of all kernel files?. 
With this, anyone could see if the downloaded kernel file (usually more than 
30MB) is well-downloaded.
Thanks,
Xan.
PS: I believe that one good place to put link were after cset link. That is, 
the lines of kernel.org were as:
