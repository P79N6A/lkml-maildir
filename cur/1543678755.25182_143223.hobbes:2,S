I put up a new release that used MD5 based names for revision numbers rather
than the revision numbers (sort of like naming a file by inode number) 
because the revision numbers shift around on you.  It has bugs.  Once we
work out the bugs the plus is that you'll be able to post a URL and it 
will always get people to the same data which is not true today.
