I respectfully disagree,
rsync works fine for now, but people are already looking at implementing
smarter (more efficient) ways to synchronize git repositories by
grabbing missing commits, and from there fetching any missing tree and
file blobs. However there is no such linkage to discover missing tag
objects, only a full rsync would be able to get them and for that it has
to send the name of every object in the repository to the other side to
check for any missing ones.
So fetching tags is already going to be a special case.
And any form of validation of a tag is a special operation. In fact tags
could be as simple as a the sha of an (like pasky's tags) followed by
the detached pgp signature of the tagged object instead of trying to
signing the tag itself. That also avoids having to strip the signature
part from the tag when we want to validate it.
