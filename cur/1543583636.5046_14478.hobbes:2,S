Well, "has to do" and "does" are two different animals.  My reading of
the code shows that it does not.  I have a bit of code that does
gettimeofday() calls as fast as possible and on some boxes (ix86) have
seen the difference as low as 1 micro second.  It is not beyond
imagination that a box might return the same time two times in a row
given the processors performance increases we are seeing.  I, for one,
don't find this objectionable.  I WILL take exception to time running
backward, however.  (I don't see how this is avoided on the leap second
delete, but I have just started looking at this issue.)  As to returning
a time in the future as you suggest, I think this is a bad policy.  If
the box can actually do two gettimeofdays in one micro second or less,
it SHOULD return the same time (given the resolution can not resolve the
difference).  If this becomes an issue, and it will, those that care
should use the clock_gettime() call which should return time in nano
seconds.  This is part of the POSIX standard code for which we are
working on at:
