The controllers affected by your patch have been around for well over a 
year.  I doubt a huge amount of suffering will be caused by pausing to 
get it right...  especially when you have been pointed at two working 
code examples that already get it right.

In Linux, we work /with/ the subsystem, not around it.
Your current approach is fundamentally flawed.  You can see this because 
e.g. a call to vt6421_ops::scr_read() will immediately oops, after your 
patch.
Just separate PATA and SATA operations.  That way everything works as 
expected, and you don't unintentionally add lovely oopses all over the 
place.
