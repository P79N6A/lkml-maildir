it does check.  the patch replaces the code like
	if (! pci_dma_support(pci, XXXX))
		error;
	pci_set_dma_mask(pci, XXXX);
with
	if (pci_dma_set_mask(pci, XXXX))
		error;
(there is one place which doesn't check, but it's in the resume
 callback.)
the problem is that in the former version only
pci_set_consistent_dma_mask() was called without pci_dma_set_mask().
apparently, this doesn't work properly.
ciao,
Takashi
