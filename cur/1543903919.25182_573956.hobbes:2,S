I have sanitized .tgz files that I use to stuff a Git repo with.  I 
recall that some of them were reconstructed through patching an earlier 
or later kernel version because the original ones were corrupted. Some 
patches were retrieved from other archival sites, etc.  Then the result 
was 
cross checked with summary lists like this one: 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0110.1/1684.html
This was a while ago so I don't remember the exact steps, but that 
wasn't always trivial.
