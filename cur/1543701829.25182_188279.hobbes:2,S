Honestly I do not like playing with SIGCLD/waitpid for things that do not 
concern real task exits. But I think it can be avoided, and actually I 
don't know why I did not think about this before. We don't need to return 
a struct task_struct* for kthread_create(). We can have:
struct kthread_struct {
	struct task_struct *tsk;
	int ret;
	struct semaphore ack; /* Or completion if you like */
};
This structure is allocated in kthread_create() and propagated to the 
kthread() void* data. Then they (the creator and the kthread) will have a 
common ground to exchange acks w/out playing with SIGCLD/waitpid. Heh ?
