You can delete a directory entry to a file if you have proper
permission to the directory.
You cannot read or write the file if the file doesn't give you permission to.
A hard link makes an additional directory entry to a certain file. You
delete the directory entry to the file, not the file.
And permissions are the same for all instances of the file.
My 2 cents.
