It seemed, at least on the simple kernel compile tests that I did, that all
the long chains are not anonymous. It killed 95% of the space issue, which
given the simplicity of the patch was pretty damned stunning. Yes, there's
a pointer per page I guess we could kill in the struct page itself, but I
think you already have a better method for killing mem_map bloat ;-)
