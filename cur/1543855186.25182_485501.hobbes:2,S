I'll try noapic.  (though I value my apic more than s2ram;)

Will do.  (not tomorrow though, helping friend with home construction)
I found the driver that was causing my panic problem with vanilla, it
was my Sat TV card.  I haven't ever used it with Linux, and haven't used
it with that other OS but a couple of times to try it out(stupid stupid
purchase), so I tossed it.
Box still paniced though, apparently after restoring all drivers (last
trace mark was end of function marker).  I disabled trace, and enabled
the "leave console active, danger danger" option in hopes of capturing
the panic, and what do you know, for the first time ever, box restored
all the way into X... only to panic about two seconds later.  Nothing
whatsoever got to my serial console.  Switching to a text console before
suspend didn't help either, the panic is invisible.  Drat.
I'll toss rocks at it.
