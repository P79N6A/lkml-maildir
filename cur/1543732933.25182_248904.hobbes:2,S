cpu_online_map is not set up at the time of sched domain initialization
when hotplug cpu paths are used for SMP booting. At this phase of
bootstrapping, cpu_possible_map can be used by the various
architectures using cpu hotplugging for SMP bootstrap, but the
manipulations of cpu_online_map done on behalf of NUMA architectures,
done indirectly via node_to_cpumask(), can't, because cpu_online_map
starts depopulated and hasn't yet been populated. On true NUMA
architectures this is a distinct cpumask_t from cpu_online_map and so
the unpatched code works on NUMA; on non-NUMA architectures the
definition of node_to_cpumask() this way breaks and would require an
invasive sweeping of users of node_to_cpumask() to change it to e.g.
cpu_possible_map, as cpu_possible_map is not suitable for use at
runtime as a substitute for cpu_online_map.
