Hello,
I have a situation in which sending ioctls from a user
application to an HBA at the same time as active I/Os
running on the same card causes a critical error as - 
PCI excessive retry error.
I would like to know what can be the causes of such a
problem and what type of solution can resolve such 
problems.....?
- Thank you
