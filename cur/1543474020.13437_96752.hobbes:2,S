Hello,
To start: This message is mainly intended for active
kernel-programmers/hackers, but ofcourse other may give it a piece of
their mind :)
Since we are in stage before releasing an end-user product, it might be
a good idea to start cleaning up the (old experimental) source code. The
source code is poluted with (most likely) old experimental stuff not being
used. And other warnings (most likely non-fatal ones) but worth
investigating.
Even the simplest warning could mean that system-administrators are not
willing to switch, because of the assumption it's not finished yet. (could
be partially right). And could of course mean a lot of unnecesary messages
posted to linux-kernel/newsgroups (my mailbox isn't interested).
So now is the time for us to check to see if some warnings aren't
necessary. (I could imagine some unused variable warnings, staying there
because of compatibility issues). We might just find some interesting bugs
or something similar.
Most of the warnings could (probably) be solved very simple, but I leave
that up to the maintainers to decide. Don't want to mess around with some
bunch of people who already thought things out...
One thing on the first set of warnings:
 These header file only apply for certain processors (mostly only ppc),
and one doesn't exist in any processor list, pherhaps a leftover from the
earlier days :)
b.t.w.  This is just an issue to think about, so don't start jumping all
over me, cause that really would upset my providers mail-server ;)
