Well, first of all I simply did not see SO_ORIGINAL_DST exists.
While that means recoding applications, it is certainly the nicer
way - and most applications like squid (or my patched ssh) need to do
something special in that place anyway. The approach does pose some
problems, though:
- what should I #include to get at the SO_ORIGINAL_DST #define?
  The include/ directory from the netfilter distribution is not
  installed anywhere. The includes crossreference each other.
  so something like
	'ln -s /some/where/netfilter-0.1.9/include /usr/include/netfilter'
  (and then #include <netfilter/NAT/ip_nat.h>) does not work.
  I don't see an elegant way out of this.
- after finding testsuite/get_address (well, not really, I first grepped
  through the kernel for some time :), it was clear that I should use
  SOL_IP in the getsockopt() call. 
- the call works for root, but not for an ordinary user. The same getsockopt()
  call (e.g. using get_address) that succeeds for root, returns EPERM for my
  own processes. The cause, if I don't misread, is these lines in
  net/core/netfilter.c:nf_sockopt
        if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
                return -EPERM;
  I am not using the capability mechanism, but I'll assume I don't have
  that as a normal user (and squid, apache and consorts also won't have
  it, hopefully). So, I vote for removing that check, at least for the
  GET part of the equation, or better: move it into the individual handlers
  instead of that central place.
Find appended the source for an 'nf_getsockname()' function, with the
SO_ORIGINAL_DST #defined locally to work around the #include stuff.
My ssh is happily using that (when run as root :), and for squid and
other applications it should simply be a matter of linking that function
in, and replacing all calls to 'getsockname' with 'nf_getsockname'.
Rusty, as an alternative to this approach, how would you like the
kernel side getsockname() implementation to try SO_ORIGINAL_DST in-kernel?
That way user level need not care, sk_buff and struct sock is left alone,
and there's only that one place learning a small bit about NAT. Still a
bit ugly and inconsequential, but I would prefer that.

/* nf_getsockname() - netfilter SO_ORIGINAL_DST variant of getsockname()
 *
 * Within the new Linux netfilter framework, NAT functionality is cleanly
 * separated from the TCP/IP core processing. In old days, you could easily
 * retrieve the original destination (IP address and port) of a transparently
 * proxied connection by calling the normal getsockname() syscall.
 * With netfilter, getsockname() returns the real local IP address and port.
 * However, the netfilter code gives all TCP sockets a new socket option,
 * SO_ORIGINAL_DST, for retrieval of the original IP/port combination.
 *
 * This file implements a function nf_getsockname(), with the same calling
 * convention as getsockname() itself; it uses SO_ORIGINAL_DST, and if that
 * fails, falls back to using getsockname() itself.
