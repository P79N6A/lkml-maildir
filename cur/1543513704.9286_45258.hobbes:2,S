in drivers/scsi this device checks for MODULE and PCMCIA to determine
what to do with aha152_setup. The problem is that if PCMCIA not the one
in the kernel, but the original (complete) pcmcia_cs, the kernel does
not know what to do. The result is an undefined symbol, aha152x_setup,
if pcmcia_cs is used because both MODULE and PCMCIA will be false.
