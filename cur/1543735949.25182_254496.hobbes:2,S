It may re-order write vs. reads, nobody complained because on most old
machines, the CPU would be too dumb to do really heavy re-ordering but
that is no longer the case. This is definitely a bug.

Hrm... having a quick look at mga driver in current Xorg tree, it uses
the MMIO_IN/OUT macros directly, those are not byteswapping ?
It also does this at one point (ugh !) :
#if X_BYTE_ORDER == X_BIG_ENDIAN
	/* Disable byte-swapping for big-endian architectures - the XFree
	   driver seems to like a little-endian framebuffer -ReneR */
	/* pReg->Option |= 0x80000000; */
	pReg->Option &= ~0x80000000;
#endif
Weird... I think the X driver just lacks any "knowledge" of what's going
on with endianness...

It's not that "__raw_*" does not work for my hardware ... it's that __raw_*
is always wrong to use on MMIO register accesses (unless you know _exactly_ 
what you are doing, for example it may be acceptable for filling a fifo in
some cases provided the first & last writes are not __raw)
