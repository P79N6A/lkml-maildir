Hm, but do you think this is really good in overall performance, especially the
frequent cases where no swap should be needed _at all_ to do a successful
shrinking? And - as can be viewed in Martins tests - if you have no swap at
all, you seem to trigger OOM earlier through the short path exit in shrink,
which is a obvious nono. I would state it wrong to fix the oom-killer for this
case, because it should not be reached at all.
