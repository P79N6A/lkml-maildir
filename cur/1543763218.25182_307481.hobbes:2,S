Um, that's exactly why reply-to-all should be used, because not everyone
who posts to LKML subscribes to the list.  Otherwise, you'd either have
to make everyone who posts a question or a bug report subscribe to the
list to see the replies, or place the burden on the responder to keep
track of who wants to be cc'ed and who doesn't.
Beaised, even if you disagree with them, when you post to LKML you abide
by the LKML rules.  It's up to you to know what those are.
