This change permits driver writers to allow userspace to enable/disable 
driver-specific boolean options on a per-interface basis.  This is best 
illustrated by describing how userland uses this:
(this is very similar to how the get-stats and self-test operations 
currently work)
1) Userland issues ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO, to obtain the n_priv_flags value.
2) Userland issues ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS (ETH_SS_PRIV_FLAGS) to obtain an 
array of strings.  Each element in this array maps to a bit in the list 
of driver-private flags.  Array element #0 is the tag (name) for bit #0. 
  Array element #5 is the tag for bit #5.  etc.
If we are getting (retrieving) flags:
	3) Userland issues ETHTOOL_GPFLAGS, to obtain a 32-bit bitmap
	4) Userland prints out a tag returned from ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS
	   for each bit set to one in the bitmap.  If a bit is set,
	   but there is no string to describe it, that bit is ignored.
	   (i.e. a list of 5 strings is returned, but bit 24 is set)
If we are setting flags:
	3) Userland issues ETHTOOL_GPFLAGS, to obtain 32-bit bitmap
	4) Userland parses command line, which has a series of strings
	   in the format of "+option" (set flag) and "-option" (clear
	   flag).
	5) Userland sets and clears bits in the 32-bit bitmap, by
	   matching the command line-supplied data with strings returned
	   by ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS.
	6) If the bitmap has changed, send it back to the driver using
	   ETHTOOL_SPFLAGS.
In this way, you can see that the actual bit numbers are irrelevant, and 
need not be a fixed part of the ABI.  Everything is named-based.
This name-based stuff only applies to the private flags.  The 
ETHTOOL_[GS]FLAGS operations /do/ fix the bit numbers in stone, in the 
ABI.  There is no name list associated with ETHTOOL_[GS]FLAGS].  The 
userland interface does, however, use names rather than bit numbers, for 
ease of use.
Another attribute is worth pointing out at this point:  ETHTOOL_SFLAGS 
and ETHTOOL_SPFLAGS both permit atomic retrieval/setting of groups of 
features all at once.  IMO this is a nice addition to ethtool as well, 
where previously you had to issue separate ioctls for each feature, 
which might result in repeated NIC resets [depending on driver 
implementation].
Get-flags and get-priv-flags are unpriveleged operations.  Set-flags and 
set-priv-flags require CAP_NET_ADMIN like other ethtool sub-ioctls.
Drivers should return -EINVAL if userland attempts to set an invariant 
(read-only) flag to something other than its constant value.
