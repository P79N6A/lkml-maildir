The real reason i brought this up is because so much trouble was taken to 
implement an OOM handler yet this obviously known and simple situation 
totally bypasses it.  What situation does the OOM handler even work at?  I 
would think that if anything actually tried mapping all of free memory, 
anything else would error out and you'd just move to one of the terminals 
open and kill the process.
The only situation i can think of that the OOM would come into use is leaking 
memory but isn't that the same situation that I discribed occuring?   What's 
different?   And how is it that the kernel creating 600MB of buffer was 
normal instead of keeping some so my other programs could stay alive?  Or 
would it have not even mattered since there is a problem rooted in the vm io 
subsystem that allows situations like this?  
Also, is the idea of preemption in the VM being thought of for 2.5?  Seems 
like something like that would make this kind of problem mute.  
I'm tempted to test out Andrea's vm to see if it locks just as easily.
