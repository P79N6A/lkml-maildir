I don't like spam.

I'm all for anti-spam when it's done right.

You missed my qualifier.  I asked that ORBS not be used while they practice
their policy of global blacklisting.  I fully support ORBS in it's efforts
to stop spam by affecting the broken systems.  Any servers on Above.net
address space that are open should be listed.  The other hundreds of
thousands should remain fully free.  Especially when the ones I touch are
listed in the database as anti-spam compliant.
I draw the line when they shoot the whole city just to stop a dozen people.
I don't speak as a rep from VA.  Nor is this a paltry face for spam.  In my
view, VA's position on spam is great.  Nobody likes spam.  I'm not blaming
anyone for other people's problems.  I'm saying ORBS is practicing a group
prejudice.
Not everyone in the world has the freedom to choose a different provider. 
That anti-spam abiding citizen shouldn't have to face the blacklist because
his provider has blocked ORBS from testing.
My mail server XYZ is anti-spam compliant and listed as such in the ORBS
database, why then is it being blacklisted?
linux-kernel isn't about stereotype programming, we go through pains to make
sure the kernel operates for as many types as possible.  We aren't
intentionally refusing to write support simply because of bias.  We can't
[currently] provide industrial crypto in the mainstream kernel in US
locations, but there are patches on the outside of the US that people can
get.
Is generic blacklisting right?
