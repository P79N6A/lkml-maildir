Most certainly not for now.

I didn't say it was infeasible.  On the contrary, I too wanted (am
wanting) to rework sbp2 so that it instantiates only a single
Scsi_Host globally or per FireWire initiator port.  It's just one
of the things that I always pushed back, and where the devil is in
the detail.  (Notably if multiple targets, not just multiple LUs
of one target, live beneath one Scsi_Host.)
