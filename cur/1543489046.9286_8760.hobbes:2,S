I checked them again, and the files they point to, just in case... 
Unfortunatly they seem to be in order...
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network stop is the penultimate thing that happens, just
before /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt
But! It is indeed strange that I get a ENETUNREACH, and if I would not have
been so tired tonight... :-) 
Putting a sleep 10 after killproc portmap in /etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap also 
solves the problem... Those 10 seconds is a cheap price to pay for avoiding
a half hour journey and an hour of ckraid and fsck :-)
Thanks!
