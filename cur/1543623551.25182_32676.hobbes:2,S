Subject: a faster way to gettimeofday?

I have a program that I very often need to calculate the current
time, with milisecond accuracy.  I've been using gettimeofday(),
but gprof shows it's taking a significant (10% or so) amount of
time.  Is there a faster (and perhaps less portable?) way to get
the time information on x86?  My program runs as root, so should
have any permissions it needs to use some backdoor hack if that
helps!
Thanks,
Ben
