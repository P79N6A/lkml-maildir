Ah true.

Nvidia/ATI and other binary modules exist too and users will probably unhappy 
if they cannot run them anymore.
But at usually irq state changes should be patched in anyways and won't
need paravirt I guess? 
Hmm, actually thinking about it the module loader probably has no clue
that the relocation it linked will be overwritten so it'll check
for the export anyways.
So the alternatives would be to add ugly hacks to the module loader
or split paravirt_ops in "common" and "low level system" areas or 
export it as a normal export.
Not sure what's best. Ok using a normal export is easiest and not
that big an issue.
