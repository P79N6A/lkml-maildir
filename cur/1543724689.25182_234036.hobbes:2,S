It would be the former owner of the block.

Stale data yes, but probably not stale data from blocks that were
formerly free (or the file system is insecure).

So, how do you tell?

Where is data not critical?  I had such a problem even with a
widely-used application like GNU Emacs (many years ago, may be fixed
now), casting doubt on your claim that fixing the application is easy.

You mean ext3 data=journal?  The last I heard about it was that it was
broken.
ext3 data=ordered will probably also work better in most cases than an
FS with eager meta-data updates (like, apparently, XFS), but I don't
think it guarantees in-order semantics.
