You do not need 8 bit characters in kernel code it's as simple as
that. If you really insist, then post the patch in pure 8 bit,
quoted-unreadable is brain damage and deserves to die the sooner the
better. If there is a broken mail server somewhere in the way (which
is really really rare these days) let the people who are behind that
server suffer and not everybody else.
Besides, quoted-unreadable makes it hard to just do 
patch < $MAILDIR/linux-kernel/<mail-number>
