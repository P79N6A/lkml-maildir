Hi again Eric,
Thank you for your comments so far.

I had hoped that I would get a more detailed answer. I asked you the
following follow-up questions during the first round:
---
I suppose you mean that control pages have additional protection that
struct kimage does _not_ have. Protection provided by
kimage_alloc_control_pages(), right?
I agree with you that this protection is good. But I do not see how
that applies to my patch, because the page_table_a[] pages pointed out
by struct kimage are read out by machine_kexec() and passed as
arguments to the assembly code. So the assembly code itself never
tries to access struct kimage. All data accessed by the assembly code
is allocated with kimage_alloc_control_pages(), isn't that good
enough? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding?
---
I'm trying to understand your argument, but it does not make sense to me.
If you are worried that struct kimage will get overwritten by
background DMA, then why the are you storing the pointer to the
control page there? That pointer is _very_ important...
And if your DMA issue it is that important, why do you not allocate
struct kimage from kimage_alloc_control_pages()?

That makes sense.

I see it from the other side. By _not_ having per-architecture data
the current kexec code for x86_64 unnecessarily allocates 2 physically
contiguous pages (1-order allocation).

But then I would have to make the code overly complex and duplicate
code that overloads the control page with a structure - both for i386
and x86_64. By adding a per-architecture data structure the amount of
code duplication is reduced IMO.

Good. I'm sorry that the patches are unreadable, they tend to get that
when one is modifying major parts of a file. I'd recommend that
instead of reading the patch directly it may be better to apply it and
read the resulting code.

Yes and no. I agree that modifying kernel code to fit code outside of
the tree is a bad thing, but I think my modification alone has value
for the kernel.
I think we both can agree on that overwriting the current page tables
should be avoided regardless of Xen. It's just a matter of where we
store data and if we are using one or two page tables.

I don't want to break it either, so careful is good. I think kexec
works pretty well, but I would not say it's working correctly in all
cases.
One issue on i386 with the current page table overwriting code is that
it may break with different kernel/userspace splits. I think my
"page_table_a" approach should work for all cases.
Also, I cannot get one x86_64 box here to work with kexec. It does not
work with the vanilla kexec, and not with my page_table_a patch. The
troublesome machine has a cpu reported as "AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor
3200+". The same code does however run on hardware with dual "AMD
Opteron(tm) Processor 244".
I'd like to work on solving these issues too, but I'd like to sort out
merging my current patches before starting on something new.
Thanks,
