The Coverity checker spotted the following in 
drivers/usb/serial/aircable.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static void aircable_read(void *params)
{
        struct usb_serial_port *port = params;
        struct aircable_private *priv = usb_get_serial_port_data(port);
        struct tty_struct *tty;
        unsigned char *data;
        int count;
        if (priv->rx_flags & THROTTLED){
                if (priv->rx_flags & ACTUALLY_THROTTLED)
                        schedule_work(&priv->rx_work);
                return;
        }
        /* By now I will flush data to the tty in packages of no more than
         * 64 bytes, to ensure I do not get throttled.
         * Ask USB mailing list for better aproach.
         */
        tty = port->tty;
        if (!tty)
                schedule_work(&priv->rx_work);
        count = min(64, serial_buf_data_avail(priv->rx_buf));
        if (count <= 0)
                return; //We have finished sending everything.
        tty_prepare_flip_string(tty, &data, count);
...
<--  snip  -->
"tty" is first checked for being !NULL, but later it's unconditionally 
dereferenced.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
