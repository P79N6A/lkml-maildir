Bugzilla is for tracking bugs, not for discussing possible
kernel features.
Tracking feature or implementation suggestions wouldn't make sense. 
Consider e.g. that there are several people on linux-kernel who often 
write what they think the kernel should do but who never write a single 
line of code themselves. There's no value in tracking such stuff.

What do you have in mind?
I've always been able to do any search I wanted using the "Advanced Search"
of Bugzilla. Well, just checking, it seems the search for the new
"regression" flag could be made easier, but that's not a general problem.
But what could be improved in the database would be to fix the 
charset problems for getting the RSS feeds working (#8774).  ;-)

Documentation makes sense, but it belongs into some place like the 
kernelnewbies wiki, not the Bugzilla itself.

Preferences settings plus saved searches already work.

There's a "Home" link that does exactly this among the actions offered

The only thing that comes into my mind is that you cannot reassign a bug 
and change it's status in one step. But "flaws and problems" would IMHO 
be too hard an expression since it works fine with two updates.

Sounds like a good solution for the one question so many submitters get 
wrong.  :-)

Bugzilla isn't that bad and it has the advantage of being the most 
popular bug tracking system for open source projects, which means that 
most likely every kernel developer and many submitters have already used
a Bugzilla at some other project.
From past discussions my impression was that several kernel developers 
have an email based workflow and are reluctant to integrate web based 
actions into their workflow.
I'd say the success of any bigger Bugzilla change or switch to a 
different or writing of a new bug tracking system could be measured
by answering the following question:
  Will Linus Torvalds and David Miller use it?
