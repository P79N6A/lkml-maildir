You can specify a .o file in another directory. Do you really need a .a
file? oprofile for ones does this. xfs is another example.

Assuming you are talking about the kernel then the kernel build system
is optimised for buiding the kernel.
And the kernel source keep relevant files together as much as possible.
See for example drivers/net. A lot of files, but most of them is a net
driver so no value gained introducing a directory for a simple driver.
And experience has shown that usage of libaries has resulted in more
problems than it has solved in most cases. Thats why libraries are so
seldom used in the kernel.
When do you need to include crc32.o in the kernel for instance.
