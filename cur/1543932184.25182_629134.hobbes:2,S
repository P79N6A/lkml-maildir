Well, I'll admit to being a little disappointed if my work doesn't make
it in, but there are bugfixes here.  I think my cleanup breakout is
better in the more-finegrained changes sense.  If you decide to keep
mine I'll rebase Masami's patches 1-4 on top of that and send it by
him for resubmittal.  But I'll leave it to Ingo to decide how
to procede.
