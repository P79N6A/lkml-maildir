In Linux 2.2.0 - 2.2.5, running out of memory on my dual Pentium 233/MMX
machine with Tyan Tomcat IV board invariably gives me the message:
stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU #[0|1])
The machine never recovers afterward and Magic SysRq does not work.  It's
reset button time.  The time it happens varies from 50 megabytes into swap
to 1 megabyte into swap.
