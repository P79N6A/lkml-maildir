In general s_flags is changed under sb->s_umount (write) semaphore
inside various get_sb(), fill_super() and remount_fs() filesystem functions.
Exceptions are:
1) do_emergency_remount -- where s_umount(read) is taken,
2) various filesystem error-handlers (like ext3_abort() and reiserfs_abort()),
when filesystem "remounted" to read-only without any locks.
Thank you,
