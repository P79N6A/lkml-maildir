ok, in other words:
2.6.16: end result: direct access; if direct doesn't work: pcibios
2.6.17: end result: pci bios (only direct if pcibios fails! )
2.6.17+patch: end result: direct access; if direct doesn't work: pcibios
=> net result is the same, but less code is executed, order is clear always.

no, a quirk is bad for the simple reason that 2.6.16 used to work on systems
(laptops) where 2.6.17 fails for cardbus...there's no way you can wait on all
the reports and add quirks for them one-by-one. and distros are still using
kernel < 2.6.17...
btw. it's commit 92c05fc1a32e5ccef5e0e8201f32dcdab041524c
([PATCH] PCI: Give PCI config access initialization a defined ordering)
that broke things on those laptops. cc'ing Andi...
