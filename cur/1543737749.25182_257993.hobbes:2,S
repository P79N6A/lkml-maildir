ppc32 and ppc64 are identical by spec, but the current chips smaller
store queues are such that we didn't epxerience on ppc32 the amount
of issues we had on ppc64.
eieio will not order a cacheable store vs. a non-cacheable store by
spec, which is the root of our problem on ppc and why we had to change
some of these into sync's. Extended the semantics of mmiowb() to a more
generic ordering of MMIO vs. "the rest of the world" would help us as
I don't beleive in defining yet-another barrier and have it properly
used by device driver writers.
