Not all Bugs are mistakes of the coder. I still think it is not correct to
blame developers. And it is also not a good idea to treat helping hands as
second class only because they improve instead of create things.
Linux Kernel is developed in a collaborative evolutionary process. The
documentation change is completely wrong worded.
(However the idea to ask ppl to look for small clear tasks, especially if
not everybody has the option to work on it (hardware) is good) - and very
rewarding.
