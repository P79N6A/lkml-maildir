Ive used a 24X scsi cdrom and a IOMega Zip drive with my AVA-1515/1505
and havent noticed any problems with the aha152x driver I use under all
the 2.2.x kernels ive used.
Maybe i just havent bashed it hard enough, but I am using mine to run a
Seagate 767meg SCSI2 disk 24/7 for over a year without a hiccup on my main
dialup server, which handles email, web and proxy - gets a good hammering
on /usr and /var/spool.

I'd be intereste to see if some performance increases can be made with
this card/driver - I noticed what I'm using is very similar, although mine
(unsure if others are different) has a on-board bootable BIOS..
