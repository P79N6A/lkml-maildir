The main difference is that under Linux the size of the
inactive list is dynamic, while under FreeBSD the system
always tries to keep a (very) large inactive list around.
I'm not sure if, or how, this would influence the percentage
of dirty pages on the inactive list or how often we'd need to
flush something to disk as opposed to reclaiming clean pages.

The only number I saw when reading over this thread was that
Mike found that under one workload he tested the Linux kernel
ended up doing IO anyway about 2/3rds of the time.
This would also mean we'd be able to _avoid_ IO 1/3rd of the
time ;)

I'm not arguing against his numbers, all I want to know is
if the patch has the same positive effect on other workloads
as well...
