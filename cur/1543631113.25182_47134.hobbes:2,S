Or so as I do, and have a single source tree that's read-only, and
trees of links to the source tree that I build different
configurations from.
(The `touch' that   make depend   does really hurts here)

Personally, I'd prefer a rule like:
aic7xxx_seq.h aic7xxx_reg.h: %.h : shipped_%.h
	cp $< $@
otherwise an attempt to build with CONFIG_AIC7XXX_BUILD_FIRMWARE yes
after a build with no will fail.
