I'm fairly sure it's been mentioned before but there's some already, for
example:
http://opensource.wolfsonmicro.com/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=linux-2.6-audioplus.git;a=blob;f=arch/arm/mach-mx3/cpufreq.c;h=7a2d5154ada5fb58aeb49b261e6f08cb591b96b2;hb=refs/heads/imx31
Actually, I have some updates to that I should push, needs to be
