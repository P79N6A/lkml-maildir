If you guestimate that each dbench client uses about 20M of RAM then dbench
100 has no chance of remaining in memory. Once you hit disk then spinlock
optimisations are all in the noise :) Smaller runs (< 30) should see 
it stay in memory.
Also if you turn of kupdated (so old buffers are not flushed out just
because they are old) and make the VM more agressive about filling
memory with dirty buffers then you will not hit the disk and then
hopefully the optimisations will be more obvious.
killall -STOP kupdated
echo "90 64 64 256 500 3000 95 0 0" > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
Remember to killall -CONT kupdated when you are finished :)

The single CPU 333MHz POWER 3 I was playing with got 100MB/s when not
touching disk.
