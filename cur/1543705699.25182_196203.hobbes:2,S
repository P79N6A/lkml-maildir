This is bad:
akpm:/usr/src/25> grep '^+#ifdef' patches/kgdb-ga.patch | wc -l 
     83
and the fact that it touches 36 different files.
Any time I've had to do any maintenance work against that stub I get lost
in a twisty maze and just whine at George about it.  It's just all over the
place.  Yes, this is partly the nature of the beast, but I don't see that a
ton of effort has been put into reducing the straggliness.

Sounds good.
Look, there's a lot of interest in this and I of course am fully
supportive.  If someone could send me Amit's patchset when they think I
should test it, I could then talk about it more usefully.
