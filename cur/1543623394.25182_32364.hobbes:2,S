Because this is the same configuration which I will buy
(the very similar means I need only three but 4 3ware cards, and I have the 
option to buy a netgear card)
this doesn't help me.
Such systems are used at DESY in Hamburg 
with no problems 
(www.desy.de/unix/linux/delfi/delfi.html)
and therefore I want to know if the rate, firmware or the kernel or driver 
version makes the difference.
