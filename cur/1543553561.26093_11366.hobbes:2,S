All the MOD_INC/DEC_USE_COUNT are done inside the modules themselves. There
is nothing that would a driver prevent from being unloaded on a different
CPU while it is already executing in ->open but has not yet executed the add 
yet or after it has executed the _DEC but it is still running in module code
Normally the windows are pretty small, but very long running interrupt
on one CPU hitting exactly in the wrong moment can change that.
