Well I can assure you I used DiskFirstAid and Norton Utilities on the Mac.
Neither found any problems. Since I use MacOS9, my Mac crashes at least once a
month but I never ever lost anything. Most of the time my USB-keyboard/-mouse
doesn't react anymore after switching back from my Linux system. Usually I
simply press the reset switch after a few minutes. 
Besides Linux also does not react occasionally when switching my
USB-keyboard/-mouse but since I also have an AT-keyboard handy I don't have to
reset it.

I'm not bashing linux, I'm only stating that MacOS9 (or HFS+) has a nice feature
Linux (or its fs's) lacks. My experience shows clearly that I had at least 10
craches on the Mac durning the last year but I never lost anything. During the
same time I had 2 crashes on my linux, one due to the USB-problem without a
handy AT-keyboard, the second now due to a malfunction el3diag.
