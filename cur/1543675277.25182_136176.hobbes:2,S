Dear kernel developers,
I would like to report a suspect bug, newly introduced into 2.4.20 with respect
to correct 2.4.18.
Summary: errorneous netstat -i report about pcnet32 ethernet interface
Description: under 2.4.20 kernel with pcnet32 ethernet driver netstat -i reports 
Iface   MTU Met   RX-OK RX-ERR RX-DRP RX-OVR   TX-OK TX-ERR TX-DRP TX-OVR Flg
eth0   1500   0     138      0      0      0      0     155      0      0 BMRU
(all TX packets errorneous), but the network actually works most the time normally,
sometimes irreproducibly irregularly it hangs.
Kernel versions: Linux version 2.4.20-4GB (root@jp) (gcc version 3.2) #15 Mon May 26 22:56:39 CEST 2003
The source has been taken from SuSE 8.2 distribution
2.4.18.SUSE kernel works fine
I have tried to take just the drivers/net/pcnet32.c file from 2.4.18.SuSE
and use it instead of the newer pcnet32.c from the 2.4.20 (compiled and loaded as a module).
This works fine, pcnet32.o module from 2.4.18 sources compiled within  the 2.4.20 kernel and loaded as a module to the new kernel works!
So I am pretty sure the problem must be in the changes made between
2.4.18 and 2.4.20 versions of pcnet32.c

and from 2.4.20.SuSE is 
#define DRV_NAME        "pcnet32"
#define DRV_VERSION     "1.27b"
#define DRV_RELDATE     "01.10.2002"
