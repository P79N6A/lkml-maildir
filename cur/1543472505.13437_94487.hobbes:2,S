Since it was designed this way :-)

They are still low-level formatted, just not tested.

Great. Now take 1.88Mb floppy (maked with xdfcopy) and explain how to create
standard 1.44Mb floppy with mkfs.ext2 :-)) Format under DOS will do this quite
happily. Or even simpler: take 1.44Mb floppy and make 720Kb floppy from it
(this is safe). Again format under DOS will do this just fine.
P.S. May be you have specially modified mkfs.ext2 which could do low-level
format but standard mkfs.ext2 will do just it: create ext2fs filesystem on
low-level formatted driver.
