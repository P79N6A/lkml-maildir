PTRACE_GETREGS. Yeah, it's overhead, see my previous mails about various
levels of kernel features of how to do it potentially cheaper. Not like
the above process is particularly fast.
One more method to speed it up: to amortize the kernel entry overhead we
could introduce a new PTRACE_GETREGS_GROUP to get a full array of user
contexts from all group member threads, via a single system-call.

PTRACE_GETREGS gets you the instruction pointer and all general purpose 
registers, eax and the rest.
