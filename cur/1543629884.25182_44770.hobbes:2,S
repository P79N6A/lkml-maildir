Hi!
For swsusp, I kind of need to read 4K from given block device.
Here's my attempt:
static int bdev_read_page(kdev_t dev, long pos, void *buf)
{
        struct buffer_head *bh;
        struct block_device *bdev;
        if (pos%PAGE_SIZE) panic("Sorry, dave, I can't let you do
that!\n");
        bdev = bdget(kdev_t_to_nr(dev));
        if (!bdev) {
                printk("No block device for %s\n", __bdevname(dev));
                BUG();
        }
        printk("C");
        bh = __bread(bdev, pos/PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_SIZE);
        printk("D");
        bdput(bdev);
        if (!bh || (!bh->b_data)) {
                return -1;
        }
        memcpy(buf, bh->b_data, PAGE_SIZE);
        bforget(bh);                    /* FIXME: maybe bforget should
be here */
        return 0;
}
It works *once*, second time it deadlocks in __bread(). I tried both
bforget() and brelse(). Kernel is 2.5.13. What am I doing wrong/what's
wrong?
