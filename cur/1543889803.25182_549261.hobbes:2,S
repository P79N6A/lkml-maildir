First of all, what is an ssb device please? AFAICS it looks like an extension 
of b44.c as far as module selection is concerned in kernel configuration.
What it's function / purpose?
Does its function / purpose apply to every platform?

Should I? My broadcom 4401 is broken, but only in that specific mm1-tree.
It's not broken in 2.6.22-rc2 for instance. So that's your patch that breaks 
it.

I do not state that ssb is wrong, but I state that the ATTACHMENT of ssb to 
b44.c is wrong. That's a big difference.
In all earlier kernels that b44 device has been fine, and ssb has never been 
seen.

Nice for you, but on my machine it is broken, the broadcom 4401 onboard NIC 
controller is unusable.

But if APIC were broken all the other devices would not work too.
But they DO work!
Please correct me if I draw incorrect conclusions.
Do you mean to build a kernel without any ACPI functions?

Fine! Why do I get then a whole sum of correct interrupts while the only 
strange / false one (255) is exactly the one offered to b44.c?
And for what do I get that ssb module who's functionality I do not understand?
If you need futher info please ask. But the possibility that the whole APIC is 
broken is rather small I think. To exclude that I would rather rip out any 
APIC changes in 2.6.22-rc2-mm1, if there are any (didn't take a look for 
that - only found out that the whole system works fine with the exception of 
parts of the alsa architecture and this broken b44.c module.

Perhaps someone reading this could try to reproduce that problem on his 
machine.
Now who of the readers owes a Broadcom 4401 NIC and can please try to test 
kernel 2.6.22-rc2-mm1?
Those NICs have been used very very often as onboard controllers, especially 
on ASUS boards.
