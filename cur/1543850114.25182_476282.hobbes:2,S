That's the main technical item.  I guess I was hoping for some more
general feedback regarding the desirability of this patch: "Yes, this
is good.  Polish it off and we'll incorporate it," "No, we think the
status quo is fine," or something along those lines.
There is one point I forgot to mention.  I'm not sure what to do with
the audit_bprm() function.  It tries to copy the entire argument array
into a kmalloc'ed region, which isn't gonig to fly if we allow the
argument list to grow arbitrarily large.
