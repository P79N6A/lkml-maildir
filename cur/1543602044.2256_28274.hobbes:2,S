The soundcard will skip whenever there is not enough data for it to
play, this would be caused by the mp3 player not getting the needed CPU
time (or the PCI bus is saturated or some such).
This could be caused by more than just irq requests -- anytime the
kernel can't schedule the mp3 player readily enough.  With the
preemption patch, this can occur during not just interrupt handling but
any concurreny lock.

By design, preemption does not occur under any lock (right now we use
SMP locks).  This means all the spinlocks in the kernel disable
preemption, the big kernel lock disables preemption, irq_off obviously
does, etc.
What we need to do now is identify the long held locks and -- if they
are causing problems -- do something about them.
