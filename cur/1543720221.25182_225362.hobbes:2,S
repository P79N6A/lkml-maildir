Hello,
a new version of the uClinux cross-compiler toolchain
based on GCC 3.4 is available here:
 
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uclinux-elf-tools/gcc-3/
This release adds preliminary ARM support and includes
binaries for Linux (both glibc23 and glibc22 distros) and
Cygwin.
Many other things have been changed since the last public
announcement:
Changes in release 20040605:
        * Preliminary GCC 3.5 support.
        * Add some GCC 3.4 patches by Peter Barada.
        * Add support for GDB 6.1.
        * Update m68k-bdm to 1.3.0 and use GDB patches distributed with it.
        * Integrate preliminary ARM support.
        (Contributed by Steve Miller <steve.miller@st.com>).
        * Fix genromfs patch for CygWin.
        (Reported by Jens Heilig <jens@familie-heilig.net>).
Changes in release 20040425:
        * Update GCC 3.4 to the official 3.4.0 release.
        * Update m68k-bdm to 1.2.0.
Changes in release 20040323:
        * Update GCC 3.4 to the 20040317 snapshot.
        * Update binutils to 2.15.90.0.1.1, which already contains all
        the required uClinux patches.
        * Backport argument pointer corruption fix to GCC 3.3.3
Changes in release 20040309:
        * Drop Insight support (DDD is better anyway) and install GDB in $PREFIX.
        * Rename "interrupt" attribute to "interrupt_handler" in 3.3.x patches
        to match GCC 3.4.
Changes in release 20040112:
        * Update GCC 3.4 to 3.4-20040114.
        * Update uClibc to 0.9.26.
        * Update binutils to 2.14.90.0.8 (and drop some integrated patches).
        * Cleanup support for backwards compatibility links to m68k-elf- tools.
        * Correctly detect GCC version for interim releases.
        * Apply a couple of rogue patches to GCC 3.4.
        * Fix build with gcc-java, but don't expect it to work right now.
Changes in release 20031230:
        * Switch to m68k-uclinux for all components of the GCC 3.4 toolchain.
        * GCC's compiler driver now adds required linker flags when building
        executables with -mid-shared-libary.
        * Update uClibc to 0.9.24.
        * Update m68k-bdm to 20031207 and import latest GDB patches.
        * Update GCC 3.4 to 3.4-20031222.
        * Update GCC 3.3.x to 3.3-20031222.
        * Merge-in patches by Andrea Tarani for uClibc 0.9.23 and m68k-bdm.
