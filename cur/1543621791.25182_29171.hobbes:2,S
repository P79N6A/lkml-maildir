Subject: e2fsck compatibility problem with 2.4.17?

Hi,
I am having a problem that might be due to an incompatibility between
e2fsck and kernel 2.4.17.
My machine has a redhat kernel 2.4.3-12 and a kernel 2.4.17 I have 
recently built from source.
While doing a routine filesystem check at boot time (running kernel 
2.4.17), e2fsck found a problem with one of the partitions (I am using 
e2fsck 1.25 from the redhat rawhide rpm  e2fsprogs-1.25-2.i386.rpm).
I decided not to fix the problem and checked it with a different kernel
and version 1.19 of e2fsck. In both cases, the partition was clean.
So, I get:
kernel     e2fsck    result
2.4.17      1.25     problem
2.4.3-12    1.25      OK
2.4.3-12    1.19      OK
Are there any know incompatibilities between kernel 2.4.17 and e2fsck
1.25? Right now, I am not sure if the filesystem is damaged or not!
The error I get is the following:
1) e2fsck gets stuck after only checking 2.5% of the partition. It stays
   there for about 5 minutes doing clik-clak noises until starting giving
errors
2) First error is:
Block 32783 - 32791 (attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in
short read) while doing inode scan.
3) Then in Pass 2:
resources in /src/linux-2.4.3/drivers/acpi (1894) has deleted/unused
inode 16435.
And it keeps giving many similar messages....
If it is useful I can try to get the full output. This has been 100% 
reproducible in my system.
Thank you,
	-Joao
