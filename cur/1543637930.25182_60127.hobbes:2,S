free it if you are returning zero.  But of course, after the card has 
handled the packet.
If you set your MTU correctly, you shouldn't get frames larger than 
proper length.
netif_stop_queue and netif_start_queue and netif_wake_queue are your 
queue management tools.  _only_ enable the queue when there is room for 
more packets.
