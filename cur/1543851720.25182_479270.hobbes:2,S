Yes, the driver needs to be loaded.
Basically, Auke wants you to throw away your NIC and/or motherboard. 
Since you're effectively dead, the only damage you can do by disabling 
the check has already been done.  This unfortunately seems to be fairly 
common with e100, especially for the on-motherboard version, and you 
basically have two options: either disable the check or write an offline 
tool to reprogram the EEPROM.
The latest netdev tree (if it's not in Linus' tree already, which it 
might be) does add back the option to ignore the check so you can update 
the EEPROM, which will automatically fix the checksum.
