The patch in question is an interface to user space.  The problem with
those is that you can't put them in and refine them because the user
visible interface changes when you do that.

The pot is calling the kettle black here, since libata was supposed to
have moved out of SCSI about three years ago by helping us move the
shared elements up to block.  As far as I can tell, the only progress
we've made in this area is me adding the odd API shift.
