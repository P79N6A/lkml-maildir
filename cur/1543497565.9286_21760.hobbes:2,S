Only one comment on the ACL page disturbed me: the one about lower
performance. It was a little ambiguous. Performance hit is only taken when
you deal with inodes with ACL's set, right? i.e. I could have ACL support
turned on for a given filesystem, but no inodes using ACLs, and
performance would be identical, right?
