Hi there.
 > What's the max file size on ext2 ?
Depends on the architecture - 2 Gigabytes on 32-bit architectures,
somewhere around 9,200 Exabytes on 64-bit architectures.
 > A friend of mine told me that he cannot create files larger than

I have had several files in the 1.2G to 1.6G range on my system, which
uses 1k blocks, so his problems are not due to any ext2 limits.
 > (I can't verify that because my largest partition is 512KB)
I have floppies with higher capacity than that...presumably you meant
512M rather than 512K !!!
Best wishes from Riley.
