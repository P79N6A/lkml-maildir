Subject: [patch] deadlock over timerlist_lock

One can't do a printk() with timerlist_lock held.  This is
because the console code does a mod_timer(), which
acquires timerlist_lock.

 static inline int detach_timer (struct timer_list *timer)
BTW: this implies that the NMI oopser should bust
timerlist_lock as well as console_lock.  Also,
the oops code in do_page_fault() should also bust both
spinlocks before trying to print.  And if we're using
a serial console there may be a different set of spinlocks
which need busting. And the fbdev drivers...   I'll take
a look.
