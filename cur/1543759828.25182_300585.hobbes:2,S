Hi Jens,
Thanks for the reply.  I tried your patch, and also setting hdparm -W0.
The warning is still there.  This warning and the previous ones I reported
should be irrelevant to IDE drivers, as FiSC (our FS checker) doesn't
actually crash the machine but simulates a crash using a ramdisk.
It appears to me that this warning can be triggered by the following steps:
1. create a file A with several data blocks. fsync(A) to disk
2. truncate A to a smaller size, causing a few blocks to be freed.
However, they are only freed in memory.  The corresponding changes in
bitmaps haven't yet hit the disk.
3. create a file B with several data blocks.  ext2 will re-use the freed
blocks from step 2.
4. fsync(B).  Once fsync returns, crash.
At this moment, the truncate in step 2 hasn't reached the disk yet, so the
file A on disk still contains pointers to the freed blocks.  However, the
fsync(B) in step 4 flushes B's inode and other metadata to disk.  Now we
end up with a file system where a block is shared by two files.
I'm not sure how the invalid block number warning is triggered.
