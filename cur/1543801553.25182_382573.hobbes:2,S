Hannu,
This is the LKML. So, we are considering KERNEL code. Not some external 
binary blob. We are therefore suggesting to remove the kernel OSS 
drivers as that is all we have to compare with ALSA.
We can't compare a binary blob with open source as the binary blob will 
never be part of mainline.
Even you admit that the OSS drivers in the kernel mainline are "really 
obsolete", so you must agree with this thread that we should remove them.
Only if your binary blobs are released as GPL so that they can be 
included in mainline can it really be any use to discuss them.
