Diff between 2.2.20pre2aa1 and 2.2.20pre3aa1 (besides moving on top of
2.2.20pre3 that notably fixes the ptrace local DoS races):
------------------------------------------------------------
Only in 2.2.20pre2aa1: 00_andi-mark_bh-1
	Merged in 2.2.20pre3.
Only in 2.2.20pre3aa1: 00_alpha-pci-compile-1
	Fix alpha pci_controller_num.
	(recommended)
Only in 2.2.20pre3aa1: 00_newboot-2.2.20-pre2-1.diff.gz
	Support new boot protocol in sync with 2.4 for new bootloaders.
	(nice to have)
Only in 2.2.20pre3aa1: 00_nfs-lseek-1
	Make SEEK_CUR offset 0 to return the current vfs file offset on nfs to
	cure userspace. Fix from Andi.
	(recommended)
Only in 2.2.20pre2aa1: 00_parent-timeslice-loss-fix-3
Only in 2.2.20pre3aa1: 00_parent-timeslice-loss-fix-4
	Rebuild the asm_offsets.h for sparc and sparc64 after the ptrace fix
	and fixup the trivial reject generated by the ptrace DoS fixes.
	(recommended)
Only in 2.2.20pre3aa1: 00_tcp-syn-during-established-1
	Reject any duplicate syn carrying payload, process the syn
	during established after checking if rst is set in the incoming
	packet (that's a faster path) and send ack back after a duplicate
	valid syn. From Andi.
	(recommended)
