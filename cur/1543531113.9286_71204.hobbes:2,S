Thank you for your help :) I tried the above setting but it does not seem to
solve any problem because there is not any misconfigurative abnormality.
Yes 0x237 with irq 5 is the setting that i choose to have for the printer but
this is not the problem. I also set it win 0x378 with irq=7 and it accept it
but the problem seems to be based in posible filter uncompatibility in the print
tool.
When i add a printer using the printtool the port is detected. By trying the
Epson Stylus Color (UP) filter the result of testing the printer is a dead end.
It says that the page is currently printed WITHOUT ANY ERROR (!) and the
printer stays quiet without printing nothing! 8-(
In the process of test printing the printer queue seems to be pushed by the
print job and after a little its contents are poped to nowhere without having a
printed page!
Any ideas for posible compatible filters from any other printer vendor are
useful to me.
