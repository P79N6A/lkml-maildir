Okay, here's the new hdparm information for this:
Capabilities:
	...
        DMA: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 *udma4
             Cycle time: min=120ns recommended=120ns
        PIO: pio0 pio1 pio2 pio3 pio4
             Cycle time: no flow control=120ns  IORDY flow control=120ns
Commands/features:
        Enabled Supported:
                Write cache
           *    CFA feature set
           *    CFA advanced modes: pio5 *pio6
So, udma4 and pio6 are the fastest supported speeds.
According to the CFA specifications (v4.1), either of those modes
requires SHORT cables and special handling.   You probably have
regular (16-18") cables, and libata doesn't support PIO6,
and the motherboard chipset may not support the "special handling"
requirements in other ways.  Also, only one device on the cable.
I see from your earlier posting that libata selected UDMA/66 (udma4)
for the device though, since libata doesn't know that your cable
is too long.  And that mode is working, so that's probably as good
as it gets on that particular motherboard chipset.
Some cards may perform better when their "memory" interface is used
instead of the "I/O" interface, or vice-versa.  I'm not sure which
of the two methods was selected by libata (probably the "memory" interface).
There is also a "PC-Card" style interface with shared-memory,
which some USB readers *may* use as an alternative to the standard
IDE/ATA style interface.
Cheers
