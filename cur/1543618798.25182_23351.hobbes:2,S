So I compiled sched.c to assembly (note that I have the rml preempt patch
there too), and the results are pretty strange:
Diff between -O2 and -Os:
http://giron.wox.org/sched.s.diff
As you can see, not much size optimizing are done from -O2.
The C file:
http://giron.wox.org/sched.c
Command line:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -OX \
    -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -S sched.c
where -OX have been replaced by -O0 -O2 -O3 and -Os
The assembler files:
http://giron.wox.org/sched.s.o0
http://giron.wox.org/sched.s.o2
http://giron.wox.org/sched.s.o3
http://giron.wox.org/sched.s.os
The file created with -O0 (no optimization) is the biggest of all, even
bigger than -O3.
-O2 and -Os differ only about 1%
So either
a) -O2 does size optimization
b) -Os sucks at size optimization
