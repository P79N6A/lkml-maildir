well,  being sick of the number of times one has to upgrade the browser
for exploits,  I addressed it in a different way.
I ran firefox setuid to a different (not my main user),  uid+gid,  gave
my main account that gid as a supplemental group,  and gave that uid
access to the X magic cookie.
...  which only changes the nature of any exploit that might occur - any
injected code would have to go via X to attack my main account.
