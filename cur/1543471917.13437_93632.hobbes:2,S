A mov (move) does not set any flags. The Intel NOP is 0x90. It is
really xchg eax, eax which means to swap the contents of eax and eax,
in fact doing nothing.
The problem is that it's a single byte instruction. If you have nicely
aligned instructions, obtaining data on longword aligned addresses,
fetching instructions on longword aligned addresses, the machine is
very happy and cache-line refills are transparent. However, if you
throw in a bye-size opcode, instruction fetches are no longer aligned
so the machine slows down. The trick is to find an instruction sequence
that does nothing, but maintains 4 byte alignment.
