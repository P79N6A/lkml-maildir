FWIW, I've switched to using the PCI subsystem vendor/device IDs for 
virtio which Rusty suggested.  I think this makes even more sense than 
using the main vendor/device ID since I do think that we only should use 
a single vendor/device ID for all virtio PCI devices and then 
differentiate based on the subsystem IDs.
