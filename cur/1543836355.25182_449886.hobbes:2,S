If you want to stick with the current kernel module interface, I don't
see why you even need to bring this up, there are no arguments about

Don't you feel it's a bit early to "commit" to anything yet when we

one of the main reasons Linux is so successful.

I really don't want to follow the discussion unless necessary.  I trust
Chris and Rusty to do the right thing in this area...
