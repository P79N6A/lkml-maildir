Well, the unlazy/sync happen in any case later when we switch (given 
TS_USEDFPU set). We'd avoid a copy of it given the above conditions true. 
Wouldn't it makes sense to carry over only the status word and the control 
bits eventually?
Also, if the caller saves the whole context, and if we're scheduled while 
inside a system call (not totally unfrequent case), can't we implement a 
smarter unlazy_fpu that avoids fxsave during schedule-out and frstor after 
schedule-in (do not do stts on this condition, so the newly scheduled 
task don't get a fault at all)? If the above conditions are true (no need 
context-copy for new head in async_exec), this should be possible too.
