Hi all,
I have a legacy PCI fiber card running under Red Hat Linux 7.3, and I have
all the source code of its driver developped by others. Please see the
attachment.
http://www.nabble.com/user-files/135/cyport71.tar
 cyport71.tar 
It is working fine right now. But I am going to upgrade my OS to Rea Hat
Enterprise Linux AS 4, I am not sure how can I recompile and install this
fiber card in the new OS.  I am new to Linux and have minimal experience in
programming Linux. But this card is very important to me.
Any suggestion is highly appreciated!!  Thanks!!
Mason
