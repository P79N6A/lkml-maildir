There are a couple interesting things I would do here.
1) The tty "flip" buffer stuff was changed in 2.6.16+.
Maybe you could try going downwards to 2.6.15 or below and see if the
problem
still exists.
Then try going up to 2.6.19, I believe there were some bugs fixed
in 2.6.17/18/19, not sure how many of those made it backported into
2.6.16.25.
2) Try using Digi's "Out-Of-Kernel-Source-Tree"/GPL version of the
driver.
You can grab the latest and greatest beta version of it from here:
ftp://ftp1.digi.com/support/beta/linux/dgnc/
Its in source rpm format, let me know if you need it in a tarball format
instead.
You obviously will have to add in your specific PCI id into the driver,
but that should be a problem.
3) I seem to recall that someone mentioned that the Exar 17D154 PCI
chips were
easily "pushed" into the 8250 driver.
It might be interesting to try that route as well.
