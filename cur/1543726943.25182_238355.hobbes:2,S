I ran tiobench on this patch and here is the comparison:
Kernel		Seqread		Randread	Seqwrite	Randwrite
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.6.7		410.33		234.15		254.39		189.36
rwlocks-viro	401.84		232.69		254.09		194.62
refcount (kref)	455.72		281.75		272.87		230.10
All of this was 2.6.7 based.  Nos are througput rates in mega bytes per sec.
Test was on ramfs, 48 threads doing 100 MB of io per thread averaged over
8 runs.  This was on a 4 way PIII xeon. 
Thanks,
Kiran
