I can only agree!
I sleep near a 4-disk-box, and it would be nice if i could spin down the
disks at night...:-)
At the times of 2.0.xy, i also played around with the
"scsi-idle"-package and it worked quite well...but i noticed one effect:
Since i used it the first time, one of my disks spinned down
randomly....it stayed then still for about 10secs and started again...it
had no effect on the system (not even a logentry), but it costed me a
CD-R one time, and so i stopped using "scsi-idle".
I dont know if this was disk-dependant (the disk died some weeks ago
after working for about 3 years, it could have been defect), but it
started after the first use of "scsi-idle"...
But i would be glad to test a new version of "scsi-idle", if you write
one...:-)
Solong..
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
