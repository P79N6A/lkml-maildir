Good for you.  And arj beat pkzip for years, no a number of metrics.  I 
honestly do not care.

I mean that the -9 version of gzip does not take any more time to decompress 
than the -1 version does, it only affects how many matches are checked in the 
dictionary before it stops looking for a shorter match.  During decompression 
the offsets are all stored, it doesn't matter how they were calculated.
That's where I got the "interesting idea" that the -9 option to the gzip 
compressor does not add anything to the decompression time.

Interesting.  So you're suggesting that your algorithm is optimized for a 
processor with no L1 or L2 cache whatsoever?  Or are you suggesting that an 
algorithm that takes upwards of 3 seconds on a system that maxed out at 16 
mhz and had a 16 bit data path, a system with a maximum memory throughput 
slower than modern low-end hard drives (16mhz*2 bytes is 32 megabyts per 
second, and half for read and half for write is 16 megabytes per second when 
copying data without actually PROCESSING any of it, and this glosses over the 
fact that with no instruction cache you'll never see even close to that 
theoretical throughput on any code snippet longer than "rep movsw")...  That 
this algorithm is slow enough to be a legitimate optimization target and 
worth using closed source software to optimize this bottleneck.
Are you really suggesting that gzip isn't fast enough?  (Out of morbid 
curiosity, how long did it take the bios code to boot up this straw man to 
the point where it loaded the boot sector?)

No comment.

No, I posted a link to code.  And I offered to use that code to update an 
existing kernel patch if I could track it down, which I did.  (And I'm 
working on a 2.6 port with the new engine, albeit not at a particularly high 
priority seeing as we're in the middle of a code freeze...)
You're welcome to code up your own patch to do whatever you darn well please.  
I'm not interested.

You suggested I spend my free time to code up a patch to support a closed 
source compressor I'd never heard of.  I've taken it under advisement, and 
filed it appropriately.

Good for you.  Code up a patch, so I can start ignoring code instead of just 
ignoring suggestions.

I presume you're using the editorial "we".  Because I, myself, find the 
qualifier "for this matter" to be superfluous.

If some people code up a patch, then the matter moves out of the realm of pure 
philosophical arguments.

Really?  Wow.
