   For 1 to 8 CPUs I used the test script
   to send a fixed number of packets to a single destination address.
   The results show that time needed for lookup continuously increases
   for 2.5.3 wherease for rt_rcu-2.5.3, it remains constant.
How does it perform for a write-heavy workload such
as a massive route flap?
Both are equally important.
Also, workload for single destination isn't all that interesting
since such a workload isn't all that common except in benchmarking.
