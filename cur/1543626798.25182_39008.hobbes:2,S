While playing the game Doom Legacy (v1.32beta4), the sound suddenly quit 
on me.  After exiting the game I found these entries in my system log:
Apr  6 22:54:58 mercury kernel: cs46xx: powerdown DAC failed
Apr  6 22:54:58 mercury kernel: cs46xx: cs_release_mixdev() powerdown DAC 
failure (0x1)
My kernel:
Linux version 2.4.18 (root@mercury.snydernet.lan) (gcc version 2.96 
20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-98)) #1 SMP Mon Feb 25 19:45:39 EST 2002
This is with a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz sound card.  The card is 
apparently not sharing an IRQ with any other devices.
Is this a problem that can somehow be worked around by a lowly end user?
Thanks.
