Hi,
Here are 3 small fixes for 2.6.0-test9.  They fix a problem on Alphas on
boot time, remove some compiler warnings in some I2C drivers, and
disable a USB driver when building for SMP as the locking in it is all
messed up right now.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
