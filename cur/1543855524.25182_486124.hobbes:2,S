If you anyway have to patch your kernel, you can as well patch the 
complete driver into the kernel.
Three years after 2.6.0 the in-kernel driver is still marked as BROKEN, 
and e.g. the current Video4Linux API change might leave this driver 
unfixed and even more broken.
Is anyone working on getting this driver into shape NOW?
If not, it will still be at any time possible to submit a fixed version 
of this driver for re-inclusion.
