People may remember Linus saying a resolute no to SMP
support in Linux ;)
In my experience, when Linus says "NO" to a certain
idea, he's usually objecting to bad design decisions
in the proposed implementation of the idea and the
lack of a nice alternative solution ...
... but as soon as a clean, efficient and maintainable
alternative to the original bad idea surfaces, it seems
to be quite easy to convince Linus to include it.
cheers,
Rik
