Hello all,
	Ever since I had a hard disk die on me I have had a terrible time
trying to get modules to work.  I wrote to the list earlier and it was
suggested to try depmod -a.  Result:  nothing - just returns me to the
command prompt:
growler:~# depmod -a 
growler:~# 
It was also suggested that I try loading the modules manually to see
what the results are:
growler:~# insmod /lib/modules/2.2.0-pre7/ipv4/ip_masq_ftp.o 
Address   Symbol                            Defined by
growler:~# 
Nothing else.  Nothing in syslog or dmesg.  At boot I get a message
saying something like:
ip_masq_ftp.o: no such file or directory.  Yet the modules really are in
the right directory.  I may have lost something when my drive died but I
can't figure out what that may be.  This is on 2.2.0-pre7 with all the
necessary updates.  Any ideas what is wrong here?
