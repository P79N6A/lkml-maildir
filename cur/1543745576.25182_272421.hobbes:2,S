No one that I know of.  I had a thought in the back of my head of tackling ioctl 
documentation after I went through the stuff that's already in Documentation, but 
I figured I had enough to chew on for right now.
I'd probably make a subdirectory - i. e. Documentation/ioctl/hdio.txt - to 
differentiate it from other documents, and make it easier to get maintainers to 
put some stuff in there. ;)   AFAICT, there is next to no documentation on ioctl's 
anywhere in the kernel tarball.
