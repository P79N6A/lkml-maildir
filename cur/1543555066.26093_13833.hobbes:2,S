Hmm.... And that's without trying to be small.
I have one that loads a second kernel over the network using dhcp 
to configure it's interface and tftp to fetch the image and boots
that is only 20kb uncompressed....
Compressed I can fit that and a kernel all in plus a minimal
BIOS all in 512K with some room to spare...
