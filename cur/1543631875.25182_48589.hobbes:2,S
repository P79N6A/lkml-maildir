I finally got round to trying the patches out and --
unfortunately, things got even worse. While before the machine would
oops (still allowing one to ssh in and reboot) under heavy loads, now
it doesn't bother to log the slightest notice that something might
have broken, and freezes entirely (it can be pinged, though).
I can't say I like these fixes much.
