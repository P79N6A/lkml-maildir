No need to reboot it.  Simply flush the neighbor cache.
Scott root # ip neigh flush help
Usage: ip neigh { add | del | change | replace } { ADDR [ lladdr LLADDR ]
          [ nud { permanent | noarp | stale | reachable } ]
          | proxy ADDR } [ dev DEV ]
       ip neigh {show|flush} [ to PREFIX ] [ dev DEV ] [ nud STATE ]
