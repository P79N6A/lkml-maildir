hi,
i noticed *lots* of the following messages in my system log:
prinz rpc.statd[455]: recv_rply: can't decode RPC message!
prinz rpc.statd[455]: recv_rply: can't decode RPC message!
prinz rpc.statd[455]: recv_rply: can't decode RPC message!
prinz rpc.statd[455]: recv_rply: can't decode RPC message!
(yes, and so on). it's not flooding the log, but constantly filling it up.
this client is running Debian GNU/Linux (unstable) on i386.
nfs-common and nfs-kernel-server is both 1.0.6-1
(server is Debian GNU/Linux (unstable) on ppc32, not any busier than 
before. kernel on the server is 2.4.23)
i noticed the messages on the client firtst with 2.6.0-test11, they did 
not occur on any former kernelversions. however, the changelog to 
-test11 does not reveal any nfs-related changes.
nfs-utils-1.0.6.orig/utils/statd/rmtcall.c  says at line 227:
if (!xdr_replymsg(xdrs, &mesg)) {
                 note(N_WARNING, "recv_rply: can't decode RPC message!\n");
                 goto done;
         }
any hints?
Thank you,
Christian.
