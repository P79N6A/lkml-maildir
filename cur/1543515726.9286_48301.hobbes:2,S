Your assumption holds on ARM and PA-RISC.  They both take their arguments
in registers.  Take a look in include/asm-*/unistd.h, this is where
the architecture defines how to make a system call.  On the Alpha,
for example, it casts all arguments to long first, so I'm guessing your
assumption is true there too.
