This can race with hold_freezer_for_task() calling thaw_process. Earlier
thaw_process(p) was called only after the process 'p' was frozen.
Now with hold_freezer_for_task(), we can as well call thaw_process(p)
when 'p' is in the freezing stage. Hence the task_lock.
I know it's ugly, but couldn't think of any other alternative at that time.

Yes. If more than one tasks want another task to be temporarily thawed, this
won't work. I hadn't anticipated such a case.

So can't we in that case find out the weight of the freeze_event variable and
subtract that weight from the count (if the count is <=0 ) ?

Thanks for the review.
