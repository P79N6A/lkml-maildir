Subject: [PATCH] Fix non-TSC guest clocksource lockup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

lguest uses a host-supplied wallclock-based clocksource when the TSC
is not reliable.  As this is already in nanoseconds, I naively used a
multiplier of 1 and a shift of 0.
But update_wall_time() in its infinite wisdom decides to adjust the
clock a little (where does it think it's getting a more accurate time
from?)
It will happily tweak the multiplier... to 0, then -1.
So the "fix" is to use a shift of 22 like everyone else, and a
multiplier of 1 << 22.
