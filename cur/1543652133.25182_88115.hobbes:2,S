Subject: 2.5.46 scsi (aic7xxx?) reboot failure & kernel panic

Since a couple of releases ago my box fails to reboot, spitting out 
scsi related errors and a kernel panic instead. At first I tought 
this to be the double driver registration issue, but since the 
latest kernel still has this problem...
This is 2.5.46 smp on a box with 2 scsi drivers like so:
 CONFIG_SCSI=y
 CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y
 CONFIG_SCSI_AHA152X=y
 CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX=y
 CONFIG_AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE=8
 CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY_MS=5000
The messages look like this (scsi0 is the aic7xxx):
 Rebooting.
