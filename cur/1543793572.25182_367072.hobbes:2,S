There was a discussion weeks (or already months?) ago about this. The
ndiswrapper maintainer had no problem with private stacks for the NDIS
drivers but IIRC there where some issues with callbacks from the NDIS
drivers which led to the conclusion that it's way too much of a hassle
to get it working and stable.
And yes, you need ndiswrapper for almost all of the WLAN drivers since
there is no documentation of them.
