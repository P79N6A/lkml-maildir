You stand accused of crimes against whitespace.
- The patch uses eight-spaces everywhere.  Please use eight-stop tabs.
- Funny comment format:
/*we want to be careful what we write we are in clustered mode
 *if the mask came from pending_irq_balance_apicid we are ok because
 *it was generated with cpu_to_logical_apicid*/
 should be
/*
 * We want to be careful what we write we are in clustered mode if the mask
 * came from pending_irq_balance_apicid we are ok because it was generated
 * with cpu_to_logical_apicid.
 */
- 1e16-column xterms.  Please aim for 80-columns:
static inline void io_apic_write_affinity(unsigned int apic, unsigned int reg,  unsigned int mask, unsigned int irq)
  should be:
static inline void io_apic_write_affinity(unsigned int apic,
		unsigned int reg,  unsigned int mask, unsigned int irq)
  or
static inline void
io_apic_write_affinity(unsigned int apic, unsigned int reg,
			unsigned int mask, unsigned int irq)
- non-K&R braces:
       if ((pending_irq_balance_apicid[irq] == mask) || (irqbalance_disabled))
       {
               mask = mask << 24;
               io_apic_write(apic,reg,mask);
       }
       else
       {
               printk ("Trying to write abartry affinity value to ioapic! Not allowed!");
       }
}
  should be:
       if ((pending_irq_balance_apicid[irq] == mask) || irqbalance_disabled) {
               mask = mask << 24;
               io_apic_write(apic,reg,mask);
       } else {
               printk("Trying to write abartry affinity value to ioapic! Not allowed!");
       }
  (note: no space between "printk" and "(")
  (s/abartry/arbitrary/)
  (best replace that printk with a BUG() or a WARN_ON(1))
  (or split the string up so it fits in 80-cols)
- Funny comments:
	/*only the first 8 bits are valid*/
  should be:
	/* Only the first 8 bits are valid */
Could you please take a look at all that and resend?
Thanks.
