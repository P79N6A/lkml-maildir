I agree with Thomas on this one.  Maybe "timer" and "timeout" are too 
close, but I think they are the most descriptive names.
  - timeout is something used for a timeout.  Timeouts only actually
  expire infrequently, so they have a host of attributes associated
  with that characteristic.
  - timer is something used to time something.  They almost always
  expire as part of their normal behaviour.  In the ktimer code they
  have a host of attributes related to this characteristic.
Thomas answered the suggestion to use "process timer" as an alternative 
name, but I didn't see a reply after that from Roman (I may have missed it.)

This is rather vague.  It is rather easy to raise hypothetical
issues.  From what I've seen, Thomas has gone to great lengths to
address specific issues raised.  For example, he actually compiled
code on 4 different platforms to get the REAL size of the assembly
fragments, in order to address your concern about CONJECTURED size
problems.

Huh?  I thought Thomas' last answer was pretty clear.

No one minds poking deep.  But frankly, I find hypothetical arguments
to be less useful than reality-backed ones.  I would rather not hear
reasoning about a resolution issue - I'd like to numbers, if possible,
about the degradation of performance, if that's the issue.  If
it's confusion about the API, then maybe we just need clear statements
that "X API provides resolution at Y level (from one of: hardware, tick, 
something else).
