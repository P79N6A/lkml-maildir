Olaf,
Very accurate debugging. The SCSI mid level has several
scsi_init_malloc()s that use the GFP_DMA flag and don't bother to
check if NULL is returned. The GFP_DMA flag tells the allocator
that only memory below the 16MB limit is suitable (on i386).
This would be understandable if you had an ISA SCSI adapter in
your machine (which can only DMA to a 24 bit address space). Sad
to say the mid level uses that GFP_DMA flag irrespective of
whether an ISA SCSI adapter is about.
That "add-single-device" also would have required extra SCSI
command blocks to be allocated and that could have failed in
the same fashion. This latter problem causes oopses when
high level SCSI modules (eg sr_mod) are loaded.
I have just posted a proposal for a CONFIG_SCSI_NO_ISA switch
in the linux-scsi list that will address this problem
(except if you have one of those pesky ISA SCSI adapters).
