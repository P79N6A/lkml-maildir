Why does the kernel have to sanitize the input. Last time I checked
undefined inputs gave undefined outputs in the standards. fopen(NULL,
NULL) seems to crash glibc for example.
The kernel has to behave correctly given valid sensible inputs. Masking
the top bits is not behaving correctly
	"sleep ages"
	"no I'll sleep a short time"
Surely it would be far better to do
	if((timeout >> 31) >> 1) 
		return -EINVAL;
for 64bit systems
