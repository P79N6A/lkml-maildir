That predates lib/sha1.c by a while.

lib/sha1.c's footprint is... 621 bytes today. Huh. That's up from 466
bytes when it was introduced and no one's touched it:

Stupid compilers.
But anyway. Cache footprint matters. The two big users of SHA1 in the
kernel are /dev/random and IPSec, both of which typically operate on
small chunks of data.
