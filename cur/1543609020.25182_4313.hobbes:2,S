I've managed to reproduce the problem, and I heard from you elsewhere
that you've verified the fix (although it appeared to reduce the memory
savings to 4KB).
start_segment_treap() is a macro (operating largely on the same
principle as list_entry()) which converts a treap_node_t * to a struct *
given the field and struct name by computing offsets and casting. The
casting renders this somewhat less than type safe, and the patch below
corrects a type error I committed in calling it (the start_tree field
is already of type treap_node_t *).
Thanks again,
Bill
