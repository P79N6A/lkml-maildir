That inherently limits the image to half of available ram (you need
somewhere to store the snapshot), so you won't get the full image you
express interest in below.

You're describing uswsusp! (At least in so far as I understand it!).
You can't get a fully running system though, because if anything changes
something on disk that was snapshotted (super blocks etc) your snapshot
is invalid and you risk on-disk corruption.

Nooooooo! See above about disk corruption.

Please, go apply that logic elsewhere, then cut out (or at least stop
adding) support for users with less common needs in other areas. I fully
acknowledge that most users have only one place to store their image and
it's a swap device. But that doesn't mean one size fits all.
A full image implies that you need to figure out what's not going to
change while you're writing it and save that separately. At the moment,
I'm treating most of the LRU contents as that list. If we're going to
start trying to let every man and his dog run while we're trying to
snapshot the system, that's not going to work anymore - or the logic
will get a lot more complicated.
Sorry. I never thought I'd say this, but I think you're being naive
about how simple the process of snapshotting a system is.
