Can you measure spin up time for your 15k's?  Some controllers can't 
catch the first D2H FIS after POR and have to wait unconditionally for 
spin up for hotplug & resuming from suspend.  Currently 8 sec wait is 
used but it seems insufficient for your drives.  Failing to spinup in 
that 8 secs would probably result in timeout of the first reset attempt 
and retrial - which currently takes > 30 secs.
Spin-up time can be measured by first issuing STANDBY and then time how 
long IDLE IMMEDIATE takes, I think.
Thanks.
