In other words, its gnomeradio that needs fixed then?
Its the best 'radio' proggy I've run across that works with my 
hardware, but I'm not sure it has a support person at ths late date.  
Its probably not been touched in 2 years.  Kde doesn't appear to have 
a similar util that I've run across in the menu's so far, and its 
3.3.0 here.
All of which seems to be dancing around the real problem though.  
There seems to be no handy (to the user) path into the kernel to 
allow such a killing unconditionally function.  root should have that 
ability.

The logout took about 2 minutes because X couldn't clear itself 
either.

I'll try that next time.

But a problem the kernel really should be capable of handling 
transparently.

What on earth for?  I don't issue anything he would be interested in 
except the first part of my sig.  And thats been in my sig for a year 
or so, and will stay there till the so-called Patriot Act is 
repealed.  John Ashcroft has done more damage to democracy 
single-handedly because of his paranoia than any other 20 men in our 
history.  G. Washington certainly wouldn't have tolerated such a 
person in his 1st term of government.
Depending on the mailing list, data here has a lifetime as short as 30 
days.
Sorry about spilling politics into the list folks.
