Subject: [2.4 patch] pc300_drv.c: mark a function pointer as __devexit_p
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I got the following link error in 2.4.25-pre7 when trying to compile 
drivers/net/wan/pc300_drv.c statically into a kernel with 
CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n :
<--  snip  -->
...
        -o vmlinux
local symbol 0: discarded in section `.text.exit' from drivers/net/wan/wan.o
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The patch below fixes this issue by marking the function pointer with 
__devexit_p .
I also did the following changes to this struct:
- added indentation
- switched to C99 initializers
- removed two unneeded NULL's
Please apply
Adrian
