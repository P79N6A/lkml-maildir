I am now using 2.5.51 and I still have the problem when I reboot from a 2.5.51 
kernel to a 2.5.51 or 2.4.19 kernel both my internal keyboard and mouse (DELL 
Inspiron 8100) are not working anymore. The strange thing is the keyboard 
does work in grub.
relevant dmesg output:
	device class 'input': registering
	register interface 'mouse' with class 'input'
	mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
	register interface 'joystick' with class 'input'
	register interface 'event' with class 'input'
	input: PS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
	serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
	input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
	serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
thanks,
