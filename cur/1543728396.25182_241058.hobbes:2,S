As this is a production machine i haven't had the balls to move to
2.6.8-rc3. Instead, i took only the via-rhine.c from 2.6.8-rc4-mm1
applied your last patch to it and recompiled the module.
What should i say: It works! I wasn't able to trigger the error with
my standard test (copying a 680MB ISO image from/to Samba shares in
parallel). An this even with "large readwrite" enabled in smb.conf.
So, i consider this gone - for now :)
          (But perhaps you should update the drivers version number)
Thank you very much!
  Best regards,
    Peter
