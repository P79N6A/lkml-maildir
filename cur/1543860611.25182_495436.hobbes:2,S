"prtconf -pv" is what I'd ask the user to do on Sparc, or something
similar.
In over 10 years of the sparc port there's never been a situation
where "prtconf -pv" or similar did not get me the information I
needed. :-)
"prtconf" walks the device tree raw using /dev/openprom and
pretty prints it like I assume your ppc "lsprop" thing does.
