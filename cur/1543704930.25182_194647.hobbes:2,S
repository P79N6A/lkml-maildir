I just took a look at the autofs4 code and the BKL is explicitly held in 
the lookup code.   It is also implicitly held in the ioctl code.
My understanding is that when the dcache (and subsequently 
->d_revalidate) was introduced into the Linux kernel, autofs3 was 
modified to do revalidates, and would have had it's lock_kernel calls 
added then.  If autofs4 had forked off before the dcache addition, it 
wouldn't have picked the lock_kernel in d_revalidate.
Peter/Jeremy, could you confirm this?
