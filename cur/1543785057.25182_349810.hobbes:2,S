The syntax for that is one of the following:
# define STR(x) #x
# define XSTR(x) STR(x)
# define SOME_ARCH_DIR foo/bar
# define STRING_INCLUDE(path) XSTR(SOME_ARCH_DIR/path)
# define ANGLE_INCLUDE(path) <SOME_ARCH_DIR/path>
Then:
# include STRING_INCLUDE(baz.h)    ==>    # include "foo/bar/baz.h"
# include ANGLE_INCLUDE(baz.h)     ==>    # include <foo/bar/baz.h>
I'm not sure what GCC version these were first supported in, but I
would try to stay away from them as a matter of principle.  They're
ugly and quite hard to read/understand.  If there were no other way,
I might use those, but since there probably is...  I dunno about
you, but those are some really icky constructions.
Cheers,
