Ok, sounds like a good idea. But I think those who already use 
boolean-type can/should be changed. Just have to stop myself of 
converting "boolean" int's.

Do not agree on this thou. Of couse it is something to strive for, but 
_Bool is using the same boolean-logic as C always used:
0 is false, otherwise it is true
so blaming _Bool for using this seem a bit odd. Also, do you mean to 
approve changing the return-type of all the functions who returns a 
boolean but uses an integer?
