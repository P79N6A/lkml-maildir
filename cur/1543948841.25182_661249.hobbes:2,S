Jason, we're actually trying to reduce the usage of the stop_machine in 
general. It's a very big hammer that kills latencies and stuff. It'd be nice 
if we did not introduce any more dependencies on it. I guess in some case 
there is simply no other way to handle what need to do. But please think twice
(or more :)).
