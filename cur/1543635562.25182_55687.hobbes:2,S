Well, that's the aim.

The only thing that was mentioned yet was the amount of stuff that depends 
on periodic ticks. If we just tick unperiodically, we'd fail for sure, but 
if we make these instances depend on another timer - we won.
I think a good scheduler can handle this and should also be able to 
determine a halfaway optimal tick rate for the current load.
That's a _real_ challenge, guys!
