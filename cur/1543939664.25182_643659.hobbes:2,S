List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following is a series of patchsets related to Unionfs.  This is the
fifth set of patchsets resulting from an lkml review of the entire unionfs
code base, in preparation for a merge into mainline.  The most significant
changes here are a few locking related fixes, and a correction to broken
logic which didn't allow writing to the first available writable branch.
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on 2.6.24, MM, as well as the
backports to 2.6.{23,22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs, nfs2/3/4,
jffs2, ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  Also tested
with LTP-full and with a continuous parallel kernel compile (while forcing
cache flushing, manipulating lower branches, etc.).  See
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download back-ported unionfs code.
