Burp.
You're right.
The loop failure comes when user sends URG and more data _without_ FIN.
Then RDHUP is not set, and your loop will read up to before the URG
and no further.
(Normal behaviour would be to skip the URG segment and continue
reading data after it, or to include the URG segmenet if OOBINLINE is
set.)
