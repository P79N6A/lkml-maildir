Possibly I got a mail about that, but as I have a huge backlog, I didn't
read it. 
Possibly I have never heard about that and don't know anything particular about
it.
But in fact, improving something is generally good and if I have/get some
information about that, we could include it in gpm.

Sounds good, so you're the person wrinting the patch for gpm ;)
