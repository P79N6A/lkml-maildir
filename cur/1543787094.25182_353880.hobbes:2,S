I must be being particularly dense today ... but:
 pcp->high = batch / 2; 
Looks like half the batch size to me, not the same?

Mmmm. so every time we fork a process with 8K stacks, or allocate a frame
for jumbo ethernet, or NFS, you want to drain the lists? that seems to
wholly defeat the purpose.
Could you elaborate on what the benefits were from this change in the
first place? Some page colouring thing on ia64? It seems to have way more
downside than upside to me.
