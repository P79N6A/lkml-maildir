How does it keep the threading model simpler?  Is this an inter-module
dependency.

It seems like it would be cleaner for each module to have its own
workqueue if it needs one.  There's also schedule_work(), although
that goes to a multi-threaded workqueue.  Michael Tsirkin has
suggested creating a system-wide single-threaded workqueue (ie
something like schedule_ordered_work()) for everyone that occasionally
needs a single-threaded workqueue.
