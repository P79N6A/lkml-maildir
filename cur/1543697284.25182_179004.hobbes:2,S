Hello!
What does this do:
                printk(KERN_INFO "CPU: Processor revision %u.%u.%u.%u,
%u MHz\n",
                       (cpu_rev >> 24) & 0xff,
                       (cpu_rev >> 16) & 0xff,
                       (cpu_rev >> 8) & 0xff,
                       cpu_rev & 0xff,
                       cpu_freq);
(from arch/i386/kernel/cpu/transmeta.c)
Does not & 0xff make no sense? 0 & 1 makes 0, 1 & 1 makes 1, 
no changes.
And I don't understand why we do this for 8bit and shifting the
cpu_rev...
Can someone enlighten me (with CC' as I am not subscribed) ?
Nico
