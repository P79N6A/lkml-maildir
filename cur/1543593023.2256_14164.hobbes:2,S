then the user has branched into his own version, or at least that would be my
take on it.  Another possible method is to expire transactions by persons who
lack permission to keep them open indefinitely.  I suppose one could expire them
to abort, or expire them to commit, both being valid under some circumstances.

It is just a matter of time, and we will.  I think that the major release AFTER
2.6 will see it.  First we have to get a prototype done in time for 2.6....

don't know what a journal-type transaction is and how it differs from a database
transaction.
