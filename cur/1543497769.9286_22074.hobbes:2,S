Put it into the main kernel and make sys_sendfile() use it - it's *MUCH*
better than expanding the export list and duplicating code.

No. It uses a lot of code that is not SMP-safe. BTW, the same applies to
your sendfile-from-struct-file thing. Which is one of the reasons *not* to
drag it out of the main kernel - it would make analysis of SMP issues in
VFS and filesystems much harder.
