I've heard of 'transparent' or 'stackable' filesystems that let you
mount a set of filesystems on top of each other, and changes are made to
the top level filesystem.  (I think the BSDs might have (had) that...)
If you were to use something like that, the 'reserve' step would be
transparent to the user, but the 'commit' (to the lower layer fs) would
not be.  (Mount the lower layer in some other place as well and write to
it for your commit.)
You might want to consider that approach since I think you would find a
number of other people would have other uses for the same filesystem. 
(And thus you might get more help, and have a chance of getting it into
(one of) the standard kernel(s).)
Hmm... it just occurred to me... multisession CDs do something
similar... That might have some benefits for those who do multisession
cd mastering--and that gives you more potential contributors.
Just some thoughts...  have fun!
