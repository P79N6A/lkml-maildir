Better fold it into the (renamed and recommented) page_to_copy,
applying only to current.
The "use" of page_table_lock there is totally bogus.  Normally you
need down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem) to walk that vma chain; but
I'm guessing you have everything sufficiently frozen here that you
don't need that.
But if it is sufficiently frozen, I'm puzzled as to why pages mapped
into the current process are (potentially) unsafe, while those mapped
into others are safe.  If the current process can get back to messing
with its mapped pages, what if it maps a page you earlier judged safe?
