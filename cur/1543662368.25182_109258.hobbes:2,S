For the record:
    * The LSM code patches have always been publicly available for
      anonymous checkout via BK from 
http://lsm.immunix.org/
    * The LSM mailing list is managed by Mailman and is open for anyone
      to subscribe
      <
http://mail.wirex.com/mailman/listinfo/linux-security-module>,
      unsubscribe, or view the archives
      <
http://mail.wirex.com/pipermail/linux-security-module/>.
    * The LSM mailing list is also independently archived elsewhere
      <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-security-module&r=1&w=2>.
    * For the first year or so, the LSM mailing list was "closed" in
      that posts from non-subscribers were trapped for moderation. I
      always approved such posts if they were topical, and used the
      moderation only to filter spam.
    * Subsequent to that, I was told that this is "not the linux way"
      and the mailing list was made "open" so that anyone can post, and
      Spamassassin was installed to filter spam (which doesn't quite
      work perfectly
      <
http://mail.wirex.com/pipermail/linux-security-module/2002-October
:/3658.html>).
It has never, ever been "private" any more than any of the other 
subsystem -devel lists are "private."

A few days after I opened the list, it had 300 subscribers. Today it has 
607 subscribers. There have been 4183 posts.

To me, the most gratifying result to come out of OLS 2002 
<
http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2002/>
 (apart from Linus accepting the 
first patch :-) was the Ericsson project 
<
http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2002/view_txt.php?text=abstract&talk=44>.
 
What makes this project so impressive is that AFAIK Ericsson never asked 
the LSM mailing list a single question. They just took the documents and 
the code, and implemented their module. To me, *that* is evidence that 
the abstraction is usable: that an independent 3rd party can code to it 
without help.

And in fact we did seek input from Theodore Ts'o in the summer of 2001. 
Most of that guidance was verbal, and it happened 18 months ago, so my 
memory is imperfect, but I think he advised us to keep the invasiveness 
minimal, and to avoid adding features that were just there to support 
audit. Others at that lunch were Chris Wright (WireX) and Pete Loscocco 
(SELinux).
What I've learned from the LSM merge process is that we need to get 
piecewise buy-in from each major subsystem maintainer that will be 
impacted. For instance, the network hooks did not go in as smoothly as 
we would have liked. Thanks to hard work from James Morris and helpful 
feedback from David Miller, they did go in after substantial revisions. 
Next time, we will float a paper design past subsystem maintainers ahead 
of time.
