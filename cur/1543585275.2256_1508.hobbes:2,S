Actually, funnily enough, I see that the old thread-safe stuff is still
there in get_pte_kernel_slow(). The only thing that breaks it is that we
don't hold any locks, so it's only UP-safe, not SMP-safe.
However, it definitely looks like we should just un-inline that thing
completely, and make a lot of it architecture-independent anyway.
