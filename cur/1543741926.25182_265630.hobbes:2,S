One way to experiment with a user-mode ACPI interpreter would be to 
continue to use the kernel-mode interpreter for boot up , and cut over 
to the user-mode interpreter at /sbin/init.  The kernel-mode interpreter 
could be sent the way of free_initmem() which is called just before 
/sbin/init is invoked.
