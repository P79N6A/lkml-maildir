Sorry for the double send, but I messed up on the subject.  I'll
get used to mutt one of these days.
I think I've spotted a bug in the 8250 code, but I'm not really
sure.  I'm having a hard time understanding why the lsr_break_flag
is necessary.
Subject: Serial 8250: clear the lsr_break_flag at open
The lsr_break_flag in the 8250 driver is not cleared when the port is
opened.  This means that on a serial console, if a break has occurred
while the port is closed, the first call to receive_chars() will
result in a break being delivered at that point.  Clear the flag at
open to fix the problem.
