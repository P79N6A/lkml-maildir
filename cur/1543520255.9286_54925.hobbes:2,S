Hmm.  I'm traveling tomorrow, so I'll not have any time to really get
anywhere on trying to track this down, but using the trident driver is
not the only way to get a process stuck in __down in 2.3.34.  I now have
two instances of netscape stuck there.  Both were downloading simple HTML
pages when they got stuck (with gif and jpeg inlines, but nothing fancy).
Hope it proves at all helpful....
