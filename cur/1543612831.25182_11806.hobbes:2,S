I have somewhere a machine that used to work with such hardware, but
have never tested it with anything newer than 2.2.x kernel and have no
time to perform such tests in the near future (Maybe I'll find some after
Christmas).
AFAIR the hardware works fine with 386/486 with clock up to 66 MHz.
Faster machines have problems with BIOS initialization, probably due to
very slow EPROM chips or badly designed timing calculations in their
BIOSes. They *might* work with BIOS disabled/romoved, but all hardware I
have has the BIOS chips integrated.
Most hardwate supports drives up to 40 MB (I have only 20s) and the
transfer rates about 20-40 kB/s. Faster (with memory mapped I/O) boards
are not supported by the driver.
