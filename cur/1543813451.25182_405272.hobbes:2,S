Hi,
When I plug my iPod in via USB, and later eject it, I more often than
not get this:
usb 5-5: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 20
usb 5-5: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 20
usb 5-5: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 20
usb 5-5: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 20
usb 5-5: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 20
sd 14:0:0:0: scsi: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery
usb 5-5: USB disconnect, address 20
What's going on here?
A list of other problems that I've seen can be found on Carsten Otto's
site about his own iPod experiences, 
http://home.c-otto.de/ipod/...
On that page a link to a SuSE ML is linked to, blaming the choice of IO
scheduler, and recommends that people use cfq. I think this is bullshit,
but I am running anticipatory. Should I try cfq?
Thanks,
