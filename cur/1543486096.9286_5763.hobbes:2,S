Ah youth.  Ummm, how about the machine C was designed for (and around) in the
first place and the first place UNIX was written in C -- the PDP-11 (the
original UNIX was on the PDP-7 written in assembler, but when Dennis and Brian
and the gang moved up to 11's, they rewrote the OS into C)?  Also, before you
think 16-bit machines are completely dead, I did a GCC port for a new 16-bit
machine last year that will be used in the embedded space for audio processing
(and programmed in C).
