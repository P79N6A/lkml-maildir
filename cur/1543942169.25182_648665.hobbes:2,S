Indeed, at the end of the day iSCSI is a bloated cabling standard.  :)
It has its uses, but I don't see it as ever coming close to replacing 
direct-to-network (perhaps backed with local cachefs) filesystems... 
which is how all the hype comes across to me.
Cheap "Lintel" boxes everybody is familiar with _are_ the storage 
appliances.  Until mass-produced ATA and SCSI devices start shipping 
with ethernet connectors, anyway.
