Nope, it dies even with my handbuilt XFree86 4.0.1 DRI (Slack7.0) on 
plain KDE2.0.1. I have no extra patches in kernel and quite common HW 
[ Celeron 433, 192MB of RAM, 13GB HDD ( ext2 & vfat partitioned ),
PCI NE2000 NIC, ES1371 sound, Intel BX chipset board and ATI 
Radeon32DDR - maybe the new MTRR stuff is not working right ? ] At 
least it was running fine with test11 and with test11-ac4
