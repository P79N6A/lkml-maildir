Ok,
dm should be modified to support raid1 or raid5 or raidwhatever,
probably using code from md (included or as a module) and md 
should be modified to use dm for the request mapping work.
problem is that raid needs some way to keep state so wether we want to
keep it in md superblock on in LVM metadata we need to do this in kernel
space.
And i don't feel dm is the correct place for this, unless Joe has a
very elegant solution :)
