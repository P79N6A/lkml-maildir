That is incorrect.  This works perfectly on i386 and on ALL  
architectures supported by Linux.  A lot of places in the kernel  
already do this today (mostly hand coded though, eg XFS and NTFS)...
There even is such a function already in mm/ 
sparse.c::vaddr_in_vmalloc_area() with pretty identical content.  I  
would suggest either this new inline should go away completely and  
use the existing one and export it or the existing one should go away  
and the inline should be used.  It seems silly to have two functions  
with different names doing exactly the same thing!
Best regards,
