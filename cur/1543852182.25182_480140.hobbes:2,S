So...  what does this have to do with switching from mutex to semaphore?
Perhaps this works around the debugging code which gets offended if a mutex
is unlocked by a process which didn't do the lock?
If so, it's a bit sad to switch to semaphore just because of some errant
debugging code.  Perhaps it would be better to create a new
mutex_unlock_stfu() which suppresses the warning?

This is a functional change which isn't described in the changelog.  What's
happening here?
