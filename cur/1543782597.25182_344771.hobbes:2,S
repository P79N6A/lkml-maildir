I agree, seems a great idea to me (sulking because I was too dumb
to get it, even when Nick and Andi first posted their patches).
It won't just save on the copying at fork time, it'll save on
undoing it all again when the child mm is torn down for exec.
The refaulting will hurt the performance of something: let's
just hope that something doesn't turn out to be a show-stopper.
I see some flaws in the various patches posted, including Rik's.
Here's another version - doing it inside copy_page_range, so this
kind of vma special-casing is over in mm/ rather than kernel/.
No point in testing vm_file, the vm_flags cover the cases.
Test VM_MAYSHARE rather than VM_SHARED to include the never-can-be-
written MAP_SHARED cases too.  Must exclude VM_NONLINEAR, their ptes
are essential for defining the file offsets.  Must exclude VM_RESERVED,
faults on remap_pfn_range areas would usually put in anon zeroed pages
instead of the driver pages - or perhaps would be better as a test
against VM_IO, or vma->vm_ops->nopage?
Having to exclude the VM_NONLINEAR seems rather a shame, since those
are always shared and likely enormous.  The InfiniBand people's idea 
of a way for the app to set VM_DONTCOPY (to avoid rdma get_user_pages
problems) becomes attractive as a way for apps to speed their forks.
