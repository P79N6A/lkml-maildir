There should be no skbuff allocation outside net/core/skbuff.c and all
normal[1] networking drivers also don't use private pools. Perhaps
you forgot to instrument a case there.

[1] There may be a few unnormal ones that do; e.g. vendor driver
writers seem to frequently try to reuse skbuffs privately because they're
used to that from other OS. It is discouraged and somewhat tricky, but
possible.
