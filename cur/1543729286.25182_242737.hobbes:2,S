I just did a quick google search on "MODE SELECT" and "vendor" and
found the following documentation for an IBM DeskStar driver:
    
http://www.embeddedlogic.com/TH99/h/txt/1478.txt
    Page 0
    Vendor Unique Parameters
    UQE - Untagged Queuing Enable (1)
    DWD - Disable Write Disconnect (0)
    UAI - Unit Attention Inhibit (0)
    CPE - Concurrent Processing Enable (1)
    TCC - Thermal Compensation (0)
    DSN Disable Target Initiated Synchronous Negotiation (0)
    FRDD Format Degraded (1)
    DRD - Disable Read Disconnect (1)
Allowing a user who is only supposed to have write access to a raw
partition to disable read or write disconnect does not seem like such
a hot idea, so MODE SELECT should probably be disallowed unless
someone writes a verify function that looks for safe bits in the
page.  
This could get a bit painful.
