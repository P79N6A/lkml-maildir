Well be more specific on the hardware.
Remember Promise came in and started dorking the driver.
Next they will not admit to an asic bug even thought I have called them on
the existance.  2.5 can not fix it, it will only blow up in 2.5.  Hell it
is possiblely blowing up in 2.4 but less likely.
So spell out the hardware in question.
The new chip hardware lost its interrupt parse because promise took it out
of the pci space and it made the driver less stable because the hardware
is less stable.
