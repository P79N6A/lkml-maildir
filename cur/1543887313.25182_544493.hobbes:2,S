I don't know. I tried to contact him a few weeks ago but failed.
Guess, maybe he isn't reading the @thunk.org email anymore which was
reference in the e2fsprogs source I used.
Ted,
from ext2_fs.h I learn that the value 0x0020 is left unused.
#define EXT2_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_META_BG           0x0010
#define EXT3_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_EXTENTS           0x0040
#define EXT4_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_64BIT             0x0080
Is this intentionally?
Cheers,
Jan
