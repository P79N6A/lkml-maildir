Just an idea:
Could a new, unrunnable process be created to "hold" the image?
<hand-wave>
Use a hypothetical sys_kexec() to:
1. create an empty process.
2. copy the kernel image and parameters into the processes' address
space.
3. put the process to sleep.
</hand-wave>
If it's floating out there for weeks or years, the data could get paged
out and not wired down.  It would show up in ps, so you'd have at least
some visibility into the allocation.
Change your mind?  Kill the process.
It might be complicated (or unworkable) to handle the panic case
properly, but for the case where a fast reboot is requested by calling
sys_reboot(), one should be able to fault-in and read back the image
from the "kexec holder" process' address space, copying it to the final
destination as you go.
You might even be able to go the next step, and if the process were
crafted carefully, waking it and running it would trigger the "copyin,
quiesce, and go" behavior.
Just a thought.
