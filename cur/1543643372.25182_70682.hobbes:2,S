If you just want a quick workaround (not a real fix), you
can change in_atomic back to in_interrupt on line 933 of kernel/sched.c.
Robert Love has posted another patch for this, so you might want to
try that out.  Here is a link to that post:

You may need to change KERN_ERROR to KERN_ERR in that patch.
