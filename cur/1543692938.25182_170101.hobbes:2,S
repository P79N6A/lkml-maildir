OK, Im trying to run 2.6.0-test6 on top of RH9.
I have progress in some areas but not others.
NETWORKING. is a nogo.
If I compile the driver 3c59x as a module, it gets loaded, but
with the driver in the kernel or as a module, I get the messages
in the messages file (during boot) or when I do a ./network start
from /etc/rc.d/init.d
