The problem is that the netif_wake_queue() 2.4 compatibility macro that
was recently added to 2.2 was wrong. It should do a mark_bh(). 8139too
uses the 2.4 macros, and therefore the netbh was always scheduled for too
late and performance was bad.
This patch should fix all drivers that use the new framework.
