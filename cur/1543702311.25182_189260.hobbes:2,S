I'm the "Gene", Rusty.  What symptoms would I see if its wrong?  
Memory leak?  Instability?  My dog falls over before his time?  My 
pickup throws a rod?
In my case, its only running a small 4 tape Seagate changer, so it 
doesn't get a lot of exersize other than by amanda's nightly run.

I noticed, gawd, that looks like a bowl of spagetti and I'm nowhere 
near the coder you fellows are.  But it did get rid of the compiler 
warnings about check_region().
