AFAICT , the kernel does not accept(*) any APM_EVENT until all userspace
"listeners" say it is OK. So until apmd doesn't reply, the kernel does
not accept the SUSPEND. If apmd says OK, kernel says OK to BIOS and SUSPEND
is activated, but if apmd says NO-NO, then the kernel rejects the SUSPEND
request and "nothing happens"
This is of course with a proper implementation of REJECT functionality
in the kernel apm driver. I don't know if it behaves like this in the
current IOC_AOM_REJECT version, but  it should :-)
* - by accept I mean : it receives a notification from BIOS and replies
OK to the BIOS. the BIOS doesn't change the powerstate until the kernel
responds with OK , IIRC
