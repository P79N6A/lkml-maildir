Making MODULE_PARM work when compiled in will be nice, but I see two
flaws right off:
* passing multiple module parms is wasteful, because the module prefix
must be repeated for each argument.  That strains cmdline limits (80
chars in boot environments)  IMHO we can do better than that.
* There are cases where you do not want MODULE_PARM options appearing as
__setup, just like there are cases where options passed to __setup do
not belong as a MODULE_PARM.  You should not unconditionally make
MODULE_PARM available on the kernel command line, even though that is
the simple solution.
