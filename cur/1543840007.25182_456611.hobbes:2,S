The 32-bit pointer issue can easily be resolved. I don't understand
what you mean with breaking the GDT though - to me it looks like the
entry for CS in entry64.S is broken without my patch. You reload the
GDT to a new one anyway in entry64-32.S so I'm not sure what this
32-bit breakage is that you are talking about.

Getting the fix in the kernel is hopefully solved now, thanks for the
help. Next step in my mind is to fix up kexec-tools - I'll send an
updated patch to fastboot later on today.
Thanks,
