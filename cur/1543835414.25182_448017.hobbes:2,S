Thanks.

sure I can do away with the pmd++ pud++ in the for loops.

When the pud is already set there a 2 options.  
1. You need to initialize pmds at the start of the pmd_page. 
2. You need to initialize pmds starting at some offset of the pmd_page.
When calling phys_pmd_init you need to pass it the start of the pmd_page
not some random pmd with in the page.  
pmd = alloc_low_page(&map, &pmd_phys); 
always gives us the start of the pmd_page.  I keep this idea for the
update path as well. 
pmd_offset(pud,0) does just this. Maybe there is a better macro to use?
Things could be different is terms of flexibility of what you pass in
(more changes are involved) but this set of changes seemed to be min-
tampering of the current code. 
Also in general is there some reason kernel mapping code is arch
specific?  This all seems to be pretty generic.
Thanks,
