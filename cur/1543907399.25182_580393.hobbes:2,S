What "kernel derived work" would that be?
All he distributes is the binary blob and the source code to his driver. He
hasn't given sufficient information to establish that either of those is a
"kernel derived work". It's certainly possibly that they might be and
sensible to caution him that he's breaking the rules if they are, but you
can't establish that he's not following the GPL.
Of course, he would have a definitely problem if he, or anyone else,
distributed the resulting binary.
