Ok.  I've spent some time looking at this and I think my fix is correct
if we assume that the intent of the change in the patch below is correct:
	gregkh-pci-pci-assign-unassigned-resources.patch
This patch adds a call to pci_assign_unassigned_resources() to
pcibios_init().  pcibios_init() is called unconditionally as a
subsys_initcall() from arch/i386/pci/common.c which is an unconditional
link for i386.

        if ((pci_probe & PCI_BIOS_SORT) && !(pci_probe & PCI_NO_SORT))
                pcibios_sort();
 #endif
+       pci_assign_unassigned_resources();
        return 0;
 }
I am not a PCI guru so I can't comment on whether this call is
reasonable, but if it is then we require setup-bus.o for all i386 platforms.
I will note that in reading the patch the commentry at the top lists
three individual changes which I think I can identify in the patch
itself, I don't feel that the change above falls under any of them?
Ivan, can you shead any light on whether the hunk of your patch above is
one of the three fixes, whether its a fourth fix, and indeed whether its
needed?
