> Alan, can you please give me pointers on the tty changes since 2.6.12?
The newest kernels have a replacement set of tty receive functions that
use a new buffering system.
http://kerneltrap.org/node/5473
covers the changes briefly. The internals of the buffering changes are
quite complex because Paul did some rather neat things with SMP locking
but the API is nice and simple.
Its fairly easy to express the old API in terms of the new one if you
are doing compat wrappers as well
