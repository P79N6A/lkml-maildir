See my discussion with David regarding LKM_LOCAL to see how the dlm still
comes into play, even when you have few disk structures to ping on. A
cluster file system is more than just sane disk design :)
Other things come into play there too, like how resources masters are
determined, whether they can be migrated etc. These can have an effect even
when you're doing work mostly within your own area of disk.
