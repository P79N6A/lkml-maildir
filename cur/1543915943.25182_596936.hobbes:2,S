And very little argument that the man page could be improved, perhaps. 
However, there is no question that pivot_root is intended to have

Keeping this functionality sounds a little like putting a bow tie and

legitimate purposes, but it doesn't make them safe. It appears to be a 
sort-of way to get per-process bind mounts.
