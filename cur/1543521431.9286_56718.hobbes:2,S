Hi There!
We have a problem in 2.2.x with the way the device->hard_header 
function is called.  In many places in the kernel its return value is 
not checked.  This means that in the Sangoma drivers when an 
incompatible frame type is transmitted the hard_header function 
returns 0, sets skb->protocol to zero, and discards the  packet down 
in the hard_header_xmit routine AFTER sending the packet throught the 
device transmit queue.  If the return value was checked from calls to 
the hard_header routine, the packet could be immediately discarded 
instead of wasting time and CPU cycles feeding it throught the device 
transmit queues.
The place where this return value is not checked that come to mind are 
in the IPv4 ARP code, IPv6 ARP and Multicast code, and maybe IPX.
Thoughts?  
I would like to see this cleaned up in 2.2.x and 2.3.x.
Cheers,
Matthew Grant
