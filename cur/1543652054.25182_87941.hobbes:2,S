Maybe not related, but I see 5 second "pauses" on a RAID-0+1 (software
RAID, Seagate 80G disks, Promise Ultra66+Ultra133 controllers, dual x86)
file server here.
I suspected NFS problems (looks like someone re-wrote NFS between 2.4.18
and 2.4.20-rc1) - but this is *not* the case.  The pauses happen on
locally running processes as well.
It seems to correlate well with a remote host delivering a mail (using
maildir over NFS) - but this is not the only situation in which it
happens.
Everything using disk, both on NFS clients and locally running
processes, just pause. Five seconds after everything is like it never
happened.
Nothing in dmesg.
Didn't happen in 2.4.18, happens in 2.4.20-rc1.
