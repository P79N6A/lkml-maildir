the sys call table is not un-exported for license-political reasons.
It's unexported because there is no correct use for it and that it can't
be used correctly either. Tell me which lock your module uses to protect
modifications to it? Tell me how you handle other modules trying to
overload the same syscall and those modules loading before your module but
then unloading while yours is still loaded?
It's the wrong mechanism to do ANYTHING. Really.
