Then just use -1UL as the arg to scnprintf, if you don't have a real
number.  That way the overflow will at least have a chance of detection
in the sysfs code, which I think it should check in
file.c:fill_read_buffer().  Greg?

That's sysfs' problem, not yours, and it handles it fine AFAICT.

Yes.  Don't do that.

Yes, that field should be removed.
Above all, by placing your questions inside a patch, you got results,
but please don't do this again.
Thanks,
Rusty.
