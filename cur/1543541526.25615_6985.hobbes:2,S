	Shouldn't or doesn't? I can tell you what the current problems
_are_.
	a) in a _lot_ of places we are required to distinguish between
directories and non-directories and yes, a lot of things in userland
depend on that.
	b) unlink() on such beasts. Welcome to fun. And no, it's not
rmdir() - here we are removing non-empty object.
	c) rename() of normal file to such animal and vice versa.
	d) rename() of directory <<--->>
	e) propagation of chmod() results
	f) _if_ we do unlink() - what should happen with
delete-upon-the-last-iput() semantics?
That's more or less it. Oh, and have fun with link(2) if some filesystems
that have forks support it. If you've got a way to handle multiple links
to object that has children - I'll be glad to hear it.
Care to give semantics for operations in the list above?
