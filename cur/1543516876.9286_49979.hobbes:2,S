Hi,
This model is not listed under "supported or known to work" on cdrecord's
page but it is not listed under "unsupported" so I assume that it works
absolutely fine under Linux.
But if some kind soul reads this message and knows the above assumption to
be false, please tell me so.
Thank you for your patience,
Tigran.
