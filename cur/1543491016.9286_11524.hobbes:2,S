Hi All,
My system consistently crashes while accessing the CD-ROM.  The crash
is a "hard-crash", no messages are displayed to the console and no
keyboard input is accepted after the crash.  SysRq does not respond
nor does Cntl-Alt-Del.  Only recovery is to power cycle the machine.
I've tried all recent 2.2.X kernels as well as 2.0.36 and the
problem repeats in all situations.
The crash occurs at boot, 50-70% of the time, during the driver
initialization.  Otherwise, the machine will crash whenever I access
the CD-ROM once booted.  I also boot and use NT; the system is
stable in NT and I have had no problems with the SCSI subsystem or
CD-ROM while running in NT.  Since it works with NT, can hardware
problems be eliminated?
I recently upgraded my system.  My original configuration was a motherboard
with an on-board Adaptec AIC-7880.  I upgraded to a motherboard w/o on-board
SCSI and purchased the BT-950 host adaptor to provide a SCSI interface.  In my
original system configuration, I had no problems related to the SCSI subsystem.
(The change in hardware occured due to a cache problem on the old motherboard).
I have been using the CD-ROM successfully with Linux for several monthes now,
the problems only started once I bought the BusLogic controller.
The following is the boot messages that appear when my system is booting.  I've
only provided the section relevant to the SCSI subsystem, I can provide the messages
in full if necessary.  I've annotated the information below with two notes.

I've tried changing the BIOS settings on the SCSI card, but the problem
persists.  From the above boot log, you can see that my final attempt was
to have the CDROM accessed asychronously.
Please let me know what additional information I can provide.
I know C, but haven't really played around in the kernel, but I'm willing to
learn to help find this problem if someone would be helpful enough to guide me
in the right direction ... I'll keep an eye on the kernel archives, but
I'd appreciate it if you would CC me on any replies.
Thanks in advance,
Eric Sorton <eric@db.erau.edu>
