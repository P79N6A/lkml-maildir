	I may be wrong on this but I believe that is why the BSD
compression routines can only be built as loadable modules.  They
can not be configured and compiled hard-linked into the kernel.
That was suppose to be deemed sufficient to satisfy the requirements
of the GPL.  I don't believe there is any problem with distributing
non-GPL files with GPL files in agregates, you just can't compile and
link them into one binary.
