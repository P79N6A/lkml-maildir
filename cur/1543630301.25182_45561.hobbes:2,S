It makes it more legible.

Well, yes and no. 
A short, pertinent _overview_ of the changelog in front of a more
detailed changelog is a nice thing to have. I love Alan Cox' changelog
style, I don't even bother with the 2.4.x-format anymore. It takes ages
due to ugly formating and it's way too detailed. (I asked the people at
our LUG meeting once, they all agreed with my above assessment).
Regs,
Sven
