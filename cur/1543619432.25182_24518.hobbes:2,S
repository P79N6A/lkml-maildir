I have to say no. I have been to busy cleaning up the fbdev layer right
now. What I have done is work on a way to haev each console device have
its own lock and then share that with struct tty_driver to protect
hardware access. This is just the first step. I knew the tty layer would
require more than just that. Since I haven't had time to look at all the
details I'm curious to what you have discovered. I still believe that
locking could be moved to the upper layer tho. I don't see why not.
