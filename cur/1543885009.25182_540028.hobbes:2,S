Does this mean you're NAK'ing this patch in favor of a userspace fix? My
perspective is that if someone explicitly requests sec=none, then we ought
to do an anonymous mount regardless of how the username is set. Would
you agree that that behavior is what you would want?

Definitely, though that sounds like a big project and I don't have the time to
tackle it at the moment :-)
