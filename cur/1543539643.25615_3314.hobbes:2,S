I am really starting to empathize with Andre here.  He's talking safety,
you guys preach security; he says via the kernel API, you say there is 
still RAW_IO.  The problem is that these commands are VENDOR SPECIFIC,
outside the ATA-ATAPI specs and undocumented/not publicly available.  As
such you don't KNOW if you're sending disktobrick to the drive or not.
What Andre wants to do is limit the kernel API to the ATA-ATAPI specs so
this cannot happen in normal/development use.  If you're worried about
losing the ability to FLASH your firmware, just use an SUID root userland
program which writes via RAW-IO.  At least in this way the program will
know what these commands are and use them in the proper context; not frying
your hardware when testing a new driver for robustness ie. properly
returning -ENOTATA instead.
just my $.02 cents worth - seems everybody else got there's. :)
