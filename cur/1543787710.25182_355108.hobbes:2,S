If X allowed to disconnect an app from the server and re-connect it again
(and it seems there's people in X.org looking into things like this since
its neccesary for people using X's networkin through wireless connections)
it'd be easier to support it.
Some operative systems already have something like this and call
it "process checkpointing": "Checkpointing allows you to freeze a copy of an
application, and then at a later time, it can be restored."

Desktops users would love it: Instead of "exiting" your desktop session,
just dump all your running apps to disk, restore them the next time
you start your desktop, just like you left. This is already doable with some
support from apps, but doesn't seem to be implemented in the real world :/
