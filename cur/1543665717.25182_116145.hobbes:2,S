That's a problem. Users do not have suspend partitions, but they do
have swap partition. And repartitioning existing installation is very
painfull. OTOH it is true that if we want
"emergency-suspend-to-disk-when-battery-low", dedicated partition
makes some sense.... ... Well. You can always do swapoff, swapon,
swsusp. Maybe some processes will die, but that's life ;-).
[But for that you'd have to guarantee that suspend always works, which
is hard, anyway.]

Well, I see it as advantage because I have swap space anyway (rarely
really used), so why not reuse it for swsusp?

:-). Well, comments were getting out of date because code was in
permanent flux. It makes sense to comment it now.

Well, IMO checklist like:
if you want to use swsusp you have to 
a) check swap is on persistent medium
b) make sure swap is at least as big as memory/2 [not really
neccessary, we might be lucky and swsusp with 30MB of swap...]
is easier for the user than repartitioning their harddrives. [I'd like
to see someone running swap on floppy ;-)]

I believe sys_reboot() is the right way to do
that. /sys/power/... needs sysfs mounted etc. /proc/acpi/sleep just
happened to already be there and be very convenient.

Actually "dedicated partition" vs. "swap partition" is quite a small
detail. It only affects disk allocation routines. Basic stuff like
"atomic copy" stays the same...

Do you think you can suspend with 90% memory kmalloc()-ed?
