that doesn't mean they're allowed to not honor the GPL of course.
Also it's almost the same argument as the ndiswrapper discussion: as
long as there is an alternative some of these companies (prolly not
ati/nvidia although: see [1]) will stay closed, but once there's no
alternative they'll just open up.
I can see the point of the argument that a change like this needs to be
announced for say 6 months first in that feature-removal doc though.
[1] Both nvidia and ati have a way out: they can do the IP side
(translating 3D stuff into card specific commands) in userspace and just
pass the data to the hardware via a thin driver that just drives and
controls the hardware. Sure it may be 5% slower, but it's a lot cleaner
IP wise. X after all is MIT (bsd like without nasty clauses) licensed
and allows binary components.
