Well, I found this problem during investigating an another MIPS
do_gettimeofday() bug which was fixed recently.  It was:
	lost = jiffies - wall_jiffies;
	...
	} else if (unlikely(lost))
		usecs += lost * tick_usec;
The tick_usec should not be used here since it is based on USER_HZ.
It is 'usecs += lost * (USECS_PER_SEC /HZ)' now.
I wondered why this bug really affects gettimeofday() always though
the 'lost' should usually be 0.  And finally I noticed the
jiffies/jiffies_64 optimization issue.
