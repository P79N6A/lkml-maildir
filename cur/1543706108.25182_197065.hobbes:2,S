Are there known issues with the Adaptec drivers on x86 systems?
Since upgrading to kernel 2.6.1, I get system lockups every few days to
a few weeks.
There are no messages, no warnings, not even debugging information.
The only thing I notice is that the SCSI bus appears to be hung, and the
system halts.  Sometimes the bus hangs before the system stops, but not
always.
Doesn't happen under any 2.4.x kernel, and I do not believe it happened
on the 2.6 betas I tried.
What would be the possible reasons for not getting any debug
information?  I do not have kernel debugging enabled, but do have SCSI
debugging in place.
If I enable kernel debugging, is that more likely to find something?
In the past when I had this problem, it was usually a kernel or driver
issue, and I rarely was able to get any debug information, but I'm open
to suggestions.
I cannot reproduce this problem on demand though.  It does happen when
there is moderate SCSI traffic, but doesn't seem to happen at the
highest SCSI bus loads.
I tried to cause the crash this week, but could not.  Thirty minutes
after I finally gave up, it happened.
Still have no information to go on, but I thought I would ask here in
case someone else is seeing trouble.
