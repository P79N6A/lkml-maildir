It isn't all that unlikely.  There's sshfs for example, that depends
on a separate ssh process for transport.
Oh, there are also userspace network transports, like tun/tap,
nfqueue, etc.  They could block any network filesystem (not just fuse)
if frozen first, making the freezer fail.
Hmm, wonder why this isn't affecting people with VPNs?  Probably
network mounts over VPN are rare, and ever rarer to have fs activity
on them during suspend.
Anyway, I think it's long overdue to stop thinking about how to "fix"
fuse, and concentrate on fixing the underlying problem instead ;)

Well, it would deadlock, if
 a) memory reclaim was synchronous, or
 b) large part of the memory was used for dirty file data
I can't remember if (a) was ever true.  And now the dirty ratio is 10%
by default, so if we go OOM because that 10% can't be reclaimed, there
is a more serious problem.
Swap over loop over fuse would be problematic, but that won't work for
some time yet ;)
