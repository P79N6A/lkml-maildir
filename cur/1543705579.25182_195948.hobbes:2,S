There are a couple of special cases that might be feasible without making
an ungodly mess. PTE pages spring to mind (particularly as they can be
in highmem too). They should be reasonably easy to move (assuming we can
use rmap to track them back to the process they belong to to lock them ...
hmmm ....)
