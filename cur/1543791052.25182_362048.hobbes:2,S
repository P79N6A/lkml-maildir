No PCI quirk code has ever called pci_enable_device() AFAICT.
Of course the _need_ to do such a thing might be another PPC-specific
(or OpenFirmware-specific?) PCI thing ... we've hit other cases where
PPC breaks things that work on other PCI systems (and vice versa).

If quirk code can't rely on BARs, then the PCI system needs some
basic overhauls ... yes?  I mean, how could quirk code ever work
if it can't access the relevant chip registers??

Erm, what "code is doing" what, that you mean ??

Which logic?  The fundamental thing those USB handoff functions do
is make sure that BIOS code lets go of the host controllers.  The
main reason it'd be using a controller is because of USB keyboards,
mice, or maybe boot disks.  Secondarily, that code needs to make
sure the controller is really quiesced before Linux starts using it.
