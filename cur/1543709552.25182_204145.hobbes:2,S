Heh, well, they should. You need to flush the dcache & invalidate the
icache over the kernel image after decompressing it. It's just that
those routines are totally broken as far as I can see, but I don't
think the pmac bootloaders will use them, they probably use a
different implementation that works.
Note that whatever machines are using those routines will probably
have trouble too anyway
