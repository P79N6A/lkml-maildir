Yup, that fixes it for structs. I guess I forgot to mention this earlier
because I didn't notice it until now... the same bug exists for
functions as well.
And apparently I never looked at the output for my description for
pm_set_ops.... maybe (hopefully!) it'll teach me to be more careful next
time.
