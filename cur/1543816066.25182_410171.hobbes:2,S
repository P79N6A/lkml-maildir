Because what happens when ther is a third party involved. As you know
the good design account for either "zero", "one" or "many"
clients/accessors. Code in anticipation of having only 2 possible
users is not a good practice.

That can be explored, although does not answer how you do about
allowing concurrent access to the hardware.

Doesn't it go through XBell (xkbbell to disable)?

I understand that the beeps kill music currently; they should not if
you have lower level module controlling access.
