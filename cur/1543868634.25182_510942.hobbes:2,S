Not to mention responding to the previous advice
of others (including myself and Theodore) who stated
there is no magic function in a driver that
directly supports the user mode cat program, and that
he should look at the tty settings controllable by stty.
(in particular clocal)
I also suggested running cat on a standard serial port
and getting that working first. Then applying those stty
settings to his custom device/driver.
(Background: he says other user mode programs work
to read/write but that cat < /dev/foocustom does nothing.)
