I've been looking at this. If you want to keep the struct backing_dev_info
reasonably stand-alone (no function pointer and aux data like I did) you
probably need to add a list of parent_queues to every request_list. If
the queue get congested, you mark the parent queue(s) congested as well.
Congested state would need to be changed into a counter instead of a
bitfield, I think.
The pdflush-is-running-on-this-queue bit can probably remain as-is. It's
mostly meant to prevent 2 pdflush daemons from running the same queue.
I don't see much harm in pdflush #1 running on /dev/md0 which consists
of /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 and pdflush #2 running on /dev/sdb2, right ?
Would that be the way to go? If so, I'll take a stab at it.
Mike.
