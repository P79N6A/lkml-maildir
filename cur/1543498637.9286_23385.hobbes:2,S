Someone with Alpha experience will have to answer the Alpha question.
With the x86, nested interrupts (at other than the current level) is
supported.
Therefore, the kernel, in the interrupt context, can be interrupted.
The amount of nesting is controlled only by the available interrupt
levels, i.e., 15 (one is the cascade). ISRs generally don't use
a lot of stack because they have to get/put data from something persistent
so there should be enough stack to handle whatever you have.
The last time I checked, the kernel stack is limited to only one page
(4096 bytes in x86, 8192 on Alpha), you could check the sources to see
if it is now greater.
