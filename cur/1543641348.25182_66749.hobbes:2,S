I'me new to kernel development and i've never fooled around with drivers 
before (I do have a course in it this september though, Wohoo!).
Why are you saying it would copy the data? Couldn't you just make some 
sort of shared memory system that would let you unencript/uncompress the 
data without having to do a copy?  The way i see it you can read the 
block, pass it through the necessary mods using the same data.  You 
could get a wierd race condition if your uncompress and your unencript 
work on the same data at the same time but that can easily be avoided 
 The way i see it, the NTFS driver should be able to read the file and 
uncompress.  The loop driver should have access to that block without 
having to do a copy to present it to a third party driver. Which then 
reads the data read by the driver and rpesents it as a filesystem.  
Maby even do away with loop.c, there should really be no loop.c .  A 
normal mount (/dev/hda1 for example) is a first level mount.  If you let 
/mnt/foo/myfile.iso be from /dev/hda1, then the chain should be 
/dev/hda1->ISO9660 module-->presentation.
I think the filesystem drivers should be written in such a way that they 
are totally pluggable with eachother.  That it doesn't matter where the 
blocks are comming from and going to.  You could have a mount of 
/dev/hda1 of an iso containing an ext2 image within it etc etc etc.
But like i said i'me new to kernel development so I think i might have 
the wrong perspective.
