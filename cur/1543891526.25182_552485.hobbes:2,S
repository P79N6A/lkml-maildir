Er, yes.  Me. :)
The Linux Foundation is paying me to focus on documentation for a while.  
(Woot!)  I just got 
http://kernel.org/doc
 up a few days ago (it needs lots 
more work), and I'm pondering setting up a git repository if my queue of 
patches to move files around in Documentation gets too long.  I'm also slowly 
reading through the "make htmldocs" output, beating on doclifter, writing new 
documentation...
What do you need? :)
