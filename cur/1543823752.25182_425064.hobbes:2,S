Hi Richard,
thanks for your prompt reply.

ok, I'll investigate. Thanks for the hint.

ok.

well, I guess re-calibrating using ts_calibrate will be easier than
trying to understand the proprietary calibration data format.

ok.  I have observed that this specific  hardware sometimes indicates a
pressure of '1' (out of a rage ~ 0...1000) even if the screen is not
pressed.  So I think there should be some level (maybe 10/20), only
after this level of pressure has been reached it should report a button
press.

ok, i see.  perfectly makes sense.

thanks again, will do so later today.

yes, I've actually managed to do a full task-bootstrap and task-gpe for
the device now (cross-compiled from my linuxppc64 quad-g5), and was
quite amazed that it almost worked out of the box.
