It isn't a problem with a make failing.  All the makes are successful,
it's just that i386_ksyms.very may or may not make it into modules.h,
and the only affect is on some symbols.  The kernel builds and boots
fine, it just might not load any modules for you.
This is a bug that will bite more and more people, and it isn't easy to
track down.
I have yet to have i386_ksyms.ver fail to make it into module.h with the
.PHONY line I posted earlier.  It seems like a good bandaid until
someone has the time to fix the creation of modules.h properly (e.g.,
only building it once in the top-level Makefile).
