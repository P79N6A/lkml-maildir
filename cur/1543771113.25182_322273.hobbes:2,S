Actually, I was talking about cmpxchg() primitive in the kernel,
not necessarily the instruction. ppc64 has a cmpxchg() primitive
based on LL/SC. For the archs that do not have cmpxchg(),
rcuref_inc_lf() uses a hashed lock to serialize the reference
count updates. It would be nice to see that code get a spin
on real hardware. AFAICS, sparc32 fits the bill.
