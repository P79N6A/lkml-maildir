	The benchmark has a ramp-up period built-in to populate the

	The thing is, the runs can be sensitive to some things (someone
logs in and runs something, Linux decides to flush some cache, etc).
The runs take long enough without extending them to flatten this some.

	If you notice, the variance always is of a fluke sort.  This is
why I do multiple runs.  The non-fluke runs are very consistent.  See
runs 1 and 3 for antic and 1 and 2 for deadline in the quote.

	I've not run other operating systems, as I don't have the
software or OSes installed.  I've not run a vanilla 2.4 recently, and
probably should do that.
