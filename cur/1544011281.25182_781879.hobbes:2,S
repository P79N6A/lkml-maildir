Subject: Update futex_q to clarify single waiter symmantics

From: Darren Hart <dvhltc@us.ibm.com>
I've tripped over this a couple times.  The futex_q uses a waiters list
to represent a single blocked task and then calles wake_up_all().  This
can lead to confusion in trying to understand the intent of the code,
which is to have a single futex_q for every task waiting on a futex.
This patch corrects the problem, using a single pointer to the waiting
task, and an appropriate call to wake_up, rather than wake_up_all.
Compile and boot tested on an 8way x86_64 machine.
