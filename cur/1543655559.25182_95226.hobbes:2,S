That's fine by me.  It's basically what I'm doing in 2.4, except that I
call it directly from the driver.  I'm just not in the habit of touching
other people's code.  
agp_intel_init() will be called twice though, first by i810fb, then the
usual inits, so a flag has to be set once the function is called.
If it's okay with you, I'll do it that way (and save me some 100 lines
of code in the process :-), and submit a patch.
