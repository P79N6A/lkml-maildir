Bryan,
Thanks for quick response.  It is good suggestion to doawload kernel from
website for development.  I will do it in later development.
To answer your question,
1, I don't have down/up in ISR routine.  System panic during making file
system.
   I have 32 Fibre Channel 32 HD connected on 4 FC HBA.  If using driver
without
   down/up for locking, no problem ever seen on making file system and IO
running
   for a quite while before system panic.  
2, The locking rquired in driver is for :
   a) Driver local queue, say free ccb list.  When on cpu is trying to put
      a ccb back to freelist and another is getting a free ccb, it requires
lock.
   b) Lower level (firmware level) reentrancy protection.
3, Our customer is using RH6.0 which is 2.2.5-15smp.  I have to support it
till
   the customer upgrade their Linux. 
Many thanks!

1.) you can't call down() at interrupt time, as it is basically going to
put the caller to sleep/schedule() if the count goes below 0.  Sleeping at
interrupt-time is not allowed.  You're almost certainly using this at
interrupt-time context, right?  I'm not certain exactly what kind of
locking you need, but investigate spinlocks:
linux/Documentation/spinlocks.txt
2.) 2.2.5-15smp is not a kernel version, but a particular packaging of a
particular kernel version by a particular vendor.  You should really be
downloading and working with the latest kernels "by-hand" if you're going
to do development.  This way you won't be chasing bugs that have already
been fixed, and you won't be relying on faith in someone elses idea of a
valid kernel configuration.
