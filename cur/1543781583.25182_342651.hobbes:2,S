Not really.  In the most common case, things have failed because the
system died unexpectedly, either through power loss or kernel bugs or
the like.  After such a clean unmount, a journal replay or fsck,
depending on the fs type, will fix things for you.  That works without
any knowledge, where the last write failed.
If the error is really an IO error, the behaviour is heavily dependent
on the fs you used.  Ext[23] will usually remount the fs read-only, so
you can hopefully retrieve all your data from the failing "hard
drive".  In that case, again, it doesn't matter much where things
broke.

Good to know.
