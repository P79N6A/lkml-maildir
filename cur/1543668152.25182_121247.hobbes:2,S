Hi Matthias.
When the script generates the changelog one person is often
listed twice or even more.
From 2.5.65:
> Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>:
>   o fix waitqueue leak in devfs_d_revalidate_wait
> 
> Christoph Hellwig <hch@sgi.com>:
>   o [XFS] remove fs/xfs/xfs_dqblk.h
Would it be possible to avoid this even with two so distinct adresses?
I see that regex will help here, but maybe not in all cases.
This is with the new script:
>Alan Cox <alan@hraefn.swansea.linux.org.uk>:
>  o Remove NO_VERSION from S390x exec32
>
>Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>:
>  o Make ide use proper removal-safe list handling (removes endless looping
>    / hang)
It is not OK to say that all 'alan@*' is actually Alan Cox.
I'm not familiar enough with Perl to try myself :-(
