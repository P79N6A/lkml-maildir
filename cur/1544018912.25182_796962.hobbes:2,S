Agreed.  How about this.
futex: comment requeue key reference symmantics
From: Darren Hart <dvhltc@us.ibm.com>
We've tripped over the futex_requeue drop_count refering to key2
instead of key1.  The code is actually correct, but is non-intuitive.
This patch adds an explicit comment explaining the requeue.
