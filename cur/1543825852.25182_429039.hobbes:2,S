I'm not sure whether we create a udev event when a new USB device is
connected.  If we don't, we certainly could.  Although this event wouldn't
contain information about the power budget shortfall, it would contain
vendor and product IDs.  These would be sufficiently specific for a custom
udev script to install the desired configuration.

Yes.  At least, I think so.  The change directly addresses a complaint 
filed here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-users&m=112438431718562&w=2
I haven't checked back with the original poster to make sure that his
problem has been solved, but presumably it has been.
As an alternative, we could allow an "over-budget window" of say 10%.  
Configurations that exceed the power budget by less than that amount would
still be accepted.  I don't know whether this would be enough of a help,
however.  I've heard of devices that claim to require 200 mA, for
instance.  It just doesn't seem right to enable them when the upstream hub
can only provide 100 mA.
