I'm going to guess that this is the entry in feature-removal.txt
that need an update then:
---------------------------
What:	old NCR53C9x driver
When:	October 2007
Why:	Replaced by the much better esp_scsi driver.  Actual low-level
	driver can be ported over almost trivially.
Who:	David Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
	Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
Cheers,
