Sparc did not do this, the person coding up the new DMA API
decided it was a good idea to implement the generic version
this way. :-)
I think it's rediculious that I have to implement the whole
new DMA API abstraction thing just to get rid of this PCI
dependency.
Why don't we put the enum dma_direction somewhere else?  Some
linux/foo.h header that doesn't require asm/dma*.h
