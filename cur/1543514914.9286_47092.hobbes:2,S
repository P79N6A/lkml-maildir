The R4000-style (not R4600-style) MIPS processor have a RP (Reduce Power)
bit in the the status register which when set will reduce the clock rate.
Of course the manuals don't define if this also affects the cycle counter
or not.
(Worse, the RP bit is documente in the manuals and the fineprint in some
erratas says this bit isn't implemented ...)
