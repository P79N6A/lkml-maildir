This whole "pre-link" idea sounds remarkably like the IRIX
Quickstart, which has been there for many years. The basic idea is:
  There is a new flag in binaries and dependent libraries/shared
  objects that tells whether the quickstart process (the rqs binary,
  specifically) has been run on it. The QS (quickstart) bit is
  cleared by default. All shared objects (DSOs) have a name,
  timestamp and other info.
  If the QS bit is set, then the dynamic loader (rld) considers
  using the pre-link fastpath. If not, it does the slow path (normal
  ELF runtime linking).
  The pre-link fastpath is followed if the DSO has the same
  timestamp info as stored in the linked-from object. Any libraries
  that fail the check will get runtime linked the slow way.
  Several things short-circuit the decision process, even if the QS
  bit is set: LD_PRELOAD (and equivalents) always go the slow path
  (this handles the specific question), s[ug]id binaries ignore the
  LD_* (etc) environment vars if the [ug]id isn't the owner (this
  fixes a large class of exploits).
I'm not an expert, so I hope I got it right...
