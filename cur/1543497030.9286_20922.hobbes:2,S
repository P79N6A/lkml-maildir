Did you answer 'M' to 'Kernel support for ELF binaries'?
  sprintf(modname, "binfmt-%04x", *(unsigned short *)(&bprm->buf[2]));
  request_module(modname);
where bprm->buf[2] is read from the start of the executable and 46 is
'F' and 4c is 'L'.  That makes me think that you compiled ELF bin
support as a module.  That would easily lead to a recursive loop since
init will require binfmt-464c and try to exec modprobe to load it,
which will require binfmt-464c, and so on.
