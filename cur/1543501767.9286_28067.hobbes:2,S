I think we agreed that combound files should have "inherit from parent"
attributes whenever useful, i.e. certainly for uid/gid/access control, when
appropriate. And then, even tar gives you the option to skip over uids. If you
run a backup restore, however, you want cat </dev/st0 >/ to restore uids,
as well.

Yes. But since filesystems should allow remote operations, some sort of
forward-assignment should be possible. Perhaps only per transaction, and the
server responds with the real numbers ("if you don't want to do another
forward assignment to the foo-bar atom, here's what I use to call it"). The
client can switch over to a less data-intensive protocol after a round trip
delay, but isn't delayed initially.
The other idea was to not even bother with the strings, but only take a
hash key and pass that around, including the risc of collisions. Well, I don't
like the idea of having two keys magically collide ;-).
