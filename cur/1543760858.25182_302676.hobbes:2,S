Here is a simple program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
main(){
  int err;
  err=read(0,NULL,6);
  printf("%d %d\n",err,errno);
}
I think that it should be an error : Null pointer assignment, like in windows.
But in practise it is not so. 
Mandrake Linux kernel 2.4.21-0.13mdk
I am a programmer too and i am very interested to solve this problem. Please, 
send me fragment of sourse code of kernel with this bug.
Thanks.
Sorry for my English
