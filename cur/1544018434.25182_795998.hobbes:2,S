There is also the option to use assembly wrappers to avoid relying on 
the calling convention.  This is particularly so since we have sites 
where as little as a two-byte instruction gets bloated up with huge 
push/pop sequences around a tiny instruction.  Those would be better 
served with a direct call to a stub (5 bytes), which would be repatched 
to the two-byte instruction + 3 byte nop.
