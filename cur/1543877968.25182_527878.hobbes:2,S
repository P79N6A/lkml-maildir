Bruellller!
So you are saying I am a marketing guy -- wasn't aware of that.
Just big fun.

I don't know this history. And I don't care.
I thought /proc/cpuinfo should show an (almost) complete list
of CPU features. If this is not the case it's a pity.

And finally I was not aware that you and Andi think of monitor/mwait
as a synonym for Intel's native C-States.
So I guess, what you really want is that for AMD CPUs the
monitor-flag (aka native C-state-flag) gets removed.
And if somedays another use case for monitor/mwait appears, the flag
has to be reintroduced for AMD CPUs.
Fine with me.
The only drawback is that Andi's idea of idle=mwait wouldn't make
sense anymore.

Andreas
