hmmmm ... actually, there is ... sort of:
$ find include -name compiler.h
include/asm-alpha/compiler.h
include/asm-mips/compiler.h
include/linux/compiler.h
$ grep -r "asm/compiler.h" *
arch/mips/kernel/cpu-bugs64.c:#include <asm/compiler.h>
arch/mips/kernel/time.c:#include <asm/compiler.h>
arch/mips/au1000/common/time.c:#include <asm/compiler.h>
arch/alpha/kernel/sys_sio.c:#include <asm/compiler.h>
include/asm-alpha/mmu_context.h:#include <asm/compiler.h>
include/asm-alpha/core_marvel.h:#include <asm/compiler.h>
include/asm-alpha/core_t2.h:#include <asm/compiler.h>
... lots more alpha stuff ...
  so there does appear to be some precedent for an asm/compiler.h.
for better or worse.
