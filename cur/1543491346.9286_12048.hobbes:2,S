Right now, I would put it at tsx-11.mit.edu /pub/linux/incoming (I forget
the exact path and I'm home right now. Include a .lsm file to tell
about it.
I think you could also send it to Alexy and if he likes it, Alan
will probably be persuaded to put it into the mainstream. I
think it is a very good idea. If it is implemented in such a
way that it has essentially zero impact upon normally-configured
networking, I think you have a winner. However, you are going
to have to convince several important people. These people are
reasonable, but not easy. Don't give up yet.
Cheers,
