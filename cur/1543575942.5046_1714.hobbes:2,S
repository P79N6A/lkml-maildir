Because neither
	<label>:		(nor)
	case <expr>:		(nor)
	default:
are statements by themselves.  They are an optional start of a statement.  The
ebnf looks like:
	statement:
		  labeled-statement
		| expression-statem
		| compoundstatement
		| selection-statement
		| iteration-statement
		| jump-statement
	labeled-statement:
		  identifier ':' statement
		| 'case' constant-expression ':' statement
		| 'default' ':' statement
