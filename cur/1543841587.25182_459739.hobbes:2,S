Hi Andrew,
I have been running into following bug while running fsx
tests on 1k (ext3) filesystem all the time. 
----------- [cut here ] --------- [please bite here ] ---------
Kernel BUG at fs/buffer.c:2791
invalid opcode: 0000 [1] SMP
Its complaining about BUG_ON(!buffer_mapped(bh)).
It was hard to track it down, needed lots of debug - but here 
is the problem & fix.  Since the fix is in __set_page_buffer_dirty()
code - I am wondering how it would effect others :(
With this fix fsx tests ran for more than 16 hours (and still
running).
Please let me know, what you think.
Thanks,
Badari 
Patch to fix: Kernel BUG at fs/buffer.c:2791
on 1k (2k) filesystems while running fsx.
journal_commit_transaction collects lots of dirty buffer from
and does a single ll_rw_block() to write them out. ll_rw_block()
locks the buffer and checks to see if they are dirty and submits
them for IO.
In the mean while, journal_unmap_buffers() as part of
truncate can unmap the buffer and throw it away. Since its
a 1k (2k) filesystem - each page (4k) will have more than
one buffer_head attached to the page and and we can't free 
up buffer_heads attached to the page (if we are not
invalidating the whole page).
Now, any call to set_page_dirty() (like msync_interval)
could end up setting all the buffer heads attached to
this page again dirty, including the ones those got
cleaned up :(
If ll_rw_block() runs now and sees the dirty bit it does
submit_bh() on those buffer_heads and triggers the assert.
Fix is to check if the buffer is mapped before setting its
dirty bit in __set_page_dirty_buffers().
