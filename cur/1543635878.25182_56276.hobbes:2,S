This only prooves that you are uninformed :-(
In addition, the exiestence of thiid ioctl is just another proof
that there is no overall planning in Linux. Everyone adds new 
interfaces without any concept. If Linux likes to convert from 
a hobbyist kernel to a professional OS, there is need for overall
planning by people who know about OS concepts.
For now, I only see people who may know a lot about Linux but lack
general OS knowledge. Knowlede does not result from looking at your belly
but from looking at other people's ideas...
