I can't seem to get make to build the objects in pci/ before compiling
in the top level ide directory and a cross-directory dependency on
pci/cmd640.o isn't exactly nice. :(  I could use some help, fs/Makefile
does exactly what ide needs (builds objects in fs's subdirs then links them
together with fs/*.o, except for for -y, not -m) but contains no magic
whatsoever as far as I can tell.
