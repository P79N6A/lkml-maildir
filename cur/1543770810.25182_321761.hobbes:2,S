This is redundant. Any attempt to compile vanilla 2.4 with gcc4
will fail with compilation errors. (And except for one issue on
x86-64 which actually was a kernel bug, those are the only known
issues with using gcc4 for 2.4.)
OTOH, for those of us that do use gcc4, this just gets in the way
and forces the gcc4 fixes kit for 2.4 to be even larger.
Since distributors won't use gcc4 for 2.4, and naive users won't
succeed anyway, what's the point?
