My feeling is that we lose enough with the rather fixed
nature of the frequency selection that we should keep the
calculations as accurate as possible. It isn't a big loss
to have 64bit calcs as we don't change mode that often.

Ok, will look at removing

That, iirc, is only needed for acceleration functions that
may change the fb data before any of the non-accelerated
ops happen. Basically, it is for the card to hold off any
non-accelerated drawing until the acceleration unit has
finished.

I really hope we can get this merged this kernel release.
