okay, i've applied it in the form below, to tip/core/resources. This in 
combination with the toning down of the messages should do the trick i 
think.
btw., here's a bug that got caught by the sanity checks:

|     V4L/DVB (9356): [PATCH] saa7134: fix resource map sanity check conflict
| 
|     Impact: driver could possibly stomp on resources outside of its scope
so it's not just nuisance.

it will be much more likely to be caught via other misbehavior i guess.

Subject: [PATCH] resources: skip sanity check of busy resources
Impact: reduce false positives in iomem_map_sanity_check()
Some drivers (vesafb) only map/reserve a portion of a resource.
If then some other driver comes in and maps the whole resource,
the current code WARN_ON's. This is not the intent of the checks
in iomem_map_sanity_check(); rather these checks want to
warn when crossing *hardware* resources only.
This patch skips BUSY resources as suggested by Linus.
Note: having two drivers talk to the same hardware at the same
time is obviously not optimal behavior, but that's a separate story.
