Why?  USB serial drivers have been handling dynamic minors since 2.2
days.  Also works for the USB bluetooth driver, and the USB acm driver
which register with tty_register_device() when a new tty minor is to be
used.
Al, any changes that you want to make to the tty layer, I will gladly
fix up the USB drivers so they work again.  Don't let USB drivers worry
you, they can always be changed, as long as the same functionality is
there :)
