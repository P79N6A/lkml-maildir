	Hello,
	I'm trying to use iproute (20041019) with 2.4.29 official kernel on
	a UltraSparc 1E. I have marked all packets that come from an
	intranet server (192.168.0.130:3000 / tcp) like this :
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 13344 packets, 1830K bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source
destination         
   89  5340 MARK       tcp  --  *      *       192.168.0.130
0.0.0.0/0           tcp spts:3000:3001 MARK set 0x1 
	And I have logged the result of iptables. All packets are marked.
	So, I have written a new rule with iproute :
Root kant:[/var/log] > ip rule show
0:      from all lookup local 
100:    from 192.168.1.1 lookup intranet 
101:    from all fwmark 0x1 lookup intranet 
32766:  from all lookup main 
32767:  from all lookup default 
Root kant:[/var/log] > ip route show table intranet
default via 192.168.1.254 dev eth2 
Root kant:[/var/log] > 
	My intranet table is ignored. But I can use the second interface. If
	I replace "from all fwmark 0x1 lookup intranet" by ""from
	192.168.0.130 lookup intranet", all packets coming from my intranet
	server all redirected conforming to intranet table. Any idea ? Is
	iproute broken with 2.4.29 ?
	Thanks in advance,
	JKB
