EF_IA_64_LINUX_EXECUTABLE_STACK is using elf_ex->e_flags. I did it the
same way for x86 originally, but the tools people specifically rejected it
as a hack. We dont control the ELF specification, but a new gcc section
like PT_GNU_STACK is fair game. So it might be 'bloat' but it's clean and
doesnt try to hijack.
