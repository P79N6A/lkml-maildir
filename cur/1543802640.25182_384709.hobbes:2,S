Disabling signals for most of the main loop and activating them just
around the select()/poll/... is one solution to the problem.
Then this leaves the race if an old pid is reused in a newly created
process before the last instances of that pid is cleaned up. But this is
probably only a theoretical problem (unless you fork() very very
often) ....
