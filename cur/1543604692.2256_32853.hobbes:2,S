All inodes are in the same sector.
Could you try out if that sector is destroyed?
One of my broken harddisks showed similar behaviour:
* write operations succeeded.
* read operations immediately after the write (write 16 MB including the
damaged sector, then read all 16 MB) sometimes succeeded.
* read operations after 5 minutes always failed.
