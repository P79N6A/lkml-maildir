I know only one at a time is root.  Its just that say I have uid 306
on the nfs server (which might be one of your array of root uids on
your linux box).  I also have an account on your linux box.  I can
crack root by starting a process on the linux box that just sits and
waits until root_uid == 306, and then does its nasty stuff.

The only thing is that it'll be hard for you to choose 500 uids and
disable them over nfs without breaking a lot of sites NFS setups.  or
disable one at a time and explain to that user why he can't get to his 
home directory.

OK, but how do you stop binaries from doing this sort of thing:
if (euid == 0) {
	...drop privs
}
Do you map the current root_uid to zero in calls to get/seteuid etc?

Nothing is special about 0 except that it is special.  The thing about 
root and uid 0 is that you know its special and all-powerful, so you
take steps to protect it.  Its much more difficult to protect a moving 
target.

That's true.  The problem is that if you think "I don't know why
noone's ever thought of this before" that should be a bit of a warning 
sign.  Some pretty clever people have worked on unix over the last
twenty years or so, and its just possible that some of them will have
seen the pitfalls of your new idea (whatever it is).  On the other
hand if you're sure you've got a good idea you could try to prove us
all wrong. 
A good place to start for a linux project might be to port something
that they have in another unix to linux.  For example I think openBSD
(it might be one of the others) has a lot of security features that
might be interesting to port, including random pids.  When a process
starts up it doesn't have a sequential process id, it just gets a
random number.  This makes stuff like /tmp races much less likely. Its 
also a project of (probably) manageable size.  We generate
high-quality random numbers in the kernel already.  You're just going
to add a fixed overhead to process startup because you'll have to look 
up in a hash to see if that pid is already taken or something.  You'll 
also have to clear the pid hash entry when the process dies.

Sorry.  There's a difference between criticising your idea and
criticising you.  I certainly never meant to insult you.  Part of the
problem was that I didn't think you had given the full implications of
your idea a whole lot of thought.  I also misunderstood the tone of
your original mail, and thought you were saying your stuff was a
masterpiece (which got me a little riled)
I hope this initial onslaught hasn't put you off kernel hacking
entirely.  There's a whole lot of people cleverer than me on the list, 
and I'm sure someone can suggest a great project for you.  If you mail 
me privately, I'll be happy to give you a load of references to get
you started.
