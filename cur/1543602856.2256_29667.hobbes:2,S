Hi people,
I was taking a closer look at 2.4.10's mark_page_accessed() changes
(unfortunately just now, I've been quite busy lately with other issues)
and I noticed that readahead pages are not having their referenced bit set
when they are found in cache.
page_cache_read() (called by generic_file_readahead()), will simply do a
pagecache lookup and return in case the (being readahead) page is already
there. 
I've done some experiments in the past trying to use a new GFP_ flag for
allocation of readahead pages. This new GFP flag was the indicator to
__alloc_pages() that it should fail very easily (so, in theory, we would
not spend time on page reclaiming for readahead, which is simply a guess).
With the above working, I got much slower results: It showed me in
practice, with real numbers, that the additional page reclaiming work for
readahead pages was worth due to the avoided disk seeks.
So I think it makes quite some sense to avoid readahead pages from being
removed from the cache easily, by calling mark_page_accessed() at
page_cache_read():

        if (!page)
NOTE: I'm saying that it is _bad_ to throw away readahead pages easily
because I've seen it in practice. I'll try to test this in real practice
again soon (not this week) to make sure.
