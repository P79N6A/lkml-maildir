Ok, but what about openning with O_SYNC?  Surely that should sync the data.
This issue came up because I was looking at how much disc activity the
various sync options causes on an ext3 filesystem, and on the journal
(which I had on a separate drive so I could differentiate journal IO
and filesystem IO).
You've probably already seen them on ext3-users, but I will repeat the
numbers below for linux-kernel readers.
If we forget about the "sync" mounts, as there is some question over
their intended semantics, the issue becomes that ext3 does not appear
to properly honour "fsync" in data=writeback mode (unless the data is
going to the journal on fsync) and does not properly honour O_SYNC
*except* in data=writeback mode.
Andrew's patch fixes O_SYNC in data=journal and data=ordered modes,
but does not fix fsync in data=writeback mode.

-------------------------------------
Results:
For each test I wrote the first 40000 bytes of a pre-existing file 100
times and counted the nubmer of scsi operations (which may be
multi-block operations) on the filesytem device (first column) and the
journal device (second column).
For "async" I open, write, close  100 times.
For "fsync" I open, write, fsync, close 100 times.
For "osync" I open(,O_SYNC), write, close 100 times.
