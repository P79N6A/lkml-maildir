Thanks for that.  Now if you can just persuade the Alpha people to
print the 'Code:' line in the same format as other architectures then
ksymoops can decode the instructions as well.  If Alpha wants to
include its own instruction decoder as well then that is up to them but
I would appreciate a standard 'Code:' line being printed first.
