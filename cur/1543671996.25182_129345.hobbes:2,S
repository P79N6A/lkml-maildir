No, don't do the compilers job.  Just write
        if (tv->usec < 0 || tv->usec >= USEC_PER_SEC) { ... }
This is easier to read, portable, and generates the same machine code
as your C code, at least in all gcc versions since gcc-2.7.2.3 (I
don't have older gcc versions here on my machine to test).
