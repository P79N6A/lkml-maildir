Currently snsc_event for Altix systems sends SIGPWR to init (and abuses
tasklist_lock..) while the sbus drivers call execve for /sbin/shutdown
(which is also ugly, it should at least use call_usermodehelper)
With normal sysvinit both will end up the same, but I suspect the
shutdown variant, maybe with a sysctl to chose the exact path to call
would be cleaner.  What do you guys think about adding a common function
to do this.  Could you test such a patch for me?
