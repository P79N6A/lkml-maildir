Subject: [PATH] Cleanups for XFree86/AGPGART cruft

The subject says it all, I got annoyed by the "you probably
want to use this to test XFree86 3.3.6 with Utah-GLX" phrase which
was spread to most, if not all CONFIG_AGP_ configure help texts.
Utah-GLX is mostly dead by now anyway, but let's only mention it
in CONFIG_AGP, as well as DRI or others.
