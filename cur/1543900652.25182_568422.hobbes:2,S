Subject: libata [ata_piix] still no resume from S3 ?

Hi to all!
I'm on Debian Sid with kernel 2.6.21 and I still can't resume my laptop
(Sony Vaio SZ2) from S3. Searched on the archive and it seems that SATA 
drives are getting problems when used via the "new" libata. When the
laptop tries to resume, it can't access the hard drive anymore (the LED
never blinks), the filesystem is mounted read-only and of course, the
system hangs. I still can see a "Lost interrupt" apearing on my LCD when
it is resuming. Sometimes it is IRQ 22, other times it is IRQ 23.
Is this still a know problem? Does 2.6.22 solve this already? If you
need more information about my environment, please ask :)
Ruben
