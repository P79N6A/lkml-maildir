Yup, but then, the user have to take care that behind a single "error
checking" entity (a bridge for example), all devices have such drivers
that honor the bridge-level locking and not their own.
On ppc64, I think we always have 1 bridge = 1 slot though, makes things
easier (well, provided we don't start to try playing with error coming
from slots on the g5).

Right.
