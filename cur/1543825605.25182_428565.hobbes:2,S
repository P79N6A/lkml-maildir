I added some debug info to the thread and got stack overflows; it was
trivial to double the size of the stack. I was saving a back trace of
the stack during at each preemption point (Ex: spinlock) to allow
me to see the context of the active holders of spinlocks. I configured
it with CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT_AUDIT and enabled large stacks in:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 			include/asm-i386/thread_info.h:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT_AUDIT
#define THREAD_SIZE     (8192 * 2)
#else
#ifdef CONFIG_4KSTACKS
#define THREAD_SIZE         (4096)
#else
#define THREAD_SIZE         (8192)
#endif
#endif
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
All you really need to do is change THREAD_SIZE from 
(8192) to (8192 * 2). I didn't have any problems in i386.

I was getting stack overflows on the SPARC architecture when compiling
the kernel -O1 for kgdb/kdbx debugging. I allocated a hot physical page
for each CPU as it was brought on line and then mapped it on the fly
when we got a stack overflow. I then pushed out the register window that
caused the trap, and then continued with the normal panic path. 
 
Perhaps we should add a kgdb config menu option and #define
CONFIG_16KSTACKS to double the stack size so the kernel can be 
debugged with more context available. I'm currently using -O0 for 
the networking stack and -O1 for the rest of the kernel. Sounds like 
it would be helpful now for AMD64 targets.
