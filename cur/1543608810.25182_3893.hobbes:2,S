Here's my version of hard cpu id (RTLinux version):
extern inline int rtl_getcpuid(void)
{
        unsigned cpu;
        __asm__ (
                        "str %%ax\n\t"
                        "shr $5, %%eax\n\t"
                        "sub $3, %%eax\n\t"
                        : "=a"(cpu));
        return cpu;
}
No cr2 involved; extremely fast. This takes advantage of the fact that
TSS-CPU mapping is 1-1 in 2.4.
