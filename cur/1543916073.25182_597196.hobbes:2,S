Nope.
Example:
char x;
void testb(void)
{
        if (x > 5)
                testa();
}
Would turn into:
  56:   b0 00                   mov    $0x0,%al
  58:   3c 05                   cmp    $0x5,%al
  5a:   7e 05                   jle    61 <testb+0x11>
(6 bytes)
Rather than:
  56:   80 3d 00 00 00 00 05    cmpb   $0x5,0x0
  5d:   7e 05                   jle    64 <testb+0x14>
(9 bytes)
So actually, immediate values well used make the code smaller. By the
way, I recommend using the smallest immediate values required, which
will often be a single byte.

It *helps* :) And by the way, icache on recent x86 and x86_64 is a trace
cache, so I don't see your point anyway.

With the size of the caches we currently have, that kind of workload
will not show any measurable difference: the signal/noise ratio is way
to small to detect that kind of performance difference under such
workload. Try it if you want.
The real-world speedup I am interested into is to have almost -zero-
tracer impact, which imples being undetectable even in the smallest and
shortest functions. I guess nobody is interested in adding a measurable
performance hit to kmalloc fast path, right ?

Without considering kernel/immediate.o, it will make the code smaller
and add 3*8bytes=24bytes of data in the __immediate section per
immediate value reference (data only used for updates).
