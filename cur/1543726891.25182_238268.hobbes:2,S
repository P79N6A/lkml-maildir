I noticed that in ata_pci_remove_one, that scsi_unregister_module() is
being called for the SCSI host template.  I also noticed that the SATA
drivers are calling scsi_unregister_module() in their cleanup routines
as well.  Is this work-in-progress, or an actual bug?  In any case, the
scsi_unregister_module() call in ata_pci_remove_one() takes an exception
with a NULL sht upon driver unload (when I'm experimenting with the
sata_nv module).  Commenting out the scsi_unregister_module() call in
ata_pci_remove_one() fixes things.
