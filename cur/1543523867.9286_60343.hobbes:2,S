   It happened when ppp connection was terminated (remote end hangup).
   Serial driver is Comtrol Rocketport. The problem is repeatable
   (3 times last 20 hours), so I can investigate further to see who
   is the caller.
I think it's a flase positive.  It's happeninig because tty_do_hangup()
is calling ldisc.open --- which means n_tty_open() inside an interrupt
context.  n_tty_open() makes a check to see whether it is being called
inside an interrupt, and uses GFP_ATOMIC to avoid blocking inside the
interrupt.  
static int n_tty_open(struct tty_struct *tty)
{
	....
		get_zeroed_page(in_interrupt() ? GFP_ATOMIC : GFP_KERNEL);
	...
}
This should be OK, I think.
