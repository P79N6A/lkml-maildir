I'm fairly sure the docs are outdated (but may well be correct for older 
gcc versions - as I already discussed elsewhere, that "+" thing was not 
historically useful).
We've been using "+m" for some time in the kernel on several 
architectures.
git aficionados can do
	git grep -1 '"+m"' v2.6.17
to see the pre-existing usage of this (most of them go back a lot further, 
although some of them are newer - the <asm-i386/bitops.h> ones were added 
in January.
So if "+m" didn't work, we've been in trouble for at least the last year.
