I left out one detail of the database processes. There are also data writers that responsible for write back dirty buffers to free up buffer for new transactions. These processes also need to be renice to higher priority (-19). When data writers are left at nice-0, the workload was throttle by the limited number of free buffers and we cannot even fully utilize the system. I had to renice data writer and log writer process.

The 6.4ms log write latency was measured in the foreground process. It went like this:
1. Foreground progress get start time and post log writer, foreground wait and sleep.
2. log writer was scheduled and collect log data. 
3. log writer write to log file and wait for i/o.
4. Write completed. log writer use vector post to wake up all the waiting foreground process.
5. Foreground process wake up and get end time.

There were 371 log writes per second so ~2.7ms per log writer execution. Out of this we know ~2.13 ms was spent waiting for log file i/o. Log writer was running for (2.7ms - 2.13ms) = 0.57ms

With the current throughput, log writer should be constantly writing log and rarely sleep.

Log writer wake multiple foreground processes using vector post.
