I'm not certain the odd behavior can occur on systems that use an
interconnect like Paul described.  In the context I was describing, rmb()  
guarantees only that any changes seen _and acknowledged_ by the cache
preceding the rmb() will be seen by any reads following the rmb().  It's a
weaker guarantee, but it still suffices to show that
	A = 1		b = B
	wmb		rmb
	B = 2		a = A
will work as expected.
