 (not that the reviews have been very kind)
Nor has an official product been released.  Reviewing hardware
and software in open development model before it is officially
stamped "final release" is unfair to say the least.  I follow the
agenda list and it is a nice piece of hardware and the software
is coming along quite nicely.  I've heard mostly good stuff about
it so far, although it is not a consumer level product yet - it
is a developers product, for people ready to fire up emacs and
start coding.
