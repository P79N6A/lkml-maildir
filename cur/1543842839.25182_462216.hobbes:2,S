Looks like it's only there on Intel CPUs with CPUID level >= 0x00000004
and AMD CPUs with extended CPUID level >= 0x80000006, like this one:
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 15
model           : 72
It's not there on:
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 6
Oh well...
