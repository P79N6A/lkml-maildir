In linux 2.5.70, with no patches applied, we've had one BUG of the form:
kernel BUG at include/linux/blkdev.h:407!
This is running a database workload, on an 8-way x86 machine with 4gig
of memory.  we've seen this only once, after 6 hours of run time.
Ironically, the BUG occurs during a part of the test that is not
particularly disk I/O intensive. The disk I/O that IS going on at this
time is predominantly sequential writes to a logging device.
no file systems are involved.

The BUG is occuring in DAC960_ProcessRequest, which essentially does:
The DAC960_ProcessRequest 
{
	elv_next_request
	blkdev_dequeue_request
}
It looks as though there was a request on the request queue
when elv_next_request was called, but it was removed before
blkdev_dequeue_request is called.  The only scenarios I can
imagine this happening would be if there were some flaw in the
locking code around accesses to the request queue, or if there were
some other kind of memory corruption going on.
Regarding locking,
Called from DAC960_RequestFunction, which is entered and exited
with queue_lock held.
Called from DAC960_BA_InterruptHandler(), with queue_lock held.
I'm looking for some hints on how to track down what's happening, so that
when it happens again, we can get more information.
I'm thinking of starting by stashing a copy of the request structure found
on the request queue, and dumping it out at BUG() time, to see if
examining the data there gives any hint what happened to it.
