The point I was trying to make was that on some systems writes are not
strongly ordered, so we need mmiowb() on _all_ systems. I'll fix the text to
make that point.

No. That depends on the properties of the memory window readw/writew write
through, the properties of the CPU wrt memory accesses, and what explicit
barriers at interpolated inside readw/writew themselves.
If we're accessing a frame buffer, for instance, we might want it to be able
to reorder and combine reads and writes.

Yes. There are quite a few different ways to disable interrupts.

I believe I've said that, though perhaps not sufficiently clearly.

Thanks, I probably will.
