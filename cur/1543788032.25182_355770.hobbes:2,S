That make sense.

Well a special call site certainly but I can probably get away
with a single function called from the appropriate CPU.  I
might even be able to remove nmi_cpu_busy :)
It will take me a bit to get my head back into that part of the
code.  late_initcall was a nice solution from a correctness
and simplicity point of view.  But obviously it had other issues :)
There is the whole late_timer_init() which is probably where
the test needs to happen for the boot processor.
