Hi Ross,
I have rediffed your two patches for vanilla 2.6.0-test11.  Briefly, I tried the apic patch first, and found that there are no lockups so far; well it passed my grep tests and even a kernel compile =).  Then I tried your io_apic patch + apic patch.  With nmi_watchdog=1 "NMI:" in /proc/interrupts increments alot compared to nmi_watchdog=2 before (as much as the timer).  So I believe your two patches are more correct than the other two.  Especially the fact I can run with CPU Disconnect and not lock up just like windows ... for people that have windows (I dont have windows =) plus a probably working nmi_watchdog.
And for comparison, my setup:
Shuttle AN35N Ultra v 1.1  (Nforce2 400 ultra), bios updated
Athlon Barton 2600+ (1.9 Ghz)
256 MB PC3200, single stick.
The patches are included in this mail.  I suppose the next thing to do is get out of nvidia the corresponding information.  And then clean up the patch for inclusion.
Jesse
