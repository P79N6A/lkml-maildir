Andy, why does the ACPI code have this test?
Is it to determine whether a caller of this functon is currently holding a
spinlock?  If so then it will only work on a preemptible kernel.
A non-preempt kernel will not increment preempt_count() when it takes a
spinlock and ACPI could mistakenly schedule away and cause a system deadlock.
