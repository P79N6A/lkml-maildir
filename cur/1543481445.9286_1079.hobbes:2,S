I always thought the biggest problem was caused by backward gotos. That
was what caused the number of possible paths to explode combinatorially.
Forward gotos are just one way of expressing an end to a logic sequence
and don't increase the number of possible paths.... sometimes they
decrease them... and they often decrease the nesting level which can make
code harder to read and understand.
