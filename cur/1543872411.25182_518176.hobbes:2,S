The idea is to keep the output value at 0 and switch the output driver on
and off. I assumed that changing the direction was the easiest way to
achieve this.
I never really thought about output-only pins. Is it actually possible to
implement i2c properly on such hardware?

Isn't it better to switch the direction to input since the driver needs to
watch the pin state in order to support clock stretching and multi-master?

No I really do mean input, as I want to put the bus into an idle state
initially, which means no output drivers and passive pullup on both lines.
The gpio_set_value() calls should go away and the output value should be
explicitly set to 0 when turning on the output drivers. In its present
form, the driver happens to work on my hardware, which is all I really
cared about when writing it ;-)

Ok, but how do I inform i2c-algo-bit about whether or not clock stretching
is supported?

Sure.
