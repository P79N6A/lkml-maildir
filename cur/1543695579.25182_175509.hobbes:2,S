2.4.23-pre8 fixed that, so the serial emulation is working now.
How can I grove the serial baud rate?  After I change the baud rate over
9600 bps in minicom, I see only the noise and cannot communicate with
the built-in modem of my phone.  In the phone I can't force the
communication speed, so I have to use some software solution.
RTFM with a pointer to any relevant documentation is sufficient for me.
Thank for your help,
Gabor
