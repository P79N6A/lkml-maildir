This was exported so it could be used in the classification engine
which is a loadable module which determines how and when tasks join
classes.  There are two classification engines - a basic one (RBCE)
and a more advanced one (CRBCE).  The latter allows a user to set some
basic rules on how newly created tasks will join a class.

I'll clean this up later this afternoon and regen a patch.
