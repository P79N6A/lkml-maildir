I cleaned it and also tested it on SMP. I need to run a few more tests
on x86 (as I mainly work on ARM) and release a new version this
weekend.
A problem I'm facing (also because I'm not familiar with the other
architectures) is detecting the effective stack boundaries of the
threads running or waiting in kernel mode. Scanning the whole stack
(8K) hides some possible leaks (because of no longer used local
variables) and not scanning the list at all can lead to false
positives. I would need to investigate this a bit more.
