Marcelo, Alan
Since the "hacky" Athlon/AGP fix has now been removed again, what's the
status of the "clean" fix? And while I'm at it, did the hacky one cause
any specific problems?
For me, the hacky one _seemed_ to work, in that my machine survives a
lot longer with or without the blasted nVidia driver. It might be
imagination / coincidence, but it would be really nice to see this issue
fixed once and for all....
Cheers
Alastair
