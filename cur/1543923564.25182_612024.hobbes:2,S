Looks OK to me, in general. How much userspace have you tested building
with this? Does it include stuff like gdb?
Not that I necessarily care about the answer in the normal way -- it's
just that if userspace will need to adapt, I'd like to get them moving
ASAP. One option for easing that might be to export stuff like page.h
but _empty_.
