The problem with this behaviour is that the old root fs can not be 
unmounted in this case, which basically means that the machine will be 
unable to switch off its harddisk. And that, at least in my case, is 
annoying :)

I have to admin that I don't really know the internals and thus don't 
completely understand. What would need to be done to fix it ? Change 
init's re-exec routines ?
