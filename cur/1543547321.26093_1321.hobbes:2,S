That's not the issue.  The issue is that the type creeps through
the entire rest of the VFS and page cache.  Once the page cache
is affected, we're no longer talking about seeks and disk reads.
In any case, I'm not defending the decision, but reporting previous
discussion.  Anyway, it's not like I'd care -- I've got Alphas.
