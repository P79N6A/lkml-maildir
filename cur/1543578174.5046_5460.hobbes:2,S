Greetings.
Where can I find in-depth information on ACPI and APM?  I'd like
  to get the problems I've found in 2.2.18 and 2.4.0 fixed.
Ideally, I'd like information on *exactly* how to suspend my
  laptop (Toshiba 1605CDS, Phoenix BIOS).  I.e., what IO ports, 
  memory ranges, interrupts to use, and how to use them.
Anyone know where to go for this?  It doesn't look like Toshiba
  is going to be very helpful telling me about their BIOS interface.
Thanks!
                              -Joseph
