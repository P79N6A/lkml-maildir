(did I reply to this already?  I forget)
We don't need any sysfs options.  Just normal SG_IO sending a SET 
FEATURES - XFER MODE command to the desired device.
Currently, that [sub-]command is intentionally filtered out because of 
the problems that would ensue.
Once the above EH mods are in place, we simply remove that filter, and 
The Right Thing(tm) happens when you submit an ATA command via normal 
methods.  No need for new sysfs hooks or new ioctls or anything.
