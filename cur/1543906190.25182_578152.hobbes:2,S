This topic seems to come up periodically every since we first introduced
the NUMA scheduler, and every time we decide it's a bad idea. What's
changed? What workloads does this improve (aside from some artificial
benchmark like stream)?
To repeat the conclusions of last time ... the primary problem is that
99% of the time, we exec after we fork, and it makes that fork/exec
cycle slower, not faster, so exec is generally a much better time to do
this. There's no good predictor of whether we'll exec after fork, unless
one has magically appeared since late 2.5.x ?
