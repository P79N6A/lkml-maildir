Would anybody write "Silent corruption on i386" or "Silent corruption 
on Intel" or "Silent corruption on Linux"?]

You could disable the hardware checksumming support in the card with
the appended patch. Then hopefully Linux will catch most corruptions
(but perhaps not all because TCP checksums are not very strong) 
You can watch failed checksums then with netstat -s
