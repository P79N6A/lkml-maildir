The warning that triggered (lockdep.c:700) means that one class (key)
was used with more than one name.
Looking at cleanup_workqueue_thread(), the lock_acquire() there works on
wq->lockdep_map, and that is only initialized at one spot:
__create_workqueue_key(), thus it stands to reason that that was
mis-used.
