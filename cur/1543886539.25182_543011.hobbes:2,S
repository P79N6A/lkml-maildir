The range of symbols is just provided to handle inaccuracies
in mid-function and mid-object references, it actually helps.
In this particular case iq80321_timer, which is not init-data,
is referencing iq80321_timer_init() which is init.text
If this is legitimate (which I believe this case is, the init function
method can be init but the offset one is not), add an exception case
like we already have for console drivers et al. to modpost.c and this
warning will go away.
