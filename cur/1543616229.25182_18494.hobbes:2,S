Actually, both preempt-kernel and low-latency do about the same amount
of work re saving state.
With preempt-kernel, when a task is preempted in-kernel we AND a flag
value into the preempt count.  That is all we need to keep track of
things.
With low-latency, the task state is set to TASK_RUNNING (which is a
precautionary measure).  So it is about the same, although low-latency
(and lock-break) often also have to do various setup with the locks and
all.
