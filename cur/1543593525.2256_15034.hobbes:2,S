Mike and others, I am getting tired of your comments.  Sheesh.  
The various developers who actually work on the VM have already
acknowledged the issues and are exploring fixes, including at 
least one patch that already exists.  It seems clear that the 
uproar from the people who are having trouble with the new VM's 
handling of swap space have been heard and folks are going to 
fix these problems.  It may not happen today or tomorrow, but 
soon.  What the heck else do you want?
Making enflammatory remarks about the current situation does 
nothing to help get the problems fixed, it just wastes our time 
and bandwidth.
So please, if you have new facts that you want to offer that
will help us characterize and understand these VM issues better
or discover new problems, feel free to share them.  But if you
just want to rant, I, for one, would rather you didn't.
