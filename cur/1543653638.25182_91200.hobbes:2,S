It is in hardirq.h, arch specific, 11 of the 20 hardirq.h files would
need the change (they reference kernel_locked) to include smp_lock.h.
665 files include smp_lock.h
89  files include hardirq.h
32  files include both
So, should I change the arch hardirq.h files to include smp_lock.h,
or just add smp_lock.h to scsi_lib.c?
