I've been testing a bit more here, and I can't get this particular bug. I have others though:
Out of my five MMC cards, only two work properly. One doesn't respond to SPI commands at all, and two hang on a second CMD0 and return ILLEGAL_COMMAND on a second run of CMD1. All of this is of course wildly out of spec. SPI seems to be a bonus, not a given. :/
As for your card, could you send me a dump as I'm unable to produce the issue here?
