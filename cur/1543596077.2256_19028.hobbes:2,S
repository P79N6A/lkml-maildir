I've had issues with the Intel cards, as well.
What revision of the card is it?
Have you tried the drivers available from Intel, to see if they do a
better job? In my case, they didn't.
I've also had reports, for a linux-2.2.x kernel, that sometimes its
guesswork as to whether stock kernel eepro100, the intel e100 driver, or
Don Becker's eepro100 will work on the beasts.
HTH.
