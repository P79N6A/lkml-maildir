Which Serverworks chipset? There are various.
I for one need to pass "noapic" on the kernel command line. Otherwise
the IRQ routing is broken, I can't get the USB IRQ and the kernel complains.
a lot about a broken APIC IRQ routing.
My board is an ASUS CUR-CLS. The chipset there is "ServerWorks LE".
