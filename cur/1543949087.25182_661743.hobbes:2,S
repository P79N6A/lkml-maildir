a better approach would be to send the core bits to Linus right now - as 
long as it's Kconfig isolated and inactive code - hence it is eligible 
as a cleanup.
That means arch maintainers could start applying the patches at their 
own pace, starting right now, in their own work-flow and test-flow. 
(obviously, the first such patches would hit mainline starting in the 
next merge window)
And all the linux-next integration trouble down the line is avoided, and 
each architecture can do a concentrated effort of: 'get rid of semaphore 
code'.
Please!
