Pavel, I'm afraid that you are missing the point. Several, actually:
	* limits of _human_ capability to deal with large unstructured
sets of objects
	* userland issues (what, you thought that limits on the
command size will go away?)
	* portability
The point being: applications and users _do_ know better what structure
is there. Kernel can try to second-guess them and be real good at that, but
inability to second-guess is the last of the reasons why aforementioned
strategies are used.
