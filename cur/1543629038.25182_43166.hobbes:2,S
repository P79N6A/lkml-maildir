Unfortunately one of the problems occurs in a idle wait loop, when a 
register is being sucessively read.
And if so, how the wmb() example in "Linux Device Drivers" 
(
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch08.html#t1
) can be explained? The 
"Bus-Independent Device Accesses" 
(
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/documents/kdoc/deviceiobook/x44.html
) also 
refers what you suggested, but it also mentions the use of memory 
barriers. So how and when should they be used?
