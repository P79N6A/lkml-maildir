Because if the drive spoke GigE instead of IDE or SCSI ribbon cable, and
ran Linux, then it's effectively a standalone Linux box.
Imagine hot swappable web server hard disk. Plug your disk straight into
the switch, telnet in, configure apache, upload content, done.
I believe it's possible, but I think Larry's estimates of 50% extra cost 
($200 -> $300) are off the wall. The Itsy shows you can make Linux boxes
small enough, but the pricetag (several thousand $) also shows that it's
economically impractical.

Yup. 100mhz Pentium and motherboard is literally $50, including case and
NIC and RAM. Shove a $200 disk inside and I effectively get exactly what
Larry's talking about (hot swappable ethernet interfaced disk drive) but
my version is a bit bigger. Space doesn't concern me. Dollars do.
