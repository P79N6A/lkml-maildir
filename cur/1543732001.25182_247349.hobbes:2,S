Not really as far as I can tell. It isn't a disk any more, its a storage
appliance on a funny connector. It already knows a lot about retries
internally as well as rewriting blocks with high ECC error
count. In fact you actually have to issue a different command to do 
read/write without retry.

It probably should be smarter about error strategy here. You can use
hdparm to control some of this in the IDE case but not enough.
