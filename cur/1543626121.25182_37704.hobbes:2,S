Is this a good default?
IMHO you usually would not want to execute stuff off NTFS, and
if you do you can always just explicitly invoke using wine like:
`wine /ntfs/lookout.exe`
To have all files executable breaks stuff like:
midnight commander (won't open executable files)
ls colorizing
shell tab completion
...
see:

I think the default should be
rx for directories and r for files
