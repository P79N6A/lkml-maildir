Hi,
Does anyone have experience trying to run a 2.4.0-test9 kernel on an AMD ELAN
SC520 based board ? (More specifically the Microspace MSN586SE). It resets
a few milliseconds after starting the kernel. It seems to always reset after
the same amount of time, independant from the code being executed. 2.2.17 works
fine. I didn't try other 2.4.0 versions yet. 
Thanks,
Peter.
