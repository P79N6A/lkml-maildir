My current series of patches is for the ioctls that use a
structure with dev_t field. If someone has time to burn,
or has automated tools that can identify these, that would
be good.
There is a double audit: find these ioctls, and then find
the userspace tools that use them.
For example, struct umsdos_ioctl has twice dev_t followed
by padding. Probably these should become unsigned longs.
I'll send a patch later tonight.
Is it used anywhere? That requires detective work.
It is used by the utilities udosctl (a useless demo utility),
umssync and umssetup. I do not know of any others.
No doubt people will tell me what I overlooked.
Less conservative people will tell me that umsdos has to
be killed entirely.
In old posts and other letters I have mentioned some more ioctls.
The list is not long but they have to be examined one by one,
and in some cases correspondence with authors/maintainers
is required.

There is no hurry. These changes are just editing a few lines
in kdev_t.h. I tend to prefer 64 bits, like hpa.
Maybe I should send another patch tonight, just for playing.
