Would making use of depmod data be a step in the right direction?
ie nic driver calls extern function (e.g. pci_enable_device())
and therefore must depend on module which provides that function.
My guess is this probably isn't 100% sufficient to replace all initcall
levels.  But likely sufficient within a given initcall level.
My main concern are circular dependencies (which are rare).

Isn't already? :)
I thought parallel PCI and SCSI probing on system with multiple NICs and
"SCSI" storage requires udev to create devices with consistent naming.
