I didn't test vanilla, but i still have:
psmouse.c: DualPoint TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
psmouse.c: DualPoint TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 - driver resynched.
in -mm (2.6.16-rc6-mm1).
As I cannot reproduce it at will, it is hard to capture useful debug
info (it usually happens once a day).

Benoit
