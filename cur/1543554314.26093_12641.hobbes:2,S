That is the slow path of the spinlocks needed for fine grained SMP 
locking. Not really surprising that that it bloated a bit, given all
the locking work that went into 2.4.
From looking at my UP configuration (where vmlinux's text segment has bloated
by about 500K between 2.2 and 2.4) there are no obvious big pigs, just lots of 
small stuff that adds together.
