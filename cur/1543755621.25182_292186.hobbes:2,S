When I run "sleep `yes`" under bash, all of swap space is filled,
and then bash says "realloc error ..." and exits.
No kernel problem, no bad bash problem.
If you do not run vm overcommit mode 2 then probably your bash
will be killed by the OOM killer, and if you are unlucky some
other stuff might be killed as well.
Concerning the SCSI errors, looks like you might have disk problems.
Bad blocks in your swap space. Recheck the disk.
