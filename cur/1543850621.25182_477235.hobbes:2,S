You miss the point.
They _wouldn't_ be nested.
The "allow_parallel()" and "wait_for_parallel()" calls would be at some 
top-level situation (ie initcalls looping).
Nobody else than the top level would _ever_ use them. Anything under that 
level would just say "I want to do this in parallel" - which is just a 
statement, and has no nesting issues in itself.
The whole notion of "I want to do this in parallel" is basically 
non-nesting. If something is parallel, it's by definition not ordered, and 
thus nesting cannot make sense. All the "ordered" stuff would be either 
done without using "execute_in_parallel()" at all, or it would be ordered 
_within_ one thread that is executed in parallel.
