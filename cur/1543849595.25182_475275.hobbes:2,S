You don't need SMP - we have sleeping sections here, so even threads on UP 
can trigger it. 
Now, to trigger it you need to have
 - virtual indexing not just by  address, but by some "address space 
   identifier" thing too
 - (in practice) a big enough cache that switching tasks wouldn't flush it 
   anyway.

Well, if you can re-create the performance numbers (Ralf - can you send 
the full series with the final "remove the now unnecessary flush" to 
Davem?), that will make deciding things easier, I think.
I suspect sparc, mips and arm are the main architectures where virtually 
indexed caching really matters enough for this to be an issue at all.
