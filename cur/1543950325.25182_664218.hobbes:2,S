The information here should be in Documentation/ABI/ right?
I still don't see how changing these permissions within the kernel is
going to affect anything outside of it, nor why you want to be tracking
this within the kernel itself.
What's wrong with just having different /dev trees for the different
containers?  That would not require any kernel changes, and you don't
have to write a tool to be sending these odd "mode settings" into the
kernel.
