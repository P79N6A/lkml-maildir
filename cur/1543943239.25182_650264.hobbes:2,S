That makes some sense. Currently you have:
	if ALIGNMENT_TRAP || !CPU_CP15_MMU
	source "drivers/mtd/Kconfig"
	endif

We can certainly improve the behaviour later, it's true -- it's not the
end of the world if we continue to have the whole of the MTD layer
turned off on platforms with alignment problems for now.
But still, it's HAVE_UNALIGNED_ACCESS which we want to depend on, not a
newly-invented HAVE_MTD. And there are other places we really ought to
be depending on HAVE_UNALIGNED_ACCESS too.
