N3510, 60gb sata model.  2.6.14,2.6.15-rc[1..5], with and without mm patches,
and various suspend patches sent to me by people on the linux-ide list.  in
particular, Jens Axboe's libata_suspend.patch and Randy Dunlap's patches here:
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/SATA/2.6.15-rc/,
 plus patches from your site:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.6/.
  every
permutation and combination tried!  all with same result - laptop resumes but
hangs on first disk access.
cheers
