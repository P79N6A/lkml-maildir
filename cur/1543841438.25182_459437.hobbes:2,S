There is one large NFS affecting patch left: namely the one that makes NFS use
FS-Cache.  I presume that requires Trond's agreement to merge.

Hmmm...  Jens wanted my block patches against his tree; you wanted my NFS
patches against Trond's NFS tree.  I guess I should try stacking the whole

Trond, Christoph?  Any thoughts?
