Subject: [patch] Security hole in pre7 (and probably 8) and chown
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

First, the security hole (this is bigger than the chown race condition):
On some clients of a Linux NFS server, it is possible for any user to chgrp
a file s/he doesn't own.  This happens because Linux does not check to
see if a changer of a file's gid owns the file.  Linux's chown always
claims to be changing the uid, too, which causes an ownership check, so
only another OS can trigger this bug (I used NetBSD).
The attached patch's changes to fs/attr.c should fix this (although they
do other things as well).

I've verified that NetBSD (1.3.2) clears the set-id bits on a chown in
all circumstances.  I wouldn't be too surprised if the other BSDs did this
as well.

% I can buy this in the case of non-root files chown'd to root; though not in
% the case of setgid files being chown'd or setuid files being chgrp'd or
I had written the following:
    "I agree with these two.  Clearing the SETGID bit for a uid change or
     clearing the SETUID bit for a gid change is silly."
Then I tried to implement some of this stuff and found that matters are
far more complicated.  There are *four* different ways changing a file's
mode/uid/gid can potentially violate security:
#1:  Setting the S_ISUID/S_ISGID bit for a uid/gid to which one does not
         belong.
#2:  Changing the uid/gid so that the S_ISUID/S_ISGID bit applies to a
         different user/group.
#3:  Setting an execute bit expanding the rights of users to execute
         privileged code.
#4:  Changing the uid/gid so that the execute bit applies to a different
         user/group, thus giving new rights to execute privileged code.
Any of these situations requires re-validating the set-id bits to make sure
the changer has the rights to set them.
Also, see below for some comments on POSIX and The Single UNIX Specification,
Version 2.
It turns out that inode-attribute-change code is pretty screwed up.
In addition to the security hole I mentioned above, there are several
capability-specific bugs in the code.  Non-FSETID-capable users could
set the S_ISUID bit on a file they don't own, chown a file without
loosing the set-id bits, or any of the other issues in #1-4.  It's also
not careful about preserving the S_ISGID bit for directories.
Trying to check for precisely these circumstances was making a complete
mess of the inode_check_ok() code (even for just #1 and #2), so I gave up
on it and switched to a simpler "re-validate set-id bits when the uid,
gid, or file mode changes" rule.
% setuid nonroot files being chown'd to another nonroot user.
I disagree:
#1:  There are accounts other than root that are sensitive (e.g. bin,
        daemon, mail, operator, ftp, qmail accounts, etc.); they need
        protection, too.
#2:  In a capabilities world, no account is more special than any other,
        as far as the kernel is concerned.  Even root isn't special.

% 
% This is true, but this race condition might exist even if the clearing of
% the suid bit is done in the kernel, it requires checking on what the lower
% levels of chown/chmod do for locking.  This might even be
% file-system-specific.
This actually looks pretty good.  The inode updates for local file systems
seem to be done only when holding the global kernel lock, as far as I can
tell.  (But I could have missed a spot, since the lock is held by whomever
started the change: e.g. chown, chmod.)  So they should be OK.
If a networked file system's network protocol doesn't support changing a
file's ids and mode simultaneously, then clearly there isn't much Linux
can do about it.  But then what does one expect when using weird protocols
like that?  Interestingly, NFS seems to do the changes atomically (at least
from my rather cursory look at the code).
There are some POSIX/SUSv2 issues of concern as well.  Linux's current
behavior doesn't quite conform to SUSv2, and the proposed change of only
clearing S_ISUID bit for uid changes (and the GUID bit for gid changes)
conflicts even more.  (I assume some of these are POSIX concerns; I only
have access to the SUSv2 specs on the web.)
SUSv2 has no place for Linux's mandatory locking setting:  it is clear
that the S_ISGID bit must mean "set the egid" when executed, and must be
cleared in a number of circumstances.  Personally, I don't like
overloading the bit like that, but I'll limit myself to pointing out
the problem.  (My patch actually makes this a little worse.)
SUSv2 also insists that changing the user or group must clear *both*
set-id bits for unprivileged (for us this should be non-FSETID-capable)
users.  Personally, I don't see how anyone would end up depending on
this behavior, and I don't have any inclination towards following
standards when they do silly things.  OTOH, it's not *that* silly to
clear both bits.  My patch currently clears only the needed bits,
although I think it might be best to ignore those changes (fs/open.c)
and kill the `&& current->fsuid' tests in chown_common() instead.
I'm getting to really like the idea of a chownmod command (four
arguments: file, uid, gid, mode; change uid/gid/mode simultaneously).
It would nicely bypass the question of what to do with the set-id bits.
Here's a run-down of the patch (it applies to 2.2.0-pre7 and -pre8):
    fs/attr.c:
        Completely reworked inode_change_ok().  I've tested that this does
        the right thing for root and users, but haven't properly tested
        it for how it acts with piecemeal capabilities.  This needs a
        really good eye-balling to make sure the logic is right.
        Killed the extraneous check for the S_ISGID bit in inode_setattr().
        inode_change_ok() already does this and better.
    fs/open.c:
        Changed chown_common() to only clear the S_IS[UG]ID bit when the
        respective [ug]id is changed.  Might not be a good idea from a
        standards-conformance point-of-view.
    fs/ext2/inode.c:
        ext2_notify_change() (currently unused) didn't check to see if
        the ia_attr_flags were valid before using them.  Testing is
        irrelevant.
    fs/fat/inode.c:
        fat_notify_change() was changing the inode without dirtying it.
        Very poorly tested.  Be wary.
    fs/affs/inode.c:
        Eliminated duplicate dirtying of the inode in affs_notify_change().
        Completely untested, but trivial.
