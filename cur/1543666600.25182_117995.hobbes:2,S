In the current Linux kernel, that is.

It is certainly possible (you could mark areas that don't contain currently
used stuff for pageout). It is extremely hairy to do right (just see the
mess with module loading/unloading, which is some of the same stuff, very
tamed).

The cost of doing it right in a monolitic kernel would probably outweigh
the gains manyfold, and require massive redesign for Linux. In microkernels
it is a lot easier to do (but their performance sucks baby elephants
through straws, so they are moot :-)
