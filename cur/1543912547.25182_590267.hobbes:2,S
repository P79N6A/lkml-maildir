Fair enough. That said, you seem to see this even without a corrupt stack.

The unwinder should stop when it sees an invalid frame pointer, and even 
without the push 0 I'd have expected it to be invalid.
But I suspect lguest triggers another thing: you actually make the stack 
start at the *very*top* of the stack area. Afaik, normal x86 does not. A 
normal x86 kernel will start off with a pt_regs[] setup, I think - ie the 
kernel stack is always set up so that it has the "return to user mode" 
information.
And *that* difference may be what triggers this for lguest, even though it 
can never trigger for a "real" kernel.
But your patch does improve the sanity checking of the frame pointer. That 
said, I think the following patch improves it more: does this also work 
for you? (Totally untested, but it looks like the RightThing(tm) to do)
