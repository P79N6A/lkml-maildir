But it is much faster:
ls -l > /dev/null in the same directory copyed to ext2 (about 8000 files)
2.2.9:
0.94user 14.29system
That is readdir on ext2 is sqrt(20)~=4.5 times faster than that on vfat.

dcache has an age, I'd add entries with age depending on entry
position in directory, the farther the entry is from directory
beginning, the less tha age is, e.g. age=1/X/log(P)+Y, where X is cost
of readdir (smaller for ext2, larger for vfat), and P is position starting
from 1. Y would make the relation between normal dentry and readdir-made
dentry.
Of course, this would not apply to future b-tree directories :)

The directory I try contains only long ascii filenames.

Cyclic search looks good. At least it would make better the common
case of readdir/stat. But what if a stupid program sort file name list
before stat's :) (fortunately it is not common)
