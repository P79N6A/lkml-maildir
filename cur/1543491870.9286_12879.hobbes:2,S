Alan, Trond, et al,
A previously-intermittant bug has now become chronic.  Whenever I fire up 
my newsreader (slrn) in a situation where home directory is nfs-mounted, the 
~/.newsrc file disappears on program exit, leaving only the *~ backup.
This is the pertinent log section on the client at the time of program
exit (there are no complaints server-side):
Apr  4 11:26:16 paddy kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 248045 busy, i_count=2, i_nlink=1
Apr  4 11:26:16 paddy kernel: nfs_free_dentries: found hirsch/.newsrc, d_count=0, hashed=1
Apr  4 11:26:16 paddy kernel: nfs_dentry_delete: hirsch/.newsrc: ino=248045, count=2, nlink=1
The client, paddy, is running kernel 2.2.2-ac3 and the server is at 2.2.5-ac2.
Would it be helpful to instrument anything, or is the underlying problem
understood already?
Steve
