I am really sorry about that screwup :(
I can't do too much right now as I am
reading the mail in a batch mode, and
the next time I'll be reading it will
be 24 hours from now.
Attached is a quick fix, which I'll be
testing to death tomorrow at work.
I had DEBUG_PAGEALLOC disabled, so I
haven't noticed that stupid bug while
optimizing my checks...
Let me know how it goes.
