I would summarize:
    - ide=reverse solved certain problems and I am not sure if there are
      users who still need this option
> So, if the option went away, you would not be inconvenienced?
I remember that the disks of the old box are still in a drawer and today,
I will try to reanimate the system and see if grub's ability to map
drives helps to boot the system without ide=reverse.  I'll report later.
