I don't think it's a good idea to keep the network running in the
soft panic. A lot of people have set ups that use ping was a watchdog
and with nfsroot/ip=dhcp ping does work quite well before
mounting root and then the watchdog might not pick up the 
soft panic.
Using a polled keyboard driver after panic seems to be the better
option to me, but if you want softpanic you should probably
at least add a suitable panic notifier to the network stack 
to shut it all down.
