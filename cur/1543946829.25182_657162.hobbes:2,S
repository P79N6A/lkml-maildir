On ARM genrtc has been arbitrary disabled in Kconfig circa 2.6.19 and 
the change to rtc_cmos it is not 100% transparent (ARM Netwinder, Debian).
If I want to use a current (Etch) hwclock binary - I need genrtc with 
/dev/rtc at 10,135, however new rtc_cmos creates /dev/rtc0 at 254,0.
As a result on new kernels hwclock claims that it is not able to access 
hardware.
However upgrading the util-linux package will (sometime in the 
"unstable" future) solve it, so it is not completely broken... Still, at 
the moment - genrtc seems to be a better solution...
Just my $.02...
