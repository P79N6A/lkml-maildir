You can but it's play with fire. It's problem with number of names for one file
(directory here). Upper limit is 65535 (it's unsigned short) but anything above
32768 can trigger subtle bugs ...
P.S. Why you needed such an incredible number of subdirectories in one
derectory ? Trying to make "most slow system for given hardware" or something ?
