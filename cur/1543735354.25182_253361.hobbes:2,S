Hi Stelian, what is to stop the compiler putting, say, "in" in a register
for the process calling __kfifo_get, so that it only sees a constant
value.  Then after a while that process will think there is nothing
to get even though another process is shoving stuff into the fifo and
modifying "in".
By the way, the comment for __kfifo_get has a typo:
+ * kfifo_get - gets some data from the FIFO, no locking version
    ^^^^^^^^^ should be __kfifo_get
Ciao,
Duncan.
