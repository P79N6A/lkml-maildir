You can see the current kernel version by doing uname -a. It is also shown
at boot time.

For iptables you'll need kernel >= 2.4.0, as stated. I don't know if RedHat
has a precompiled rpm somewhere (i don't use RedHat) but i would think so.
You might ask your local RedHat guru ;-).
Other options are:
- build your own 2.4.x (see Kernel-HOWTO, if it's not too outdated)
- use ipchains.
I don't know ipchains enough to tell you how to do it, i don't even know if
it's possible.... But

 may be of
interest to you.
Greetings,
Michel Wilson.
