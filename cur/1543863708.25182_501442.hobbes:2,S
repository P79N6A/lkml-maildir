I have tried the ixgb-1.0-126 driver from intel's web site, with it doing
the same thing, and that looks to be the same as the sf driver.

That loads just fine, and prints out the driver information, and
the copyright.

I *think* have got the line listing the interrupt 1 or 2 times just
before it goes away, I got the serial crossover working to a
laptop and got no extra kernel messages when the driver was loaded
and rebooted the machine, I did see the full kernel bootup so
I know the serial console was working correctly.

The ixgb-1.0.126 driver from Intel's site.
The default driver on 4.4.03 does not support the CX4 board,
but loads just fine, just does not find any cards that it
can drive.   I did confirm that it does not list the PCIID
for the CX4 card.

Yes, that is correct the machine goes to full multiuser (I have
the .ko file moved elsewhere so automatic module loading does
not kill the machine-until it choose to test it), and has been
used for some io test with no issues until the ixgb driver is loaded.
Both machines have been heavily tested with high cpu applications
that verify their results to make sure memory is working correctly
under load.

Ok, I tried that.
I found out that breaks some other unrelated stuff, but loading the ixgb
driver still crashes the machine.

Nothing extra from the serial console, and still locks up with no
msi support.
