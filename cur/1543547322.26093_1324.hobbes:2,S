    We ran 1.2.13lmp for about 1100 days before the box finally got
    turned off - twice around the uptime clock and more
That's must be some kind of unofficial record... I though 400+ days
was pretty neat, but 1100 says is really impressive, especially on a
kernel which has races with jiffie wraps...
