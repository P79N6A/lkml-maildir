First of all, thanx Con for this nice piece of code.
I've been trying in the last few days to backport this new scheduler to
a 2.6.18 kernel.  After a lot of efforts I have finally been able to
compile and run a RSDL patched 2.6.18.8 kernel on a x86_64 arch and
actually my test PC booted 2-3 seconds faster with it compared to a
vanilla 2.6.18.8 kernel.
This patch includes a few other patches from 2.6.19+ kernel:
PATCH 1:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.20.y.git;a=co
mmit;h=ece8a684c75df215320b4155944979e3f78c5c93
PATCH 2:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.20.y.git;a=co
mmit;h=08c183f31bdbb709f177f6d3110d5f288ea33933
PATCH 3:
The patch to get you from 0.26 to 0.28:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/staircase-deadline/2.6.20/sched-rsdl-0.26-
0.28.patch
There might also be other small pieces of code comming from a 2.6.19+
kernel.
Due to the project I'm currently working on, this will, in the next few
weeks, help me out comparing heavy loads on a Debian Sarge/Etch 32/64
platform.  Suggestions on benchmark tools would greatly be appreciated.
Duno if this will be helpfull for anybody but I tought it would be nice
to give it back to the lkml community.
