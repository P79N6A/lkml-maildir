This is certainly one of the most intelligent discourses I've heard
in some time about the subject. Some claim that if it runs inside
the kernel, it's "obviously" a derived work. It really isn't so
obvious at all.
In fact, if the design of a driver, and its implementation requires
a knowledge of only the driver's kernel interface and the hardware
for which the driver is written, it is not derived by any stretch
of the imagination. It's like writing code to interface with any
API. You only need to understand the published interface and not
its underlying principles of operation.
On the other hand, if you were to take an existing driver and
modify it to control some new hardware, then it is obviously
a derived work. The work was derived from the previous driver.
Anything else is not "obvious", but simply conjecture which
may or may not be correct.
