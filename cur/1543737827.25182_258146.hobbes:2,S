Can you check to see if you have an exception at the same time?
Also, please make sure that the first parameter to select() is
the file-descriptor value + 1.  There are things like out-of-band
data that could show up ( MSG_OOB ) under select(). Also, recvfom()
takes a lot of parameters that need to be correct. There is a buffer
length plus a pointer to a socklen_t variable. I've seen people
mess these up and have everything "work" except sometimes...
Cheers,
