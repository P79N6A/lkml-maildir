No, that is already incremented for each ERR, the patch just makes
each and every one of them be printed.  (warning)

Just the interrupt number and hence what device it is used by
(in /proc/interrupts).  However, the 8259 PIC reports spurious
interrupts on IRQ 7.  That's "normal" for it.

No idea, sorry.  I've seen a few problems with riser boards (in
general, mostly timing related), but I don't know anything about
this one.
Did this start happening recently?
Have you tried asking the drives if they have any SMART data
(problems) logged?
