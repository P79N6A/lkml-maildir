While you may wish to do this on an individual basis, this will indeed cause
the megamgr MegaRAID configuration utility to not work.  Please do not
include this as an official patch of the megaraid 1.05 driver.

Subject: Linux megaraid 1.05 driver patch for doing pass-through ioctl's
Hi,
While trying to do some pass through commands using the megaraid 466 card=
,
I got some bizarre error conditions.
The problem was that the megaraid driver just returned the status without
massageing it into linux-friendly values.
Resulting of course in scsi_obsolete errors and requeueing the command.
This patch fixes this by ALWAYS returning DID_BAD_DRIVE on any status
condition for ioctl's on the megaraid host-adapter.
This patch will not influence normal behavior, but it might however have
influence on the megamgr program (which I am not using anyway), that does
do ioctl's on the host-adapter.
 (patch deleted for brevity)
