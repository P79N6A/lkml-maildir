Well, up to "3" it seems usefull on its own. You might attempt to
merge that.
namei.c: you realy don't want to #include in the middle of .c file.
vfs_unlink followed by BUG_ON(error)... that's definitely wrong. In
case of disk error, you might get error on unlink; but you should not
BUG() on that. Perhaps copyfile() should be specified as "may leave
part of copy of target on disk in case of error"?
