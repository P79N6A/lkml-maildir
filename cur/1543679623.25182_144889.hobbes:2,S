The failure rate on accessing an IDE disk via USB 2.0 has been
decreased dramatically with this patch, but I still get IO
errors pretty frequently.
But the real bad part is: If there is an IO error, then I cannot
sync _any_ of my mounted partitions anymore (all SCSI). A 'sync'
gets stuck. All I can do is a power cycle.
Would it be possible to decouple the mounted partitions somehow?
I don't care for the disk with IO error, but a sync should not
get stuck for a valid partition not showing any problems.
