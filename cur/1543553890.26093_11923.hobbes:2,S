That seems to be the place for Andrea Arcangeli VM patch. Get it at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.16/mm-fix-
*
Or even better, get kernel 2.2.17 and
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan/2.2.18pre/pre-patch-2.2.18-18.bz2
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.18pre18/VM-global-2.2.18pre18-7.bz2
and get a 2.2.18-pre18-vm, with USB support included.
There is a 2.2.18-pre20 out, but I have not still checked if
VM-global-2.2.18pre18-7.bz2
works on it. It worked for me in -pre19.
