I find it hard to accept that IDE patch is to blame for that. ;)

If there are no IDE disks in the system there should be absolutely no
change in the functionality.  Please also take a look at the patch (below)
- it adds support for device driver ->resume method and implements it only
for ide-disk driver.
Either bisection went wrong and this is not the "guilty" patch (could you
please check that applying just this patch to -rc4 breaks resume too?) or
something really weird is going on...

[PATCH] ide: HPA detect from resume
From: Lee Trager <lt73@cs.drexel.edu>
Currently when system which have HPA require HPA to be detected and
disabled upon resume from RAM or disk. The current IDE drivers do not do
this nor does libata (obviously it since it doesn't support HPA yet).
I have implemented this into the current IDE drivers and it has been
tested by many others since 7/15/2006 in bug number 6840:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6840
and it has been confirmed to work fine with no problems.
