Hi,
thanks for the good help - the card works really good now. =)
In the following I'll answer to all of your suggestions in this one
mail:
>Does booting with "noapic" on the kernel command line fix your problems?
Yes, it did.
(Although I don't understand why cause I have no smp-system ;-))
>Have you tried the 8139too driver?  This driver is suppose to work
>too.
No, it didn't work in my tests.
>Try the linuxfet driver found here:

I took the driver for "Red Hat Linux 7.3 VT8231/VT8233/VT8235/VT6105
Fast Ethernet Controller" (07/23/2002 Ver 0.9) and compiled it on my
SuSE-8.1 - and it worked really good :)
Additional I found out, that booting with "acpi=off" also fixed the
problem - but this might be a specific problem of the
SuSE-8.1-Kernel.
>The hang could be caused by incomplete tx underrun handling, the

>Could you load the driver with debug=3? For example by adding 'options

To complete the test I'll send the detailed debug-messages tomorrow.
