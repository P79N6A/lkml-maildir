Agreed, which is why I suggested the "spill the _comparison_, not the
actual cc0 register" approach.
That way, if you have to spill, you'll end up at worst with the same code
we already have to have, ie the code will end up something like
	lock ; decl mem
	seta %al		<- spill comparison to %al
	..
	testb %al,%al		<- re-do comparison test later
	jne ..

That sounds pretty ideal - have some way of telling gcc to add a "seta
%reg", while at the same time telling gcc that if it can elide the "seta"
and use a direct jump instead, do so..

I don't see many alternatives. The fact is, asm's end up being used
exactly when gcc simply doesn't know what to do, so gcc doesn't know what
the constraints are either.
