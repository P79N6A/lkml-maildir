Can task classes span an entire cpuset subtree?  I can well imagine that
an entire subtree of the cpuset tree should be managed by the same CKRM
policies and shares.
In particular, if we emulate the setaffinity/mbind/mempolicy calls by
forking a child cpuset to represent the new restrictions on the task
affected by those calls, then we'd for sure want to leave that task in
the same CKRM policy realm as it was before.
