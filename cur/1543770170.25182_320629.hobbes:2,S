Well ... best of luck.  Given the problems incurred doing this for
aic7xxx (mainly in initial inquiry and domain validation, one of which
is outstanding still) it's not going to be easy.
Large segments of the aic79xx driver are identical to the aic7xxx driver
except that all the functions being ahd_ instead of ahc_, so you should
just be able to mirror quite a lot of the aic7xxx updates.  However, you
need to include a large number of rather nasty u320 parameters in the
SPI transport Class (and make sure they're coupled correctly) to get
domain validation to work ... the transport class has also only been
tested on speeds up to u160, so going to u320 will be a first for it
too...
