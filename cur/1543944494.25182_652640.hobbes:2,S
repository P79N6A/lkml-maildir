Guys, you simply have no idea what you're talking about.
Those downstream trees can have done things themselves. They *depended* on 
the state you gave them.
You can't just say "oops, I lied, this is the state you should have used, 
now it's _your_ mess to sort out".
OF COURSE it's what you'd like to use - it absolves you of any and all 
actual responsibility. But dammit, that's not what anybody else wants than 
the irresponsible person who cannot be bothered to stand up for his work!
If you're not confident enough about your work, don't push it out! It's 
that simple. Pushing out to a public branch is a small "release".
Have the f*cking back-bone to be able to stand behind what you did!
