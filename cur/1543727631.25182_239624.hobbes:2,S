Easily fixed. Again, i'm not afraid of fixing driver, few enough of
them care at all at this point. I'll send some patches this week-end
to patrick for his bk tree adding the basic ppc support and renumbering
the PM callbacks, I havne't changed the type yet though, that's a more
tedious work and I'm a lazy guy ;)
I have taken care of various fbdev's too, though for some like atyfb,
I'm blocked until the new rewritten version gets upstream. I'm trying
to get it to -mm at least, news soon on this front.
I'll do other drivers asap.
Ben.
