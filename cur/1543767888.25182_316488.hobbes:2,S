This can break with hard links, bind mounts, etc.  Can you not label the
inode directly?

Did you look at security_task_to_inode?  It's there to help you label the
task based proc entries' inodes directly.

You'll likely regret hardcoding something like that.

It's on the grounds that you shouldn't be poking about vfsmounts as it's 
very core to vfs.  Right answer is to use helpers (or identify a
legimate need for a new helper).  In this case, your code is now
hopelessly racy, and I think would be better served by dealing with the
inode directly.
Hope that helps,
