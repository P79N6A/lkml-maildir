At the first look, I thought this should be lock-less. But I noticed that
memory hotplug(See add_memory()) calls  setup_per_zone_pages_min().
Then, logically, there are 2 interfaces which calls  setup_per_zone_pages_min();
So, we need some kind of lock. 
And setup_zone_migrate_reserve() is also called in this function.
This does more than change value. So I thought zone->lock is good here.

memory hotplug doesn't take lru_lock.
