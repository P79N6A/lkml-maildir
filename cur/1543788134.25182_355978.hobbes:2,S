I think I have to agree; see my post from:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112282837926689&w=2
I've got about 30MB/s from a single threaded version of my
backup code - which seems rather on the low side for
a modern RAID-5; with multiple writers I was seeing sub-5MB/s
but that might be fair if it is seeking everywhere.
I'd be interested to hear how your experiments with jbod'ing them
go.
Dave
