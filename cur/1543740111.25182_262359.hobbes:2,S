comparing netsted irqs to a context switch is a red herring.
nested irqs statistically do good, with long irq handlers vs short irq
handlers. The irq handlers that really know to be extremely quick aren't
forced to re-enable irqs, so they can enforce no-nesting by themself.
Enforcing it globally sounds bad to me.
