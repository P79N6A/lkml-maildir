This is how SysRq-U is SUPPOSED to work :-) It even says so:
-- cut --
SysRq: Emergency Remount R/O
-- cut --
System is STILL mounted and so SHOULD BE changed after reboot. It's good idea: 
SysRq is EMERGENCY tool after all and it's allways good idea to check everything
after emergency :-) SysRq-U will prevent FUTHER filesystem corruption but if
filesystem was ALREADY corrupted when you pressed SysRq-U it can not be fixed
without fsck (and you are NOT supposed to use SysRq-U when there are no possible
curruption: just reboot as usual)...
