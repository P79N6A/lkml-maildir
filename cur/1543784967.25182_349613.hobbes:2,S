If you have access to make hardlinks, you should be able to use
git-relink to do the hard work for you.
From memory:
	git relink my_dir1 my_dir2 ... master_dir
or:
	git relink my-kernel-tree /pub/scm/.../torvalds/linux.git/
(I think that will work - via a bug in my initial attempt to write
git-relink, I look to make sure the path ends in ".git/" not "/.git/".
So the above should work.  I think.)
