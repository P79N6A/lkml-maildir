Hi
I've been poking around the kernel startup code to try and understand 
the sequence of events. I came across something I don't understand and 
which might be redundant.
This is from the 2.6.0 kernel:
In arch/i386/kernel/setup.c the parse_cmdline_early() function, the 
argument "mem=XXX[kKmM]" is parsed.
In arch/sh/kernel/setup.c the parse_cmdline() function also parses 
"mem=XXX[kKmM]"
Could someone please explain this.
I am not subscribed to this list so a reply directly to me would be 
appreciated.
Thanks and a Merry Christmas to everyone
John
