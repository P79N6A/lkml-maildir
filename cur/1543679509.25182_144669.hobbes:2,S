    As a random data point, we're using external USB2 Maxtor IDE
drives (they also have firewire support, but the weird grille on the
back of our server prevented the firewire plug from properly inserting
into the combo USB2/firewire card I bought) for our backups on
2.4.21-rc1-rmap15g, and I was seeing around 10Mbyte/sec when I was
monitoring it the first couple times.  It's also been much more
reliable than the tape solutions we've tried, and it's hard to beat
the price.
