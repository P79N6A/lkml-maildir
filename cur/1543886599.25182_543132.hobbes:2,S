Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
	Gratefully-received recent feedback from CC'd was applied to excellent
effect (and the advice from Matt Mackall about my personal appearance is
best unrequited).
	The patch is split in 5 parts to correspond with the 9 parts Andrew
sent out before, but here's the summary:
1) Sparse (thanks Christoph Hellwig):
    - lguest_const can be static now
    - lguest.c should include "lguest_bus.h" for lguest_devices declaration.
    - page_tables.c unnecessary initialization
    - But the cost was high: lots of __force casts 8(
2) Jeff Garzik
    - Use netdev_priv instead of dev->priv.
    - Check for ioremap failure
    - iounmap on failure.
    - Wrap SEND_DMA and BIND_DMA calls
    - Don't set NETIF_F_SG unless we set NETIF_F_NO_CSUM
    - Use SET_NETDEV_DEV()
    - Don't set dev->irq, mem_start & mem_end (deprecated)
3) Sam Ravnborg
    - lg-objs is deprecated, use lg-y.
Cheers,
Rusty.
