Quite wonderfully, almost.  My monitor (ViewSonic G810) claims it can do
1280x1024@90, but when i boot with that on my x86 box, it comes up at 87.5
or so (and shifted to the left ~1 penguin).  But anyways..

Ah, is this documented anywhere?  I'm sure it'd make some peoples life
easier.

I agree this sounds good.  I just think it's too late to do it now. :)
The vmode/cmode/vesa number stuff should stick around in 2.4 (it's too late
now to remove it) but documented as obsolete, and removed in 2.5.
