Well, original C allowed you to do what you wanted with pointers (I used 
to teach that back when K&R was "the" C manual). Now people which about 
having pointers outside the array, which is a crock in practice, as long 
as you don't actually /use/ an out of range value.

I had forgotten that, the function name was actually a variable with the 
entry point, say so in section 3.11. And as I recall the code, arrays 
were the same thing, a length ten vector was actually the vector and 
variable with the address of the start. I was more familiar with the B 
stuff, I wrote both the interpreter and the code generator+library for 
the 8080 and GE600 machines. B on MULTICS, those were the days... :-D

I had the BCPL book still on the reference shelf in the office, along 
with goodies like the four candidates to be Ada, and a TRAC manual. I 
too expected the next language to be "P".
