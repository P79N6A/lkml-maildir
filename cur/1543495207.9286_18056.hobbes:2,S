I keep getting similar messages from my kernel every couple of days.
This is starting to worry me.
Originally, I had my two drives (10gb fujitsu and 4gb samsung) on the same
chain
as hda and hdb
now the 4gb is hdc (it is the older drive) as I thought that moving it may
help
reduce the problem,
It doesn't seemed to have helped at all :(
Here are the hdparms for hda and hdc.
hdparm -i /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Model=FUJITSU MPC3102AT E, FwRev=6204, SerialNo=01064921

I am assuming that it is the samsung, in that when I moved the samsung on to
the
second chain, the problem report moved with it.
At the moment, this is kernel 2.2.7 vanilla, although any 2.2.x kernel
appears to
produce this (I checked back in my messages logs)
Any light shed on this would be greatly appreciated (especially if CC'ed
direct to me)
Many thanks in advance
Dan
