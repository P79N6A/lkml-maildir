Ok, let me clarify my point-of-view in this discussion: 
I'd expect Linux to get the most out of the hardware. In this case,
transmissions achieving the full 115k2 on hardware that is capable of
that. 
I'd -=like=- this to be achieved. If not, too bad. As long as it works. 
David is in a position where the gaps violate the spec, and he might
get caught in a situation where things actually don't work due to the
gaps.
