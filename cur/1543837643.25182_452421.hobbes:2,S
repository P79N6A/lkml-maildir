Not really, apart from the few things I identified elsewhere (such as the
brelse thing).
It's just that now is the right time for a general spring-cleaning, if we
ever want to do that.

That would drive everyone nuts, I think.  What I would suggest is:
- get ext3 into a ready-to-copy state (merge bugfixes, spring-clean, etc)
- do the big copy-n-rename operation in Linus's tree.
- run a quilt or git tree against the resulting Linus tree.
