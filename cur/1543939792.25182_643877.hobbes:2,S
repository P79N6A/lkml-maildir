Near the end of the build this appears:
  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms2.S
  AS      .tmp_kallsyms2.o
  LD      vmlinux.o
  MODPOST vmlinux.o
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text.head+0xe4): Section mismatch: reference to .init.data.2:trampoline_level4_pgt (between 'ident_complete' and 'secondary_startup_64')
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text.head+0xeb): Section mismatch: reference to .init.data.2:trampoline_level4_pgt (between 'ident_complete' and 'secondary_startup_64')
  LD      vmlinux
  SYSMAP  System.map
What does this mean?
The build finishes and the machine has been running for about 50min.
