Ok, to fill in for just this bit, the domain covering user space mappings
always remains in "client" mode, so page protections are always checked.
PAGE_NONE does not have the "user" bit set, so both user space accesses
and ldrt/strt instructions will be unable to access the pages, which is
the desired behaviour.
However, plain ldr and str instructions will access the page, but
get_user/put_user doesn't use them, and copy_from_user/copy_to_user
are carefully crafted to ensure that we hit the necessary permission
checks for each page it touches on the first access.

Ok.

Ok, this could work, but there's one gotcha - TASK_SIZE-4 doesn't fit
in an 8-bit rotated constants, so we need 2 extra instructions:
__get_user_4:
	mov	r1, #TASK_SIZE
	sub	r1, r1, #4
	cmp	r0, r1
4:	ldrlet	r1, [r0]
	movle	r0, #0
	movle	pc, lr
	...

LS = unsigned less than or same.  LE = signed less than or equal.  You
need the unsigned compare because addresses are unsigned.
