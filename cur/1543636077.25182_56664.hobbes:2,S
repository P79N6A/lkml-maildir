Al,
If I can get 1-2 syscalls for the Topo API, and 1-2 for the Membind API, I'll 
gladly make the changes.  For now, though, prctl() works fine.  If it needs to 
be changed at some point, it can be done in about 5 minutes...
As far as the raciness of the get_curr_cpu & get_curr_node calls, that is noted 
in the comments.  Until we get a better way of exposing the current working 
processor to userspace, they'll have to do.  I believe that having *some* idea 
of where you're running is better than having *no* idea of where you're running.
