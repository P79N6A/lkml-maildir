Well it seems I am one of those users who is bit by the resume bug. I
was wondering why no developer has replied to my
bug(
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6840
) even though many
users have. Id try to fix it myself but Ive never done kernel hacking. I
haven't posted on the linux suspend lists because I talked to one of the
suspend2 developers who told me that the problem was with the ide driver
and thus could not help me.
