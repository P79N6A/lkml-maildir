ext2 (on which I did a "tune2fs -j", but then I found out that the
kernel apparently doesn't support ext3). But, see below.

Indeed - can't do so, unfortunately. It could also be an issue
with the RAID-5 configuration (block size and arrangement of the
disks in the array could be less than optimal as suggested by
the ICP BIOS), so I'm in touch with the very helpful ICP support
people as well.

OK, that's quite odd - now I get a reasonable ~55 MB/s whatever I
try (dd, cp), so that must have been my mistake (or due to the
kernel profiling option?).
By the way, I'm having lock-ups with 2.4.13 that I can reproduce
(vi <file on reiserfs partition> ... :q ... "Segmentation fault"
... lock-up - console input still works, but apparently processes
don't get scheduled).
