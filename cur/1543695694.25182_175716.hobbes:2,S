See the rest of the thread.
I think the point is that if that happened, it would be outside the
scope of the solution being suggested, and something more elaborate
such as a battery backed cache is needed if you want to guard against
that situation.
Unfortunately, I think that the re-writing due to a bad sector
requirement is going to occur often enough to make any solution which
doesn't handle it a bit pointless :-(
