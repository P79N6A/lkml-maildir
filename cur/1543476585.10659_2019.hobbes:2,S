*boggle*  And you think *sendmail* is a load problem?  Majordomo is quite 
useless for mailing lists with more than a few hundred users (reduce 
quantities as the number of hosted lists increases), regardless of MTA --- 
question answered.  vger is drowning in inefficient Perl scripts.
I knew there was a reason I don't normally complain about the list 
turnaround....
Anyone want to donate a real list processing suite to DaveM?  :-/
