I'm not a hacker, but I think it's a good thing to move to CML2.  I've
tested it and it's got some nice features.  The Python issue I don't
think is too onerous to require of people.  And wasn't there someone
out there porting CML2 to straight C code?
Why are people so wedded to the CML1 language spec anyway?
