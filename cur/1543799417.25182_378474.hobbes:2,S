I still believe the only _right_ *workaround* is
http://bugme.osdl.org/attachment.cgi?id=6006&action=view
I'll take a shot at rediffing it against recent kernels in a couple of
hours (unless someone beats me to it).
acpi=strict will work until a suitable patch is merged.
Note: it's still a workaround, to properly fix this we need to make ACPI
interpreter behave predictably, as written in
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5067#c6
 -- I believe I still haven't
heard from Robert Moore on the feasibility of such a solution.
Please also see
