Bill,
We will only have to go through the while loop in rare cases where main 
thread has done pthread_exit() before other threads (and hence it's task->fs 
is null). Also, even in most such cases, the very first iteration through 
the while loop  will get us the 'fs' pointer, so we won't have to loop 
through all threads. So I think this won't have scalability problem. Am I right?
Thanks,
Sripathi.
