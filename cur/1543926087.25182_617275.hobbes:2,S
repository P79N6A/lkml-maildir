No, eventhough return instances are chained in an order, order of execution of 
return handler entirely depends on which process returns first(some process may 
return from 2 line of the function and some process may return from last line
of the function). So entry_handler() which gets executed last doesn't guarantee 
that its return handler will be executed first(because it took a lot time
to return).
So only thing to match the entry_handler() with its return_handler() is 
return probe instance(ri)'s address, which user has to take care explicitly 
(Hence I feel sol a) would be nice).
