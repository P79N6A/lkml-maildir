You're right, that reminds me of one of the rather low priority problems
on my list. iprofd in 2.2 has the same problem, so I suppose there's
nobody using it at all. Your patch looks fine, however I'ld prefer to rip
out support for these ioctls completely. If one really needs it, one can
achieve the same effect entirely from user space anyway. Even with your
patch the current solution is not portable across 2.2 / 2.4 and therefore
not acceptable as-is.
