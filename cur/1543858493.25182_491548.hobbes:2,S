Thanks for all you comments! They helped a lot.
The meaning for some keycodes is still missing, though:
* KEY_ARCHIVE, KEY_FILE, KEY_DIRECTORY - What's the difference here?
* KEY_DIGITS
* KEY_ISO - somehow related to KEY_KATAKANAHIRAGANA ??? (mapped to same 
scancode in rawmode emulation)
* KEY_MODE
* KEY_QUESTION - what's the difference to KEY_INFO and KEY_SEARCH?
* KEY_SCREEN - switch between 4:3 and 16:9 ???
