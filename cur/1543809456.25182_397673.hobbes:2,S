Yeah, sounds much better to me. However, I am wondering if we can
actually drop the nosave/save cases completely. Wouldn't we get the same
semantics by letting uid/gid specify the default id and make the ignore
case look like we're always reading -1 from disk, and never writing out
any ids? So as a desktop user, you mount with "uid=", "gid=", and
"force" passed as mount option and it works as expected.
