Thanks Alan.
I think that it shouldn't be too big a problem - maybe just using
serial8250_register_port() and serial8250_unregister_port() instead
of register_serial()/unregister_serial(), and changing the structure.
The key thing is that port.dev should be set appropriately and the
relevant calls to serial8250_suspend_port/serial8250_resume_port
be made (or port.dev should be NULL if no power management is
expected - in which case it may be managed as a generic platform
port.)
Also, port.uartclk must be set, and since this is an add-in card,
it should not be using BASE_BAUD but the clock rate for the UART
on the card itself.  (BASE_BAUD being an architecture defined
constant has no business being used in connection with add-in
cards with on-board UART clock generators.)
I hope the above is useful, thanks.
