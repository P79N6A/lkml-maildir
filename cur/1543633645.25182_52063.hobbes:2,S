  You might try Alan Cox's ac kernel.  2.4.19pre10ac2 seems to work bit
better on the Promise controllers for me.  You will need to patch in
2.4.19pre10, and then 2.4.19pre10ac2.

PS- What of the PDC options are you using?  I generally enable the
following:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y
CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST=y
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE=y
  If CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST is on try turning it off.  Or in the case of
the the reverse turn it on.

FYI-  The part right here is fairly important as it tells us what
chipset you are using, and bios settings.
