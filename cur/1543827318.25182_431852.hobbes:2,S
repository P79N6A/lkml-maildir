Because there will be a bit the superblock that the user will have to
explicitly enable in order to get extents, so a new kernel on the
rescue/live CD will no whether or not extents are allowed --- just as
today, you have to explicitly enable hashed tree directory indexing
with the command, tune2fs -O dir_index /dev/hdXXX.
