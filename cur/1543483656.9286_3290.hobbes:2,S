My Intel Orion (quad P6) does this.  But I notice that on a normal cold
boot, it pops thru the POST and jumps into the buslogic bios to do the
normal SCSI stuff.  On a warm reboot, just where it would jump to the 
BUSLOGIC stuff, the screen 'blinks' ever so slightly and it hangs.  I
had written this off as a buslogic issue.  My quad xeon never does this.
But maybe it isn't a buslogic 'thing' at all...
