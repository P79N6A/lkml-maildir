If you're using LILO as your boot loader, I believe you can put a line
in /etc/lilo.conf to sort this out - something like the following to
define /dev/hdb as having 19876 cylinders, 64 heads and 63 sectors:
	disk = hdb,19876,64,63
I'm not sure if the syntax is right as I don't have the relevant
documentation to hand, but it's something along those lines.

It's a good program, but still in the early stages of development. You
may wish to report this problem to RedHat's Bugzilla for comment...

That requires that you have a "normal" system handy to plug it
into. However, I believe that the Norton Utilities pack includes a
program that can produce a partition table to match the disk.

As far as I can tell, most DIY systems have either Award or AMI BIOS
chips, whereas IBM use own brand, and Dell appear to use Phoenix BIOS.
