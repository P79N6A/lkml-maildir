It is really unfortunate that the TSC cannot be used for timekeeping on
these machines.  I wrote a simple benchmark that shows rdtsc on
Fernando's box to be insanely fast - 10000 iterations in 68
microseconds.  This was an order of magnitude faster than any other
machine we tested.  Why would they bother making it so fast if it's
useless for timekeeping?
