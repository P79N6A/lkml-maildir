Subject: PCI 2.2 card hangs the system. Need driver writer's advice

Hi folks,
I'm going to tap on the collective experience of lkml
wrt dealing with hardware bugs and quirks.
I have a pair of SMC 2802w PCI 2.2 wireless NICs built
around Prism GT chipset (with ARM processor lurking inside).
There is a Linux driver for it at prism54.org.
I was going to deploy several 11g routers with these cards but
wanted to stress test them first. I fixed one easy bug but now
I've hit another one. Under bidirectional UDP flood + heavy
IDE write activity system freeze instantly and needs powercycling.
It turned out that card does something nasty to PCI bus
when driver does a readl() from PCI mapped space.
Even reset button does not return the card to sanity,
modprobe prism54 and you're toast.
All the details are at
http://prism54.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67
I need to prevent this freeze by reprogramming card
and/or mainboard chipset.
Does anybody seen similar quirks before? Any ideas? Hints?
Does anybody have PDFs about my chipset? Here's the lspci:
