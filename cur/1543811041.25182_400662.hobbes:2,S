That would be nice.  Unfortunately, I'm trying to figure out why my dual
opteron box likes to push the load up to 15 and then hang while doing
i/o to the 3ware 9500S-8 card.  Looks like the load/d-state processes
are caused by a whole lot (well, MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS) of pdflush
processes spinning on base->lock in lock_timer_base(); not sure if
that's intentional or not, but it seems rather odd.  Whether the hanging
is related to the high load remains to be seen.

I don't see why this is a problem.  Other architectures have done this
for ages, without problems.  I suspect most people get their backtraces
from either serial console or logs, as copying them down from the screen
or taking a picture of the panic is a rather large pain.  It seems like
you're penalizing everyone for a few select use cases.
Of course, this is all opinion.
