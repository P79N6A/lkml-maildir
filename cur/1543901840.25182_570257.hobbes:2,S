This seems like a good idea, as long as atomic_dec_and_test() isn't
noticeably more expensive than atomic_dec(). I assume it shouldn't
need to be, since the bus locking operations are presumably the same
in each case.

That's probably a good idea, in conjunction with another part of my
patch for this that frees container objects under RCU - as soon as you
do the atomic_dec_and_test(), then in theory some other thread could
delete the container (since we're no longer going to be taking
container_mutex in this function). But as long as the container object
remains valid until synchronize_rcu() completes, then we can safely
set the CONT_RELEASABLE bit on it.

I think the amount of release synchronization *needed* is going to be
the same whether you have the refcounting done in the subsystem or in
the framework. But I agree that right now we're doing one more atomic
op than we strictly need to, and can remove it.
