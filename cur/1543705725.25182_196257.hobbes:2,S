Subject: [OT] DMA access from a non-bus master PCI device?

Hello,
            I have a PCI device that cannot be a PCI bus master (only a 
PCI target). For some reason it has a DMA controller. Since it can't be 
a bus master I can't initiate DMA transfers from this PCI device to 
system RAM.
My question is, can we use the motherboard's DMA controller to perform 
this transfer? In some of the documents that I got in the web 
(
http://www.pcguide.com/ref/mbsys/res/dma/func.htm
), it is mentioned 
that the 8237 DMA controller that comes with standard motherboard 
chipsets, can only be used for DMA transfers over the ISA bus.
Any comments are welcome.
Regards,
-Romit
