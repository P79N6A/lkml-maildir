Write the code.  Then come back and tell me it "isn't that hard".
Let me make this clear: I refuse to include any solution which doesn't
protect against accidental, as well as deliberate, corruption.  This
means your "canonicalization" code has to be very, very paranoid about
not trusting the data until the signature is verified.  The current code
does very simple checks then completely trusts the module contents,
especially the section headers: to make signatures worth anything, your
code must not do this.
Here's the level of paranoia required for the simplest case, that of
signing the entire module.  The last Howells patches I saw didn't even
do any of *this*, let alone checking the rest of the module:

Sorry, thought you were CC'd the whole time.  My mistake.
