Subject: Rescan IDE interface when no IDE devices are present

My laptop has only one IDE interface (/dev/hdc), which means there are
no valid IDE block devices which can be used for HDIO_SCAN_HWIF ioctl
to scan for the insertion of my CD-ROM drive.
Are there alternate methods of invoking this ioctl, or for creating an
open filehandle where it can be used?
