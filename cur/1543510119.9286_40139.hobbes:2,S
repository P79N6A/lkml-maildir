I think there is still a bug in a network tulip driver.  I'am running
kernel 2.2.12 on P100 with 48mb of memory and 48 swap. (ip_masq box).
I'am experiencing network freezes from time to time...as the uptime 
becomes bigger they occur more often.  Reloading the tulip module fixes it 
temporarely.  There is no such problem when logged in thru the console, so 
it has to be the network issue.
