The kernel freezes after removing the dongle. There were hcitool running
on the interface connected to the usb port.
After modprobing hci-usb, I insert the dongle in the usb port
of the card reader. Than I run "hciconfig hci0 up" to initialize
the interface and start "hcitool scan". While it was running, I
removed the dongle. The computer froze. Nothing in logs, no network.
Hcitool managed to write some error (sorry, can't remember, will try to
reproduce) before everything died.
The scan hasn't found any devices yet. It didn't reported them, anyway, and
there were none active, afaik.
It is the Gentoo Experimental, running on P4-2.6GHz with active SMT,
preemptible is on.
The motherboard has some i865 chipset. USB uses uhci-hcd, bluetooth is
hci-usb. The dongle was inserted in the free port of an usb2-compatible
hub/card reader.
Hcitool is from bluez-utils 2.5, xfree also was running, mouse froze.
The dongle works with a nokia7650 phone (it connects and exchanges some
data, at least) otherwise.
I do not really know what kind of usb/bluetooth this dongle is. Just a
small square blue thing with a green led in a corner.
