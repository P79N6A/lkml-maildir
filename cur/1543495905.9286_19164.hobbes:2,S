The file include/linux/lp.h seems to have code in it, related to wait
queues, that should be available only to the kernel, but is not hidden
from user-space programs.
In my case, util-linux-2.9r failed to compile until I made the change
shown in the patch below (thanks rgooch).
Note, I am a beginner at this (my first post to this list!) - the
patch included below worked for me but is PROBABLY NOT CORRECT. I am
posting here so the appropriate maintainer can check it.
Patrick.
