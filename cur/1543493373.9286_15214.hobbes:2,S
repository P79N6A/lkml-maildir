what is the job of chipset_init in comparison to the netcard probe? 
What I can imagine is that netcard_probe checks if the hardware is there
in the first place. But of cause the Hardware should be initialised,
too, in that process, shouldn't it?
chipset_init would be used to reinitialisie hardware which needs to be
reset for some reason.
