Martin. the point was that pages
which are in the hold/cold lists are technically free.
However we keep them stable.
When the hot/cold list is spilled back to the buddy allocator
we make them volatile in buld (i.e. through the array).
So we only build the array for the duration of the bulk-release
to the buddy allocator (and potentially the other way as well).
Hence there is no "state" to maintain or track for the array.
Pages in the hot/cold lists remain stable.
This would not any of the problems you described as long as we hold
the lock for the hot/cold list during buld-volatile.
I know we did this once. I think we "discarded" the idea
in order to have as many pages volatile as possible.
But this design should be quite easily added and the architecture
can choose whether to be aggressive about this or do it in bulk.
