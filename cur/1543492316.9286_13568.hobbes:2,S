The IDE spin-down is performed by the IDE disk *hardware*, not the
driver.  The IDE drive simply notices that it has not heard any commands
in XX seconds, so it spins down.  If it receives a later command, it
spins up, then processes the command.
With SCSI, the driver must figure out that it hasn't sent any commands
to a device lately, and then send a command to spin-down the drive.  The
drive will then report errors ("not ready") if any further commands are
sent, so the driver must know that it has spun-down a drive, and spin it
back up if more commands need to be sent.
Thus, spin-up/down code complicates the driver for a rather small gain.
