Hello!
> Which was the other problem? 
Another problem was that we may have up to 2*max_files unix sockets:
not-yet-accepted ones are not associated with files/inodes.
We could limit number of unix sockets by max_files,
but it is still not complete solution: max_files may be decreased.
Using list is always OK, however it also requires reviewing
af_unix.c: f.e. pending socket destruction must be blocked
while gc is running.
