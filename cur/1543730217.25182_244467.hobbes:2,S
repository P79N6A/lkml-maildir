Thanks! I did less /var/log/messages, and got the unknown symbols
Unknown symbol __divsf3
Unknown symbol __fixsfsi
Unknown symbol __subsf3
Unknown symbol __floatsisf
Unknown symbol __mulsf3
Unknown symbol __gesf2
Unknown symbol __addsf3
However, I don't know what those symbols are :( I am a bit worried that 
maybe I've done something that is not supported by the kernel, like 
left-shift 16 bits of an int, or floating operations.
Any hints?
Thanks a lot!
