John,
It looks like the only clocksource available on David's box is
"jiffies" although the processor shows that it supporst tsc and PM
timer is enabled and I think that this is what causes keyboard
stuttering in X. See 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7291.
I believe clocksources is your turf, could you please take a look at
this.
Thanks!
