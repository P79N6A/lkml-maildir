Subject: APM suspend on 2.6.0-test9 causes Toshiba 470CDT laptop to hang after resume

When I suspend and later resume on this laptop it looks like 
everything that involves the disk breaks.  For example, when I 
tried this after resume:
dmesg > dmesg.log
sync
it hung on sync. The kernel seems to continue working, for 
example I can scroll up, but anything I try to run hangs. USB 
seems to break as well, if I connect a card reader after resume 
there's no kernel messages, and its LED doesn't light. Here are 
some messages I copied:
(apm --suspend)
hdc: start_power_step(step: 0)
hdc: completing PM request, suspend
hda: start_power_step(step: 0)
hda: start_power_step(step: 1)
hda: complete_power_step(step: 1, stat: 50, err: 0)
hda: completing PM request, suspend
ohci_hdc 000:00:0b.0: suspend D4 --> D3
ohci_hdc 000:00:0b.0: suspend to 3

(resume, apm --suspend not returning, Ctrl+C works to abort it)
