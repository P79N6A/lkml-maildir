This is impossible to do in a device-independent way. Only the drivers know
how they can recognize each other. And if you're meaning the b/l driver will
register the match function with the core, that's very similar to the solution
I've described in my earlier messages.

I agree but my word means nothing.
Speaking of your patch, I don't like the lcd_power_names array. The reason for
the 0-4 power status was to match that of VESA power states (0..4,
intermediate values mean intermediate power states, whatever they mean for
concrete devices). Besides, it makes end-user usage more complex (instead of
just specifying a number in the 0-4 range you now have to *know* you have to
specify "full off" and alike). Also it doesn't handle backlight, only LCD.
