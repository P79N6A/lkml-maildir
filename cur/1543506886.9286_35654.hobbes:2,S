We just had a launch of a very high profile web site which handles about
1000 simultaneous requests per second.  We were using the 2.2.5-22 kernel
that is built by Redhat.
I noticed that sometimes, after changing some resource limits via ulimit,
and then restarting apache, I would get all accross my machine "net_timer
expired reason 0 unknown", and the machine would just keep printing it and
I wouldn't be able to recover it.  It would not respond to anything once
this starts.
Does anyone know what this could be?  Could it be from running out of
processes?  Could it be from having ulimit set higher than what is in
tasks.h?
Brian
