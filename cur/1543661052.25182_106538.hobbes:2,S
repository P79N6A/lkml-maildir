At least in theory, any pnp device could be hotplugged.  Of course it depends on 
which protocol the ide drive is represented by.  ISAPnP is completely static
where as PnPBIOS, and potentially ACPI in the future, support docking stations and
other removable pnp devices.  Support for PnP hotplugging is very limited at the 
moment however it is best to design drivers around this feature so we don't have
a mess when PnP hotplugging is finally used.  Also if a pnp protocol was presented
in a removable module format, the protocol may want drivers to detach from its
devices upon module unload.  Are there any other hotpluggable ide devices and if
so how are they handled?
Also any additional comments?
Thanks,
Adam
