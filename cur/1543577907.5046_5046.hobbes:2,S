I don't argue that ifconfig shouldn't be fixed, but the hash speeds up
ip by about 2X too.  Is that not useful enough?  ip seems to be implemented
pretty efficient, so if the hash helps it significantly then maybe it
can help other efficient programs too.  Notice that it is the system
(ie kernel) time that stays remarkably flat with the hash + ip graph.
