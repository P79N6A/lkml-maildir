LDPC codes[1][2] have been replacing Turbo code[3] with regards to
communication links and we have been seeing that transition. (maybe
helpful, came to mind seeing the mention of Turbo code) Don't know how
weaver compares to LDPC, though found some comparisons [4][5] But
looking at fault tolerance figures, i guess Weaver is much better.
