I distinctly recall it counting, but since I don't have a 2.4 tree
handy, I'll refrain from saying "did _too_" ;-)

The main difference I see is...

With 2.4, there was only one flush thread.  Same load, different
loadavg... in this particular case of one user task running.  IIRC, if
you had a bunch of things running and running you low on memory, you
could end up with a slew of 'D' state tasks in 2.4 as well, because
allocating tasks had to help free memory by flushing buffers and pushing
swap.  Six to one, half a dozen to the other.
