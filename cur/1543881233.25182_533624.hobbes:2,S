A lot of other things matter.  Things like a willingness to
maintain the code after it gets merged, or at least turning
the code into something the community is willing to maintain
if the original developers stop maintaining it.

Namesys kind of abandoned reiserfs after work on reiser4
started.  Taking in a new code base on such a track record
is not a good idea when the code is not in a shape where
the community wants to maintain it.

You basically have three options:
1) keep patching every time you upgrade the kernel
2) use another filesystem
3) become the new reiser4 maintainer and turn the code
    into something that Linus is willing to accept
