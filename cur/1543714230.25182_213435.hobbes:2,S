I have a problem using kgdb.
My test kernel is 2.4.24 and I am using the kgdb patch
linux-2.4.23-kgdb-1.9.patch downloaded from kgdb.sourceforge.net.
The problem is that whenever I break at a function [say netif_rx() in a
net driver interrupt routine] and step into it, the "bt" (backtrace)
command never shows the entire stack trace - it only shows the current
function. Moreover, the "up" command does not work. Could anybody tell
me what could be the problem?
Regards.
