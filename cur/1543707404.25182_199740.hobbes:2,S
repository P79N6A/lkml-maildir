Hi,
Consider this:
- both CONFIG_EISA and CONFIG_PCI are defined
- hp100_isa_init() returns an error (ie. -ENODEV)
- eisa_driver_register() and pci_module_init() are called
- hp100_module_init() returns -ENODEV,
  module fails to load, so hp100_module_exit() is not called
- &hp100_eisa_driver and &hp100_pci_driver are still happily
  registered with sysfs
This is far too common mistake... :-(
