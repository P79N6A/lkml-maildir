Just an idea : from what I've read, the problem (port 80 hanging) only occurs
on 'modern' machines... So why not :
 - use port 80 for old CPUs (PII, PIII) where it has never really been
   a problem,
 - use the cpu->family to do a best match for CPU freq
thus we could avoid increasing boot time too much...
