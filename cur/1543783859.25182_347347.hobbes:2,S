Make no mistake: Our mission at SmallCap-Investors is to claw our way 
through the thousands of underperforming companies out there 
to find the golden needle in the haystack the micro-cap DIAMOND 
that can make you rich. More often than not, the stocks we profile 
show a significant increase in stock price and sometimes in days, 
not months or years.
Do this often enough, and your portfolio can double, 
even TRIPLE (!!!) in value.
