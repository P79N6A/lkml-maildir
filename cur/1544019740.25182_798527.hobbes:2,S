I am sorry, although it is not carefully crafted. The function random()
is causing my problem. I currently have no real data, so I tried to make
some random utilization and data.
Without the random() function it works even with 80MB of data and I get
great results.
./ThreadSchedulingIssue 1 10485760 8 312
All threads finished: 309 messages in 29.369 seconds / 10.521 msg/s
schedtool -a 1 -e ./ThreadSchedulingIssue 1 10485760 8 312
All threads finished: 312 messages in 44.284 seconds / 7.045 msg/s
It does not even regress with more then two threads. 
./ThreadSchedulingIssue 2 10485760 8 312

./ThreadSchedulingIssue 4 10485760 8 312
All threads finished: 309 messages in 28.021 seconds / 11.027 msg/s
With small amounts of data the speed on two core is even doubled.

--------------
Perhaps it is as it should be, but when I run the test (without
random()) with 2*8 threads, it uses ~186 of the cpu, while an instance
of "bzip2 -9 -c /dev/urandom >/dev/null" gets only 12%.
