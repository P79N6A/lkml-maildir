Hi Andrew,
I have been asked for a cmpxchg_local implementation by Christoph Lameter so he
can use it to accelerate the slub allocator.
On some architectures, where cmpxchg is nothing more that a simple save/restore
interrupts surrounding the cmpxchg non atomic ops, I remove the code and make
them use the new "generic" version.
cmpxchg_local and cmpxchg64_local are made available on all architectures in
these patches. They use the best primitive known, either an atomic operation or
save/restore interrupts.
Mathieu
