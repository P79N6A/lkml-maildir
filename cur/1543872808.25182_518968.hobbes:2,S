Well, what I was aiming at was a generic mechanism that can handle
"namespaces", "metered classes" and other ways of providing
per-task-group behaviour. So a system-call API doesn't necessarily
have the right flexibility to implement the possible different kinds
of subsystems I envisage.
For example, one way to easily tie groups of processes to different
network queues is to have a tag associated with a container, allow
that to propagate to the socket/skbuf priority field, and then use
standard Linux traffic control to pick the appropriate outgoing queue
based on the skbuf's tag.
This isn't really a namespace, and it isn't really a "metered class".
It's just a way of associating a piece of data (the network tag) with
a group of processes.
With a filesystem-based interface, it's easy to have a file as the
method of reading/writing the tag; with a system call interface, then
either the interface is sufficiently generic to allow this kind of
data association (in which case you're sort of implementing a
filesystem in the system call) or else you have to shoehorn into an
unrelated API (e.g. if your system call talks about "resource limits"
you might end up having to specify the network tag as a "maximum
limit" since there's no other useful configuration data available).
As another example, I'd like to have a subsystem that shows me all the
sockets that processes in the container have opened; again, easy to do
in a filesystem interface, but hard to fit into a
resource-meteting-centric or namespace-centric system call API.
