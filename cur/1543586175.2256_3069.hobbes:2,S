Parameters for retransmission of a trame specified in Q922. t200 is the
timeout value and n200 the maximal number of retransmissions. They can
be negocied and default to t200=1,5s, n200=3.

Ok.

No protocol I know. Sometime one just want to verify how a driver performs
when he receives badly fscked data. One can live without it.
