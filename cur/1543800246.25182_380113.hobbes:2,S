Something really fishy is going on here: 
That 9 ms latency seems to be really *idle* time!
* If the box is idle, I get that trace almost immediately, and
almost always with close to 9 ms (system clock is 100 Hz, 
i.e. 10 ms tick period).
* If the box is 100 % loaded, I don't get that trace. I get
different traces from different processes, mostly shorter than
9 ms.
* If I load the box with work at regular intervals 
and idle time in between, I get traces
identical to the 9 ms idle trace, but consistently shorter.
If I throw a flood ping with 1000 pkt/s against my box, the idle
trace shows up with 800 or 900 microseconds, i.e. the idle time
between packets.
Now, is the tracer wrong, or has the idle time a wrong status?
By the way, I had one trace today where the cat /proc/latency_trace
itself showed up:
      \   /    |||||   \   |   /           
     cat-3129  0D...    1us!: preempt_schedule_irq (svc_preempt)
     cat-3129  0.... 5502us+: rt_up (l_start)
     cat-3129  0D..1 5511us+: check_raw_flags (rt_up)
     cat-3129  0...1 5514us+: rt_up (l_start)
     cat-3129  0...1 5518us : sub_preempt_count_ti (rt_up)
What's happening in those 5 ms?
