In my last message I sent a patch that I thought fixed the problem.
I made a mistake in my testing.  It turns out that my patch doesn't
have an effect on this problem.  What I discovered was a workaround: 
If I rmmod ehci-hcd and then modprobe it back in, usb 2.0 it works. 
That's what I did when I tested my patched version, so I mistakenly
thought it was my patch that fixed it.
So it seems that there is something that happens when the ehci-hcd
shuts down that helps initialize it to work properly.  What could it
be?
