Your kernel sources are buggy.  This function is exported.

This is not a fix - unregister_serial() must not be used with ports
registered with serial8250_register_port(), and in fact
unregister_serial() no longer exists.
You need to find out why your tree doesn't export
serial8250_unregister_port().  Mis-merged patch maybe?
