Subject: [RFC] ioctl(2) return value

In ALSA we use the return value from ioctl as a simple way to return a
positive number to user space (if the return value is less than 0 we got
error, of course)
We got the doubt that this break some unknown standards or some linux
conventions or Linus taste (at a first glance I'm unable to find
precedents inside kernel tree).
I've looked Singe UNIX Specification, Version 2 and there this seems
perfectly acceptable.
I'd like very much to have some feedback to do the RightThing (tm).
The alternative of course would be to add a result field inside struct
passed by pointer to ioctl call.
