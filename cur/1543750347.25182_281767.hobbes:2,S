looks good to me. I think it might make sense to default-enable it for
testing and try it in -mm, to see how acceptable it would be for
mainstream (and for non-x86 architectures)? In theory this should not
break systems that have a perfect IRQ routing setup, and it could make a
crutial difference for systems that have IRQ routing problems. The current
opt-in flag will not give enough testing i believe.
