I think that the functions:
read_suspend_image()
read_pagedir()
swsusp_pagedir_relocate() (BTW, why there's "swsusp_"?)
check_pagedir() (BTW, misleading name)
data_read()
eat_page()
get_usable_page()
free_eaten_memory()
should be moved to snapshot.c as well, because they are in fact
symmetrical to what's there (they perform the reverse of creating
the snapshot and use analogous data structures).  IMO the code
change required would not be so drammatic and all of the functions
that _operate_ on the snapshot would be in the same file.
Greetings,
Rafael
