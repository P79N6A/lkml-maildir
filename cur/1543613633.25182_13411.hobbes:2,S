	IIRC, SUS states that if a fatal error occurred causing the
partial write, that error will be returned on the next write or upon
close().  Thus:
	/* Smart program handles partial writes */
	write(100k); = 50k
	write(remaining 50k); = -1/ENOSPC|EIO|etc
or:
	/* Dumb program doesn't handle partial write */
	write(100k); = 50k
	close(fd); = -1/EIO
