Subject: Overlay ramdisk on filesystem?

I have a feeling that this may be a bit too off-topic, but I'm doing 
some Linux and hardware performance tests, and some of the tests will 
put the hardware into an unstable state which could get memory errors 
which could cause filesystem corruption.
I would like to know how I could overlay a RAM disk over a read-only 
filesystem so that all new files and modified files end up in the RAM 
disk, but old files are read from the disk.  This way, when I reboot, 
the disk reverts back.
Suggestions?
Thanks.
