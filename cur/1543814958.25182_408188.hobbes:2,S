Yes, the bitops need that.
We have a 50-patch series against the bitops code queued up.  It's from
Akinobu Mita.  It consolidates of all the C-coded operations which
archtectures are presently duplicating.  In toto:
 80 files changed, 1271 insertions(+), 4999 deletions(-)
It does include uninlining of the hweight functions, although I note that
include/asm-generic/bitops/__ffs.h remains inlined.  I don't know how many
architectures are using the generic code though.
