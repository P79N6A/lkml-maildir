That's what I thought. Anyone here feel like pursuing that? It is, directly, a 
license violation. :)

Not really. "I threw the source away" violates the license in a very clear 
manner - they are distributing a "work based on the work" without complying 
with the terms of the license under which they gained access to the work. 
However, as I said, I can see some valid reasoning. But its more a part of 
the "Hey, I paid good money for this thing and I can't use it how I want!" 
type of reasoning.

But the change has some massive problems. If dd1 or dd2 was clearly and 
concisely written such that the conditions were not open to a different 
interpretation without creative re-definition of words then changes would not 
be needed. (I'm still working on the version I mentioned - give me a bit, 
writing english in such a way that a lawyer can't twist it to mean whatever 
they are paid to make it mean is difficult.)

I think there was more to it than that, but the point doesn't matter. If the 
license used on contributed code *isn't* completely compatible with the 
license on the project it can't be used anyway. (doesn't the GPLv3 cover 
situations like that?)

Hrm... When I first hit the end of this massive sentence I was really 
confused. Took about five minutes for me to remember that "morally entitled" 
is based on the morals promoted by the FSF.

IMHO RMS and the FSF go about things in the wrong manner. Yes, the goal is 
admirable, but the means by which they are attempting to reach them are not. 
However, I have no connection to the FSF or RMS and thus cannot dictate 
anything. What I can do is try to educate people as to why I have the dislike 
of the FSF and RMS that I do. (and how I can *respect* RMS and the FSF while 
not liking them :)
In this discussion I've tried to point out things that occur that are at odds 
with the text of the GPLv3 (as it exists - the "31/5/2007 'Final Comment 
Draft'). I have also tried to point out that what the FSF and RMS claim is 
the "spirit" of the GPL cannot be conclusively proven to be the same "spirit" 
it had when it was written. When it comes to that somewhat slippery 
term "intent" I think I made my point very clear - ie: the intent of the 
license is what each licensor believes it to be. (meaning my view of the 
intent is no less valid than the FSF's view)
Everyone that has been part of this discussion - my personal code of morals 
will not let me get away without this: "Forgive me if, in the heat of the 
moment, I offended any of you." (it shouldn't need to be said that I've 
forgiven the few people that managed to offend me)
Now - this discussion has been a lot of fun and really kept me on my toes. It 
has been years since I've had a "debate" as lively as this one has been. So 
thank you all for it. Now please, remove me from the CC: list as, IMNSHO, 
this discussion has run its course and come to all the resolution it ever 
will.
