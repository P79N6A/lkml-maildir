We need something more sophisticated. Matrox's hardware has bits
31-16 readable/writable only if bit 0 is set to 1 (ROM enabled; you can
(obviously) set bits 31-16 & 0 in one write). When ROM is disabled, 
bits 31-1 are always read as 0.

It would be nice if it works... For matrox hardware I have to map ROM
over framebuffer (it is solution recommended by datasheet), as there is
no way to get memory range allocated for ROM unless ROM was left enabled
all the time.
