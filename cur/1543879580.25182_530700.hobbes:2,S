These are both tremendously useful. The code is also in rather good
shape so only minimal modifications (for massive_intr.c I'm not even
sure if any are needed at all) are needed to plug them into the test
harness I'm aware of. I'll queue them both for me to adjust and send
over to testers I don't want to burden with hacking on testcases I
myself am asking them to add to their suites.
