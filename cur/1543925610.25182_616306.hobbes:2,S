I always thougt that's a mess... the reason it's done this way is that
Andi Kleen preferred it for some reason at the time. How about trying
to fix it cleanly so that dma_alloc_coherent always gets called rather
than adding a hack to work around a hack? It will require auditing all
of the different x86 dma-ops but I can help with that.
Cheers,
Muli
