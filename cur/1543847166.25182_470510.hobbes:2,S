I think this will do the wrong thing if (bd->type >= PCIXEM).  Maybe it's
OK, but it's not immediately obvious from a quick reading.
I'm quite worried about changes in crufty old drivers like these - if we
break them, the breakage will take a *long* time to be discovered.  Too
late for us to fix them.
Plus a lot of them are just plain badly coded, so extra care is needed to
understand the tricks which they're playing.
