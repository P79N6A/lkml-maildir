RTFRFC. 821, Appendix E, that is. Quote:
         There are five values for the first digit of the reply code:
	.......
            4yz   Transient Negative Completion reply
               The command was not accepted and the requested action did
               not occur.  However, the error condition is temporary and
               the action may be requested again.  .......
	.......
            5yz   Permanent Negative Completion reply
               The command was not accepted and the requested action did
               not occur.  The sender-SMTP is discouraged from repeating
               the exact request (in the same sequence).  .......

Like following the RFCs with Status: STANDARD? Last time I've checked
RFC821 was STD0010 and other parts of said beast (1869, 1870) follow the
rules set in 821,App.E when they describe the possible error codes and
their interpretation.
