4 billion patches could be bisected in 34 boots. Between 2.6.20 and
2.6.21-rc1 there are only:
$ git rev-list --no-merges v2.6.20..v2.6.21-rc1  |wc -l
3118
patches, requiring 14 boots. In general ceil(log(n)/log(2))+2 boots.
Of course, this is a little optimistic because it assumes no additional
breakage occurring at the various bisection points. In any event,
assuming (pessimistically) 10 minutes per build, this is 280 minutes or
4 hours and 40 minutes of build time. I estimate the process should
complete well before Friday of this week, never mind June.
