Ok. One more attempt to be clear.
All the places where get_namespace() is called currently except
in mark_mounts_for_expiry() are safe because they are called in
places where it is guaranteed that they will not race with 
__put_namespace(). 
For example in clone_namespace(), get_namespace() will not race
because the task that called the clone has a refcount on the
namespace and since that task is currently  in the kernel, there is
no chance for  the task  to go away  decrementing the refcount 
on that namespace. 
But the case where the call to get_namespace() is buggy in 
mark_mounts_for_expiry() is because:
it is called in a timer context, and the last process referring
the namespace may just disapper right than.  
 So what I am proposing is:
in automouter, while the automount takes place in 
afs_mntpt_follow_link() increment the refcount of the namespace,
by calling get_namespace(). This call will not race with __put_namespace
because the process that is trying to access the
mountpoint already has a refcount on the namespace and it won't be 
able to decrement the refcount currently. agree?
Now later when the automounter tries to unmount the mount 
call put_namespace() after unmounting. I mean do it in
mark_mounts_for_expiry(). Also delete the call to get_namespace()) 
So the race will not happen at all.
Makes sense? 
That was the easiest part, but the difficult part is how to call
get_namespace() on a forign namespace in do_loopback()?
thinking about it,
