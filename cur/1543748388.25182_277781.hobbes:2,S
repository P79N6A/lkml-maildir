Hi all,
Any objection to me removing the checksumming code from the (i2c) eeprom
driver? Deepak had suggested we should do so a long time ago [1], and I
fully agree with his position. The checksum is application-specific and
verifying it doesn't belong to the kernel-space. The checksumming code
we (optionally) use at the moment only covers memory module EEPROMs as
far as I know, while EEPROMs exposed on I2C/SMBus may be of a variety of
other natures.
