Ok ;-)
So, you are not only speaking about "my" part of duplicated code, right ?
But, just for information, what is the sys_futex64 for, exactly ? Is there a 
plan to have in the future a 64-bit PID ? Because for now, 32-bits futex is 
enough, so... ?
Otherwise, I don't have a "clean" way to avoid this duplication.... :-/
