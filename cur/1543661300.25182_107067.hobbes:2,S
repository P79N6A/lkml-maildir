Hi,
    I'm trying to integrate some tools on a 486-powered cpu board, I don't
really need "High Resolution Timers", but one of the tools would really make
good use of the POSIX API you implemented. I've patch kernel 2.4.20 with the
latest 2.4.20-1.0 hrtimers.
Here comes the trouble.
- Trying to build with High-Res, the kernel won't build
time.c: In function `time_init':
time.c:873: `do_fast_gettimeoffset' undeclared (first use in this function)
time.c:873: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
time.c:873: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [time.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/arch/i386/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
seems like it should try to link "do_slow_gettimeoffset" instead since 486
does not handle TSC, (I'll have to check that..)
- Trying to boot with "PIT-based" high-res support, the kernel lock during
calibration "Calibrating delay loop".
	Same occurs with IOAPIC and TSC ... 
If you have any hint, I'll be glad to hear it.
Thanks
Frank
