Me either, you wouldn't believe.

No, you didn't point out anything. You didn't describe _why_ you
want to change the subsystem. No single reason except "flexibility"
that _no one_ is using.

No, this isn't mine subsystem. I've written most of it, probably.
But now I'm just volunteering to co-maintain it (that is, the person
whom to blame if something goes wrong in power/). I'm also directly
interested in this subsystem, because I have the hardware on which
I'm using it.
But I'm not the last person you can ask to merge your changes. Whole
LKML is hearing us, and if you want to--ask David to push your
changes over me. Or Andrew. Or ask Linus at the last. They're are
much better programmers than I am, so whatever they'll do would be
the right thing. I'll just swallow it.
Though, on the current patches, please stamp my:
Nacked-by: Anton Vorontsov <cbou@mail.ru>
so the history will have written evidence that I did not agree on
the changes, so years later I could reply to the complaints: "Look,
I nacked this code, it wasn't me who checked this in!"
You have another option though: finally show up the user of the
purposed changes. Without single "flexible" word, please. Real,
existent user.
