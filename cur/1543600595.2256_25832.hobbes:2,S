	So, you mean such change:
	if (!key.src)
		key.src = key.dst;
with
	if (!key.src)
		key.src = res.fi->fib_prefsrc ?: key.dst;
	key.dst is != 0, so, we don't need to call FIB_RES_PREFSRC
and inet_select_addr, we prefer key.dst as source.

	Oh, yes, the tproxy ... the connect call should be without bind,
so this soulution is not entirely perfect when "local networks" are
used (on lo) or when the above feature is considered a bug. Agreed for
the next part of the mail... Hm, time to go to netdev
