See the email to kay sievers.  In 2.6.14 following symlinks hit an endless
/sys/block/hda/device/block/device/block/device/block...  This has changed 
since, like much of sysfs, but in the absence of either a spec or a stable 
API there's no guarantee it won't reoccur.

Ok:
Paragraph 1: "It's not stable."
Paragraph 2: "It's not stable."
Paragraph 3: If you really really need to access it directly...
Paragraph 4: DO NOT DO $XXX.
Paragraph 5: Expect it to be mounted at /sys
Paragraph 6: DO NOT DO $XXX.  (Specficially, the way you were distinguishing 
between block and char devices?  Don't do that.  No, we won't tell you what 
to replace it with, keep reading.)
So far, not exactly gripping reading.
Paragraph 7: What a devpath is.  Ok, is it just me or does it say that 
applications shouldn't use the symlinks in sysfs?  Why are they there, then?
Paragraph 8: The kernel has a name for the device.
Paragraph 9: Subsystem is a string.  What it means, we leave for you to guess.
Paragraph 10: Driver is the name of a driver.  (Does this mean a driver is 
currently loaded and handling the device, or that the kernel is suggesting a 
driver based on something like PCI ID, through the kind of mechanism that 
used to be used to request module loading?  Experimentally, it looks like the 
first, which makes sense but isn't specified.  Does something 
like /sys/class/mem/zero or have a driver?  Experimentally, no, it hasn't got 
a device link.)
Paragraph 11: Atributes, and yet more DO NOT DO $XXX.  It took me three reads 
of that to figure out they probably meant "Attributes belong to a device, 
don't confuse the attributes of another device with attributes of this 
device."  (Following _which_ device symlink?)
Ok, back up.  /sys/devices does not contain all the information necessary to 
populate /dev, because it hasn't got things like 
ramdisks, /dev/zero, /dev/console which are THERE in sysfs, which may or may 
not be supported by the kernel (the kernel might have ramdisk support, might 
not).  These things could also, in future, have their major and minor numbers 
dynamically (even randomly) assigned.  That's been discussed on this list.
I'm not trying to document /sys/devices.  I'm trying to document hotplug, 
populating /dev, and things like firmware loading that fall out of that.  
This requires use of sysfs, and I'm only trying to document as much of sysfs 
as you need to do that.  I'm not documenting stuff 
like /sys/devices/system/cpu.
The consensus so far is "the udev implementation is the spec", except I 
watched the udev implementation change rather a lot before I stopped tracking 
it, and saw a number of people complain on this list about things breaking 
when they upgraded the kernel but not udev.
Back to reading the document:

Belong into?

For determining?
What was the original language of this document?

Again, whether they mean "the kernel was not built with a driver that can 
handle this device" or "no driver is currently loaded and handling this 
device".  It _sounds_ like "this device is not supported by Linux", which 
probably isn't what they meant.
> Never copy any property of the parent-device into a child-device.
I note that the only mention made so far of parent-child relationships in 
devices is in terms of "don'ts".  I assume they're talking about how a 
partition can be the child of a block device, and a network controller card 
can be the child of a pci bus device?
Ah, I see.  The next paragraph is on hierarchy, yet doesn't actually explain 
anything, other than to imply that the device hierarchy being fully 
represented there is a dream to be achieved sometime in the future but not 
necessarily the truth with today's kernels, because stuff is still being 
_moved_ into /sys/devices.

So if somebody wants to write code that runs on a current kernel, they have no 
alternative but to look in these three places.  If future kernels want to be 
compatible with current kernels, they must retain these three places as 
symlinks or some such.  Therefore, these three places form an API, and that's 
what I'm trying to document.

So presumably /sys/class/mem/zero and friends will show up under /sys/devices 
at some point, but that path should still find the thing via symlinks.  So 
moving it is an implementation detail irrelevant to documenting an api 
through with /dev can be populated by a userspace application.

So the fact Kay didn't mention /sys/class/block when we talked at OLS is a 
simple oversight.  You know, the type of feedback I was asking for was "This 
is wrong, you should change it to X", rather than "this is wrong, you're 
stupid".  I already _know_ I don't understand every nook and cranny of the 
Linux kernel, and that this is unlikely to change, thanks.  If you were 
wondering why writing documentation is like pulling teeth, and that there 
isn't enough of it, now you know.
Anyway, it seems like the paragraph I quoted can be rephrased "The contents 
of /sys/class/* and /sys/bus/* are interchangeable, and the contents 
of /sys/block and /sys/class/block are interchangeable."  However, this 
implies that /sys/class/block and /sys/block are interchangeable 
because /sys/class/block is part of /sys/class/*...

A) The converted block subsystem isn't in 2.6.22 or any earlier kernel, thus 
software has to be written to use the current /sys/block path to be 
compatible with any kernel actually deployed anywhere today.  And if you've 
got the old mechanism working, what's the advantage of the new one?
B) This is the first mention (by implication only) that the current /sys/block 
might have a hierarchy under it.  The point of this document is obviously not 
to document how it works _today_.  The point of mine _is_.

This paragraph is a big "DO NOT DO $XXX" repeated six times, and I note that 
this link was the reason I made mdev not follow symlinks in the first place.

DO NOT DO $XXX.
Although I am curious about this paragraph.  Not that I'm really trying to 
document this bit, but "You must always request the parent device you are 
looking for by its subsystem value." does not explain HOW to request a 
specific device by its subsystem value.  According to the earlier bullet 
point about "subsystem", it's a simple string "(block, tty, pci, ...)" that 
seems to indicate a category of devices rather than a specific device...
And that is the end of the document.
Now, where in it did it explain how to determine whether a device is a block 
device or a char device when attempting to use the major and minor numbers 
extracted from sysfs to do a mknod?

And they'll find out, as I did, that it scales horribly.  (Scanning /dev with 
a shell script took about 15 seconds last time I tried it, which was 2 
laptops ago...)
I can document scalability issues, though.  (That and sequencing are why the 
netlink method exists in the first place...)
I was writing up a "history of hotplug" document that got trashed when my 
laptop died last month, but when I get around to rewriting it I plan to 
mention how /sys/hotplug was originally a big shell script and why they 
stopped doing that:

They get major and minor numbers for SUBSYSTEM==pci?
Is there something wrong other than the need to filter out /sys/class/block if 
that starts contaminating the pool of char devices (which it isn't in current 
kernels)?

Could be.  Or I could have been looking at an old kernel.

Ok, how do I find a list of:
A) all char devices in the system.
B) all block devices currently in the system
C) whether a device that just got hotplugged (and I just got a hotplug event 
for) is a char or block device so I can call mknod?  (I know how to tell when 
there's no device node for it, there's no "dev" entry or no MAJOR=/MINOR= 
variables.  But when I do have those, how do I tell if they refer to a block 
or a char device?
Are you saying there's no reliable way to do that, or are you saying the 
document explains how to do that?

What does going on about buggy apps have to do with listing what you're 
allowed to do?  Listing things not to do isn't the same as listing what 
you're allowed to do, unless attempting to arrive at an API document by 
process of elimination.

I've noticed.  I suspect I phrased my goals unclearly.

I'm trying to document hotplug, which includes scanning to initially 
populate /dev, and firmware loading.  Documenting a portion of sysfs is a 
side effect of documenting hotplug.
