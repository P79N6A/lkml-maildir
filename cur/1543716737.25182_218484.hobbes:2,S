 From what I could google from previous discussions, this bug affects ARM 
architectures but not x86. Am I correct in assuming this?
Please note that I'm not implying that since it doesn't affect x86, then it's 
ok. I've already tried linux on an iPaq 3970 and it runs great! I really feel 
that one of the Linux's strenghts is that it can run almost anywhere :)
It is just that I'm responsible for a project where we use a compact flash as 
storing device on an x86 system, and I would sleep better if this bug doesn't 
affect our system directly.
