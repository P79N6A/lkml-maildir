The overhead is easy to avoid by making use of dup2() and close() to keep 
the lowest file descriptors in the table free, allowing open() and socket() 
to always return 3 or 4.
Alternatively, the kernel could track available file descriptors using a 
tree to efficiently insert freed slots into an ordered list of free 
regions (something similar to the avl tree used in vmas).  Is it worth 
doing?
