Have you ever tried installing windows xp from scratch on a new laptop?
Same (if not worse) problem.

If you buy hardware that only works with one particular release of one
distribution, that is pretty much a way to ensure you will soon be
unable to use that hardware anymore.  Don't do that.

People that install a distribution and use it.  Sometimes they upgrade
to the next release of the distribution.

Well if you change the kernel on your distribution, then you aren't
running that distribution anymore.  You changed something.

Well it is their problem to fix, and your problem that you bought their
stuff in the first place.

The kernel developers can't fix the problems of the closed source code
anyhow, so it isn't the kernel developers problem.  It is a problem of
the closed source developer and their users (who chose that hardware
themselves.)  The kernel developers didn't recomend the hardware, and
didn't make the users buy that stuff.
