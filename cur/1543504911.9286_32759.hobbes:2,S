   As the reality continues supplying us with buggy PCI devices with
almost all conceivable faults, I'm going to extend the fixup mechanisms
in our PCI code and re-arrange the device probing. There will exist
two fixup tables: a generic one and an arch-specific one (the latter
will contain fixups for arch-specific bridges etc.) and each fixup
entry will consist of entry type (telling when should be the fixup
activated), vendor+device ID and a function pointer. The generic code
will automatically call these fixups during bus scan.
New bus scan algorithm:
	for each bus {
		for each device on that bus {
			read configuration header
			READ FIXUP  [table lookup; fix broken headers]
		}
		BUS FIXUP  [function call; fix ghost buses et cetera]
		scan child buses
	}
	GLOBAL FIXUP  [function call; assigns addresses and so on]
	claim resources for all cards
	FINAL FIXUP  [again a function call; fixes forgotten I/O enables etc.]
	QUIRKS  [table lookup; fixes the remaining problems]
Host bridge scanning will be no longer initiated by the generic code -- there
will be an arch-dependent function which will call pci_scan_bus for all host
bridges it knows, passing struct pci_ops containing pointers to configuration
space access function for that bridge, so that the architectures won't have
to do their own multiplexing inside low-level access functions.
I'd like to know your opinion on this approach.
				Have a nice fortnight
