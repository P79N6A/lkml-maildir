I don't really like this patchet at all.  At some point it's a lot nicer
to have a lot of paramaters that are related and passed down a long
callchain into a structure, and I think the aio code is over that threshold.
The completion function cleanups look okay to me, but I'd rather add
that completion function to struct kiocb instead of removing kiocb use.
I have this slight feeling you want to use this completions for something
else than the current aio code, if that's the case it would help
if you could explain briefly in what direction your heading.
