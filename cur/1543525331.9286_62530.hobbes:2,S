Yep, we agree on this.  When I investigated extracting some of the
worst offenders from CAP_SYS_ADMIN, I had to create[0] another three
caps before I could even start to get my head around the CSA mess.
Andrew Morgan has usefully suggested that some operations should
require combinations of privs, which lets us avoid having far too
many, but most of those we have at the moment are way too general
purpose for us to use that idea usefully.
Realistically, I think 40 or 48 bits should be enough, but I wouldn't
like it to be my fault when the disk structures have to change again,
so 64 gets my vote anyway :-)
Matthew.
[0] Conceptually, you understand.  It never quite got as far as
    becoming a patch.
