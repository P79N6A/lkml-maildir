The HyperTransport is directly attached, but it still uses parts of
the MSI infrastructure.   Mostly we've direct-coded it, but at some
point the MSI code should be expanded to support HTX devices as well.

I've used our PCIe card on the serverworks HT2000/ST2000 chipset with MSI, and it seems
to work fine (once you enable MSI in the config space, which the current
BIOS doesn't seem to do for some reason).  It may be that it doesn't work
well with PCI, but does with PCIe (different parts of the chipset, after all,
so it seems possible).

Sure, that's true of almost everything new.   It remains broken until people
start using it, complain, and get the bugs fixed.   Some of us have a vested
interest in having MSI work, since it's the only way we can deliver interrupts.
We've already worked with a few BIOS writers to get problems fixed, and we'll
keep doing so as we find problems.   If enough hardware vendors and consumers
do so, the broken stuff will get fixed, and stay fixed, because it will get
tested.
