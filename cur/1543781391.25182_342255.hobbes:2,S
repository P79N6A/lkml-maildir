Ooh, thanks!

Yeah, I was thinking about that too, but I can't think of a reasonable
return code to use.  -1 for "don't probe"?  Or <0 for "fatal error,
don't touch this bus any more"?  Anyway, client drivers will probably
only use one of the two detection methods because if they need to
implement attach_adapter they can just call i2c_probe from there.

Sure, I can do that.

I didn't think anybody was porting client drivers any more, but if
you're still updating that doc, I can too.  :-)  -Nathan
