MUNE,
I added this because I found that in some laptops the dsdt reported a
bus present that wasn't actually, so the bus would be added at boot
time, but the PRT not read if the laptop was booted undocked.  Initially
I tried to get a handle to the existing bus, and then if the bus already
was added, just call acpi_bus_start() - but this did not cause the PRT
to be read in this case - the only thing that worked for me was to
remove the bus and readd it.  If there's a better way to handle this,
I'd appreciate the suggestion.  
Kristen
