Hi Dietmar,
  G100 works with matroxfb since 2.2.0 (drivers after Jan 11, 1999), multihead
since Jan 21.
  fbtv 2.32 works fine in cfb8, 16, 24 and 32 with matroxfb/G100 (&G200, on
Intel, I did not ever try plug Bt848 into Motorola PPC (PReP)).

Could you try to boot with
  video=scrollback:0
to check, whether 2.1.124 (faster) behavior will reappear on 2.2.3+? I think
it could.

I'm using fbtv on matroxfb G100 (832x640x32bpp) without problems with fbtv
somewhere around 2.32 (binary does not want to reveal version; 2.37 from
debian-potato does not work, probably because it says `channel XX
(PAL/ntsc-cable-jp)' instead of PAL/pal-europe... (using same kernel
driver 0.6.3)). Console switch time is almost zero.
  But I think that lock of console switching is caused by bug in fbtv (there
is another bug - sometime when switching from fbtv screen to another console,
fbtv does not correctly stop Bt848, so that part of picture is written into
new console).

PII350/128MB SDRAM, Bt848-AVerMedia TVPhone, OPTi82C930 sound, AIC7895 SCSI,
8GB SCSI Fujitsu, CDROM. There were problems - machine died hard (no-numlock,
no messages) in few hours (2-20) when grabbing teletext data; after upgrade
to aic7xxx-5.1.13 it grabs data for some days (~50 hrs) without problems,
so I hope that it is fixed now... (problem was not caused by locked bus,
other transfers (playing music) still repeated last ~0.5sec (?64KB) of sound
when crash occured)). Kernel is 2.2.5 - vger990329.
                                                Best regards,
                                                        Petr Vandrovec

P.S.: Machine grabs teletext 24hrs/day (unless I'm watching TV), see

 if you are interested (czech
teletexts only).
