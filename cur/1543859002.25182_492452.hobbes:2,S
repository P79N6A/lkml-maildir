You are probably not looking at the right places.

Then you should discuss this with law makers, politicians and the
various pressure groups about copyright and/or authors rights and you
surely *must* deal beforehand with the patent plague since this is even
more restricting in any sense than author rights ever was (let alone
copyright).
And for such  political debate LKML is probably not a good place.

They are not blocked - it is up to the users to decide and live with the
consequences.
