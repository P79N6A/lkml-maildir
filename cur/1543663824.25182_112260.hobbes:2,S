Hi,
I have created a patch for 2.4.20 for the tg3 driver from Jeff
Garziks and David Millers tg3 1.4c driver which I'm hoping will be
in the next kernel.
The patch is at 
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/2.4.20/
Note that because of NAPI the 2.4.20 driver will not work with 2.4.19...
I have been using this driver now for 6 days without a lockup (4 days with
2.4.20 and 2 days before that with 2.4.21-pre4) and it has
been working great.  With the stock 2.4.20 tg3 driver we wouldn't get past
36 hours without a lockup...
Regards
James Bourne
