You can't really have one without the other, and if you're going to add
that sort of functionality, it's not strictly tied to the GPIOs.

As soon as a driver comes along and says that it wants, say, GPIO 42,
which happens to be an alternate pin function for pin #128, you've
effectively coupled the two, especially since the underlying refcounting
is more applicable to the pin function than the GPIO itself.
And this is something where you will have to remux, or at least force
that GPIOs availability through the board setup code, but there's little
point in dealing with mux issues in the board setup code at all if this
is done dynamically based off of the driver requirements and subsequent
refcounting.
Static muxing is something that no longer makes any sense. Devices are
piling more and more desired functions under mux, and that's not going
away.
