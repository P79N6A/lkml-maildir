Yes, this creates the interesting situation of two responses (one from 
the local client code, and one from the server) potentially coming as a 
client changes a file which he has a watch on.

Yes - add watch could be exported, I don't see a way around this since a 
filesystem has to be able to tell the server what to watch.  It does not 
really matter if that were done in kernel or not, but I would prefer it 
to be done in kernel since that would avoid having to ioctl down to the 
kernel
