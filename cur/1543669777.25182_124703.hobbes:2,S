I tried this sometime ago (2.2.x timeframe) for canning mozilla into an
small amount of memory and it was kind of doable - not too complicated,
in fact - the only thing is it would reduce the machine to a crawl some
times (I guess I did not know how to throttle the swap) - I even got it
working with bzip2 -9 [this was a pure exercise].
