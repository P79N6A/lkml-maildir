If the root file system is ext2, it does become a security issue since
currently active logs will continue to record log entries until the
filesystem is absolutly filled. I should say, if the log device fills up,
since the log directory is usually /var/log, or /var/adm. Some logs show
up in etc, but that really depends on the configuration. It IS usefull if the
filesystem is "full" due to attacks - daemons tend to terminate themselves,
and their log entry indicates what the problem was. If it is an attack, then
it's a security issue.
The only reason it helps fragmentation (subject to actual implementor
statements) is that the filesystem code will use every scavanged block
possible under saturation. When the filesystem gets cleand up later,
these excessively fragmented files will remain, and continue to cause
access delays.
Naturally, deleting (or backup/restore) the file(s) cleans up the fragmentation.

True, but this is a side effect caused by stopping user allocations.

It shouldn't have to. This is a tuneable value, and can be set to 0.
(tune2fs).
The "super user" is also an option. It defaults to the user "root", but
can be specified to be a user OR a group by tune2fs (-g option for group,
-u option for user).
