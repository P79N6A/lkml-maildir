I can put on the table:
486SLC, 12MB RAM
i386, 8MB RAM (hey, this box is nearly build up by discrete parts:)
Am386, 8MB RAM
P-Classic, 32MB RAM (even that much RAM can go short after an uptme of
about a month...)
Unfortunately, you need an additional kernel patch because nearly all
distros are using mach==i486 which gives you nice sigills on an i386
otherwise...
