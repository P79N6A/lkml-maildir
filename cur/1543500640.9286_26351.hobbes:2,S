Hmm... It's interesting. At some moment I tried to find a decent description
of kernel internals. Most of OS/2 folks I knew were FightoNet sysops
and some of them were distinctly non-luserish. I could answer their
questions re UNIX-related FM to R. They couldn't. And it wasn't a matter
of inability to find books in .su - Lions and (4.3) Daemon Book went in
many copies. *That* kind of samizdat was absolutely standard way to get
documentation. Hell knows... If you are aware of any decent description of
OS/2 kernel - share, OK?

s/Open/available in/. v6 was not too open, after all. And I'm not sure
that AT&T had worked their balls out marketing it.
ObUnrelated: yet another week from hell. Sigh... Ever did over-the-phone
handholding for luser who blew the CVS up? Yeah, he had backups. Lots of
them. Unfortunately he had fscked the thing up *long* ago. Yup, tried to
live with two vendor branches. With usual results. And indeed he claimed
that he never did anything like that...
