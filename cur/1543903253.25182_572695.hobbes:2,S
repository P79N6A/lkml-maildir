Subject: [PATCH] Fix several memory leaks in cr_backlight_probe()

Hi,
After fixing the too small memory allocation in cr_backlight_probe()
from drivers/video/backlight/cr_bllcd.c 
(commit e3bbb3f05339de438faf54124f25c92e6fe4ac2e) I noticed that the 
Coverity checker also thought there were a few memory leaks in there. 
I took a closer look and confirmed that there were indeed several 
leaks.
At the start of the function we allocate storage for a 
'struct cr_panel' and store the pointer in a variable named 'crp'. 
Then we call pci_get_device() and pci_read_config_byte() and if 
either of them fail we return without freeing the memory allocated 
for the 'struct cr_panel'. These two leaks are easy to fix since we 
don't even use 'crp' for anything up to this point, so I simply 
moved the allocation further down in the function so it only happens 
just before we actually need it.
A bit further down we call backlight_device_register() and store the 
result in 'crp->cr_backlight_device'. In case of error we return 
'crp->cr_backlight_device' from the function, thus leaking 'crp' 
itself. The same thing happens with the call to lcd_device_register().
To fix these two leaks I declare two new pointers to hold the return 
values, so that in case of error we can return the pointer (as before) 
but without leaking 'crp'.
Please consider merging.
Note: Due to lack of hardware the patch has only been compile tested.
