Because we don't use the in-kernel firmware loader at the moment.
The driver comes from a time were 2.4 didn't have the firmware loader 
and drivers cloned the firmware loading stuff from one of the soundcard 
drivers.
Currently there is no way to solve this problem, because we don't have 
any kernel structure that we could attach to and have it export the 
sysfs and firmware loading magic.
We plan to use the kernel i2c subsystem again, then all our problems 
hopefully vanish.
CU
Michael.
