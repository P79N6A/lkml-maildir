Very well said. And I might add that some input from people with small
desktop machines might be useful to the developers, since I doubt they
are running small slow machines. While I wouldn't compromise big memory
performance (much) for small, one beauty of Linux is that it will run
well on small machines.
Of course it may be that some other VM will prove to be bnetter than
either, but hopefully not until 2.5. I'd still like to see VM in a
module and then everyone could play with their pet theory;-)
