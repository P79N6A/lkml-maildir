Subject: [PATCH] rfc: threaded epoll_wait thundering herd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
If multiple threads are parked on epoll_wait (on a single epoll fd) and
events become available, epoll performs a wake up of all threads of the
poll wait list, causing a thundering herd of processes trying to grab
the eventpoll lock.
This patch addresses this by using exclusive waiters (wake one). Once
the exclusive thread finishes transferring it's events, a new thread
is woken if there are more events available.
Makes sense?
