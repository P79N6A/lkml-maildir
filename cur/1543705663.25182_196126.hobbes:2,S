The kernel internals are not nor Posix, nor SysV nor anything. It is just
by chance (or logic ;)) that some functions in kernel are named like the
userspace similars. Kernel source is in its own namespace.
One example (not a syscall, but useful I expect):
- Kernel has a 'sys_clone()' function, numbered __NR_clone
- GLibc implements a linux-specific system-call 'clone()', using sys_clone
- Glibc uses 'clone()' to implement 'fork()'
So, don't try to look for fork() inside the kernel.
