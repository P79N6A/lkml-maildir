My preference is to use "return;" statements in functions returning
void, even if functions is very small. It's just sugar for my eyes,
to really see exit points. . Without returns I've feeling that
something is missing there. Yes, my oddity.
Plus, so far CodingStyle does not say anything about non obligatory
return statements.
These should be "fixed" too, though:
~/linux-2.6$ grep -h "return;" -A1 -r drivers/ arch/ | grep "^}$" | \
wc -l
1354
Obviously, drivers/ata is almost pure (3). ;-)
Either way, I prefer to leave alone these "return;"s, until CodingStyle
permits them.

I'll send patch shortly.

I guess common practice is not to put space here.

And here.
I'll correct this, and will apply to battery2-2.6.git.
Thanks!
