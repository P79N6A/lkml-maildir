I see much improved performance so far. Been running for about 3 hours 
and the highest latency I've seen thus far is ~260 usec and that was 
mmap not swap. The highest latency I've seen from swapping is ~198 and 
we have been in and out of swap at least several times. The latency 
trace can be seen here:
