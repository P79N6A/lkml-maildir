No, the boot specification allows direct access to the CD.  See the El 
Torito specification, specifically the parts that talk about "no 
emulation" mode.

That's just the way *some* people are using it.  Look at PXELINUX for

PXE specification to download arbitrary files, specified at runtime, via 
TFTP.
