Thanks for your reply, Andi.

Our hardware engineer has combed the Intel and ASUS websites, but found
nothing.  I'll give the APIC a try and see if I get different results and
let you know.

HZ on the INTEL platform is 100, so this should simply add 50 to the current
value of jiffies.  Besides, assigning the value to the unsigned int field
(expires) will truncate it to an integer anyway.  Is there a more
appropriate way to handle a short timeout?
Thanks,
