Btw, I would prefer this one to be applied instead. The other parts should 
be okay, right?
[PATCH] CodingStyle remove sizeof preferred form
It isn't clear that the use of p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), ...) is
preferred over p = kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...) - in fact,
there are some good reasons to use the latter form.
Therefore, the choice of which to use should be left up to the
developer concerned, and not written in to the coding style.
For discussion, please see the thread:

-The preferred form for passing a size of a struct is the following:
-
-	p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), ...);
-
-The alternative form where struct name is spelled out hurts readability and
-introduces an opportunity for a bug when the pointer variable type is changed
-but the corresponding sizeof that is passed to a memory allocator is not.

 Casting the return value which is a void pointer is redundant. The conversion
 from void pointer to any other pointer type is guaranteed by the C programming
 language.
