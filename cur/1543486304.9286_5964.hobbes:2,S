Sure.

Not really.
The future:
 * you need another security check that checks that the link count on the
   directory is 1.
If you don't have a ".." entry, the link count for directories is always
1, except if you have hard links - exactly the way it works for normal
files.
Note that there are many unix tools that know about the directory link
counts, but they also know about ignoring it too - because there are
already many filesystems that do not have the standard unix link count
behaviour.
