hmm, this is on a   
  - Tyan Tiger MPX S2466N-4M
  - AMD Dual 1.8GHZ Athlon
00:00.0 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 700c (rev 11)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 700d
00:07.0 ISA bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 7440 (rev 05)
isn't nForce2 from nVIDIA ?
