Well, that is part of the accounting overhead the increases with context switch 
rate.  You also need to include the time it takes to figure out which of the 
time limits is closes (run time limit, profile time, slice time, etc).  Then, 
you also need to remove the timer when switching away.  No, it is not a lot, but 
it is way more than the nothing we do when we can turn it all over to the 
periodic tick.  The choice is load sensitive overhead vs flat overhead.
