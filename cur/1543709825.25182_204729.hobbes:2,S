Hi Steve, I should note that pramfs was not designed with *really large* 
nvram
storage in mind. It was more designed to use space efficiently on small 
amounts
of nvram. For instance, pramfs inodes only have a 2-d block pointer table
(vs ext2/ext3's 3-d i_block[14] pointer table), so the max file size is 
(b/4)^2
blocks or b^3/16 bytes, b being the blocksize. Also, offsets within the 
fs are unsigned
long's, so there's a 4 gig limit already on 32-bit machines.
So in short, for 10s or even 100s of MB, pramfs is fine, but for GB or more
storage it's not an appropriate fs.
Steve
