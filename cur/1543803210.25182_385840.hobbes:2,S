Nope it doesn't work :-(
I ran this test:
 
http://www.kihontech.com/tests/rt/monotonic.c
And got this:
$ ./monotonic
main program pid=8477
hello from thread 0!
hello from thread 1!
hello from thread 2!
hello from thread 3!
hello from thread 4!
Failed! prev: 6279.925610302   current: 6279.874615349
$ cat /proc/cmdline
root=/dev/md0 ro console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0 nmi_watchdog=2 lapic earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 clock=pmtmr
$ uname -r
2.6.15-rt4-sr2
(I also added Ingo, Thomas, and John in the CC)
I'll reboot to vanilla 2.6.15 and see if that is broken too (just to
make sure)
