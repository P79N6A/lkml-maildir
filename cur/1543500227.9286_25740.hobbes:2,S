Same here. But  on 2.0.36,  adaptec scsi uw  and 3c905b. The
box  is  still responsible  to  everything  else serving  X,
samba  etc. Only NFS  hangs!!!  As  long as  /var/spool/mail
was  mounted from  another identical  linux box  i even  had
difficulties to log in (for obvious reasons).
This  only  happens  on   heavy  network-load  and  vanishes
after  some hours.   I suspect  that the  vortex-driver from
Donald  Becker still  has  problems to  serve 100baseTx  and
full-duplex. I tried  3c59x.c v0.99H  and v0.99L  which both
didnt cure the problem.
So  Wolfgang, what  networking-cards are  you using  on both
ends?  3com? Let us  talk to Donald Becker  and collect more
info.
	Regards,
	Micha.
