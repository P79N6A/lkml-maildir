Hi all
I apologize if this is OT, but I've tried looking around, and still can't find 
an answer, so here it goes.
I'm trying to set up a computer with the following configuration:
16 IBM 120GB IDE drives:
	On-board VIA controller with 4 drives
	Two promise ATA100 controllers with 4 drives each
	One CMD649U controller with 4 drives
Problem seems to be that the motherboard has addressed them on the PCI bus as 
follows:
Promise (1) 0.0c.00 (ide[01])
Promise (2) 0.0d.00 (ide[23])
CMD649U 0.0f.00 (ide[45])
VIA 0.10.1 (ide[67])
This gives me the VIA controller, which that motherboard wants to boot from, 
as the last controllers, which messes up all installers I've tried (though 
that's only Redhat and SuSE).
How can I force PCI 0.10.1 to be ide[01]?
Thanks all
Please cc: to me as I'm not on the list
