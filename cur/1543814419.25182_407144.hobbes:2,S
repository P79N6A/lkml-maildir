I did not experience any sata_nv problems with 2 disks/RAID1 (at least I
never noticed). I immediately got the "warning: many lost ticks. Your
time source seems to be instable or some driver is hogging interupts"
message when I started using 4 disks/RAID5. It's possible that most
people do not have enough disks connected to the nForce4 to trigger the
bug.
