	Under 2.6.20-rc1 and 2.6.20-rc2, I get the following complaint
for several network programs running on my system:
[  156.381868] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at net/core/sock.c:1523

	I have 35 of these messages is my console log at the moment.
The only difference that I've noticed between the messages is
that they are for variety of processes: most for tor, xntpd, sendmail,
procmail.  The processes get to this point by sys_write, sys_send, or
sys_sendto (procmail was doing a sys_sendto, so it was also doing something
related to networking, even though it is not a program one normally
would think of as doing any networking system calls).
	My system seems to work OK even with these warning messages.
I can debug it futher.  I just figure I should report it now, because
I may have done everyone a disservice by putting off reporting it in
rc1 in the hopes of finding time to debug it.
