If you mount you ext2 filesytem with synchronous i/o rather than async
they'll be signficantly less brittle at the expense of some speed. I do
this occasionaly when testing new hardware or radical changes
something like:
mount -o remount sync /fsname

both actually if your're refering to reiserfs/ext3/jfs
