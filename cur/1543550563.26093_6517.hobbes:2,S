Indeed.
For another fine example of GPL technology covered by a parent, check out:
http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?pn=US06049528__
This a patent filed by Sun in June 1997 and awarded in April 2000 which 
covers very well the ethernet bonding device in Linux 2.2.x.
I wonder if the equalizer device present in Linux kernels since before 
1996 could count as prior art. IANAL, of course.
