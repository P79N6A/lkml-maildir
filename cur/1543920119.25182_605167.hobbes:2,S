Hi,
A few days ago I sent the enclosed bug report to the address
advertised in Documentation/rocket.txt.  Till now I got no reply.
While they think about it, I decided to air the problem here, too.
In a nutshell, the rocket module doesn't deregister its devices during
removal, they stay in /sys/class/tty causing grief on reinsert and
crippling udev.
Assuming it's an easy fix, can I plea for a patch against 2.6.23?  Or
is there a workaround like manually deregistering the devices?
Thanks,
Feri.

Hi,
I hope I send this message to the right address...
I experience the following with the 2.09 version of the driver, as
included in vanilla Linux 2.6.23.  If I insert the module, I got some
pretty normal messages, like:
RocketPort device driver module, version 2.09, 12-June-2003

Installing RocketPort UPCI 8 port w/external I/F, creating /dev/ttyR8 - 15
However, if I remove the module from the kernel, and then insert it
again, lots of error messages result:
RocketPort device driver module, version 2.09, 12-June-2003

 =======================
And so on for each device.
However, the card seems to operate all right.  Still, the messages
suggest something isn't quite right and could use some fixing.  Hope
you can find the problem.
