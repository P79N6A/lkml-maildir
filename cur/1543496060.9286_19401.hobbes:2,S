No, I doubt that Linus would ever accept something non-essential
into the kernel that can be correctly done from userland
utilities.  The fact that no userland utility may exist to do
such a thing is not grounds for putting something in the kernel.
It has been my experience in reading postings and threads on l-k
that this is the way Linus works, and it is a good thing IMHO.

Perhaps.  There are other projects on the go right now to make a
GNOME and KDE frontend to compilation.  You might want to
investigate that.
