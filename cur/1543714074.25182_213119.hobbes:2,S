I'm finished mostly, all major difference between the DRM CVS and 2.6 are
in the bk tree 
http://freedesktop.org:1234/drm-2.6,
 I'll move it onto
bkbits when it arrives back on the scene, Andrew you should be able to
submit Arjans patch to Linus with this bunch and I'll do a follow up later
to make it use whatever we decide with respect to the __user, a simple
#ifndef/define might be enough...
I'm going to bed and tomorrow am taking a well deserved drinking session
:-)
Dave.
