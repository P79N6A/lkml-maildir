Yes, I can definitely verify this, its not only related to kde/kmail, all 
other application are affected as well. Btw, I already upgraded to 
2.6.0-test2. 
Also, the slowdown seems to be related to hd-accessing/caching. My root-fs hd 
makes rather loud noises on accessing it -- with 2.6.0-testX the frequency of 
disk-accessing and so also the noise-level has dramatically increased 
compared to 2.4.x
So following the advices, I will try bk4 and mm4 and also will do the

stuff.
