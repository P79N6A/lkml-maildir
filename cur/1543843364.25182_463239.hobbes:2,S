Not for kernel modules : unload/load is enough.

Not true with the dynamic facility loading. LTTng can register new events upon
module load/unload.

Maybe, but it can be useful to have static instrumentation available for those
limited conditional tracepoints.

If the trace points are modified with the code by the ones who make the
original code changes, it lessens the maintainance overhead. Furthermore, if
there is a major change in a code path that requires rethinking the trace
points, the person introducing the change has the best knowledge of what to do
with the trace point. I think that trace point maintainance should be left to
subsystem maintainers, not a centralised task done by distributions once in a
while.
Talking about experience, Karim has maintained the original LTT trace points,
which targeted key kernel event, for years without major trace points changes
between kernel versions. I think he already proved that maintainance of static
trace points in not an issue.
However, I restate that my position is that both static and dynamic
instrumentation of the kernel are a necessity and that a tracer core should be
usable by both.
