Hi,
I got a minor problem with booting the kernel.
I've got a Network Computer that boots using NOVELL RPL over 802.3.
With mars I am able to feed this computer any disk I want, although it is
up to the programs to be able to work. (Normal freedos disk images work)
I've found that booting freedos is no problem, but running loadlin is,
running lilo does not work either.
So I thought about feeding the NC just a plain Linux Kernel. Tadah! It is
accepted! (loadlin and lilo don't come that far for loading the kernel.)
The kernel is really able to download itself. But then the stage of
uncompressing:
invalid compressed format (err=2).
This message is issued in lib/inflate.c. after examening the kernel image
header, using the get_byte function call.
I guess this is an issue of the starting address of the kernel, since it
is loaded by RPL, which itself occupies some space.
So my question is, is this a logic conclussion, and most important: has
anybody seen this behaviour already, knows what is going on, and
(hopefully) has a fix, or at least a suggestion?
If not, I will find it out myself, but I'd rather do not something that
someone else has already done.
Thanx!
