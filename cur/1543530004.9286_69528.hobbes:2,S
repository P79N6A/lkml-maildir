No, the asm output looks fine:
egcs loads local_bh_count into a register for the in_interrupt() test,
then it increases the register and stores the register back into
local_bh_count.
I have 2 explanations for the high do_softirq numbers:
* problem with readprofile (version 2.00, May 1996): it also reported
that sys_shutdown() got called, and I doubt that this is true ;)
[prof_shift=1]
* do_softirq reenables the interrupts after a hardware interrupt. If a
timer interrupt was pending, then do_softirq gets the profiling hit.
