Actually, we can fix it with file->f_light thing Tigran is doing:

Not so different. I am blocking fork until I can revoke all open file
descriptors (i.e. substitute with NULL) whereas Tigran is dropping
tasklist_lock and retrying. I am not doing get_bad_file() because I
don't think we really need it. Tigran's mmap takedown code looks pretty
much what I want too.

I searched fsdevel archives but couldn't find anything on that. Al?
