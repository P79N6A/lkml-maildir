I have no permission from the customer who actually payed the survey to
publish the results yet. But I continue asking for it.

I have a slightly outdated patch with that around on top of RT, but it
introduces yet another level of ugliness. 
You must carefully identify the places where you really need the
hard_local_irq_dis/enable(). It's not hard though. 
I used it in the early days of PREEMPT_RT to identify the IRQ off
sections and some other deadlocking scenarios. I kept this always as an
option for adding on top of Ingos implementation to close the gap to
"ruby".
