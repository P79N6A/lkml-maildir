Think about a 64-bit integer on ppc32.  It will by necessity kept in two 
registers.  On gcc I believe it will always be a consecutive pair of 
registers (AFAIK that's a hard-coded assumption in gcc, with the result 
that gcc has a nonstandard internal register numbering for x86 since the 
commonly used dx:ax pair is actually registers 2:0 in the hardware 
numbering.)

Right, of course.

Pretty much.  Then you can do conventional copy propagation and 
elimination after expanding subregisters to get rid of the extra ops in 
the common case.
