First: Top posting is something that disqualifies you. Please don't 
top post otherwise people will belive that you are just a troll.

I don't take this personal, but the main problem seems to be that most
of the people in this discussion have far less kernel experience than I have.
I did actively write code from many different places in different OS 
implementaions. Ans more important, I did read a lot of other people's code.
If Linux people have kernel experience at all, they usually only know
a specific part of one single OS: Linux.
Writing good kernel code is more! It educates a lot to read read read
a lot in other OS sources to understand other ideas and to become
able to judge about the quality os a specific implementation.
You seem to have no experience than IDE in Linux. It would help if you 
first look at other implementations in order to become able to judge yourself.

Again: this is completely unrelated to the problem. Why do you introduce
it?

I am not whining, but you answer with  unrelated stuff. Why? Are you missing
experience and arguments?
