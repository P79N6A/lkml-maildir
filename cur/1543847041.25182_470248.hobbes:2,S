Even as the first thing in agp_amdk7_probe() ?
What is pci_register_driver returning ?

When we modprobe the chipset driver, and run through the ->probe, it's all pci layer
stuff really, up until we agp_alloc_bridge(). But if you're not getting that far,
the core agpgart stuff doesn't even come into play.

This is the behaviour I'd expect if agp-amdk7.ko hadn't been loaded, but agpgart.ko had.
It's something of a mystery to me as that driver hasn't changed in ages asides
from spelling fixes and other trivialities.

Damn, that's going back a bit..
But again, this driver hasn't really changed much since 2.5.x, so I'm 
wondering if this is a side-effect of some change in another subsystem.
Can you narrow it down to a specific kernel version where it broke ?
2.6.15 -> 2.6.18 is such a huge delta it's not even worth looking at.
Narrow the scope, and I'll eyeball the pci changes etc.

I don't have any AMD hardware to test any more, so I've no chance of
trying to reproduce this.  All I can suggest is to try and narrow
down where it's failing, and then maybe I'll have enough clues to hazard
a guess at the cause.

That code runs later when /dev/agpgart is open()'d, so it shouldn't
affect this. It shouldn't be hard to revert though if you want to
try it.  Also, that only changed the AGPx8 path, which no K7 chipsets can do.
If you ended up running that code, something is deeply screwed.
