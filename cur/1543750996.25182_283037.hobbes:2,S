Some will start testing right away, others will wait 2 or 3 days
first.  And that's fine.  Not all 2.6.x kernels will be good; but if
we do releases every 1 or 2 weeks, some of them *will* be good.  The
problem with the -rc releases is that we try to predict in advance
which releases in advance will be stable, and we don't seem to be able
to do a good job of that.  If we do a release every week, my guess is
that at least 1 in 3 releases will turn out to be stable enough for
most purposes.  But we won't know until after 2 or 3 days which
releases will be the good ones.
In practice, that's all the -rc releases are these days anyway (there
are times when a 2.6.x-rcy release is more stable than 2.6.z).  The
problem is that since the -rc releases are called what they are
called, they don't get enough testing.
