hi there.
I just got myself a abit BP6, with 2x 466 MHz celeron and 256 MB memory. 
What happens is that if I ctrl-alt-del the machine, the system crashes
completely. The harddrive led stays on and nothing is possible anymore.
(keyboard dead as well, including the special sysrq stuff)
how should I proceed to find what is causing this problem ?
