This is how I figured it, too. I'm not sure if the patch does work (didn't
read yet), but the above scenario looks exactly the same I thought ...
If the patches look ok, I'll try them the next thing tomorrow morning
(can't try pinging the other host is in my little brother's room and he's
sleeping with computer turned off ;)
BTW, I think Linus meant that your patch won't work if an interrupt
handler calls disable_irq(its_own_irq). But as I said I didn't read it
yet ...
