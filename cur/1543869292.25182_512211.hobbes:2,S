The idea is not bad. I won't guarantee mine will be as good or better,
but I think it is sensible to try implementing the simplest approach
first, so we can get a baseline to justify more complexity against...
Your code just needs work, but if it really produces good results then
it should be able to be made into a mergeable patch.

Yep.

OK that would be good. I'll see if I can code something up by next week.
Thanks,
