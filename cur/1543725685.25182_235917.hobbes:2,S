ketchup is a script that automatically patches between kernel
versions, downloading and caching patches as needed, and automatically
determining the latest versions of several trees. Available at:

New in this version by popular demand:
- falls back to .gz files if .bz2 files aren't available
- can find BK snapshots in old/ directories
  (aka the jgarzik memorial hack)
- option to rename directories to linux-<v> after update
- can read default options from KETCHUP_OPTS
