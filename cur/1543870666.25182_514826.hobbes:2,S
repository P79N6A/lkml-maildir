I am wondering if it is useful to add another mode to advise block 
allocation policy? Something like indicating which physical block/block 
group to allocate from (goal), and whether ask for strict contigous 
blocks. This will help preallocation or reservation to choose the right 
blocks for the file.
Right now neither ext4 preallocation implementation or reservation are 
guranteed to allocate/reserve contigugous extents. If the application 
told it so, it could do more searching to satisfy the requirement.
Or fadvise is the right interface?
