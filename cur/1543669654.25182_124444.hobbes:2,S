It gets even worse, because performance of hotswap events on disk adds 
is critical and spawning processes is incredibly slow compared to the 
performance required by some telecom applications...
A much better solution could be had by select()ing on a filehandle 
indicating when a new hotswap event is ready to be processed.  No races, 
no security issues, no performance issues.
