The arch implementations of pci_map_*() et al. might start
failing since they were written assuming that DAC never got
enabled.

I only do sparc32 build testing, which you can do on a sparc64
box and Al Viro has great recipies for cross tool building and
usage.

How exactly does your device struct extension work?  I ask because
struct device is embedded into other structs, such as pci_dev,
so it has to be fixed in size unless you have some clever trick. :)
