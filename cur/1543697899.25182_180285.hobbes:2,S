Hi,
I did compile a 2.6.0-test10 before and I patched the sources to
2.6.0-test11, then I did the commande line and got the following output:
[root@rade7 linux-2.6.0-test11]$ make clean && make -j 16 && make
modules_install && make install

I got this problem, but just once. I was working when I did the command
line once again (might be some ghosts).
