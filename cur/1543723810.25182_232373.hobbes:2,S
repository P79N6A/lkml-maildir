Wow.  That module moved from arch/i386/kernel/ to drivers/firmware
a few months ago.  It would have broken with BK this week as
those symbols were removed and merged into a single 'edd' exported
object.
I recommend doing a 'bk -r co -q', make clean, make oldconfig, to
clean up your copy of the tree.
Thanks,
Matt
