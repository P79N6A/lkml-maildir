Thanks, but this has nothing specific to extracting CD audio, and is 
unrelated to the panic message you originally sent. I.e.: we have two 
reports from you, one tainted about CD grabbing, and one untainted about 
some generic IRQ-related issue. Could you please try producing an untainted 
oops with the word scsi in one of the lines?
Maybe you are just causing the drive to try hard reading data that don't 
exist, and thus deliver the IRQ at unusual time? Is this reproducible on 
non-SMP kernels?
