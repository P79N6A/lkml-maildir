Guys, this is _way_ ugly. We definitely dont need more crap in ->flags
for private driver use, stuff them somewhere else in the rq. rq->cmd[0]
usage would be a whole lot better. This patch should never have been
merged. If each and every driver needs 5 private bits in ->flags,
well...
Was this even posted on linux-kernel for review?
