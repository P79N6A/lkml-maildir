Ugh, /etc/mtab really ought to die.
Anyway, with traditional /etc/mtab, mount --move produces:
   none on /tmp/a type ramfs (rw)
   /tmp/a on /tmp/b type none (rw)
ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab and retry, it works fine:
   none on /tmp/b type ramfs (rw)
I'll have a look at mount later today, if nobody else gets there first.
