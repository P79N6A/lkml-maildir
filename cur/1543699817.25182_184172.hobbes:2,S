Hi!
> I did not found this feature in standard.
I did :-)  C99, section 6.7.8 "Initialization", constraint 10:
"... If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized
explicitly, then:
   - if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer;
   - if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero;
..."

Yes, such warning exists, but only for automatic variables.
				Have a nice fortnight
