I'll check this asap

Hmm, early_ioremap_debug exists only in ioremap_32.c
Have to adapt  the 64-bit version first.
But wait the 64-bit code contains already debug output for this.  See
the boot-logs that I have attached to my previous mails.
(Interestingly the code for 64-bit early_io(re/un)map resides not in
ioremap_64.c but in init_64.c.)
