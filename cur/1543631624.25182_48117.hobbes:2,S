Subject: how to get per-socket stats on udp rx buffer overflow?

I posted this on netdev, but got no answer.
Is there any way for me to see how many incoming packets were dropped on a udp
socket due to overflowing the input buffer?  I specifically want this
information on a per-socket basis.
Thanks,
Chris
