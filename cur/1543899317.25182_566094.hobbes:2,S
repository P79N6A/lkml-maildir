The last time someone (I think Akira Iguchi) wanted to add
a new powerpc specific IDE driver, that was rejected based
on the argument that drivers/ide/ is going away soon. Most
current distros have already moved over to using libata
exclusively.

It's certainly not easy to support all ATA chips that
have special capabilities and bugs, but the electra and the
mpc8349-itx both seem to support only the most basic ATA
PIO mode anyway, which does not require much special
handling beyond finding the right mmio addresses.
