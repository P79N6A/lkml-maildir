I think what Jeff is saying is that the information goes in /proc/$MODULE,
where $MODULE is substituted with the name the driver registers; rather
than the literal "/proc/module" directory with subdirs in it.  If this is
the case, I think it's an elegant model.  Some drivers are already doing
this by hand (eg. /proc/ftape).
If, however, the suggestion is to use /proc/module (sorry, I did not read
the patch yet), then I would agree with the posters; the name would be a
source of confusion ("why is it in /proc/module/floppy!?  I built it into
the kernel!").  Perhaps /proc/driver/$NAME would be a better choice.
