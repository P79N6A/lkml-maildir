Hm, no, that doesn't make sense. Who would limit userspace memory?
Perhaps "Physical RAM/Userspace tradeoff" would be more appropriate, and
select
1GB RAM/3GB Userspace
2GB RAM/2GB Userspace
3GB RAM/1GB Userspace
4GB RAM/192MB Userspace
or something like that, and there certainly has to be documentation.
BTW: Is it really still necessary for the kernel to access all the
phyiscal RAM? I understand that it has to access memory mapped IO, and
it's own address space, but the rest? I can't see such a design in the
68k architecture specific part, or am I just missing something?
