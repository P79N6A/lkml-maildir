Thanks for doing this, Roland.  I was going to get to it in a few days.
Unfortunately, it's going to conflict in a few textual ways with one or
two of the [RFC] patches I posted.
Martin, how can we make this easiest for you?  Do you want to merge
Roland's fully-fledged MSI-X patch and put out a new -test release that
I can send half-baked PCI-E patches against until everybody's happy with
the outcome?

he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
