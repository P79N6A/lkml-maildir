Yupp.  And you'll notice that we're almost there for block devices
already.

Well, users can do that if it makes their live easier.  The kernel
doesn't need nor should know about this split internally.  There's
a few legacy interfaces left that hardcode this split, but it's
okay - no one expects the major/minor split to have more meaning
than __low/__high anyway - we already have far too many subsystems
that hand out ranges (or in the case of sound individual dev_t s)
to drivers.

It might be a wise idea to not use them to avoid subtile driver
breakage unless we do a full audit, yes.
