Well let's see:
100ppm is 100 HZ/Megahertz
+/- 0.000100 for every second
There are 3600 * 24 = 86,400 seconds in a day
86,400 * 0.000100 = 8.64 seconds per day if the drift is all in
the same direction, and continuous.
The provided log showed that the system clock was typically -14 seconds
per day, roughly twice that. So it's not, as you say, "pure theory".
The instruction manual for the Motorola MC146818A Realtime clock
chip states that the clock is guaranteed to be within +/- 5 seconds
per day with a "typical" drift of +/- 2 seconds. Of course now-days,
some cheaper noname clone with a built-in battery is often used.
The "crystal" in my ASUS P2B-DS AGP Mainboard is an integrated "Clock"
chip, guaranteed to start at 2.8 volts and be able to drive 10 "ttl" 
loads. There isn't even a drift specification! Generally, as a CPU
clock or PLL reference from which the CPU clock is derived, nobody
cares.

Well you can measure it. NIST provides a good reference that, at the
end-point, is accurate to within a second. It is derived from a clock
that has been defined to be "exact". i.e., the standard.
