Subject: [PATCH][2.4.28-pre3] 3c59x builtin NIC on Asus Pundit-R
I have 24 boxes with the same hardware and all require the patch 
attached to Andreas' e-mail to function. After abusing one of them for 2 
days continuously the nic hasn't shown a single flaw so far ;^)
I thus would like to conclude that this patch is a valid and worthfull 
addition to the 2.4.28+ kernels, as it applies cleanly to 2.4.28-final.
