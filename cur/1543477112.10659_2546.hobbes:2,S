Nope.  qmail runs great as an exploder, but put on the "hub" system and
having exploders would become pointless, as it sends out each message once
per recipient[1].
That would not be nice in this case.

[1] DJB claims it's a design decision.  I think it's more like "Help!  My
    queue design makes it difficult to do, so I'll attach a per-recipient 
    header instead."
