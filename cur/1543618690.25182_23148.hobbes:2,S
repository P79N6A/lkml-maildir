main()
{
        int i = 100 * 1000 * 1000;
        while (i--)
                getpid();
}
With cli:
	./a.out  22.05s user 15.31s system 99% cpu 37.361 total
without cli: 
	./a.out  18.29s user 17.42s system 99% cpu 35.731 total
That's 4.6%.  Intel P3.
It's also 306 cycles per iteration.  So the cli added 14 cycles.
