Yes. You want uswsusp to work in situations where swsusp worked.

WTF? So allocate larger swap partition. You just told me disks are big
enough.

That's a feature. If you are booting from live CD, you _want_ to erase
any hibernation image.

Of course you have that option. Writing image is done in userspace, so
you are free to write it to raw partition (and first versions indeed
done that).
