Well, I've made a bit of a mess. The setup that has not the delay when
the card is out is a plain 2.6.21.2 (without suspend ordering). 
The lockup ocurred on a 2.6.21.1 WITH the suspend ordering patch, but
was just one time, after I plugged and unplugged the card several time.
Could not reproduce it, however. Puzzled.
