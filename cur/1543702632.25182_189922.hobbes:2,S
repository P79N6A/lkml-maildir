I've seen this effect on 2.2. kernels from 2.2.20 to 2.2.25 (not tested
earlier 2.2 kernels). Things work fine on all recent 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
including 2.4.24 and 2.6.1.

Where did this interpretation come from? The ELF standard (1.2) I'm looking at
from: 
http://x86.ddj.com/ftp/manuals/tools/elf.pdf
 says for PT_LOAD sections
(page 41 of that document).
PT_LOAD
The array element specifies a loadable segment, described by p_filesz
and p_memsz. The bytes from the file are mapped to the beginning of the memory
segment. If the segment's memory size (p_memsz) is larger than the file size
(p_filesz), the "extra'' bytes are defined to hold the value 0 and to follow the
segment's initialized area. The file size may not be larger than the memory
size. Loadable segment entries in the program header table appear in ascending
order, sorted on the p_vaddr member.

Yes, that is how I read the standard, too - and how 2.4 and 2.6 do it.

Of course. I only posted the section headers in case the program headers
didn't give enough information to some people.
