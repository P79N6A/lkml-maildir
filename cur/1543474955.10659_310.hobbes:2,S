It's not a very usual message, but I don't think it can do
any harm.
You should try keeping your kernel source under CVS, since
CVS mangles the revision numbers in some files I always
get about a dozen or so .rej files when patching the kernel.
All I have to do is check the files if there's anything
except revision numbers in them -- and remove them if
that's all :)
