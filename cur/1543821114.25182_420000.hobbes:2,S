Dear friend, 
I can understand how surprise this letter will mean to you, but would advice that you consider it as
a request from a family in dare need of assistance. My name is Steven D. Alamieyeseigha, son of the
embattled Governor of Bayelsa state-Nigeria, my dad was arrested on the 16 September 2005 in United
Kingdom with allegations of money laundering. 
I got your contact information from your country's trade journal during my search for a reliable and
God-fearing person that can assist my family. I quite believe on my own that you can be of great
help in this regard even if I am not acquainted to you before. I am contacting you to solicite for
your assistance in helping my family to receive the sum of $11 million US Dollars for safe keeping,
we are also willing to invest this money in your country, since the United Kingdom and Nigeria
Governments are still investigating my father's case. 
You can find more details about my dad's arrest through this website:

Please! Send your reply to my private email address which is: mr_stevenalamieyeseigha01@yahoo.it 
for security reasons.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Best regards, 
Steven .D Alamieyeseigha.
