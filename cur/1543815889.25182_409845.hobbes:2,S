No, you don't need to dream up all the possible interface bits ahead of 
time.  With a la carte interfaces, you can take what you need now, and 
add features later.  You don't need an ABI for features.  You need it 
for compatibility.  You will need to update the hypervisor ABI.  And you 
can't force people to upgrade their kernels.
And much of this is so low level, that a C API for it just doesn't make 
sense.  This code is completely hidden from Linux development to begin 
with, tucked away in the low level sub-arch layer.
