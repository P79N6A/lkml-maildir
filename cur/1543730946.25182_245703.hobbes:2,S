And if an unaware application reads the compound file
and then writes it out again, does the filesystem
interpret the contents and create the other streams ?
Unless I overlook something (please tell me what), the
scheme just proposed requires filesystems to look at
the content of files that is being written out, in
order to make the streams work.
