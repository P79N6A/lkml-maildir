Its expensive on IA64. Is it any less expensive on x86?

ia64-lock-bitops.patch defines:
static __inline__ void
clear_bit_unlock (int nr, volatile void *addr)
{
       __u32 mask, old, new;
       volatile __u32 *m;
       CMPXCHG_BUGCHECK_DECL
       m = (volatile __u32 *) addr + (nr >> 5);
       mask = ~(1 << (nr & 31));
       do {
               CMPXCHG_BUGCHECK(m);
               old = *m;
               new = old & mask;
       } while (cmpxchg_rel(m, old, new) != old);
}
/**
 * __clear_bit_unlock - Non-atomically clear a bit with release
 *
 * This is like clear_bit_unlock, but the implementation may use a non-atomic
 * store (this one uses an atomic, however).
 */
#define __clear_bit_unlock clear_bit_unlock
A non atomic store is a misaligned store on IA64. That is not 
relevant here. The data is properly aligned. I guess it was intended to
refer to the cmpxchg.
How about this patch? [Works fine on IA64 simulator...]
IA64: Slim down __clear_bit_unlock
__clear_bit_unlock does not need to perform atomic operations on the variable.
Avoid a cmpxchg and simply do a store with release semantics. Add a barrier to
be safe that the compiler does not do funky things.
