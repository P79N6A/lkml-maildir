	I think that offering a link to the source code every place one puts a link
to the object code would certainly be considered 'accompanying' the source
with the object. If they're in substantially the same place and accessed by
substantially the same procedure, I think they're accompanying each other.
	Do I really want to be forced to download the linux kernel source just to
download a boot disk image?
