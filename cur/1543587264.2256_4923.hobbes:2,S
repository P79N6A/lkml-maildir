_That_ socket which was stuck must show this behaviour.
To get this on new socket you should leave session idle for >2hours
until the first keeplaive. After this it will never probe under
any curcumstances. The bug was that keepalive corrupts state of timer
and probe0 timer is not started after this.

It is known linuxism. If the ratio connection_mss/link_mtu less than ~1/4
or connection is flood with tiny packets, after rcvbuf is full linux
enters memory paranoia mode pretending that all the packets are lost.
Ugly, unpleasant, but luckily harmless under any normal curcumstances.
One way to workaround is to set rx_copybreak on ethernet drivers to 400-500.
The bug is really difficult. It is not cured even in current 2.4
(only with zerocopy patch).

If socket has ever sent keepalive, it will not be able to send zero window
probes after this.
