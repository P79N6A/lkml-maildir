one solution is to use the local_irq_*_nort() API variants - but it all
depends on why you had to disable interrupts.
Almost always irq-disabling done in conjunction with spinlocks, and the
spin_lock_irq*() variants do not disable interrupts on PREEMPT_RT. I
kept the assymetry of the local_irq*() APIs because in most cases they
are used directly interrupts need to be disabled.
it is also the more conservative approach, since we'll get messages like
the ones you got when it's unsafe to do it - while if local_irq_*() APIs
didnt disable interrupts we'd never know about the cases when they
_must_ be disabled.)
but yes, there's some API assymetry - which mostly comes from the fact
alone that 99.999% of the kernel is now preemptible. There's just so
much we can do to pretend that this is good'old Linux kernel semantics
:-)
