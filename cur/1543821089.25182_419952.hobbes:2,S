For kernel development, you don't necessary need to start from the CPU
manuals. Starting from the kernel code would be more efficient. Then,
once you feel you really need to get specific CPU knowledge, take a look
at its manual. Generally, the i386 manual + some experience with this
CPU will be enough to understand most code. Newer x86 CPUs reuse the
same instruction set and model, and add a few instructions and memory
models. Also, it might be wise to get basic knowledge on the PC
architecture if you don't have right now (I/O, mem, DMA, PCI, IRQs, ...). 
Hoping this helps,
Willy
