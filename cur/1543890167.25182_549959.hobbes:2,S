Yeah, I think doing all the above in the block layer is the cleanest way
to solve this.  If write back cache && flush doesn't work, barrier is
bound to fail but block layer still can write the barrier block as
requested (without actual barriering), whine about it to the user, and
tell the FS that barrier is failed but the write itself went through, so
that FS can go on without caring about it unless it wants to.

Yeap.

I think we can give this property to zero length barriers.

Barrier code as it currently stands deals with two colors so there can
be only one outstanding barrier at given moment.  Expanding it to deal
with multiple colors and then to multiple simultaneous groups will take
some work but is definitely possible.  If FS people can make good use of
it, I think it would be worthwhile.

Yeah, on device side, the best we can do most of the time is full flush
but as long as request queue depth is much deeper than the
controller/device one, having multiple barrier groups can be helpful.
We need more input from FS people, I think.

If the NV RAM can be reliably detected using one of the inquiry pages,
sd driver can switch it to DRAIN automatically.

How about exporting ordered mode as sysfs attribute and configuring it
using a udev rule?  It's a device property after all.
Thanks.
