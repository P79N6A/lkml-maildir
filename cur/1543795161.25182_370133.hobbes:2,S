There is a much much better way to do it than just user space and
without hitting cr3/cr4 - put "lock works" in the PAT and while we'll
have to add PAT support which we need to do anyway we would get a world
where on uniprocessor lock prefix only works on addresse targets we want
it to - ie pci_alloc_consistent() pages.
