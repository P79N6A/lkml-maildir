The coherent case on ARM is broken in more ways, not only because
it uses kmalloc, but it also takes no notice of the DMA mask.
However, AT91 isn't a coherent ARM architecture, so arch_is_coherent()
should be false.  Therefore, we should never be allocating pages for
DMA from SLAB/SLUB for AT91 platforms.
