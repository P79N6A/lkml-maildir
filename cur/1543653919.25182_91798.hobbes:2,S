What do you mean? My lilo.conf obviously uses the "long"
names, because the short ones doesn't exist. It has
been like that since I started using devfs long ago.
The kernel don't deal in names when it tries to mount root though,
it tries to mount device 03:04 or 09:00
That works with 2.5.47 and all earlier 2.5 kernels, but not 2.5.48.
