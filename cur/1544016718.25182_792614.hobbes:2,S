While it is not SMP, I still have one or two working i386 (and
a compatible AMD) system around.
Back in the days where I ran them the last time, there were two
issues:
  * Debian's baseline libc is compiled to use LOCK and some other
    newish instructions that are not available on a real i386 CPU.
  * There was a patch flying around to introduce a kernel-based
    emulator for those instructions. However, this was (at that time)
    neither included in Debian's kernel, nor in the upstream sources.
