Hi All,
I'm pleased to announce the first version of the LDM Documentation.
Windows 2000 introduced a new partitioning scheme and with it, the
Logical Disk Manager.  Like Linux's Logical Volume Manager is allows
changes to partitioning, and volumes, to be made without rebooting.
To create Mirrored, Spanned, Striped or RAID disks under Win2K, you
must use their "Dynamic Disks".
Unfortunately Linux cannot read these Dynamic Disks.  Yet.
The documentation, although only a first draft, contains enough
information to locate and piece together the disks, partitions and
volumes used by Win2K.  The docs show the on-disk structures that
make up the 1MB database at the end of the physical disk.
The docs are available online at:
  
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/ldm
and to download at:
  
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13956
Also, I've written a test program to dump the LDM information stored
on a dynamic disk.  It's available at:
  
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/ldm/ldm.c
If you have any questions, comments or additions, please email me.
Thanks,
