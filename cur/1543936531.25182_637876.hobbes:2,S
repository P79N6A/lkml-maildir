Ok. Not sure why it didn't boot the first time (black screen) but it
booted the second time. This time both CPUs got initialised and are in
use, no kernel oops during init and no kernel processes stuck in D
state. Should've tried .24 earlier but .23 failed to compile under sarge
due to a buggy binutils so I figured .24 would too.
