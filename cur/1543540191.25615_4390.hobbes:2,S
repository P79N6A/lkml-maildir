The user-mode port of 2.4.0-test5 is available.
It's been updated to 2.4.0-test5.
For the adventurous, Jim Leu's virtual ethernet driver is now included in the 
patch.  It basically works, but it's not too hard to use it to truly mess up 
the kernel.  So, it's not in the binary kernels, and it's off by default in 
the configuration until we get the bugs worked out.  Once that's happened, I 
expect to get rid of the existing slip-based network interface.
This driver is a virtual ethernet interface which communicates with other 
virtual machines through an external daemon.  It can communicate with the host 
through an ethertap device and with a physical ethernet by exchanging raw 
packets with the ethernet device.
If you want to play with it, get the user-mode tools and README from the 
tools/net directory of the CVS repository at
