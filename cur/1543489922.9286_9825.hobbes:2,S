what I'm wondering for quite a while, why does the DMA window start at 1GB
(2GB with Richard's patch) and not starting from address 0 (so we could make
it up to 4GB). Is this a hardware restriction (couldn't find anything in the 
LCA documention) ? 
I've tried to set the window base to 0 on my noname, but it didn't work so
well (console was really messed up and it looked like I've got some oopses).
I haven't expected that behaviour (crashing, when doing first PCI bus master
access, would be more reasonable), so I'm not sure whether it's impossible
or just a bug anywhere.

It's a host bridge, but it should be called ghost bridge instead ;^)
