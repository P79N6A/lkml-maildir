ugh.
I guess I'm old-fashioned:  I think that the real answer is
to do the due diligence when making a patch.  Don't assume
that you/I/we can make a one-line change without checking
around/above/below it, where it's declared, allocated, etc.
I once worked with someone whose attitude was to "let the
compiler find all of the problems," so he threw quite the
garbage at it and iterated until the compiler no longer
complained.  I think that's the wrong way to do it, but
maybe it was his version of release early, release often.
