What I typically do in these cases is,
- remove the object file where the oops occurs
- rerun make
- copy the gcc line that is responsible for compiling the object
- run the same gcc line again, but add a '-g' flag
Now we have an object with debugging symbols, and can use 'objdump
--source <file>.o | less' and get something that has both the source
lines and the related assembly code. In this case the faulting
instruction is about 0x2e bytes past the beginning of nfs_print_path.
But I can get pretty far just from reading the oops and it is probably
the test you added. Ok, it looks like -O2 is actually optimizing away
some of those intermediate variables for you.

Ok, so we're comparing the contents of %eax to something that is 8 bytes
offset from the address stored in %edx. and then jump out if they are
equal.
So this is something like and if (eax != edx->bar) { } construct. And in
fact the test you added was
    if ( p - me != 0 )
    if ( p != me )
    if ( inode_parent != inode )
    if ( parent->d_inode != d->d_inode )
So the contents of either parent->d_inode or d->d_inode was stored in
register eax, and we're dereferencing the other pointer during the test
operation.
Why does it crash, because the pointer we are dereferencing is 0x7, not
really a valid address, in fact it already looks like an inode number.

And eax looks pretty suspicious as well. These are not pointers to inode
structures, but possibly the i_ino numbers.
