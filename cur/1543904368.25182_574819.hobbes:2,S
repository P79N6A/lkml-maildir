Maybe.  In this configuration, INTA of the two devices
is physically connected to the same wire on the device-side
of the interrupt re-mapper -- so you'd have to change the configuration.
If you have an IOAPIC and can enable it, that will not hurt --
though unless something else changes, these devices are still
tied together on the device-side of the  mapper.
So if you can physically move one of the devices to another slot
that is your best bet.
I'd need a bunch of info from your system to tell you what
you can do ahead of time, including full dmesg, lspci -vv
and acpidump.
