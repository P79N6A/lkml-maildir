Yes, but then it enables interrupts at one point.
And I'm not saying that is wrong - I'm saying that the warning is really 
because you didn't tell the kernel that it was _not_ wrong. The warning is 
a "I got called with interrupts disabled, not nobody actually told me that 
I shouldn't reschedule. I will refuse to reschedule (exactly because 
interrupts weren't enabled), but I don't like the fact that somebody 
apparently did things behind my back".
Think of the kernel as a grumpy girlfriend that you just stood up, and 
bring flowers next time.
