Sorry to nitpick this, but the doc. should include an
'=' sign like the ones before and after it:
  	edb=		[HW,PS2]
+
+	edd		[EDD]
+			Format: {"of[f]" | "sk[ipmbr]"}
+			See comment in arch/i386/boot/edd.S
in edd.S:
+	movb	$0, (EDD_MBR_SIG_NR_BUF)	# zero value at EDD_MBR_SIG_NR_BUF
+	movb	$0, (EDDNR)			# zero value at EDDNR
Such obvious comments aren't needed, even if they were just
moved from other places....
Rest of the .S code makes sense to me.
