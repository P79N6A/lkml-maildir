I have to agree that the impact is small even for the people using ISO recv - 
I happen to use it quite frequently and it hasn't locked up on me yet. So I 
certainly don't need it fixed atm. It's just the "dmesg annoyance" if you 
will, to deal with :) !

OTOH, if it allocates so much of memory while irqs disabled and holding locks, 
isn't there a  good chance for the allocator to sleep and things to go wrong?
