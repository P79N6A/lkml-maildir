AFAIK, the checks were fixed before anyone was blackholed. According
to the ORBS site, the check involves sending a message, which has to
be received before the site is deemed to be an open relay.
The old tests simply checked whether the server accepted the message,
regardless of whether it delivered or discarded it.
