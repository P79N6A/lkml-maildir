If you use decl_subsys(), you should be fine for this.  Use that instead
of trying to roll your own subsystem kobjects please.  That
infrastructure was written for a reason...

Data (kobjects) have a different lifespan than code (modules).
Seperating them is a good idea, and if not, your reference counting
issues can be quite nasty.  See the recent EDAC fiasco for a good
example of how easy it is to mess things up in this manner.
