Yeah, but I have few ascii art graphs, as well as notes and points, that
would look funny if you don't have 8 character tabs.
But If the standand is to have tabs, then I would convert all 8
consecutive spaces to use tabs.  But the original document had a mix of
tabs and spaces that just looked horrible on different editors.  So I
decided to use spaces since that is more consistent, in the look.
But if this is not the norm, I'll supply a patch, otherwise I'll let it
be.
