Hallo, 
I want write a driver for a Z8530  Serial Card. 
This chip is very different to the 8250/16550 Chips. 
My idee is, to integrate the driver in the serial.c. 
My routines emulate a 16550 or aquivalent, so that the 
main routines, are not changed. 
My question is that ok, or it's bette to write/change 
a own extra modul for the z8530 family, over all achitectures?
It's ok to write a z8530 modul what imported/used  from the
serial modul ?
Pleas, giv me comment's
