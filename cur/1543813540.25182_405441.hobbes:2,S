this would basically make edac a place to report "help something went to
the gutter". Sure. I see that useful. 
In fact there are 3 layers then
1) low level "do check" function
2) per bus code that calls the do check functions and whatever is needed
for bus checks
3) "EDAC" central command, which basically gathers all failure reports
and does something with them (push them to userspace or implement the
userspace chosen policy (panic/reboot/etc))
having 1) separate from 2) is useful, it means that drivers can do
synchronous checks in addition to the checks in 2) which will tend to be
asynchronous....
