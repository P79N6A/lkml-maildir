What about move of resume_device setup somewhere sooner?

Hmm, I'm still on 2.6.9, but this code did not change much. I'll
generate it.

Single shell script would probably do no harm, but then, you want this
to go into mainline, not into Debian kernel, right? ;-).
Actually freezing processes is good thing to do even for normal
resume. We pretty much know there are no harmfull processes running
there, but better safe than sorry.
