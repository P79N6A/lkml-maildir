It will also give gcml2 conniptions trying to figure out a set of constraints
which will enforce the intended behaviour.  Please please don't.
If there are any loops (and I don't know of any) then the logic is broken and
needs to be fixed, not enforced through clever tricks.

I will look, but I seem to remember that this code was just broken when
Keith Owens was trying to make it work in kbuild 2.5.

The problem is deciding what the original rules were supposed to mean, and
then reproducing that behaviour exactly in the new language.  The alternative
is fixing the problems as we convert, but then we end up with CML2 and the
"there's no way to verify the rulebase is the same" argument.
