I noticed these in dmesg after running "glxgears":
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_pci_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_pci_cmdbuffer called without lock held
[drm:via_cmdbuffer] *ERROR* via_cmdbuffer called without lock held
I was able to intermittently reproduce the messages by launching
glxgears and moving the window around.
