Right. I guessed that given the gazillion helper functions and wanted to 
know how to address this in the right way.

Ok will look at that. Note that this is not unique to _write_lock_irqsave 
but all other locks that disable interrupts seem to have the same issue. 
We are likely going to duplicate a lot of functions.
