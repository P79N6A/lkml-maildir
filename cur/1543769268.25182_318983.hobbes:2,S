Ah..OK, that is probably why, I've put the macros which would be
expanded in the first level in a separate header because it will
probably be shared amongst many drivers. Although I still don't see
where SENSOR_blah is coming from at all at the moment, if you can
track that down I'd be interested to know if its just something to do
with the script or a problem with the patch.

Ok, I'll have a look at it later.

Well I said mainly singletons :-), some of the attributes don't
benefit from the dynamic sysfs callbacks simply because they already
only use one callback for a few different attributes, I believe that's
the case with the non-singletons in this case.
