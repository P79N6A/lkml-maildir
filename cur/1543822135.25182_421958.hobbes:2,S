The interface might not be right here.
- I think "lhs" and "rhs" would be better names than "start" and "end". 
  After all, we don't _know_ that the caller is using the two times as a
  start and an end.  The caller might be taking the difference between two
  differences, for example.
- The existing timespec and timeval funtions tend to do return-by-value. 
  So this would become
	static inline struct timespec timespec_sub(struct timespec lhs,
							struct timespec rhs)
  (and given that it's inlined, the added overhead of passing the
  arguments by value will be zero)
- If we don't want to do that then at least let's get the arguments in a
  sane order:
	static inline void timespec_sub(struct timespec *result,
				struct timespec lhs, struct timespec rhs)
