A jiffy counter is sufficient for the X server; all I need is some
indication that time has passed with a resolution of 10 to 20 ms. I
check this after each X request is processed as that is the scheduling
granularity. An X request can range in time from .1us to 100 seconds, so
I really want to just check after each request rather than attempt some
heuristic.
