commit b4b6cda2298b0c9a0af902312184b775b8867c65 upstream
We should only tell the hardware its capable of DMA'ing
to us only what we asked dev_alloc_skb(). Prior to this
it is possible a large RX'd frame could have corrupted
DMA data but for us but we were saved only because we
were previously also pci_map_single()'ing the same large
value. The issue prior to this though was we were unmapping
a smaller amount which the prior DMA patch fixed.
