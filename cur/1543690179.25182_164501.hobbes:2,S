| Randy, you have looked into related perl scripts. Is the result of
| checkconfig.pl reliable?
They aren't perfect.  I consider them more like 80-90% solutions.
Usable until there's a better solution IMO, like maybe sparse.
The perl scripts don't look at other #included files to check if they
supply any of the needed #defines.  I.e., they look only at the one
file being searched to check if it uses names (CONFIG_*) without
#include-ing config.h in this case, so it can produce false positives.
I looked quickly at crypto/tcrypt.c (which is listed as needing config.h).
It #includes linux/init.h, which #includes linux/config.h.
I expect that there are several...or many like this.
