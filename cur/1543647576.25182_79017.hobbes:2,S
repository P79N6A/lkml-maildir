sorry for the posting it the second time. i had missed the subject the first 
time.
I am trying to debug a kernel over a remote serial console. I get 
Ignoring packet error .. 
kgdb page suggests that it might be due to the speed mismatch. i tried 
stty ispeed 9600 ospeed 9600 < /dev/ttyS0 
on the development machine and have passed serial=0,9600n8 option and 
gdbbaud=9600 via lilo to the debug kernel. 
when i run 
%stty speed 
on the development machine it still reports 38400. 
so i changed the gdbbaud and serial= values to 38400 on the test machine. even 
this doesn't work. 
any ideas
--sridhar
ps: i have tried redirecting the kernel messages( without patching it with 
kgdb) over the serial line and read it with minicom . that works fine. 
please email as i am not subscribed.
