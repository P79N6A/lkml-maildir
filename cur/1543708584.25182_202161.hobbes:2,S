Well, I cut-n-paste it into drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.c (which must
have been the place it fits in 2.6). Get this compile failures:
drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.c: In function `acpi_power_off':
drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.c:30: warning: implicit declaration of
function `apicid_to_phys_cpu_present'
drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.c:30: error: invalid operands to binary &
drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.c:69: warning: implicit declaration of
function `disable_IO_APIC'
make[3]: *** [drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [drivers/acpi/sleep] Error 2
make[1]: *** [drivers/acpi] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
But I'm sure a patch like yours for 2.6 would have fixed my, since using
a non-smp kernel works everytime :) Anyway, thanks for your efforts,
hope someone will get this fixed soon :)
Best regards,
Stian
