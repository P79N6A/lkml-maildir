Not scsi disk info.  (Or maybe it should be there but it isn't.)  And no,
it doesn't work for me because it's owned by the scsi core, not my driver.

I don't think it would be appropriate to use that directory, since my 
driver wouldn't own it.
How about creating a /sys/class/usb/usb-storage/ directory, under which
there could be a directory for each USB mass-storage device?  Or would it 
be better to create a usb-storage.# directory under the interface's 
directory in /sys/devices/ ?
It's worth pointing out that both the OHCI and EHCI drivers also do the
same wrong thing.  They create their attribute files in a directory
owned by the PCI driver.
