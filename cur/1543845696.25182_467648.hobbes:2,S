Be sure to spell out, if you haven't already, that there is just a
single container hierarchy, with each task attached to a single
container in that hierarchy, and each subsystem (e.g. cpusets)
adding its own special files to the common container hierarchy
directories.
It is not the case that each subsystem using containers gets to
concoct its own hierarchy, independent of any other subsystem.

I wonder if this should be a configurable ... perhaps not.
If someone configures in one or more of the subsystems, such as
cpusets, that requires CONTAINERS, then we need to enable containers.
Otherwise we don't need to enable CONTAINERS.  I don't see what
user input we need here specific to CONTAINERS.

Perhaps time for another log line here, such as:

Delete extra tab after semi-colon on parent line.

(Yes - this pertains to something this you took as is from the current
cpuset docmentation ...)  Please don't use 'none' for this argument to
mount.  Use some string relevant to the type of filesystem being
mounted.  This argument shows up in error messages from mount, and as
it notes in the mount(8) man page, when speaking of the proc file
system, though it applies here too:
       The  proc file system is not associated with a special device, and when
       mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such as proc can be used instead  of
       a  device specification.  (The customary choice none is less fortunate:
       the error message `none busy' from umount can be confusing.)
For example, make the above:
       mount -t container container /dev/container

                  I won't rest till it's the best ...
