I'm on this side of the fence too.  There are some vendors whose gear 
I will not knowingly buy, memorex being one of them after I got a 
device damaged by a power surge from nearby lightning, and was 
summarily told by the telephone support dweebs that they did NOT 
support linux, and that my warranty was worthless if it was ever 
hooked to a linux box.  Hieing myself back to the dealer, he tried it 
on a windows box, and it indeed was broken as far as the passthru was 
concerned, but it almost made a picture so that was good enough for 
them and I was told to go piss up a rope.
We should, and really, no dis-respect for Marc is intended here, 
demand that the drivers furnished for linux be 100% open source.
I have an nvidia card, but run the nv driver for exactly that reason.
