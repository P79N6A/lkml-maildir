- check the pci version (I'm pretty sure these were pre PCI 2.0 ?)
- check for dmi existance
  DMI came after VLB didn't it?  Even if not, the BIOS date may
  give clues. I don't recall VLB after 1996 or so.
- check for acpi existance.
  surely no-one made an acpi aware vlb machine :)
There are probably other creative ways.
