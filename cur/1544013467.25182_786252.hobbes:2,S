Linux relies on unsigned long to behave like atomic for read/write.

@@ -21,6 +21,9 @@ local_t is very similar to atomic_t. If the counter is per CPU and only
 updated by one CPU, local_t is probably more appropriate. Please see
 Documentation/local_ops.txt for the semantics of local_t.
 
+unsigned long can be used instead of atomic_t, if all you
+need is atomic setting and atomic reading.

 The first operations to implement for atomic_t's are the initializers and
 plain reads.
