s390 and sparc64 allows a modular BINFMT_ELF32, which #includes
fs/binfmt_elf.c after redefining various things.  But I suspect the
right fix for this is to disallow building it modular..
For arch/ia64/kernel/mca.c you're right.  Other mca files can be built
modular and need odd symbols aswell, but mca.c is always built in.
