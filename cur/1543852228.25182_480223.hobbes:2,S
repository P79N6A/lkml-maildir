I hadn't noticed that -mm patch.  I'll take a look.  Up to now, device-mapper
(via dmsetup) and xfs (via xfs_freeze, which dates from before device-mapper
handled this automatically) were the only users.  Only one freeze should be
issued at once.  A freeze is a temporary thing, normally used while creating a
snapshot.  (One problem we still have is lots of old documentation on the web
advising people to run xfs_freeze before creating device-mapper snapshots.)
You're right that the down_trylock idea is more trouble than it's worth and
should be scrapped.
