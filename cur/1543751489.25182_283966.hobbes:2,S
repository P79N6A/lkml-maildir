wouldn't this be easier in user space using "ps H" then one of two options
happens depending on the use of fork and other issues (making the question
hard to answer as stated) either A: they will all have the same PID or
B:they will all have varying PIDs in the later case you could use looks
for all PIDs sharing the same ancestor PPID (depending on how far down you
are in the fork list)
