I'd expect that a lot of these problems could be reduced by simply pausing
for a while in the crash handler, wait for I/O to complete.
Other times these failures point at flaws and dubious assumptions in
drivers themselves, fixing of which tends to collaterally help platform
power mangement operations.
However, I expect that it will always be the case that setups which try to
perform crashdumps to their main production disks will be less reliable
than setups which set aside hardware for the dumping.
If it was me, and if I really cared about reliable dumps, I'd make sure
that each machine had a $6 NIC set aside for crashdumping, and the dump
kernel uses that NIC for an NFS dump and has no other device drivers
configured.
