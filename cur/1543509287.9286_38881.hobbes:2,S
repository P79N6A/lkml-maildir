Some drivers are able to share interrupts.  However you might consider
using multiple GPIOs for each device IRQs if performance is critical.
Note that if you use GPIOs above 10, they will all trigger the IRQ 11 in
the CPU which requires all drivers to share IRQ 11, even if the GEDR show
them separately.
