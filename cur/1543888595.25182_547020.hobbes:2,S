What policy would that be?
The mapping is set by root from userspace, not by the kernel.
The same for ownership to crtc devices. The kernel may have to
provide some default so "init=/bin/sh" will work, that's all.

Sure.  Not multiseat by default, as the kernel can't know which output
goes with which keyboard. All I want it a system that allows
multiseat for those that care to set it up.

Sure.  Well, when using multiple screens as a single user, then I
don't want cloning. I want a multi-screen desktop.  The laptop
user with a video projector is about the one case I know
where cloning is wanted.
Unfortunately the kernel can't always know which outputs are in
use, so I see how cloning may have to be the default. :-/
