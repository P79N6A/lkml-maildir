Same thing here with a Promise SX6000 RAID controller (P4, 1GB RAM,
system is completely on RAID, 2.4.20-pre10-ac1). But, this seems not to
be related. At least in my case, it's the controller that causes the
stalls, 'cause only processes depending on file IO (including swap) get
into D state. Everything else just runs fine.
