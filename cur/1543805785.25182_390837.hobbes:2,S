We don't make that assumption.  What we do is:
- map the current sg using kmap_atomic()
- copy up to sg->length into or out of that mapping
- unmap current sg
- if we have reached the end of this sg, move on to the next
What this means is that we assume sg->offset + sg->length <= PAGE_SIZE
in all cases, which is the same assumption architecture DMA code makes.
If that's invalid, there's likely to be a lot of architecture DMA support
which is broken.
