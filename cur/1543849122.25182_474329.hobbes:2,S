Some discussion on both FreeBSD and Linux mailing lists suggests that
ignoring TIME_WAIT has some risk to it, so that may not be an
advisable path to take.  However, there are probably some cases where
it is safe, such as idle timeouts, where the client is certain there
is no traffic in flight.
Both client implementations (kernel and glibc) should re-use port
numbers or connections aggressively.  To that end, the kernel RPC
client is already doing this.  I know Red Hat has suggested using a
connection manager for user-level RPC applications to share.  In
addition the kernel NFS client is sharing connections to a server
between all mount points going to that server.
