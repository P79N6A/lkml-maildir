It is a problem on all platforms that currently implement MSI.

Which hardware is this a problem for?
MSI and MSI-X only guarantee the availability of 1 irq if I recall
correctly.  More are a bonus so cards should be able to fall back
to a single irq mode.

Examples? details? patches?
Part of the problem with plain MSI is that you can't mask irqs at the
source, in a generic way.
How do your ideas compare with my hypertransport irq implementation?
