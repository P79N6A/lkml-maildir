Heck no.  TASK A will be run until it either blocks or its time quantum
drops below TASK B's.  It does not matter how many times it calls
schedule(), 'cept its a darn waste of time.
Now, it you call sched_yield() your chances are higher, but still no
guarantee.  If you get the tasks out of SCHED_OTHER sched_yield() will
do the above (if they have the same priority).
