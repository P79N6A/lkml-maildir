I have a ~1TB filesystem that fails to mount, the message is:
EXT3-fs error (device loop0): ext3_check_descriptors: Block bitmap for
group 2338 not in group (block 1607003381)!
EXT3-fs: group descriptors corrupted !
A day before, it worked flawlessly.
What could have happened, and what's the best course of action?
