Hi.
Even in 2.6.12rc5 the vm-problem is still there. On a gigabit-webserver, when it reaches around 4000 
downloaders, it slows-down immediately. Its no fs-issue or disk-issue because the lock-ups also 
happen when I try to open a file on /proc. Normally it needs no time to open it but when it reaches 
4000 sockets, it needs from 5-30 seconds to just open a "file". Its a dual Xeon with 8 GB Ram. Any idea?
