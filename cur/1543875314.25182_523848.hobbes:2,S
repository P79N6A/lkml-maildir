And after everything, it's a heisenbug -- I repeatably get that lost
interrupts message on stock 2.6.21-rc4 but never on -rt1 with
CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE.
Any suggestion of where to look?  My /proc/latency_trace stays
stubbornly empty -- are there any sysctls I need to change from their
default to get latency tracing?  I'm a complete noob when it comes to
the -rt patch, so I'm not sure what the right way to use the tracing
infrastructure to track down this lost rtc interrupts issue is.
Thanks, 
  Roland
