If you so desire, you can probably workaround this by doing:
echo 100 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established
Of course, then if you don't type in an SSH window for 5 minutes, it evaporates
on you - and even SSH keepalives don't help if a router takes a nose dive and
it takes 2 minutes for our NOC to slap it upside the head.  This is a case
*against* keepalives there - if a router hiccups and drops a keepalive on an
otherwise idle session, you nuke a perfectly good idle session for reasons
totally contrary to the original purpose of TCP, namely to *survive* such a
router burp.
