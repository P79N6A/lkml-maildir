Subject: Linus's VM: Evil swap frenzy (64M RAM):  Stuck in freeing/swapping?

	Hi, I'm have test1-linux-2.2.0-pre2, and about 3 times my machine has
swapped out 10MB for no reason.  The system was unuseable (the cursor
wouldn't move in X) for about 7 seconds.  When this occurred tonight, I
finally ended with a situation like this:
telomere:~> free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:         63412      39212      24200      13084        780     
21184
-/+ buffers/cache:      17248      46164
Swap:        34236       8724      25512
	Before I could run 'free' (a few seconds), about 1.5 MB was swapped
BACK IN (i.e 10-8.5=1.5).  But you can see that, with 24M free, there is
was no need to swap out anything!
	The last time this happened, X was swapped out (with kernel 2.1.132 I
think), but it did NOT get swapped back in.  I also had about 24Mb free,
but whenever I moved an xterm, the system would swap in furiously, and
would use something like 10MB of RAM (according to xosview 1.6.1), which
would be freed immediately after I stopped moving the window.  Spooky.
	Anybody have any idea why this is happening?
