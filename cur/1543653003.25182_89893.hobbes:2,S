The clock speeds of i386 may very well now be up to the point where its
clock speeds dominate all other considerations. But I've never seen
large-scale i386 machines used in what numerics I've been involved in,
which, granted, was not much and several years ago (SGI dominated).
I'm still somewhat skeptical given the cpu counts, process address
space, and I/O architecture limitations on i386, but I don't honestly
care. Numerics is not my game anymore if it ever was, and whatever
additional functionality might come out of cleanups is only ammunition
to push the cleanups to me.
