Yes, yes.  You know he's using Red Hat and I know he's using Red Hat.
But it really bugs me when someone uses the term 'Linux 6.2'.... (:
I could not resist pointing out the distinction.

I think I prefer 'apt-get source finger'. (: If you set it up for the
cdrom or multi-cdrom methods it will prompt you to put the right CD in.
The advantage/disadvantage is that it unpacks into the current dir.  Oh
well, guess this isn't a distro advocacy list. (:

Or just use '*' instead of '\t'..
