copy_to_user() returns the number of bytes NOT copied.
same for copy_from_user().
This is a common mistake and your code using this functions should
look like this:
if (copy_from_user(to,uptr,size)) {
   return -EFAULT;
}
/* Do some processing */
if (copy_to_user(uptr,from,size)) {
   return -EFAULT;
}
PS: CC'ed linux-kernel, that you will not get 1000 answers ;-)
