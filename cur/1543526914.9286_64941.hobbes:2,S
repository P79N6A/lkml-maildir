What if I have hundreds of sockets to check? The old way select/poll
let me know which ones to read/recv from and I could take it from
there. Because, select/poll do no return here, I have to wait for a
timeout then try recvmsg on each one -- which slows the process down.
Am I doing this wrong?

I'm not going to get involved in this either way, I don't have the
experience -- but I would like to know how I can make existing code
work with the new kernels (if possible).

No, people do bitch about RARP from time to time, just as I've heard
complaints about proxy ARP being broken.

I completely agree -- I just want to know what there exists a recipe
for fixing existing applications that depend on the old behavior if
at all possible. I'm more than happy to document this for other people
if someone can explain it to me.

I can probably do this tomorrow if I can figure out something simple
to truss -- I don't want to do it from remote in case bad things
happen. Do you have in mind what you want truss'd -- or will
something like "main(){getpwent()};" suffice?
