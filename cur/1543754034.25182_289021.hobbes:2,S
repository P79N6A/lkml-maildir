How about a shell sort?  if the data is mostly sorted shell sort beats 
qsort lots of times, and since the data sets are often small in-kernel, 
shell sorts O(n^2) behaviour won't harm it too much, shell sort is also 
faster if the data is already completely sorted. Shell sort is certainly 
not the simplest algorithm around, but I think (without having done any 
tests) that it would probably do pretty well for in-kernel use... Then 
again, I've known to be wrong :)
