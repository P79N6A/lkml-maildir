It isn't strictly a bug.  If the ->show() op fills full PAGE_SIZE and
returns PAGE_SIZE, the user will get full PAGE_SIZE bytes correctly, so
it will work.  However, considering normal use cases, return value of
PAGE_SIZE very likely indicates an error condition, so considering it a
BUG condition is a good idea.
Miao, can you please note that the code works fine with PAGE_SIZE return
but it's likely to indicate truncated result or overflow in normal use
cases as a comment on top of the BUG_ON()?
Thanks.
