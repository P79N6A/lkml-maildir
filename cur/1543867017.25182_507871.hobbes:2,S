Rats, good point.

I did check the other trap handlers.  kernel_math_error calls die,
which calls do_exit(SIGSEGV).  This doesn't seem to allow the process
the opportunity to trap the SIGSEGV and examine the fault information.

Yup.  How does this patch look to you?  We set error_code and trap_no
for userspace faults and kernel faults which call die().  We don't set
them for kernelspace faults which are fixed up.
