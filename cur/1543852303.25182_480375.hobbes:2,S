I'd prefer:
"Another Faustian Pact between Linux and Corporate World"
Let's be real:
Do you know all papers and words between Red Hat or OSDL
and say IBM or HP?
Did you regard Novell as linux defender or guardian-angel?
Are you afraid or more afraid?
Did Microsoft ever need Novell to sue anybody? 
I don't think so.
