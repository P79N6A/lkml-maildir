Subject: [-mm PATCH 0/32] fix-up schedule_timeout() usage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello Andrew,
Sorry for the lack of a combined To:/Cc: list, but it would have been
excessive if I included everyone (I won't send all of the patches to
LKML, unless there is no other list entry in MAINTAINERS - I think that
is only 9 out of the 32 patches :)
Andrew recently added schedule_timeout_interruptible() and
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible() to the -mm tree, as
schedule_timeout() called without the state set results in an immediate
return; thus, it makes little sense to ever call it that way. Almost all
the kernel invocations of schedule_timeout(), additionally, follow:
	set_current_state(TASK_{,UN}INTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule_timeout(some_value_in_jiffies);
Andrew pointed out that creating non-inline wrappers for this common
usage should reduce the kernel size. The following 32 patches (split up
by directory/subsystem) convert the schedule_timeout() callers in
2.6.13-rc5-mm1, where appropriate.
Here's the list of patches as I split them up:
01/32: include/
02/32: fs/
03/32: kernel/
04/32: mm/
05/32: net/
