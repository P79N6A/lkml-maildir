Sascha, if you want to address Fengguang by his first name, note that 
chinese and bavarians (and some others I forgot now, too) typically use the 
order:
  lastname firstname 
when they spell their names. Another evidence is, that the name Wu is a 
pretty common chinese family name.
Fengguang, if it's the other way around, correct me please (and I'm going to 
wear a big brown paper bag for the rest of the day..).

Such a script _cannot_ exist for a mailing list. Sane mailing list software 
mangles messages in the least intrusive way and highly depend on users 
doing the right thing. In this case, that's what Sam suggested below!
