Hi,
I have a question about fork() and messages..
For simplicity, I have a parent process that forks() two child processes (say 
pid1 & pid2).
How do I set priority levels of child1 vs child2. I want child1 to have a much 
higher priority level, since its going to read inputs from a serial device in 
the outside world?
Using basic signal calls say SIGUSR1, how can I communicate (without 
semaphores) between child1 and child2 through the parent? For instance if the 
child1 gets blocked forever trying to read the serial device then I want to 
notify the parent to kill child2??
Your time in this matter is greatly appreciated.
