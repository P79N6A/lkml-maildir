Subject: [PATCH] fix bootmem allocator on machines with holes in memory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
If the memory we are trying to allocate is too large to fit in the
current region, we should skip to the end. We currently search the
available bitmap, find the area is too small, increment the start by
incr and try again. This resulted in an apparent lockup on a 64GB
machine that had a 3GB IO hole starting at 1GB (and the mem_map array
would not fit in the first region).
Also use ALIGN macro instead of an open coded version.
Anton
