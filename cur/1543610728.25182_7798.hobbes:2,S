Yup.. and the 2.5 tree really is a "toy" tree, so if Linus' impatience
shines through on that one, it's no big deal. I'm looking forward to 2.5, as
I plan to take a more active role in Linux developement now, and not just
sitting here reading lkml.
Btw, anyone having some cool stuff to donate to me? I'll start with a
Porsche (to _accelerate_ my developement).
