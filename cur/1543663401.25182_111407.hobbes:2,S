	Hi Jeff,
	I've just checked 2.5.62, and IrDA is happy (i82365 is another
story). Here is another batch of patches for 2.5.X. All those patches
have been on my web page over two months (except the IrNET fix) and
have been tested with 2.5.62.
	The remaining IrDA work before 2.6.X :
		o drivers (especially dongles)
		o skb leaks (found by Jan Kiszka and more)
        Would you mind passing those patches to Linus ?
	Have fun...
	Jean
