32-bit works great.  Unfortunately, pfmon is far too limited for serious kernel
monitoring AFAICT.  E.g. you can't select edge counting instead of cycle
counting.  So you can count how many clock cycles were spent with interrupts
disabled but you can't count how many times they were disabled.  That's too bad
because using pfmon is so easy compared to writing a program.
And is someone working on kernel profiling tools that use the perfmon2
infrastructure on i386?  I'd like to see kernel-based profiling that lets
you use something like the existing 'readprofile' to retrieve results.  This
would be a lot better than the current timer-based profiling.
