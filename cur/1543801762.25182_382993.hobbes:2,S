I didn't know it. Thanks!

Ok. This is newer one. :-)
Bye.
------------------
Fortunately, 2.6.15 includes memory hot-add function for i386 and ppc.
So, I made a patch for ia64.
This doesn't make new pgdat. All of new memory will belong to
node 0 by this patch. But this is simplest first step and best start for
future work.
I tested on my Tiger4. Please apply.
(This patch doesn't use ZONE_EASY_RECLAIM yet, because its zone will be useful
 for just hot-remove.)
