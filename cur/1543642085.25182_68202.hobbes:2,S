Yes, I would like to name partitions. I'd like to tell the kernel
to boot from root partition "John" and to 
mount -t ext2 --part Lisa /mnt/bkup without the very annoying thing
of boot and mounts failures when I add/remove phisical devices. To
do this we need partition table parsing inside the kernel IMHO.
Bye.
