Not so.  There are two different styles of big endian.  (Lets just face
it, BE is fucked in the head anyway...)
physical bus:	31...24	23...16	15...8	7...0
BE version 1 (word invariant)
  byte access	byte 0	byte 1	byte 2	byte 3
  word access	31-24	23-16	15-8	7-0
BE version 2 (byte invariant)
  byte access	byte 3	byte 2	byte 1	byte 0
  word access	7-0	15-8	23-16	31-24
Depending on this and how your devices are wired up to such a bus, you
may need to swap bytes in a word access, or munge the byte/half word
address itself.
And guess which architecture implements *both* of these...  Grumble.
