Hi
Many apologies if this is off-topic or otherwise inappro.
Several of our networks have Shiva (formerly Spider) terminal servers 
(ShivaPort and ShivaPort ATOM) on them, these provide a method for enabling 
RS232 terminals (wyse 60, wyse 55 mostly) to access the UNIX & Linux servers on 
the networks.... Terminals connect to RS232 ports on the terminal servers, and 
establish a telnet session to a given host...
When the users telnet to a RH 6.0 system (2.2.5 kernel out of the box) the 
screens refresh poorly, i.e. sluggish and pausy, may take 3-5 secs to draw one 
80x25 screen (terminals run at 19200 generally, and are up to it, so little 
more than a second is normal....
Same terminal, same terminal server connecting to a RH 5.2 system (2.0.36 
kernel out of the box) on the same network screen refresh is excellent, as 
indeed it is for various other UNIX servers (HP-UX, UW 2.1.2, Solaris 2.5, etc, 
etc...
Seen the same problem now on at three separate networks, with various different 
revisions of the terminal server firmware, pretty convinced it's a RH 6.0 
related issue...
Note however, that telnet sessions other than from the terminal server are fine 
i.e. from the same terminal via another host, or from PC terminal emulators, 
screen refresh is great....
Things I know it's not :-
	1 Network load... happens with on telnet session to host and nothing else at 
all on the network...
	2 Terminal -> terminal server handshaking, these terminals are all using 
XON/XOFF correctly configured on
	   both the terminal and terminal server, and continue to work unaltered to 
other hosts just fine...
	3. Terminal server version specific
What should I go looking for here? Default packet sizes? Some clues as to 
possible causes more than welcome...
TIA
