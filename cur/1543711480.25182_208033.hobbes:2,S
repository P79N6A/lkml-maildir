why don't you simply interrupt rcu_do_batch after a dozen of callbacks?
if it gets interrupted you then go ahead and you splice the remaining
entries into another list for a tasklet, then the tasklet will be a
reentrant one, so the ksoftirqd will take care of the latency.
the only valid reason to use the timer irq instead of the tasklet in the
first place is to delay the rcu invocation and coalesce the work
together, but if there's too much work to do you must go back to the
tasklet way that has always been scheduler-friendy.
