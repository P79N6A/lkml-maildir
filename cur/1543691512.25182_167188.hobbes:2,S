You're confusing make install with make modules_install. (And
your initial report which spoke of modules_install was obviously
a make install since it ran arch/i386/boot/install.sh)
make modules_install _does_ create and populate the modules directory.
In the top-level Makefile we find:
...
MODLIB	:= $(INSTALL_MOD_PATH)/lib/modules/$(KERNELRELEASE)
...
modules_install: _modinst_ _modinst_post
.PHONY: _modinst_
_modinst_:
	@if [ -z "`$(DEPMOD) -V | grep module-init-tools`" ]; then \
		echo "Warning: you may need to install module-init-tools"; \
		echo "See 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/post-halloween-2.5.txt";
\
		sleep 1; \
	fi
	@rm -rf $(MODLIB)/kernel
	@rm -f $(MODLIB)/build
	@mkdir -p $(MODLIB)/kernel
	@ln -s $(TOPDIR) $(MODLIB)/build
	$(Q)$(MAKE) -rR -f scripts/Makefile.modinst
In particular note the mkdir.
make install does invoke /sbin/installkernel if your
system has one, and that script may expect the /lib/modules/
directory to exist, but that's not a kernel bug.
In any event, make modules_install before make install works
and has always worked for me on RH systems.

depmod does not create any directories, 'make modules_install' does.
