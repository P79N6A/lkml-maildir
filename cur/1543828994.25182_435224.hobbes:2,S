So maybe something like this:
void smp_replace_instruction(void *info) {
        struct ins_replace_args *parms;
        parms = (struct ins_replace_args *) info;
        *parms->addr = *parms->insn
}
void __kprobes arch_arm_kprobe(struct kprobe *p)
{
        struct ins_replace_args parms;
        parms.addr = p->addr;
        parms.insn = BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION
        preempt_disable();
        smp_call_function(smp_replace_instruction, &parms, 0, 1);
        preempt_enable();
}
Thanks
Mike
