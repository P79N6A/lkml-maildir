Sun Microsystems do not advertise their make tool as Makefile
portability validator.  Note the difference: each tool is held to its
own standards.

Please look up the term "proper name" before continuing. BSD make does
not mention "POSIX" a single time in its documentation.

If BSD make is not UNIX make, then what is?
That FreeBSD's /usr/bin/make doesn't like your Makefiles doesn't matter,
GNU and Schily make are available in the ports collection, either is fine.

You still haven't got my point. Last attempt to explain:
smake isn't sufficient to judge if a "Makefile" is portable to all
widespread make programs, particularly does it not warn about non-POSIX
syntax that SUN make or BSD make reject, as shown in my previous message.

Your dislike for GNU make is widely documented, yet only based on
cosmetic bugs. Try if the "remake" guys fix the concerns you have had
about GNU make. remake is a GNU make spinoff with usability
improvements, getting rid of meaningless "Makefile:5: foo.d: No such
file or directory" should be well within reach. Dig through your
sent-mail folder for the explanation you sent me a year or two ago.
See <
http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/remake/>
I'm redirecting answers off-list.
This isn't linux-kernel stuff any more.
BTW, your Message-ID is nonconformant (it doesn't use a qualified domain
name, "burner" isn't appropriate), please fix your mailer.
