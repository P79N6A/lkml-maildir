Hi,
 as stated in the subject, i'm looking for some answers - explanations -
 pointers to the source maybe concerning a mysterious performace loss i
 experienced. 
 first i noticed some weird events, such as waiting several seconds for
 characters typed to be echoed to the screen, extremly long load times
 for normally fast applications like vi, ls etc. and at least repeated
 error messages from fetchmail about timeouts (client server sync 
 failiure).
 my best first bet was that i had hosed a self written programm when i
 thought to improve it, because i'm running it 24 hours a day. but 
 checking it for hidden loops or memory leakage proved negative so i
 started to investigate closer.
 soon there were some common denominaters fixed that occured any time 
 i experianced that performance loss:
 top and/or free showed the amount of memory used for buff seemingly
 at the lowest possible values and stated extreme high idle-times
 80% and more for the cpu, where i was used to see my self written 
 programm drawing 90% and more cpu-capacity.
 next i had a look at the processes shown by top and noticed a steep
 increase of usage by the processes kflushd and/or update. where i was
 used to see accumulated time on them of fractions of seconds during a 
 whole day, now top showed 10 and more seconds runtime after one hour.
 for now (getting the idea after reading the LDP book -tlk the linux
 kernel) i have just found one workaround. whenever i experiance such
 a situation i just start a seemingly senseless tar-command that will
 then allocate more memory to the buff-space and kflushd/update are
 called less frequently. 
 i dont know of others facing this phenomen, but i was able to reproduce 
 it on my computers (a 100 mHz Pentium and a 400 mHz PentiumII) with 
 different kernels 2.0.34, 2.0.36 and 2.2.5.
 hope for some answers
 Helmut
