Hi!
In 2.6.29 (and probably earlier) kernels, booting in docking station
results in undocked s2ram failing.
Problem seems to be that hda (cdrom in dock) is not deregistered
during undock, and that hda driver loops spitting error messages at
'too-fast-to-read' rate when suspend with missing hda is attempted.
