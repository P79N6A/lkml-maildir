Unfortunately all the scenarios I'm aware of where this is an ongoing
issue involve extremely downrev and vendor-centric kernel versions along
with the usual ultraconservative system administration, so this specific
concern is somewhat downplayed as other ongoing functional concerns
(e.g. direct IO on nfs breaking, deadlocks, getting zillions of fs's to
mount at all, etc.) have far higher priority than performance concerns.

Hmm. My first leaning and implementation was to hierarchically LRU
inodes within sb's, but I suppose that's plausible. Let me know if you
want the shrinker callbacks or something else in particular done.
