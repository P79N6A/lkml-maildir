As far as I can tell, when it runs mount -avt, the floppy module
is loaded if there is an entry in /etc/fstab for /dev/fd0 (even w/the noauto
option).

I do not have a modules.devfs.  I do have a /etc/modutils/devfsd, but it does
not have an alias entry for the floppy.
I added the entry, and it now shows up in modules.conf.

I did not have anything specific to /dev/fd* in devfsd.conf, but I did have a
.* entry to load it.  I commented that out, after your other email.
I added /dev/fd0, and /dev/floppy MODLOAD but it is still not autoloading.

Yes, the oops happens during boot when it runs the mountall script, and then
right after when something else tries to access the device.  I did not mention
before, but devfsd will not run after I get this oops.  Or I should say it
dies, and then I can not run it again after logging in.  I get an oops
everytime I access the floppy device after this, but I only get an oops if I
get one during boot.

I had commented out the .* MODLOAD, it worked before that.  I uncommented the
.* and it still does not work, something else must have changed.

OK.  I have nothing but REGISTER PERMISSIONS for floppy in devfsd.conf.

I uncommented .* LOOKUP and it still did not autoload.

OK, done.  I did not get the oops with DEVFS turned off (in 2.4.9).
