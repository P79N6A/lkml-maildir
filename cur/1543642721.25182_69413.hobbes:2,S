You write to some memory that may (perhaps never) be written to
the underlying device, using whatever I/O method that underlying
device uses, including network.
And, if you are going to DMA direct to/from user-space, you have
a real big performance problem when the user changes a single byte
or a small number of bytes in a file. So your (theoretical) next
generation, as you say, "fast" parallel filesystems won't be doing
this.
