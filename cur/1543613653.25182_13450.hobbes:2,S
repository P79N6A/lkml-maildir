Simon: As an (untested) workaround until the bug I describe below is fixed
       it should work for you if select in the Character devices/Joysticks
       submenu the "Game port support" to be compiled statically into the
       kernel instead of compiling it as a module.
The problem is (note that CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT is defined twice with
different values):
<--  snip  -->
...
#
# Joysticks
#
CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT=m
...
#
# Sound
#
...
CONFIG_SOUND_ES1371=y
...
CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT=y
...
<--  snip  -->
It survives even a "make oldconfig".
It's caused by the following in drivers/sound/Config.in:
<--  snip  -->
...
# A cross directory dependence. The sound modules will need gameport.o
compiled in,
# but it resides in the drivers/char/joystick directory. This
define_tristate takes
# care of that. --Vojtech
if [ "$CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT" != "n" ]; then
  if [ "$CONFIG_SOUND_ESSSOLO1" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_SOUND_ES1370" = "y" -o
"$CONFIG_SOUND_ES1371" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_SOUND_SONICVIBES" = "y" ]; then
    define_tristate CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT y
  fi
fi
