You're hitting spot on the idle detection code. Sleep for a second or longer 
and this patch makes you get only your static priority. This way if you 
suddenly become a cpu hog you cant starve the machine. ie. it works with your 
test exactly as I planned it.

Yes I was planning on increasing the child penalty to 95 once the other things 
settled down. This will speed up start time.

The sleep avg decrements at the same place and at the same rate in my patch as 
it does in stock, so I can't see how that's happening.

They're idle. Why do they need higher priority?

It sounds like you're applying your idea of what you expect the priority to be 
based on previous algorithms rather than judging it on it's own merits. I 
didn't see any mention of whether audio skips less or mouse moves smoother 
which is what it's addressing. The data shows it doesn't unfairly 
disadvantage other tasks. CPU hogs get treated as such.
