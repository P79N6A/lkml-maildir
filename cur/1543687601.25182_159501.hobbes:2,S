no, I wrote several data to it, like partitioning it, writing /dev/zero
to it and so on. I moved it from computer to computer to try booting from
it, installed lilo on it and so on. After several hours of messing around
with the device, it failed.
Maybe it is just "forbidden" to partition it, since I know boldly ;)
did mke2fs /dev/sda on the exchanged flashdev and installed lilo on
it too. So far, no problems yet. Still can't boot from it, however 
(is this an USB-HDD in bios or does the bios have to support some
USB-MEMORY-STICK boot-option?)
