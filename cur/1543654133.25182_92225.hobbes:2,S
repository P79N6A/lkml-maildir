Is this the same problem that Intel L440GX Motherboards have. In order to get
it to boot I need to compile a custom kernel with acpi enabled. I am told it
is some kind of irq routing problem and only Intel can fix it with a BIOS update
which they do seem interested in addressing. :-( Sure would be nice to be able
to boot stock Red Hat kernels on this machine.
