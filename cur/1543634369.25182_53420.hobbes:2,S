on my laptop i have a xircom 100 credit kard pcmcia device.
Unfortunately, at 100mbps, the system time goes up to nearly 100% usage.
( the on-board ethernet at 100mbps gets around 25% system usage )
Is there a way to profile the device driver so that i can zero in on the
section of code that may be spinning, doing inefficient things ?
