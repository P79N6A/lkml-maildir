The main hurdle for Tux is that it is not in the mainstream kernel, and
consists of a patch. I think RedHat has precompiled kernels with Tux in
them. The aa kernels also contain tux.
There are also strong indications that 'zero copy tcp/ip' may enable
userspace webservers to achieve comparable bandwidths (many gbits/second).
See for example X15:
