Have you tried cutting power to the machine? (ie physically unplugging it)
Someone has claimed that the chip may not reset otherwise. As it is
Wake-On-Lan capable, that sort of makes sense - it needs to be not
entirely dead.

Are you sure the card is marked rev-A1 and not rev-B1? I was hoping
DFE-530TXs with vt6102 were all rev-B1.
Can you check what's printed on the card and send me the markings on the
main chips?
(one is probably marked DL10030, DL10030A or possibly vt6102 with a big
VIA logo)
