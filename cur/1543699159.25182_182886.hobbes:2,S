Well if (something like) cpu_sibling_map is to become architecture
independant code, it should probably get something like cpu_to_package,
package_to_cpumask sort of things like NUMA has.
I don't know if SMT should become just another level of NUMA because
its not NUMA of course. For the scheduler it seems to make sense because
SMT/SMP/NUMA basically want slight variations of the same thing.
Possibly as you say slab cache could be SMTed, but I'm not convinced
that SMT and NUMA should become inseperable. Anyway I doubt 2.6 will
see a general multi level NUMA framework.

Ahh so yours isn't an earlier/later version of the same implementation..

I've just had hard to trace bug report with it, but there is some
interest in it now so I'll work on sorting it out and getting
something out for testing and review. Sorry for the delay.
