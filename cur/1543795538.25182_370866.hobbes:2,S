Well, the patch was just intended to confirm the problem diagnosis.
The solution Maneesh appears to be advocating to the issue is imposing
del ordering, the issue being that device_del is the call that actually
removes the directories and symlinks, so all callers have to make sure
they've called class_device_del for every class on the device before
calling device_del.  Since this trigger point happens regardless of
references, we can't expect references to get us out of this one, so
we'll have to audit the failing code manually.  I did find and fix one
of these issues in SCSI, but there may be more lurking around ...
