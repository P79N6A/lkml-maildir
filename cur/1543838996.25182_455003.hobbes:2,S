Increasingly so; it solves a lot of reinvent-the-wheel problems, much
like the recent generic time-of-day updates are doing.  And just like
with clocksource updates, not all architectures have converted yet!

Not yet, I think, mostly because RTCs are still being converted to
that framework.
For ACPI PCs, I converted drivers/char/rtc.c to that framework (see:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/427493
) covering most
hardware over the last few years.

It's just a question of _which_ code to build all the time, right?
Having it be standardized core code would seem appropriate.

... except that unless I traced the code wrong, your current patch is
initializing the (wall) clock extremely early ... ergo my comment about
assuming ISA style access.  I'm happy to call that a minor implementation
artifact though, since I haven't noticed any issues with "late" init
for the system wall clock either.

System-On-Chip ... one chip has not just CPU+cache, but also memory controllers
and enough I/O that few external chips are needed.  The one in your cell phone
is probably Linux-capable; the one in your microwave probably isn't.  (For some
sophisticated examples, www.omap.com ... click the left menu then look at the
chips' block diagrams to see what cell phone CPUs look like.)

Not in the big picture, nope.  Which is why I called it an implementation
issue.  I've also noticed the mess of arch/platform specific clock setup
wierdness, and was glad to see you start fixing it.  :)

There's some ARM code to restore the jiffies-vs-rtc clock offset on resume,
which seems like a candidate for wider use.

I think the resume side needs some tweaks, but basically yes.  (The
resume sequencing, like the suspend sequencing, is excessively dumb.
It'd probably be good to resume RTCs before drivers that care about
elapsed time, for example ... )
I'm not entirely sure I see RTC as a clocksource, but maybe that'd
make sense...
