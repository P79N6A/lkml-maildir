Doh, yes :) It just did not trigger.

Right, but please use some constants. I was tripping over the 
       if (direct_gbpages > 0)
somewhere else in the code and it would have been simpler to see
something like:

We have the code in place already and we need to shake out any
remaining problems anyway. So using the CPA code would be preferred as
it adds another user. Can you give it a try please ?
