high session rate HTTP traffic. That means high packet rates, high
session lookup rates, etc...

On SMP, the load is generally divided with user-space on once CPU
and IRQs on the other one, but not well balanced though (less IRQ),
which means that SMP is rarely more than 50-60% faster than UP. On
HT, I normally observe lower performance than on UP.

OK. Amusingly, the HT flag is present on my C2D E8200 :
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8200  @ 2.66GHz
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe nx lm constant_tsc pni monitor ds_cpl vmx smx est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr lahf_lm
