hi all-
it appears that changes in or around invalidate_inode_pages that went into
2.5.32/3 have broken certain cache behaviors that the NFS client depends
on.  when the NFS client calls invalidate_inode_pages to purge directory
data from the page cache, sometimes it works as before, and sometimes it
doesn't, leaving stale pages in the page cache.
i don't know much about the MM, but i can reliably reproduce the problem.  
what more information can i provide?  please copy me, as i'm not a member 
of the linux-kernel mailing list.
