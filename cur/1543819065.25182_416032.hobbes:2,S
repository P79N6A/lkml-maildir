Hmmm... Yes, Ahh! The tree_lock prohibits this sort of thing from 
happening to regular pages. Right.... Yuck this could be expensive to fix.
We are holding the anon_vma lock while remapping migration ptes. So we 
could take the anonvma lock, check to see if the pte is still a migration
pte if so then it cannot change and we can safely increase page 
count.
