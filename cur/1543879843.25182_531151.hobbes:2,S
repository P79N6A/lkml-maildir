They will continue see their previous mount tree. 
Even if all the namespaces belonging to the different sessions of the
user get dismantled when all the sessions exit, the a mirror of those 
mount trees continue to exist under /share/$USER in the original
namespace.  So I don't think we have a issue.
NOTE: when I say 'original namespace' I mean the admin namespace; the
first namespace that gets created when the machine boots.
