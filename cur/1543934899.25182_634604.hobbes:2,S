I added following comment to the changelog:
======
Note: This patchs trigger followings output from checkpatch.pl:
total: 45 errors, 144 warnings, 1097 lines checked
As this is based on a copy of SW from U-boot this is accepted as an
exception.
======
Next time please indicate result of checkpatch.pl run.
Usually I does not accept errors from checkpatch.pl (unless
checkpatch.pl has become utterly confused).
And I added Wolfgang as Cc:
