If two drivers are loaded for the same device, there's no way for udev
to tell the kernel which driver to use for a device, that I know of.
Also, that just sounds very horrible to do. If you have udev/dbus events
flying around for "device present", "device gone", "device present",
then it could make for a very ugly user experience (think of programs to
handle devices being started because of these events).
