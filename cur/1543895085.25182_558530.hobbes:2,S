> What are the issues with arch like ARM ? 
The interesting class ARM belongs to is machines that don't (or don't
always) have hardware support for single-step.  Maintaining the status quo
of how PTRACE_SINGLESTEP functions on these machines is different in
implementation under utrace than it is for machines that always use
hardware support.  That is the only special complication for ARM, and it is
not really very complicated.  Apparently the way I described the issue in
the past was easily misunderstood.

See 
http://redhat.com/~roland/utrace/
 for the patches and a porting howto.
The patches add a Documentation/ file and kerneldoc stuff for the interfaces.
Thanks,
Roland
