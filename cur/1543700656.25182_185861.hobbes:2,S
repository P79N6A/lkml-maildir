> Now, does anyone have a copy of "0.96bp2inc.tar.Z" lying around?
BTW, a few more details on this file - the linux GCC 2.2.2 release was
originally announced 28-Jun-1992.  The 0.96bp2inc.tar.Z file originally
lived on the then-primary linux ftp site banjo.concert.net in directory
pub/Linux/GCC.
banjo stopped being an FTP server a couple months later - however,
Jonathan Magid announced on 13-Aug-1992 that the entire banjo site
was being reincarnated at host reggae.oit.unc.edu in directory
ftp/pub/pc-stuff/Linux.  Here's a copy of the announcement:

My understanding is that reggae.oit morphed at some point into
sunsite.unc.edu (which is now, of course, ibiblio.org)  Jonathan still
appears to be there, so I'm cc:ing him on this (apologies in advance
if its an intrusion, Jonathan) on the off-chance that there might still
be a 1992-era archive of the linux files once hosted by banjo.
The only other person likely to have access to a copy is H J Lu himself
(also cc:'ed although I'm 99% sure he's still on lkml :-)
