So it's brand-spank new motherboard then. It's normal. There was original
old int15 function to detect memory. With 64MiB limitation. Then new
version was added (801). And shortly after that still never version was
developed (820). Quite a few vendors decided that since Windows98 supports
very recent function it's enough to implement only it (first one used by
some versions of DOS's HIMEM so it should be supported anyway).
Unfortunatelly only kernel 2.3 has support for latest function while 2.2
supports first two (while first two will report only amount of available
memory latest one returns complex table with different available memory
regions and so it's not trivial to support it).
