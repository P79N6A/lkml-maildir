To stick with the wheel analogy, while bicycle wheels will
fit on a 40-tonne truck, they won't even get you out of the
parking lot.

You've already admitted that you would need to modify the
existing filesystems in order to create "filesystem independant"
clustered filesystem functionality.
If you're modifying filesystems, surely it no longer is filesystem
independant and you might as well design your filesystem so it can
do clustering in an _efficient_ way.

If you'd only spent 3-4 _days_ looking at clustered filesystems
you would see that it'd take months or years to get something
work decently.

All you can hope for now is that CERN doesn't care about data
integrity or performance ;)
