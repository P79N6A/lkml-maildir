It works badly for kernel patches, stuff does get lost forever, missed
etc. Having it all archived somewhere is really valuable because it
means you can spot patterns, trends and also when someone who isnt a
hacker hits the bug *they* can find the patch you missed and send it on
or remind you
You are assuming there is a relationship in bug severity/commonness and
number of *developers* who hit it. That isnt true, developer and end
user hardware patterns are radically different in some areas
