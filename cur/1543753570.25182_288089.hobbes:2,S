I've done some testing initially. The problem, at least with respect to
CBC, is that the NULL cipher's block size is 1. The CBC path isn't zero
originally and not even in my code (although I planned to do a zero copy
version). 
However, my patch will surely bring some relieve, as my scatterwalk code
does not give up the kmapping after every block, but wait for a page to
be completely processed. So that's one kmap/kunmap instead of 4096.
P.S.: The list of recipients have grown too long and topic moved a bit.
I will remove a bunch of people if I post another follow-up. Please
check the archive if interested and not subscribed.
