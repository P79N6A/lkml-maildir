The UHCI driver never recognizes my hardware.  The OHCI driver (in the
2.4.18 kernel) does however.  My Asus A7M266-D doesn't have an onboard USB
but they ship an add-on card with the motherboard (made by Asus).
I attached the relevant syslogs and kernel logs for a boot-up with the UHCI
driver.  The USB startup is towards the end.
List of USB devices attached:
1) AsusTek USB enhanced Host Controller
2) Logitech USB Camera (QuickCam Web)
3) NEC PCI to USB Open Host Controller
4) NEC PCI to USB Open Host Controller
5) USB Root Hub x2 (Must belong to the USB hub on my monitor, ViewSonic
G773-2)
6) USB Root Hub x2 (Must belong to the USB hub on my monitor, ViewSonic
G773-2)
7) Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical (imPs2)
Thanks!
