Is this flaming really necessary?
So we don't have care about how long some driver spends in it internal
loops? So we could as well start writing drivers like 
	while (!frame_received()) udelay(1000000);
Because one day we will have powershortage anyway and that will anyway cause
few hours latencypeak? And if the user pulls the ethernet plug we don't have
to do anything else?
