Yes ... that I managed to figure out. Seems strange that pgpgin/out are
in units of kilobytes and pswpin/out are in units of pages, though. Just
another little hole that needs plugging in the documentation.

Ah ... so every page to/from swap is counted in pswpin/out (as a page)
and again in pgpgin/out as half-kilobytes :-). Incidentally, I also
followed the third fork in this road, the one which derives the "blocks"
read and written per device that show up in /proc/stat. Those "blocks"
turn out to be 512 bytes long.
All of this is quite useful, actually, because I'm trying to make sense
of some high-frequency (every 15 seconds) samples of I/O data. Thanks!!
