If I wrote int j, J; in my code, you'd have valid case wanting me to
fix it. And I simply want you to fix useless uses of utf-8. And evil
uses utf8, like int voltage; /* ??V */. I do not know what is so hard
to understand.
You are intentionally making code hard to read. Stop trying to merge
that crap.
