Subject: aacraid success with 2.4.17-pre8. Intentional?

I've been trying to set up an HP NetRaid 4M controller, (aacraid), and I got
the familiar fsck hang with both the latest drivers provided by Matt Domsch,
and Alan Cox, under kernel 2.4.16.
I've just tried the latest 2.4.17-pre8 kernel, and it works, in that
it gets passed the fsck'ing. I couldn't see anything in the changelog that
screamed "Fix fsck hang with aacraid", so I was wondering if my working
setup is intentional or not? I haven't followed the development of this
driver too closely, I just had the card and downloaded the latest "stable"
release and went from there...
Searching the archives, I couldn't see anyone reporting a success with this
kernel and card combination, which worried me slightly. Have I got something
that will fall over if I sneeze near it? :-)
Cheers
Matt
