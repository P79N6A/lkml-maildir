Sounds right to me. If you relocate the LBA sector then on retry I will
(a) read {something} without error, and (b) it will NOT be my data, and
(c) I will not get back an error to tell me I am reading crap. In other
words, to do anything else would result in my silently getting back bad
data!
What should be done is to relocate after successful retry or after
unsuccessful write, because in both cases the drive has valid data to
relocate.
Blockbusting news, I think they're doing it just right. The object is
not to do a read and get no error, the object is to read and get correct
data, and if that doesn't happen, let the controller, o/s, or
application know about it decide what to do then.
