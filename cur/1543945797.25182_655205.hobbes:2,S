Yes Sam, I've read Peter and Ingo comments on this patch
(actually I sent the same patch maybe week ago and Peter
and Ingo told me that we use %fs,%gs now for stack) but
as I pointed in comment - this alignment is still using
by Xen and lguest and even x86. So - it would be really
usefull for me if someone give me the last point - YES we
use such an alignment for stack, NO - we don't use it at all.
I was trying to hadle this myself - but I'm not a specialist
in this area you know ;)
