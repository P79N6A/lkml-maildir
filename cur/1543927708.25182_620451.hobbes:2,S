Hi Andi,
    This is an interesting idea, thanks for the code!  My only question is 
whether we can get most of this benefit by dropping the indirection of 
namespaces and have something like "EXPORT_SYMBOL_TO(sym, modname)"?  It
doesn't work so well for exporting to a group of modules, but that seems
a reasonable line to draw anyway.
Cheers,
Rusty.
PS.  Probably better to use the standard warnx and errx in modpost, too.
