I'm afraid 2.4-hf does not go that far backwards, it started at 2.4.29.
Git started even later. I've searched through 
http://linux.bkbits.net/
and I think that what you're looking for is here :

You don't have to worry, unless explicitly stated otherwise, patches
follow the same licence as the code they're for. So basically you can
apply a kernel patch from any other version to your kernel, and if you
know how to fix the bug by yourself (dangerous), that's fine too.
