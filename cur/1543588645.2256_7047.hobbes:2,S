Hey guys,
Im trying to get the 2.4.3 Kernel on a Dell dimension 8100 (p4, 1.3ghz).  
The 2.2* kernels work fine but when I start up with the new kernel it 
dies at the line "cpu:0, clocks:0, slice:0".  It also says something about 
"wierd, boot kernel (CPU#0) not found in BIOS. "  There is also a message 
that said Host Bus speed is 0.00mhz.  It gets the processor speed right 
though.  I chose the P4 family in the kernel compilation. I also tried 
the P3 family.
Sorry for the lack of detailed info, didn't leave a log (that I could 
find).  Thanks
Mike
