I think it does. Allocating all possible in future allocated pages
is just not possible for VM_GROWSDOWN, because the stack has really 
no suitable limit (other than rlimits, which are far too big to
mlock them) 
BTW expand_stack seems to have a small bug: it adds to mm->locked_vm
the complete offset from last vm_start; if it covers more than one page
the locked_vm value will be too large.

For the stack they can get minor faults anyways when they allocate new
stack space below ESP. There is no good way to fix that from the kernel; the 
application has to preallocate its memory on stack. I think it's reasonable
if it does the same for holes on the stack.
