AFAIK, both. Coppermine is the code name of the low level arch of
the chip.
Really, the kernel should be querying the builder: Have you a
Deschutes, a Mendocino or a Coppermine ? How much cache do you have ?
But that is rarely known (Uh? I bought a Pentium III). You have to 
guess from the answer to:
Have you a PII, an old Celeron (Mendocino) or a new Cel-PIII (Copper).
