My kdev_t is a pointer to a structure with device data
and device operations. Among the operations a routine
that produces a name. Among the data, in the case of a
block device, the size, and the sectorsize, ..
A minor gives no name, and no data.
Linus' minor is 20-bit if I recall correctly.
My minor is 32-bit. Neither of the two can be
used to index arrays.
