Someone needs to take a look at the MODULE_LICENSE string reported by
the HSF modem drivers made by LinuxAnt.
http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/hsf/full/downloads.php
They creatively inserted a \0 character in it.
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL\0for files in the \"GPL\" directory; for others,
only LICENSE file applies");
Runnning modinfo -F license on the compiled driver gives:
GPL because of their creative null character. The actual license for most of
the files is NOT GPL.
