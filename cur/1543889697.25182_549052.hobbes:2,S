I did not rewrite any part of your code except replacing COPY4() macro
and some open-coded byte-by-byte copying with memcpy(). But this has
resulted in very significant perf. loss (as suggested by results from
Richard's tests) - so will rollback these changes.
Additionally following was done to _greatly_ reduce no. of LOC I had
to retain. These should not affect code correctness and performance:
- Used standard/kernel defined data types equivalent of lzo_* types.
This resulted in removal of huge chunks of #ifdefs:
    lzo_byptep -> unsigned char *
    lzo_uint -> size_t
    lzo_xint -> size_t
    lzo_uintptr_t -> unsigned long
    lzo_uint32p -> uint32_t *
- Removed everything #ifdefed under COPY_DICT  -- from minilzo code I
see that this is not #defined for LZO1X (safe/unsafe) (though I could
not understand meaning behind COPY_DICT).
- Removed everthing #ifdef'ed for LZO1Y, LZO1Z, other variants.
Thanks,
Nitin
