No, although there is a spin_trylock_bh for whatever reason.
Implementing this would not be hard, you just need to disable irqs
_before_ spin_trylock to avoid a race.  Something like:
	int dog;
	unsigned long flags;
	local_irq_save(flags);
	dog = spin_trylock(lock);
	if (!dog)
		local_irq_restore(flags);
Oh, I'll just attach a patch.  Enjoy,
