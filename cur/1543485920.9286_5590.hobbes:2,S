Are you actually still talking about a small fixed-sized array here (which
sounds cumbersome) or a linked list (which is slightly more challenging
to binary search efficiently). The problem does immediately suggest a tree
approach though. In fact there might be several places in the VFS where we
build and sort lists (elevator algorithm?) that might be more efficiently
done with trees.
