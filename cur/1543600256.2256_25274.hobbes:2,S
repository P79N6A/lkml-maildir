Okay, make the definition
"this kernel will not attempt to change anything on that filesystem".
This does not neccesarily mean -oro should have this semantics, maybe we
need something like -orealro, but we should have some mode when writing on
that disk is taboo. [I need that for suspend-to-disk support: I need to 
write suspend data do disk, while I need noone to touch those disks,
because I already took snapshot.]
