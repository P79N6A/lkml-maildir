I really really think this should be backed out -- or at the very least
disabled. The code wasn't part of the dhiggen merge, it wasn't tested,
and it doesn't work well. Heck, it's still experimental and not recommended
in 2.4.0-test.
What's worse, it will burn everybody out there who is using am-utils or 
an automounter that tries TCP mounts first. NFS/UDP server support in 2.2.18
is so much better than in previous versions, it would a shame to ruin
it with this ill-fated patch.
