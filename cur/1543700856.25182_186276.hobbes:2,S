Hi Vojtech,
I suspect this problem has something to do with my nForce2 motherboard.
When I mount a CD, unmount it, and try to eject it from my drive, the
drive flashes the red 'busy / locked' light and refuses to let me eject
it. I'm using the AMD / nVidia IDE kernel support and the obvious
conclusion is that it's failing to release the device or something. Is
this true?
I suspect the fix would be a one liner.
