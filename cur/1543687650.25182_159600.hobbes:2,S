   One thing I like to ask is that you removed the if EMBEDDED | !X86 from 
VGA_CONSOLE. To my knowledge no one had problems with enabling vga console 
before the EMBEDDED changes. The reason I ask is because as it stands the 
configuration is forcing everyone on intel to enable the vga console. Even 
when you want to just run framebuffer console. Most newbie users will not 
know that they have to go back and enable "Embedded" support on a desktop 
machine just to disable vgacon. 
   This is important because on the intel platform people are moving to 
framebuffer console. Also it would not shock me to see in one or two 
generations graphics card not supporting VGA cores anymore. For example I 
have several newer graphics cards for intel with DVI ports instead of VGA.
Once the market is flooded with DVI monitors and graphics cards there is no
need for VGA core support anymore.
