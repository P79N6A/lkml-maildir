Have you done any benchmarking? micro-benchmarking?

FWIW, unlikely part makes no difference whatsoever with my usual config
and gcc-3.4.6. Messing with error codes makes .o slightly bigger:
text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
4483       0       0    4483    1183 fs/select.o
4490       0       0    4490    118a fs/select.o
