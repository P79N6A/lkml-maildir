 for a nice list of addresses to send

the original email came from 216.27.3.45.
a quick grep thru past archives of this mailing list is a relatively 
trivial way to find out who it is . . .
the person has been foolish enough to post to this list from that 
ip-address before.
i won't post details of that, but it is a relatively trivial exercise to go 
thru . . .
perhaps we can all get on with real work now . . . :-)
cheers,
lincoln.
