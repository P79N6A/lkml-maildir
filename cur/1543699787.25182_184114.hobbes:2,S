Using update and BK/Web means manually reconciling two sets of data
which may have different time bases.  If update has not been run for 23
days, the user has to look at "Changesets in the last four weeks" and
manually determine where in that log of 119 changesets (linux-2.5)
their last update was done before they know which changesets are in the
current update.
What about this, assuming it does not give away information that you
believe will be used for $SCM.  Treat the BK changelog as a file, and
have update generate a patch from the last update for the changelog as
well as the project files.
