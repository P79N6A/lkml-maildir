He just ported the x86-64 change over without any original authorship
attribution :/
And some less functionality (only works for ACPI now) and some totally
unrelated Documentation cleanup and a few random printk changes.
The ACPI only thing is probably mostly ok because the timing won't work
at least on the dual cores without ACPI anyways because PMtimer is needed.
On single cores it would be useful even without ACPI
(for that earlyquirk.c just would need to be moved up to run independently
of ACPI) 
Still it's probably a good idea for 2.6.16.
