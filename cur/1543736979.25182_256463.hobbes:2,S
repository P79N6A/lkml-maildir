Now I (maybe) properly understand what you mean :-). But I still have one
concern about your idea.
For architectures which have a functional acpi_unregister_gsi, we need to
declare "extern void acpi_unregister_gsi(int gsi);" in include/linux/acpi.h
that is common to all architectures. I think include/linux/acpi.h is the
best place to declare it because acpi_register_gsi(), opposite portion of
acpi_unregister_gsi(), is declared in it. On the other hand, for archtectures
that have no-op acpi_unregister_gsi(), acpi_unregister_gsi() is defined as
static inline function in arch specific header files. This looks not natural
to me.
How do you think?
Thanks,
