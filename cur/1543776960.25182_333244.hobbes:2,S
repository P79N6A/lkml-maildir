UI support belongs here for the following reasons:
- While driver support is imperfect, there is the potential for hangs.
People need to be able to recognise when this happens. They therefore
need some feedback to know that the process is not hung, and to be able
to say where it hung when it does.
- Particularly for the desktop, we want the system to look professional,
not half baked.
- Some support is needed for the user to be able to cancel a suspend.
You might not want to. Others might not want to, but this doesn't mean
that others shouldn't have the option of changing their minds.
I have already moved much of the code out to userspace in an effort to
ease your concerns. I'm not going so far as to remove the functionality,
though.
Regards,
Nigel
