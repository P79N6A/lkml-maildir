Thinking about it some more, how would file managers and
file chosers handle this situation ?
Currently the user browses the directory tree and when
the user clicks on something, one of the following 
happens:
1) if it is a directory, the file manager/choser changes
   into that directory
2) if it is a file, the file is opened
Now how do we present things to users ?
How will users know when an object can only be chdired
into, or only be opened ?
For objects that do both, how does the user choose ?
Do we really want to have a file paradigm that's different
from the other OSes out there ?
What happens when users want to transfer data from Linux
to another system ?
