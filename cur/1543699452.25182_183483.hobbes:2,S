Looks like this patch fixed the problem. Since I applied this patch two
days ago, the computer hasn't crashed (yesterday or today).

I can't get this link to work... but I don't then need it.
Some more facts which clearly point into ipchains problem:
This computer has two network cards, another connected to the Internet,
another to a laptop. The ipchains is used to allow the laptop to access
Internet. The laptop generally doesn't do that, except at 13:00 when a cron
job runs ntpdate, and now that I think it, the crash happened probably
every day soon after 13:00 (but not exactly, I believe).
Thanks.
