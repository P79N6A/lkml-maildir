After fiddling with this patch for so long, I forgot to mention an 
important thing:
This time the patch only includes things that need no fixups at all (most 
of these already went in last time).
So all hunks are independent, and you can just drop anything that does not 
apply or causes any other trouble. 
Thanks,
Tim
