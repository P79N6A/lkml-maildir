I totally agree that in 99.9% of cases, Set 2 is a more sensible
choice than Set 3.
On the other hand, a configuration option to only support Set 3, and
not implement all of the work-arounds would shrink the kernel by a few
K, which would be nice.
Also, the keyboard I'm using requires Set 3 to operate fully, although
as it's quite possible that I am the only person on the planet who
uses this model of keyboard with Linux, that might not be a very valid
argument :-).
John.
