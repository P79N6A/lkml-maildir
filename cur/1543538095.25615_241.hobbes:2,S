Digital UNIX (now Tru64, was OSF/1) uses self-modifying code to
create a generic kernel that can do, if I remember right:
1. plain
2. real-time
3. SMP
4. real-time SMP
5. lock debugging
So, if you don't want these features, you only suffer some NOPs and
perhaps sub-optimal register allocation. I suppose the x86 version
of this could be a debug breakpoint byte followed by a byte to indicate
the required operation -- lock, unlock, or whatever. One might also
be able to make the assembler spit out addresses, like the exception
table code does.
Other uses for this technique include: Generic kernels could run
on a real i386 without being slow on a 486. Modules could work for
SMP, huge memory, and normal kernels. Exact process accounting could
be part of every kernel, but NOPed out at runtime if not enabled.
Perhaps even RT-Linux could use this ability.
