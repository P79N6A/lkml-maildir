it's not clear i think from your description how the kmalloc()-ed GFP_DMA
buffer gets passed to the chip, exactly. [one small nitpick: to be
platform-independent, you should use virt_to_bus(vaddr)].
is kmalloc() returning a pointer that points to a <16MB page? Adding a few
printks to the driver could help ...
