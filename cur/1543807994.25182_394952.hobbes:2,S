That's precisely the problem, it may be really simple to fix but often
will stop people from testing.
Your fix count probably isn't totally accurate either, I bet a lot of
these are fixups due to conflicts with other patches. I'm talking about
the fact that someone sends Linus a patch which doesn't compile for the
case you could (and should) have trivially checked. A little edumacation
never hurt :-)
