Indeed.
I am even happy in a somewhat more general situation that you are.
If the kernel autopartitions (and make recognition of new partitions
hotplug events so that udev can create the device nodes), all is well.
On the other hand, if the kernel does not autopartition
(for example because I had not selected CONFIG_MAC_PARTITION
and put a Mac disk in my ZIP drive) then all is still well
since user space can tell the kernel about the partitions
it sees on this Mac disk. Of course these partitions that
userspace tells the kernel about must also lead to hotplug
events.
