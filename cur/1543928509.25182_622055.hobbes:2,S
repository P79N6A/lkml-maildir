Not forever, but it's been there for a while - it was introduced here:
commit 2adcec2197897365e0a0f657f1098cbfdb44bc8b

    uml: send pointers instead of structures to I/O thread
    Instead of writing entire structures between UML and the I/O thread, we send
    pointers.  This cuts down on the amount of data being copied and possibly
    allows more requests to be pending between the two.
    This requires that the requests be kmalloced and freed instead of living on
    the stack.
