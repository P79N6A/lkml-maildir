In doing lots of kernel build testing, I often want to enable all options
in a sub-menu and their sub-sub-menus.  Sound is one of the worst^W longest
of these, so I chose a shorter (easier) one to practice on:  parport.
For PARPORT, this isn't terribly needed; it's just being a guinea pig
for me.  The point is to be able to enable all applicable options at
one time (one line or one click).
So if no (top-level of a CONFIG, like CONFIG_PARPORT) options are enabled,
you can step thru the entire menu and sub-menus, taking a few minutes
sometimes (see SOUND or USB), or the kconfig system could enable some
way to do this for us.  For version 1, all that I have done is modify
driver/parport/Kconfig -- no code changes.  I haven't even looked at the
source code to see if that would be the right thing to do.  I'm just
taken liberties with the famous Kconfig "select" to make it work.
I can already see that I find this useful, but is there a good (better)
way to implement this in kconfig?
As it is here, PARPORT_ENABLE_ALL tracks PARPORT (y/m/n) when the former
is enabled/configured.  The downside of this Kconfig usage is that almost
all lines of "depends" are duplicated as "select" (and that it uses "select").
It would be good if there was some way to automate this.
Comments?
