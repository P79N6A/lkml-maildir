I've had a few spontaneous restarts (which actually might have been
shutdowns, any key press will make the machine up so a power down when
working would probably look like a restart).
I've assumed these were heat related, mostly because they also
occurred when the CPU was working hard and the weather has been pretty
warm lately.
