your kernel utilizes the kernelin a more optimal way: the new 
clockevents code now utilizes the local APIC timer irq (represented by 
the LOC field) for periodic interrupts. The local APIC timer irq has a 
cost of ~2 usecs per IRQ, while the PIT irq is ~10 usecs per irq. With 
HZ=1000 this means savings of ~8000 usecs per second - i.e. 8 msecs per 
second, which is 0.8% more raw CPU power available - which isnt that 
bad.
we could make this clearer by renaming 'LOC' (which stands for 'LOCal 
timer interupts' and was added [and misnamed] by yours truly many moons 
ago) to 'apic-timer' and 'timer' to 'PIT-timer' but /that/ would be more 
of a userspace visible change than the change in the counter rates.
