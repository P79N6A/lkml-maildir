I regularly do ftp transfers both ways, and I normally see around 3.7k
per second download, and around 3.4k per second upload, which puts my
upload bandwidth at around 90% of my download bandwidth...
I've just checked, I uploaded a 730k bzip2 archive last night, and
achieved 3.37k/s as the average speed over the transfer according to
the log I keep. How does that sound?
For reference, Redhat 6.0 upgraded to 2.2.10 raw, all official RedHat
update rpm's applied...
Best wishes from Riley.
