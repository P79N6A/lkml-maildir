 one can find 
patches for things that don't compile (they remove workarounds for bugs in 
original headers that break compilation when headers aren't broken :). I hope 
to push them to application maintainers.
Changes:
- The name changed. Old name (glibc-kernel-headers) was not adequate. These 
headers can be used with eg. uClibc without any problems.
- define __bswap_constant* if missing in glibc
- HZ definition on i386 is again a constant 
- framebuffer fixes for sparc
- some other fixes
