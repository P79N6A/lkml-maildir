   please don't flame me - just a question: how long will it take
   until all the other vger lists (smp, fsdevel etc.) will operate
   again - i think it should be doable to setup a few majordomo lists
   within a week - so what is the problem here?
They should be up by the end of tomorrow evening (PST timezone).
I wanted to defer that work until linux-kernel's final config final
settled down (so I wouldn't have to make the same damn change for
every single list, multiple times :-).
Later,
