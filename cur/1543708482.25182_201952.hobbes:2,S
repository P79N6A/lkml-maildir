Yes, I'll try to figure out where this request came from, if from
anyone at Dell.  My guess is it's related to other operating systems,
over which I have no control, but isn't relevant to Linux.
In general, I tend to fight exactly the opposite - people wanting
drivers split out for "new technology" - say, PCI Express, when the
driver<->firmware API hasn't changed, which is just wrong again.
If it's got a different driver<->firmware API, then it needs a new
driver.  If it's the same API, then it should be the same driver.
FWIW, I'm out of the office for the next couple weeks with a new baby,
thus limited sleep and access to people, but I'll discover what I
can, and will take the heat internally for saying "split the driver"
if in fact you've got two different APIs, as I suspect you do.
Thanks,
Matt
