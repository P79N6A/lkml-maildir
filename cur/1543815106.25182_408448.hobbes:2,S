It does not fix the general problem that alloc_pages_node must not respect 
cpusets. Slab, device drivers etc etc are still screwed up with this 
patch. 
We noticed this first in page migration but I think the other areas are 
much more problematic.
The earlier patch is correct. What Andrew wanted is an optimization 
not a general change in the patch. And
#ifdef CPUSETS
#endif
around the ORing of __GFP_NOCPUSET may suffice.
Maybe you got a better idea?
