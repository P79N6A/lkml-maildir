The answer to what timer is getting used appears to be:
   time.c: Using 3.579545 MHz PM timer.
   time.c: Detected 2612.615 MHz processor.
   time.c: Using HPET/TSC based timekeeping.
I'm still waiting for the compile to complete to test
Mr. Morton's workaround. Should have results posted
in about 15 minutes.
Thanks,
