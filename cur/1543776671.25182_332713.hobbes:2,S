Which seems to support the notion that namesys stopped support for reiser3
when reiser4 was started. The tracking of who submittend and who committed
patches wasn't there just over a year ago so sometimes it's hard to tell 
who actually posted that patch if someone like Andrew or Linus committed it. 
But in most of the changesets on the bkbits site you can go back over 2 years 
and not see anything from namesys people. Nearly all of the fixes commited
in the past 2-3 years are from SuSe.
