How do I make the kernel to wait about 10s before attempting to mount
root filesystem?  Is there obscure kernel parameter?
I can load the kernel from /dev/fd0, then mount /dev/hda2 as root
filesystem.  But, I can't seem to mount /dev/sda1 (USB key drive) as
root filesystem.  All relevant USB and SCSI modules are compiled into
the kernel.  I think kernel is too fast in panicking.  I would like the
kernel to wait about 10s until 'usb-storage' and 'sd_mod' work out all
the details.
