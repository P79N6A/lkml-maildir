Don't do that.  That is only good if the filesystem thinks that there
is no journal, or it is using a hidden inode for the journal (i.e. if
you run "tune2fs -l /dev/whatever" and it doesn't have "has_journal"
listed in the filesystem features (this is what happened with 2.4.10).
Otherwise, you will delete your real journal, tune2fs will complain,
and then you will need to run e2fsck to clean up after yourself, before
re-creating your journal again.
If you have a filesystem with a .journal file, and you want to "hide"
it, just run e2fsck 1.25 while the filesystem is unmounted, and it
will do it for you.  If you don't want to have a .journal in the first
place, run tune2fs -j while the filesystem is unmounted.
Cheers, Andreas
