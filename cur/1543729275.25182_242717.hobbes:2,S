I was trying to use CIFS, but it failed to mount my samba shares whereas 
mounting a share of a Win2K PC worked.
I dowloaded and compiled the newest samba-server, but that didn't help 
either so I investigated a bit.
After googling if someone else was experiencing this problem I became a 
bit iritated because I only found a handful results, none helped to 
solve this problem in any way.
So I narrowed the problem down myself.
In fs/cifs/cifssmb.c around line 238 the cifs modul expects a 16 Byte 
GUID, where samba only send 14 bytes consisting of some random numbers 
followed by my workgroupname: WG.
So I to set my workgroupname to something longer with enabled me to 
mount my share.
I am not sure what the right behaviour is (must cifs accept shorter 
seqenzes or must samba send some dummy bytes to fill up to 16 Bytes), 
but I think it should be possible to mount shares in workgroups which 
names are shorter the 4 Bytes.
Help would be appreciated
