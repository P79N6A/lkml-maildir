It seems like the following does it:
- run for a while
- suspend
- wake..run for a while
- maybe suspend and wake a few more times?
- cause a heavish burst of net traffic
If it would matter I'm running wep.  It may happen more often when I've
got an ipsec tunnel running over the connection as well (tunnel never
left open during suspend nor ipsec module left loaded).  When it's
happened cpu utilisation was pretty low.
