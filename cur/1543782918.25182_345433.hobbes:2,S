Hello,
During the Kernel Summit somebody raised the point that it's not clear
how much testing each rc/pre/git kernel gets before the final release.
So I setup a server to track automatically the amount of testing that
each kernel gets. Clearly this will be a very rough approximation and it
can't be reliable, but perhaps it'll be useful. If this won't be useful,
the time I spent on it is very minor so no problem ;).
All the details can be found in the project website:
	
http://klive.cpushare.com/
Full source (server included) is here:
	
http://klive.cpushare.com/downloads/klive-0.0.tar.bz2
To run the client:
	wget 
http://klive.cpushare.com/klive.tac
Then at every boot (like in /etc/init.d/boot.local):
	twistd -oy klive.tac
In theory we could get rid of the client entirely and make it a kernel
config option, but I've no idea if this project is useful, so I don't
want to spend too much time on it at this point.
Thank you.
