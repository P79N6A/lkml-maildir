   That change is right - but only if devfs is included. If devfs is not
   present the old names should be reported by /proc/devices IMHO
I was tempted to do this for the serial driver, but was concerned people
(especially Linus) might not accept the extra #ifdef's.  I'd be happy to
fix this for all of the tty devices if folks think it's a good idea.
