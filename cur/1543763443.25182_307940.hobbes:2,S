The work may be already assigned to that callback device, 
new work cant, barriers are there to ensure that
reference counters are updated in proper places, but not 
before.
It would be a bug to update dev->refcnt before assigned work is finished
and callback removed.

cn_queue_wrapper() atomically increments cbq->cb->refcnt if runs, so it
will
be caught in 
while (atomic_read(&cbq->cb->refcnt)) 
  msleep(1000);
in cn_queue_free_callback().
If it does not run, then all will be ok.
Btw, it looks like comments for del_timer_sync() and cancel_delayed_work
()
are controversial - del_timer_sync() says that pending timer
can not run on different CPU after returning, 
but cancel_delayed_work() says, that work to be cancelled still 
can run after returning.
