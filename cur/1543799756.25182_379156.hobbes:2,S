Or after some period of time the code causing the regression gets rolled 
back and the patch gets delayed until the regression is fixed or at 
least understood. Other than a fix for an exploitable security issue 
there are few things added in any mailline release which couldn't wail 
until the next mainline or -stable comes out.
Historically patches have been rejected because they were "not the right 
way to fix the problem," even though they did work (some of mine during 
early SMP days, for example). I would hope that introducing a regression 
also qualifies as "not the right way to fix the problem," and 
particularly not the right way to introduce some new feature or 
performance enhancement.
I suspect that the developer of a patch would be more likely to work on 
the regression if it were preventing the fix from going in.

Good luck. Someone qualified to do that job would also be qualified to 
do more interesting things...
