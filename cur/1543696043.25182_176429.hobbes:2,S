Consider using debian then - a glibc upgrade there
is no problem as various services (including init)
are restarted automatically mostly without disturbing
running applications.
To make everything use the new library revision,
do an "init 1".  You'll get to single-user mode where
you either log in and do an "init 2" or simply
press ctrl+D for the same effect.
After that, nothing is holding onto deleted old libraries
and /usr may be remounted read-only if you like.
