Actually I was not quite correct.  The call to timeout WILL return
immediately, however, the timeout code will clean up the timer, so there
should be no worry there.  It is a bug in that the sleep does not happen
as expected.  I saw at least one place where there were comments about
it not working.. and he did not set the state.  For what its worth I
think the schedule_timeout() should be changed to __schedule_timeout()
and two new time out calls be used {un}interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(),
these calls to do the set up of state.  In fact the interruptible
version already exists.  Of course things like select would have to use
__schedule_timeout() as they are waiting for any of several events.
