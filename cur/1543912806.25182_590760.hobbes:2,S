Err...
I don't understand why you need a lawyer to interpret this document:
/*     $OpenBSD: ar5210.c,v 1.39 2007/04/10 17:47:55 miod Exp $        */

If you want to add more code to it, and your contribution is
significant, simply add you name next to Reyk's. Where's the problem?
I don't know how licensing could be any simpler than this. Please,
notice, that there are no additional documents (other than the
copyright law) to read here -- _this is the complete licence_! (And
you have to read the copyright law even if you use the GNU GPL.)
