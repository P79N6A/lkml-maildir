Do these bitfields have locking?
On some architectures, it might be that
	foo->mounted = 1;
will race with another CPU doing
	bar->connected = 1;
if the CPU+compiler implements bitfield modification via non-atomic
read/modify/write.
I don't know whether that's happening in real life, but it's a subtle risk.
