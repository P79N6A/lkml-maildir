        Because then you don't have to have a branch for
case where the platform *does* support consistent memory.

        Then you're not fully weighing the benefits of this facility.
The primary beneficiaries of this facility are device drivers for
which we'd like to have the performance advantages of consistent
memory when available (at least on machines that always return
consistent memory) but which we'd also like to have work as
efficiently as possible on platforms that lack consistent memory or
have so little that we want the device driver to still work even when
no consistent memory is available.  That includes all PCI devices that
users of the inconsistent parisc machines want to use.
