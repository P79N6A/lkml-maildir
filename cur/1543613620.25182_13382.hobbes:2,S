hi-
with the above combination, i'm experiencing some strange behavior.  i
have the following layout:
root@mail:/home/djk > df -T
Filesystem    Type   1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda5     ext2     7566400     77008   7105040   2% /
/dev/sda1     ext2       54416      5750     45857  12% /boot
/dev/sdb6 reiserfs     8329408    200324   8129084   3% /opt
/dev/sdb5 reiserfs     9437828   1162232   8275596  13% /usr
/dev/sda7 reiserfs     9253120    112272   9140848   2% /var
shmfs          shm      127552         0    127552   0% /dev/shm
everything you see is mounted at boot, with the 3 resiserfs partitions
being mounted with a standard suse 7.2 boot (/etc/init.d/boot):
mount -av -t nonfs,noproc,nodevpts
they system comes up ok, but i'm unable to unmount any of the reiserfs
partitions:
root@mail:/home/djk > umount -f /opt
umount2: Device or resource busy
umount: /opt: device is busy
what's weird is that it looks like the kernel is stuck on the mount of the
partition:
root@mail:/home/djk > fuser -v /opt
                     USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
/opt                 root     kernel mount  /opt
same thing for the other two reiserfs partitions.
if i remove any of the resier partitions from /etc/fstab, i'm able to
mount them and umount them without a problem once the system is up.
so, on first glance, there appears to be some type of weird interaction
between the new aacraid code and reiser.
thanks-
dan
