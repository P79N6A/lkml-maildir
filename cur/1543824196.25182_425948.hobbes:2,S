The question I'm stuck with is: When is it valid to ask for a non-shared
IRQ, and get back a shared one. 
Drivers that know that they don't work well if they are called by the
"other" interrupt?
I happen to know (ISA) hardware that CANNOT share an interrupt: It
drives the IRQ line either high or low, and has a driver that will
overpower anything else on that line. This sounds like a good place to
me to have the driver request no sharing (*), and to prevent the IRQ
line drivers getting in eachothers way, it would be nice if the kernel
refused "early on" (i.e. before the stronger driver asserts: No IRQ
pending, and the weaker one keeps trying to assert: "YES, I have an
IRQ", and the weaker one slowly burning out).
Or am I talking nonsense again?
	Roger. 
(*) The driver knows to allow sharing when it's talking to the PCI
version of the card.
