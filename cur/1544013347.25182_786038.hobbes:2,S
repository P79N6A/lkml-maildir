Oops, I notice that I skipped over this comment.
It is a good example of needed cleanup.
(I proposed moving this to kernel/acpi/acpica/, not 
kernel/acpi/utilities/)
But the Linux kernel doesn't compile the contents of utcache.c
and indeed, I should delete that entire file from the tree.
Linux compiles this in osl.c instead:
acpi_status acpi_os_release_object(acpi_cache_t * cache, void *object)
{               
        kmem_cache_free(cache, object);
        return (AE_OK);
}
thanks for pointing this out, I'll deal with it right now.
