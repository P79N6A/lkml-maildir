I hope this isn't a general rule?  I can't keep up with the list, but I saw
this message, and it looks like a disaster.
There are a lot of small-size desktop machines that depend on USB keyboards
because they don't have PS/2 ports.  In some cases the keyboard includes a
PS/2 hub for a PS/2 mouse, but in some cases the keyboard doesn't even have
that so the mouse is also USB.  In all of these cases the connection to the
CPU goes through a USB port.
How should the user restore their keyboard after resuming from suspend?  A
modprobe or insmod command?  In the vast majority of these cases the input
of a command would depend on having the USB keyboard already working.
