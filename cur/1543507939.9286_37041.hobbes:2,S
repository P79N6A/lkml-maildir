No, I haven't.  A "module" can be static or dynamic; Linus agrees with
me:  Look at include/linux/init.h:  I can use module_init() and
module_exit() regardless of whether the module is built into the kernel
or not.  My feature is the same:  you can use /proc/module/...
regardless of whether your module is a built-in module.

You're not making sense.  This has nothing to do with anything listed in
/proc/modules or the top-level proc code.
Even if you cleaned up the proc code, module authors would still have no
standard place to put extra, driver-specific /proc entries.  My patch
adds that.
