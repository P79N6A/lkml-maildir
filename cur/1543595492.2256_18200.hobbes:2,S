Hi All,
I have discovered that while running 2.4.6pre5, the kernel does not see all
available RAM - I have 1GB and the kernel only sees ~899MB.  The stock
Redhat 7.1 kernel sees the full 1024MB.  Adding mem=1024M on boot does not
help either.
I'm running an IBM x340, dual 1GHz cpu.
Have I missed something?
Stuart
