Yes, an OpenFirmware emulator would be interesting. It would allow to
softboot OF PCI cards on non-OF machines, and would allow to implement
properly resume from sleep on some desktop G4s that will power off the
PCI bus during sleep (some cards need to be re-softbooted, like video 
ones, and in some case, you really want the vendor firmware to run).
