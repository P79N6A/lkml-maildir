this is a pre kernel, it's meant to *test* stuff, if anything will go
wrong we're here ready to fix it immediatly. Sure, applying the patch of
the last minute to an -rc just before releasing the new official kernel
w/o any kind of testing was a bad idea, but we must not be too much
conservative either, especially like in these cases where we are fixing
bugs, I mean we can't delay bugfixes with the argument that they could
introduce new bugs, otherwise we can as well stop fixing bugs.
Also note that this stuff is being tested aggressively for a very long
time by lots of people, it's not a last minute patch like the xdr
highmem deadlock ;).
Don't take me wrong, I'm not saying that Marcelo is too conservative,
quite the opposite, I'm simply not so pessimistic that the stuff won't
go in ;).
