That's an interesting bug in drivers/char/mem.c.  PAGE_COPY is wrong,
for archs with separate execute permission or write-only mappings.
The correct argument in drivers/char/mem.c should be vma->vm_page_prot.

We're both wrong.  I misread the Alpha code: it does have exec-only
pages.  What it doesn't have is write-only.  And exec-only pages
aren't relevant to GCC's requirements, which used to be
read-implies-exec (exec-only breaks exec-implies-read).
