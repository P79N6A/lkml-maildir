Subject: PATCH: (as230) Work around compiler error in proc_misc.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew:
A change you recently applied to fs/proc/proc_misc.c included a comment
about splitting a seq_printf into two pieces to work around a bug in
gcc-2.95.3.  Unfortunately gcc-2.96 still chokes on the statements.  The
patch below makes it work better, albeit at the cost of generating a
little more code.
Please apply if you think this is correct.
