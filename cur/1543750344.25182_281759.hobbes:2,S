Sure.  I noticed it while going through your patch, that's all.  If
you find the time for a second patch, that would be nice.  Casts are a
very effective obfuscation method and most are pretty simple to avoid.
Maybe I should check the kernel janitor list and add this point, if
it doesn't exist yet.

Yup.  Same as above, except for the janitor list.

You can say that again, Mr. Hat!

Personal style is hard to argue about.  And doesn't make much of a
difference anyway.

Sorry.  The whole function declaration is spread over three lines.  I
don't mind p***ing Linus off iff putting the return type on a seperate
line is sufficient to fit all the rest into a single line.  Doesn't
work here, so you get to argue in favor, not me. ;)

Agreed.  Google proposes "separate", btw.
