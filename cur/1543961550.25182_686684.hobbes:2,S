Wasn't something like this posted recently to linux-scsi:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/27/333
this is sitting in scsi-misc-2.6.git:
[SCSI] bug fix for free list handling
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-misc-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=a79cbe1aa5dd695f0ee012ecde1ff88b1192e326
which I gather will be pushed soon...
