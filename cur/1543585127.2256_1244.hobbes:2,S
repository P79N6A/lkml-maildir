linuxrc is executed iff:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is defined
you actually have a initrd mounted
/dev/console can be found and opened
a executable "/linuxrc" is in the ramdisk
Note: initramdisks need to be set up and prepared by your boot loader or with
the right structure on your boot media. You also need to have a filesystem on
the initrd which the kernel can detect without modules. But kernel does not
need to be able to read from the boot device since the image is read by
bootloader (e.g. boot-prom or 16bit bios).
