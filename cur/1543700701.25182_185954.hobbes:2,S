I do not care about devfs, and I believe/trust udev is a better
approach.
But I do have sth fair to say about this "unmaintained" part.
From my memory, at some point in time, somebody (Al Viro?) reviewed
devfs code and flamed the author in public (klml), throwing lots of bad
impolite words to him, which I think was the biggest reason that the
author stopped maintaining it. This was one of the projects that got
killed by flames, or improper handling with flames (another one that
comes to mind is CML2).
Correct (but not flame :-) me if I am wrong.
