I don't think "unique VM's" is right for Linux. Tasks that share
files are related just as much as those that share memory.
I'll be glad to fix "ps".
Would you accept a patch that assigned a new XID for every new
clone(0) child and also for every exec when the XID is shared?
This would let "ps" handle both POSIX and non-POSIX threads.
Would you accept such a patch that used a very large ID space?
If the XID were to suffer from wrap-around, "ps" would suffer
from a dangerous race condition that would make unrelated tasks
get shown as one process. I think I'd use a separate 64-bit
counter for each CPU, initialized to (this_cpu_number<<48).
Would you accept a patch that exposed identifiers for every
shareable part of a task? (kernel pointer values would work)
Example: a group of 8 related tasks might have 5 address
spaces total, which "ps" must use to determine total memory.
Would you accept a patch that made /proc listings output all
related tasks (those with the same XID) one after the other?
Without this, "ps" performance on large systems drops greatly.
(note that "ps" is unsorted by default for this reason)
Would you accept a patch that, for any group of related tasks,
prevented reuse of the initial PID by an unrelated task?
While a well-behaved thread package would not let the initial
task exit early, an evil thread package may well seek to
confuse the system administrator.
Would you accept a patch that prevented such reuse by returning
error codes?
Would you accept a patch that prevented such reuse by turning the
initial task into a zombie that waits for all related tasks
before it itself can be waited for?
Would you accept a patch that prevented such reuse by ripping
apart the task group, assigning new XID values to every task
in the group? (thus causing messy "ps" output again)
Would you accept a patch that prevented such reuse by simply
sending SIGKILL to any related task?

Would you accept a patch that implemented this ability by adding
a second kill() system call, perhaps with a scope flag?
Would you accept a patch that allowed kill-by-XID, so that the
PID wrap-around race condition would be eliminated? This could
be unrelated to the above, or it could be just a different scope.

Eh, not async SysV message queues I hope.
