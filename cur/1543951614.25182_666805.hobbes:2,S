Hang on. That does not look like an XID collision problem...
That code path basically means that the fileids/inode numbers match,
which would not be the case if we were talking about an XID collision
causing the reply cache to replay an old request...
That message rather symptomatic of a filehandle reuse problem. In other
words a NFS filehandle appears to be reused to label a regular file
after it has been used for a directory with the same fileid/inode
number. That is a definite server bug.
Are you sure that you are using the regular kernel nfs server?
