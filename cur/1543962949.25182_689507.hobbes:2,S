This has been discussed already:

I understand that the idea of the trailing wildcard was to allow for
future extensions, however in the case of i2c I can't foresee any such
extension. On top of that, it really only matters for external drivers
(for in-tree drivers, if the alias format changes, the drivers will
also be updated so no harm done) and I don't think external drivers are
worth the effort and cost of anticipating a change which most certainly
will never happen.
