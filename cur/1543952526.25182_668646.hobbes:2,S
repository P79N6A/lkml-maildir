Hi Ingo,
This is a great big pile of x86 unification and Xen bugfix patches.
They build and boot for me on 64-bit and 32-bit (PAE and non-PAE).
Patches are based on x86.git#testing as of this morning.
The overview:
 - a couple of Xen bugfixes, which are 2.6.24 and 2.6.25 material
 - a bunch of x86 cleanups and unifications, mostly around pgalloc
 - some Xen fixes and improvements:
   - unify PAE/non-PAE pagetable handling
   - implement sysenter where applicable
Thanks,
	J
