Subject: directory "net/core" ignored by bitkeeper :-/

Try this in the official 2.4 tree:
touch net/ipv4/foo.c
touch net/core/bar.c
bk extras
=>   net/ipv4/foo.c
                     !!!
I am not a bitkeeper wizard, so I can only suggest removing "core"
from Bitkeeper/etc/ignore (as opposed to renaming "net/core" :-D)
Do many people have "core" files in their developments tree? So often
it becomes a major inconvenience? ("major" = more than ignoring
net/core)
Cheers,
Marc.
