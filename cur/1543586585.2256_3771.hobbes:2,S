If you are still running X with enabled DRI, then it is known problem.
When
DRI is enabled in X, mga driver randomly reprograms some Matrox
acceleration
registers (color depth, screen width, byte ordering) - so you must use
same depth and resolution in both X and on console if you are using DRI.
I believe that it is problem which thunder7 sees. I never got reported
that
matroxfb just decided itself in the middle of screen to do something
else,
it was always tracked to X running on (invisible) background, but still
playing with accelerator.

P.S.: You can try 'fbset -accel false', but fixing X is better.
Unfortunately,
nobody cares...
