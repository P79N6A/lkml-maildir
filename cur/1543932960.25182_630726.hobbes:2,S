Oh, wow. That's just really bogus. So the kernel message about
	PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 9 of bridge 0000:00:01.0
was perfectly fine, and we did absolutely the right thing.
But it also says that if the graphics adaptor really had a resource mapped 
at 0xc0000000 - 0xcfffffff by the BIOS, then that mapping never worked at 
all, since it never had any bridge mapping it could rely on. So our 
decision to unmap that one as invalid was _also_ right.
Damn. Very irritating.
You know what? I think this simple (BUT TOTALLY UNTESTED!) patch will get 
your case right, and I think it is preferable to just always lowering the 
"minimum" starting point.
What it does is to just take the minimum PCI address for new allocations 
(which is only used for the case where we don't have an explicit starting 
point for the parent bus anyway!), and just saying "we'll always align it 
down to the required alignment of the allocation".
I'm not exactly 100% happy with it, but it does mean that if we need a big 
area, we'll relax the suggested starting point by that amount. It's not 
wonderful, but it essentially admits that the minimum for the allocations 
is really just a hint, and if we need lots of space for a resource, we'll 
relax the minimum point appropriately.
So in your case, it should *result* in the exact same situation that your 
patch did, but at the same time, when dealing with the (more common) case 
of smaller allocations, we still continue to try to avoid being too close 
to the top-of-memory.
So it's not perfect, but perhaps it is a good compromise between being 
careful and having to make room?
Does this work for your case?
