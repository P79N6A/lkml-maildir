This is all getting into some very complicated issues.....

The smp_rmb is such a big problem? You have seqlock, rcu etc all in there 
as well. I doubt that this is more efficient.

Ahh. Yes that is an interesting issue. If a device driver cannot handle 
this then _begin must prohibit module loading. That means not allowing 
stop_machine_run I guess which should not be that difficult.
