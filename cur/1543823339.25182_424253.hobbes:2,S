Every one of our ASUS P4C800-E and ASUS P4C800 based machines that I've
installed a 2.6.16 smp based kernel on is logging messages of the form:
EDAC MC0: UE page 0x1fffa, offset 0x0, grain 4096, row 0, labels ":":
i82875p UE
every second or so. So I've downgraded them back to 2.6.15. I believe
the message is moaning that the ECC memory has unrecoverable errors.
However, the memory in the machines I've tried passes memtest. And
I'd've expected system hangs which we don't get.
So what's wrong?
