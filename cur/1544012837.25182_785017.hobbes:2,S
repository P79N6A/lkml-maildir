It really depends on what we're tracing. If we're interested in just the
allocation hotspots, a section will do just fine. However, if we're
tracing memory footprint, we need to take into store the object pointer
returned from kmalloc() and kmem_cache_alloc() so we can update
call-site statistics properly upon kfree().
So I suppose we need both, a section for per call-site statistics and a
hash table for the object -> call-site mapping.
