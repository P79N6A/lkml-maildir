I realized, that from a snapshot point of view, it would be easy to cope
with a separate library module + additional binary interface. As far as
I gathered the main argument against another binary interface is that
upgrading one driver would break the other ones that may still be
installed on the system. It would be no problem to update all of them at
the same time. The snapshots include all the DRM sources anyway, they
just build the DRM for a single type of card right now.
The snapshots have been split into a common and a hardware-specific part
some time ago. Just move the DRM into the common part of the snapshots
and make it build and upgrade all DRM drivers at the same time. This way
a change in the binary interface won't break any other drivers (provided
that DRM CVS is the authoritative source for *all* DRM drivers that rely
on that library module).
Regards,
  Felix
