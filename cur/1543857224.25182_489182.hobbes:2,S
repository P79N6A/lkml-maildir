I was afraid of that... Where is the lock on the i_mutex suppose 
to be released ? I can't grasp the codepath from within an interrupt back 
to the fs layer.

Is there any way to see if it is missing interrupts ? Enabling the 
debugging in the areca driver isn't a good idea on this machine, it's a
heavely IO loaded machine, and the problem seems to take some time to occur.
I *does* happen less often with a 2.6.19 kernel however. 
The task dump takes > 10 seconds, which causes the softlock detector to 
trigger. Is there any objection to a patch which disables the lockup 
detector during the dump ? It isn't a big issue, since al it does is dump 
a stacktrace.
I've enabled most debugging now, I'll see of i can run both a disk and VM 
stresstest.
I'll put a .config and a dmesg of the machine booting at 
http://www.jdi-ict.nl/plain/
 for those who want to look at it.
