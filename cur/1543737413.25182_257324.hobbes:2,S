Right.   That's a restriction of the currently-implemented CKRM controllers.

Well if it is indeed the case that the CKRM *framework* is up to the task
of being used to deliver the cpuset functionality then that's the way we
should go, no?  It's more work and requires coordination and will deliver
later, but the eventual implementation will be better.
But I'm still not 100% confident that the CKRM framework is suitable. 
Mainly because the CKRM and cpuset teams don't seem to have looked at each
other's stuff enough yet.
