Subject: [PATCH] 2.5: don't miss a preemption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/4/15/135

Current kernel preemption code opens a small window between the check
for need_resched in schedule and the setting of preempt_count to zero in
preempt_schedule.  While this window is generally short (a few cycles)
the resulting period of non-preemptibility could be as long as the next
timer tick - much longer, in fact, if a lock is obtained in the interim.
This patch checks for need_resched in preempt_schedule after setting
preempt_count back to zero, before returning.  The overhead is
negligible and it is crucial to never miss a preemption opportunity.
Also fixes/clarifies some comments.  Patch is against 2.5.8 ... enjoy,
	Robert Love
