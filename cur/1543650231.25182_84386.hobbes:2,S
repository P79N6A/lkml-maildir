The "make dep" stage generates .ver files for all files listed in 
*/Makefile:export-objs. At the same time, it creates a zero-length file
corresponding to each .ver file in .tmp_export-objs, which are needed to 
afterwards construct include/linux/modversions.h, which is basically
	#include <linux/module/path/obj.ver>
for all objects we created the .ver files for earlier. Basically,
.tmp_export-objs is a complicated way to create a list of filenames,
the reason we cannot just append names to one file is that multiple
'make's may run in parallel (make -j), so that appending to a single file
would be racy.

Well, for some traditional reasons, there is a distinction between
"make clean" and "make mrproper", where only the latter really removes 
everything.
