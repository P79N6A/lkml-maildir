It was suggested to try RedHat 2.4.9 trees or 2.4.18-rc1. Both attempts
leave the i2o_block module initializing (no oops/panic, just boredom).
2.4.18-rc1 says this in /var/log/messages:

Would a corrupt partition table do this to me?  Because it is corrupt. 
I'm trying this to fdisk it.
Thanks again, I appreciate any insight,
