Right.  I was pointing out the possibilities but because we do
some tricky things.  Mostly I was wondering about the hlist for
the list of tasks.  Now if a task is on that list we should have
a struct pid_link pointing at our struct pid, so it shouldn't fool
kmemleak but I'm still a little curious if all of those hlist_heads are
NULL pointers.

Yes that sounds like a leak.
