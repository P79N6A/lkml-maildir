I'm going to apply this patch (by hand, your email client corrupted
the patch massively, adding newlines and whatnot all over the patch).
But I'm going to rename the option to be just PACKET_ORIGDEV
because although bonding is the only user of this orig_dev
decapsulation method, that might not always be true and it'd
be a shame to give a special cased name when it is not deserved
here.
But please do fix your email client for future patch submissions.
Thanks.
