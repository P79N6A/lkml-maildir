Whenever klibc gets merged it would probably be good to add a
libemu86. Did you get one put together that you're happy with?
Between the ROM attribute, klibc and libemu86 there will then be
enough support to write a tiny POST program that POSTs secondary and
non-x86 primary cards at boot. It will still need a little support in
sysfs for PCI bus VGA routing but we're almost there.
