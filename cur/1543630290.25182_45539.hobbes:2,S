make xconfig
drivers/ide/Config.in: 129: can't handle dep_bool/dep_mbool/dep_tristate condition
Your dep_* conditions are wrong.  The conditional fields require
$CONFIG, not a bare CONFIG.
Always check config changes under both oldconfig and xconfig.  xconfig
is the only CML1 code that does a full syntax check, the other CML1
*config rules silently ignore many syntax errors.
