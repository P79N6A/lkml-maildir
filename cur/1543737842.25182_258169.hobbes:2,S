Someone should yes. There are lots of fascinating things happen when
hotplug opens a system file, it gets assigned fd 2 and then we write to

Userspace to userspace execution is quite precisely defined. What
happens for kernel->userspace isn't so I have no problem with the kernel
attaching hotplug to the system console.
