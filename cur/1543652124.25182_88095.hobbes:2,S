  Ok, it just happened again.  Everything got slow, changing desktops,
starting new aterms,. etc.  I flipped to a tty, and started a vmstat
log,
and went back into X, and reprioritised stuff with a terminal that was
just bearably slow enough to work.  After renicing X stuff got a bit
better.  A little.  After renicing my aterms, it got slightly better
still.
alan@aries:~$ sudo renice -19 `pgrep X`

After flipping back to my vmstat log tty, I found that vmstat had
segfaulted instead of run, I didnt see it because I ran it in the
background and ran a tail of the file it was supposed to log to.  I'm
using procps 2.0.7 as distributed in RH8.0, which I assume is too old a
version.  I attached an strace of it running if anyone is curious.
  To give an example ofhow intermitently slow this is, I took one of my
reniced aterms, and tried running aterm with the options I usually use.
I started another instance of aterm elsewhere, and in my current terminal,
I ran the following:
alan@aries:~$ time /usr/local/bin/aterm -tr -trsb -fade 60 -bg blue -fg -e
exit
real    0m0.924s
user    0m0.017s
sys     0m0.014s
alan@aries:~$ time /usr/local/bin/aterm -tr -trsb -fade 60 -bg blue -fg -e
exit
real    0m4.895s
user    0m0.018s
sys     0m0.018s
alan@aries:~$ time /usr/local/bin/aterm -tr -trsb -fade 60 -bg blue -fg -e
exit
real    0m1.436s
user    0m0.014s
sys     0m0.018s
alan@aries:~$ time /usr/local/bin/aterm -tr -trsb -fade 60 -bg blue -fg -e
exit
real    0m0.797s
user    0m0.017s
sys     0m0.017s
alan@aries:~$ time /usr/local/bin/aterm -tr -trsb -fade 60 -bg blue -fg -e
exit
real    0m1.122s
user    0m0.017s
sys     0m0.019s
  I had enough time to run aterm this way about four times before I got
that other instance of aterm to give me a usable prompt.
I'll go upgrade my procps so I have a working vmstat for you next time,
sorry about that.  Whose shall I use? (riel/rml or calahan, or both?)
