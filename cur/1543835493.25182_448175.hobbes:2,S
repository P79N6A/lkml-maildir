No, I'm talking about the *other* direction now: I'm looking at a file
in /dev and I want to find the corresponding sysfs device (if any).
Anyway turns out that sysfs dev numbers are not unique either -- some
devices with major=1 apper twice in sysfs. To give a random example:
$ cat /sys/block/ram8/dev /sys/class/mem/random/dev
1:8
1:8
And these aren't symlinks.
