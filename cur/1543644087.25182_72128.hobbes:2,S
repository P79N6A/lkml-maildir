Nope. But I believe I found the root cause: it apparently takes
long enough to kick all the cpus the NMI oopser goes off during
one of the many long ints-off sections in the bootstrap phase. My
burning question now is why this only showed up in 2.5.36. Somehow
I mistook a rather blatant (c.f. SIGEMT) NMI oops for TSD %cr4 #GP.
I'm going to guess the NMI oopser was not eager enough to trip
beforehand and recent changes repaired that. Is this close?
If so, it's probably not worth mucking around with the bootstrap
sequence to deal with something this minor. It's not like it can
be mistaken for having hung, as console output is very consistent.
Maybe we should give NUMA-Q a couple of minutes instead of 5s?
Thanks,
Bill
