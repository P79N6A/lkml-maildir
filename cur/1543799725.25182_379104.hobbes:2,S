Hello Avuton,
Thank you for your reply to my inquiry.  My Opterons are 244s and they
are not dual core.  Like you, my setup has passed 24 hours of memtest on
at least 2 or 3 separate occasions.
I'm strongly suspicious of the MB since a BIOS upgrade improved my
situation but there is still instability.  Nothing else I've done has
had as marked an effect on stability as that BIOS upgrade.
I've even turned off every spiggot on the MB and replaced them with
their own circuit boards, all to no avail.  This thing still hangs
randomly - sometimes after a couple of days, sometimes after 3 weeks,
sometimes multiple times in an evening.
I'll take a look at the thread which you referenced.  I also plan to
replace the MB due to my aforementioned suspicions.
Thanks!
Andy
