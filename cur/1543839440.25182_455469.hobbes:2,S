This isn't to handle the edge-triggered case, that return value is to 
shut off the interrupt entirely in the case of a device that is 
asserting its interrupt but no driver claims to be handling it. 
Otherwise the interrupt storm could cause the machine to simply lock up. 
It doesn't just disable that ISR either, the interrupt line is disabled 
in the interrupt controller which may disable other devices using that line.
