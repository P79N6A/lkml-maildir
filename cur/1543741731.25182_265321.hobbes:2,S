I think I have one of such cases.
I am one of the members of the robotic soccer team from the University 
of Oporto, and a couple of months ago we were looking for new 
motherboards for our robots, because we are starting to need new 
hardware (on-board lan, usb2.0, etc.).
We really don't need excepcional performance, but we really, really need 
low power consumption, so lowering the clock on a standard mainboard 
seemed to be the best cost/performance scenario.
Could this driver be used to keep a standard p4 processor at say 25% 
clock speed at all times?
