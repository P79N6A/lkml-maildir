So, has a patch emerged yet? I'd like to help checking and fixing things.
There shouldn't be too much fallout from that. I had a patch to uninclude 
sched.h from module.h in -mm for some time about a year ago.
All fixes necessary at that time should be in Linus' tree by now, just the 
final patch to module.h got dropped.
