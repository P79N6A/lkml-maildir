OK, I had to give this some thought, but I can certainly see it's
usefulness (and don't want to take away flexibility); though I still say
that for a cracker, the effective set is a non-issue.  Feel free to stomp
on this, but would you consider the addition of an fM to mask out further
inheritance?  (the whole 'inheritance' thing, while being very useful, is
also very powerful and carries some serious security implications) 
What of my suggestion for compatibilty of the new cap-enable bit?
cheers,
