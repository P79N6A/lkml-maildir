The problem I have (and this is why I don't setup host resources
properly on multi-host PPCs yet) is that some hosts can have several
non-contiguous ranges (especially with memory, IO is usually a single
contiguous range).
There are simply not enough resource "slots" in the current structures
to handle all possibles cases.
They basically have a host bridge register in which each low bit enables
decoding of a 256Mb region in the range 0xn0000000 and each high bit
enable decoding of a 16Mb region in the range 0xFn000000
The typical setup is to have one (or more) 256Mb regions, and one 16Mb
region, but that can change from model to model.
