I have in my mailbox somewhere the beginnings of an implementation of
this, from David Howells (the ornaments approach); I think he ran out
of time to work on it.  Rather than pursue it, if there's someone
interested in giving Linux a way to access at least some of the
Solaris/BSD procfs debug interface...
The biggest problem with ptrace is the way it overloads signals.  It
makes figuring out what events are pretty tricky (see the patches I
just posted for some workarounds on this), and it makes debugging a
signal-intensive process extremely awkward.  For instance, in a lot of
cases you'll lose or confuse the realtime payload entirely.
I don't think there is anything you could do here that would not break
strace/gdb's uses of ptrace, however; any incremental changes would
toast them.
