True.  Do you know if ext2/3 allocates the block even for empty files?  So
if you create the file, it should be sparse until you write something to it,
right?  Does the touch command do this?

Hmm, any experiments with more files per dir (maybe 500 or 1000)?  I'm not
sure if you're going to use a directory full block with 100 files per dir in
ext2/3.

Are these indirects stored in the tree, or do you have many partially filled
indirect blocks?

How many superblocks are there in reiser3?  Also, the bitmap locations are
static, and allocated at mkfs time?  How is that done so fast for large
filesystems?
