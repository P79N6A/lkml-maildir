The OHCI code shouldn't have changed either, unless you're
maybe using an old Compaq-brand chipset.  However, if you
enable CONFIG_USB_DEBUG and send the "async" and "registers"
files from the relevant /sys/class/usb_host/usbN directory,
it should be easy to tell whether there's an issue at that
particular level.
