Hi Marc,
I took the patch for a spin and found a few glitches.
A patch is attached to fix them.
1. The kernel oops'ed in vt_ioctl due to driver_data
being NULL in the tty.  I copied the relevant fix from
2.6.5-rc2-mm2.
2. I did not configure the in-kernel statd daemon for
NFS.  That caused a BUG() in mon.c:nsm_monitor()
because the handle was never initialized.
3. A typo fix in ipmi/af_ipmi.c.
Thanks,
Shantanu
