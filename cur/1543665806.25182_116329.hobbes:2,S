I don't think gcc 2.96 had that problem. I've not seen it there, but 
gcc 3.0.x certainly does and a gcc 3.0.x early 3.1.x built kernels seems
to explode randomly under load probably for this reason.
I've also not seen any problemd with this on gcc 3.2. Valgrind has some
notes on affected compilers as the valgrind app also picks up this
violation by the compiler.
