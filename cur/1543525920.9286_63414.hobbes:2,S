I am trying to debug lowlatency-2.2.14-B1 + Linux-2.2.14aa7 with
"/bin/sync" stuck in D state.  I applied 2.2.14-ikd1 and was able to solve
all FAILED hunks except in entry.S for the following code snippit:
-----part of entry.S.rej-------
        testl $(VM_MASK),EFLAGS(%esp)
        movl %esp,%eax
        jne v86_signal_return
+ #ifndef CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUGGING
        xorl %edx,%edx
+ #else
+       pushl $0
+       pushl %eax
+ #endif
        call SYMBOL_NAME(do_signal)
+ #ifdef CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUGGING
+       addl $8,%esp
+ #endif
        jmp restore_all
        ALIGN
  v86_signal_return:
+ #ifdef CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUGGING
+       pushl %eax
+ #endif
        call SYMBOL_NAME(save_v86_state)
        movl %eax,%esp
+ #ifndef CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUGGING
        xorl %edx,%edx
+ #else
+       pushl $0
+       pushl %eax
+ #endif
        call SYMBOL_NAME(do_signal)
+ #ifdef CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUGGING
+       addl $8,%esp
+ #endif
        jmp restore_all
-----end entry.S.rej snippit------
I think I can fix the FAILED hunk but I would feel more confident
if I knew what this code was doing.  Can you give a brief explanation of
the ikd additions in this area?
