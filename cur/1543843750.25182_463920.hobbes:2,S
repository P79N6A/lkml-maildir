Subject: [PATCH 0 of 11] Use SEEK_{SET,CUR,END} instead of hardcoded values
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/16/132

In July, David Howells added SEEK_{SET,CUR,END} definitions to include/linux/fs.h
The following patches convert offenders which were found by grep'ing the source
tree.
