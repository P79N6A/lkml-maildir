IMHO its a brilliant idea to defer it this way to a safe place. I just
had to adapt the type of flip to "usigned long" (otherwise gcc spits
warnings around).
Eventhough i never ran in such a deadlock of course it looks much safer
now this way. I tested this patch and it seems to not break anything.
Applied without changes.
Thanks a lot,
Frank
