Hm, what about something related to the vendor "AK Modul-Bus Computer GmbH"?
I think my driver might (!) only work for their firmware implementations...
cypress_akmb
cypress_akmodbus
cypress_akmodulbus
The third would be my favourite. Are there any length restrictions for 
driver/files names? Is it a problem to use parts of company names for this 
purpose (I saw lego, rio, auerswald, etc.) or does one need to ask them for 
permission in this case?

I changed it. I had the rule "only tabs for indentation" on my mind and tried 
to choose the closest ;-) Now I first use tabs followed by spaces for 
fine-tuning (if needed).
What about the macro discussion?
If there's any convention I'm happy to follow it...
Thanks,
Oliver
