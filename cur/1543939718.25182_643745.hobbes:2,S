I've reviewed all of the pending patches in the stable queue for this
speedup, and applied them where necessary; it was useful, since I
detected a buffer head leak in one of the patches while I was at it.
The ext4/jbd2 code as a whole still needs to be reviewed for this
speedup, but I don't want to fix this in the initial stable push, lest
I break something by accident.  I'll put it in the "TO DO" queue.
