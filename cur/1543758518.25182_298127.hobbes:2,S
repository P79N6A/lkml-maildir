There is (was). I have three kernels I was testing against. 2.6.11-rc4-bk4, 2.6.11-rc4-bk10 and 
2.6.11-rc4-mm1. I moved onto 2.6.11-rc4-mm1 for my main debugging (inserting lots of printks and 
generally doing stuff that was going to crash). I hope to reproduce the faults against the vanilla 
2.6.11-rc4 kernels and I'm now testing with 2.6.11-rc5-bk2.
As per the original bug report, 2.6.11-rc4-bk(4/10) locked in [<c0268574>] 
get_active_stripe+0x224/0x260. Although unlike -mm1 I'm not sure of the sequence of events that 
caused it and it's not anywhere as easy to hit. I am willing to investigate as time allows however.
Testing 2.6.11-rc5-bk2 and it of course is flatly refusing to misbehave. I'll keep beating on it for 
a couple of days and after writing 3TB with 2.6.11-rc5-bk2, I'll go back to the older kernels and 
try and reproduce the failure there. It *did* lockup 4 times in a row in get_active_stripe on the 
older non -mm kernels.
Regards,
Brad
