In 2.4.0-test10, in my kspamd kernel-thread that's like a hollowed-out
kswapd, I have x86 asm code like this...
[enter from in-kernel init]
[open 3 FDs on tty1]
LOOP:
	pushf
	pusha
	call schedule
	popa
	popf
	[ here is some code to use the write syscall to send 
		one byte to FD 1. A d, for example. ]
jmp LOOP
The d's get written until a syslog happens. If I do do_syslog(6,6,6); in
the C kspamd wrapper code it's about like so...
<gobs of d's>ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
dddddddddddddddINIT: entering runlevel 8
	[more normal logging stuff, ext2 warnings and so on]
If I don't do the do_syslog() the same thing happens somewhat earlier,
i.e. on a from-the-kernel-itself syslog.
Boot is normal. I can't shift&pg_up vt1, which normally I can, but I can
switch vt's, email you, etc.  /proc/4/status for kspamd shows
Name:   kspamd
State:  R (running)
Pid:    4
PPid:   1
PIDs 1, 2 and 3 don't have any open FD's. My simplistic wrapper pegs CPU
use at 1.0. 
Why don't my d's continue?
Might this be easier to do in a 2.0 kernel?
