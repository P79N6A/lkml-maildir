Well this gives the impression that SLUB depends on larger orders. It 
*can* take advantage of higher order allocations. No must. It may be a 
performance benefit to be able to do higher order allocs though (it is not 
really established yet what kind of tradeoffs there are).
Looks fine to me. If this is stable then I want this to be merged ASAP 
(deal with the issues later???) .... Good stuff.
