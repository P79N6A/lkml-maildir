Why should we do that?

In that case the correct approach here too would be to _shift_
ATARI_KBD_CORE from arch/m68k/Kconfig to drivers/input/Kconfig
and *then* use "select" from the config options that require it in
drivers/input/keyboard/Kconfig and drivers/input/mouse/Kconfig
(and repeat for other such cases in arch/...)
