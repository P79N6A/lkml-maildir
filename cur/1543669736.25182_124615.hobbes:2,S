Shaheed, I think that task->cpu_allowed covers your need, since it
describes a mask of cpu�'s allowed to run the task. CPU migration, for
example, is implemented in current scheduler by saving the
current cpu_allowed, forcing it to contain only the destination CPU and
then restoring it.
I think it's carried over by fork(), but have been unable to find
it on the sources.
HT is accounted as a NUMA SMP system with strong memory affinity
for his 2 cores, so that when running 2 HT processors (2+2 cores),
the tasks are kept preferably on the same HT processor and just bounce
cores, since they share the same cache (don't know exactly L1, L2 or
both, tough).
Greets, Antonio.
