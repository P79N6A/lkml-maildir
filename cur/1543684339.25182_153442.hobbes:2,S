You should look at Patrick Mochel's stuff that shall be getting in
the official tree this month hopefully. It does that (among others)

The older pm_ model is deprecated.

PCI is broken since it does both (and thus, if we call both rounds
of notifiers, we end up suspending PCI twice, the second time without
any ordering constraints). In my trees, I comment out that "legacy"
stuff (though I also don't call the old-style pm_* stuff anymore
neither)

All that will change to a unified mecanism soon

SAVE_STATE is going away. The proper semantics are
SUSPEND and POWERDOWN (+/-). The later is optional and really only
needed by drivers who need to do their last powerdown step with
interrupts disabled.
The SUSPEND state is responsible for blocking further IOs, and
snapshoting the state. It can enter the HW suspend mode too, depending
on the "state" argument you pass.
The actual policy of what shall be done to "block" IOs is
function-specific. Typically, a network driver will just stop the Rx
side and drop any Tx packet (it just need to call netif_stop_queue()
actually, but it can drop pending packets in the Tx ring). A block
driver (IDE, SCSI) must complete any pending request and keep new
incoming ones held in the BIO queue. This has been implemented properly
for IDE already, SCSI still need work.

The USB "device" drivers shall just rely on the Device Model
infrastructure to have their suspend/resume callbacks be called at the
appropriate time. If they take care of finishing pending IOs (or
cancelling, as you like, depending on the driver function) and not
issuing new URBs until they are resumed, there shall be no problem, the
HCD should be idle when it's own suspend callback is reached. Which is
why I beleive it's safe/better to actually cancel pending URBs and
reject any new one in the HCD driver when it's in suspend state.
