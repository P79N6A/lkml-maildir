A late follow-up to this thread. I've added the following text
to the mlockall() manual pag under BUGS:
    Since kernel 2.6.9, if a privileged process calls 
    mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) and later drops privileges
    (CAP_IPC_LOCK), then subsequent memory allocations
    (e.g., mmap(2), sbrk(2)) will fail if the 
    RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit is encountered.
The change will be in man-pages 2.23.
Cheers,
Michael
