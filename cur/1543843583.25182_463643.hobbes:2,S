If the latter is a suggestion for how an out-of-tree rule for a
tracepoint definition should look, it's a terrible one.
Alan's example is much more fragile, from a maintenance perspective,
than Karim's.  Plus, it's much more difficult to implement, whether
you plan to inject no-ops at compile time, just record locations and
stack offsets, or actually place some tracing code (heaven forbid)
that the compiler could optimize for that context.
I still think that this is off-topic for the patch posted.  I think we
should debate the implementation of tracepoints/markers when someone posts a
patch for some.  I think it's rather scurrilous to complain about
code NOT submitted.  Ingo has even mis-characterized the not-submitted
instrumentation patch, by saying it has 350 tracepoints when it has no
such thing.  I counted 58 for one architecture (with only 8 being
arch-specific).
