	I using 2.1.131 now, but I think no much differces between 2.0
and 2.1 console driver.

	uni_pagedir realy does not take much space, but because that
inverse_translations[] translate screen glyph to codeset, so 8bit -> 8bit.
All four tables take only 1k memory space. If we need translation from
Unicode (16bit -> 8bit) trivial 256 byte table is not enough. But since
the full translation never (or very rarely) needed we can do something like
struct _uni2char_ {
struct _uni2char_ *next_page;
unsigned char page;
unsigned char code;
} uni2c_tbl[256];
and use this table:
unsigned char
Unicode_to_charset(unsigned short unicode)
{
unsigned char page=((unicode>>8)&0xff),sym=(unicode&0xff);
struct _uni2char_ *u;
  for(u=&uni2c_tbl[sym];u;u=u->next_page) 
    if(u->page==page)
	return u->code;
  return -1; /* not found */
}
void
uni_tbl_init(unsigned short *translation)
{
unsigned char sym;
struct _uni2char_ *u;
int i;
/* uni2c_tbl must be cleaned first, I skip it */
  for(i=0;i<256;i++){
    sym=translation[i]&0xff
    u=&uni2c_tbl[sym];
    if(!u->page){
      u->page=((translation[i]>>8)&0xff);
      u->code=i;
      u->next_page=NULL;
    } else { /* create u->next_page, also skiped */ }
}
	In that way work translation on my home home machine.
I set translation table only for current translation for reduce memory
usage;

	Imo translation must be changed only for permanent changing
of translation table (^[(X ^[)X). Temporary switching using ^[[10m ^[[11m ^[[12m
sequences must not change translation. But I prefer add one another
TIOCLINUX ioctl for setting translation table by user which will contain all
Unicode symbols needed for him & never switch it. IMHO this way the best.

	In case of additional TIOCLINUX user can set U+F000..U+F1FF symbols
if it needed for him, or don't set it at all if not using them.

	If you intresting look at
ftp://linux.esc.kharkov.com/pub/Linux/myown/selection.patch
it allow paste in UTF mode for current kernel. It paste in UTF-8 if
keyboard (not screen!) switched to UNICODE mode. But if we would have
a Unicode screen buffer paste in UTF-8 is more simplier than in ASCII.

	The existing screen buffer contain not from screen glyphs only.
It also keep screen atributes. So the best way imho not using unicode
buffer instead of screen, but add Unicode buffer as additional to existing
one. In this case we have no troubles with existing /dev/vcs* interface,
but variant of /dev/vcs* that will be work with unicode buffer also useful.
	In case we have an unicode selection buffer we can add another
additional ioctl call that allow get/set to/from user space contain of selection
buffer. Using this ioctl cut/paste between textual console & Xwindows
screen will be also possible.
	I can rewrite this part of console driver to make all of this
possible, but I think now is too late for including this new console
driver to 2.2 kernel. So just wait for kernel 2.3 started. Thats the
reason why I write my three small patches for console driver (one bugfix
keyboard & selection addition) - this small pathces possibly will be
included in 2.2 kernel & imho it's better than nothing.
