Nicholas,
You have an *exceptional* ability don't see what you don't want to see. 
It has already happened with Persistent Reservations over pass-through 
backend (see the end of 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/7/10/328
 and 
subsequent messages in this thread) and now this is happening with 
configfs. I already 2 times described you why configfs isn't appropriate 
for a SCSI target (the first time in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/21/259
), but you keep refusing to see it. 
In short:
1. Kernel can't create subdirectories in configfs
2. Sysfs doesn't allow files >4K
3. What you have been doing to live with the above limitations is 
implementing "access allowed only for explicitly specified initiators 
and forbidden for all others" security approach. This approach is 
unacceptable on practice. The majority of people simply define available 
devices for a target and don't bother with listing initiators, which 
allowed to connect to it. But you forces them to do that and keep doing 
again and again for each related network change.
In contrast, sysfs allows kernel to create subdirectories. It will allow 
to workaround the 4K limitation by a simple subdirectories hierarchy. 
So, both security approaches ("access allowed only for explicitly 
specified initiators and forbidden for all others" and "access forbidden 
only for explicitly specified initiators and allowed for all others") 
can be seamlessly implemented on sysfs as it is currently done on procfs 
in SCST.
