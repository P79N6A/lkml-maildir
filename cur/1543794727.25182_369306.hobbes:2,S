It sounds unlikely.  This hang is associated with crossing the 2G boundary
isn't it?
I don't think we've seen a sysrq-T trace from the hang?

Yes, there are still windows.
Another thing the unmap_mapping_range() does is to push pte-dirty bits into
the software-dirty flags, so the modified data does get written.  If we
didn't do this, a page which was dirtied via mmap before the direct-io
write would get written back _after_ the direct-io write, arguably causing
corruption.
