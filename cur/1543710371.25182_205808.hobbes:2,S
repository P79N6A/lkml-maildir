Since the openib.org mailing lists don't seem to be alive yet, I'll
bring this up here..
Can we get this split out into the following components?
	* kernel level infiniband access layer
	* lowlevel hardware driver (aka mellanox driver)
	* all other 'upper layer protocols'
All the existing code has big problems with how it interfaces to the
kernel memory management.. it doesn't use the regular interfaces like
get_user_pages, pci_map_page, and pci_map_sq, and goes and looks at the
guts of the pagetables directly. 
This is either a problem with the kernel interfaces made available, or a
design issue with the existing codebases. Can someone please tell me
which it is?

Somone asked my why I work on this free (

software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life." -- Charles Shultz
