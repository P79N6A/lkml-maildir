Personally, I find the argument that it's hardware-specific control code
a much better reason for it to belong in the kernel. But now it's a config
option, everyone can do what they like ... so there's no need to argue
back and forth any more. Not to say the in-kernel one doesn't need some
fixing up, but we're planning on doing that later this year.
