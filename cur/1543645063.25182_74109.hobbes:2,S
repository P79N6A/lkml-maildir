Subject: PING: Failed to install socket filter after kernel update

Okay I finally made it through my kernel recompile with iptables 1.2.7a in
there, and it seems to be working (I can do a #iptables -L and it lists my
default chains) but there's about a 10-second delay with anything
network-related now. When I ssh to the box, it used to come up immediately,
now there's the delay. When I lynx to a site, delay. When I ping, I get
useful info, then a delay.
The is the output of a simple ping apple.com:
PING apple.com (17.254.3.183) from 10.1.1.8 : 56(84) bytes of data.
WARNING: failed to install socket filter

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 49.835/53.987/58.830/3.877 ms
Notice the time 15398ms... It comes up after a couple seconds with the
WARNING, then delays about 5 seconds, then spits out the ping info slowly,
even though the return times may be under 10ms.
So what's up with the failing to install socket filter stuff? What did I do
to my kernel? :-)
Machine info: RH 7.3 on a Dell PE 350, with a newly compiled 2.4.19 kernel
and compiled iptables 1.2.7a (tried 1.2.6a with same results). I have
completely removed ipchains.
If anyone wants to see my kernel config file, or some of the flags from it,
lemme know.
Thanks!!
