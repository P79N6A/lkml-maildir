I, for one, am not engaging into such flights of fancy as a platform
with larger than natural alignment requirements. Would you even read
what you're writing? The whole freaking world abandons silly platforms
and moves to x86 extensions and you're fantasizing about a return
to Cray-1. It just ain't happening!
My ass is completely at ease about being bitten by your imaginary monsters.
