Ok, I've done some more digging through the block layer. A lot of voodoo
in there, but gendisk seems to make sure it has its own reference to the
queue.
As gendisk drops it reference to the queue in del_gendisk(), I have to
assume that is would be invalid for any part of kernel to look at
disk->queue at this point (since it might now have been released).
So I think this patch should cover all bases. It cleanly kills of our
extra thread and also handles any requests that might be left behind.
I hope you can look at this soon as I'm eager to get rid of this oops.
