Because you really need to hold the BKL when you call sleep_on() family
of APIs, otherwise you have a very big race.
Also note that you in your code really should not call any of the
sleep_on() family of functions at all! It is a very very deprecated and
defective API!!!!
Can you give the URL to the code where you use this in?
(it is GPL code, right?)
