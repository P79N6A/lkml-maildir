There is #ifdef CONFIG_PM
around all the .suspend and .resume methods.
Technically they are PM_DEVICE_STATES or something,
that could really be under PM, and both SUSPEND and HIBERNATE
would depend on PM_DEVICE_STATES, but it is also possible to have
PM_DEVICE_STATES without SUSPEND and HIBERNATE.
oh no, I just suggested more instead of fewer config options:-O
but i agree, this can wait a bit...
