	Although 2.5.40 has been out for a while, I think I ought
to post this bug as I haven't seen any other mention of it.
	When I boot an 2.5.40 x86 kernel built with CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G,
and with a 920kB initial ramdisk (2.2MB uncompressed), I get a kernel
BUG() at highmem.c line 480, preceded by a message saying "scheduling
with KM_TYPE 15 held!"  The machine on which I experienced this
problem has 1.25GB of RAM.  The problem occurs with and without
CONFIG_PREEMPT.  All kernels that tried were SMP kernels running on a
uniprocessor.
	The problem does not occur if I build 2.5.40 with
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G or CONFIG_NOHIGMEM.  So, it's probably not causing
problems for many people, but I thought I should report it anyhow.
