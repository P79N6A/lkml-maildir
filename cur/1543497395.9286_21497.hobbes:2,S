It is, indirectly.  Alexey is right, it's the multicast filters - when I
set the limit to "3", the problems disappeared.
Maybe you're doing other stuff that requires multicasting?  Mbone, OSPF
routing, RIPv2, ...?

Yep.  I never saw it when a "tcpdump" was running (unless I put tcpdump to
non-promiscuous mode).

Yes, that's about the way it looked here as well.

Since 2.2.0-pre<something>.
For me, it went away as soon as I added "multicast_filter_limit=3" to
the insmod options ("insmod eepro100 multicast_filter_limit=3"), no
problems since then anymore.
