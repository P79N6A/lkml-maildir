Hm.  I was under the impression that this was the purpose of the
jounalling filesystem:  *continually* save information about the current
state of the system in general.  When something happens, it can easily
come up, with no loss of data, etc.  Am I misguided?
Oh, well, I fixed the problem temporarily.  I changed computers -- I'm
running on a P133 for now, which is working great - and hey, I can run X!
Hehehe...
The problem, I think, was either the CPU or the motherboard in the other
machine:  When I woke up after about an hour's worth of sleep, I decided
to fire up DOSEmu and play Final Fantasy on NESticle, the world's best NES
emulator, IMHO.  I did this for about *TWO MINUTES*, and my VGA screen
went to hell, and the system did a cold boot.  Then I got the most
wonderful thing in the world:
  System Configuration (C
Was all that printed of the startup message.  It didn't even print up the
CPU info, port information or *anything*.  Didn't read the boot sector of
*any* device, either.
So I pressed reset.  The system failed to init, and all I got was a very
sick sounding beep sequence.  It wasn't even a solid "beep," it was what
you'd hear if you had it beeping, but put a very high-speed fan in front
of it, with the pattern beep 2 seconds, silence 4.  It did this until I
powered down the system one minute later.
I booted it up 20 minutes later and it was fine.  Hm.
No longer is it my Linux box; my parents can use it as their Windows
computer... I traded them computers for the time being, until I can get my
own P133 or similar machine to run on.
Thank God that Linux doesn't depend on your exact system configuration
when you install it; I just took my hard drive and put it in the P133 from
the "5x86" machine and now I'm up and running no problem!  :-)
