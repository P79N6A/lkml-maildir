Needed rework due to pending changes in get_cmos_time().  Please
check the result.
Patches which affect arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:
	hpet-rtc-emulation-add-watchdog-timer.patch
	mark-cyc2ns_scale-readmostly.patch
	x86_64-mm-lost-ticks-dump-rip.patch
	x86_64-mm-pmtimer-dont-touch-pit.patch
	x86_64-mm-reenable-cmos-warning.patch
	x86_64-mm-time-style.patch
	x86_64-mm-year-check.patch
There are >1600 patches queued up already.  There's already a large RTC patch
series from Alessandro Zummo which has been queued for the last several
-mm's.
Your patches did merge up okayish but if they cause significant problems
I'll drop them, sorry.
