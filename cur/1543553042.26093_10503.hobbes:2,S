This will destroy one nice feature of list-style makefiles:
when you have and object both in obj-y and obj-m it will be removed
from obj-m with the old boiler-plates, not with your proposal.

The MIX_OBJS change is wrong.  It may not hurt the resulting
kernel image but you will build all export-objs, not only the
ones you actually have selected.  But we might get around this
with some $(filter ...) magic.

The idea looks great, but it looks like the implementation needs a little
bit work.
Keith do you want to hack on this now - or should I prepare a patch tomorrow?
