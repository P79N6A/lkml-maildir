Martin,
After a quick look, this patch looks OK (although I haven't had a chance to
test it yet).  I don't know what what was intended with a default cpu_power
of 0, but I don't believe that a value of SCHED_LOAD_SCALE should negatively
affect the isolated domains (versus any other value).
Note that sched_init() does use SCHED_LOAD_SCALE as a default.
