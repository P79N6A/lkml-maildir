The kernel source counts as "other materials".

Gee.  And how many installation have been running that firmware for how
many years without problems?  As I said before, other than it's age, there's
no reason to simply delete it.

We aren't talking about a module when it's compiled into the kernel.  In
the case(s) of modules, there are many ways to provide data (such as
firmware) without the aforementioned bloat everyone wants to bitch about.
And I'd like to point out the people screaming about bloat do not have
the hardware for which this driver is required and thusly will *never*
lose the coveted 128K for it's firmware.  There are areas of "bloat" with
far further reach than this.  Go get a few thousand signatures from actual
Qlogic FC owners running linux oking your destablization of the driver and
I'll leave this alone.  Otherwise, either delete the driver entirely or
put the firmware for which the driver is designed and proven stable by the
test of time back in the tree.
This is the 2.4 "stable" kernel tree.  One would assume people work towards
*increasing* it's stability by fixing its flaws, not wildly deleting shit
and (possibly) randomly breaking things. (But I digress.  I'm treading into
the abyss of source/configuration management of which the kernel tree has
none.)

As I recall, the Qlogic ISP driver has had a similar option for years.
(Maybe not to prevent compilation but certainly to prevent loading it.)

So basically, you had no fucking clue what kind of instability you were about
to introduce into the current "stable" line of kernels, but did it anyway
simply because of the wording (and your interpretation thereof) of the license
on a firmware "data" file.  Wording that has been unchanged since the day
the file was entered into the tree.  If there were objections, questions,
or other concerns, they should have been raised then and not months or years
later.  And there should have been at least some discussion before removing
the file and seeing who notices. (If I missed this discussion, then I
apologize.)
