I certainly hope they move elsewhere; totally removing these is bad news 
for anyone running a server that does disk I/O.
If the bugginess of part of the data is a problem, remove that data for 
the time being. I can also imagine people feel it is bloated (blocks and 
KB/sec), and maybe it should be reorganized to move elsewhere.
But measurement is important - the saying here is "meten is weten" - and 
should not be removed from the kernel.
As for correcting: I can imagine a really dirty fix decrementing the 
number of running requests once a second, on top of the fix in 2.5 that 
prevents the number from going negative. The extra decrement makes disk 
performance appear about 1% higher than it should: not a big falsification.
