The above was built with gcc 3.4.4. With gcc 4.0.2 on the same config:
$ size vmlinux.402.*
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
2626474  461856  479984 3568314  3672ba vmlinux.402.inline
2313578  461800  479984 3255362  31ac42 vmlinux.402.noinline
An 11.9% size reduction in .text. What I also notice is the 4.0.2
appears to inline more aggressively than 3.4.4 because the same
config is almost 50K larger in the inline case when compiled with gcc
3.4.4. the "noinline" cases were built with Arjan's patch and
CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE; the "inline" kernels were built,
obviously, without the patch and without CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE.
