I'm not Ingo but you'll figure it out.
Recursion is unnecessary; the depths are bounded by BITS_PER_LONG
divided by the log of the branch factor and looping over levels
directly suffices.
I started somewhat before the first for_each_task-* patches are
dated on kernel.org, which puts it sometime before May (obviously
I spent time writing & testing before dropping it onto an ftp site).
My original allocator(s) used a radix tree structured bitmap like this
in order to provide hard constant time bounds, but statically-allocated
them. Static allocation didn't fit in with larger pid space, though.
