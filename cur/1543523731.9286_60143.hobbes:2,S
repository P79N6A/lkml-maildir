The LFS standard already deals with this.  The kernel is required to
maintain the "offset maximum" for each fd, and files opened with 32-bit
off_t have an offset maximum of 2G.  Any attempt to write beyond that
point will fail with EFBIG.  Files opened with open64 or with
-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE in effect will not have that limit.
