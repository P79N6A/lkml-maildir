You bring up an interesting point.  If the physical sector
is larger than the data being written how can the drive
reallocate the sector without silently losing data?
To put it in the concrete, if the physical sector were 16K
and we only do a 4K write and there is a unrecoverable read
error on the physical sector as part of the
read-modify-write sequence what is the drive to do?  The
other 12K for which the drive has no data could be other
files not related to the 4K being written or even filesystem
meta-data.  Reallocation in that case would cause silent
corruption.
Perhaps what finally allowed the reallocation was that the
entire physical sector finally accumulated writes to all the
logical sectors needed to be a complete physical sector
write.
