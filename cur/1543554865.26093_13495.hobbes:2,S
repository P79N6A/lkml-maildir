I have been running a plug in for xmms for some time that uses the
aviplay program and avifile library...then when upgrading to test5/6 I
start getting this error message when running xmms:
ERROR: no time-stamp counter found! Quitting.
I finally trace it down to my avi plugin and  then from there to the
actual aviplay program.  I have played with a newer version that had
more specific error messages one of which told me I had a non-intel
compatible x86 with no time-stamp counter and to use ./configure
--disable-tsc to fix  the situation, this is all well and good if the
plugin didn't rely on an older version where even using the config
option will not work, here is my /proc/cpuinfo which shows tsc but
something has got to be wrong with it in recent versions.
