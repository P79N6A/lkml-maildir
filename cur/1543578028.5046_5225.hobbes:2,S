Subject: [patch] 2.4.0: defxx oopses upon insmod if short on memory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
 Is there anyone maintaining defxx these days?
 The defxx driver does a null pointer derefence if a system is short on
memory.  This happens repeatably on a 32MB machine if fsck is run just
befor loading the driver (not an unusual event upon startup and a quite
nasty one).
 The driver should check for a null pointer, obviously and the following
patch does.  Anyway, as the driver allocates quite an amount of memory
chances are it will fail to get it so I decided to call schedule() so that
temporary buffers might get freed.  Otherwise chances are it would never
succeed on a busy system.  It succeeds after ~50 iterations on my system.
 If anyone has a better idea, I would be pleased to hear it.
  Maciej
