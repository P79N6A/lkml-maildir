I'm not sure if its only a sata problem, I saw several of other oopses, one 
was related to Firewire/scsi (ok, could be a consequence of the previous sata 
problem), one came from bluesmoke (external patch) and some of them I 
couldn't associate to anything (but those I couldn't also capture via 
netconsole).

Sure, I will test 2.6.15 this evening. I will also enable most debugging 
information for this testkernel, ok?
Thanks,

PS: For production we unfortunately can't use 2.6.15 - reiserfs trouble (well, 
I could try to revert commit 5fa8ad644faa114c4190484ac50e15236fc7cdd9, but 
I'm still waiting for an offical statement of the reiserfs poeple) and 
Win4Lin patches are available up to 2.6.14 only (its the PC of our secretary 
and she really wouldn't like that ;) ).
