Excellent post, but I can relate to this point the most.  Using the debugger to
aid in understanding the kernel is akin, IMHO, to knowing assembly language
when programming in a high-level language.  People who understand how the
computer works (which is only possible if you know asm) are better programmers
than those who don't.  Similarly, interacting with the kernel while its doing
its "magic" makes it easier to understand that magic.
I lost a lot of respect for Linus when he made comments that basically implied
that I was not worthy of learning the Linux kernel because I did not want to do
it the hard way.
