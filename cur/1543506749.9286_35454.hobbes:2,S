Alternatively, if memory mapped I/O were to be used,
then there is the possibility of using madvise(). 
I've used madvise() pretty successfully to inform the
kernel of expected I/O access patterns on Solaris.  By
using madvise(), you can tell the kernel that you are
doing sequential I/O, so you won't hog the buffer
cache.
Unfortunately, Linux does not currently support
madvise(), though I think FreeBSD does.
I hope that madvise() eventually works its way in to
Linux, too.  I certainly could use it.
