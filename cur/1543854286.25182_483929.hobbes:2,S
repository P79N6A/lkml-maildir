You are right.

That's right.  I was forgetting an important difference between the c[idx]
and the hardluckref paths:  With c[idx] there has to be 2-way
communication (writer increments completed, then reader increments
c[idx]).  With hardluckref there is only 1-way communication (reader
increments hardluckref).  The synchronize_sched call takes care of the
reader->writer message; the memory barrier is needed for the
writer->reader message.  Hence it isn't necessary after the atomic_inc.
But of course it _is_ needed for the fastpath to work.  In fact, it might 
not be good enough, depending on the architecture.  Here's what the 
fastpath ends up looking like (using c[idx] is essentially the same as 
using hardluckref):
	WRITER				READER
	------				------
	dataptr = &(new data)		atomic_inc(&hardluckref)
	mb				mb
	while (hardluckref > 0) ;	access *dataptr
Notice the pattern: Each CPU does store-mb-load.  It is known that on 
some architectures each CPU can end up loading the old value (the value 
from before the other CPU's store).  This would mean the writer would see 
hardluckref == 0 right away and the reader would see the old dataptr.
On architectures where the store-mb-load pattern works, the fastpath would 
be safe.  But on others it would not be.
Heh, Paul, this highlights the usefulness of our long discussion about 
memory barrier semantics.  :-)
