Hello,
I have this CD burner: Vendor: ARTEC Model: WRR-4848,
ide-scsi is loaded and it burns CDs fine, but it can't blank
them.
I do cdrecord -blank=<foo> dev=x,y,z
and i got this in the log, it repeats every second:
Dec 30 16:19:46 koala kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 5233
8, scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 Read (10) 00 00 13 80 dd 00 00 01 00 
Dec 30 16:19:46 koala kernel: SCSI host 0 abort (pid 52338) timed out - resetti
ng
after a while:
Dec 30 16:32:47 koala kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
Dec 30 16:32:48 koala kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 5234
0, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 Test Unit Ready 00 00 00 00 00 
Dec 30 16:32:48 koala kernel: SCSI host 0 abort (pid 52340) timed out - resetti
ng
and after some time it hard freezes, nothing responds, i can't switch numlock
off and i can't change to console (i am in XWindow).
I can reproduce it every time, the kernel is from the kernel-image-2.4.18-686 debian package (sid).
I can provide more informations if you want.
