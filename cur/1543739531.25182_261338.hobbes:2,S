yes, the bug only occurs on a specific file.
as the bug is present in -mm1 (without vp) too, i applied your patch to that 
one. here is the output:
fat_cache_check: id 0, contig 6415, fclus 38231, dclus 1010103
contig 6416, fclus 38231, dclus 1010103
contig 0, fclus 32, dclus 603964
contig 1, fclus 30, dclus 603960
contig 7, fclus 22, dclus 603950
contig 4, fclus 17, dclus 603943
contig 1, fclus 15, dclus 603940
contig 6, fclus 8, dclus 603931
contig 0, fclus 7, dclus 603929
and the movie starts to play in mplayer without problems. tell me if you need 
more debugging!
best regards,
