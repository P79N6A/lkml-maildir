Greetings!
I tried to create a custom kernel with an added system
call, so the goal was to have 2 kernels to choose from
at boot time.
In /usr/src/linux-2.4.28-gentoo-r5, I edited the
Makefile so that "EXTRAVERSION = -gentoo-r5-new", and
recompiled my custom kernel with the following
commands:
make mrproper
make menuconfig
make dep
make bzImage
make modules
make modules-install
make install
Now I have 2 kernels, and when I boot from the
original, I get the following error at boot:
Bringing eth0 up via DHCP... [!!]
ERROR: Problem starting needed services.
"netmount" was not started.
The original kernel I compiled with genkernel.  The
new kernel used the method described above.  Here is
my grub.conf:
default 0
timeout 30
splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
title=Gentoo Linux 2.4.28-r5
root (hd0,0)
kernel /kernel-2.4.28-gentoo-r5 root=/dev/ram0
init=/linuxrc 
ramdisk=8192 real_root=/dev/hda3
initrd /initrd-2.4.28-gentoo-r5
title=Gentoo Linux 2.4.28-r5-new
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.28-gentoo-r5-new root=/dev/hda3
So, did I trash my original kernel?  Was the method I
used to compile a custom kernel incorrect?
Thank you for your help.
Jensen
