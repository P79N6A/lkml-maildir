I think I do, I need to double check. 
The thing is this logic is different in that it uses INTx instead of pins
but otherwise is quite standard for chipsets and their IOAPICs.  I'm not
at all certain this behavior is what the original concern was about.
The description is enough different you may have found a completely
different set of behavior we have to worry about.
Since the legacy/non legacy behavior is common invoked by the ioapic
mask bit working with just about any recent chipset should get a taste
of that.  But I will still try and dig up an E7520 and see what
happens.
