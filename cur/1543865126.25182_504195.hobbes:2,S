Zach,
Do you have any userspace code that can be used to get started experimenting
with your fibril based AIO stuff?
I want to try it on from a userspace perspective.
I'm confident I could hack it up from scratch, but I'm sure you'll have some
test code lying around.
I scanned the discussion so far, but I might've missed any references to
userspace code so far.
Thanks!
