It seems like all these hypertransport magic constants should be in a
general .h somewhere.  I'm not sure if it makes sense to put them in
<linux/pci.h>, or start a <linux/hypertransport.h>.

The logic here is pretty hard to follow, and you're getting squeezed
pretty hard by indenting 5 tabs stops.  Can ipath_setup_ht_config() be
split up into subfunctions?
