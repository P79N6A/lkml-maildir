We would need something like this to flatten hierarchy, so that for
example it is possible to do fair-container scheduling +
fair-user/process scheduling inside a container using a hierarchy depth of 
just 1 (containers) that core scheduler understands. We discussed this a bit at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118054481416140&w=2
 and is very much
on my todo list to experiment with.

Wouldn't it be simpler if admin created these sets as containers
directly? i.e:
uid:          a a a a a b b b b b c c c c c
container:    1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4
That way scheduler will not have to "guess" such intersecting schedulable
sets/groups. It seems much simpler to me this way.
Surely there is some policy which is driving some tasks of userid 
'b' to be in container A and some to be in B. It should be trivial
enough to hook onto that policy making script and create separate
containers like above.
