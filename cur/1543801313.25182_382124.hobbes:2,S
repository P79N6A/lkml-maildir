Yes.  I have
pen-secure  -fstype=ext2,sync,nodev,nosuid,noatime  :/dev/sda2
in /etc/auto.misc.  Removing the sync option does prevent the lockups.
I just added it back and it locked up immediately.
The usb/usb-storage logs are attached (device mount + command which
broke it).  Would you like any more information?
Regards,
Roger
