Subject: fix the softlockup watchdog to actually work
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
this Xen related commit:
   commit 966812dc98e6a7fcdf759cbfa0efab77500a8868
   Author: Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org>
   Date:   Tue May 8 00:28:02 2007 -0700
       Ignore stolen time in the softlockup watchdog
broke the softlockup watchdog to never report any lockups. (!)
print_timestamp defaults to 0, this makes the following condition
always true:
	if (print_timestamp < (touch_timestamp + 1) ||
and we'll in essence never report soft lockups.
apparently the functionality of the soft lockup watchdog was never
actually tested with that patch applied ...
[this is -stable material too.]
