I think thats a bit of a generalisation...
>ASUS P2B-F Board, x86 based desktop system
I have an Asus P2B (i think the ATX form factor version of your P2B-F) and
APM works pretty well here, i recently had an APIC error on resume which
was finally resolved with a patch by Mikael Patterson. So i can vouch for
having a somewhat APM sane Asus board.
