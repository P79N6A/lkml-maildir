Well the next major step here is going direct
pagecache<->BIO, bypassing the intermediate submit_bh
for most I/O.
Probably that will make most of the performance benefits
of delayed-allocate go away.
There are other reasons for implementing delalloc
(XFS, improved layout, ...).  So it ain't dead yet.
At 48 bytes, 2.5's buffer_head is now precisely half the
size of 2.4's.  I'm hoping to be able to shed another eight
bytes yet.
With the pagecache<->BIO change, the buffer_head will most
definitely become "per-page metadata which describes the state
of sub-page segments" and not "something which is used for
performing I/O".
