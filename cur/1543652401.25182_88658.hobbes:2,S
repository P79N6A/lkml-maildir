This interface would help us on s390 very much.  We have a hardware
instruction (INVALIDATE PAGE TABLE ENTRY) that implements the combination 
of 
        pte = ptep_get_and_clear(ptep);
        flush_tlb_page(vma, address);
very efficiently, but we cannot use it to implement flush_tlb_page
alone, because it requires the pte to be valid.
This is why our current in-tree flush_tlb_page is quite inefficient
(it always flushes the complete TLB) ...
If we had a combined hook, we could use our IPTE instruction.
Bye,
Ulrich
