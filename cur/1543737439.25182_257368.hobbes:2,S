Tasks A & B must _not_ be considered members of that exclusive cpuset,
even though it seems that A & B must be attended to by the sched_domain
and memory_domain associated with that cpuset.
The workload managers expect to be able to list the tasks in a cpuset,
so it can hibernate, migrate, kill-off, or wait for the finish of these
tasks.  I've been through this bug before - it was one that cost Hawkes
a long week to debug - I was moving the per-cpu migration threads off
their home CPU because I didn't have a clear way to distinguish tasks
genuinely in a cpuset, from tasks that just happened to be indigenous to
some of the same CPUs.  My essential motivation for adapting a cpuset
implementation that has a task struct pointer to a shared cpuset struct
was to track exactly this relation - which tasks are in which cpuset.
No ... tasks A & B are not allowed in that new exclusive cpuset.
