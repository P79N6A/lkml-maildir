Hi all,
I am a newbie in using UCB1400 chip. Iam using Toradex Colibri module PXA270 as my target system with UCB1400 chip integrated.
I have a problem in enabling the audio system using UCB1400. Can anyone point me, how could I enable and use the UCB1400 driver on linux 2.6.12 platform. I have applied Nicolas Pitre patches and configured kernel CONFIG_INPUT, CONFIG_SND, CONFIG_SOUND,CONFIG_SND_PXA2xx_AC97, CONFIG_SND_PXA2xx_PCM to  =y. The kernel builds well, but on boot the UCB1400 driver didn't gets registered and there are no more interrupts enabled in /proc/interrupts with following boot message,
.....
.....
ts: UCB1x00 touchscreen protocol output
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.9rc2 ( The MAr 24 10:34:34 2005 UTC)
ALSA device list:
  No soundcards found.
....
....
The problem seems to be due to driver_register(pxa2xx-ac97) and bus match.
Any help will be appreciated .
Thanks
Sara
