During boot of 2.2.18 I get the following messages:
mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent variable MTRR settings
mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs
Is this something I should worry about?
This is an MSI 694D Pro AI mainboard, with dual P-III 800EB processors
and 320Mb RAM, stock 2.2.18 kernel.
More info available upon request.
