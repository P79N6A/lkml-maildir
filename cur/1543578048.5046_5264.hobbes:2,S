I think Zlatko's point is that because of the extra allocations, we will
have worse locality (more seeks etc). 
Clearly we should not actually do any more actual IO. But the sticky
allocation _might_ make the IO we do be more spread out.
To offset that, I think the sticky allocation makes us much better able to
handle things like clustering etc more intelligently, which is why I think
it's very much worth it.  But let's not close our eyes to potential
downsides.
