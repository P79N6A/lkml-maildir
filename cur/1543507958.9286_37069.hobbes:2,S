I'd quite like to see an __exit qualifier along the same lines as __init that 
would cause functions so tagged to be thrown away in non-module builds.  At 
the moment you have to either accept memory wastage or surround your cleanup 
code with #ifdef MODULE, as far as I can tell, which isn't especially pretty.
