	Then would it be possible to move them into the /proc system?  Perhaps default
them to what they are now, have that default stable in the make process, then
have that variable be updatable from the /proc system during run time.
	Now that would be slick :)
	After that hot kernel updates would be a nice thing to have.
	Unfortunately I haven't had my OS design class, so I'm just going to have to be
a cheerleader at the moment.
