Subject: 3-Ware Raid driver fails to update GenDisk head

Andre/LKML,
I am still working on this, but would appreciate some help from
whomever owns this driver proper.  I have discovered that the 
3Ware drivers are not updating the gendisk_head with devices
reported and exposed to user space as /dev/sda, sdb, etc.  The 
adapter driver does correctly report devices to user space, but 
is not properly reflecting these devices in the gendisk_head,
which makes it rather hard for kernel level drivers to scan 
and determine which devices are attached to the controller.
I attempted to correct this in the code, but found that these
changes are a very significant effort to get working.  
Please advise.
Jeff
