Nice for one-file throwaway C proggies. But then again, Perl is so much
better at what you'd want to do most of the time...
Look, people, the gcc folks have recently redone the guts of the compiler
to make more advanced optimizations possible/easier (look at the news for
2000-2002 at <
http://gcc.gnu.org
>). It still needs a lot of porting over of
optimizations and developing new ones, plus tuning, AFAIU.
The other open(ish) C compilers I know about are mere toys.
