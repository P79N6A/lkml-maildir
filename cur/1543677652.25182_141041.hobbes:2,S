I should clarify here that I was speaking strictly for my lonesome sorry
self :), and have no knowledge of what the state of the various
RAS projects currently are, and the approaches they are trying..
For all I know, they may be currently trying precisely that..
Janice's patch is the first I've seen in this area (Luckily,
most of the time they keep me in a cave :) :)), and I do
appreciate *something* being done in this area, it seemed a
good start and really, I dont care how its implemented, I'll
leave that to the folks who have spent longer than the
8 mins I currently have on it..

Well, right now, thats all we have, right? Silly strings? But
thats not really my position, which is more like:
Whatever! Whatever! Somebody! Make it so! :) :).

OK, that is a good idea.. :)
