Forgive me if this is a known problem,
I have a Intel Providence Dual PPro MB.  Apparently this board's
design as known SMP bugs in the chipset.  I believe this has
work-around code in the 2.2.x kernels as it runs great on those
kernels.  I just tried 2.3.20 and found that I got lots of "spurious
interrupt ... this should never happen" messages before it hung.  I
tried the kernel again in non-SMP mode and it works great.  This is
just a friendly reminder and a bit of a begging that I hope I'll be
able to run 2.4.x in SMP mode with this somewhat broken SMP chipset.
I'm hoping for a response like: "Oh yeah and here's the patch it will
be in 2.3.21." :)  I'm also more than happy to test any experimental
fixes.
I'm not subscribed to this list so please "cc:" me as well as the
list.
	Thanks,
	Rick Niles.
