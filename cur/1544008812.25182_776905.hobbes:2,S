SI_ASYNCIO currently qualifies as user signal, it is sent in the context
of the pid issuing the async io request. It is never used as a kernel
originated signal in any way. The code sending it even seems to do a
full permission check.
If you think this is wrong, maybe this should be fixed first.

If it have a sender pid attached, this should be checked.

No, I meant a real comment, defining the complete behaviour, each
parameter with constraints and the possible return values.
