I may have discovered a problem with with ppp or ip masquerading.  The
symptom is this:
For days I was attempting to go to a 
http://www.iomega.com
 from a machine
behind an ip masquerading firewall running kernel 2.2.2.  DNS would
resolve, and the browsers would wait indefinitely for a response.
However, I could reach the site using lynx from the firewall.
My ppp mru/mtu was set to 512 for performance reasons.  I wondered if this
might be the problem, and allowed pppd to use 1524 which is what my ISP
wants to negotiate.  The browser on the private network address was now
able to contact the site.
Might this be a kernel or ipchains problem?
