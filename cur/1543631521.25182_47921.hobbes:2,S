Subject: [PATCH] SUSv2 msgctl compliance
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

For msgctl SUSv2 states:
"IPC_SET can only be executed by a process with appropriate privileges
or that has an effective user ID equal to the value of msg_perm.cuid
or msg_perm.uid in the msqid_ds data structure associated with
msqid. Only a process with appropriate privileges can raise the value
of msg_qbytes."
The current linux behaviour is to allow for the value of msg_qbytes to
be raised even if the process is not privileged. The following
patch (against 2.4.19pre8) fixes this problem:
