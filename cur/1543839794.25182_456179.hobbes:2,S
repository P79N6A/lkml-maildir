Does the following seem a reasonable way to handle secureexec in the
face of file caps?
Seems like it should work so long as we don't have to worry about the
bprm changing partway through exec.  This should avoid the need to store
the old capabilities.
Unless I've got my head screwed on completely backward...

(note - Still need at least a signals patch on top of this before the
file caps could be safe for use)

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] security: handle secureexec with filesystem capabilities
A secure exec is required if euid!=uid, and, correspondingly,
if the executable's file capability set was not empty and the
process is not owned by (real uid) root.
