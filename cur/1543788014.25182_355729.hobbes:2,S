Hi all,
I am equally interested to see how all this will affect embedded world.
While processors will have to go parallel, I agree, there will be more
then one processor (may be uniprocessor) embedded in devices like
cellphone, MP3 player etc. against one on our desk and in server
rooms. Linux has to work on this devices too.
