But the host sets SActive only, the device clears it. And at least the
maxtor drives don't clear SActive on non-NCQ commands, which makes
things really confusing once you have completed a non-NCQ command and
start doing some NCQ ones. Page 59 of the AHCI 1.1 spec reads:
4. If it is a queued command, software shall first set
PxSACT.DS(pFreeSlot). [...]
So I really do think this is an error in ahci.c since the beginning.

Perhaps you could include such a patch in libata-dev for a while, if you
wish? I really cannot remove it from the NCQ patch.
