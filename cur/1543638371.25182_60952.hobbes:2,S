Hi all,
I have a IGEL Etherminal C Thin Client (that's a "real" computer with 
a Cyrix Media GX CPU, and nearly everything you need on board: LAN, 
ser, par and VGA).
With Linux 2.2.xxx there are no problems, but with Kernels 2.4.xx 
scrolling doesn't work :-((((
If the kernel boots the screen is filled up with kernel-messages. If 
it reached the last line, the screen isn't scrolled up (but booting 
continues - if Linux is up I can telnet to this box).....
Any ideas? How can I help to find the bug (ehem, if it is one)....
Thanks
  Michael
