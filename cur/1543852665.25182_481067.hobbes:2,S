They are very very few.  The ones I recall are kudzu, radvd, and
libpthreads (which doesn't care).  
There is a thread a month or so ago about this where I did a request
for testers, that listed all of the users we could find.
The reality is that I don't think kernel developers can seriously find
them.
If someone actually wants to kill sys_sysctl more power to them.  As
long as we don't add more binary numbers I think it is actually easier
to support it than to find those weird users and remove it.
