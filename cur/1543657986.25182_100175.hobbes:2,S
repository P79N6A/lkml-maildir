Hi,
The toplevel Makefile in 2.5.54 has near line 313:
----------------------------
#	set -e makes the rule exit immediately on error
#...
attribute if uninitialized.
define rule_vmlinux__
	set -e
...
endef
-------------------------
However, the "set -e" does nothing since each line is
processed by a different shell according to the make
manual.
