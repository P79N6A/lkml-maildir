Is it?  I am a bit concerned about the non-monotonic distribution.
Difference starts a near-0, grows to 4.4, drops to near-0, grows to 4.9,
drops to near-0.
Order   Flat    Sparse  % diff
0       639     641     0.3
1       567     593     4.4
2       679     692     1.9
3       763     781     2.3
4       961     962     0.1
5       1356    1392    2.6
6       2224    2336    4.8
7       4869    5074    4.0
8       12500   12732   1.8
9       27926   28165   0.8
10      58578   58682   0.2
Is there an explanation for this behaviour?  More to the point, could
repeated runs also return 4% difference for order-0?
