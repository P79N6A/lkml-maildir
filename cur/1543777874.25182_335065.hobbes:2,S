Dimitry,
I have been receiving a lot of complaints that TrackPoints on
Synaptics pass-thru ports stopped working with 2.6.12. I retested
2.6.9 and 2.6.11-rc3 successfully, I believe 2.6.11.7 may also work
but that is unconfirmed at this point.
The behavior is always the same .. after sending the read secondary ID
command, the TrackPoint seems to be disabled from that point forward.
Any ideas?
