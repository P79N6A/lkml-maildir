Hmm. It appears that some of the processes are stuck on this
part of page_launder:
                        /*
                         * Re-take the spinlock. Note that we cannot
                         * unlock the page yet since we're still
                         * accessing the page_struct here...
                         */
                        spin_lock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
It will be interesting to see what's going on in each of the cpus.
Use "cpu x" x=0,1,2,3 on your 4 cpu system to switch to cpu x,
and just type "bt" on each cpu. Also, it will be good to see what
kswapd (pid 2) is upto ...
