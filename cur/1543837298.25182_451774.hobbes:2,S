No.  It can be copied before the assembly gets called, because we are in the
kernel at that time which certainly is not in the highmem. :-)

No, they can't, but that just isn't necessary.  During the resume we create
two lists of PBEs - one for "normal" pages, and one for highmem pages.  The
first one is handled by the "atomic copy" code as usual, but the second one
may be handled by some C code a bit earlier.
