The 2.6 kernel, as of 2.6.0-test10 iirc, should work ok.  Recent kernels 
contain an 'sn2_defconfig' file that you can use to build a usable kernel:
  # tar zxf linux-2.6.6.tar.gz
  # cd linux-2.6.6
  # make sn2_defconfig
  # make -j<some high number> compressed
  # boot your kernel
But don't forget that you need to pass 'console=ttyS0' on your kernel boot 
line (it's easiest to add this to your elilo.conf file).

Yep, linux-ia64@vger.kernel.org

Is this with the sn2_defconfig file?  What PROM are you running?

Stock (i.e. non-SGI or non-SuSE) 2.4 kernels won't work on Altix.  You need 
2.6.

It should work fine.  And linux-ia64 is probably a better list (more chance of 
me seeing your message).
