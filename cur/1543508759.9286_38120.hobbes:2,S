IMHO when the chksum become a big bottleneck for performances you
should have the cache hot. I think it worth to optimize the bottleneck
case.
Anyway I am not very concerned about such minor performance improvement so
if you want to drop the performance part of the patch (the copy-and-chksum
one) I don't care at _all_. I only would like to have the known and
documented bug fixed.
