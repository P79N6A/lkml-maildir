Nick, I just realized: would it be possible to have a pgprot_t argument 
to this one, instead of it using vma->vm_pgprot?
The motivation for this (DRM again) is that some architectures (powerpc) 
cannot map the AGP aperture through IO space, but needs to remap the 
page from memory with a nocache attribute set. Others need special 
pgprot settings for write-combined mappings.
Now, there's a possibility to change vma->vm_pgprot during the first 
->fault(), but again, we only have the mmap_sem in read mode.
