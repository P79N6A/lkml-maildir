this is a tough problem that wont go away.
Even platforms where the per-CPU clock is supposed to be synchronized,
sometimes it isnt. (this is a recurring problem on x86 SMP - so x86 will
benefit from it too.)
the relaxation means the effective granularity reduction of the
migration decisions - but this is not a problem, migration latencies are
always a high multiple of the timer irq frequency. The cycle accuracy of
sched_clock() is otherwise very important for correct interactivity
decisions - but this is only used locally and is thus preserved by the
patch. The only area where this change can reduce the quality of
interactivity estimatio is when a task oscillates very quickly between
multiple CPUs and is also somehow relevant to interactivity.
So i believe the generic relaxing of sched_clock() synchronization is
the right thing to do. I like your patch. It adds minimal overhead and
solves a hard problem - nice work! Andrew, please apply it.
