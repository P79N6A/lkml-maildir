Can you printk the pointers (arg and uifr) as well? Maybe the end up
unaligned or otherwise corrupted for some reason.
Does the same thing happen when you try the ioctl on something that
is not even a socket? E.g.
#include <whatever you need...>
int main(void)
{
	struct ifreq ifr = {};
	ioctl(0 /* standard input! */, SIOCGIFNAME, &ifr);
	perror("ioctl");
}
