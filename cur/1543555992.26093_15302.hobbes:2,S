   BTW, all local services (smtp, telnet etc) work well.  Any ideas?
No ideas, and since the indicated programs from lmbench work
perfectly fine here on my machines, you're going to have to do some
detective work so we can figure out whats wrong.
You need to do some strace'ing of the affected programs and try
to figure out exactly how they get stuck and for what reason.
