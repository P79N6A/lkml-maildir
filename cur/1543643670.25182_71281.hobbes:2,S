I applied that patch to 2.5.35-bk3 and with PREEMPT enabled.  And it
booted without any of the usual complaints with preempt and the
in_atomic check.  But then, I ran
1) dbench 1 OK
2) dbench 2 OK
3) dbench 3 blam!  
Running dbench 3 resulted in the dbench clients hanging and being
unkillable with kill -9 in the D state.

I can ssh and enter my user password, but it hangs after that with
no bash prompt.  Other ssh sessions which I started previously are still
responsive.
Test box is 2-way pIII, kernel SMP.
