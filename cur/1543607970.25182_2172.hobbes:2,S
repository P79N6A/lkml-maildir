PROBLEM: Linux updates RTC secretly when clock synchronizes.
Please CC replies etc to Ian Maclaine-cross <iml@debian.org>.
When /usr/sbin/ntpd synchronizes the Linux kernel (or system) clock
using the Network Time Protocol the kernel time is accurate to a few
milliseconds. Linux then sets the Real Time (or Hardware or CMOS)
Clock to this time at approximately 11 minute intervals. Typical RTCs
drift less than 10 s/day so rebooting causes only millisecond errors.
Linux currently does not record the 11 minute updates to a log file.
Clock programs (like hwclock) cannot correct RTC drift at boot without
knowing when the RTC was last set. If NTP service is available after a
long shutdown, ntpd may step the time.  Worse after a longer shutdown
ntpd may drop out or even synchronize to the wrong time zone.  The
workarounds are clumsy.
Please find following my small patch for linux/arch/i386/kernel/time.c
which adds a KERN_NOTICE of each 11 minute update to the RTC. This is
just for i386 machines at present. A script can search the logs for
the last set time of the RTC and update /etc/adjtime.  Hwclock can
then correct the RTC for drift and set the kernel clock.
I patched Linux 2.2.19 and 2.4.12 then compiled, installed and
rebooted on Pentium MMX and AMD K6-III machines respectively. When the
kernel clock synchronized "...: Real Time Clock set at xxx s" appeared
in the kernel log every 661 s where "xxx" was the current system
time. Messages ceased whenever the clock was unsynchronized.  Ntpd
produces typically four log lines in 661 s so the increase in log
volume is small for ntpd users and nothing for nonusers. The patch
added 11 bytes to the size of my compressed kernel.
