I'm not doing any prefetches in the code (if that is what you are
talking about).  The code just moves the pipe reader to the same
CPU as the pipe writer (which is about to block).  Certainly, the
pipe reader could take advantage of any data written by the writer
still being in the cache.
The code added to 'try_to_wake_up' looks something like this:
        if (unlikely(synchronous)){
                rq = lock_task_rq(p, &flags);
                if (p->array || p->state == TASK_RUNNING) {
			/* We're too late */
                        unlock_task_rq(rq, &flags);
                        return success;
                }
                p->cpu = smp_processor_id(); /* Change CPU id */
                unlock_task_rq(rq, &flags);
                rq = lock_task_rq(p, &flags);
                p->state = TASK_RUNNING;
                if (!p->array) {
                        activate_task(p, rq);
                }
                unlock_task_rq(rq, &flags);
		return success;
	}
I'm not sure if 'synchronous' is still being passed all the way
down to try_to_wake_up in your tree (since it was removed in 2.5).
This is based off a back port of O(1) to 2.4.18 that Robert Love
did.  The rest of try_to_wake_up (the normal/common path) remains
the same.
