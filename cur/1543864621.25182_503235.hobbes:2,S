Why XOR? To pretend a non-existent level of security?
Either you can't use the address, or you can read the obfusicator value, too.
OTOH, if sizeof(void*) <= sieof(ino_t), using the address will result in a
unique inode number without need for expensive hashing algorithms.

The difference is small, but important.
