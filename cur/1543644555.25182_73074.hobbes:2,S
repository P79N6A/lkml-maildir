Not very much.  We have been thinking about this for a while already.
The microsecond-resolution times would be stored in a "large inode"
or in an extended attribute if the inode is a regular-sized one.  The
latter would be a pretty big performance hit for most applications if
it were only the u-second data that were being stored in the EA space.
We are also looking at a better method of storing the EA data so that
it is more efficient than the current EA implementation, but that is
mostly tangential to your concerns.
Cheers, Andreas
