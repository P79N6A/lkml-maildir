I'd like to be able to write shell scrips that operate on the set of
/proc/[0-9]* without having to know which of the ever-changing list
of processes need to be avoided and which not.
And it's not really root.  It's a SYS_CAP_NICE capability.  All
realtime apps or their admins will have that capability as a matter
of course in their normal daily operations.
