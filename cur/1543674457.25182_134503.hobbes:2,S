The only thing that matters is how much you sleep vs run, so yes, it should 
have a higher priority unless that handling is heavy on cpu.  If it 
doesn't, then you have to have a different problem, because the dynamic 
priority portion of the scheduler is dead simple.  The only way I can 
imagine that priority could end up lower than expected is heavyweight 
interrupt load, or spinning out of control.

I just saw your other post regarding the web page.  Now that I know that 
there's a detailed description in there somewhere, I'll go read it and see 
if any of what I've gleaned from crawling around the scheduler code is 
useful.  I thought you might be encountering the same kind of generic 
starvation I've seen.  Ergo, the simple diag patch.
