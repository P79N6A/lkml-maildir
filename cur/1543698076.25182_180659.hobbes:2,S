I mailx the patch to my email and then cut and paste it from one message 
to another.  Since it's the same program it keeps the same formatting 
(it marks it as fixed width).   I just saved that message to a file and 
it's formatted properly.   It even looks ok when using "View Message 
Source".   I sent the patch back to my test box and it's a 100% match to 
the original.  Looks like the merged lines were a display bug in 
Thunderbird...
