I have a Radeon 9600 Mobility in my laptop and it boots into KDE on SuSE 
9.0 x86_64.
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=y
CONFIG_FB_RADEON=m
CONFIG_FB_RADEON_DEBUG=y
CONFIG_AGP_AMD64=y
I still see failed messages in starting services which is some race 
condition I've not yet fathomed, but the services are all running. Up on 
2.6.5-mm4.
Regards
Sid.
