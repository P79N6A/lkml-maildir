	thanks, i just tested the "notsc" option (.config has CONFIG_X86_TSC
enabled=y, but CONFIG_M586TSC is not enabled.. if that's ok), but this time
I booted and kept the machine on battery power the ENTIRE time, i had not
tried this before.  the MHZ value Detected in time.c is 132Mhz (down from
500Mhz if not on battery power).  but the interesting thing that i just
noticed is that the mdelay() wait time, is STILL about 25% of what it should
delay.  i use 10000 (for a 10 second delay) and get only about 2-3 seconds
out of it.  this smaller delay occurs with or without "notsc" on the boot
line.  now, i did not expect this behaviour if i did not plug in to get more
CPU speed, with the calculated cpu rate when on battery power.  i expected
that mdelay() would function properly with the appropriate wait time if i
booted and stayed on battery power, at the same reduced CPU frequency.
Alan, you might have answered this in your first post but i don't under the
INTEL speedstep logic to understand if this is expected behaviour.  but the
bottom line is that my delay of 700 milleseconds in the driver fails if i
boot and stay on battery power exclusively.  did anyone else expect this
behaviour?
