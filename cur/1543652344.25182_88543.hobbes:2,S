Thanks for this hint. So this means kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) inside
spinlock is not necessarily dangerous, but should be avoided if
possible? Is using a semaphore better than using spinlocks? Is
there a list of dos and don'ts for preempt kernels beside
Documentation/preempt-locking.txt?
And btw, who is "us"?
Regards, Olaf.
