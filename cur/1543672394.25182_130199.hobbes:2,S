Burning audio cd's too, right?
I've noticed that burnfree gets triggered quite often while burning audio
cd's on my LiteOn LTR-48125W at 40x(maximum my cds will let me do).
Actually, speaking of that, I'm using burnfree under cdrecord 2.01a10.
Once in awhile I'll burn a cd and the red light turns to orange, indicating
burnproof has triggered on the drive.
Yet, at the end of the burn using -v, cdrecord will claim burnfree was
never needed even though it has triggered dozens of times.
Very weird.
Mike
