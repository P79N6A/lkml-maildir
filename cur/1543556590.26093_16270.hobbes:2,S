Ditto, we have an adsl driver that we setup by overloading various otherwise
unused options in ifconfig (mem_start, io_addr etc) to do this. Cheaper and
faster than writing yet another ioctl using device configuration agent, but
distasteful non the less.
Some generic way to pass configuration data using a generic configuration
agent to network (and other) drivers would be interesting.
