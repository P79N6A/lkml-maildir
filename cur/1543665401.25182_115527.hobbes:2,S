I know it's late, sorry.
But a lot of code that will need klibc, has not been converted to need
it yet, due to it not being there :)
If we add klibc to the build process, then those early boot processes
(like network boot, mounting of the root fs, acpi userspace parsers,
etc.) can later be added.  Without it, the whole initramfs code is
pretty worthless right now.  I purposely made these changesets up to
show how to use klibc, but not move any required functions over to it.
If you want to wait, and have me work on moving some of the existing
kernel code to userspace, using klibc, to prove it is needed in the
tree, I will be glad to do that.  But in talking previously, I thought
the goal was to provide the functionality so that people can slowly move
those functions out of kernelspace, over time.
thanks,
