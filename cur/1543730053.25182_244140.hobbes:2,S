I remember a computer from pre ibm-pc days. It came with a manual that 
included a detailed circuit diagram, so the user could make any repairs 
they wished. It also gave details regarding CPU instruction set, and 
memory layout, so that anyone could write any OS they liked for it.
If we do create a nice long list, we should also include Linux 
compatible hardware as well.
E.g. Latest XYZ laptop, it would list all the chips in the laptop, 
together with what level of support linux has for each one.
The problem comes with actually identifying the parts.
For example, Creative have lots of different sound cards, all called the 
  SB Live, but they all have very different chips in them, with some 
supported by linux, and some not. Don't you just love those Marketing 
people. :-(
We can use PCI IDs and PCI subsystem IDs, to identify Motherboards, and 
PCI cards. We might also have to identify revision numbers.
We can use USB IDs to identify USB devices.
As an aid to this, I think we should create a script, that will gather 
the IDs in a consistent way, so that a user just runs the script, adds a 
comment, and submits it to the database.
