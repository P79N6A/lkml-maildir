I see that this patch has not been pulled in yet.  I am wondering if I
confused things by sending it to both linux-kernel and linux-ia64 lists
and each expected the other to pull it in?  Sorry if that breaks the
process, I am somewhat new to submitting patches.
Can we see about getting this in?  It will break the build used by
fedora/RHEL for certain and I expect other distro's as well.
thanks,
