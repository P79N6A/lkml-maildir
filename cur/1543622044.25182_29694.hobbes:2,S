	My patch is also available at :

	Well... I disagree. My patches has advantage over Ian's patch :
		o autoset baud_base/CPR (Ian's patch doesn't)
		o allow to set custom MSR (Ian's patch doesn't)
		o much simpler. My code is readable, has minimal
impact on the general path (non 16C950) and doesn't have ugly gotos
all over the place.
	To claim that Ian's patch is the best, you would need to at
least fix 1 and 2. Number 3 is debatable.
	Regards,
	Jean
