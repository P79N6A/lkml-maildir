not saying your patch is not useful or anything,but there is a less
invasive shortcut possible. Oracle wants to mlock() its shared area, and
for mlock()'d pages we don't need a pte chain *at all*. So we could get
rid of a lot of this overhead that way.
Now your patch might well be useful for a lot of other reasons too, but
if this is the only one there are potential less invasive solutions for
2.6.
