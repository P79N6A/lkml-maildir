I don't think this is correct. I can DOS-boot the Elan SC400 development
board and, using DEBUG, inp from port 0xEF with no effect. Further, the
value read is 0xFF, so it's likely it's not even decoded. 
You might have something plugged into an ISA slot that's screwing up
the timing so badly that I/O at many aliases will reboot. Linux
uses port 0x80 for "slow down I/O". Other ports are specific for the
various devices.
