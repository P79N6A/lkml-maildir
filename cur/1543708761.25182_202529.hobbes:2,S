runqueue locking is done in ascending order when you want to lock multiple
runqueues, i.e. you have to lock cpu_rq(0) before cpu_rq(1). There are
functions to aid in doing double lock acquisitions, namely
double_rq_lock() which does all the work for you.

If you're going to be walking the task list and modifying then you just
need to write_lock the tasklist_lock. Some operations may require you to
lock the task's runqueue, in which case the runqueue lock must be done
within the tasklist_lock.

local_irq_save() is for when you don't know the interrupt enable status
and would like to restore it upon exit of the given per cpu critical
section. local_irq_disable() is normally paired with a local_irq_enable() so it
unconditionally enables interrupts, something you may not always want to
do. If unsure, local_irq_save() is always the safe bet. You may also find
