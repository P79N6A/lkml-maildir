There's also a limit where statfs() overflows at 16TB for 4kB block
filesystems...  Ask me how I noticed this ;-)
Luckily, it is easy to upshift f_blksz and downshift f_blocks, f_bfree,
and f_bavail to get the data through the statfs interface, and df does
the reverse on the other side.  It makes sense to show a larger block
size anyways, so apps potentially do larger I/O requests.
Cheers, Andreas
