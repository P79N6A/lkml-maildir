I'm with Mark on this one. For example if I have two core machine I do not need cpusets
to manage them.
Plus like I explained in prev email cpuset is higher level API. We can think of a way to
integrated them if needed.

Please give me an example of what you have in mind.
Also if you look at the patch (which I've now posted properly) it's not just not starting them.
I also redirected all future scheduled work to non-isolated CPU. ie If work is scheduled on the
isolated CPU this work is treated as if the work queue is single threaded. As I explained before
most subsystem do not care which CPU actually gets to execute the work. Oprofile is the only
one I know of that breaks because it cannot collect the stats from the isolated CPUs. I'm thinking
of a different solution for oprofile, maybe collection samples through IPIs or something.
