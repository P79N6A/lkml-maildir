Subject: PATCH: tioccons() br0ken in 2.2 and 2.3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In 2.2.x and 2.3.x the tioccons() function in tty_io.c tests if you
are using it on the real console, which means that the console redirection
should be turned off.
However it doesn't work since
1. the test is wrong; the wrong tty->driver.type is tested, and
   tty->driver.subtype should be tested as well
2. it won't work anyway as those fields don't come from the new /dev/console
   device but from the actual device behind it (/dev/tty1 or /dev/ttyS0)
So a better way is to test inode->i_rdev to check for /dev/console,
just like it's done in tty_write()
Patch against 2.3.15 follows, also applies against 2.2.12 (should go
into 2.2.13 as well I think)
