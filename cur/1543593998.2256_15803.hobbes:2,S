I totally agree on one point.  Having the automatic initialisers in the
same source as the related code is a good idea, it is far better than
the old Space.c method.  Automatically executing the initialisers in
the order they are linked into vmlinux is also a good idea, you must
have some automatic order or you are back to the horrors of Space.c.
But controlling the link order of the initialisers as a side effect of
Makefile compile order sucks big rocks, especially when you have some
Makefiles executing other Makefiles which are not their children.
Link order should be independent of Makefile compile order and it
should be explicitly specified, instead of occurring as a little known
side effect of the convoluted and twisted way that the Makefile tree is
processed.  Alas Linus likes it this way :(.  At least with my 2.5
Makefile rewrite[*] it is more obvious what is going on.  I abhore the
line order dependencies and controling link order at the level of
entire directories when it should be at the level of individual
sources.

DaveM suggested a drivers/net/s390, I recommended against changing the
diretory structure right now, wait for 2.5.  My patch just changes the
compilation order for drivers/s390/net while keeping the same name.
[*] Extract from top level Makefile in my 2.5 rewrite.
