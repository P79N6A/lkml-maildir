Ack. However, the situation dirty_nodes == NULL && inode dirty then means 
that unknown nodes are dirty. If we are later are successful with the 
alloc and we know that the pages are dirty in the mapping then the initial 
dirty_nodes must be all ones. If this is the first page to be dirtied then 
we can start with a dirty_nodes mask of all zeros like now.
