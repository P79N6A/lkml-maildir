Subject: [PATCH] [3/3] PCI segment support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I'm putting this patch out for comments rather than merging, since I'm
aware that it won't apply to Linus' tree any more.
 - Add segment to pci_bus.
 - Change the sysfs name of each device to include a 16-bit segment ID.
