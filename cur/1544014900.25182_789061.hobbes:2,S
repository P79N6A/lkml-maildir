Subject: [PATCH 0/2] cpumask fallout: Initialize irq_default_affinity earlier et al.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As I said in 2/2:
    Move the initialization of irq_default_affinity to early_irq_init
    as core_initcall is too late.
    irq_default_affinity can be used in init_IRQ and potentially timer
    and SMP init as well.  All of these happen before core_initcall.
    Moving the initialization to early_irq_init ensures that it is
    initialized before it is used.
Mike Travis pointed out that irq_default_affinity depends on
CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS in addition to CONFIG_SMP.  So to make things
consistent, I added 1/2 so that the irq_*_affinity functions and
irq_default_affinity are defined for the same conditions that they are
declared.
I Took Linus' suggestion to move init_irq_default_affinity over to
kernel/irq/handle.c, however due to the way that cpumask_*() are
defined, it is still necessary to have the ugly ifdefs, but now they
are localized to init_irq_default_affinity.
Mike Travis also suggested that alloc_bootmem_cpumask_var() be used in
preference to alloc_cpumask_var, so I incorporated that suggestion as
well.
I tested both with and without CONFIG_SMP, on mips/cavium_octeon, Mike
tested a similar(but not identical patch) on x86_64.
I will reply with the two patches.
David Daney (2):
  Make irq_*_affinity depend on CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS too.
  cpumask fallout: Initialize irq_default_affinity earlier (v2).
