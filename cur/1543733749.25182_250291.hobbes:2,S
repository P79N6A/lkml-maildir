Hi folks,
Has anyone managed to get a 3ware 9500-series RAID controller working
stably on an SMP Opteron system?  Especially with a Tyan 2885 MB?  If
so, would you be willing to share your kernel configuration info?
I'm trying to get a 3ware 9500 8-port card working on a Tyan 2885
motherboard (dual Opterons) and have been experiencing numerous oopses:
  - 2.6.[78] w/ the included 3w-9xxx driver and ext3 FS:
    Results in kernel oops after 1--2 hours of writing to the 
    RAID array (happened four times).  The oops appears to be 
    in ext3.
  - 2.6.8.1 w/ latest 3w-9xxx driver from 3ware and XFS FS:
    Results in "Bad page state at prep_new_page" kernel errors
When not using the 3ware RAID array (that is, the array is mounted but
no reads or writes are done to it), the machine is very stable--even
under heavy CPU loads and lots of IO to local (non-RAID) IDE drives.
Any help/suggestions appreciated!
Ed
