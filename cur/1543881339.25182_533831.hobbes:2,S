Hi!
Some time ago I have written hwmon driver for Centaur C7 
processors. Nobody was interested in testing it, so it 
spend long time on my harddisk. Recently one person wanted 
to test it with 2.6.21-rc7. Unfortunatly compile fails. 
I don't understand why. I'm not using rdmsr_on_cpu 
functions. Code is assuming that only one CPU is present 
and using rdmsr function direcly. Is this no longer 
possible? Do I have to #include something? Build log attached. 
I'm not attaching code because error isn't reported in my 
source file, but in Linux includes. My compiler is GCC 4.1.2 
and kernel isn't SMP.
Please CC me.
Thanks
Rafał
