Guess GPL maniacs would have been happy, should avifile/MPlayer/xine never
supported loading Win32 video+audio codecs. These players are probably
considered non-GPL by Linus. Fine. Way to go, kernel developers.
Maybe you people should instead test release kernels at least with NFS before
releasing. It's kinda basic feature, ya know.
Anyway, GPL only forbids _distribution_ of GPL+binary stuff, not the
_possibility_ to use it. Time for Linus and Greg to come to their
senses.
