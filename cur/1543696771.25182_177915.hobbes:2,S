cvsup does something clever.
For non-CVS repositories, it uses the "rsync" algorithm.
For CVS repositories, it will do per-change updates.
I'm not sure what it does if a change disappears from the source
(haven't tried that yet), but I do know that if you are careful enough
to avoid creating conflicting revision numbers in the mirror, you can
*commit* to it as well.
I'm using cvsup for mirroring a CVS repository at work, and it's worked
very well (and is remarkably low load).
I believe the "mirror consistency" problem isn't solved by this
unfortunately, but considering that there are mirrors not using rsync, I
have a feeling that it's not truly solvable, entirely.
I think I can provide an example set of configuration files for cvsup
now that I've configured it 3 times, if anyone is interested.
