Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.21-pre4 seq_read() fix backport

Al Viro fixed a bug in seq_read for 2.5.31, still needs to be
backported to 2.4.x.  Allows uninitialized data to be read, I think.
You can observe this by adding many (75+, I think) lvm volumes
and do a cat of "/proc/partitions" with slab debugging turned on.
