I've heard there's a freeze of 2.3 coming up, so I thought I'd mention
the Unicode console patch which I originally did for 2.1.132.
It lets you copy and paste in UTF-8 and between consoles with different
ACMs. Further explanations here:

By the way, I suspect this bug in drivers/video/fbcon.c is still
uncorrected in 2.2.12:

Perhaps I'm the only person who ever tried using 512-character fonts on
a frame-buffer console ...
