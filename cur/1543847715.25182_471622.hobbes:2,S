(CC netdev since it's a network driver topic).
all our macro's (e100, e1000, ixgb) use adapter->netdev->name inserted through the 
DPRINTK macro.
if you'd really want to clean it all up, you'd have to replace all DPRINTK() calls with 
dev_dbg(adapter->netdev->name, ....) which would just make it more lengthy and 
uncomfortable to read.
which puts this in a bigger perspective. I suppose the nicest way to do program these is 
to do something like this:
#define ixgb_dbg(args...) dev_dbg(adapter->netdev->name, args)
#define ixgb_err(args...) dev_err(adapter->netdev->name, args)
#define ixgb_info(args...) dev_info(adapter->netdev->name, args)
and use those consistently throughout the driver, ditto for e100/e1000.
I'll look into it and see what I can do.
Cheers,
Auke
