Hi,
You asked:

user processes are just that - user processes, i.e. created by userspace
program doing fork(2) (or clone) system call. If you want to create a
kernel helper thread use kernel_thread() function.
Have a look at fs/buffer.c or mm/vmscan.c which have examples of creating
kernel threads using kernel_thread().
