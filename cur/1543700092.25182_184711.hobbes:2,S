Hello,
Please provide some more insight.
Suppose a filesystem issues a write command to the disk with around 10 4K 
Blocks  to be written. SCSI device point of view i don't get what is the 
parallel I/O.
It has only 1 write command. If some other sends a write request it needs to 
be queued. But the next question arises how the write data would be handled. 
Does it mean the SCSI does not give a response for the block of data written. 
In otherwords does it mean that the response would be given after all the 
block of data is written for a single write request.
Thanks
Jay
