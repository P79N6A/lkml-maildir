Well, here's the problem.  alloc_bootmem will return something
SMP_CACHE_BYTES aligned, so we can't meet this.  If we knew in advance
what the alignment requirements were, we could do so.
Note also, that archs currently use vmalloc() or variants for
module_alloc, but they could easily use kmalloc() for small sizes.  This
would make your life painful, since kmalloc() also returns L1
cache-aligned memory.
I'd suggest that for a 486 configuration, GCC shouldn't be asking for
32-byte alignment for anything.  Still, we probably have to remove the
BUG_ON and simply accept that alignment > SMP_CACHE_BYTES is actually
taking pot luck (depends if the original allocation was aligned).
