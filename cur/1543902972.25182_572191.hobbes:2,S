Ok, I thought twice about this, but 
 (a) I think most of the merging for 2.6.23 has been done
 (b) there's really no point in holding on to that thing
 (c) the patch looked beatiful in colorized version in gitk
so I decided I might as well just merge it. Looks fine to me, and there 
really is no point holding on to an interface that we've never really 
used, and that we don't even support any more.
