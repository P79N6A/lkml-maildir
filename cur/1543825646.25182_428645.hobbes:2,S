Yup.  And it also helps reduce the command-to-command latencies.
I'm all for it, and have implemented tagged queuing for a variety
of device drivers over the past five years (TCQ & NCQ).  In every
case people say.. wow, I expected more of a difference than that,
while still noting the end result was faster under Linux than MS$.
Of course with artificial benchmarks, and the right firmware in
the right drives, it's easier to create and see a difference.
But I'm talking more life-like loads than just a multi-threaded
random seek generator.
Cheers
