There is a loop but its broken by
			p = l3->slabs_free.next;
                        if (p == &(l3->slabs_free))
                                break;
One cache_reap() may scan the free list but once its free the code is 
skipped.
There are potentially large amounts of other caches around that are also 
basically static and which also would need any bypass that we may 
implement.
