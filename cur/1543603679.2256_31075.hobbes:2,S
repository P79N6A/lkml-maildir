[patch snipped]
I have a Tyan K7 Thunder and I have tried this patch
and the patch from Andre, synced with 2.4.10 by Jacob
Luna and have had the same problem with both.  Without
the patch I can only do UDMA33 but the hw supports
UDMA100.  I have a Quantum FireballPlus AS40 on my
primary IDE channel which I have tested on an MSI
K7Master and works fine in UDMA100.
When I reboot with the driver enabled, as soon as hda
is detected the kernel locks up with a DIVIDE (0)
error.  I will try it again and take notes of more
details if it helps.
Without the driver, using the generic code I am able
to use the drive, in I think UDMA100 by letting the
BIOS set the drive to UDMA100 then manually setting
DMA mode on with hdparm.  However if I try to set the
modes manually with hdparm I can not select above
UDMA66.
I have tried this with kernel 2.4.10 and 2.4.11pre1.
My system is a Dual K7, SMP kernel, 512MB RAM.
My root filesystem is on a RAID0 array across 4
Quantum AtlasV 9GB U160 SCSI disks, two on each
channel of the onboard Adaptec.
I have tried to use the Fireball in the array as well
but for some reason performance reduced!  110MB/s with
hdparm -t compared to 70MB/s. Could this be because of
the lack of chipset driver?
One other thing is I am running with the preemt patch,
though I tested it without as well as I remember.
Please CC any replys to steven.newbury1@ntlworld.com
as  I am not on the list.
