That relates more to policy than mechanism. I for one don't
consider the watchdog "sacred".
I think it's entirely reasonable that if the watchdog is disabled
(echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog) in order to give the
_full_ PMU HW to something else, then that something else needs
to be disabled (or otherwise instructed to give up the HW) before
the watchdog can be reenabled. If you don't want to risk not
being able to restart the watchdog, don't disable it.
