Well, the "tamedos" shareware does it that way. It works fairly well, but not 
too well. DOSEMU doesn't address this problem besides from the suspending 
whenever the dosemu window is iconified.
My idea was *not* to schedule a process for running, even if it is the only 
runnable one, if it is marked as a "presumably bad mannered" process and 
consumed its previous timeslice to the whole. Instead an idle slice is done. 
After a configureable amount of time, the bad mannered process is allowed to 
run again.
I know it's a crude idea for everyday Linux processes, but for dosemu driven 
applications, which behave badly in a multitasking OS *and* for which source 
code isn't available, it may be worth to discuss.
Kind regards
