I prefer to start the -mm merging in the second week of the merge window,
after the git trees have gone.
a) because that's the order in which the patches are staged
b) because that's the way in which they were tested: -mm patches without
   the presence of the git trees is basically untested code.
c) because I'm more able to handle rejects and other such crap than git
   victims^Wusers.
But sometimes I get bored and merge stuff early anyway.

OK, I'll move those two up into the i-got-bored batch, aim for tomorrow.
