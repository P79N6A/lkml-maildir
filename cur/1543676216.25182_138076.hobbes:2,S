2.4.20-9.2 (GinGin64)
Build failure when dpt is enabled as a module.  This is probably why
this and many other kernel modules were not included in the GinGin64
preview release.
Unfortunately it fails compilation in the same place for 2.4.21-rc7. 
I'm testing 2.5.70-bk* next.
LKML, any existing patches for this dpt_i2o module AMD64 compilation
issue?  Please CC me because not currently subscribed to lkml.
Thanks,
