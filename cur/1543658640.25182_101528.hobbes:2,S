Hello all,
how do I work with a mb that contains no keyboard controller, but has only USB
for keyboard and mouse?
While booting the kernel I get:
pc_keyb: controller jammed (0xFF)
(a lot of these :-)
and afterwards I cannot use the USB keyboard.
Everything works with a mb that contains a keyboard-controller, but where I use a
USB keyboard.
