perfctr was almost-ready-for-merge.  Then it was decided that perfmon was
the way ahead, and perfctr died.  And now perfmon isn't making progress in
the kernelwards direction (worse, perfmon is getting bigger, thus making a
merge harder and harder).  So we now have the worst of all worlds.
This is a problem.  I'd suggest that at this time we should be
concentrating on getting perfmon merged up rather than adding more stuff to
the out-of-tree version.
IOW: please send patches ;)
And keep sending them.  People want this.
Thanks.
