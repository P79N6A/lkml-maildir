Hi...
I have a curious issue with snd_intel8x0 ALSA driver:
Jan  7 01:14:27 werewolf-wl kernel: ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1f.5 disabled
Jan  7 01:14:27 werewolf-wl kernel: ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.5[B] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 21
Jan  7 01:14:27 werewolf-wl kernel: PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1f.5 to 64
Jan  7 01:14:27 werewolf-wl kernel: AC'97 0 analog subsections not ready
Jan  7 01:14:27 werewolf-wl kernel: intel8x0_measure_ac97_clock: measured 50136 usecs
Jan  7 01:14:27 werewolf-wl kernel: intel8x0: measured clock 219 rejected
Jan  7 01:14:27 werewolf-wl kernel: intel8x0: clocking to 48000
And this file is created:
/dev/.udev/failed/class@sound@controlC0
What does this 'failed' mean ? Why is my card 'not ready' ?
Sound works, anyways.
BTW, before alsa driver loads, I hear a strange whisper through the speakers,
nothing since the sound subsystem is initialized. Bad connections ?
