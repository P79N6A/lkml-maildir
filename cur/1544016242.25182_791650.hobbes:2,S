No, exports are needed for POHMELFS which I'm waiting a reply from
Andrew or Linus.

Nothing :)
Really. I implemented all the suggestions I got from the previous
reviews (including spaces and documentations, which btw were the only
ones :) way too long ago and did not get any other complaints. Actually
the tree I sent to you does not contain documentation update I have in
the own tree (pointed during review), so this can be added as todo entry :)
My fault I found that too late.
