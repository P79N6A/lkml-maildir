Actually kallsyms_lookup_name was the first interface like that.  And lots
of external kprobes used it like that - in fact tcp_probe.c is the first
one I've seen doing it differently.  But kallsyms_lookup_name is a really
awkward lowlevel buildingblock that's almost impossible to use correctly,
so this patch hides it behind the proper kprobes interface.
