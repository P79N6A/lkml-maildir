Indeed, thanks.
Hmm...the existing error path gets this wrong too. It's actually a
bit risky to disable the clock here since we might end up losing the
console.
I wonder what we're really supposed to do if the console is initialized
successfully, but the corresponding device fails to probe...?

Absolutely. Thanks again.

Hmm...this actually looks like a bug too. "port" is allocated
statically, so it shouldn't be freed. I wonder if anyone ever use this
driver as a module?
