Whatever happened to the Philips CM-205 driver?  It used to work really
well...  My mother has an ancient 486 with a beethoven audiocard and a LMS
CM-205 cdrom and windows-3.1 won't work for her (ISP only talks to 32-bit
systems like macintoshes, linux systems, and win95+... it's on an NT box
so YMMV).  Anyways, years ago I tried linux on it and it worked.  Now it
won't... ???  (sorry to ramble)   [aside: IDE doesn't work - constant
"drive may be confused?" errors.]
Oh, it's a 486 DX/2-66 with VLB ISA card (ADD^2 ??) and beethoven 16-bit
audiocard (as well as a buncha other stuff).  12MB ram.  I don't know what
else is needed to be known...
Incidentally, 2.3.28 segmentation-faults and resets if one tries to mount
a SCSI disk (Toshiba XM-4101TA) while the drive is spinning up on an
AIC-7xxx (294x UW). 2.2 doesn't do this...  haven't tried 2.3.29 yet.
Oh, BTC 24X cdroms seem to go to sleep after a while...  Linux has a -cow-
talking to them until they wake up completely (timeouts on device)...  Is
it possible this cdrom needs a wakeup or keepawake call?  (not sure, I've
-avoided- looking at the IDE cdrom driver code :)
G'day, eh? :)  (and thanks for any and all answers 'xcept spam :)

PS: Anyone know why FIC PA-2007 boards just suddenly die without reason
after about a year or so?  Lost one a bit ago and first to go was IDE
controller, nuking just about all my IDE hardware...
