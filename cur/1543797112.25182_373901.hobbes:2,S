If a 2.6.x.1 is released and a vulnerability is discovered with the wrong 
timing, this leaves us with a kernel that has had little or no testing.
We already had a 2.6.x that didn't even boot on half my servers. When 2.6.x.1 
is the first bootable version and a security patch arrives, this leaves me 
with an uncomfortable choice between an old, stable and vulnerable version 
and a new, shiny and untested one.
Having 2.6.x-1.y and 2.6.x.y would avoid this situation.
