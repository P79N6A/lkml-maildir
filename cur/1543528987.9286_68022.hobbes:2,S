Could be done with nifty makefiles something like:
    DRIVERS=$(shell ls *.make)
    all:
	    (for i in ${DRIVERS};do\
		make -f $${i}.make driver module;\
	    done)
	    L_OBJS += $(shell ls drivers/*.o)
	    M_OBJS += $(shell ls modules/*.o) 
so that drivers can include their own makefiles,
so drivers can either be standalone, or dropped into
the kernel tree without having to patch up any makefiles
and yet they still mystically work...
