I think you're still talking from a theoretical standpoing, while all my 
arguments are practical.
In _practice_, I hope that
 (a) we don't see that very much (ie the people for whom things work 
     already are a strong argument that this is less of a problem in
     practice than people try to make it appear)
 (b) drivers, _especially_ on notebooks, are already able to handle an 
     incoming interrupt with the device in D3 state and returning 0xff
     for all reads.
     In particular, this is exactly the same thing that you get on a 
     surprise device removal too.
iow it really _really_ shouldn't matter that a shared interrupt comes in
after (or before) a device has gone to sleep. Because a driver that can't
handle that schenario is buggy for totally unrelated reasons, and doing a 
"free_irq()/request_irq()" pair at suspend time is _not_ the solution!

And I say that's not true. See (b) above. As far as I can tell, the 
"interrupt when in D3" really looks _exactly_ the same as "interrupt when 
device was just removed by the user", and nobody will hopefully argue that 
free_irq/request_irq can protect against forced removal?

... and I don't think this has _anything_ to do with free_irq/request_irq, 
and everything to do with the fact that we can try to make at least the 
common drivers "hardened" for unexpected interrupts coming in when the hw 
might not be ready for them.
