I don't go out to fetch patches, I really want to see them come to me (and
even then preferably through a few people acting as quality control and
maintainership).
And if there is no clear maintainership relationship and you need to send
them directly to me, I really want plain-text patches (they can be big if
needed), with:
 - one patch per email. Not attachements, and not several patches in one 
   email one after the other. Several emails, with one patch each, and if 
   they are interdependent, make the subject line be something like
	[DVB PATCH 1/9] Replace frobutomic counter with sequence numbers
   so that when they get re-ordered by the email system (as they 
   inevitably will be), I can see it from the overview.
   The "[xxx]" syntax is important: my scripts will automatically strip 
   that part out and replace it with "PATCH", leaving the commit message
   as just
	[PATCH] Replace frobutomic counter with sequence numbers
   since once it's in the tree, the ordering is implicit in the SC.
 - explanation of the patch for the changelogs at the top of the patch, so 
   that I don't have to make up my own explanations for what it does and
   get it wrong.
 - Make sure your mailer doesn't corrupt the message with whitespace 
   damage (spaces at ends of lines should remain, and tabs should be 
   tabs), or with stupidities like 7-bit quoted-printable crap.
Please.
