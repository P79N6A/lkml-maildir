I think we can do something about this, actually. We can cause printk to
buffer for low severity levels. In fact, we can dynamically decide to
buffer based on string length, baud rate, and message priority, trying to
always stay below a timer tick.
People running serial may in fact be mostly doing embedded development and
might actually care to know that serial console is destroying their
latency.
