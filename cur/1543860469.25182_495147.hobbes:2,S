We do this on ARM - if page_mapping() is NULL, we flush the kernel
alias unconditionally.  However, we have no view where the user
mapping of that page is, which is where the problem is.  Cache lines
remain allocated for the user mapping and data contained within is
not visible via the kernel mapping.

It would've been nice to have had your view when the whole thing blew
up.
However, it's not only FUSE which is suffering - direct-IO also doesn't
work.  If my analysis is correct, only _two_ users of get_user_pages()
with the current process actually does the right thing and that's ptrace
and ELF core dumping.  All other users are buggy.
