On this path you can take a look at the code Jay is working on, supporting
DLSw in userlevel, using PF_LLC sockets.
Hey, I'm even considering making NetBEUI a userlevel implementation after I
finish the restructuring of PF_LLC/core wrt using only one struct sock for
easier locking and for it to look more like the tcp codepaths (not including
the state machine, of course ;) ).
