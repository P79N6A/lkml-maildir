And we (kernel developers) don't care what drivers digi wants people
to use.  We empower people to use free software with whatever hardware
can be supported.  Our drivers are often not from vendors at all, and
even when vendor drivers exist we often support better (in our opinion)
drivers

There are people who just want the card supported.  There's no reason
to deny the driver to them.

Sure, we can have the situation easily.  If you want us to care for your
other driver make sure it's submitted for kernel inclusion.

You do have lots of rights.  But as you put the code under the GPL we
do have rights aswell now, and one of the most important rights you gave
us is to modify and redistribute the code under the terms of the GPL.
