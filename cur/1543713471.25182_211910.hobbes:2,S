That's a good point.  There is at least some cost (at least 1 lock)
associated with walking the rmap chains.  If it can be avoided, it might
as well be.  
But, if someone needs the "no walk" interface, just wrap the function:
foo(page)
{
	rmap_results = get_rmap_stuff(page);
	__foo(page, rmap_results);
}
__foo(page, rmap_results)
{
...
}

Could you explain where you're getting these "magic numbers?"  I don't
quite understand the significance of 2048 physical addresses or 512 MB
of memory.
Zoltan, it appears that we have a bit of an inherent conflict with how
much CPU each of you is expecting to use in the removal and migration
cases.  You're coming from a HPC environment where each CPU cycle is
valuable, while the people trying to remove memory are probably going to
be taking CPUs offline soon anyway, and care a bit less about how
efficient they're being with CPU and cache resources.  
Could you be a bit more explicit about how expensive (cpu-wise) these
migrate operations can be?
