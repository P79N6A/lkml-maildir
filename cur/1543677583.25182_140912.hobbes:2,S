No, I hope that the DMA allocation function will be backported in the
near future from 2.5 into 2.4. If I get some time, I may even do it
myself and propose a patch.
And when it's done, I'll just have to remove the two definitions 
without changing anything in my code and it will just work.
Besides, having two versions (2.4 and 2.5) which don't diverge to much
is much easier for the maintainer.
