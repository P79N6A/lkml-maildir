That is true.

Are they willing to trade off the performance of LTT to get this?  I
thought this was being touted as a "when you need to test" type of
thing, not a "run it all the time" type of feature.

And a driver will never want to have both a relay channel, and a simple
debug output at the same time?  You are now requiring them to look for
that data in two different points in the fs.

So, since you are proposing that relayfs be mounted all the time, where
do you want to mount it at?  I had to provide a "standard" location for
debugfs for people to be happy with it, and the same issue comes up
here.
Also, why not export your relayfs ops so that someone useing debugfs can
create a relay channel in it, or in any other type of fs they might
create?
