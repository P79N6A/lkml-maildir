No, it's a well known ioremaped() address
into the IMMR space.  The only physical
addresses in any of the CPM/CPM2 are
those required to by the buffer descriptors.
There are DPRAM offsets, but they should
be just that, offsets from either a virtual
or physical base address as required.
Too many people screw around in this
CPM support code without fully understanding
the original implementation or its intended
use with the peripheral drivers.  A "better
idea" often breaks all drivers except the one
that is being changed.
