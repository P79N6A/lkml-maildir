Right. What I have done is in the PSPACE_EXIT condition all children
when they die self reap and have the global process reaper set to their
parent.  However since exit_signal == -1 the initial process reaper
never sees them.
Even for a nested pspace I figure it is an error for anything to outlive
init.  The wid not working is a valid reason for this however if it was
really necessary a new wid value could be allocated.  As nothing on
the inside of a pspace is directly aware of it. 
The situation is very similar to being behind a NAT firewall.
