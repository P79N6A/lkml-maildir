Does anyone ever got an ISA multiport card from Rayon Technology,
probably a Taiwaneese manufacturer ?
I got one of their card which _mostly_ work with Linux standard serial
driver, using setserial, which find correctly the 8 16550A UARTs
the card should hold. But the problem is that it sometimes seems
to miss xon/xoff sync.
While using a serial terminal seems ok, printing to serial printers
is impossible, as it discard the end of the document and sometimes
parts of it.
I got a new card which come with a Linux driver, but unfortunatly,
the pre-compiled 2.2 modules use the major 30  used by iBCS drivers
we do use.
There is a source file for the driver, but it seems to not work 
correctly too, and ends by crashing the kernel. (There is no license
to it it seems, at least with the distribution I got)
Another thing: there card is said to work either in Digi or Star
mode, depending of a jumper setting. I think Digi should refer to
DigiBoard, but I've never heard of Star, and they say under Linux
only Star mode is supported.
Any clues, anyone ?
Thank you,
François Désarménien
