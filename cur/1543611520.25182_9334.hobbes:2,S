I think I remember reading about that on kernel traffic...

I think people would have trouble with the versions of their apps being
reported.  Some people that is...
But, all something like this really needs is just to be blessed by someone
high in the kernel strata...
It doesn't actually *need* to be in the kernel though.  A user space package
would work great.  Run from a cron job, and report kernel version, and
optionally some other pertinent info.
Perodically, (monthly?) you would get an email asking you to fill out this
form and you'd get your registry with bug/status reports.
Even bigger, some sort of bug tracking system could be tied to this...
