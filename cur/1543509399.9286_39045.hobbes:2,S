I've recently installed the 2.2.12 kernel, and have been getting the
following
odd kernel error when accessing any of my CD drives...  I didn't see it
mentioned in the archives, but forgive me if it's already been caught.
The error has been around since atleast 2.3.5, as it gave me the same
problem.  The relevant entries in my syslog are:
Sep 15 00:06:38 miranda kernel: ATAPI device hdd: 
Sep 15 00:06:38 miranda kernel:   Error: Illegal request -- (Sense
key=0x05) 
Sep 15 00:06:38 miranda kernel:   (reserved error code) -- (asc=0x6f,
ascq=0x03) 
Sep 15 00:07:05 miranda kernel: hdd: command error: status=0x51 {
DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
Sep 15 00:07:05 miranda kernel: hdd: command error: error=0x50 
Sep 15 00:07:05 miranda kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:40 (hdd),
sector 1216 
If this is a known bug/etc sorry for sending it in again.
