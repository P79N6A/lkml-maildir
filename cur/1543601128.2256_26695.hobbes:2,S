after spending a few dayz trying to figure out where this is happening, i
noticed that the alloc_pages() errors only occur after used memory goes
above 899MB. this is the limit of physical memory unless you enable the
himem option. the machines i had been seeing this on all had 1G+ memory
and i had enabled the 4G himem option on each of them. so turn that option
off and you will no longer see alloc_pages errors. you'll have to suffer
through only having 900MB of memory to play with though. ;>
