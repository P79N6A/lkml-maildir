i have digged out an older HT-box .config of yours and have reproduced 
an assert quite similar to the one above. Found one bug in that area: 
the assert (conditional on RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT) was done a bit too early, 
i have fixed this in my tree and have uploaded -51-02.

do the 51-02 (and later) kernels work on the UP Athlon box?
