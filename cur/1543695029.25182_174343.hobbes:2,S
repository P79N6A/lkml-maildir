drivers/scsi/qlogicfc.h has #
#define QLOGICFC_REQ_QUEUE_LEN  127
When I use mdadm to build a raid array out of 8 drives on the same 
channel, it can either hang silently or die with a warning that it should 
never get here.
If I up the define to 1023, I am able to build a raid array and run tests 
on it.
