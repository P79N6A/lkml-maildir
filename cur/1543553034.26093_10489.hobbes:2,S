There are one bunch of people running Linux on a flat memory space with no
protection although their goal was to make Linux run on mmuless embedded
hardware.
See www.uclinux.org; the uclinux guys started a 2.4 port recently. Basically
the idea is to have a mm-nommu/ directory which implements a mostly compatible
replacement for the mm layer (obviously stuff like mmap dont work without an
mmu and fork is odd), and a set of binary loaders to load flat binaries with
relocations.
That I think is the project that overlaps ..
