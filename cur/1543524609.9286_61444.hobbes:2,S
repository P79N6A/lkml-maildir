While configuring a Redhat 6.1 with a new 2.2.14 Kernel on a Pentium
III-450 with probably ASUS Board i was not able to get the network
interface working [a PCI Card]:
The folloing 2 lines may show why:
tulip.c:v0.91g-ppc 7/16/99 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
eth1: Digital DC21040 Tulip rev 35 at 0xb000, 00:00:C0:EE:FE:0E, IRQ 0.
                                                                     ^^
I looked around in the Sourcecode. I read that the IRQ comes from the
PCI BIOS. I've played around a little bit with the PCI Settings in the
Kernel but it doesn't change anything.
The BIOS gives me the possibility to allocate a static IRQ Number to a PCI
Slot, i wanted to try to set the IRQ Number in the sourcecode, without
querying the PCI BIOS, which line i have to modify ?
thanks,
karsten
