Any file that is accessible without needing specific user and group
permissions will still be accessible.  In essence you are an enhanced
version of the nobody user when you access files outside of your
namespace.  What you can't do is create files as you cannot be
represented on the filesystem.

Yes.  But the whole system is assumed to be in the same user namespace,
so that is a reasonable assumption.  Once we break that assumption we
need to do something different.  There are a few network filesystems
that are at least working on using keys to authenticate users.

It needs to be looked at, but it shouldn't slow the same namespace
case, and permission checking is largely a slow path issue.  So a little
overhead at open time is preferred to overhead after you get the file
open.
Mapping users is clearly a separate problem, but related problem.  For
sharing read-only data that you don't mind sharing with everyone the
current set of semantics I have described is fine.
