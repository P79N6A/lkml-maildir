I checked that whole rtc / BCD logic again. We always set RTC_ALWAYS_BCD:
#ifndef RTC_PORT
#define RTC_PORT(x)    (0x70 + (x))
#define RTC_ALWAYS_BCD 1       /* RTC operates in BCD mode */
#endif
Nothing ever defines RTC_PORT and RTC_ALWAYS_BCD
So we can get rid of that stuff completely.

This should probably go here:
        if (acpi_gbl_FADT.header.revision >= FADT2_REVISION_ID &&
            acpi_gbl_FADT.century) {
--->
 	}
It does not matter much, because BCD_TO_BIN(0) is 0, but it makes a
lot of sense.
