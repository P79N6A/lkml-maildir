Trying 2.6.0-test6 on a brand-new HP nc4000 notebook, based on a Pentium-M,
with Debian sid userspace.  Kernel built with a fairly boring/naive config.
After boot things are fine for a while, then without any visible diagnostic 
output, the machine gets very slow.  Running top shows that events/0 is 
consuming the CPU.
Suggests for where to look or what to try?
