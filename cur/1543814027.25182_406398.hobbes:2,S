Apologies for the lack of additional information, this is simply a lack 
of time on my behalf.  My first attempt to bisect 2.6.15 <-> 2.6.16-rc5 
produced a kernel which caused udev to crash (and stop init).  I will 
shift the goalposts and try again.  Once I have the results I will post 
them to bugzilla.  I will also post the contents of /sys/class/dvb as 
requested above.
Thanks,
Tom.
