How does your patch ensures that we meet the driver alignment
restrictions ? Like you said, you need atleast "even" byte alignment
for IDE etc..
And also, are there any restrictions on how much the "minimum" IO
size has to be ? I mean, can I read "1" byte ? I guess you are
not relaxing it (yet)..
Thanks,
Badari
