I'm more thinking about something like this:
module foo [FOO]
	tristate "do you want foo?"
	depends on USB && BAR
	source file1.c
	source file2.c if BAZ
Avoiding direct Makefile fragments would give us far more flexibility in the 
final Makefile output.

That's a real problem and it would be a step back of what we have right now, 
so I'm not exactly comfortable with it.
