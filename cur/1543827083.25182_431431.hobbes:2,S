There's no need for an atomic op - at the most the architecture would need
local_irq_disable() protection, and that's only if it doesn't have an
atomic-wrt-this-cpu add instruction.

Not from my reading of arch/ia64/kernel/smp.c:handle_IPI().  And if I've
misread it, ia64 has broken invalidate_bh_lrus() and who knows what else.

That's my point - probably the check in __alloc_pages() isn't needed.

That's unfortunate patch ordering.  Do it (much) later I guess.
