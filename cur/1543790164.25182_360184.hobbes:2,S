You're right. I've added a release. That may explain a memory leak I was
seeing that I couldn't find.

I take it then that:
 (1) the write_access parameter to do_file_page() is there purely so that
     handle_pte_fault() can jump to it rather than calling it since they have
     the same parameter set and return value;
 (2) and that do_file_page() always installs a read-only PTE so that
     do_wp_page() will be called subsequently on a write attempt.
