Hello,
I'm using PPPoE with an i586 machine running 2.4.2.
The machine connects fine and allows network traffic to pass
through the link.
However, certain websites seem to choke.
(notable ones are www.chapters.ca and www.hp.com)
Using Lynx or Netscape I get the same results, a few bytes of
traffic are received and then nothing (eventually the connection
times out).  
The same does not happen in windows.  (ugh)
I have not encountered any machine that I have telnet/ftp/ssh
access to that breaks in this way so I can only confirm that http traffic 
is not working.
This gateway machine does masquerading, and internal machines and the external
machine react the same way.
TIA
