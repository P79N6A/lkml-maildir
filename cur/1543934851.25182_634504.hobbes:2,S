It seems that this last report gives the third one: ieee1394 to the pack,
so probably, you can hold on a "minute" - this all needs some rethinking.
(But, if you've begun with this already, let it be clear at last too.)

OK! But, in the meantime could you send your current .config? I wonder
e.g. if there could be used this new ieee1394 code from
init_ohci1394_dma.c?
You are really helpful, thanks,
