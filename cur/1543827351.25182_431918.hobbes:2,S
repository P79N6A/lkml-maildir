Thanks for the updated patch!  It wouldn't quite build (proc_misc.c still 
referenced the old rt_overload_* variables, fixup patch attached removing 
those print statements).  I have it running on a 4 way opteron box running 
prio-preempt in a timed while loop, exiting only on failure.  It's been 
running fine for several minutes - usually fails in under a mintue.  We'll 
see how it's doing in the morning :-)
