That is correct.  It had some utility when a process could
only be a member of one group at a time and for giving files
to someone else while keeping all others out.  Chown was
expected to disable s[ug]id bits.  The value of an
unrestricted chown is very small and will be eliminated by
ACLs.
Quotas turned it into a security issue.   With unrestricted
chown a user could chown large files to another (preferably
unlimited) uid and avoid the limits and usage charges.  It
also allows one user to sabotage another by causing that
user to go over quota on files he has no knowledge or control
over.  Quotas and unrestricted chown do not mix.
