No. This would be against Linux/Unix philosphy of giving you enough rope. 
Maybe I want to break my hd? You never know. Or maybe the same commands 
work perfectly well on a different hd/controller? In general, if you don't 
understand the consequences of something you want to do, then *don't* do 
it! Or at least have a backup handy and don't complain afterwards...

Of course. Boot/change into single user mode, sync, and remount any 
readwrite mounted fs readonly. Then it should be safe to check things out 
with hdparm, at least I have done it this way for ages and never run into a 
problem even though in my early stage of hdparm experimentation I would 
cause kernel crashes more often then not... Chances are that if readonly 
works fine, so will write, so once I find the fastest settings that still 
give 100% reliability on reads I switch back to normal network multi user 
mode and try read-write. Never failed me so far but YMMV, so keep a backup...
Best regards,
Anton
