Grrr.... Listen what the hell did you call this ioctl with _another_ name,
absent both in BSD and in SVR4??? :-)
I remember the patch doing the same thing and I zapped this crap
exactly because it was another linuxish hack moving from bsd api
and not moving closer to svr4.

PS. Well, and did you think about one thing: "linux" port of any application
which does not work with linuxes can smell a bit anti-social for many people,
who do not compile from sources. And for all the people, if the port is binary.
