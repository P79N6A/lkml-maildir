Currently, you have to (needlessy) enter the MD menu for example and
*in there* read the help text of CONFIG_MD, then decide if you want
it or not. I hope my use-menuconfig-objects patches help this issue
a bit ... not only avoiding to enter it, but also making the help
text available in the upper level. Take CONFIG_EMBEDDED, it DTRTs.
I do not think it will be too helpful to have help texts on menu, for
the "important" Kconfig objects (config, choice, menuconfig) should
have it - and they have it.
