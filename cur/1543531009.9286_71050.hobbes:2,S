Actually the scenario I described is more serious than the one
right before ret_from_syscall.
If an interrupt happens right before ret_from_syscall, the need_resched
is set in the CURRENT process. Yes the current process will go back
to user mode and continue its execution.  But 10 ms later, the timer
interrupt will happen, and an examination of the need_resched flag would
convice kernel to do a rescheduling.  Therefore the maximum preemption
latency is 10 ms.
The scenario I described essentially makes the need_resched flag *LOST*.
The maximum latency is 200 ms - an human perceivable amount.  To me,
it is not even acceptable for desktop systems.  Let alone embedded
systems.

By the way, the fix I am suggesting is orthogonal to Ingo's low-latency
work.  Ingo's patch shortens the time periods when kernel runs without 
checking need_resched (in other words, shortens the preemption latency).
My fix is to prevent need_resched flag from getting lost.  
A kernel applying Ingo's patch but without my fix would still have
the scenario I was describing and potentially up to 200 ms preemption
latency.  (I did not do a test, but pretty much sure that is the case.)
