If you are exposing the kernel locks to userspace to implement
mutexes (eg POSIX mutexes), deadlock checking is a feature you want
to have to complain with POSIX. According to some off the record
requirements I've been given, some applications badly need it (I have 
a hard time believing that they are so broken, but heck...).
