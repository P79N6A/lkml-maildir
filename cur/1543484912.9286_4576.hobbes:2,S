Subject: New video device drivers needed

The company I work for may be interested in developing a
tv-station-in-a-box sort of application on linux.  In order for this to
happen, we've got to have device drivers written for an (as yet)
unspecified video effects card.  Possible candidates are the matrox
digimix, and TrueVision Targa 2000.
We'll also need drivers for an mpeg-2 decoder board.
I'm not able to write both the application and device drivers.  
Thus I'm interested in soliciting assistance for the drivers.  Some
funding would most likely be available if that would help. (Does it ever
hurt?)
Thanks,
