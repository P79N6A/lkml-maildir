*No problems when using 10000.
But I think of this as workaround only.
I have read the "Scaling dcache with RCU" article from linuxjournal.com
to get some insight how things should work. Pretty complicated.
I added some printk statements in dcache.c to see what functions
actually get called to shink a dcache during a du -s.
The only one I found is prune_dcache().
Which events should trigger the use of d_invalidate() ?
