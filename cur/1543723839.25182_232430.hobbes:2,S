Do you know where exactly it was deadlocked? As fas as sunzilog goes
the only change was that instead of embedding serio structure inside
uart_sunzilog_port it is now accessed through a pointer. The rest of
the changes are in serio core and should not depend on type of serio
port involved, locking rules have not been changed either...
Any additional info will be appreciated...
