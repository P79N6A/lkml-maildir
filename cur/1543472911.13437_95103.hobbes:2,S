Agreed.

I am happy that it seems I have understood the code right ;) and I
finished thinking your same thing.
I tried to not base the thread safety of update_shared_mappings() on
lock_kernel() but I can' t do that because I was always going to deadlock
in down() some way...
The first ostacle is that to get the vma with find_vma() (I need the vma
to know which other shared mappings are in the game) I need the mmap_sem
semaphore held and so I am forced to down() on the mmap_sem of the current
process as first thing so I can' t do an ordered down() to avoid
deadlocking...
