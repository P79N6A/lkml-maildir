That seems likely to break other stuff, as new-style
threads become more common. Right now, many tools are
unaware of new-style threads. Pointing at the tgid
directory (POSIX PID directory) lets tools ignore threads.

This is an interesting problem for sure. The link was
pointing to a directory that didn't get listed, except
that CLONE_THREAD wasn't exactly a popular feature yet.
So it was very seldom that the distinction mattered.
Currently, I rely on checking for /proc/self/task to
see if threads can be examined. Like this:
task_dir_missing = stat("/proc/self/task", &sbuf);
That wouldn't work if /proc/self pointed at the task.
It certainly seems to me that the intent of /proc/self is
to point to a "process", which is a tgid in kernel terms.
Back in the 2.4.xx days, that was a pid in kernel terms.
Now that we have CLONE_THREAD and the tgid, a "process"
is represented by the tgid. Pointing to the tgid matches
what other OSes do.
I think there is something clearly defective about having
the /proc/self link point to a hidden directory. It could
be pointed at /proc/42/task/58 and such I guess, but I
think tools could break as new-style threads begin to get
used in the real world.
