Okay, I've misunderstood you before.

We have a debugfs interface and a kvm_stat script which shows exactly 
that (including a breakdown of the reasons for the exit).

No, 32-bit hosts are fully supported (except a 32-bit host can't run a 
32-bit guest).
Admittedly, virtualization is a memory-intensive operation, so a 64-bit 
host will usually be used.
