APM_MAX_EVENTS appears to be 20, not a power of 2. GCC does the
obvious transform of modulo to an ANDL when the modulus is a sane
value. Rewrite the above as a four line function and run it through
gcc -S to see to difference bewteen APM_MAX_EVENTS=20 and =32.

<shrug> It's probably not a wide-spread problem. How many places in
the kernel use ringbuffers that aren't sized to a power of 2?

modulo_add? But it's probably unneccessary, unless this really is
widespread. Even then, just correcting those already in place would be
better than adding yet another abstraction of a simple operation to
the kernel.

Check to see if those are power of 2 sized buffers. gcc really will do
those correctly.
