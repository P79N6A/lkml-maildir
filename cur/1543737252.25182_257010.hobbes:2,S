OK, poor choice of words.  Correctness of course comes before ease of
use.  I believe the realtime-lsm module satisfies both requirements.

I did not mean to imply that I disagree with the realtime-lsm approach. 
Obviously some kernel support is required, and realtime-lsm seems to
solve the problem with the minimum possible change to the kernel.  And
above all it is a proven working solution that has been field tested for
months by many, many users.
