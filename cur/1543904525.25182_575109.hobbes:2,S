What kind of serial port and machine is this on? From what I can see, a 
standard 16550 UART (not a special variant) just doesn't have any 
support for clearing RTS on its own when its input FIFO gets too full. 
The kernel would have to do it in that case. I'm not seeing where it 
would be controlling that automatically (as opposed to manually from the 
application with TIOCM_RTS). I'm also not sure if the UART gives the 
kernel enough information for it to even be able to control this line 
properly automatically.
That's assuming it actually is a 16550 or similar with a 16-byte FIFO at 
all, which assuming it's a non-ancient PC it should be, but who knows.
