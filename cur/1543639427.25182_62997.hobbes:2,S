In 2.5, I changed ARM to indicate the last word as the EIP (so we get more
context as Andrew Morton suggests.)  However, ksymoops now seems to ignore
the '()' !
At some point I plan to check what happens if its the second to last.  I
suspect ksymoops is looking for the strings ' (' and ') ', the second of
which obviously doesn't exist.
