rt_mutex_slowlock seems to return -EDEADLK even though caller didn't ask
for deadlock detection (detect_deadlock=0). That is bad because then the
caller will not check for it. It ought to simply leave the task blocked.
It only happens with CONFIG_DEBUG_RT_MUTEXES. That one also messes up the
task->pi_waiters as earlier reported.
