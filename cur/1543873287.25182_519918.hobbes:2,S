Accounting becomes easy if we have a container pointer in struct page.
 This can form base ground for building controllers since any memory
related controller would be interested in tracking pages.  However we
still want to evaluate if we can build them without bloating the
struct page.  Pagecache controller (2) we can implement with container
pointer in struct page or container pointer in struct address space.
Building on this patchset is much simple and and we hope the bloat in
struct page will be compensated by the benefits in memory controllers
in terms of performance and simplicity.
Adding too many controllers and accounting parameters to start with
will make the patch too big and complex.  As Balbir mentioned, we have
a plan and we shall add new control parameters in stages.
