I got curious enough about what you were seeing to format a disk, unpack
a kernel tree on it, compile the entire tree on the M/O disk and then unmount
and fsck it.
Clean
(Fujtisu M2513. 640Mb disk) on an Adaptec 1542B.
The only problems I know about and can reproduce is that some vendor (Ive not
figured who) seems to ship a scsi aware "eject" binary that uses scsi generic
to issue eject commands but doesnt flush the caches.
But since you aren't I assume using eject..
