Ok, seems we need to be a bit more precise.

Which is what we call the TOD clock.

We 100% agree that sched_clock() should be virtual.

Ok, this means we will need Jans patch that makes sched_clock() use the
cpu timer. You said that this change would require that scheduler_tick()
has to use virtual time as well, which would be the second patch.
And then we require a third patch that fixes the process accounting.

It is not only a matter of tooling. The tool needs to have enough,
precise information to actually return the requested information. If the
user want to know how much real cpu a process has used (and our user do
want to know that), the output of /proc/<pid>/stat fields 14-17 have to
contain the real cpu usage for user/system/cumulated user and cumulated
system time. If they would contain the virtual cpu usage you cannot tell
how much real cpu a process used, even if you have access to the steal
timer numbers. The reason is that you would have to synchronize the
scheduling points in the guest and the hypervisor to come up with
reasonable numbers. This is something we obviously do not want to do.
The output of /proc/<pid>/stat is what Christian and I are complaining
about. Since the introduction of CFS and VIRT_ACCOUNTING=y the output
of /proc/<pid>/stat has changed its meaning and in our opinion it is
wrong now.
