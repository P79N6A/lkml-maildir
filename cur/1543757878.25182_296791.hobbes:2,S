It depends on how you process your mail, if you move to folders with 
determanent logic, checking various lists in order, then it always does 
the same thing. If you use the list header it could do what you suggest. 
I personally push a lot of the mailing lists to a news (usenet) server, 
since it allows a single copy of a message to be indexed in multiple 
groups, and some clients will skip what you have seen better than others.
