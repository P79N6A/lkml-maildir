Hello,
i apologize for being bothering you twice in three days but i was 
wondering whether someone has found reason why ndiswrapper does not load 
on 2.6.19-rc2-mm2.
NOTE: it seems to be related to tainting
I try to resume a bit:
__create_workqueue         undefined symbol
queue_work                       undefined symbol
After patching modules.c to remove tainting of ndiswrapper i got to load 
it without problems but it doesnt seem a modules.c problem (those 
symbols are EXPORT_GPL since at least 2.6.18), modules.c and workqueue.c 
are as of 2.6.16 kernel.
Is there any new ?
If i can tell my user opinion about tainting is that it s...cks in 
general, dont know any case in which it fits something, i mean in life 
not just linux kernel.
One who uses ndiswrapper doest it at his own risk, a developer or 
debugger can manage...
And the blacklist hardcoded in modules.c, as someone used to say couple 
days ago, seems really hard to carry on !
THanks to anyone who will find time to show me the light,
Gianluca
