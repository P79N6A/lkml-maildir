It doesn't matter whether it's RedHat, or any other distribution.
They're all the same kernel.
Look at schedule() in kernel/sched.c to see the heart of the scheduler.
My understanding is that it's a weighted round robiner, considering such
things as the nice value and how often a process gets caught "holding
the ball" by the clock interrupt.
Hope this helps.
