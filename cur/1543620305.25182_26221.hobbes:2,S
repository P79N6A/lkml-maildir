Which patch did you take in ?
Post 20020110_1 patches add support to old chipsets (pre-ATA66) but are known to
have buggy chipset detection code.
I've just received a new ECS K7S5AL (old one broken) so I'll be able to test the code myself
again (currently memtest86 testing).
Expect debugged code next week.
