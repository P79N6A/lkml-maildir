The 815 + e100 thing is _not_ a hardware issue. Its some subtle driver
related things, and of course Intel are keen to push e100 rather than
help people fix the kernel driver so not much help.
I've fixed some of the problems in recent -ac (the power management timeout)
which is now in Linus tree. Arjan van de Ven also fixed some other bits.
I'd be interested to know if that helps (to keep the test simple and single
variable you can use the -ac eepro100.c file in Linus 2.4.9)
