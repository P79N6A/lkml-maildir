And can't you tell that a certain percentage of buffers are owned by a
single file/process?  It would seem that a simple metric of
       if ##% of the buffer/cache is used by 1 process/file, start
       writing the file out to disk, even if there is no pressure.
might to the trick to handle this case.

Would it also be good to say that pressure should increase as the
buffer.free percentage goes down?  It won't stop you from filling the
buffer, but it should at least start pushing out pages to disk
earlier.
