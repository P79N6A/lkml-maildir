Well, hopefully the "list->func()" MUST do the right thing [*], so your patch 
is not necessary.
For example, most structures are freed with kfree()/kmem_cache_free() and 
these functions MUST imply an smp_mb() [if/when exchanging data with other 
cpus], or else many uses in the kernel should be corrected as well.
[*] : In particular, slab code managment does something special when 
transfering local objects from local cpu A store to 'other cpus B'.
Other mechanisms should also use some kind of memory barrier in order to 
transfer an object to another cpu too, or you could imagine in flight stores 
from CPU A overwriting an object that was 'given' to CPU B.
