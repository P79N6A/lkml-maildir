I tried it on Linux 2.2.9 plus my knfsd patches. I started and stoped nfsd.
I didn't see any problems.  Given that 2.2.10 and 2.2.10-ac10 have quite a
few NFS problem which I couldn't reproduce on 2.2.7 and 2.2.9, I tend to
believe NFS in 2.2.10 and 2.2.10-ac10 is broken. I will check out 2.2.10
to verify it. But I don't have time to work on ac kernels.
