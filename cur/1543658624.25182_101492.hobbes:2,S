The last part doesn't make a lot of sense.
Use of an inline function is just that: usage.  It matters not at
all whether that function is invoked via inline integration or via
subroutine call.  This is merely an implementation detail within
the code which provides that function.
Such functions are part of the offered API which have global scope,
that's all.
