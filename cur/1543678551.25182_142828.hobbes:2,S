Thanks for the report.
It took me a while to find because I am using a newer nfs-utils which
exports and unexports things differently, and there are lots of extra
bugs that were affecting it :-(
However the one that was affecting you can be fixed by:
diff ./net/sunrpc/cache.c~current~ ./net/sunrpc/cache.c

I'll make sure it and a bunch of other fixes get to Linus shortly.
