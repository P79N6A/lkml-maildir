Just for completeness and to avoid confusion: Andrea's posted patch applied
to a kernel without lock_map_size(like 2.3.x).
The correct patch for 2.2.x is:
--- mm/swapfile.c    	Mon Jul 12 20:16:36 1999
+++ mm/swapfile.c	Mon Jul 12 20:17:52 1999
@@ -649,7 +649,8 @@
 			else
 				p->swap_map[page] = SWAP_MAP_BAD;
 		}
-		nr_good_pages = swap_header->info.last_page - i;
+		nr_good_pages = swap_header->info.last_page -
+		                swap_header->info.nr_badpages - 1;
 		lock_map_size = (p->max + 7) / 8;
 		if (error) 
 			goto bad_swap;
Is this also correct for 2.2.x?
don't worry, be happy,
