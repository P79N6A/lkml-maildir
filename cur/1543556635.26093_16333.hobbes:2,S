4.4BSD (FreeBSD 4.2-release) returns EPERM for truncate on immutable (schg
or uchg), in which case current Linux truncate(2) is broken. So if we want
to return the same as FreeBSD then we either need to:
a) change
vfs_permission() (and make sure all other cases returning EPERM for
immutable is ok) or 
b) we need to move that explicit check in
do_sys_truncate() above the call to permission().
