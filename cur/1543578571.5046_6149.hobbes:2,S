There no chipset calls that allow one to envoke 32-bit data access on the
data-taskfile register.  This may bite you in the arse! (see below)

This is why it is better to do on paper the timings and not create code
that is varible based on the "ide-bus-clock" not the "pci-bus-clock".
You can only run timings at 33MHz clocking, period.  The exceptions are
for those that can report from the chipset that a clocking-base other than
33 is detected.
I told you that I have the new code that is scheduled for 2.5 certified on
analizers to be technically correct as it relates to the "state diagrams"
in the standard.

Linus I know how the driver is to work and how it behaves in
non-multimodes, but I am not sure that even Mark Lord could tells you or
me about the true nature of the current multimode with various chipsets.
Sheesh some of them are now documenting that special bits must be set to
do 32-bit word access on the dataport.
