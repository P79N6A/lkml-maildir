I'm not entirely convinced wget is going to be an efficient way to
synchronize and fetch your tree, its simplicitly is great though. It's a
tradeoff between optimzing and re-using existing tools (like webservers).
Perhaps that's why you were compressing the stuff too? It sounds better
not to compress the stuff on-disk, and to synchronize with a rsync-like
protocol (rsync server would make it) that handles the compression in
the network protocol itself, and in turn that can apply compression to a
large blob (i.e. the diff between the trees), and not to the single tiny
files.
