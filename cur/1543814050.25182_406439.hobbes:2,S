What sort of interface is suitable? There's a swap_prefetch tunable that is a 
boolean but I could make that to be off=0, on=1, aggressive_prefetch=2 or 
something. Or did you have something else in mind?

It may not be immediately obvious, but free ram is required for swap prefetch 
to do anything so as to not have any negative effects on normal vm function. 
After updatedb runs ram is full thus swap prefetch does nothing 
unfortunately. You could certainly do some pointless "ram touching" to free 
up the cached ram in an updatedb script though, but that could evict 
something useful so I wouldn't recommend it.
Cheers,
