How many is too many? A function with 2 "if" means 3 tabs = 24 characters
for just indentation. Add a printk(KERN_DEBUG "\n"); and you can print
ca. 30 characters without having to break the string. This is crazy.

Well... I was forced to split functions making the code less readable
and more complicated just to avoid these 80-columns. A short function
with more indent levels may be way more readable than a redesigned one
with this requirement in mind.
I'd just state the code has to be readable and laid out with some sanity
but 80 columns give us nothing WRT this.
We already review new code and spot such problems (and smaller ones)
without using the 80-cols rule.
