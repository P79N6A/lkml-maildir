I totally agree.  (Note that syscall() is a libc-provided routine.
The kernel has nothing to do with it.)

Yes.  On ia64, I held off on getting rid of kernel-internal syscalls
entirely because I was too lazy to do kernel_thread().  However, a
while ago, there was a bug that forced us to implement kernel_thread()
via a direct call.  Lo and behold, the resulting code was not only a
lot faster, but it turned out to be short and clean, too.  Very likely
the situation would be similar for the other architectures that have
been holding off on implementing the kernel syscalls via direct calls.
