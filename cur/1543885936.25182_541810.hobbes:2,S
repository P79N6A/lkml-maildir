Yes. This patch shouldn't go in. There's no ambiguity in
Documentation/CodingStyle that it fixes anyway, only *imposes* a
"style", which:
(1) there is no consensus about *at all*, and
(2) blatantly goes against _all_ similar examples in K&R.
It's quite funny to worship them as "prophets" and adopt their style
for some stuff (with a simple "Rationale: K&R.") one instant and then
suggest a style completely opposite to theirs one screenful later in
the same file.
