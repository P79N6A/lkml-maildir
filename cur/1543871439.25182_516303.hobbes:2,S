my point is basically that we shouldn't waste any effort on a simple
driver while we actually need a generic driver interface. This generic
interface might be look simple and stupid in the beginning, but it can
easily grow over time. With this interface of course we need the concept
of a HID bus.

Maybe the report descriptor is broken. I have some Bluetooth HID where
they actually byte-swapped values and it totally confused the report
descriptor parser. For some devices it might be better to actually patch
the report descriptor instead of adding quirks to the HID core.
