Have you looked at the change in object code size? I would expect the
object code to actually become bigger. I also think that it hurts
readability rather than help it.
Maybe a better solution is to change the core dump code to not
require the mutex to be held in the first place. By the time
we get to call the get functions, it should already be in
saved state and no longer be able to get scheduled, so we might
not actually need all the extra tricks with avoiding the
mutex to be taken again.
