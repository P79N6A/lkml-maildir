We noticed this too, but got no responses about it.
Even if we haven't actually modified the file in any way (ie: open/seek/read/fscync/close) there are stalls at the fsync stage.
I don't have any of the stats handy.  I was told that it wasn't as bad on
2.1, but was still way slower than on any other UNIX we have db2 ported to.
