But should it stay suspended until explictely resumed? Do we have
consensus on that?

Yes.

No reason to make matters worse.

That and you are putting the latency/power choice into kernel space.
I've seen GPS recievers that need 30 seconds to get a fix. Autosuspend
needs to be in kernel space. But that doesn't mean that it is sufficient
as a mechanism nor that it doesn't need parameters supplied from
user space.

Yes. However, simple character devices are the first candidates for
libusb so kernel space is left with the hard cases.
