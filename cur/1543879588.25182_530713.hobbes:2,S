The transfer size in the URB is not limited by the maximum packet size.
The HC driver splits up the transfer as specified by URB into the required
number of packets.
I think you might want to write to linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
to discuss the specifics of what it mean "devices insisted on 1024".
I presume the devices didn't show up on your doorstep with baseball
bats to have a little chat. So there must be a specific failure symptom.
Until you share it, I don't see this patch going anywhere.
