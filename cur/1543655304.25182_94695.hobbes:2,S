Hi!
I'm using rh8 as a default distro. I've compiled 2.4.19 stock kernel,
everything works fine. With the same config options, I've compiled
2.4.20, but when I reboot the machine with the new kernel, the boot
process stops at starting iptables line, and nothing happens. When I
remove the iptables daemon with chkconfig, system boots fine, and when I
start the daemon by hand, it works. Neither 2.4.19 nore 2.5.50 has a
problem with the iptables daemon during startup. Has anybody met the
above situation?
