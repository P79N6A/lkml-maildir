Much more likely to be a hardware problem with Patrick's system.  I
and thousands of other people are using ext2 (little-endian) on PPC
with 2.2.x kernels with no problems at all.
Patrick, if you want to send me details of your system and the error
messages you are seeing, I'll have a look and see if I can see any
obvious problem.
