Yes.  They'll degrade very, very fast.  This is where Soft Update would
have an advantage.  Another issue here is we can't just slap a journal
onto vfat, for all those flash devices that we want to share with Windows.

Yeah, I never said you could cripple a disk with power problems.  You
COULD destroy a NAND in a flash device by nuking the thing with
10000000000000 writes to the same area.

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
