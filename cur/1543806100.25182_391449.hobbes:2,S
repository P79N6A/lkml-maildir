DMA-API.txt uses the enum form; so do arm, frv, mips, parisc and
powerpc. x86-64, IA64, alpha, sparc, sparc64 and v850 use the int
form. I really couldn't care less whether we use an enum or an int for
the DMA data direction in the DMA API, as long as all archs used the
same thing. I don't feel comfortable putting swiotlb.h in generic code
unless it really is generic. So... which should it be?
Cheers,
