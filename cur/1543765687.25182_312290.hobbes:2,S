Hello,
I'm having trouble reading from /dev/kmem in Linux 2.4.22 and 2.4.25. I 
have written some code available at 
http://vv.carleton.ca/~cat/misc/readidt.c.
 The behavior on both kernel 
versions is the following:
# ./readidt
idt: 0xffffe000 + 0x07ff
pointer at 0x00000000ffffe400
read: 0
As read returns 0, it seems as if it's reading past the end of file. 
However, the IDT must be present in the kernel's virtual memory. Also, 
looking at 2.4.20's read_kmem() (drivers/char/mem.c:215), I don't see how 
the function could return 0 unless count was 0.
It would be great if follow-ups could be CC'ed to my e-mail address.
Thank you very much for your time,
Catalin
