Surely it can be spit out.  E.g. hwgraph removal is separate from your
SAL call stuff which is separate from dma mapping.
And,  let me repeat:
     There is absolutely _NO_ interest in adding yet another non-standard
     prom interface for PCI configuration.  IA64 has a standard ACPI-based
     interface that everyone but SGI implementent.  Please implement that one
     in your firmware.

You have more subdirectories than everything else in arch/ia64/ combined,
go figure.
