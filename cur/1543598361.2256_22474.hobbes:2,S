Well, I tried this, and.... WOW!  Much better  [:)]
Was it really true, that swapped in pages didn't get marked as 
referenced before?  It almost felt that bad, but that seems kind of

P.S. I tried this on my 64Mb PPro and a 128Mb PIII, and both felt like 
they had a lot more memory - e.g. less swapping and stuff.
