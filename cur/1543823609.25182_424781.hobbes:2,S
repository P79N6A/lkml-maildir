Just because sgtools doesn't work with it doesn't mean there aren't
commands you can send through sg to work with it.

Do you know of a disk that can handle 1Gbit/s to the platter?  Or are
you planning to stripe this across multiple disks?
I would think a controller on a fast enough bus (plain PCI isn't going
to handle it), with enough drives in a raid setup of the right type
should probably handle it.  Might need to do a filesystem specially
designed for the streaming needs rather than general purpose file
storage.

Can you tell a DVD drive to stop retrying?  Perhaps you can.  I know
some of the retries are in software.
