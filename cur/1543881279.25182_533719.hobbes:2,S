With a blocksize of 4KB, a block group would be 128 MB. In the original
Chunkfs paper, Valh had mentioned 1GB chunks and I believe it will be
possible to use 2GB, 4GB or 8GB chunks in the future. As the chunk size
increases the number of cross-chunk references will reduce and hence it
might be a good idea to present these statistics considering different
chunk sizes starting from 512MB upto 2GB.
Thanks,
Kalpak.
