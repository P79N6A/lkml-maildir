Hi Gene,
Please keep this conversation on the LKML, where it started.

That's hardly helpful. If gkrellm doesn't tell you where the data comes
from, we just can't use it to debug any issue. Please use "sensors"
instead.

This is only one part of sensors-detect. I guess it then suggests the
w83627hf driver instead. Which driver are you using, w83627hf or
w83781d?
Please provide:
1* The complete output of sensors-detect.
2* The output of "sensors" in 2.6.15-rc5.
3* The output of "sensors" in 2.6.15-rc6.
4* The diff of your 2.6.15-rc5 kernel config file and 2.6.15-rc6
kernel config file.
Thanks,
