With 2.6.12.1 when the loopback device is being initialized, I get the
following:
RTNETLINK: answers: File exists
However, with 2.6.11.11, I don't get this.  I've searched the net via
google as well as the kernel archives, with no luck.  Could someone give
me a clue as to what I need to do to fix this?  My system is a Linux
From Scratch 6.0 plus BLFS updates.  Works without error with <=
2.6.11.11, but gives the above error with >= 2.6.12.  However, even with
this error, the system seems to be working just fine.
Please CC me as I'm not a member of this mailing list.
Thanks,
Steve
