Has this fix been reverted?  It isn't in -pre8 or -rc1.
net/network.o(.text.lock+0x17b8): undefined reference to `local symbols 
in discarded section .text.exit'
It's kind of impossible to compile the kernel at the moment (even the 
CONFIG_HOTPLUG fix mentioned doesn't work).
I tried downgrading binutils & it didn't work.. possibly I didn't go 
back far enough.  What is the newest version that is supposed to work?
