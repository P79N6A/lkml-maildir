I should have noted this in my original post but, yes, I have enabled DMA in
the kernel:
# grep DMA /usr/src/linux-2.4.17/.config | grep -v '#'
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ADMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
Thanks for the response.

You did build this kernel with DMA support in the kernel, right? For your
chipset? Vendor kernels have been known to err on the side of safty.
