I should probably have mentionned those:
Mar 13 06:33:58 pao kernel: EXT3-fs error (device rd(48,7)): ext3_get_inode_loc:
 bad inode number: 0
Mar 13 06:33:58 pao kernel: find_fh_dentry: 30:07/81921 dir/0 not found!
Mar 13 06:33:58 pao kernel: fh_verify: not found gumdrop.su.varesearch.com: exp 
30:07/81921 file (30:07/81921 dir 0) coookie 0xfeebbaca, generation 0x0
However those  aren't corruption  errors, they  were due  to a  knfs problem
where knfs would try to fetch inode 0 from disk. HJ added some debug info in
knfs and we found the client that was holding the bad filehandle

Ok: my logs say
(other partitions being mounted)

Is is correct to assume that the mounting fs with errors message applies to the mount entry immediately up in the log? If so, I don't get it because e2fsck
came out clean:
pao:~# e2fsck -fy /dev/rd/c0d0p7

No  software raid. I  don't know  about other  things that  could touch  the
buffers directly.

I'll have a look at it when it comes out.
