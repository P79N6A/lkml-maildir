Theres a patch floating around that does just that. Its an obvious
hack.  I would like to see something clean get into the mainstream
kernels.  Its a real pain not to have cores for threaded code.
It does work, however. It effectively dumps the thread that caused the
fault.  
(I have a complimentary hack that will dump the stacks of all the
rest of the threads as well (though its a good trick to get gdb to
interpret this). Available upon request.)
