Yes, however tiobench doesn't mix the two. The batch_expire helps
probably by giving longer batches between servicing expired requests.
The deadline-np-42 patch also eliminates corner cases in which requests
could be starved for a long time. A large batch_expire as in mm2 is not
a good solution without my anticipatory scheduling stuff though as
writes really starve reads.

I'm happy with that as long as they aren't too dependant on the phase of
the moon. The initial deadline scheduler had quite a lot of problems with
these workloads.
