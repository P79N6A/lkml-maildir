This default value is set to 300 ms. On my Xserver, the default value is 
660 ms and by default in my distrib it's set to 500 ms. So, indeed, the 
default value of the ati_remote is quite small. Maybe you could increase 
FILTER_MAX to 10 (= 600 ms) in order to have something saner?
That was my two cents :-)
See you,
Eric
