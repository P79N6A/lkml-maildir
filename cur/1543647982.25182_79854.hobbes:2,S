Actually no, but I consider a registration interface for partition handlers
a cleanup, but I must admit I am not up to date to 2.5.
Personally I would love to see the device mapper stuff as the foundation for
evms. Hopefully those teams may meet in the middle :)
I am afraid partition handling is most of the time needed for root file
systems, so this will put more need for initrd solutions into the picture.
