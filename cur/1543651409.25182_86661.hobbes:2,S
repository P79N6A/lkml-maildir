Richard, IMHO what Linus is trying to say is that he wants proof that problems
are solved using crash dumps by developers also outside of the corporations. He wants LKCD to have an audience before he wants to include it. Linus strongly
believes that "oops scribbles" en source code reading is his way of debugging the kernel and is sure of the fact that he doesn't need LKCD. But he leaves the
rest of the developpers free to use LKCD in problem solving. He leaves it up to Alan (for example) to include in a tree for audition. Once he is convinced 
enough that enough people (users/developers and also user/developer outside of
businesses) use it, I strongly believe he will merge LKCD into the mainstream
tree.
I for myself think crash dumps make life a lot easier in debugging the kernel. And not only for that, also for teaching the inner workings of the Linux kernel to students. Crash dumps are equivalent of coredumps for processes. You can see
the state of the machine at a given time.

TurboLinux advertised they used LKCD in their distro. Unfortunately the demo didn't contain LKCD.

I suggest the road to late 2.5 or early 2.6 is by turning left on Cox' road. But let's ask him. Alan?
