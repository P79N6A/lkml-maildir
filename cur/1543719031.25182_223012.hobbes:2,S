You are assuming that all uses of spin_lock_irq() are done when
interrupts are already enabled.  This _should_ be true, because the
matching spin_unlock_irq() will unconditionally reenable interrupts.
However I have seen buggy code where spin_lock_irq() was issued with
interrupts disabled.  By unconditionally passing X86_EFLAGS_IF, that
buggy code can now run in one of two states :-
state 1
Enter with interrupts disabled
Do some work
spin_lock_irq()
No lock contention, do not enable interrupts
Do some more work
spin_unlock_irq()
state 2
Enter with interrupts disabled
Do some work
spin_lock_irq()
Lock contention, enable interrupts, get lock, disable interrupts
Do some more work
spin_unlock_irq()
Your patch opens a window where data that was protected by the disabled
interrupt on entry becomes unprotected while waiting for the lock and
can therefore change.
It could be that I am worrying unnecessarily, after all any code that
calls spin_lock_irq() with interrupts already disabled is probably
wrong to start off with.  But it does need to be considered as a
possible failure mode.
