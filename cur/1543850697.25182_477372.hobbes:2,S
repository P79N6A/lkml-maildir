Hello Samuel,
with 2.6.18 parts of the patch failed:
acer01:/usr/src/linux# patch -p1 < ../irda_patch.txt
patching file net/irda/af_irda.c
Hunk #1 FAILED at 132.
Hunk #2 FAILED at 1213.
Hunk #3 FAILED at 1223.
Hunk #4 succeeded at 1356 with fuzz 2.
Hunk #5 succeeded at 1409 with fuzz 2.
3 out of 5 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file net/irda/af_irda.c.rej
This happens with 2.6.18.1 too. I haven't tried 2.6.19-rc... yet.
I've attached af_irda.c.rej for 2.6.18.
