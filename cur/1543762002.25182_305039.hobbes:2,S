Actually this is more correctly related to -RT-2.6.12-rc1-V0.7.41-08. 
This one boots on one of my SMP systems (dual 2.6 GHz Zeon)  doesn't on 
the other (dual PIII 933 MHz). Unfortunately not close to the one that 
doesn't boot right now so can't debug it at all.
Was still building on the UP box, but now that one seems to have gone 
down in flames. This system was running -RT-2.6.12-rc1-V0.7.41-00 while 
trying to build -RT-2.6.12-rc1-V0.7.41-07. :(
