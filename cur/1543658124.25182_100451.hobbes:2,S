I just got my power bill for this round.
Living in California, this just put me well into the 300% excess power
usage range :-(.
Now that things are settling down and out, and it is the sole issue of
distribution and some kind of screwy spin on what is a derived work.
The two briefs by Lawrence Rosen, about "Derivitive Works" and
"The Unreasonable Fear of Infection" blow holes into everyones arguement
the size of Mac Trucks.
There is a key phrase "contains or is derived from" v/s "combination".
Read the meanings folks and get a grip.
