Personally I fetch the .bz2 tar files for a few base kernel versions,
but I fetch the .gz patch files.
This is so that I can "zgrep" through the patch files looking for
which version changed some feature or API.
bzgrep exists, but it is way too slow.
So if there were only .bz2 patch files, I would fetch them and convert
them back into .gz files on my local mirror.
Which is ok of course, but then the signatures don't match any more.
Well, that's my really weak reason for liking .gz patches.
enjoy,
