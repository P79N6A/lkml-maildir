I noticed btw that there thing might (is likely to) spuriously trigger at 
WARN_ON(sacked != tp->sacked_out); because those won't be equal when SACK 
is not enabled. If that does happen too often, I send a fixed patch for 
it, yet, the fact that I print print tp->rx_opt.sack_ok allows
identification of those cases already as it's zero when SACK is not 
enabled.
Just ask if you need the updated debug patch.
