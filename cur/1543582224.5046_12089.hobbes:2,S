So by what ABI do you propose to pass array bounds to a called
function?  It sounds pretty ugly.  It also sounds like you will be
breaking the extremely useful C postulate that, at the ABI level at
least, arrays and pointers are equivalent.  I can't see *how* you plan
to work around that one.

Understatement of the year, if you really want to catch all cases.
