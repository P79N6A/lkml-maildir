Unfortunately, this is not the case :(  This happens to all TCP connections, inside and outside LAN,
also with the telnet session with the router. I also tried to manipulate MTU, but without any positive effect.
I also tried to change things like net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control -- which i figured out might affect TCP traffic, but also didn't get any results.
I'm afraid this can have something to do with IRQ, because the PCMCIA cards (my Atheros wireless card is such) are visible only with irqpoll kernel option.
Of course, as I mentioned, everything works fine with kernel 2.6.19; with the same servers etc.
Thank You for reply, best regards
