That's the problem with that right there - "with the right documentation".
The current boot system, you can *SEE* "oh, it wedged trying to bring up
the sound card".  No "Well, if the slider is all the way to the left and
the screen is half-dim, then it's the sound card, else if it's all the

you've also installed...."
