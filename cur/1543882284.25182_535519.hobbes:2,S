Lets look at some numbers. I'll just concentrate on the scatterlist,
since the bio_vec is smaller. On x86 32-bit, the scatterlist is 20 bytes
long. If we accept that 2^1 allocations are ok (they should be), then we
can support ~1.6mb ios just like that.
My approach would be to support scatterlist chaining. Essentially you'd
have the last element of the sglist pointing to the next array of
entries. We can then stick to 128 entry arrays which fit nicely in a
single page allocation and easily support >> 2mb ios. The only caveat is
that you'd need to update the drivers to get there, since a regular
iteration over the array isn't enough. My plan was to add an sglist
iterator helper that hides this from the drivers, if they need to loop
over the scatterlist. Things like {dma/pci}_map_sg() would of course be
updated.
The above can be implemented fairly cleanly, and on a need-to-have
basis. It's not something that'll break drivers.
What do you think?
