Yeah, that is a bit ugly.

It turns out that on Dec 18th laster year, HJ Lu fixed the gas bug
that prevented me from using the place-relative relocations.  I ended
up biting the bullet and making the bleeding edge assembler a
pre-requisite for building 2.5.59.  I try to avoid that, but in this
case, it was better than the alternatives.
Anyhow, it means that we don't need a separate type anymore for ia64.
Thanks,
