I should have added "replace it".

Evil optimization ;-)
[ s == o is memcmp(s, o, sizeof(that)) == 0]

Proposal would have been: char temp[sizeof("4294967296")];

There were some [or some function prototypes] above this point.

How do you mean? I was just suggesting to collapse the three [four] lines into
one, getting rid of the tempotemporaries in a lot of these functions,
for example,

static int smack_task_kill(struct stask_struct *p, struct siginfo *info,
    int sig, u32 secid)
{
	/* Comment */
	return smk_curacc(smk_of_task(p), MAY_WRITE);
}
