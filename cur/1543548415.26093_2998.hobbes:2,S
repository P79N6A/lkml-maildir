   Not so sure about NFSv3 server, since i haven´t pushed it that 
much, but as a NFSv2 server and client, and a NFSv3 client, it has 
proven itself to me. And i have a network comprised of about 40 
Solaris, Irix, Aix and Linux machines, running different releases of 
each operating system. While someone mentioned having 
considered Freebsd, more recently i have considered Solaris x86, 
due to the licensing changes. Not much of a performer in general, 
but it has solid NFSv2 and v3 from stock.

Shrug. So you want me to make it worse by shipping unproven 
code in a
way I can't test it ?
