Okay, but it seems like this is more of an argument that diffs
containing lines that change only the trailing whitespace are
considered harmful.  I buy that, but I don't see why it follows that
new code shouldn't have any trailing whitespace at all.

I don't get this part.  Only changes can create conflicts.  Are there
some editors (or MUAs) that change trailing whitespace without being
told to?  (And I'm not even talking about your warning about conflicts
created by applying stripped versions of early patches in a series -
that's just self-inflicted pain.)
