What I meant was to check for an oops and maybe then don't break out.
Otherwise let the system try to reclaim memory. Since this is locked
when the alloc_skb called with GFP_ATOMIC and fails.

In the kernel I would think that a poll would probe for an event and let
the system continue if the event hasn't arrived.  Not block all
activities until an event has arrived.

OK, this is more clear than what you said previously.  When I asked if
the system crashed, I should have asked if the system was crashing.  I
thought that you meant that you saw this in normal activity with no
oops.
So, if anything, this discussion has pointed out that the e1000 has a
problem with its netpoll.  I wrote an earlier patch, but since I don't
own a e1000, someone will need to test it, or at least check to see if
it looks OK.
