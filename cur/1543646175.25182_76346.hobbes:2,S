Got my two new Netgear GA302t nics today.  They seem to use the
tg3 driver....
I put them into the 64/66 slots on my Tyan dual amd motherboard..
Running kernel 2.4.20-pre8
eth2 is plugged into eth3 over cross-over cable.
The tg3 found and used them, mostly:
tg3.c:v1.1 (Aug 30, 2002)
eth2: Tigon3 [partno(AC91002A1) rev 0105 PHY(5701)] (PCI:66MHz:32-bit) 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet 00:40:f4:47:20:56
eth3: Tigon3 [partno(AC91002A1) rev 0105 PHY(5701)] (PCI:66MHz:32-bit) 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet 00:40:f4:47:22:fd
tg3: eth3: Link is up at 1000 Mbps, full duplex.
tg3: eth3: Flow control is off for TX and off for RX.

tg3: eth3: Link is up at 1000 Mbps, full duplex.
tg3: eth3: Flow control is off for TX and off for RX.
tg3: eth3: Link is down.
tg3: eth3: Link is up at 1000 Mbps, full duplex.
tg3: eth3: Flow control is on for TX and on for RX.
I tried to start traffic with pktgen, and the machine hangs solid.
The last thing I see is:
[root@localhost root]# tg3: eth2: transmit timed out, resetting
Any ideas?  Is this NIC supposed to work with tg3?
Thanks,
Ben
