The simplest example to follow would be reset_vma_truncate_counts() in
mm/memory.c: shp->shm_file->f_mapping gives you the struct address_space *
mapping to pass to vma_prio_tree_foreach().  Ignore the i_mmap_nonlinear
lines, you can't get nonlinear shm (because shm_vm_ops lacks .populate).
You'll need to spin_lock(&mapping->i_mmap_lock) first, spin_unlock after.
