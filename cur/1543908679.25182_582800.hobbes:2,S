Yes, they don't cause data corruption or anything like that,
but I still don't think the 390 people want to ship a kernel
that doesn't build -- and it seems they still need to support
GCC versions before 4.0.  Up until the day they can finally

...use the simple workaround, annoying as it may be, at least
it works.  That's all I'm saying.

The good news is that things are getting better since more and

Yeah, magnifying glass + lots of time kind of bug.  Lovely :-/
