  Hello,
     I have a few questions regarding the behavior of 2.2.5 and above
  during a hardware upgrade. The answers that I would be most happy to
  hear are "upgrade your hardware and everything will work just fine",
  but I am not very optimistic (call it a hunch ;-). It seems important
  to know the answers before buying new hardware, but I could not find
  them in FAQs or other online docs. E.g., SMP is typically covered 
  either from the developer's point of view, while I mainly care about
  not losing my system during upgrade and being able to run independent
  processes on difft processors (e.g., using make -j2) afterwards.
    If you believe my questions are not appriate for this list,
  I'd be happy to receive suggestions as to better places to post at.
  Pointers to relevant docs are also welcome.

    I am running an out-of-the box (no kernel rebuilds/upgrades)
  RedHat6.0 on a Pentium 150 w 96Mb RAM and a 3.2Gb HD.
    The upgrade is motivated by two factors 
      o the latest gcc/g++2.95.1 (
http://egcs.cygnus.com
) can finally
        compile my C++ code and I am not anymore confined to SunPro CC
        or MSVC++
      o our lab has a number of spare Pentium II/350 processors donated
        from Intel and the multi-proc. motherboards do not look too much
        pricier than uni-proc. ones.
   I plan to buy a motherboard for 2 or 4 processors, a new case and new
  memory (I've been told that my curr. 96Mb chips may not work well with
  new boards). I am going to keep the peripherals.
   The questions are
     1. I expect the current [binary] kernel to recognize a new
        motherboard and at least one new processor immediately after
        the upgrade. Will that work if the board has 2 or 4 processors
        installed?
  
     2. One of the 2.2 kernel reviews on the Web alluded to
        the possibility to turn SMP on w/o recompiling the kernel...
        is this really possible or was that my misunderstanding ?
     3. If I need to rebuild the kernel, I would also consider downloading
        a newer one before rebuilding. Since I do not have problems with 2.2.5
        running on one processor, I am curious if there are any advantages
        in getting a new kernel. I do seem to have one of those Ethernet
        cards that caused sudden death in combination w SMP, but I am not
        using it since I have no Ethernet connection.
     4. Any comments on choosing 2-processor vs 4-processor motherboard?
        (Since I am going to use the processors for faster builds, it seems
        I should be able to use 4 processors w no problem).
   thanks,
     
								Igor
