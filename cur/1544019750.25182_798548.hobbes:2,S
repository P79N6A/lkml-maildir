Hmmm, I should know not to try to read code when I'm that sleepy.  Had
myself convinced that the condition was wrong...

by "vma is anon vma only", do you mean that the vma being tested--e.g.,
that we found to be VM_LOCKED--no longer has the page mapped in it's
page tables?  That is it's purpose--to detect this condition.  IIRC, Rik
added it during testing of the mlock patches when we discovered we were
mlocking pages because

right.  that's why we don't have the page_mapped_in_vma() check in
try_to_unmap_file().

Well, they're not exactly "unrelated"--vmas attached to an anon_vma are
from the same "family".  Any pages that haven't been COWed will still be
mapped into multiple mm's.
My question last night about try_to_unmap_one() wasn't really related to
the mlock statistics glitch.  Sorry I wasn't more clear about this.  I
was wondering about the case where shrink_page_list was trying to unmap
a page whose vma was on an anon_vma list with other VM_LOCKED vmas that
didn't actually map the page.  However, in the early morning light, I
see that the call to page_check_address() handles this.
----------
Anyway, our original responses to this report crossed in the mail.  You
said you'd handle it.  So, in the meantime, I'm looking at the
mmap()/vm_merge()/mlock_vma_pages_range() issue reported yesterday.
