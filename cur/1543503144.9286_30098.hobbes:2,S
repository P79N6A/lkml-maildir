I agree.  I have actually been hoping to get all these together.  I think
they should comprise a big clone overhaul patch.  Anyone want to volunteer
to maintain the conglomerate until its done?  I'll do it if no one has any
preference.  I've already got my stuff and Ulrich's stuff.  And I am
playing with a few new ideas, too.

I'm not trying to scatter efforts.  My stuff just got coded yesterday :)  I
agree completely with what you say about 1 patch.  As for Pthreads, Ulrich
- you have some say in the glibc maintaining, correct?
