With my knowledge, I expected exactly that.

I am not. The DMA ioctl() finishes before the close() -> free happens after
the hexdump and the DMA. The buffer is allocated in open. The fact that I get
the same buffer again next time shows that the free is sucessful and
effective, right?

My problem is, I'm out of ideas. All I can think of is describe as much as
possible the relevant things that I do and the things that occur. Maybe
someone more experienced recognizes a principal flaw in the concept.

And I can rely on the fact that all the 2 MB are contig memory without
holes, right? It's completely mine, isn't it?
Or is it perhaps illegal to let the mem usage pump?
Should I better allocate the mem in init_module() instead of rsc_open()?
Probably page tables are more likely to get corrupted than they would be if
I allocate only once. Or do I have to use a spin_lock somewhere in the nopage
method?

I'm not so sure all the 
(1 << 9) pages really are.
If I don't access the pages, just allocate them and free them after some
time, I never saw any instabilities. But it seems that as soon as I access pages
above the 1st in the buffer, something gets corrupted. So maybe today it's
only legal to allocate 1 page at a time and I have to do that 
(1<<10) times...
Or maybe some of the VM trouble I read about recntly would also cover my
problems?
Thanks,
