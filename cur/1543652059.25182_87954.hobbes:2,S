Don't use SSH then, or any SSL derivative.  They only use public key 
cryptography at the start of the session, primarily to exchange a pair of 
symmetric keys, which are then used to encrypt the bulk data transmitted 
during the rest of the session.
Public key cryptography is computationally expensive.  Symmetric key 
cryptography is quick and easy, and provably breakable only by brute force if 
you know they haven't got the key.
And of course, the data you're transmitting is itself a shared secret, isn't 
it?  At the end of the session, anyway.  That's the whole point.

You can have security without privacy?
How?
Privacy is "necessary but not sufficient" to security.  All cryptography boils 
down to there being something you don't want somebody else to know.
