Btw, what you can always do is just
	git pull <other-end>
	.. look at the result ..
	git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
and you should be ok. It's obviously not a dry-run, it's more of a "do it 
and then undo it", but hey, it should _work_.
(Look out for dirty state, though. "git pull" will happily pull into a 
dirty tree if the changes don't actually affect any dirty files. The "git 
reset --hard" thing will undo all dirty state, though).
