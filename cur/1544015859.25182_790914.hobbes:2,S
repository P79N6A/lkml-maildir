Well it's something like 3 instructions versus one. You would
have a hard time benchmarking it unless you run it in a very tight 
loop. It will be lost in the noise compared to all the other costs
of the IPI.
Also why i don't like this patch is that on the typical small single/dual
core system running a 128 byte cache line distro kernel you always pay the 
1K cost now, while with per cpu it only needed one/two entries.
Admittedly it could have been better commented.
Not that it matters now unfortunately it's already applied. Sometimes
wonder why I still bother to do patch review...
