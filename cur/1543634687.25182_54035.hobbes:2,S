Hmmh, it seems all three errors you get are related to the same problem: I 
don't know the proper command how to create a gnu patch from my bk tree.
Anyway, so now there's a version 3 which I diffed manually. Still has the
warning for "make clean", but should work.
(I couldn't help but wonder: Is three tries enough to get it right?)
