Andrew,
Please throw away the following 4 patches in 2.6.13-mm1:
  cpusets-oom_kill-tweaks.patch
  cpusets-new-__gfp_hardwall-flag.patch
  cpusets-formalize-intermediate-gfp_kernel-containment.patch
  cpusets-confine-oom_killer-to-mem_exclusive-cpuset.patch
You will see almost the same patches come back at you, in another
week, after I first send some patches to rework handling the global
cpuset semaphore cpuset_sem.
My code reading leads me to think there is a rare lockup possibility
here, where a task already holding cpuset_sem could try to get it
again in the new cpuset_zone_allowed() code.
Only systems actively manipulating cpusets have any chance of seeing
this.
