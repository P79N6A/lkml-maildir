You're talking about a different problem there.  Creating a thread within a
realistic time-limit for a sensible number of threads is not a bad idea.
Doing it for a huge number of threads may not be something that has to be
done right away.  Don't screw up the low to middle-end - that trend is
getting frightening in Linux.
} sorry, but creating a new thread within some realistic time limit,
} independently of how all the other threads are layed out, is not something
} i'd give up trying to solve.
