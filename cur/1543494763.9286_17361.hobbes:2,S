No it does not. It means, exactly what it says. It says that the
type is that of the left operand (promotion rules) and the value
is the value stored in the left operand after the assignment has
taken place. It says nothing more.

No. It does not say that at all.

Even 'gcc' knows that the operation is incorrect, but you have to
turn on -Wall.
