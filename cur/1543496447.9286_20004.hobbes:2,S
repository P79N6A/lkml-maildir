No. Since you don't let root log in, anything owned by UID 0 is safe.
You can even leave root all-powerful for startup-script compatibility.
(Irix has capabilities, but it leaves root all-powerful. We can do that.)

Either setuid-root or some other filesystem-specific feature specified at
mount time. One might trust all files on read-only media.

Yes. I'd like to see separate capabilities for:
a. chown file to a UID held by the current process
b. chown file to any non-zero UID
c. chown file to 0
Then add "chown file from" and "set setuid on" versions of the above.

This problem is hard to solve. I suggest something more like "true"
or "real" capabilities. Either the executable has a list of files
that it can access, or the files have lists of executables that can
access them. I suggest supporting both, since the optimal choice for
performance and storeage space will vary.

This choice depends on what your goal is. Do you want to create insanely
secure systems that only an NSA sysadmin could handle? Do you want to
help protect newbie admins who only weakly understand permissions?
You must have some goal in mind. Here is mine:
Create security enhancements that Red Hat can enable by default.
This means NFS support is important. Newbie admins should not need to
worry about anything, but expert admins should have some flexibility.
It should be possible to admin the system without a root account.
Even better, root daemons and normal setuid-root executables should not
be needed. Normal software (Oracle, BRU, Stronghold) should run.
It would also be very nice to meet C2 or B1, shutting up M$ and *BSD.

Linux drops the setuid bit when an executable is modified.

This is why I keep suggesting an extra set of capability bits that
specifies what the minimum requirement is. Execution should just fail.
(maybe log the attempt too)
