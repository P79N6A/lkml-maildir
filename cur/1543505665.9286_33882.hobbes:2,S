[wakeup before sleep problem]
Try using a short circular buffer for the data and modify your

  move the above line into the ISR and modify like this:
  down(&datasem);
  cbuf[tail++] = inb (ioport);
  if (tail > MAX_ELEMENTS) tail=0; /* that's, why it's circular ;) */
  up(&datasem);
  
  wake_up_interruptible(&wait_q);
  /* check for ringbuffer overflows here! Delete the oldest
   * element, if overflow and count it as an error.
   */
  
and in your read function sth. like this
   down(&datasem);
   if (head != tail)
      data = cbuf[head++];
   else
      /* your reader EAGAIN as an error if in O_NONBLOCK */
   if (head > MAX_ELEMENTS) head=0; /* that's, why it's circular ;) */
   up(&datasem)
You can even readout the whole buffer or at least as much as fits
into of the buffer given to your read file operation.
   remain = buflen; /* 3rd parameter of fops->read */
   count = 0;
   /* "*userbuf" is the 2nd parameter of fops->read 
    * and valid for writing "buflen" bytes into it 
    */
   down(&datasem);
   while (remain && head != tail) {
      userbuf[count++] = cbuf[head++];
      if (head > MAX_ELEMENTS) head=0; /* that's, why it's circular ;) */
      remain--;
   };
   up(&datasem)
My solution is _NOT_ considered optimal, but should work. I
assumed, that your "cbuf" is a _byte_ buffer and that you return
"count" as a result.

Hmm, you better design your hardware to have it wait (may be
still collecting data into a small FIFO?) until you ack the
interrupt or read the data inside the ISR _before_ you ack the
interrupt to the PIC[1] (as I suggested).

No, this is IMHO the wrong direction for solving your problem.
Hope this helps a bit and works ;)
