Four adapters need to produce data to a 
descriptor queue which is consumed by a
user process. A lock mechanism was implemented
to sync the adapters. However, this causes 
a performance hit.  Is it possible to use
CMPXCHG on Intel's i-386 to avoid the locking?
Where can I find some doc and some sample code?
Thx
