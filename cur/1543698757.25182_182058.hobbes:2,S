Understood and that's what we disagree.
By the way, what's so different between code and data, anyway?
Are inline functions more important than macros and defs?

We have. Some malloc function as I remember, and has been removed from
current Linux sources.

You are trying to hide the fact that the kernel "sources" actually
contained copyrighted code.
Binary modules do not _contain_ copyrighted (GPL'ed) code, they merely
_include_ it (by #inlucde), but the _compiled_ binary modules contain
compiled copyrighted (GPL'ed) code.
So you are saying, binary modules contain compiled GPL'ed code, so it's
derived work of GPL'ed code. But kernel sources contained copyrighted
(non-GPL'ed) code, but the sources were not derived work of that code,
only the compiled form was?
