The document shows some interesting points though:
- They describe what they did to make redhat/apache perform better
- ISAPI is pretty fast compared to CGI (Didn't apache recently release a
programming interface which is cross platform and does something like
this too?)
- Multithreading works in their advantage (Compare 2003 normal against
multithreaded, maybe too little amount of apache threads running, or
some optimization needed in the linux kernel here?)
And last but not least:
WIndows 2003 suddenly realizes that is has a few CPU's left and starts
using them (-: See the graphs where there is a weird bent in the 8 CPU
curve.
And it still doesn't matter actually: 286% faster is still about 3 times
more expensive, which is the point on which is must be compared (lower
TCO because we are faster, so MS TCO is lower, but still too high)
