This isn't a useful interface for CardBus/hot-swap-PCI, which means that
there will be two interfaces.  Nor does it have support for the common
single-irq/single-base-addr case, which is a source of #ifdef trees.

The subsystem IDs check is needed.  There are a slew of ISA designs that
have been updated using a family of PCI bus interface chips.  The primary
IDs are all the same, and the subsystem ID identifies the board.  On some
Ethernet adapters the subsystem ID identifies the transceiver type in use.
Matching the subsystem ID also reduces the motivation for Taiwanese board
vendors to butcher the driver.  (Yes, I have multiple stories..)
The revision ID and drv_flags field allows drivers to concentrate naming and
capability information into a single table.  The 21142, 21143, 21143-TC and
21143-TD all have the same primary ID, but have different names and feature
sets.  The first yellowfin chip revision had an Rx filter bug that was fixed
in all other versions.
Of course all of these subsytem and revision checks can be done later, but
then why have a common scan in the first place?  Combining the naming and
capability information makes it much easier to update the driver with a new
chip type or name.

Not on older kernel versions.

If you have hairy and irregular things to do with your PCI configuration
space, you are better off not trying to use a table-driven approach.
Making an interface that can handle every theorized weird case will result
in a something more complex than the original problem.
Our goal should be to distill the common cases to their essential differences.

There is a fundamental conflict in specifying device order and supporting
dynamically inserted devices.

You patch means the driver still needs an #ifdef tree for many aspects of
the PCI scan interaction.
