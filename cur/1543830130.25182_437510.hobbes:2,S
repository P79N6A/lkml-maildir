Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Enable extra optimisations on fcntl(F_UNLCK) requests on NFS

Hi,
The following set of patches enables the NFS client to determine more
accurately whether or not it needs to send an NLM/NFSv4 unlock request
if the process has outstanding posix or flock locks:
The current heuristic just assumes that if inode->i_flock is non-null, then
we should always spam the server with an unlock request upon close().
The patchset introduces a new flag to the posix_lock_file()/flock_lock_file()
interfaces that tells them to return -ENOENT if an F_UNLCK request results in
no action.
Cheers,
  Trond
