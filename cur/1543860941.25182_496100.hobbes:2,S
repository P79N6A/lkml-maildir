I guess I don't have a problem with this going into -mm and making its way
upstream sometime after the next release.
I would normally say it is OK to stay for another year because it is so
unintrusive, but I don't like the fact it doesn't give one an explicit ref
on the page -- it could be misused slightly more easily than find_lock_page
or find_get_page.
Anyone object? Otherwise:
