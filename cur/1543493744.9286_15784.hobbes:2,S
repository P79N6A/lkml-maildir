If the load is high enough it doesn't matter, because there will
be always enough connections to be returned to an accept after a wakeup.
If it isn't the threads pool should adapt and use less threads which
avoids the problem (and a few lost wakeups in the transitions don't harm, 
because the machine has enough free cycles).
Do you have any real data that this doesn't happen?
