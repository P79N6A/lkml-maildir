Ick ick ick.  We don't like ioctls for the very reason they aren't type
safe, and you can pretty much stick anything in there you want.  So
let's not try to add the same type of interface to another subsystem.
How about we add the exact explicit functionality that you want, one
function per "type" of operation, like all other subsystems have.
thanks,
