but that's the point of allowing the threading of the timer interrupt. 
If you _have_ an interrupt source (and task) that _is_ more important
than the timer interrupt then so be it. Yes, the accuracy of timekeeping
may suffer.
so everything is relative, and the user decides which functionality
should have the better latency. do_offset() can take up to 10 usecs so
it's a latency source i'd like to keep out of the direct IRQ path, as
much as possible.

by default the timer interrupt has the highest priority, and you can
still change it to prio 99 to avoid any potential impact from RT tasks
or other interrupt threads.
