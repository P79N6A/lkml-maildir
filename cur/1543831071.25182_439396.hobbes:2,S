I don't quite see the point because on x86 the PMU doesn't run
during C states anyways. So you get idle excluded automatically.
And on the other hand a lot of people especially want idle
accounting too and boot with idle=poll. Your explicit 
code would likely defeat that.

Also x86-64 has idle notifiers for this if you really wanted
to do it properly.
