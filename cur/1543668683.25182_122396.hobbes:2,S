Subject: 2.5.66-mm3: acpiphp_glue.c must depend on CONFIG_ACPI_BUS

This is most likely neither new nor specific to -mm:
It seems drivers/hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c depends on CONFIG_ACPI_BUS 
and/or similar options but this isn't expressed in the Kconfig file 
(this compile error occurs with CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY enabled):

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
