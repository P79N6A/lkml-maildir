Attached an image here so you can see whats happening. One pixel are 2 seconds. You can see a small 
speed-up before the slow-down. This is where I changed lower_zone_protection from 1024 to 0. So it 
seems its speeding up until the memory is full. Then it drastically slows-down until I set it to 
1024 again. then it goes up slowly but not linear (interesting smoothly) until it peaks again at 82 
MB/Sec.
PS: 82 MB/sec is not our bandwidth-limit. It still peaks there. Dont know why. Certainly not the 
drives. They work up to 200 MB/Sec (10 drives there).
