Please keep the 2.95 support I use to use a lot, on not new hardware.
If you have old hardware with not much resources gcc 2.95 works just fine and 
fast, even you build the main kernel on other machine, by compatibility 
issues one or two drivers should be builded a lot of times into the older 
hardware, then we are forced to build gcc 3.4 or something like.
