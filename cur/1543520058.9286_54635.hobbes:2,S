      DaveM, does this look reasonable? I've noticed
   pdev_assign_unassigned_resources() being passed min_io and min_mem
   arguments, but I think we should just adjust resources of the
   parent bus instead.
I don't care as I don't use any of the generic bus resource assignment
walking code, this way when it changes my port doesn't break
needlessly.  I can never use the generic code until various
assumptions (unsigned char irq types, etc.) are removed from that
code anyways.
Later,
