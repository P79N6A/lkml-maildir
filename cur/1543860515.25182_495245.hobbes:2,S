c0156ec0 <pipe_poll>:
I used the config I original sent you to rebuild it again. This time I've put 
up the whole vmlinux for both kernels, the config is replaced, the 
decompilation is re-done, I've confirmed the offset in the GCC 4.1.1 kernel 
is identical. Sorry for the confusion.
The reason I changed the configs was to experiment with enabling and disabling 
debugging (and other such) options that might have shaken out compiler bugs.
However none of these kernels have ever crashed gracefully again, most of them 
hang the machine (no nmi watchdog though) so I've not been able to look at 
the oops. It's the same root cause, however, as GCC 3.4.6 kernels do not 
crash.

Happy new year, btw.
