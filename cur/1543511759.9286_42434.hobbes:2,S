You ask the user where her kernel sources are?
Most of the workstations over here run kernels that I compiled on a
server. The workstations don't have the kernel source. The server does,
but it in turn runs a different kernel.
So any third-party module that can't easily be pointed to a kernel
source tree is of no use to me.
