Maybe the use of stat() will show whether a file really exists.

Unrelated to this issue, I had a look into reiser3 for some other project of
mine. What I've found was that upon renaming() a file, the old entry is marked
invisble first, and then the new one is marked visible.
You would need to meet a lot of conditions to have a file lost (IMO):
- using reiser3
- reiserfs_rename() is suspended for as long as 5 scans
  (only happens either on SMP or UP+preempt)
- reiserfs_rename() hangs... somwhat, because while(i<5){while(readdir(...)){}}
  usually takes longer than a rename
