We are writing an application that will be creating a large number
of tcp connections.  What we need to know is:
How many tcp sockets (outgoing and incoming) can a process create/manage?
and (on an unrelated note):
Is there a way to adjust the amount of time an un-ACKed SYN will remain in
the queue to be processed?  
We are trying to reduce our vulnerability to SYN floods and along with syn
cookies and increasing the tcp_max_syn_backlog, we would like to set an
upper bound on the amount of time linux will wait for a host to respond to
the syn acknowledgement.  Is there a way to do this?  It appears that, by
default, a SYN will stay in the queue for several minutes before being
dropped - we'd like to set it to something like 30 seconds.
We're using 2.2.14.  
Thanks in advance,
Matthew Zito
