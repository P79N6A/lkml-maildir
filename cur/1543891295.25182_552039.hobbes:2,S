let me explain it to you:
1) there is absolutely no problem here to begin with. If a rare 
architecture is lazy enough to not bother implementing a finegrained 
sched_clock() then it certainly does not care about the granularity of 
lockstat fields either. If it does, it can improve scheduling and get 
more finegrained lockstat by implementing a proper sched_clock() 
function - all for the same price! ;-)
2) the 'solution' you suggested for this non-problem is _far worse_ than 
the granularity non-problem, on the _majority_ of server systems today! 
Think about it! Your suggestion would make lockstat _totally unusable_. 
Not "slow and functional" like you claim but "dead-slow and unusable".
in light of all this it is puzzling to me how you can still call Peter's 
code "non-functional" with a straight face. I have just tried lockstat 
with jiffies granular sched_clock() and it was still fully functional. 
So if you want to report some bug then please do it in a proper form.

Easy: it's not mandatory, but it's certainly "nice" even today, even 
without lockstat. It will get you:
 - better scheduling
 - better printk timestamps
 - higher-quality blktrace timestamps
With lockstat, append "more finegrained lockstat output" to that list of 
benefits too. That's why every sane server architecture has a 
sched_clock() implementation - go check the kernel source. Now i wouldnt 
mind to clean the API up and call it get_stat_clock() or whatever - but 
that was not your suggestion at all - your suggestion was flawed: to 
implement sched_clock() via the GTOD clocksource.
