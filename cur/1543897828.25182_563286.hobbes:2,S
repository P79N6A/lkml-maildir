unsigned long and unsigned long long have the same size, precision
and alignment on all LP64 arches, that's true.  But they have
different ranks and more importantly they mangle differently in C++.
So, whether some user exposed type uses unsigned long or unsigned long long
is part of the ABI, whether that's size_t, uintptr_t, uint64_t, u_int64_t
or any other type, you can't change it without breaking the ABI.
