0x5104 is a different can of worms from the other stuff you guys were
reporting.
5104 (status register = 0x51, error register 0x04) is the all-encompassing
"command abort" which is what the drive does any time you issue a command
with bad parameters, an invalid (immoral?) command, or some of the security
stuff out of sequence.  Most commonly it is seen attempting to enable
features on a drive that doesn't support them.

Hello!
It doesn't work. I still get:
hda: task_no_data_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: task_no_data_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
I'll try Dany's hint.
