The patch fixes a possible user-triggerable system lockup or memory leak.
In both cases it's a local DoS.
BTW, the CVE folks have decided to track this as two separate issues:
CVE-2006-1860 - the system lockup
CVE-2006-1859 - the memory leak

Assigning any official severity is a bit of a slippery slope, but
making sure it's clear what type of issue (i.e. local DoS in this case)
is very reasonable.
