I checked the USB MSI problem above(also has reported to our hardware
team),
the cause seems same as our SB700 SATA controller MSI problem.
I also did some small USB MSI debug on our SB700 board with 2.6.23-rc5:
The USB part of the second patch(attached at the end of this mail)
does not work for SB700 USB EHCI/OHCI controllers, no matter INTx is
enabled or disabled before enter MSI. The USB host controllers are
always using IO-APIC, which is different from SB400. I don't know why.
[root@localhost ~]# cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       CPU1  
17:          0        133   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ohci_hcd:usb1,
ohci_hcd:usb2, ehci_hcd:usb6
18:          1          2   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ohci_hcd:usb3,
ohci_hcd:usb4, ohci_hcd:usb5
19:          0          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ehci_hcd:usb7
Also I wonder why the USB MSI patch is not added into kernel at last?
Will it lead to other bugs?
Thanks
Best Regards
Shane
