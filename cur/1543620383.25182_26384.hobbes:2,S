I'm not so sure.  What if we can't _know_ how long the lock will be held
because we don't know the status of the holder?  What if _he_ is
sleeping on some other lock or their are a lot of contending processes?
Certainly I agree, we need to put forth effort into designing things
right and with a minimal amount of lock held time.

Agreed, this is much too much ;-)
