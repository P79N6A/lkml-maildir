There is some truth in that.  You aren't allowed to allocate new pages
in the swap space currently being removed however.  The current swap
off code removes pages from the current swap space without breaking
any sharing between swap pages.  Depending on your load this may be
important.  Fixing swapoff to be more efficient while at the same time
keeping sharing between pages is tricky.  That under loads that are
easy to trigger in 2.4 swapoff never sleeps is a big bug.

O.k. so at some point you actually wait for I/O and other process get
a chance to run.  On the larger machines we never wait for I/O and
thus never schedule at all.
The problem is now understood.  Now we just need to fix it.
