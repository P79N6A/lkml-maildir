How is it insecure for a process to agree to allow a cap to be inheritied
especially if it can be further filtered out by the executible file 
itself? For root processes you *can* get the compatible behavior of having
caps inherite in a understandible way without api changes in the execs.
for non-root cap-enhanced processes you can inherite caps to your
children; however they must explicitly allow those caps to again be
inheritied.
Right now if root is running everything all caps get inheritied.
In the future a new smart app can fine-tune what gets inheritied.
A dumb semi-legacy root cap-enhanced process will leak only a subset of
all caps iff it is set in compatiblity mode. a dumb non-root cap-enhanced
process will leak nothing.

+               cap_clear(current->cap_inheritable);
Will cause non-root to clear their pI upon exec. This forces someone who
has already strayed from legacy behavior to deal with a potential
incompatibility, but allows rooters to behave in a more compatible way.
Also note the SECURE_NOROOT thing, probably should be:
 if (issecure(SECURE_NOROOT)||current->euid)
We can cause the behavior to be more secure.
I am hashing around ideas to make securebits potentialy a per process
thing that can't override a global default.
I might also play with adding new SECURE_foo types.

I think that my model can support good compatible behavior for legacy apps
and provide enough room for new-apps to take advantage of the new
environment.
Might it be possible for you to offer more criticism than
"Sometimes, to be secure, you have to break compatibility." ?
What is exactly is the flaw(s)?

Myself I log in as root every once in a while so I don't forget my passwd.
Runs with so little intervention, that I can tend to put too much time
inbetween my needing to log in as root.
I think that is uninteresting I'm more concerned about daemons and suids
etc.
Anyway thanks I'll update my patch to fix the pI droping better.
