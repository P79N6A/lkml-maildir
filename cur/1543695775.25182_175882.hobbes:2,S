Been trying with 2.4.20, 2.4.22, 2.6.0-test9, how the heck do I get this 
to work?
I set everthing up on /dev/shm type tmpfs, then 
cd /dev/shm
mkdir initrd
pivot_root . initrd
So yay, it's set up so that the cd is pointed to by a lotta links in 
tmpfs, and the stuff that needs to be rw (like /etc) is on the tmpfs.
That's good.
Of course, the kernel unmounts / and then swears that it can't find init 
when the linuxrc exits.
The documentation says that linuxrc should pivot_root to the real root in 
Documentation/initrd.txt so I thought that's what the script sholud do.  
Apparently the doc is bad/old.
Any ideas?
script follows.
====/linuxrc
#!/bin/sh
