You are scaremongering a bit here. Several of the sys_* functions
*are* generic, and could be called by quite safely by the kernel. Look
for instance at the use of sys_close() by the binfmt stuff.
Normally, though, there will be a price to pay in terms of an
overhead.
Furthermore, if you find that you absolutely *have* to use the sys_*
interface, from userspace you will probably want to rethink your
design: after all you can call all those sys_* functions from user
space, and the rule of thumb is that if you *can* do something in user
space, you ought to do it there...
