Define "new" and "old" in this case. I don't believe you can give a
precise definition or that such a thing is physically possible.

The hardware itself has buffers at both ends of the link, there may be
buffers in modems, muxes and the like as well. We can certainly flush
input buffers in the kernel but it isn't clear we can always do so at the
hardware level, let alone at the remote end or buffers on devices on the
link.
