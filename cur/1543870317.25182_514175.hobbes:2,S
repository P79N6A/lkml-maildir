It is not _my_ networking, but taht one you use everyday in every Linux
box. Notice which tricks are used to remove single byte from sk_buff.
It is called optimization, and if it does us a single plus it must be
implemented. Not all people have magical fear of new things.

Ugh? :)

Is it enough for you?
epoll           4794.23 req/sec
kevent          6468.95 req/sec
And we are not saying about other kevent features like ability to
deliver essentially any event through its queue or shared ring (and a
some of its ideas are being slowly implemented in syslet/threadlet code,
btw).
Even if kevent is as fast as epoll, it allows to work with any kind of
events (signals, timers, aio completion, io events and any other you
like) with one queue/ring, which removes races and does _simplofy_
development, since there is no need to create different models to handle
different events.

That was compared to epoll, not kevent.
But I repeat again - kevent is not only epoll, it can do a lot of ther
things which does improve performance and simplify development - did you
saw terrible hacks in libevent to handle signals without race in polling
loop? It is not needed anymore completely - one event loop, one event
structure, completely unified interface for all operations.
Some kevent features are slowly being implemented in syslet/threadlet
async code too, and it looks like I see where things will end up :), but
likely I do not care about new 'kevent', I just wanted that that was
said half a year ago, when I started its resending again, but Ingo
already said his definitive word :)
