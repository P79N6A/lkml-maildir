Ofcourse you realize that setting -m to 1 or worse, 0, will result
in a badly fragmented disk when it fills up and really bad performance.
The reason that 5% of disk space is reserved is to always have some
room left. The ext2 allocation algorithm needs this to prevent fragmentation.
The -b 4096 is good advice though, it should be the default on partions
bigger than 100 MB or so. -i 16384 also isn't bad if you don't plan on
storing lots (and that is _lots_) of small files.
