Bzzzt wrong anser. Hibernation stops the entire kernel. checkpoint restart
stops processes, saves the entire state of the process. hibernation
is just halt the processor.

doesn't work - remember once the kernel is suspended it can't tell
another system that is has done so.
A full checkpoint/restart can potentially allow a process to migrate
from one node to another. It also allows other processing to be done
while the process is checkpointed:
	a. how do you reconstruct a software raid 5 while the system
	   is "suspended"
	b. how do you migrate to a different platform if the system is
	   suspended
Answer - you can't.
