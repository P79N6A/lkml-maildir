Bad spotting. :)
I donnot reveal the vendor because the last time I did so I have had to 
deal will unnecessary noise.

Note that ISA is officially PC99/00-dead, IIRC, so this will perhaps
become for you as simple as PCI in some near future. :-)

Pure PCI seem a lot more clean that the ISA/IDE inheritance with regards
to silicon we may have to deal with. 
I am just wondering about how and why ingenieers decided not to follow the
standard for PCI. They may just not have read or not have understood the
specs or perhaps based their design rather on stolen documents from their
concurrents instead of just following available specifications. :-) Or
may-be, it has unfortunately been the same PCI-skimed guys that moved from
one company to another and that, each time, missed to learn to read. ;-)

If we assume that all PCI-HOST bridges that are used with X86 hardware are
all fine (I mean that we just don't care about those that are not so ;) ),
then the number of remaining bridges (used on non-X86 systems) we can get
documentation about should not be that large. 
No documentation means not supported or just finger-crossed support and no 
more.
