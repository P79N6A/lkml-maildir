I thought so too originally, but it wasn't. My original thinking
was that logical must be faster because it can in theory send less messages
on large systems.
On the two CPU case it is basically always the same anyways because
the loop is very cheap compared to the IPIs (IPIs tend to be thousands
of cycles). for_each_cpu_mask is essentially just BSF with some glue.
For the > 2 CPU case it is not that obvious -- in theory the hardware
could optimize it to be more efficient, but it doesn't seem to. Or at least
not in a good enough way to show significant differences.

The IO-APIC delivery mode that is configured comes from genapic, and should be 
physical for physflat unless I'm totally confused about the code.

I disagree.  I think we should just use physical mode everywhere,
except on the old i386 systems.

It isn't inferior as far as I know.
