numa api has a "prefered node", which is a bit similar to the old
home node. The main difference is that it does not affect the scheduler,
only the memory allocation. You can of course affect the scheduler too,
but that's a separate option now and more strict.
For historical reasons numactl still has a --homenode= alias for --prefered,
although it is undocumented and discouraged now.
