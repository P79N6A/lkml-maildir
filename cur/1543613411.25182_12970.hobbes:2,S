Subject: Question regarding limit on the number of sockets?

I apologize if this is a FAQ, but I have not been able to find the
answer to a question that was asked of me.  According to the person who
asked, there is a limit on the number of sockets that can be open at a
given time.  The person stated that this limit was 1024.  My questions
are:
1.  Is this a per process limit, a per user limit, or a system wide
limit?
2.  Does this limit apply to both the 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels?
3.  Is this limit tunable (either by patching the kernel or otherwise)?
I wouldn't bother asking here, but I need an answer quickly for my boss
and thus far, my searching has not turned up the answer.
Thanks in advance for any help that you can provide me.
