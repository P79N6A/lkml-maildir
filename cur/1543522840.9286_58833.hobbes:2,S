You don't have to change the Linux IP stack for that: RTSP and RTP are
just protocols that run on top of any IP stack, no need for changes.

RealPlayer G2 is able to use RTSP/RTP.

AFAIK, RTSP is the control protocol, and RTP is used to transport the
data.

ethernet/IP/TCP/RTSP. (of course, you can use any other physical layer
instead of ethernet).

Yes, it is text based.
RTSP is being standardized by the IETF (RFC 2326). IETF is an open
standards body, so all documentation is available. Have a look at
http://www.ietf.org/
 . You can search for RFCs at 
http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfcsearch.html
 .

PS: I'm not an expert in RTSP/RTP, but a coworker is working on a server
  implementation, so I know some of the terminology.
