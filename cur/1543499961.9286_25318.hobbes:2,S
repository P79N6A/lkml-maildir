But there is still a hierarchy, just under another name.  "Show me all CDROM
devices" defines a hierarchy based on device type.  "Show me all SCSI
devices" defines one based on the bus the device is on.
Unless you're suggesting that the enumerator generate all devices and let
userspace cope with the result --- which seems needlessly expensive:  a
system call (whether it's sysctl() or read() wouldn't matter) per device,
when searching for only a small subset of devices.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
