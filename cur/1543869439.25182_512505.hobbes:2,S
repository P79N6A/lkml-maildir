Subject: [PATCH 6/9] power management: fix struct layout and docs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/23/289

From: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>
Because the pm ops in powermac are obviously not using them as intended, I
added documentation for it in kernel-doc format.
Reordering the fields in struct pm_ops not only makes the output of kernel-doc
make more sense but also removes a hole from the structure on 64-bit
platforms.
