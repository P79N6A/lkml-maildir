furthermore, the current way of throttling SCHED_FIFO tasks that violate
the limit makes it less likely that application writers would abuse the
feature with CPU-intensive apps, because _if_ you violate the limit then
the penalty is high. E.g. a blatant violation of the limit via a pure
CPU loop ends up getting much less CPU time than even the limit would
allow for. For audio/RT apps this is fine, because they must plan their
CPU overhead anyway so they are a much more controlled environment and
just do things properly to avoid the penalty.
