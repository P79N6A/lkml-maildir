I'm tipping my security hat to Linus (and somewhat away from RFPolicy) 
on this one.  Keeping a large organization free from viruses and malware 
becomes increasingly entertaining the more "day zero" variants there 
are.  And recently, we've seen a lot for the windoze platform here; at 
least one major anti-virus player thanks us for sending them infected 
executables to analyze.  Waiting for some embargo to allow a researcher 
to claim credit just does not work.  We spend all of our time swatting 
flies, waiting for a vendor fix; yet a disclose-without-delay 
quick-and-dirty fix would have saved so many staff hours.

Not here!  :-)  All of my security infrastructure runs kernel.org 
kernels.  (I don't want any vendor "goodies" hidden in places I don't 
know about.)  I punch a button on my heavily-hacked Slackware boxen, and 
the latest kernel, the latest internet-facing servers, the latest 
critical libraries are automatically downloaded, compiled and installed 
whenever newer version numbers exist.  Time to a patched system from 
when the author creates a patch is measured in hours; I compare that to 
the day(s) or weeks I can wait for a vendor to get around to doing the 
same thing.
