Subject: how to actually build SGI's xfs?

Maybe this is the wrong place to ask, but I could find any xfs related
mail list on SGI's site.
How do I actually get xfs to build.  I checked the code out of cvs, but it
leave me rather confused.  There's supposed to be a README.build file in
the top level, but that doesn't exist.  It looks like it's support to
build into an rpm from a spec file, but the spec file is looking for
linux-2.4.0-test5-xfs-alpha.patch which does exist from the cvs tree.
I'm just confused and I'd like to try xfs out.
If there is a proper place for these quetions, please point me there.
Thanks
