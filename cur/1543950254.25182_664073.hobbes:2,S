I recently did an investigation that ended up sampling a subset of those 
stats every millisecond (to get an accurate picture of how many packets 
were being arriving vs being dropped due to rx_fifo errors over short 
intervals).  Ultimately it turned out that we had very bursty traffic. 
So it's not entirely unheard-of to sample at much higher rates.
At the very least, if we're going to remove the atomicity of reading 
registers and updating stats, how about adding a comment to this effect 
in the code?
