Subject: more gendisk stuff

An hour ago or so I put 07-2.4.6pre5-gendisk on ftp.kernel.org
(and rediffed the previous six patches against 2.4.6pre5).
It has add_gendisk, del_gendisk, get_gendisk, blk_gendisk[]
(a.k.a. register_gendisk, unregister_gendisk, find_gendisk),
so that one now can find the gendisk structure given a kdev_t.
Interestingly, there were complaints several places in the source
about the lack of these, but none of the complainers added them.
Al, I don't know whether you are interested in this stuff, but comments
(other than: "the stuff is full of races") are welcome.
