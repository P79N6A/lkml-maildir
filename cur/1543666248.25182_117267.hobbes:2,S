At least in the US, not only does he have the right to defend the name,
he has the *obligation*.  If a trademark slips into "common usage", the owner
loses it.  This has already happened to the floor covering 'linoleum', and
is why a certain manufacturer of copying devices gets rather antsy anytime
a TV or movie script contains a line like "Let me go xerox this", and then
shows any other manufacturer's copier.
