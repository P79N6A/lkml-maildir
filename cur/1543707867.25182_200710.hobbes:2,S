Correct. I was precisely thinking of something similar :) For the sake
of completeness, here is the list of renames that I plan to do:
temp<n>_hyst  -> temp<n>_max_hyst or temp<n>_crit_hyst
sensor<n>     -> temp<n>_type
pwm<n>        -> fan<n>_pwm
pwm<n>_enable -> fan<n>_pwm_enable
vid           -> in<n>_ref
I think that this should define a self-explanatory and easily extendable
interface. There are a few "technical" terms remaining (in, pwm, vrm),
but since these are the words used in the sensors domain, I feel like we
better keep them as they are.
Thanks a lot for your constructive comment, I appreciate that.
