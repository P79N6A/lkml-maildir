No, it would not be kind to HP.  They have supported us pretty well so 
far, and as a consequence I really want to give them the right of first 
refusal.  We're asking for a lot of equipment, and these things take 
time.  This is all further complicated right now by the fact that we 
probably won't get our 501(c)3 decision from IRS until mid-2007.
