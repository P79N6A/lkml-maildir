Subject: [PATCH] (2/2) discontigmem support for i386 against 2.4.20pre4:  discontigmem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch provides generic discontiguous memory support for the i386
numa architecture.  The patch also provides supports for the ia32 IBM
NUMA-Q hardware platform.  John Stultz also has added support for the
x440 hardware... which he'll post soon. A version of this patch is in 
the 2.4 aa tree.
This patch depends on the paddr->pfn patch that I just sent out.
Assumptions made: 
        - that the first node has at least 900Mb of memory
Testing done: 
        - single proc desktop pc (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set)
        - 4 proc SMP system (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set)
        - 4 proc SMP system (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA is not set)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA is not set, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 8 proc NUMA box with 8GB memeory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
	- 16 proc NUMA box with 16GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
Any and all feedback regarding this patch is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Pat
