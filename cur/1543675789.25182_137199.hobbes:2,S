Actually, that would most likely be:
static inline int cdrom_write_check_ireason(
			ide_drive_t *drive,
			int len,
			int ireason
)
{
...
}
At least If I were doing it. Over my 20 years, I've found that many of MY
type errors are due to returning or expecting the wrong structure/variable
because I forgot the type of the function.
I rarely have to look at the parameters (though when I do, I locate them
via the function name, then scan the parameters...) sometimes just to count
the number of parameters, or the order, which is easier when the parameters
are one to a line. Either as in K&R, or the new style.
