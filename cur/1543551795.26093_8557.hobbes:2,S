As far as I know, cdrecord interfaces to Linux either
via the sg or pg devices. No-one would be happier than
I if cdrecord bypassed the sg driver and spoke to the
cdrom driver directly. I know the CDROM_SEND_PACKET
ioctl() is in place for lk 2.4 but from which version
has it been functional in the lk 2.2 series?
Jens, do you know of some example code that shows the
CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl being exercised for non-trivial
work? Something that could be sent onto Joerg Schilling.

Sg has an ioctl called SG_SET_TRANSFORM which is only
relevant to the ide-scsi driver. As far as I know, no
applications use it. Still it is not clear why Mark's
system would work on a UP machine but fail on a SMP box.
