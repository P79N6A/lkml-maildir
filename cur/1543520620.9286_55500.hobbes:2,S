Obvious ? Not to me at least :-)

Hmm. Why ?

There are enough utilities to find such infomation.

And system will try it's best to satisfy such request. You can ask system
to create 10GiB filesystem on 1GiB HDD (with FAT you can do such thing
easily :-) and you'll get random oopses later as well. Why it's Ok for
"normal" device and not Ok for ramdisk ?
TA> If it succeeds then the human has the right to expect it to work.
If there are no 64MiB of physical RAM then it cann't work. If you created
10GiB filesystem on 1GiB hdd -- you made something wrong, not OS. If you
created 64MiB ramdisk on system with 48MiB RAM you are done basically the
same mistake. What's the difference ?

1) You can ignore amount of RAM ONLY since there are virtual memory. You
can not use virtual memory for ramdisk (not yet, at least :-) or for kernel
itself (including various drivers -- some will need big buffers). So here you
should be more carefull.
2) It does not the case with normal memory allocation in Linux. Why Ramdisk
should be different ?

Linux is NOT UNIX. Linux is dubbing Unix only where it's reasonable.

So far I can not understood why it should be fixed. At least I can not
understood why "normal OOM" (in case of OOM linux goes REALLY wild and will
kill random processes including syslog (almost always) and init (sometimes)
and this problem is there for years) does not bother you more then randisk
overflow case. To me situation where system can be killed with stupid runaway
process with memory leak or wild fork is MUCH worse then situation where you
created ramdisk more then there are physical RAM and then system was locked...
At least in second case you made something STUPID from ROOT...
