This patch has no changelog.  Please include the full and up-to-date
changelog with each iteration of a patch.
This patch doesn't apply.  My version of Linux has
	if (trip >= tz->trips || (trip < 0 && trip != THERMAL_TRIPS_NONE))
		return -EINVAL;
whereas yours apparently has
  	if (trip >= tz->trips ||
  	    (trip < 0 && trip != THERMAL_TRIPS_NONE))
  		return -EINVAL;
(plus other changes).
Maybe you have some other patch which predeced this one.
You apparently didn't resend "[Bug-fix]:2.6.25-rc0 Generic thermal
management:ACPI [Patch 2/2]: buildfix for CONFIG_THERMAL=n" which was also
mangled.
So please just start again.  Resend all patches, against latest mainline,
with full changelogs and appropriate cc's, in an unmangled form.
Also it would be good if you could be a bit more conventional with the
patch titling.  For this one, 
Subject: [patch 1/2] Generic thermal management: validate input parameters
would suit.  Section 14 of Documentation/SubmittingPatches has some
explanation.
Thanks.
