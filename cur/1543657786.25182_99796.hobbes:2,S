Got the same yesterday evening when installing 2.5.54 for the first
time....
My second PC which I used for Serial console was not at home,
so if a console output is needed, people will have to wait
for the weekend (which is not that far).
Config was roughly including :
 - Arch = P4, Unipro, APIC
 - CPU Freq scaling
 - ACPI (enum only)
 - TCP (v4 + v6), Netfilter
 - IDE, SCSI (AIC7xxx),
 - Sound (Alsa, EMu10K1),
 - Crypto
This oops happens at the very early stage of the boot process.
By that time, only 10 to 15 lines are displayed on the screen
following the "Booting ...................." stuff.
