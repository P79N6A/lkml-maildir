It's CD metadata.

Not as far as I know. I think you have to copy the data to the
harddisk, format the disc with cdrwtool and then copy the data back to
the disc.

pktsetup can be run before there is a disc in the drive. Therefore,
these kinds of checks are done when you attempt to open the device for
writing.
