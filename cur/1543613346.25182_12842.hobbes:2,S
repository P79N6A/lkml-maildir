If things happened this way for the last 20 years, then the typical CPU
nowaday would probably look like a 20 GHz Z80. :)
When I purchased my PIII 233 MHz 4 years ago, I thought that my next
system will be a full 64 bit system. Indeed I was dreaming. Btw, I donnot
consider an hybrid 32bit path / 64bit path system to be a 64 bit system.
I understand the deal between making money and doing things right. In the
job I earn from, the former obviously applies, but I didn't earn a single
euro-cent from free software. So, allow me, at least as long as this will
not be changed, not to agree with you here and stop the discussion as a
result.
