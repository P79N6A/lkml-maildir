Good!  But see below for one fix ... after that, please split out the
ads7846 update by itself, and submit that patch to the input subsystem
maintainer with your signed-off-by.
Did you find out what was causing the jerky behavior (draw a circle,
it looks like a square) before?

Which has now been merged; minor fixes needed, including a build
fix for AT91.  I expect those will merge by the time 2.6.21 is done.
Looks like that driver is going to get a fair amount of use.  :)

Yeah, support for that board hasn't made it to kernel.org yet.
I hope you'll also update Atmel's other EK boards using this chip.

This part doesn't make sense.  Could you say what you're trying
to do?  The ads7846 requres an external vREF.  Is the issue that
maybe the REF_OFF command isn't just turning off the (non-existent)
internal voltage reference?  If so the comments need updating, and
maybe the name REF_OFF needs to change too...

Heh.  Other than turning whatever-that-is off, this looks like the only
substantive change needed.  You're right, this isn't much at all ... the
ads7843 support has now become almost trivial!
