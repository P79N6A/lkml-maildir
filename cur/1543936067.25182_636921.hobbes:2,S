Yes.  It isn't especially hard.   I have most of it in my queue
I just need to get the silly patches out of there.
Essentially we need to fix the caching of proc_generic entries,
So that we can have a proper d_revalidate implementation.
To get d_revalidate and the caching correct for /proc/net will take
just a bit more work.  We need to make /proc/net a symlink
to something like /proc/self/net so that we don't get excess
revalidates when switching between different processes.
Or else we can't properly implement the case you have described.
Where being in the directory causes the wrong version of /proc/net
to show up. Changing the contents of the dentry for /proc/net
should only happen during unshare.  Not when we switch between
processes or else we get into the d_revalidate leaks mount points
problem again.
We also need the check to see if something is mounted on top of
us before we call drop the dentry.  But if we don't even try until
we know the dentry is invalid it should not be too bad.
