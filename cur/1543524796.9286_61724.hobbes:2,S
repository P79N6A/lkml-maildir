Hey all...
	Just noticed a minor glitch in the kernel configuration that
may need cleaning up.
	If you do a "make xconfig" there is a "misc devices" section.
It's empty.
	If you do a "make menuconfig" and go to the "misc devices"
section, it just dumps you back in the main menu when you try to enter it.
	Probably should be removed or populated with something.  :-)
	Mike
