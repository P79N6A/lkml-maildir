Generally they avoid setting -W0 because it ruins performance and can be
very bad for disk lifetime. The barriers code is there for a reason.
Of course certain distributions default to using LVM for all their file
systems which is completely and mindbogglingly bogus. That both messes up
barriers in some cases and takes a good 10-20% off performance when I've
benched it.
LVM is cool - if you need it, most people don't.
