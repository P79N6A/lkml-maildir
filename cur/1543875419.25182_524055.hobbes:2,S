Yes, I wanted to use that, but my typo I guess.

Well, someone may have attached to this cpuset while we were waiting on the 
mutex_lock(). So we need to do a atomic_read again to ensure it is still
unused. But I notice that check_for_release() has that
atomic_read-and-check-for-zero-refcount inbuilt into it, which means we can 
blindly call it. Modified patch in another mail.
