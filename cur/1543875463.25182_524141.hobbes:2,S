I don't think it is needed. The __user has noderef attribute.
Which means it is not allow to dereference the pointer. The
const qualifier allow read dereference, only write is not allowed.
Adding const here will likely force the caller to do a cast at
the pointer arguments. Which defeats the checker.
Sparse allow passing const void* to void* is a different issue.
