The GPL does nothing to restrict exploitation of the original code as long
as the code is not distributed.  In other words, I can use the code and
modify it to any extent I want. I can then set up a world-wide chain of
co-located web hosting sites using your GPL code on my machines where I
charge the user say $1000/month to serve his web content and manage a
small e-commerce back-end.  I have not distributed any software so there
is no requirement that I share my modified code with anyone. 
The binary is the magic genie.  The moment I give someone a copy of my
executeable, I have to give them the source and can not restrict the
redistribution of that source.  As long as I run my code on my machines
and only sell you the service provided by that, there is no requirement
that I give anything to anyone. I can build a billion dollar empire on GPL
software, all heavilly modified and improved and completey secret.
