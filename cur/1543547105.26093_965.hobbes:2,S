No matter what version 2.4.0 of the kernel I've tried to
install, all it does is make my system immediatly reboot
right when it says "loading kernel"
It is a pentium 200mmx with 128megs of ram, 20 gig hdrive,
its got an Intel 430HX socket 7 mb.
I have tried configuring the kernel as a pentium MMX,
pentium classic, 586, and even 486. Same result each time.
I've upgraded its modutils to the latest release, same
thing.
It boots just fine with the default RH62 kernel.
What is up with this?
