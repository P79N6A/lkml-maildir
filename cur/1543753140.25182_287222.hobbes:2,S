kbuild was changed to reliably pick up the stdarg.h for the gcc used.
Two issues has popped up:
1) sparse did not support -isystem dir
	- fixed a few days ago, and fix is at sparse.bkbits.net
2) misconfigured gcc's that report a wrong directory when using
gcc -print-file-name=include
The directory given must include stdarg.h - otherwise gcc config is
broken.
You are hit by 1)
