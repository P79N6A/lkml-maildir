I have that as a S_ISUID alias that hides directories.
hex  name     ls octal  description
0200 S_ISVTX     001000 save swapped text even after use
0200             001000 protects /tmp directories
0200             001000 does nothing on non-executable files
0400 S_ISGID     002000 set group ID on execution
0400             002000 set group ID on new files in a directory
0400 S_ENFMT     002000 SysV forced file locking
0800 S_ISUID     004000 set user ID on execution
0800 S_CDF       004000 HP-UX hidden directory
0800             004000 does nothing on non-executable files

The '+' behavior is normal and standardized.

OK, we can have:
d  Appears in a directory when BSD filename types are used.
i  Used in an on-disk inode or directory structure.
s  Can be returned in struct stat.
Anything else that matters? In-kernel can have Linux-specific numbers,
so that doesn't matter.
