As for apic_version[] indexing in general, I am also for smp_processor_id,
although it could take a few changes in apic.c, mpparse.c, and especially
smpboot.c. Speaking of es7000, its APIC ID's are always huge, defined by
fixed topology. For those like us, the array would shrink from MAX_APICS
(256) to NR_CPUS (32, maybe 64). I wonder if it would do any good for (true)
NUMA.

Is it possible to use smp_processor_id instead to avoid wasting memory 
for the sparse APIC id case?
