For all of history prior to 2.6.20, there's been the fundamental
reason that even interrupt stacks need to access current_thread_info,
and that involved the (THREAD_SIZE - 1) mask.  But 2.6.20's read_pda
using %gs gets away from that: my guess is that it's now possible
for i386 to use different sized stacks.
