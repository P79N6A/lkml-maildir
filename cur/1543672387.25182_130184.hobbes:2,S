I see where you're coming from, but not being able to compile existing applications 
where they are never used but need to include e.g. cdrom.h, is IMHO even worse.
This is doubly true since this breaks between 2.4.20 and 2.4.21 and the fix only 
touches the stuff that was actually changed (i.e. corrects the added inlines).
Another way would be to always define __u64 etc. in types.h, even if
__STRICT_ANSI__ is defined, given your argument that is maybe a better 
solution (why should the conditional be in types.h header if it's not meant
for userland in the first place).
That would also solve the problem (might break something else though, but
I don't think it's very likely esp. since a duplicate typedef would normally just 
be a warning).
So, would you prefer this:
