Your fix seems to have remedied a problem we are having with EDID  
fetches through vm86.c.  At the present moment, we're trying to  
understand your cleanup so as to back port it to an earlier rev of  
the kernel (2.6.18).
3 questions for you:
1. Are we correct in understanding that your cleanup only touched  
vm86.c and vm86.h?
2. Do you remember your changes well enough from back when you made  
them in December 2006 to be able to point out the changes solely made  
to the audit calls?
3. Does correct operation of vm86.c in the 2.6 kernel require all of  
your changes, or just the subset that affects the audit calls?
Thanks in advance,
-Bill Cattey
