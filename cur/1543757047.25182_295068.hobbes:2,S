I'm not sure what question you are asking... GPIO controllers are
clearly for the purpose of controlling GPIO pins. GPIO stands for
general purpose i/o, so they are used for all sorts of things.
For example, hardware designers hook up all sorts of things to GPIO
lines: input switches, reset lines to other chips on the board, leds,
relays. I have boards where an i2c bus has been constructed using 2 gpio
lines, another gpio is used to control the LCD backlight, etc, etc.
