In my quest to get the wake-ups from idle per second down to bare minimum, 
I noticed 3 places in the kernel that could benefit from 
using init_timer_deferrable() instead of init_timer() -
a) drivers/net/sky2.c - watchdog_timer. This was showing up high on 
Powertop's list of things that cause routine wakeups from idle. After 
converting to init_timer_deferrable() the wakeups went down and this one 
no longer shows up in powertop's list. 25% reduction.
b) kernel/time/clocksource.c - watchdog_timer - same story as sky2.c
c) net/core/neighbour.c - gc_timer - Most benefit from deferrable timer.
I am running a kernel with above changes and haven't noticed any immediate 
problems and the wakeups-from-idle have gone down from 5-7 to mere 1-2 per 
second.
Is there any reason not to make the above timers deferrable - corner 
cases, other side effects? If not then I will submit a patch.
Thanks
Parag
