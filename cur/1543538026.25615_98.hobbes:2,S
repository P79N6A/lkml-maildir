Just for background: I am *not* a multimedia, audio, or anything like that  
guy. My most-used applications are gcc and a news/mail program (running  
under dosemu, btw).

FWIW, a kernel that cannot *at least* guarantee this will happen in  
significantly more than 99% of the cases is broken for *every*  
application.
According to the "hard real time" definitions given by, say, Larry,  
*every* task is a hard real time task. There is *no* task that doesn't  
have a deadline.
Those deadlines are of differing tightness (from microseconds to days) and  
they are of differing importance - partly because the tasks themselves are  
of differing importance, partly because the consequences of failure rates  
differ. (And *everything* has failure rates. There is no perfect algorithm  
in the real world.)
Oh, and 99% is a really crappy percentage. 1% of a year is nearly four  
full days. 1% of a day is more than a full quarter hour. 1% of a 25*80  
screen is 20 characters.

And that's exactly what is needed in the real world. IMO.
