Hi William,
The MSI patch has existed in the kernel since 2.6.3 and has been
validated in both UP and SMP environments. It appears another patch 
(don't know which one) redefined the value of TARGET_CPU, which is 
used by the function msi_address_init() to configure logical
target CPU. The redefinition of TARGET_CPU without checking its 
usage by other kernel code broke the build.
Your patch fixes the build but breaks the devices using MSI in 
different architectures supported by the function msi_address_init().
I have attached a patch that fixes the build and maintains cross
architecture support for MSI.
Thanks,
Long
