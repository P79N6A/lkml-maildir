Please submit patches then. We will be doing another rev of the I/OAT
patch very soon, which you will be able to patch against. Or, once the
patch gets in mainline then we can enhance it. Code in the Linux
kernel is never "done", and the burden of implementing additional
functionality falls on those who want it.

Yeah. Basically you register as a DMA client, and say how many DMA
channels you want. Our net_dma patch for example uses multiple
channels to help lock contention. Then when channels are available
(i.e. a DMA device added or another client gives them up) then you get
a callback. If the channel goes away (i.e. DMA device is removed
(theoretically possible but practically never happens) or *you* are
going away and change your request to 0 channels) then you get a
remove callback.
This gets around the problem of DMA clients registering (and therefore
not getting) channels simply because they init before the DMA device
is discovered.
