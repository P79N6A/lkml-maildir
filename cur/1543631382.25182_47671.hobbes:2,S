Reads and writes are very different beasts - writes deal with
the past and have good knowledge of what to do.  But reads
must predict the future.
You need to do two things:
1: Configure the device for a really big readahead window.
   Configuring readahead in 2.4 is a pig.  Try one of the
   following:
     echo file_readahead:N > /proc/ide/hda/settings   (N is kilobytes)
     blockdev --setra M /dev/hda                      (M is in 512 byte sectors)
     echo K > /prov/sys/vm/max-readahead              (K is in pages - 4k on x86)
   You'll find that one of these makes a difference.
2: Apply 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.4/2.4.19-pre5/read-latency2.patch
   which will prevent reads from being penalised by writes.
   Or use a -ac kernel, which already has this patch.
