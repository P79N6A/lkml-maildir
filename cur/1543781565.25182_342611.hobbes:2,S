unfortunately the space of "patches that break the kernel" is infinitely 
larger (and infinitely easier to generate) than the space of "patches 
that improve the kernel" - so i'll skip your patch for now ;-)

how come it is stopping the machine during bootup? Or does the lockup 
occur during shutdown? changing the local_irq_disable() to 
raw_local_irq_disable() looks wrong because sooner or later we hit 
complete(). You are probably locking up earlier than that though, 
perhaps in stopmachine_set_state()?
but stop_machine() looks quite preempt-unsafe to begin with. The 
local_irq_disable() would not be needed at all if prior the 
for_each_online_cpu() loop we'd use set_cpus_allowed. The current method 
of achieving 'no preemption' is simply racy even during normal 
CONFIG_PREEMPT.
