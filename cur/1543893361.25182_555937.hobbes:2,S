I'd rather have a single file, marked "Japanese" (in Japanese), that
had pointers to current translations. These will always be at least as
current as whatever we have in the tree, if not more so. Especially
when someone is trying to figure out how to work based on the year-old
kernel their embedded vendor gave them.
Further, it might be good for someone to be the "Japanese maintainer".
This person's job would be to accept patches from non-English-speaking
contributors, translate their commit messages and comments, then
forward them to the appropriate places (Andrew, subsystem maintainers,
LKML, etc.). They should also distill and translate feedback.
