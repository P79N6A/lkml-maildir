I start X but it says DRM is disabled, even though the
radeon and agpgart modules are loaded.  Here is the dmesg tail:
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
[drm] Initialized radeon 1.9.0 20020828 on minor 0
[drm:radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init called without lock held
[drm:radeon_unlock] *ERROR* Process 1929 using kernel context 0
There is something X doesn't like.  How do I fix this?
