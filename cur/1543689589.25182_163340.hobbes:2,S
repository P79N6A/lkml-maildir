Think about the code that does this:
	struct futex_file
	{
		struct futex lock;
		int content_len;
		char contents[0];
	};
	fd = sys_futex(&futfile->lock);
	...
	futfile = mremap(futfile, oldsize, newsize, MREMAP_MAYMOVE);
	
Now, if mremap doesn't move the memory, futexes aren't broken, even
without your patch, right?  If it does move, you've got a futex
sitting in invalid memory, no surprise if it doesn't work.
OTOH, I'm interested in returning EFAULT on waiters when pages are
unmapped, because I realized that stale waiters could "match" live
futex wakeups (an mm_struct gets recycled), and steal the wakeup.  Bad
juju.  We could do some uid check or something for anon pages, but
cleaner to flush them at unmap.
Cheers!
Rusty.
