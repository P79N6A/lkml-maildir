Hi.
I'm about to embark on some compact-PCI driver development for Linux and I
was wondering where I can find some info. Is there any difference between
PCI and cPCI development on Linux?
URLs would be great! Or, if this is the wrong list for driver development
issues, a pointer to the correct mailing list would be lovely.
Cheers,
Justin.
