I don't have meaningful values right now, just did some quick tests with
my pc. Regarding openvz it seems to use the CFQ priority-based approach
(with the 3 priority classes: real time, best effort and idle class).
The interesting feature is that it allows to set a priority for each
process container, but AFAIK it doesn't allow to "partition" the
bandwidth between different containers (that would be a nice feature
IMHO). For example it would be great to be able to define per-container
limits, like assign 10MB/s for processes in container A, 30MB/s to
container B, 20MB/s to container C, etc.
