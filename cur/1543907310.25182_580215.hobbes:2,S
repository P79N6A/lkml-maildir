Ok. Will do in the next version.

Because the EFI memory map is converted to E820 map in bootloader now,
it is possible to load 32bit kernel on machine with a 64bit EFI. But it
is almost impossible to call EFI runtime service in 32bit kernel. But I
think EFI runtime service is not essential in this situation, because
the raw hardware can be used too.
