The Matrox Gx00 3D team have direct DMA stuff working and also some of the GART
stuff brewing as simple GPL code. The biggest problem is that a lot of GART 
handling on intel boards has to be reverse engineered because unlike VIA they
dont provide useful info

Yes. Very much. This is the work Precision Insight are doing, an stuff SGI
were doing years ago
