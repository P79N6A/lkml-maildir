It may be that the next block in the directory is not being written to
disk.  Any inodes created in a directory, whose direntries are in the
second block will be "unattached" at fsck time if the second dir block
is not written to disk, because no directory is referencing these inodes.
This would also explain why the direntry offset is pointing past the
end of the first dir block, because the next block was added at the time
the new file was created, but then later lost.
Cheers, Andreas
