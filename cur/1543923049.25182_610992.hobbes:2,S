I see your point...  We could track the caller's task_struct in
dma_async_tx_descriptor, and deliver a SIGBUS in the case of an error.
 It limits the client's recovery options, but at least the damaged is
localized to the correct process.  I need to go read up on what this
would imply for kernel threads like raid5d...
