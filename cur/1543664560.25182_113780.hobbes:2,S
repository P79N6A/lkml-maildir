Well... it's a bug in _all_ archs. They (almost) all call the proc
stuff from request_irq, and worse, on x86, I think, has the
kmalloc inside request_irq changed to GFP_ATOMIC.
You really think request_irq should be safe to be called from irq
context ?
I tend to think IDE is at fault here. It doesn't seem to be a
sane requirement to me to have request_irq be called at IRQ
time. It's rather easy to fix it's kmalloc to be GFP_ATOMIC
instead of GFP_KERNEL, but what about /proc stuff ? And the
day we want to fit IRQs in the driver model, that will probably
involve taking a semaphore as well here and do other IRQ tree
management task that are definitely not something we want to
do at IRQ time.
