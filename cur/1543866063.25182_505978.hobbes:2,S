I know that you see corrections as responses to your own email, but it's
not universal .. Everyone has their own methodology, AFAIK it's free
form ..

I don't take a literal approach to email, which you seem to be taking ..
I think your seeing this thread as an argument for or against something
and you have taken a position which you diligently stick to..
My position is not fixed. However, your arguing as if my position was
fixed. My perspective of this thread was not to argue for a specific
change, but to throw out changes and see if anything stuck ..
Where my statements were suppose to be loose to begin with, so loose as
to only spark the start of an idea, not to promote something specific.
If you read the start of the thread you'll notice that I gave Thomas two
totally opposite ideas.
"We could just remove the timer entry."
or
"[..]how about adding the interrupts to the list which are driving the
timer ?"
When I started the thread I had a similar position as Thomas, but I was
concerned that I was missing something or the code was missing
something.. This was the reason for starting the thread ..
So I'll gladly concede all points. To me it wasn't about the argument,
or even my own ideas ..
Daniel
