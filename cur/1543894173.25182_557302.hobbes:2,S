Look again, it's already happened in the TiVO and other devices.
The software that ships in them is no longer Free Software.
Consider a new microprocessor.
Consider that Linux is ported to it by the microprocessor
manufacturer.
Consider that the manufacturer only sells devices with that
microprocessor with TiVO-like locks.
How exactly can you enjoy the freedoms WRT the GPLed software you got
from the manufacturer?
Now consider that you have a single computer, and that's built by TiVO.
How exactly can you enjoy the freedoms the author meant you to have,
if the TiVO box won't run the program after you modify it?

For the same reasons that the pro-DRM laws weren't mentioned before,
and the patent retaliation clauses weren't mention before: these
specific cases hadn't been studied, only the general idea of
respecting users' freedoms was.

In the program you received under GPLv1.
Hey, you said there was code under GPLv1.1 in the Linux tree.  Then,
there should be a copy of GPLv1.1 in there, otherwise AFAICT the
distribution of that code is copyright infringement.  IANAL.

But do they have the right to not pass this right on, under the GPL?

In what sense does the GPLv3 make this particular point any less
obscure?

Nothing saves anyone from silly lawsuits.  This one would likely be
laughed out of court in no time.  Anyone worried about this should
also be concerned about their neighbor suing them for copyright
infringment every time they set their stereo loud enough for the
neighbors to listen and be annoyed.  (Hint: only the copyright holder
would stand a chance of winning such a lawsuit)

Aah.  I'm not sure I'd have understood it either.

Interpretation as applied to the legal terms, yes.  As for the spirit
of the license, the authors ought to know better than anyone else what
they meant.  Sure, other interpretations might lead to different
understandings as to what the readers *think* it means, but that
doesn't change what it was *intended* to mean.

Oh my.  That's indeed unfortunate and unfair.

Put the considerations above, about a single computer or a
uniformly-limited computing platform, and you'll see that this "on the
same hardware" argument is just a means to deny people freedom.  If I
could stop you from running modified versions on one piece of
hardware, then I could on two, and 3, and then soon it's all of them,
and we're back to square zero in terms of freedom.

If you replace a component in the hardware, are you still required to
provide support or offer warranty?  Why should this be different just
because it's a software component?
