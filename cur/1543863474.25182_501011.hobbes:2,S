Heh, thought as much. (Good) SCSI hotswap bays notice you pulled the disk
release lever and issue an START_STOP_UNIT by themselves to the disk well
before you have time to start pulling the disk out.  I wonder if the SATA
ones do (I kind of doubt that, SATA seems to attract the el-cheapo, el-crapo
crowd of manufacturers).

So, that means it should be explained in the docs that you are to stop the
disk first, if you can.

Even if hald does this automatically, it would still be a very good idea to
document the proper sequence, IMO...
