The main reason for this in JFFSx and YAFFS (but particularly JFFSx on NOR) 
is that flash memory cannot be arbitrarily overwritten without an erase and 
an erase takes a long time.
Eg:  NOR flash typically takes around 1 second to erase a block (typically 
64kB in size) and approx 10usec or so per byte/word to program. So to  change 
a single byte in a block in place would typically require something like:
1.  Read into buffer 
2. Erase block [1 second].
3. Reprogram [0.6 seconds]
+ do that all over again for the update to the file info.
On NAND flash, where erase is far faster, the cost is far less. Still in a 
comparison of YAFFS (which uses log structuring for the same reasons as 
JFFS2) and FAT + block driver for NAND, YAFFS could sustain a write speed of 
approx 10 times the FAT + block driver solution on the same hardware.
Then there are issues like wear levelling (because flash has a limited 
lifetime) and bad block handling etc... but performance (and crash recovery) 
are the main issues.
