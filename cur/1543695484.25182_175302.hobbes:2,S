I would think that knowing when a reply was coming was very desirable, a
keyboard with dead keys is kind of useless if an application uses them
(like any editor which allows function to keystroke binding).
Since you have done the full fix already, is it practical to do it
quickly now? And how does any fix for this map into "really major
bugs?" If the fix is just going to be queued anyway, it might as well
be done really right, assuming that you have the time and inclination,
of course.
