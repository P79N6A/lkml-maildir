Hmm, here <(list) does not work for non-root with kernel 2.2.10 and
bash 2.03, although >(list) works and for root both work. It works with
bash 1.14 because it creates a fifo in /tmp. It worked some months ago,
unfortunately I don't remember if it ever worked with the newer bash.
[qrczak ~]$ cat <(echo foo)
cat: /dev/fd/63: Permission denied
[qrczak ~]$ ls -l <(echo foo)
lr-x------   1 qrczak   bin            64 Jun 24 22:31 /dev/fd/63 -> pipe:[12236]
[qrczak ~]$ echo bar > >(cat); sleep 1
bar
[qrczak ~]$ ls -l >(cat)
l-wx------   1 qrczak   bin            64 Jun 24 22:31 /dev/fd/63 -> pipe:[12240]
[root ~]# cat <(echo foo)
foo
[root ~]# 
Any ideas?
And why is the pipe marked as executable? It does not execute :-)
[root ~]# <(echo foo)
bash: /dev/fd/63: Permission denied
