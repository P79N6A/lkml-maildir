Yes, it was wrong.  I think I noticed it long ago and never bothered with
it because send_sigqueue is nearly unused.  SIGEV_THREAD_ID is in practice
only used internally by libc (timer_create) to implement SIGEV_THREAD, and
it never uses any of the signals handle_stop_signal checks for.
Your fix is good and should go in.
I'd bet noone will ever notice the difference now or ever.
Thanks,
Roland
