Endless scope for argument here!  But I'm relieved to see there's
an MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL subject to a capability check, so this is just
dealing with what a ordinary uncapable process might be allowed to
do to itself.

Yes, that's helpful to separate it out.  I'd prefer a more specific name
than migration_check, but that name may depend on what it ends up doing.

Please cut out this test.  You probably meant to say "!page->mapping",
but those are weird cases best left alone (though rarely would they
have PageLRU set, so they'll probably be skipped later anyway).  Almost
every page you'll meet in an mm has page->mapping set, doesn't it?
Either a file page in the page cache, or an anonymous page pointing to
its anon_vma.  You've already skipped the ZERO_PAGEs and anything else
with PageReserved set, and any VM_RESERVED area (covering some driver
areas).  Just cut out this test completely, it's wrong as is,
and doesn't add anything useful when inverted.

I think that's reasonable.  The page may be "shared" with some other
processes in our fork-group (anon_vma), but we probably needn't get
worked up about that.  Though you could choose to make it stricter by
	if (PageAnon(page))
		return page_mapcount(page) == 1;

I can't see why the fact that some other process has mapped some part
of this file for writing should have any bearing on whether we can
migrate this page.  I can see an argument (I'm unsure whether I agree
with it) that if we can have write access to this file page, then we
should be allowed to migrate it.  A test for that (given a vma arg)
would be
	if (vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED)
		return 1;

So what if someone else is mapping some other part of the file?
I just don't think it merits the complexity of single_mm_mapping's
prio_tree check.   I say delete single_mm_mapping and here just
	return page_mapcount(page) == 1;
Of course, page_mapcount may go up an instant later; but equally,
another vma may get added to the prio_tree an instant later.
It may be that, after much argument to and fro, the whole function will
just reduce to checking "page_mapcount(page) == 1": if so, then I think
you can go back to inlining it literally.
