In general, LMbench optimizes for fast results over exactness.  You can
definitely get more accurate results by doing longer runs.  My view
at the time of writing it was that I was looking for the broad stroke
results because I was trying to measure differences between various
operating systems.  There was more than enough to show so the results
didn't need to be precise, getting people to run the benchmark and
report results was more important.
If people are doing release runs to see if there are regressions, I
think that setting ENOUGH up to something longer is a good idea.
If there is enough interest, I could spend some time on this and
try and make a more accurate way to get results.  Let me know.
