The actual command to send to /dev/adb is different depending if
your machine has the Cuda or the PMU chip for controlling power.
Also, it sorta have to be reset in the kernel when doing a normal
shutdown or your machine will always come back up ;) So we need
some kind of userland script putting it back ON and the kernel
putting it back off.
I'll go dig around to find the exact commands, but you could well
post a message to the linuxppc-dev and get a reply before I find
that out ;)
Ben.
