I have to read "head of the thread list" broadly, and assume it means the
thread will be run when it is the most appropriate thread to be run. I
don't read the wording as requiring or forbidding SMP, uni, or a strict
round-robin scheduler. The term "head of the thread list" doesn't state
that all other processes must get a time slice.
I believe I clarified my concerns in another post, I don't want to repeat
them. I don't want a process with threads contending for a resource to get
all or none of the CPU, each of which is possible with various schedulers
and patches recently available. I'd like to see threads of a single
process be able to get, use, and share a timeslice before some cpu hog
comes in and get his timeslice.
I don't read the text you quoted as requiring much more than 'run someone
else," because it's comfortably vague. To me anyway. I'm not knocking
anyone who reads it more strictly, I just don't see what you did.
