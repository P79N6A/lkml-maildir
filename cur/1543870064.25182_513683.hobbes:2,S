Here are some graphs from the 4-socket/8-way Xeon box (no SMT, no MC
in .config) I posted about earlier.
transactions.png resembles Nick's results pretty closely, in that a
drop-off occurs, at the same # of threads, too. That seems weird to
me, but I haven't thought about it too closely. Shouldn't Nick's be
dropping off closer to 16 threads (that would be 1 per core, then,
right?)
idle.png is the average % idle according to sar over each run from 1
to 32 threads. This appears to confirm what Rik was seeing.
Not sure if my data is hurting or helping, but this box remains
available for further tests.
Thanks,
Nish
