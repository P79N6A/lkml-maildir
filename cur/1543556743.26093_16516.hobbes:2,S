I think we are agreeing
I'm saying use something like
	struct 
	{
		u16 media_group;
		union
		{
			struct hdlc_physical ...
			struct hdlc_bitstream
			struct hdlc_protocol
			struct fr_protocol
			struct eth_physical
			struct atm_physical
			struct dsl_physical
			struct dsl_bitstream
			struct tr_physical
			struct wireless_physical
			struct wireless_80211
			struct wireless_auth
		} config;
	}
