     Ok, need to make my point clear:
  time X: App receives keypresses, and shows its progresses (various numbers updating, etc...)
  time X+1: Keypresses are not fed to application,
but are displayed on the vconsole, application doesnt
update the screen, but is perfectly functional in all
other aspects...
sorry for inconvenience...
