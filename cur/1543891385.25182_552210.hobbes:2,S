Oh well.  Don't lose any sleep over it ;)
<loses sleep>
We could store the size of the allocation in the allocated object?  Just
add four bytes to the user's request, then pick the appropriate cache based
on that, then put the user's `size' at the tail of the resulting allocation?
So a kmalloc(62) would get upped to 66, so we allocate from size-128
and put the number 62 at bytes 124-127 and we poison bytes 62-123?
