I did the following:
1) turn on tso on the server's r8169: ethtool --offload eth0 tso on
2) on the server: tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -w <file>
3) ftp'ed file to 100mbit client
As expected the file was corrupted, and the various corrupted byte
sequences also show up in the tcpdump file at the corresponding offsets.
I did this with 2.6.22.14, so it does not seem to be a recent regression
in .23/.24.
All files can be found here:

I will gladly try out any other tweaks but need some guidance as I don't
know what exactly to change - maybe without NAPI for the r8169?
thank you
