No, direction says what device did or is going to do with the buffer.

To flush PCI controller caches.

It is different.  pci_dma_sync_single(..., DMA_TO_DEVICE), on MIPS for example,
would do absolutely nothing.  At mapping time, the local cpu cache was flushed,
and assuming the MIPS pci controllers don't have caches of their own there is
nothing to flush there either.
Whereas pci_dma_sync_device_single() would flush the dirty lines from the cpu
caches.  In fact, it will perform the same CPU cache flushes as pci_map_single()
did, using MIPS as the example again.
New sequence:
1) pci_map_single(..., DMA_TO_DEVICE).  Flush dirty data from cpu caches to memory,
   so device may see it.
2) device reads buffer
3) pci_dma_sync_single(... DMA_TO_DEVICE).  If PCI controller has caches, flush them.
4) CPU writes new buffer data.
5) pci_dma_sync_device_single(... DMA_TO_DEVICE).  Like #1, flush dirty data from cpu
   caches to memory.
6) Device reads buffer.
Still disagree? :-)
