As I recall the problem was that jiffies since boot was being converted to get 
uptime base on 1/HZ = 1 jiffie.  Since it is really not quite that, there was an 
error.  Using clock_monotonic seemed like the right answer as it eliminated the 
error AND made the result consistant with get_clock(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,..).
The alternate answer is, of course, to directly convert the elapsed jiffies. 
The main problem with this is that this can be a BIG number and, therefor, the 
math needs to be carefully.  And, of course, it is inconsistant with 
get_clock(), but that is a new interface...
