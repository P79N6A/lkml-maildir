Actually, CPU designers have to go quite a ways out of their way to
prevent this BUG_ON from happening.  One way that it would happen
naturally would be if the cache line containing P were owned by CPU 2,
and if CPUs 0 and 1 shared a store buffer that they both snooped.  So,
here is what could happen given careless or sadistic CPU designers:
o	CPU 0 stores &B to P, but misses the cache, so puts the
	result in the store buffer.  This means that only CPUs 0 and 1
	can see it.
o	CPU 1 fetches P, and sees &B, so stores a 1 to B.  Again,
	this value for P is visible only to CPUs 0 and 1.
o	CPU 1 executes a wmb(), which forces CPU 1's stores to happen
	in order.  But it does nothing about CPU 0's stores, nor about CPU
	1's loads, for that matter (and the only reason that POWER ends
	up working the way you would like is because wmb() turns into
	"sync" rather than the "eieio" instruction that would have been
	used for smp_wmb() -- which is maybe what Oleg was thinking of,
	but happened to abbreviate.  If my analysis is buggy, Anton and
	Paulus will no doubt correct me...)
o	CPU 1 stores to X.
o	CPU 2 loads X, and sees that the value is 1.
o	CPU 2 does an rmb(), which orders its loads, but does nothing
	about anyone else's loads or stores.
o	CPU 2 fetches P from its cached copy, which still points to A,
	which is still zero.  So the BUG_ON fires.
o	Some time later, CPU 0 gets the cache line containing P from
	CPU 2, and updates it from the value in the store buffer, but
	too late...
Unfortunately, cache-coherence protocols don't care much about pure
time...  It is possible to make a 16-CPU machine believe that a single
variable has more than ten different values -at- -the- -same- -time-.
This is easy to do -- have all the CPUs store different values to the
same variable at the same time, then reload, collecting timestamps
between each pair of operations.  On a large SMP, the values will sit
in the store buffers for many hundreds of nanoseconds, perhaps even
several microseconds, while the cache line containing the variable
being stored to shuttles around among the CPUs.  ;-)
