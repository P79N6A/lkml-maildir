We are talking about IA64 and IA64 only generates an single instruction 
with either release or acquire semantics for the case in which either 
smb_mb__before/after_clear_bit does nothing.
Neither acquire nor release is a memory barrier on IA64.
The combination of both does the equivalent but then we do not have both 
acquire and release if either smb_mb__before/after_clear bit does 
nothing.
For clear_bit you have both uses in the kernel
smb_mb_before_clear_bit()
clear_bit()
and
clear_bit()
smb_mb_after_clear_bit()
clear_bit() in itself does not have barrier semantics on IA64. Therefore 
smb_mb_after and before must both provide a memory barrier.
