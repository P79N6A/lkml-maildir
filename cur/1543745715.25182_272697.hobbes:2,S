Subject: 2.6.10-rc2-mm2 crashes in early boot

I enabled crashdump on 2.6.10-rc2-mm2 with CONFIG_SMP=y and hit the bug
in smp_alloc_memory() because trampoline_base was allocated too high. 
It needs to be below 0x9F000 and crash_reserve_bootmem() reserves
everything below 0xa0000.  I'm not sure how this ever worked with SMP.  
Here's my .config: 
http://sprucegoose.sr71.net/~dave/lkcd-config
Commenting out the following line makes it boot:
static inline void crash_reserve_bootmem(void)
{
        if (!dump_enabled) {
------->        reserve_bootmem(0, CRASH_RELOCATE_SIZE);
                reserve_bootmem(CRASH_BACKUP_BASE,
                        CRASH_BACKUP_SIZE + CRASH_RELOCATE_SIZE + PAGE_SIZE);
        }
}
The comments don't quite tell *why* LKCD needs any of the memory.  (Oh,
wait, there *aren't* any comments :)
