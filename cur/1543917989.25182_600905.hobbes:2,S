I have a question about these snapshots , what is the right way to apply the patches ?
some magic script ? =)
I have myself a small script which extracts the list of patches for the email and patch in 
that order but I always get a few hunks so I'm not sure is really the right way of doing that.
The resulting kernel does build on my setup but won't boot.Died with grub error 28:
'Selected item cannot fit into memory'
2.6.23-rc8-mm2 booted fine here with the same config.
