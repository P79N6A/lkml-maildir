Hi,
When I setup the disk for multiwrite, I got the following message :
hda: multwrite: count=2, current=0
hda: multwrite: count=2, current=0
hda: multwrite: count=2, current=0
hda: multwrite: count=2, current=0
hda: multwrite: count=2, current=0
the console is flooded with this message and tis stops only when resetting
multi-io management with hdparm.
I cannot remmeber with which version this appeard (maybe 2.3.35).
Regards 
Jean-Luc
