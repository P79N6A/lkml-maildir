Well, we already produce KEY_UNKNOWN anyway, and the stuff you quoted above
just makes KEY_UNKNOWN useful for something instead of keeping it as an
useless notice to the user that some key (which one? who knows!) was
pressed.
Drivers already have KEY_RESERVED to mark positions in the keycode map for
keys that should generate no events, so we are not forcing anyone to always
generate useless events, either.
Perhaps what you dislike re. KEY_UNKNOWN is the part where KEY_UNKNOWN+scan
code is declared to be the prefered way to report keys that do not have a
specific function?  Your reply seems to indicate this, but I am not sure I
really understood what you meant.
I am not exactly in love with the idea of using KEY_UNKNOWN in place of
stuff like KEY_FN_F1 either (I'd prefer to just bump up KEY_MAX and have
more posicional keycodes), but Dmitry is being quite clear that he does not
want to increase KEY_MAX to add more positional keycodes.
