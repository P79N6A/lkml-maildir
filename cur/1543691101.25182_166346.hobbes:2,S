   does this apply to SATA disks?
   what's the status of support for 137GB+ SATA disks? it required 
libata5 patches from Jeff Garzik before (as of 2.4.21-ac4). I see some 
SATA and ata related patches but I can't tell whether those are 
(equivalent of) libata5. I'd appreciate some status update (of course a 
pointer to where/how to find it would be appreciated too)
   TIA
