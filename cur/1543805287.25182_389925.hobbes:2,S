SG_IO turns requests into REQ_BLOCK_PC (or blk_pc_request()) types, so
you should probably check for that as well. But it's truly a miniscule
amount of code, and if I got off my ass and folded cdrom_newpc_intr()
and cdrom_pc_intr() into one (that was the intention), it would be even
less.
It just looks like Joerg needs to do his homework, before spreading
false information on lkml. Then again, all his "arguments" are the same
as last time (and the time before, and before, and so on).
