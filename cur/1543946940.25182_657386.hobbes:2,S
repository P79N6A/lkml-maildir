But it's being used very heavily by existing applications. Can we break/penalize
them because we think it's not a good interface or a method to program?

I am not hiding behind closed source. Please refer to the regression reported by
Yanmin where he used compat_sched_yield=1 (see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/18/7
). The regression might be due to other reasons,
but the point is that people are using compat_sched_yield=1
If you insist that sched_yield() is bad, I might agree, but how does my patch
make things worse. In my benchmarks, it has helped the sched_yield case, why is
that bad? As far as touching the hot-path is concerned, give me a benchmark that
I can run on my desktop, that will convince you that the overhead of the patch
is not all that high. If there is an overhead that is very visible, I'll stop
pushing the patch.
