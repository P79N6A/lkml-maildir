I'm not expert in this field, but my current understanding is:
1. ide0/1 reserved for onboard controllers.
2. on most hardware, pdc20xxx is really additional controller.
3. if we put pdc20265 in "onboard" list on some hardware (mine for example)
pdc20265 is assigned to ide0/1 (even if it's really ide2/3)
4. ide0=<what> ??? (do we have this option?)
Correct me, if I'm wrong.
