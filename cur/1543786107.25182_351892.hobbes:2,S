To quote you:
Instead of the broken fsnotify_unlink/fsnotify_rmdir functions, you can 
split this into two logically _different_ functions:
 - fsnotify_nameremove(dentry) - called when the dentry goes away
 - fsnotify_inoderemove(dentry) - called when the inode goes away
...
The fsnotify_inoderemove() is called from dentry_iput(), and that's the 
one that specifies that an actual inode no longer exists.

I don't think moving it to generic_delete_inode is the right place. 
Anyways, generic_delete_inode is called when the final reference on the
inode is released, but inotify keeps a reference on the inode, so I
don't think it would work.
fsnotify_inoderemove should be called after the dentry for the file is
removed, not when the inode actually goes away. The behaviour inotify
users expect is:
$ watch /tmp/foo (wd = 0)
$ rm /tmp/foo
event sent: DELETE_SELF (wd = 0)
Inotify doesn't care if the inode for /tmp/foo is sticking around for
whatever reason. As far as inotify is concerned, the file is deleted.
