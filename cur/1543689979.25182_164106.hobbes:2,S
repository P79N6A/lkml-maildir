Most of it (the futex_wait tweaks) looked fine to me -
though I look forward to the first report of that BUG().
Part 2, requiring VM_WRITE and removing the comment on VM_MAYSHARE,
seems a regression to me.  Perhaps I misinterpreted Linus' action in
taking Jamie's patch: I took that to mean he relented a little on his
hardline position about VM_SHARED, and now accepts that in this context
VM_MAYSHARE is more appropriate (easier to document).  I know I argued
that readonly futices are pointless, but I thought Jamie gave a good
picture of how a readonly view could still be used.  I'd rather that
part were a separate patch, so Linus can merge or not as he wishes.
In part 5, the Jenkins hashing, I was puzzled by the "/4" in
+			  (sizeof(key->both.word)+sizeof(key->both.ptr))/4,
both.ptr would be a multiple of 32 (? seems to be that way on PIII
and P4, though I gave up trying to work out quite how slab.c aligns),
and both.word would be a multiple of 1 in the shared.pgoff case, or
a multiple of PAGE_SIZE in the private.uaddr case (private.uaddr =
uaddr >> PAGE_SHIFT might make more sense).  Whereas both.offset
would be a multiple of 4.  I don't suppose Mr Jenkins will mind,
but I did find the "/4" puzzling in that context.
