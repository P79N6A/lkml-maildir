One problem is that most architectures define node_distance currently
as nid != i. This would give 0 on them for the identity mapping and 10 
on IA64 which uses the SLIT values. Not good for a portable interface.
I would suggest to at least change them to return 10 for a zero node distance.
Also in general I would prefer if you could move all the SLIT parsing
into drivers/acpi/numa.c. Then the other ACPI architectures don't need to copy
the basically identical code from ia64.
