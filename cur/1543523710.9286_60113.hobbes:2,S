Not via /proc/cpuinfo for sure. This information is NOT information about
processor. There are exist patches to monitor temperature (lm_sensors)
but they will not be integrated in 2.2 and perhaps even 2.4 will not
include them.

Hmm. I've seen random errors with overclocked CPU even when health was
normal. At least make sure that you do not submit ANY bugreports about
overclocked system to l-k ...
