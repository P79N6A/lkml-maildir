Subject: Possible Network bug in 2.2.1 & 2.2.1-ac1

Everything was going fine for me as I moved from
one kernel version to the next, then along came
version 2.2.1
With this version (with and without ac1 patch),
the network doesn't function.
I can try to ping my ip addr (192.168.1.1), or
the 127.0.0.1 lo addr, both return NO packets.
System is RedHat 5.2
H/W:
Abit BH-6
Celeron 300a
NIC = 3COM 3C905B
Does anyone have any ideas why 2.2.1 & TCP/IP doesn't
work on this config ?
Thanks
Mike
