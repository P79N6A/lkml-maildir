in 2.4 we killed READA some release ago becuse of races:
		case READA:
#if 0	/* bread() misinterprets failed READA attempts as IO errors on SMP */
			rw_ahead = 1;
#endif
so I wasn't focusing on it.

yes, and these are in the memory cleansing area (only the journal
commits [and somehow the superblock again in journaling] needs to be
writeouts for data integrity). Data doesn't need to provide data
integrity either, userspace has to care about that.

Not an issue in 2.4. In 2.5 the bio is providing reada still though, so
it would be wrong to wait_on_buffer there.

I recall I fixed all those cases where we write a non uptodate buffer
under reads in ext2 in 2.2 with proper wait_on_buffers before modifying
the buffer. That was enough to guarantee any underlying read would
complete before we were going to touch the buffer. However today with
threading (if they're not protected against reads by the big kernel
lock) they should all be converted to lock_buffers(). they were easy to
spot grepping for getblk IIRC.
