Drive makers fudge the numbers and call 1,000,000,000 a Gig instead of 2 to
the 30th power.  So actually 9789MB sounds right for your hard drive.

The disk manager only fixes the booting problem on machines who's BIOS
doesn't natively support drive a particular drive because its capacity is to
large.  (I misread your question before)  If your BIOS is recognizing all
the space on your hard drive and you can boot off of it from a 10GB
partition then disk manager will not give you anything.  As far as win95
goes there is a 8GB limit if you use the FAT filesystem instead of FAT32.

If you can boot Linux on your hard drive then nothing is wrong, the above
makes it sound as if you have confused the numbers.  If you can't get Linux
to boot then first of all get the lastest stable kernel 2.0.36 or 2.2.0 (if
its out by then), compile it for your system and see if that fixes your
problem.  Check out the HOWTO's as well for other possibilities.
