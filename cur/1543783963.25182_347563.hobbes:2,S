Subject: [PATCH] Kconfig fix (GEN_RTC dependencies)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	Yet another architecture not coverd by GEN_RTC - sparc64 never
picked it until now and it doesn't have asm/rtc.h to go with it, so
it wouldn't compile anyway (or have these ioctls in the user-visible
headers, for that matter).
	FWIW, I'm very tempted to introduce ARCH_HAS_GEN_RTC and have
it set in arch/*/Kconfig for architectures that know what to do with this
stuff - for something supposedly generic the list of architectures where
it doesn't work is getting too long...
