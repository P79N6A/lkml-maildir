Okay,
The 100 sectors are what you could ever see with out vender specific
access, we will not go there ... today ...
Same drive but 110 sectors, with 10 reserved for slip/vender specials,
thus you can only ever get access to 100 sectors.  This is no matter what
you do, or me.
The OS can "de-stroke", oops need to explain.
de-stroke: to reduce the total size or capacity in its appearence or
		presentation to the user.
Yes all OEM's do this because they need everything to look the same.
This is why you may get a replacement drive that is in reality a 30GB
drive but because you had a 15GB drive originally, that is the capacity of
the new drive.  It has been "de-stroked" by half.
Now lets install the Linux on this 100 sector drive and tell it that it is
only 90 sectors in size.  Linux can only access that which it knows about
via the FS.  Thus accessing the drive by the FS will restrict you access
to all regions of the drive.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF			FS-DeStroke
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD		OEM-DeStroke
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO		MAN-DeStroke
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA	MAN-ALL
If we match head and tails (we will need to soon).
D(0) and D(100) need to match.
This is a backup sector, in case D(0) gets wacked, but a Broken Pane.
The BIOS/OS could recover with a redirected look.
Now O(101)->O(110) is were DIAG records by the OEM are keep and there is
no way to get then with out access the OEM subset of the MAN vender unique
access commands.
Now back to D(91)->D(99) are buffer sectors or OEM public data access for
what ever they want.

If you are confuse, good, this is where they want us to be, but I
understand the issues, and will continue to help decode the lingo.
