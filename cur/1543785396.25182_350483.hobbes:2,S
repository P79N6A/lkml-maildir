Subject: [PATCH 0/1][FAT] miss-sync issues on sync mount
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I and co-worker realized that some syscalls like
write and utime issue block I/Os after syscall done,
with sync-mounted FAT.
I'll send out two patches following this E-mail, to fix
these issues.
	[1/2]  fat-sync-write.patch
	[2/2]  fat-sync-attr.patch
