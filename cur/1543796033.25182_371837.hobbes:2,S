I assume this is actually a question.  Its one I'm not privy to other
than whats in 2.6.14.3 and earlier works.  As to when that was merged
into the kernel tarballs, I'll let Michael see if he can date it.  And
then we'ed want to look at anything post that merge date, using the
bisect methods suggested.
However, its not going to be started here tonight, I need some sleep,
drank way too much coffee yesterday & didn't sleep last night at all.

It should work with a stock 2.6.14.3 build if its going to work I
think, although there may be other factors for cards other than my
pcHDTV-3000.  Michael?
