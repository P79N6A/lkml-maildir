It would be much cleaner to just poll the generic monotonic time source here,
not add more special cases.

Shouldn't that be in arch/i386/kernel/timers/hpet.c ? 
Also I suspect it should be made an generic timer object there with
a timer_ops structure. If some hook for that is missing it could be added to 
timer_ops and timers/timer.c
When there is already a generic framework to add new timers it would be a shame
not to use it.
