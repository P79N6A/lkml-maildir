This is all fine.  The question is whether this is a policy management
issue or a kernel infrastructure issue.  So far, it's not clear that this
really necessitates kernel infrastructure changes to support container
aware policies to be loaded by physical host admin/owner or the virtual
host admin.  The place where it breaks down is if each virtual host
wants not only to control its own policy, but also its security model.
Then we are left with stacking modules or heavier isolation (as in Xen).
