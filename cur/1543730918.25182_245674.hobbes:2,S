Thus, this kind of metadata API must be made accessible through the VFS layer, 
if we want to make it FS-independent (not tied to Reiser4). If the real FS 
does not support metadata operations, just ignore them (much like in ISO9660 
ignoring write operations).

I still don't understand why a copy_file() syscall is still missing.
