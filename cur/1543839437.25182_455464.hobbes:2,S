This printk is missing a level (KERN_INFO or similar). Moreover,
it is rather strange for a driver to print a message when no
device is actually used by it. I'd rather drop the version
printk completely, but I know that Jim has strong feelings about
what to do with version information. I suggest that if we decide
to keep something like that in the driver, it should be printed
in spider_net_probe().
