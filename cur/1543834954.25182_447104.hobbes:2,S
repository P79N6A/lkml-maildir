Am I missing something, or it is not marketing what we are talking about?
please I do not understand your point.
For what I understand... I was not supposing reiser4 users to be so mutch,
but this is very usefull because this means that there are more
possibilities to test the code well and to fix bugs...
This also means that there are people who feels the need of this filesystem
for their work because they are not satisfied with the other filesystems, or
because anyway with reiser4 they see that they get better results about the
work they need to be done.
And this is probably the most important point.
