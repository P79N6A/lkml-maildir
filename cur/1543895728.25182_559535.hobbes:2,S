Its just a sanity check...

Ignoring that is deliberate since it doesn't really matter if the block
is bad or we can't read from it, the action is the same...

ok.

All we can do is print a warning, the action will be the same...

Its not a case of formatting the whole partition. The whole point of
this code is the following use case:
1. Device crashes
2. Device reboots
3. mtdoops partition has a log of why it crashed
If you erase the whole partition each time mtdoops loads, this won't
work so the code only finds the next block to use and erases that. It
keeps moving forwards until it finds that block.
I usually hate goto statements but in this case it simplifies the code a
lot (and it is on an error path). The alternative is a while loop with
several new variables, I tried it and it was more ugly/confusing...

ok.

That piece of code is in keeping with the rest of the mtd erase handling
code. Looking through the various wq macros, I don't see any which help
particularly in this case...
