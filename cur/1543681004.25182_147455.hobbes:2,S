Something seems amiss. The deprecated elvtune interface is the old -r/-w/-b command line.
I was lead to believe a new elvtune appeared which supports an option
for changing the elevator under 2.5, however a quick google doesn't turn
up any such patched elvtune, so I'm somewhat puzzled.

Changing the elevator type per device via sysfs does seem to make sense,
however /sys/block/<devicename>/queue/iosched/ doesn't yield anything
that would suggest this is possible (yet).  I think Jens has patches for this?
Right now, afaics, the only way to change elevator is on a global (all
device) basis, booting with elevator=deadline or the like, so it looks
like the quote from post-halloween-2.5.txt has jumped the gun a little
and is discussing an as-yet unmerged feature. Jens ?
