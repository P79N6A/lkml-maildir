If a kernel release works without problems on 9999 out of 10000
machines, is it stable?  How few specific combinations of hardware are
there allowed to be with any problems before you can call it stable?
How do you know a problem you see wasn't tested by 500 people none of
whom had any problems because none of them had the hardware you do?
