      This patch mostly includes checks for kmalloc and init_etherdev
   in the net drivers, but also fixes some bugs on some drivers,
   please take a look and consider aplying.
Plain visial inspection found at least a problem in this part of
patch.

If the allocation succeeds we should return an error?
Surely you made a logic error.  I did not even scan the rest of the
patch since such a simple error like this showed up so early in it.
