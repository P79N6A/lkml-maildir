Until we can account properly for basic things like page tables, the
small kmallocs for things like vfsmount and file structs will be
negligible in comparison.
Fortunately we used to have at least skeleton patches for a framework
in which to do this.  Whatever happened to beancounter, anyway?  Is
somebody maintaining that at all these days?
Cheers,
 Stephen
