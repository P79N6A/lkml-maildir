forget about it then. The thing we "register" is dead-simple:
 struct async_head_user {
         struct syslet_uatom __user              **completion_ring;
         unsigned long                           ring_size_bytes;
         unsigned long                           max_nr_threads;
 };
this can be passed in to sys_async_exec() as a second pointer, and the 
kernel can put the expected-completion pointer (and the user ring idx 
pointer) into its struct atom. It's just a few instructions, and only in 
the cachemiss case.
that would make completions arbitrarily split-up-able. No registration 
whatsoever. A waiter could specify which ring's events it is interested 
in. A 'ring' could be a single-entry thing as well, for a single 
instance of pending IO.
