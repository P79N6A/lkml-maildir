You may be right, and I am not going to say that you are not so given that
I am not a champion in hardware architecture.
However I seem to know that hardware protocols that address
synchronisation of memory, caches and CPU buffers, especially in SMP
systems, are not so perfect. For the i386 arch, the things that allow to
ensure some order on that mess-up are the LOCK prefix and some
serialisation instruction.
In my opinion, relying on apparent ordering instead of enforcing it may
lead to subtil race conditions. We may, for example, be victimized by some
hardware erratum due to brain-deaded hardware optimizations, if we try to
be clever when we should avoid to do so.
Obviously, for the situation you pointed out, we only want to change
atomically a single 32 bit quantity we know about its previous value and
using the LOCK prefix is indeed too much. But, you should, IMHO, base you
demonstration on what may _actually_ happen rather than what seems to
happen when the LOCK prefix is not used.  (I mean TLB misses, cache
protocol possible situations and other goodies as CPU write buffers,
etc... that break apparent atomicity and may lead to races) 
Just my 0.02Euros.
