It is now arch-neutral.   There used to be a couple of x86 tweaks,
but they became unnecessary when some softirq fixes were merged.
So for other architectures the only thing which needs changing
is the actual config entries in arch/<arch>/config.in.  If you
do take a look at this, please send me the diffs for whatever
your architecture is.
I haven't heard much from non-x86 people; there were some remaining
latency problems with PPC many months ago, but they were never
explained and I don't know if the problems remain, or if indeed
they were ever real.
It's kind of amazing that you're seeing 300 millisec stalls on
a system with no local disks - most problems occur in the
VM list walking, dirty buffer writeout, etc.  Unless you're
performing a lot of fileystem work across that FC controller?
It could be that there is an architecture- or driver-specific
problem in your setup.
