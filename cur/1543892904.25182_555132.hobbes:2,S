Hi, Herbert,
For page reclaim one page can belong to only container LRU and only
each physical page is accounted for. Consider what happens when we
equally charge each container
1. Lets say you have containers A and B, both showing that they
   are charged 45% of memory usage
2. The sum of these charges is equal to 90%, but the real memory
   used is just 70%, since 20% of the charges are shared.
The system administrator will find this confusing while assigning resources

Please see comments by Nick at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/14/40
The imbalance is only temporary in the long run, the container
that uses a page more aggressively will get charged for it.
If the container that first brought the pages in is actively
using it, then it's only fair to charge it.

Why do you call the swapping unnecessary? We defined a limit for
the containers, so that other containers are not impacted by
the memory usage of our container. We go overboard, it's either
1. We get penalized
2. We are not well configured, reconfigure

What to do with the free memory is an open question, we've
even discussed implementing soft limits (may be if required
sometime in the future).

Hmmm... could you define the behaviour you expect?

In summary, I would like to emphasize on the following points
1. Let's not build an ideal system, lets build something use-able,
   review-able and understand-able
2. Let's add more features when we hit a bottleneck/problem, code
   development process is always iterative
3. Please try our patches, test them, provide numbers, feedback,
   new patches to improve upon the existing code (in a reasonable
   amount of time, to keep the development on track), you never know
   you might end up liking what you use :-)
