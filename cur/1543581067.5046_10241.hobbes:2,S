I really need the symbolic oops information with the first oops piped
through ksymoops:
>kernel BUG at page_alloc.c:190!
This basically should happen only if the memory zone lists have become
nastily corrupted.  But I'd need to see the decode of this:
>Call Trace: [<c012e465>] [<c0123807>] [<c0123884>] [<c0123a3a>] [<c0112e47>] [<c0112ce8>] [<c01137d4>]

to get an idea of what was going on at the time.. The other oopses are
not interesting, they're just more result of the corrupted memory maps.

This is the likeliest explanation, though. A small amount of cache
corruption due to your quite radically overclocked CPU's can do
anything..
