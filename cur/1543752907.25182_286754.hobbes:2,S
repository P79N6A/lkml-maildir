Vulnerable to what - a bug that has probably taken months to be located
and isn't know to the bad guys right now ?

Let me save you some hassle. On current models anything you are running
more than 5000 lines long probably has serious flaws in it. Your
processor probably has flaws too, and even if you put up your firewall
someone might break into your house with a sledgehammer and take your
computer away (eg the music industry ;))
Its also about -risk- levels and the sum of risk to all parties
involved.
