yes, the `size' arg to find_next_zero_bit() represents the number of bits
to scan at `offset'.
So I think your change is correctish.  But we don't want the "+ 1", do we?
If we're right then this bug could cause the code to scan off the end of the
bitmap.  But it won't explain Hugh's bug, because of the if (next >= maxblocks).
btw, how come try_to_extend_reservation() uses spin_trylock?
