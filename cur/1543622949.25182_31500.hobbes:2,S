Yes.

I don't care. I care 1000% more about clean code than about backwards
source level compatibility.
99% of all users did it for the current task, and for the current task
only. And the non-local users were all in low-level core code (and should
_not_ exist anywhere else - if some driver is playing around with another
tasks signal state, that driver is so incredibly fundamentally broken that
I don't even want to hear about it)
In short, the 2.5.x interface is the correct one.

Not a chance in hell. The backwards compatibility looks like a trivial
one-liner:
   compat-2.4.h:
	#define recalc_sigpending() recalc_sigpending(current)
so what are you complaining about?
