Are we talking about the old or the new aic7xxx driver ?
If it's the new driver, it's breaking on WAY too many
machines and I have no idea why it got ever merged...
I have yet to see a machine where the new aic7xxx driver
works. I'm sure they exist, but it doesn't work on any
of the machines I have access to.
