Yeah there's certainly a sliding scale here.  At the speedy end you've
got register banging, $SUBJECT is one level higher, your concepts are
higher again.
If your concept can perform at a speed which solves the problem which
inspired $SUBJECT then IMO it's a better way to go.  The thing which
worries me is that if we did end up sliding right up the Generic end of
the Generic-Performance slider then we'd end up with a sexy interface
which isn't actually usable for the case which inspired this activity in
the first place!
And yes the speed is primarily the concern of the implementation and
your comments really concern the interface.  On paper the 2 are largely
orthogonal but until I see an alternate/competing patch I'm not prepared
to bet it'll all play nice.

With the $SUBJECT patch, I understand you can (they both fit in a u32
bitmask).  The limitations aren't really the point though - no matter
what the final interface/implementation there will be some limitations.
Either there must be a bulk request interface which will fail if you try
and break the limitations or else the read/write will fail under these
circumstances.
A limitation which springs to mind for any implementation would be if
you specify that the chunk must be accessible in irq context but you
specify some gpios which must sleep.  Yes this is a silly case and
totally the platform's responsibility but the fact is that if someone
makes this mistake an error should be returned *somewhere* rather than
just letting things explode.
In my own personal library of standalone code I've got a GPIO driver
which uses request() to build a cookie representing the gpios to be
driven; read/write then use this cookie.  If the requested pins can't be
batched then it's the request which fails.  I liked this approach.  For
$SUBJECT's purposes though I think it's more symmetric with the single
bit operations to keep request as a refcount and have read/write able to
fail.  Not too fussed though.

Indeed, see above.

Yeah for sure.  Of course since .27 there's been a nice consistant
userspace gpio interface (/sys/class/gpio) so theoretically all the
others are deprecated.  I know that at least on avrfreaks, the main
avr32 support forum, users have to have a good reason to be using the
avr32-specific interface if they expect to be helped.

Which is why we're having this bit of a discussion!  Jaya was the first
person to have this problem and has a patch which, in his case, solves
it.  If you have other concrete cases which need to be solved at the
same time then now's the time to come forward and share with the class.
OK so I've got a board which collects the status of a number of gpio all
over a bunch of chips at a few 10s of Hz, encodes it and fires it across
a network.  This works with single gpio ops but would be streamlined
with batch access.  If the final solution to this problem can be used
for my pins then great, I'll move to it.  However, if supporting my
use-case breaks Jaya's then it's not worth it.

Yeah I'll say again that if we can find an interface as generic as you
suggest and an implementation which performs as well as Jaya needs then
hells yeah, let's go for it.  If however a sexy interface means Jaya's
original use case breaks then I for one won't support that interface.
