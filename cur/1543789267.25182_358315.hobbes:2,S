Second sync is a must, otherwise remounting read-only is not written to 
the filesystem (at least in my case) so no fsck is saved.   But you can 
save first sync (before remount), and then you get nice sequence which 
even admins comming from Windows can remember - they have to use USB to 
safely reboot their Linux systems ;-)  (alt-sysrq-U, S, B)
