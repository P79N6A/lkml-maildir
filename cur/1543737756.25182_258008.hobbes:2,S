Well, but then without preempt, you *still* need to put cond_rescheds
in non-critical-section code. So cond_resched really does seem to be
the only solution (other than preempt).
I think this is why Ingo found he needed a check in might_sleep to get
really good latency (again, I could be wrong here as I haven't been
really following the progress of that work). But imagine when you
unwind *that* hack into the callers. Yuck.
