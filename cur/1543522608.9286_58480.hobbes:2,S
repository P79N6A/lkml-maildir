Well, if there are no drivers, there's probably no noise either, so... ;-}
I still have no driver for my sound-card either, but I wouldn't claim that
one to be good, though (IBM ACPA/A, 8 bit. Wowsa. NOT.)
Are there no spec's available for you card? Have you asked Terratec about
it?
I have spec's for my card, but no time to write a driver, and Alan didn't
seem very keen on taking on the task, so, I guess I'll have to wait
another week for my G4 to show up instead, and use that one to make sound.
