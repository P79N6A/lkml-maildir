I have previously reported a similar problem,
reproduceable with a single machine:
	mount localhost:/   /x
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/junk bs=1024k count=200
	diff junk /x/junk
This often (not always) fails with *differences* on the "diff".
Happens with userland NFS only; not (yet) with knfsd.
The system is a P2-450Mhz with 128MB and *very fast*
raid0 (18-20MByte/sec) disk I/O.
