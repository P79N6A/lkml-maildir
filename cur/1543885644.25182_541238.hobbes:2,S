ACK.
I shall presume that the ARM folks will apply these patches.  You may 
tack on an "Acked-by: Jeff Garzik <jeff@garzik.org>" onto the ethernet 
driver itself.
I'll let the ARM folks review the rest.
I do agree with the comments in the thread that -- as in your most 
recent revision -- the non-eth code belongs in arch/arm.
