everything was random - the child would (if the fork() happened while the 
parent had a lazy pending x87 state) get a random state from somebody 
else.
HOWEVER: this only happens if the fork() actually has pending state on
that CPU, which is often not the case (if it has slept at all since the
last x87 op, or has been timesliced away etc, it won't have any pending
state on the CPU).

They're guaranteed to preserve the control state (it has to: you can't 
just change the exception mask over a function call). However, that was 
buggy at least in 2.5.x, and very possibly in 2.4.x too - haven't checked.
And since preserving the exception mask basically implies doing the whole 
fxsave/fxrestor thing, in practice _everything_ is saved over fork() into 
the child.
