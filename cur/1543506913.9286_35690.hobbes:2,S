Hi,
I don't know what's going on but if it is a memory corruption you may be
able to catch it earlier if you enable the slab debug (and selftest while
you are at it) support in mm/slab.c. This way, the flags used by
__kmem_cache_alloc() for the slab object will include SLAB_DEBUG_FREE and
may help you.
Regards,
