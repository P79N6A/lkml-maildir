the answer is in section 4.1 of the Intel MP 1.4 spec:
   "An MP-compliant system must implement the MP floating pointer
    structure, ..."
So, one would normally expect this to mean an SMP board rather than
multiple processors, _HOWEVER_, I can imagine a very clever MP-aware BIOS
implementation which detects that there are many processors and prepares
MP floating config table and does _not_ prepare it otherwise. So, it all
depends on the BIOS implementation.
Actually, I never tried unplugging all-1 processors from my SMP machines
and seeing what sort of MP table is left...
