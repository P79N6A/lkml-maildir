Yep. I'm doing some tidying up. The work is still in
development but I'm trying to get some patches ready
so people and compare and contrast :-).

I'm afraid my SPI subsystem doesn't either :-(. But it
hopefully shouldn't be hard to add :-)

The way my subsystem gets around this is that each
adaptor has a CS table which describes what clients
are on what chip select. This is then used in the core
layer to 'probe' for devices. If a match is found (the
name of a client driver matches a name in the CS
table) then the clients probe function gets called
from which the client could also do some checking
(like I2C) and if it is happy that it is talking to
the device it was written for then it attaches the
cline to the bus.

Hmm, SPI as no protocol like I2C but, to me, that
makes it harder as you can do more things with it. You
also have different clock modes and speeds unlike I2C.

Hopefully more SPI patches coming soon. You have been
warned :-)
