Now that we are discussing this stuff anyway:
The names chosen are really bad, they are an invitation for
confusion and bugs.
We have "sectors" and it gives a count of sectors, like 0x7280b80
(yecch - why in hex??).
But "legacy_sectors" is not a number of sectors, but a number of
sectors per track, just like "default_sectors_per_track".
We have "default_heads" and it is a number of heads, like 0xff
(yecch - why in hex??).
But "legacy_heads" is not a number of heads, it is the largest
head number, that is, one less than the number of heads.
Please, now that this is still unused, fix your names and/or
your code. Names could be legacy_max_head (etc.) if you want
to keep the values, or otherwise add 1 to the values.
Note that sectors are counted from 1 here, so by some coincidence
legacy_max_sectors_per_track is the same as legacy_sectors_per_track.
Also - people will try to match the 0x7280b80 for int13_dev83 with
the 120064896 sectors that dmesg or hdparm -g reports for /dev/hdf.
Life would be easier with values given in decimal, as they are
everywhere else.

It is basically impossible, but it is easy to give heuristics
that very often work. Very good that that now is a job left
to user space.
