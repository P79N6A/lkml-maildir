Subject: Makefile could check gcc version?

i was going to hack up a patch in the Copious Free Time, but until
that happens ;-) since there's a lot of misunderstandings about which
compiler should build working kernels, couldn't the makefile take some
time to check the gcc version string and make an appropriate
recommendation?
i mean, between the Will of Linus (2.7.2.3), and Alan's testing for
RedHat (some egcs versions work (1.2.1? i still use 2.7.2.x)), and
lots of bug reports for 2.95.x, it should be pretty easy to just dump
out at least a warning for those using bleeding-edge compilers...
thoughts?
