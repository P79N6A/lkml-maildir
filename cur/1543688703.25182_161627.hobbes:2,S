My noacpi-option-fix should solve the pci=noacpi issue. It is available at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-
test4/2.6.0-test4-mm2/broken-out/noacpi-option-fix.patch
Alternatively you may run 2.6.0-test4-mm2 or -mm3 as these include the patch 
(and many other things)...
