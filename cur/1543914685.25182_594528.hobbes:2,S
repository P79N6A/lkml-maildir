But if the instruction is architecture dependent, and you run on the
wrong architecture, now you have to patch many locations at fault time,
introducing some nasty runtime code / data cache overlap performance
problems.  Granted, they go away eventually.
I prefer the idea of a hypercall page, but not a central initialization.
Rather, a decentralized approach where PV drivers can detect using CPUID
which hypervisor is present, and a common MSR shared by all hypervisors
that provides the location of the hypercall page.
