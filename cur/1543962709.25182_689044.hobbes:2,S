In the same way that ESR's arse would improve if he'd not wear pants: by him 
going to the gym more to avoid at least a few of the many disgusted stares.
ie, the magic would be in the quality of the code being greater simply due 
to developer being aware of the openness. The effect probably wears of after 
enough time though...
