I have defined __NO_VERSION__ before including module.h because in my
understanding this is required when you include it in a multi-files module.
Only one file must include module.h without defining the __NO_VERSION__.
I remember to read something about a repository for your new driver. Please
could you point it to me and I will try it ASAP.
Thanks,
