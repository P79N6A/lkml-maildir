zgv just learned :-)
Actually, its svgalib. And it now (in the latest pre-release of 1.4.1)
reads only the first bytes of each pci device configuration, and reads
the rest only of vga cards. Hopefully, none of those have this problem
(which, in my opinion, is stupid, even though it is allowed by the
specs).
