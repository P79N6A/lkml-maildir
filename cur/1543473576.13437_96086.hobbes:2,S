Subject: [Call For Testers] New variant of ext2 patch available.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1998/12/31/42

	Stuff in this patch:
*	sys_mknod() cleanup - now it uses ->create() for regular files,
	leaving ->mknod() method to deal only with devices, fifos and sockets.
*	general ext2 cleanup
*	ext2-specific parts of inode and superblock are allocated separartely.
	Rationale: unions in struct inode and struct super_block are bogus and
	make inodes too heavyweight, no matter what fs we are using. It becomes
	especially ugly if we want to implement layered filesystems.
*	Bug in ufs headers fixed: it (ab)used ext2 definitions
*	Fix for related lossage in ufs handling mount options.
*	pipe_inode_info taken out of struct inode. Pointer to it bloody
	taken out of ->u. part of inode - if C program uses two fields
	of the same union simultaneously it's buggy. See comments in
	fs/Changelog for more details.
*	Several stupid bugs introduced by previous version had been fixed.
 	WARNING: since this stuff touches ext2fs driver DON'T TRY IT ON
 YOUR REGULAR FILESYSTEMS READ/WRITE. Always mount a scratch monkey ;-/
 Said that, one of my boxen runs the patched kernel with everything
 mounted rw. Right now my worst concern being the possiblity of leaks.
	Testers are more than welcome, indeed. Patch is available on
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-patch-12.gz. It's against 2.2.0-pre1.
 							Cheers,
								Al
