syscalltrack can do it, per executable / user / syscall parameters /
whatever, but it's per syscall. Writing a perl script or C program to
iterate over the supplied syscall list and write the allow/deny rules
is pretty simple. Also, syscalltrack is meant for debugging, not
security, so if you want something that's 100% tight you'd better go
with one of the Linux security modules based on the LSM framework.

Yeah, syscalltrack can do that ;-)

Since it's a known binary, if you can handle the increased run time,
strace is your best shot. syscalltrack and other kernel based
solutions are best when you need something that is "system wide".

Previous discussion seemed to conclude that features like these are
"not interesting enough to the majority of users". Maybe it's time to
revise those discussions (c.f. the inclusion of SELinux, for
example).
