And that explains why CFS-v3 on 21-rc7-git3 wouldn't show me the hang. 
As a matter of fact, nothing I did showed any bad behavior! Note that I 
was doing actual badly behaved things which do sometimes glitch the 
standard scheduler, not running benchmarks.
This scheduler is boring, everything works. I am going to try some tests 
on a uniprocessor, though, I have been running everything on either SMP 
or HT CPUs. But so far it looks fine.
