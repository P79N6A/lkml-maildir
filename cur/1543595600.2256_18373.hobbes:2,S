Ok, I need to describe the problem a little better.  reiserfs inodes need
to be logged, which means you have to join/start a transaction in order to
write them.
So, if kswapd tries to write them, it might end up waiting on the log.
Normally this is not a big deal, but almost allocations in reiserfs use
GFP_BUFFER, which means we never end up doing i/o ourselves in
page_launder, and always end up waiting on kswapd.  So, kswapd waits on
reiserfs and reiserfs waits on kswapd (none of these are spin locks ;-)
The work around I've been using is the dirty_inode method.  Whenever
mark_inode_dirty is called, reiserfs logs the dirty inode.  This means
inode changes are _always_ reflected in the buffer cache right away, and
the inode itself is never actually dirty.
So, the only time reiserfs_write_inode needs to do something is for fsync
and/or O_SYNC writes, and all it needs to do is commit the transaction.  
Any time kswapd is calling write_inode, it is just trying to free the inode
struct, and reiserfs can safely ignore the write request, regardless of if
a sync is requested.
