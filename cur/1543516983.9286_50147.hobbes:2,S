I did encounter the same problem here (SMP, 2 x Xeon 550). The 2.2.10-ac10
kernel which worked perfectly on the same machine with 2 x PPro200/512 have
become very fuzzy and fragile when I did replace the 2 x PPro motherboard
with 2 x Xeon one. Sometimes I do have load average of 15+ totally out of
the blue (both CPUs are almost idle), all RAM and swap eaten and the machine
has to be rebooted.
Unfortunately enough, no 2.3 kernel after 2.3.24 (did not try earlier ones)
does boot here even if built with kgcc-2.7.2.3 :((
2.2.14preX do not go either....
