Yes, this bug is causing a lot of people to waste time.  I fielded an
internal request for this patch this afternoon.  I appreciate we're
post-rc6 at this point, but it does rather suck to be releasing a kernel
which freezes on boot on this class of machines.
Unfortunately if this patch does cause any machine to break, these will
be machines that worked fine up until this point, so that would be a
regression, which is worse.  Life sucks.
