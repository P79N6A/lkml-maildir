The NFS example was just one example; they are intended for 'suspend at
any load'. Actually, I should say, they're intended for 'suspend first
time at any load'. Maybe I should go back into the mailing list logs
from around the time when we made the change, to see again the kind of
issues we were attacking.

I believe we achieve that. All the hooks do is atomically adjust a
counter of the number of busy processes, adjust process flags (in the
case of processes running sync), and check that we're not trying to
suspend. None of those things should affect reliability, and months of
testing by many users has not given any indication that they do.

Not arguing there. I either want to merge the whole lot at once
(unlikely, I know), or in discrete patches. I'm sure there must be some
bugs left somewhere that people will spot.
