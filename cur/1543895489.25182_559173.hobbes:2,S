Yeah, and that code really was *designed* to make all "locking in a loop" 
go away. So unlike the patches adding random barriers and cpu_relax() 
calls (which might fix it for some *particular* hw setup), I pretty much 
guarantee that you can never get that code into a situation where there is 
some lock being starved on *any* hw setup.
Ingo, an ack for the patch, and I'll just apply it?
