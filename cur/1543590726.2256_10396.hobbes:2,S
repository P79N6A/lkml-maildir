I was surmising something like that, but in that case aren't 
ENOIOCTLCMD and ENOTTY redundant? That is, could not every occurrence 
of ENOIOCTLCMD be replaced by ENOTTY with no change in function? 
That's what's confusing me: why the distinction? It's true that the 
current scheme allows the dev->ioctlfunc() call below to force ENOTTY 
to be returned, bypassing the switch, but presumably that's not what 
one wants.
