Hi people,
My laptop which runs 2.5.6 today decided to fsck / because it had been
mounted 20 times. During those 20 times I think it had in the order of 5
unclean shutdowns (empty battery mostly), all of them running 2.5.6
according to 'last'.
The fsck reports, from what I can recall:
inode X i_blocks=n, should be m. FIXED
About 8 of these. M is always smaller than n. The difference appeared to be
always a multiple of 8. One case was '32, should be 24'. Another was '80,
should be 8'. Larger differences were reported too.
The fs appears to work just fine though. If there is any other information
you need, just let me know.
