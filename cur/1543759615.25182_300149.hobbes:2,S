I've posted a patch for the cdu31a driver some time ago that removes 
almost all usage of interruptible_sleep_on() and also 
{save,restore}_flags() - it uses semaphore instead.
The only remaining code is in sony_sleep() function when using 
IRQ-driven operation.

The patch is big because I've messed with the formatting...
