Ok, now funny bit happends. Simple program like that:
while(1){
    char *a=malloc(1024*1024*16);
    if (a==NULL)
       break;
}
can allocate only about 200MB, than exits. That's the fist thing.
Second one, starting KDE, and when swap usage != 0 (just to be sure 
there is no problem with any assumption), gives me loads of error 
messages (see attached file).
Very bizzare behavior.
