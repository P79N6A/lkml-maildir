Some broken protocol in the kernel, incremented a refcount but forgot
to cleanup when notified on device removal.
There was a bug in the VLAN code that did that, not sure which version
it was fixed in.
Do you have IPV6 installed (as a module)?
In some kernel versions, IPV6 has a problem with device ref counting, and
leaves a dangling reference.
