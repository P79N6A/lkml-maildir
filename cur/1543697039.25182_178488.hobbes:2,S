thanks, I've now found a way to deal with the problem.  after calling
create_proc_entry(), I put a pointer to my hash table in
proc_dir_entry->data.  The proc_dir_entry->proc_fops->open() function
then calls seq_open() and sets seq_file->private to PDE(inode).  This
way the seq_operations->start/next/show functions can find out the

It's not part of the stock kernel, but something I've been working on
the last couple of days.  An iptables match module called 'dstlimit'.
(
http://cvs.netfilter.org/netfilter-extensions/matches_targets/dstlimit/
)
This match creates a new hash table (yes a table, not just an entry) for
every rule in which you use that match.  Mainly for testing/debugging
purpose, I want to be able to read the contents of each hash table via a
/proc file (/proc/net/ipt_dstlimit/*).
The implementation is now done in the way I described above, and it
seems to be working quite fine.
Thanks to everybody helping me with this issue.
