Experience indicates that for whatever reason, big stack consumers for
all three contexts never hit at the same time.  Big stack consumers
for one context happen too often, though.  "Too often" may be quite
rare, but considering the result of a stack overflow, even "quite
rare" is too much.  "Never" is the only acceptable target.
Change gcc to catch stack overflows before the fact and disallow
module load unless modules have those checks as well.  If that is
done, a stack overflow will merely cause a kernel panic.  Until then,
I am just as conservative as Andreas.
