I've following problem with wavelan: Sometimes appears in dmesg: 
eth0: wv_receive(): missing EOF flag.
eth0: wv_receive(): missing F flag.                                             
In same cases after this, wavelan stops "hearing". It's not able to
receive any packet. To wake it up, I've to write
ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig eth0 up
Could someone help me?
