Agreed.
Path names and file names in sysfs are an API, so it is important
to choose them wisely.  The string "acpi" should not appear in
any path-name or file-name in sysfs that is intended to be generic,
as it would make no sense on a non-ACPI system.
Neither the ACPI /proc/acpi/battery API or
the tp_smapi /sys/devices/platform/smapi API qualify as generic.
It it a historical artifact that /proc/acpi exists, I'd delete it
immediately if that wouldn't instantly break every distro on earth.
Re: battery events
Vojtech suggested that we create a virtual battery interface,
just like the input layer has virtual input devices.
Drivers such as above could conjur up devices, and user-space
could also create what look like batteries, say through a
utility that knows how to talk to a UPS.
In either case, user-space would look for a well known set
of device file names, such as /dev/battery0, /dev/battery1
or some such, do a select on the file and get events that way.
With a /dev/battery0, and IOCTLS to get information from it,
the question becomes redundancy between that file and sysfs
text files.
Re: sysfs or /dev
It is tempting to claim that sysfs is extensible, but note
that whenever you create a sysfs file, you are creating an API,
which is a decision of exactly the same magnitude as defining
an IOCTL -- in either case, user-space needs to react to it
to understand it -- just that you can do that from the shell
with sysfs.
