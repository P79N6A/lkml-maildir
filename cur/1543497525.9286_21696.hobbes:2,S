Given that a small minority of systems can boot an IDE CD-ROM, and an
even smaller minority of laptops can boot an IDE PCMCIA device, this
is bullshit.
And the current PCMCIA architecture does not make it any more painful
than for any other driver.  Red Hat uses an initrd for *all* their
drivers on the installation image.  There are too many drivers, at
this point, to put *everything* in one image, so PCMCIA is in a
separate image.  Which was their choice: it wasn't required by the
PCMCIA architecture, and your alternative would not be made any easier
by allowing PCMCIA to be linked into the kernel, because no one would
do this in an installation environment.
