Why not just release a 2.2.13 with nothing but this fix in it?  We
don't really want to get to where someone isn't safe grabbing the
latest stable release of Linux without checking an errata page on
uk.linux.org, but that was the case during 2.2.11's tenure.
I had immediate problems with 2.2.11 (on Intel, both SMP and UP), and
only occasional problems with 2.2.12, but it's embarrassing to have
Linux stability trouble in front of the bean counters.  Known bug
fixes ought to spark a release, I'd think, just like 2.0.37-->2.0.38.
(The 2.2.12 'trouble' was an out-of-memory condition just like 2.2.11.)
