I agree completely. I was already planning to work on improving the
write path at some point.
The read path is more important though, these networks are asymmetric -
Sierra Wireless specifies max 2.4Mbps download vs 153Kbps upload for the
EM5625 and MC5720, presumably the other devices are similar. So this
patch was focused on getting the best read performance.
