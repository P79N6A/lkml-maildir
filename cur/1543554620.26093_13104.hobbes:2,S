Gert can't mount at all, so I removed my VFAT factory formatted zipdisk

Al, my original oops report is here:
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/2000week42/1240.html
Summary: Test10 is broken for both filesystems (sick of fsck'n-not
confirmed)
	 11pre1-pre2 work for VFAT broken for EXT2
	 11pre3 is broken for both filesystems
   Anything you want me to try just let me know, I've already been
through about 100 fscks, a few more won't hurt.
   BTW I have a list of 23 common non-obvious files that changed in
test10/11pre1 and 11pre2/pre3, say the word and I'll mail the list.
