I don't think this breaks K8 per-se, because x86_cpu_to_apicid[] is setup if
acpi is compiled in and k8topology sets up apicid_to_node[] at
k8_scan_nodes. That said, I don't know for sure as I don't have a K8 yet. If
someone can test this patch on a opteron, compiled with
ACPI_NUMA as well as K8, (but which falls back to K8 at boot), 
it will be helpful.

Sure.
