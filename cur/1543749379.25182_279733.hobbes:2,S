They all default to on. There's actually a fourth that is also on, but
you cannot turn that off (noop). It's there if you disable the other
three, in lack of a better way to express that in Kconfig.

The io schedulers don't provide any ioctls, must be something else. I
suggest you strace whatever program is throwing these errors and find
out what is going wrong.
