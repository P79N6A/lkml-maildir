Some time ago here was a discussion about kerneld and Linux 2.2.x kernels.
I remember it was proposed to use a 'rmmod -a' from cron to unload unused
modules. But it doesn't work at least for 2.2.10 and 2.2.13 kernels.
I look sys_delete_module () from module.c, and it seems MOD_VISITED flag
is always set.
With best regards,
