   I'm afraid your concerns about kernel code size eating into buffer
   cache or user memory are slightly out of date. These days it seems
   damn near impossible to buy anything with less than 32 MB memory!
There are third world countries where Linux is used heavily where a
486 with 16MB of ram is a "big computer".  These concerns are by no
means out of date at all.
