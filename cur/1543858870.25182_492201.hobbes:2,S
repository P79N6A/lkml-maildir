Hello.
I am pleased to announce new release of the acrypto for 2.6.19 kernel -
first asynchronous crypto layer for Linux kernel 2.6.
Acrypto allows to handle crypto requests asynchronously in hardware.
Acrypto supports following features:
 * multiple asynchronous crypto device queues
 * crypto session routing (allows to complete single crypto session when
   several operations (crypto, hmac, anything) are completed)
 * crypto session binding (bind crypto processing to specified device)
 * modular load balancing (one can created load balancer which will get
   into account for example pid of the calling process)
 * crypto session batching genetically implemented by design (acrypto
   provides the whole data structure to crypto device, i.e. it is
   possible to use acrypto as a bridge which routes requests between
   completely different devices, since it does not differentiate between
   users, just handles requests)
 * crypto session priority
 * different kinds of crypto operation(RNG, asymmetrical crypto, HMAC and
   any other)
Combined patchset includes:
 * acrypto core
 * IPsec ESP4 port to acrypto
 * dm-crypt port to acrypto
 * OCF to acrypto bridge, which allows to run OCF device
   drivers with acrypto (for example ixp4xx), requires OCF installed.
Ported crypto drivers and benchmarks can be found on acrypto homepage:
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/old/?section=projects&item=acrypto
Changes from previous release:
 * moved to 2.6.19 crypto API where it is used
 * updated XFRM engine
 * bugfixes
2.6.16 - 2.6.18 releases moved to maintenance mode.
Patchset is not attached due to its size (192kb).
