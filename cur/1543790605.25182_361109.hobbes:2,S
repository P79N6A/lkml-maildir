the best value for HZ is not architecture specific, it depends on the 
usage pattern.
The rule is roughly:
- low HZ for computations
- high HZ for interactive usage
Making HZ selectable at boot time wouldn't be hard, but I doubt it's 
worth it because it would make the kernel both bigger and slower.
