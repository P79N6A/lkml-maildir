I just faced the same problem, but on a HPPA (PARISC) box with 32bit kernel.
Just reported at the parisc-linux kernel mailing list as well:
http://lists.parisc-linux.org/pipermail/parisc-linux/2006-December/030810.html
Summary:
Just got a kernel crash with our git tree code.
Not sure if this is generic problem or related to parisc.
I didn't investigated any further. 
Just reporting here in case someone has an idea.
IPV6 and serial console were enabled.
Turning IPV6 off fixed it for me.
