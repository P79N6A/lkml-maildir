Subject: [ANNOUNCE] 2004-04-01 release of hotplug scripts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've just packaged up the latest Linux hotplug scripts into a release,
which can be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2004_04_01.tar.gz
or for those who like bz2 packages:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2004_04_01.tar.bz2
As this release was primarily a sync up with a bunch of pending Gentoo
patches, I did not build rpm packages, as there was nothing really new
that any Red Hat user would care much about.  That's also why I didn't
update the sf.net page (besides it being a big pain to do so...)
The main web site for the linux-hotplug project can be found at:
	
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net/
which contains lots of documentation on the whole linux-hotplug
process.
The release is still backwards compatible with 2.4, so there is no need
to worry about upgrading.
The full ChangeLog extract since the last release is included below for
those who want to know everything that's been changed, and who to blame
for them :)
thanks,

        - hotplug.functions: $MODULE need s/-/_/g to match with lsmod output
        - usb.agent: use $DEVPATH for $REMOVER if $DEVPATH is defined.
           when coldplugging on 2.6.*, we don't know $DEVICE, but $DEVPATH,
           so $DEVPATH should be used for unique string to device.

        - input.agent: don't try to check empty $dev_bits in input_match_bits
           some posix shell may complain on it.
