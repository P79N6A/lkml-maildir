writepage under i_mutex is commonly done on the
sys_write->alloc_pages->direct-reclaim path.  It absolutely has to work,
and you'll be fine relying upon that.
However ->prepare_write() is called with the page locked, so you are
vulnerable to deadlocks there.  I suspect you got lucky because the page
which you're holding the lock on is not dirty in your testing.  But in
other applications (eg: 1k blocksize ext2/3/4) the page _can_ be dirty
while we're trying to allocate more blocks for it, in which case the
lock_page() deadlock can happen.
One approach might be to add another flag to writeback_control telling
write_cache_pages() to skip locked pages.  Or even put a page* into
wrietback_control and change it to skip *this* page.

yup.  Or another CPU can do the same.

Perhaps a heavier workload is needed.
There is code in the VFS which tries to prevent lots of CPUs from getting
in and fighting with each other (see writeback_acquire()) which will have
the effect of serialising things for some extent.  But writeback_acquire()
is causing scalability problems on monster IO systems and might be removed,
and it is only a partial thing - there are other ways in which concurrent
writeout can occur (fsync, sync, page reclaim, ...)

err, it's basically an open-coded mutex via which one thread can get
exclusive access to some parts of an inode's internals.  Perhaps it could
literally be replaced with a mutex.  Exactly what I_LOCK protects has not
been documented afaik.  That would need to be reverse engineered :(
> What is its relationship to i_mutex?
On a regular file i_mutex is used mainly for protection of the data part of
the file, although it gets borrowed for other things, like protecting f_pos
of all the inode's file*'s.  I_LOCK is used to serialise access to a few
parts of the inode itself.
