Let me guess, the sound skips unless you run at a low nice value.
That's bad design on the part of XMMS.
nice is the wrong way to handle RT constraints.  You need a proper
design (ie multithreaded).
See JACK for an example of how to do it right.

Or, since you don't need low latency, use a bigger buffer.
Proper handling of RT constraints has been discussed to death on LKML
and other lists (executive summary: almost no one does it right.
mplayer is one of the most egregious offenders).
