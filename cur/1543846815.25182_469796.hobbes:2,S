A full set of user-visible kernel headers for all supported
architectures, exported from the 2.6.19-rc1 kernel, has been uploaded
to
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/dwmw2/kernel-headers/snapshot/
I had planned to do this for 2.6.18 but it wasn't quite in good enough
shape by then. This one should be fine -- you can build your C library
against it and ship it in /usr/include. And tell me what breaks...
I probably won't do tarballs corresponding to -rc releases very often
but I'll do the proper releases.
