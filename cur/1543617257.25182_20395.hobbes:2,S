Hi
I've an aic7899: Ultra160 Wide scsi controller with a few disks
under an alpha ds20 running.
Now I'm having troubles getting 160MB/s bus speed on the
actual kernels (2.4.18pre2/2.5.2pre9). On the kernel 2.2.18 and
the redhat kernels 2.4.3-12, 2.4.9-13 I get full speed of 160MB/s.
But on the new kernel I get just 80MB/s per bus.
So I took a look at the differences between 2.4.9-13 and 2.4.18pre2.
You can find a diff of the aic7xxx driver here:
    
http://www.scs.ch/~walser/aic7xxx.diff
Basically its the aic7xxx version 6.2.4 insteed of 6.2.1 in the new
 2.4.18pre2 kernel. I couldn't find where the problem comes from.
Here also some proc info:

Do you have any hints to get back the full 160MB/s speed?
