This applies to all kernel versions since w83781d was brought in from 
the lm_sensors project.
The subclients of w83781d are never registered with i2c_attach_client().
But, w83781d_detach_client() tries to i2c_detach_client() them anyway.
This was harmless, until i2c-core was "listified"... because the old
array method silently ignored the attempt to detach a non-existent client.
The latest lm_sensors CVS of w83781d has the necessary i2c_attach_client()
calls - not sure why they were removed during conversion to 2.5.x.  Do we
intend to attach these subclients or not?
