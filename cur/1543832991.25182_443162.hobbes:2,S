There is always some sort of prereq when new features get added.
Documentation/Changes has a long list. Some setup need more updates,
some need fewer updates. No idea what your experience is.
Old klibc was trivial to build (modulo that kernel header mess), and I
expect that kinit handles old kernels.

Once prepare_namespace is gone, there is no userspace code left.
