Also PRO: Can be verified by non-IBM people, high resistance if there is
a flaw (accidental or US government 8)) in the 390 hardware.

And people can pipe this into the urandom layer if they wish.

Global variables called "p" and "parm_block". Plus parm_block appears to
be const
Also your register the misc device before allocating the buffer so it can
be opened in theory before the alloc is done and crash.
