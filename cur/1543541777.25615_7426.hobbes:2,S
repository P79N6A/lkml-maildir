: > there could also be a stream /mnt/streamfs/WinNT/file.

: I can see three reasons easily:
:
: First, namespace issues.  What if the filesystem is your root
: directory?  How do you get at the streamset for it?  (This is
: relatively minor.)
Namespace is a non-issue.  If your mountpoint is /mnt then you know have two
directory structures underneith.  It just pushes the mounted fs directory
structure down.  I see you point but I also think that most people will not
be mounting a NTFS fs as the root fs.
:
: Second, performance.  Any time you want to see if a file is on such a
: partition, you have to look at every directory from / down to the file
: itself, and see if any of those are one half of a twin mount, before
: you can decide.  This gets even knottier if you have to handle
: symlinks.
Do not do symlinks.  And most performance, I believe is less of an issue
that compatability with existing software.  Also as the number of streams
per directory in the streamfs part will be relatively low, scanning of the
directories for streams will be fairly quick.
:
: Third, principle of least surprise.  If you move a file in one spot,
: do the corresponding elements in the other fs also move?  Do you have
: any security issues related to race conditions because the two
: filesystems are tied together?
:
Do the same as the underlining filesystem specifies.  So If i have file
/mnt/fs/x and stream /mnt/fs/x and the normal behaviour for the filesystem
is the keep the names of the two the same, then do so.
: Having parallel directory structures is an awkward solution at best.
: Having them fork at the mount point combines some of the worst
: features of the various proposals that have been floated.
:
I agree that it is awkward, but it does allow one to utilize today's tools
without rewriting them.
