Unfortunately, I don't think the correct configuration is currently 
checked into the binutils/gcc tree. I'll talk to Bob (he is the 
maintainer for binutils+gcc for Xtensa) when I have a chance (Monday is 
  Independence Day). It compiles fine with a local copy of binutils+gcc 
with the correct configuration.
BTW, I really like your website. Are you planing to release the script 
files?
Thanks,
