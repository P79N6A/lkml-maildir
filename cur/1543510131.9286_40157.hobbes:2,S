That sounds like the interrupt latency problem is known to be a real
problem with Windows NT at least.  (Ask Victor Yodaiken, RTLinux guru).
It appears to have been fixed by recent work on Linux, and has always
been fine with the slightly specialised RTLinux.  (I say appears because
there are no guarantees with the method, but it does work well in
practice).

I should think it is very hard to do, because the ringing tone depends
on who you're calling these days.  At least for me.  I should think
that's why they dropped it.
If you know of a good algorithm for recognising ringing tones I'd
certainly like to know.
