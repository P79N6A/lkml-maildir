... if a ->release() callback is required anyway to fix it?  I see two
ways to handle it:
  (1) mandatory ->release() callback, drivers must make sure the stuff
      is not freed before the callback was called.  In that case the
      class_device can be left embedded inside the drivers provate
      structs.
  (2) optional ->release() callback (for those drivers which want add
      private attributes), "struct video_device" must be moved out of
      the drivers private structs then and released in a new function
      (which also calls the drivers ->release callback if present).
      Should probably also be allocated by videodev.c for symmetry.
Both approaches require touching all v4l drivers in non-trivial ways
through, not sure whenever it is a good idea to do that now.  Any chance
to get that in before 2.6.0?  Or should I better make that change in
2.7.x and live with /proc for the time being?
