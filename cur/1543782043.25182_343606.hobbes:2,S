The issue I have with that logic is that you seem
to use "kernel" in a general sense without regard
to what its doing. Dropping packets is always
detrimental to the user regardless of what he's
using the computer for. An audio stream that
drops packets isn't going to be "smooth" at the
user level.
All of this aside, I need to measure the raw
capabilities of the kernel. With 'bsd OSes I can
tell what the breaking point is by driving the
machine to livelock. Linux seems to have a soft,
floating capacity in that it will drop packets
here and there for no isolatable reason. I'm
having difficulty making a case for its use in a
networking appliance, as dropped packets are not
acceptable. How do I tune the "its ok to drop
packets when x occurs" algorithm to be "its never
ok to drop packets unless x occurs" (such as a
queue depth)? Is it possible?
