    I thought that it was implemented per filesystem.

    Which approach does 2.6 kernel use? O_DIRECT is correctly handled
for ext3 there, AFAIK :? Are the differences too large?
    I know that this change would be intrusive and probably large,
but IMHO is a quite important bug, because it prevents apps to
selectively disable O_DIRECT (the flag is accepted by open(), so
there's no reason the app should bother about which caused the
read()/write() failures. In fact, is very difficult to know that
those failures are caused by partial/buggy support of O_DIRECT flag).
    Thanks for the information! :)
