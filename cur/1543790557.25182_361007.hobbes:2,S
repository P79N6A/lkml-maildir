Yes, and PAE works fine with a 32bit kernel.  I agree it is a silly
configuration and a 64bit kernel would use the memory more
efficiently.  My basic point was that a dual-core is a recent enough
processor from AMD that it supports memory remapping.  So with a
correct BIOS there should be no problems.
