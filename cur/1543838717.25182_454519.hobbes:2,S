OK, thanks.  FWIW here is the serial board we are using:
http://www.moschip.com/html/MCS9845.html
The hardware guy says "The mn9845cv, have in default 2 serial ports and
one ISA bus, where we have connected the tl16c554, quad serial port."
Hopefully Ingo's latency tracer can tell me what is holding off
