... but making the anonymous pages use an object based
scheme probably will make things too expensive.
IIRC the object based reverse map patches by bcrl and
davem both failed on the complexities needed to deal
with anonymous pages.
My instinct is that a hybrid system will work well in
most cases and the worst case with mapped files won't
be too bad.
cheers,
Rik
