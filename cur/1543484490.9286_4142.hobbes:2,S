Since this is a FAQ
Raw Hide uses glibc 2.1 betas. Raw Hide glibc should(!) run all your applications
Raw Hide binaries use glibc 2.1 betas so they may not run with glibc 2.0.7
If you want to use RawHide binaries without a library update get the SRPM 
package and do
rpm --install whatever.src.rpm
cd /usr/src/redhat
rpm -ba SPECS/whatever.spec
rpm --install RPMS/i386/whatever.i386.rpm
to get binaries built for glibc 2.0.7
A similar procedure goes for any other RPM based dist.
