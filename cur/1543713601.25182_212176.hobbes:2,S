Hi Ulrich,
> The old code depended on undefined behavior.
Thanks for explanation.  It makes perfect sense.  I appreciate it.
Our bad assumption was that using signal to install a signalhandler on a 
specific signal unblocked that specific signal, but as you show it does not.
I will try to get a fix using sigsetjmp/siglongjmp or fork/wait into the 
forthcoming OOo 1.1.2 tree so that no more "problems" are reported.
Kevin
