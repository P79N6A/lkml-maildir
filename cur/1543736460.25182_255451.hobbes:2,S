Ok. BTW I've fixed this in the current SVN codebase
to do the right thing (return st_blocks expressed as
bytes).

Ok, right now the only smb server that supports the UNIX
extensions is smbd (I'm working on getting NetApp to also
support them, but they don't as yet so we can get them to
do the right thing, bytes allocated, when they do), so we
know pretty much what will happen.

Not much, sorry.

It has to deal with Samba sending bytes allocated on disk (from st_blocks),
rounded up to the nearest 1mb (or whatever the local admin compiled with,
but most people don't mess with that compile-time parameter) or starting
with Samba 3.0.8 it'll send the value from the server st_blocks expressed
as bytes. So it doesn't have to be too bad (I hope).
