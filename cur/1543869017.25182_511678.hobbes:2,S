you can do just about anything from a threadlet, using bog standard 
procedural programming. (Certain system-calls are excluded at the moment 
out of caution - but i'll probably lift restrictions like sys_clone() 
use because sys_clone() can be done safely from a threadlet.)
The code must be thread-safe, because the kernel can move execution to a 
new thread anytime and then it will execute in parallel with the main 
thread. There's no other requirement.
Wrt. performance, one good model is to run request-alike functionality 
from a threadlet, to maximize parallelism.
