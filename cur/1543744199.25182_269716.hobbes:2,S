Hi,
I got this on a Centrino box with the latest bk:
  [kay@pim linux.kay]$ ls -l /sys/devices/system/
  total 0
  drwxr-xr-x  7 root root 0 Nov  8 15:12 .
  drwxr-xr-x  5 root root 0 Nov  8 15:12 ..
  drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 0 Nov  8 15:12 cpu
  drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 0 Nov  8 15:12 i8259
  drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Nov  8 15:12 ioapic
  drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 0 Nov  8 15:12 irqrouter
  ?---------  ? ?    ?    ?            ? timer
It is caused by registering two devices with the name "timer" from:
  arch/i386/kernel/time.c
  arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_pit.c
If I change one of the names, I get two correct looking sysfs entries.
Greg, shouldn't the driver core prevent the corruption of the first
device if another one tries to register with the same name?
Thanks,
Kay
