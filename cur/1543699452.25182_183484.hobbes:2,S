Let's take a fresh look, from a historical perspective...
We had a GPLed kernel with (lots of) GPLed drivers. Even too many drivers,
since a kernel with all drivers enabled is too large to fit in 640 KiB! (of
course we elitist m68k users didn't suffer from that limitation ;-)
So someone solved this problem and found a way to reduce the kernel image size
below the magical limit by moving driver code to `loadable kernel modules'. A
nice side-effect was that people (read: distributors) now no longer needed a
bloated kernel that took ages to start during device probe. They could provide
a small kernel instead, with separate driver modules for all possible hardware,
to be loaded at boot time or on demand.
Hence technically loadable kernel modules are just a work-around to allow
larger kernels, and all loadable kernel code should be treated the same as
in-kernel code. So they are clearly derived from the kernel.
Later people started to realize that:
  (a) They can build out-of-tree modules, i.e. drivers that can't even be built
      in,
  (b) They can build out-of-tree modules and make them non-GPL.
And (b) is where the problem started...

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
