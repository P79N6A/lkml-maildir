True. Doing a BTSL in a bitmap would be probably faster to check
bytes in a switch. Or maybe gcc should do that, but it doesn't.
But I doubt the small performance advantage of that for an still quite 
obscure path is worth the code uglification that would be require to do
it without gcc support.
To put it into perspective:
signal exception path is thousands of cycles, we're talking about tens
of cycles here.
