Oh well, it was wishful thinking anyway. ;)
I see two potential solutions:
* Ideally, I'd like to find a character (pipe?) that isn't used in the
  Apple OF compatible property. I've been unable to find any
  documentation that specifies to this level of detail. (Well, without
  paying for the IEEE-1275 reference, and it may not even be there.)
* Looking at other hotplug agents, it seems acceptable to use $DEVPATH
  to read attributes directly from sysfs. This wouldn't be difficult to
  add to my macio agent, but doesn't seem as nice.
To be frank, my experiences with OF are limited to getting my airport
card to work with this code. That was the initial goal, and I figured it
was code other people might want to use as well. If someone has the
answers to these questions, it would be appreciated.
