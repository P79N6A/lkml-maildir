NAK.
You cannot make 32 bit BIOS calls in a 64 bit OS.
This will (and does) segfault on x86-64 (tested on my Aspire 5020, where  
call_bios wistron-btns just segfaults on x86-64 with this patch).
This is a known issue, and the reason why wistron-btns (and the out-of-tree 
acerhk) have not been ported to x86-64.
