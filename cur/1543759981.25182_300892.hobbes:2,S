This check will catch only if there is no block on the disk. In the
current test case, the filesize = 3K and filesystem blocksize=4K.
So, we have a block (beyond filesize). The test tries to read 4K.
None of the checks catch this case and it submits 4K IO.

Andrew, please don't apply the original patch. We shouldn't even attempt
to submit IO beyond the filesize. We should truncate the IO request to
filesize. I will send a patch today to fix this.
Thanks,
