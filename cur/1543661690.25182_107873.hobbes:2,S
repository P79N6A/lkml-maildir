In this case the issue is not a broken mailer, but rather the improper
use of a good one.  Mark is using Evolution and so am I.  It appears
that he did a cut and paste from an xterm (or something similar) which
converted the tabs to spaces.
For other Evolution users out there, a better way to send patches with
undamaged whitespace and not line-wrapped is to choose Insert and then
Inline Text File.  This will send a Linus-compatible inlined (not
attached) patch.  
Here is Mark's patch again, sent from Evolution, and not
whitespace-damaged:
