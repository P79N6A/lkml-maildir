Subject: [Kernel 2.4.26] Booting from Adaptec PCI-X 133 29320 Rev C

Hello everyone,
we can not boot from an "Adaptec PCI-X 133 29320 Rev C" device when 
using 2.4.26. We get a kernel panic and that the kernel could not 
mount root (VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:03). With 2.4.25 
everything works properly (its the same config) but we need the 
security patches included in 2.4.26.
I have not found any entries in the changelog about changes in the 
scsi drivers.
Thanks in advance,
Jason Brian Friedrich
