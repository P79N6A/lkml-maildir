Yep, I would say it is.
Yann, could you try the following patch to see if it makes it better for
you.  I added SA_NODELAY so that the timer is run in interrupt context,
and removed the shared flag, because I have no idea what might share a
timer interrupt, and it might cause other bugs.  If something needs to
share this interrupt, then we need to do something else.
Since I don't have any arm boards, I cant test it, so this wasn't even
compiled.
