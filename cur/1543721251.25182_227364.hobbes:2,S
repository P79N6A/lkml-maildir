Good patch, it should be merged.  That handoff code actually
predates general availability of BIOSes handling _any_ EHCI
controllers, and your patch resolves a problem I'd seen on a
newish board but hadn't yet had time to track down (beyond
knowing that broken BIOS handoff was the issue).
Thanks to you and Stuart!
