We want to aim for a depth of 1 in each chain, so that, assuming the
hash is decent, we'll achieve O(1) lookup complexity.  That is why we
want the number of chains to be at least as large as the number of
active routing cache entries we'll work with.

That's true, 512MB is just too much.  So let's define some reasonable
default cap like 16MB or 32MB, and as current it is overridable via
rhash_entries.
