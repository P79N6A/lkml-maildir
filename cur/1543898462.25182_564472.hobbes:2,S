Hi,
This doesn't appear to be a CFS problem.  I can reproduce the problem
easily in virgin 2.6.22-rc7 by starting xterm-spam at nice -1 or better.
As soon as xterm-spam can get enough CPU to keep the xterm fully busy,
it's game over, the xterm freezes.  The more accurate fairness of CFS to
sleepers just tips the balance quicker.  In mainline, the xterm has an
unfair advantage and maintains it indefinitely... until you tip the
scales just a wee bit, at which time it inverts.
