Sorry, but that's false. Not treating ATAPI the same can at most
complicate it, but in no way prevent.

Eh, so you are just going to treate the local network differently? ;-)

Because at least on Linux, the NAMES are the primary identifier for user
space, not numbers of some virtual SCSI buses which don't exist in the
real world anyway.
For everything else (well, except network interfaces, but that's a different
story), we refer by names. Even when using the SCSI devices for other
purposes, we refer to them by names. Why should burning a CD be different?
I believe that this is the crucial question and the one you should
answer first, before trying to force others to share your view of the world.

No, you are just wrongly considering something to be a global view,
which it in fact isn't.
				Have a nice fortnight
