Actually I think the discussion of disable_irq/enable_irq should say
something along the lines of "don't use these, if you think you need
them, think again, if you still think you need them, think again real
hard".
enable_irq/disable_irq are quite expensive and should not be used
except for very special cases. I'd claim that 99.9% of the time people
are better off disabling interrupts directly on the device (most sane
hardware has a bit to disable it) or using spin locks.
