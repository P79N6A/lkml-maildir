Hello Stephen,
Sorry for the long delay in replying; other things intervened.

I applied this against 2.6.12-rc4, and it fixes the problem 
(and I've also teasted various other facets of file leases 
and this change causes no obvious breakage elsewhere).
Are you going to push this fix into 2.6.12?
Cheers,
Michael
