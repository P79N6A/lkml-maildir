I think that PortInfo and NodeInfo might be fair game for sysfs files,
because they are actually defined in the IB spec with a binary format
that is sent on the wire.  So they're not going to change.
On the other hand it's not clear to me why using that wire protocol as
an interface to userspace is a good idea...
