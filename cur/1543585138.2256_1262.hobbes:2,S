Grrr...I hate these kinds of inconsistencies.  They don't belong there. 
Whether a driver is a module or compiled in should not effect whether or not
an attached device is considered valid.

This is the case for what I was seeing (but, all of the offline entries used
up all 40 SCSI disk structs that were available for use, so if I brought
another controller online there would be no available disk slots).

All modular, but none of the disks on mine ever got the error you are
mentioning.  Could possibly be because my root disk is on an aic7xxx and the
array on a qla2x00 that I did *not* let be included in the initrd so I could
bring it up after the rest of the boot was complete.  This, of course, implies
that sd_mod was loaded well before the qla2x00 and if I read your above
comments correctly, that means it scanned the array from someplace other than
scsi_register_device_module() and hence didn't get hit by the problem you are
referring to.  In fact, I would guess the problem you are referring to only
happens when a driver module is loaded prior to sd_mod.o, and that reversing
the order will solve the problem (but, I haven't looked so I could easily be
wrong ;-)
