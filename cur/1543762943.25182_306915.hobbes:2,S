Thanks for the patch.  I'll comment on the second patch later.
Are you sure that 12 bytes is enough for all cases? It would seem
to be safer to use the formula in deflateBound/compressBound from
later versions (> 1.2) of zlib to calculate the reserve.

We normally put the operator on the preceding line, i.e.,
while (foo &&
       bar) {
