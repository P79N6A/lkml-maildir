Yeah this is true.

I guess part of the problem is this process is still relatively new and all 
the pointers I'm used to no longer apparently apply.

In atleast one case of my scenarios it's not heh.  I've no choice but to 
take 2.6.15(.x) but I have to build custom debian installers and maybe 
still bring in newer e1000 sources from intel (still awaiting that build to 
finish to find the results of that) but there's issues with devfs there 
too, the only machine capable of testing needs devfs to boot and mkinitrd 
fails miserably at the moment, and I'm not sure why, which I am 
investigating more fully as well.
Like I said the problem from my point of view is needing a few trivial 
changes, but having to take a whole new ball of wax, and all the testing 
and verification work that takes for the hosting environments (maintaining 
multiple kernels internally was long ago given up because it's impossible 
to keep track of easily) here because we have to go completely away from 
the vendor kernels and for the places where I'm maintaining embedded 
(admittedly mostly x86 devices are my primary responsibility, though lately 
I've been signed into a few ARM projects) though is the most painful since 
there is a need to track the current kernel with bugfixes, and there's no 
vendor to act as a buffer, and no central place to find these 
updated/patched kernels which also measns if we make changes that cause us 
to become a fork we might be legally bound to atleast provide a patch for 
the core portions under GPL.
