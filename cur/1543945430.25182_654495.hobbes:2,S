Maybe, though that will involve fixing all the arch versions which do
different things. In fact, I'm not even sure I can tell you 100% after
the fact on ppc64, I have to double check.
I'd rather stick a flag in there to be safe, also since altstatus isn't
always there (which is why I used nsect in the test patch I sent to
Guennadi). I'm pretty sure I can rely on all MMIO controllers having an
altstatus but I'd rather still make that explicit with a host flag to
avoid unintended consequences to others.
