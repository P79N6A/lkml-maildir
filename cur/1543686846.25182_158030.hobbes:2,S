Is it clear that this is a win over having a regular thread to
perform the system call for you? Its obviously a lot more complicated.
I _think_ what you describe is almost exactly what KSE or scheduler
activations in FreeBSD 5 does. I haven't yet seen a test where they
significantly beat regular threads. Although I'm not sure if FreeBSD
uses them for asynchronous syscalls, or just user-space thread
scheduling.
