Hans, it seems you misunderstand what is going on.
Necessary prerequisite for reiser4 inclusion is a review by file system
people. Christoph is doing this _work_. You know what it is to review
somebody else code? It's a hard work. He is doing it for free.
If he goes away---reiser4 wouldn't somehow magically be immediately
included into kernel. It'll wait for review---for the next person to
come and to do this work. And that person will most likely point to the
very same things that hch does now only after a delay. Maybe with
slightly more polished style (hair style included) though. :-)
So, please be a little more patient.

This is not what is being discussed, stop red-herring, please.

Somebody has to review reiser4 code. If you can persuade somebody else
to do the review, do this.

One way in which half-OS was superior to DOS was how spectacularly the
former project failed after a lot of hype. :-)
