Makes sense.  Of course, nothing prevents an attacker from
introducing malicious loaders, since the loader is an unprivileged
user-level program.

Ok.  That justification makes much more sense to me.  Thanks.  So it's
not really about preventing a malicious attacker from executing a program
on a noexec partition; it's about mischance rather than malice.
That suggests that the question to Stas should be: Do these programs that
you're trying to make work count as example of accidental execution of
binaries on the tmpfs, or are they deliberate execution knowing full well
that the noexec flag is set and damn the consequences?  (If that makes any
sense.)

Right.  Agreed.
