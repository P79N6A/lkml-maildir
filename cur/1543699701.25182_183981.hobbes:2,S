Greetings!
While doing a BIOS-Update for my board, I have tried to read/write an 
msdos-formatted disk with kernel 2.6.0-test11. It can be mounted without 
errors - but "ls" shows only garbage. The disk is 100% ok - and can be readed 
with kernel 2.4.x without problems. 
I have done some more investigation with that. I can format a disk with e2fs, 
even with msdos - both *seem* to work correct - data can be stored and readed 
- but if the disk have been formatted with msdos on another system it cannot 
be readed with test11. 
So I started to do a diskimage with "dd if=/dev/fd0 of=disk.image" 
- and found some interesting differences:
While kernel 2.4 produces a file of  1474560 bytes,
test11 produces a file of 737280 bytes only.
Comparing these files I found:
from offset 0x00000000 to 0x000013FF  -- no difference.
but... surprise ! 
The diskimage done with kernel 2.6.0-test11 shows the directory of the disk - 
beginning at offset 0x00001400
while it is expected at position 0x00002600 
(where it can be found when read with kernel 2.4)
The directory is followed by 0x00 bytes - next data is found at offset 
0x00002400 -- data, that can be found at offset 0x00004800 in the original 
image.
I can give more detailed information if needed.
Confused but not hopeless (hey, rest of test11 is works a charme here - :)
