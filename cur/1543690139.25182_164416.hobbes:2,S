Replying to myself, apologies to all for the previous noise.
I hadn't looked at the error closely enough.  My previous post was not
apropos to Anton's specific problem.
Try doing this from /usr/src/linux:
grep dep_ 3rdparty/lufs/Config.in
You'll see various lines with something like:
dep_tristate ' Some prompt' CONFIG_SOMETHING $CONFIG_SOMETHINGELSE
The $CONFIG_SOMETHINGELSE may be missing on some line.  You can kludge
it by changing the dep_tristate to a plain tristate.
The Mandrake 9.2 rc2 is out now, so you might want to look at that
instead.
