Before I can fix the problem, or pound on the vendor, I have to be aware
that the problem exists. I need automated system monitoring for that,
and the system monitors must have a quick and efficient way to get at
the information. 
Once I know the problem exists, and before the vendor has solved it (in
which they are not always as responsive as one would like), I need to be
able to implement an automated temporary fix (e.g. bouncing the parent
process). The automated operations framework needs to recognise that the
problem is occurring again, and therefore needs to get at the
information.
Obviously the problem are the closed source applications. It is usually
not possible to dump an application that has been selected for
functional/business purposes because of a minor technical
problem/nuisance.
