Erm, this *IS* possible.
excerpt from `man lilo`:
---
       /sbin/lilo -R - set default command line for next reboot
-R command line
   This option sets the default command for the boot loader the next time it executes. The boot loader will then
   erase  this  line: this is a once-only command. It is typically used in reboot scripts, just before 
    calling  shutdown -r'.
---
/etc/lilo.conf:
image = /vmlinuz-stable
        label = Stable_Kernel
        root = /dev/hda1
        read-only
image = /vmlinuz-test
        label = Test_Kernel
        root = /dev/hda1
        read-only
---
test_kernel.sh:
#!/bin/sh
lilo -R 'default=Test_Kernel' && reboot
---------------------
Normally, LILO will boot the first image listed (in this case, the Stable_Kernel) by default.
However, running 'test_kernel.sh' will -- for one time only -- make the default kernel be the Test_Kernel.
The only thing left is to make the kernel (or, if something goes wrong there, userspace) reboot if something isn't working okay.
