Yeah, sorry about that.  I was using ironic understatement, but it's not 
something that comes across well in email.

Yes, but it doesn't solve the fact that there isn't really anything 
special about ld.so, so putting special checks into it doesn't really 
solve the overall problem.
Also, I guess there's the general question of what the noexec mount flag 
really means?  Does it mean "make the execve syscall fail", or does it 
mean "no bits on this filesystem may be interpreted as instructions".  
The former is simple to implement, but probably not very useful; the 
latter is not possible to implement in general.
