That there are performance improvements because of quicklists.

x86_64 is only using a list in order to track pgds. There is no 
quicklist without this patchset.

x86_64 should be using quicklists for all ptes after this patch. I did not 
convert pte_free() since it is only used for freeing ptes during races 
(see __pte_alloc). Since pte_free gets passed a page struct it would require 
virt_to_page before being put onto the freelist. Not worth doing.
Hmmm... Then how does x86_64 free the ptes? Seems that we do 
free_page_and_swap_cache() in tlb_remove_pages. Yup so ptes are not 
handled which limits the speed improvements that we see.

I would expect this functionality (never thought about it as an allocator) 
to extract common code from many arches that use one or the other form of 
preserving zeroed pages for page table pages. I saw lots of arches doing 
the same with some getting into trouble with the page structs. Having a 
common code base that does not have this issue would clean up the kernel 
and deal with the slab issue.

That would reduce performance. I did not think that a common feature 
that is used throughout many arches would need rejustification.
