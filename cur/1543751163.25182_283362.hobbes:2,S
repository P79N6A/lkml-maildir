Yes, these are all UP cases, so at least for the sh and sh64 cases these
specific changes are fine.
sh ripped out the save_and_cli() mess a long time ago (during early 2.5
before Linus added the UP compat stuff), so these at least shouldn't
have been there in the first place (mpc1211 wasn't added until after the
fact however and seems to have gotten overlooked).
Anyways, I'll apply these patches to their respective trees, thanks.
