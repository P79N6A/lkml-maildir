No, if kobject_add() fails, kobject_put() still must be called in order
to free up the name pointer, unless you are somehow guessing that the
"kobject_set_name()" portion of kobject_add() somehow failed.  And you
can't know that, so you have to call kobject_put() in order to be safe
and clean up everything.
Now why did we not do the final kobject_put() in kobject_del() as well?
Doing two calls, always in order, seems a bit strange, anyone know why
it's this way?

Yes.

Ok, good, I might get this right yet :)
