Man, it can do a ton more than that.  This patch is just a stopgap
to prevent the oops.
page_cache_release() goes out onto the bus for the PageReserved()
test and then immediately goes out onto the bus again to perform the
atomic_dec_and_test().  Plus it tends to do all this inside
a global lock.  That PageReserved thing needs to go away.
Seriously, this stuff needs a truck driven through it.  See
http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-mm/2002-07/msg00009.html
 and things
like pagevec_release().  It still needs quite some work, but the
optimisations which are available here are considerable.
