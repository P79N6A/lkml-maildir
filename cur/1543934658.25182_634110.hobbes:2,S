It looks like this is a shell issue.  After looking through the sysfs
code, I realized that this problem seems to be driven from user-land.
So I performed some experiments:
     1. Wrote a simple program that just used write(2) to write to the
        sysfs entry. This works fine.
     2. Used /bin/echo instead of the built-in echo command.  This too
        works fine.
     3. Tried several shells.  Zsh and Bash both fail.  Csh works fine.
I then ran strace on the following shell-script:
#!/bin/bash
echo x > allow_restart
echo y > allow_restart
echo z > allow_restart
and got:
# strace -e trace=write ~/tmp/tester.sh 
write(1, "x\n", 2)                      = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
write(1, "x\n", 2)                      = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
write(2, "/home/andrew/tmp/tester.sh: line"..., 72/home/andrew/tmp/tester.sh: line 4: echo: write error: Invalid argument
) = 72
write(1, "x\ny\n", 4)                   = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
write(1, "x\ny\n", 4)                   = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
write(2, "/home/andrew/tmp/tester.sh: line"..., 72/home/andrew/tmp/tester.sh: line 5: echo: write error: Invalid argument
) = 72
write(1, "x\ny\nz\n", 6)                = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
write(1, "x\ny\nz\n", 6)                = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
write(2, "/home/andrew/tmp/tester.sh: line"..., 72/home/andrew/tmp/tester.sh: line 6: echo: write error: Invalid argument
) = 72
write(1, "x\ny\nz\n", 6x
y
z
)                = 6
Process 3800 detached
As you can see, subsequent echo commands have their arguments appended
to the previous command. So it seems that the shell is not resetting the
buffer between failed echo commands.
