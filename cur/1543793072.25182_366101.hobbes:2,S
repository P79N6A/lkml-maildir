I had no such problems here.  My script patches 2.6.14 to 2.6.14.1, then
to 2.6.14.2.  It built and I'm running it right now.
I don't believe the .2 patch I saved from the email includes the .1
patch.  I didn't get the bz2 version however, so it could be combined. 
Somone else will have to clarify that.
