we're talking about NFS here (but also local CDs and potentially CIFS
etc). The level of security you're talking about is going to be the
same before or after cachefs.... very little against local root.
Frankly, any networking filesystem just trusts that the connection is
authenticated... eg there is SOMEONE on the machine who has the right
credentials. 
Cachefs doesn't change that; it still validates with the server before
giving userspace the data.
