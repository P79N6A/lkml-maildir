Unfortunately I see nothing like this when the machine crashes. Find attached 
my config, which has CONFIG_4KSTACKS and the options you specified. Are you 
sure this is sufficient to enable it?
Here is an extremely bad digital camera pic from the crash. My debugging 
prowess has evolved to the stage where by I'm using a maximum res vesafb 
console.
However, I'm not at work so it's my own digital camera that I'm using rather 
than work's, and it seems to react badly to the LCD. I hope you can read the 
numbers, if not I'll try to transliterate them for you.
