Hmm this propasal is not without reaons but the main obstacle
is currently just the option parsing code in ide. At some
point in time I just intend to rewrite it and to support
namings along the way of /dev/hdXX, where XX are simply digits.
The old names will be preserved as "backwards compatibility".
OK?
If you wish you could of course look in to this yourself, since
it's not *that* difficult. I would be really glad if someone did this.
