   I think in this case it's because I try to keep the v850 arch files
   identical on 2.4.x and 2.5.x (as much as is possible), which sometimes
   results in unused #defines on one or the other.
Please don't do that, 2.4.x and 2.5.x are different kernel.
There will be differences, just accept them.
Some of us use grepping tools to see if arch's depend upon
deleted interfaces still existing, and once we start adding
exceptions such as yours the tools become less and less useful.
Therefore, please delete the flush_page_to_ram define on v850.
Thank you.
