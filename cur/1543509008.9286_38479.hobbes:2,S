Hi,
I use RedHat 6 and I upgrade my kernel from the 2.2.5
to 2.3.17.
when I finished upgrade, I can't config my sound card:
Sound Blaster PCI 128.
I have setup the module for sound card.
another problem is there is a APM daemon failed when
my start linux.
what's the APM? Please help me to resolve these two
problem.
Thank you!
Jack
