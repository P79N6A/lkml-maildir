I reboot each of my machines every week, to take them offline for
intrusion detection.  I use 2.4 because I need advanced features of
iptables that ipchains lacks.  Because the 2.4 VM is so broken, and
because my machines are frequently deeply swapped, they can sometimes take
over 30 minutes to shutdown.  They hang of course when the shutdown rc
script turns off the swap.  The first few times this happened I assumed
they were dead.
So, unlike what certain people like to repeatedly claim, the 2.4 VM
problems are causing havoc in the real world.
