I looked at it and 'arch/arm/Kconfig' does not source few entries: 
- of - does not appear on ARM if enabled
- macintosh - does not appear on ARM if enabled
- telephony - drivers for ISA/PCI/PCMCIA so can probably be used on some
              ARM platforms
- infiniband - like above(?)
- edac - does not appear on ARM if enabled
- auxdisplay - basically it is for one LCD controller connected to x86
               parallel port - safe to have it sourced on ARM
- uio
Including of 'drivers/mtd' depends on "ALIGNMENT_TRAP || !CPU_CP15_MMU".
Including of 'drivers/ide' depends on "PCMCIA || ARCH_CLPS7500 || 
ARCH_IOP32X || ARCH_IOP33X || ARCH_IXP4XX || ARCH_L7200 || 
ARCH_LH7A40X || ARCH_PXA || ARCH_RPC || ARCH_S3C2410 || ARCH_SA1100 || 
ARCH_SHARK || FOOTBRIDGE || ARCH_IXP23XX" but 'drivers/ata' (which can be 
used instead on PCMCIA enabled platforms) does not depend on such set.
Does it look like 'drivers/mtd' require extra check 'if ARM then check for 
ALIGNMENT_TRAP || !CPU_CP15_MMU' and probably extra check 
in 'drivers/ide'?
I hope this info will help (test in 2.6.24-git 
488b5ec871191359b9b79262a3d48456dae7ea5f).
