     You can use su -c to run a command as a specific user.
     I would be happy if I could get this to work even AS root.  Under 2.2.10:
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),6(console),0(wheel),51(staff)
# echo 16384 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
# ulimit -nH 2000
ksh: ulimit: bad limit: Operation not permitted
#
     Values below 1024 work fine.  Under 2.0.35 I had the kernel compiled with
NR_OPEN set to 2048 (and some other tweaks were necessary).  I tried upping the
value of NR_OPEN to 2048 and when I booted that kernel after adding swap it
said something about getting unused fd 0 not NULL, something along that line
several times then hung. 
     Can anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong?
