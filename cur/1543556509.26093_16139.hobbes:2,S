The kgcc compiler is merely gcc 2.91.66, and it most definitely
compiles the kernel correctly.  If yours is failing, then you are
doing something wrong or have the wrong version of something else
interfering, or perhaps some other problem.
Provide a larger screenshot wher it actually shows c ompiler
build lines, errors, etc..  Also check that you're using the
proper versions of stuff as listed in Changelog.
What specific kernel are you building again?  Is it stock or
patched?
