cool!
could you perhaps also do an add-on:
> +	/* test 1: read the value */
> +	/* test 2: write to the variable; this should fault */
> +	/* test 3: check the value hasn't changed */
           test 4: make it writable again
           test 5: make it NX -> check that it's not executable
and perhaps also check that normal kernel allocations (kmalloc(), etc.) are NX as well? (with the same section trick you use in 
this patch - perhaps try to call a kmalloc()-ed buffer that contains a 
'ret' instruction - if that call faults then the test is OK, if the call 
succeeds then the test failed.)
