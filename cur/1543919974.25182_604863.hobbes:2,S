Bug report for 2.6.23-mm1:
scsi8 : pata_amd
scsi9 : pata_amd
ata9: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x1f0 ctl 0x3f6 bmdma 0xffa0 irq 14
ata10: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x170 ctl 0x376 bmdma 0xffa8 irq 15
ACPI Exception (exoparg2-0442): AE_AML_PACKAGE_LIMIT, Index
(0FFFFFFFF) is beyond end of object [20070126]
ACPI Error (psparse-0537): Method parse/execution failed

ata9: ACPI get timing mode failed (AE 0x300d)
ata9.01: ATA-7: Maxtor 6L250R0, BAH41G10, max UDMA/133
ata9.01: 490234752 sectors, multi 16: LBA48
ata9.01: limited to UDMA/33 due to 40-wire cable
ata9.01: configured for UDMA/33
ata10: port disabled. ignoring.
libata-Bug, ACPI-Bug or just bad code in the BIOS?
The detection of the 40-wire cable is correct, also that there is only
one drive at this IDE port.
pata_amd is build as module and is driving the IDE part of a nVidia MCP55.
