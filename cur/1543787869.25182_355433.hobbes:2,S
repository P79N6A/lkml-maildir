Different open transport hardware will expose the underlying network at 
different levels.
Hardware A might provide direct access to SSP and IDENTIFY/CONNECT frame 
handling, while Hardware B may handle that internally, while still 
providing full SMP access for the transport layer to discovery topology 
and build its routing table.
We cannot assume that all open transport hardware will function the 
same, hence the better approach is a library of helpers that function in 
concert with LLDD to form a transport layer.

For the 1001th time, we know all this.
