In the who cares department: this idea was one of the main reasons I founded
BitMover, it's what we wanted to do before we got sidetracked by BitKeeper.
So you have my vote, and if anyone does this, I'll be pissed as hell because
I wanted to do it, but happy that it's getting done.  If you look at lmbench,
it's basically designed to measure all the crud that you would need to make
this sort of thing go fast.  So I've been thinking about this for at least
6 years.  Sigh.
