I had thought about that as well, but then my answer was that if the 
space is that important on the floppy, then we (meaning Red Hat) could 
compile out BOOT kernel with whatever option gave the smallest compressed 
image and compile installed kernels with whatever gave actual best 
performance (with a + given to kernels that have a frame pointer in the 
event of a tie or insignificant performance difference).
Of course you may be talking about a system that always boots from floppy 
and sits in some closet for years or some embedded system where that 4k in 
flash is super important, so situational decision rules apply ;-)
