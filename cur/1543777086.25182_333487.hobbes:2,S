I tried this last night and enabling the OS2 memory hole in the bios doesn't 
work.  That's the only memory hole option available.  If I were more savvy 
with the kernel memory layout, I might try passing it a set of memmap 
options, but I'm not very familiar with what address spaces I need to set up 
for the kernel or how much space they need, or if there are any rules 
concerning what goes where.  (i.e. the difference between reserved, ACPI, 
etc.)
Thanks anyway for the suggestion,
Jon
