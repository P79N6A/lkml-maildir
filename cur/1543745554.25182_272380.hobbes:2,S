Subject: [patch 4/4] Uml: fix __wrap_free comment.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/18/346

Reworded the comment about __wrap_free detection of the allocator used to
allocate the pointer (it can free a pointer created by either the host
malloc(), kmalloc() or vmalloc()).
Signed-off-by: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade_spam@yahoo.it>
