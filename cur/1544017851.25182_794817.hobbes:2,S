Well, yes.
Suppose someone cleanups issues mentioned and make it at least look like
usual Linux driver.
And then it likely will turn out that driver is so misdesigned that
it will be faster to just rewrite it.
I'm very certain this will happen because it's a Windows driver.
Now why waste time doing cleanups when the risk that cleanups will only help
to see it's misdesigned is so high? I can't think of a Linux person mentally
dragging himself through issues mentioned to see the end result, it's very hard
to read such code after reading much Linux code.

No, too early to write policies.
