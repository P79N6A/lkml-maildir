hrm :/
ironically, i've got another box here (440GX dual pIII-500) running
linux-2.2.20 with apic enabled that doesn't have this problem.
interestingly, the NMI line from /proc/interrupts only lists counts for
CPU0, not for CPU1.  and it's sitting comfortably at 0.
running with 'noapic' on the troublesome machine still produces NMIs and
random hangs.
