RH7.3 manpage is quiet old, btw.
Linux manpages-1.54 (Dec 30 2002):
   The  (Linux-specific) SHM_REMAP flag may be asserted in shmflg to indi-
   cate that the mapping of the segment should replace any  existing  map-
   ping  in  the  range starting at shmaddr and continuing for the size of
   the segment.  (Normally an EINVAL  error  would  result  if  a  mapping
   already  exists in this address range.)  In this case, shmaddr must not
   be NULL.
