I cannot get my two PCMCIA cards to work.  On boot, I get the message:
Nov 14 23:00:15 paulus Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
Nov 14 23:00:15 paulus options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
Nov 14 23:00:15 paulus ds: no socket drivers loaded!
None of the PCMCIA wireless modules seem to work.  In addition, I get the
  following errors when trying to manually load the aironet modules:
/lib/modules/2.5.47/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/airo.o: unresolved symbol wirele
ss_send_event_Rdc9b8ae0
/lib/modules/2.5.47/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/airo.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.5.
47/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/airo.o failed
/lib/modules/2.5.47/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/airo.o: insmod airo_cs failed
Any ideas what might be causing this?  The kernel's pretty sweet; I just
  need networking to work.  It actually fixes a problem I've been having
  with USB in the 2.4 series (get only timeouts when connecting a USB device
  after a reboot).  I'd like to use it full-time, but I need the networking,
  erm, working.
Thanks!
