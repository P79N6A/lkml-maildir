i want to add a few more things that i have tried
i looked at the function filemap_fdatawrite and followed the function
calling at got to do_writepages which was in turn calling either the
i_mapping->a_ops->writepages or generic_writepages with the parameters
mapping and wbc
i copied do_writepages as it is in my code and gave i_mapping in place
of mapping and defined a structure of struct writeback_control with
syncmode = WB_SYNC_ALL, start = 0, end = 0, nr_to_write =
i_mapping->nr_pages * 2 and non_blocking = 1 the values of start and
end are given 0 in __filemap_fdatawrite and syncmode = WB_SYNC_ALL is
given in filemap_fdatawrite so i just gave the same values
i have seen that i_mapping->a_ops->writepages is assigned
generic_writepages and generic_writepages calls mpage_writepages
