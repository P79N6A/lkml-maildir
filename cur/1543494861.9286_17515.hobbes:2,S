I don't think the offender is RTL8139 but instead some packet-driver for
the nework that seems that it's missing simply one kfree_skb() somewhere.
What are you using in the network side (TCP/IP?)? Could you should be the
configuration of the network? To get this fixed faster I should know which
is the packet-driver that is generating the leak (arp, IP, whatever).
Please apply this patch against 2.2.7 and let me know which are the most
used packet driver that you are using:

You'll get tons of numbers in the kernel syslog, grab the most shown ones
and resolve them via System.map.
If your system.map looks like this:
c0160cb0 T arp_bind_neighbour
c0160d08 T arp_send
c0160ef8 t parp_redo
c0160f0c T arp_rcv
c0161254 T arp_req_set
c01613e8 t arp_state_to_flags
c0161408 t arp_req_get
c01614d0 T arp_req_delete
c01615f8 T arp_ioctl
c0161818 T arp_get_info
and you see many `c0160f0c' in the syslog you must tell me `arp_rcv' ;).
