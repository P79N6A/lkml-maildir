Amen to Alan's comments but to Kendall... you've spanned the heights of
incredibility here! You have Linux kernel source code which is freely available
but you want the kernel folk to completely revamp their development program/path
to suit your own needs? Since you have such an excellent understanding of what
needs to be done why not use the source and do it yourself... that would solve
all of your problems! If releasing the source code to your drivers doesn't suit
your business model then don't play in the Linux space or do so and provide your
own support as Alan has said. I fail to see why the OS community needs to
support your proprietary source and business model. When you talk about `binary
portability' it makes me shiver... I left that world behind by choice and
personally do not want to revisit it and the idea that Linus and Alan are
`forcing' you, or any other vendor to implement Open Source device drivers is a
joke. The onus is on you to choose to do it or not. If the economic model for
your outfit dictates that your source remains closed, that's fine, but don't
then ask the Linux community to support your efforts! If that's Linus and Alan
twisting your arm then go ahead and add my name to the list as well!
