Maybe. I didn't investigate the subdirectory semantics too
closely because at the time I wanted something that could
work in both 2.6 and 2.4. Hence the self-contained ioctl()
on a char-misc device approach in perfctr-2.6.
A file-system open() solution needs:
1. A simple predictable file name that denotes your own task.
2. Given a task id (however it's retrieved, but it's not getpid()),
   a file name that denotes that and only that task.

I'm biased :-) but I think the main reason had to do with
systems with many thousands of threads, which may have
made /proc and tools like top and ps behave poorly.
