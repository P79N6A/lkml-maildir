Well, you need to pass 'num' argument I guess.
But... How is this supposed to work on 64 bits arches ?
Because of alignment, 'struct sample' will include a 4 bytes filler after 
'unsigned num', and sizeof(sample) will include this (null) filler in entropy 
pool.
Shouldn't we use __attribute__((packed)) on 'struct sample' definition ?
