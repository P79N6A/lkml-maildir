Subject: [UPDATE] Zerocopy patch of the day...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/2/2/30

In the usual spot:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/zerocopy-2.4.1-2.diff.gz
Changes:
1) Merge in 3c59x update from Andrew Morton.  I hope Andrew won't
   mind if people who see problems due to these changes at least
   CC: him on bug reports? :-)
2) Correct receive buffer space checks during direct user
   copies.
3) Correct returning of errors in datagram wait_for_packet(),
   cures DoS discovered with AF_UNIX sockets.
And yes, before Mr. Wedgewood asks, the generic fixes (#2 and
#3) will be sent to Linus seperately when he returns from NYC.
:-)
I will soon start keeping a real ChangeLog.zerocopy file going at the
same place you get the patches from.
Later,
David S. Miller
