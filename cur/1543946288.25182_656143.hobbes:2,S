Because XPMEM needs to be able to sleep during its callout.  For that,
we need to move this outside of the page table lock and suddenly we
need the begin/end pair again.  There was considerable discussion about
this exact point numerous times.  We tried to develop the most inclusive
design possible.  Our design would even be extendable to IB, assuming they
made some very disruptive changes to their MPI and communication libraries.
IB would suffer the same problems XPMEM does in that the TLB entries
need to be removed on a remote host which is operating completely
independently.
Thanks,
