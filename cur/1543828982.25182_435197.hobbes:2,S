All of these are conditional branches, if the branch is not taken you
have to do a cleanup.

You misunderstood me here. I'm not talking about storing the same piece
of data to memory on each processor. I'm talking about isolating all
other cpus so that the initiating cpu can store the breakpoint to memory
without running into the danger that another cpu is trying to execute it
at the same time. But probably the store should be atomic in regard to
instruction fetching on the other cpus. It is only two bytes and it
should be aligned.
