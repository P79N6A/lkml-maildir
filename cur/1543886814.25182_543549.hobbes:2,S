Yes sure. Quoting myself,

This is another story, I can't comment because I am not educated enough.
However, in my opininon THAT PATCH has nothing to do with this problem.
It just improves the code that we already have.

Yes. See the "Quoting myself" above.

It is not perfect. Rafael tries to improve it.
Do we need freezer? Should we freeze kernel threads? I can't judge. I tried
to read a long thread about suspend, and failed to understand it.
I personally think we can simplify things if CPU-hotplug use freezer, at least.
