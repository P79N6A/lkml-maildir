Your code now looks nice and clean. But I don't know what you want. I
already spent lot of time on version 7 I posted and contains all those
corrections which were suggested for my earlier version. I cannot ask
you to look into possible problems (if any) in my code now since  you
are not interested in that anyway. So, please continue this
duplication.
Thanks,
Nitin
