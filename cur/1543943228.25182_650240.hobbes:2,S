Al posted the following:
====================================================================
; cat >a.c <<'EOF'
const char foo[] __attribute__ ((__section__(".blah"))) = "";
const char * const bar __attribute__((__section__(".blah"))) = "";
EOF
; gcc -m32 -S a.c
; gcc -m64 -S a.c
a.c:2: error: bar causes a section type conflict
;
That's 4.1.2 on ppc.  What happens is that the second declaration
wants to make .blah writable.  We actually trigger that in ppc64
builds on drivers/net/natsemi.c.
Note that on ppc64 without explicit sections you have the second one land in
.data.rel.ro.local, which is "aw",progbits.
====================================================================
Se we see that despite being marked as const the the section
is in one case marked as read-only by gcc and in another case the section
is marked as rw.
And this is with the gcc version that is in use today and which
we must support.
Thats why I think we have to loose the constification that is going on
or we should loose the section attribute on the data.

No.
