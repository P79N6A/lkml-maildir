Subject: persistence of kernel object attribute ??

I've been looking at everything I can find, asked a few questions, and don't
have an answer to the following issue.
I have a driver that wants to export attributes per instance. I'd like the
ability for the user to modify an attribute dynamically (sysfs works well) -
but I'd like the new value to be persistent the next time the driver
unloads/loads or the system reboots.  I don't want to have to update
constants in source and recompile the driver.  I'm looking for something
similar (cringe!) to the MS registry.  Is there a facility available to
kernel objects to allow for persistent attributes to be set/retrieved? If
not, any recommendations on how to implement this ?
