But since it didn't do what it was supposed to from the beginning some
people don't want to change it because it might open up security holes
and I can understand that. So maybe we need some new flag for
applications to say "I really want to do this" and noone can say we
break old interfaces (mess upon mess...)

Yeah it's related to changing user IDs, it's me who is lost, sorry.
And I still think having apps being able to keep a chain of capabilities
would be very useful, most noticeable pam_cap so that normal users can
have capabilities like chroot, running SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, mlock
etc. But let's see what Chris has to say about another flag for explicit
inheritance.
