I've updated my x86 performance-monitoring counters patch.
The current patch is against kernel 2.3.5.
Summary follows:
* Version 0.2 1999-06-07
* - Added support for WinChip CPUs.
* - Restart counters from zero, not their previous values. This
*   corrected a problem for Intel P6 (WRMSR writes 32 bits to a PERFCTR
*   MSR and then sign-extends to 40 bits), and also simplified the code.
* - Added support for syncing the kernel's counter values to a user-
*   provided buffer each time a process is resumed. This feature, and
*   the fact that the driver enables RDPMC in processes using PMCs,
*   allows user-level computation of a process' accumulated counter
*   values without incurring the overhead of making a system call.
* Version 0.1 1999-05-30
* - First public release.
