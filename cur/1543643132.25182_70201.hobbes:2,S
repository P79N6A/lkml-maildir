I was just think (feel free to point out the errors of my way):
what if we used the time a program was started as a guide? The last
programs started are killed of first.
That would mean that init survives to the last, as would the daemons
that are started when booting.
Alternatively, suppose we get a very large pid-space, and at the end of
booting there's something like
echo "5000" > /proc/sys/minimum-pid-from-here-on
Then, you could do:
echo "5000" > proc/sys/oom_lowest_pid_to_try_killing_first
in other words, protect a part of pid-space against oom-killing.
How this all works with threads, forks, child-processes etc etc is
beyond me - I'm just thinking a bit.
