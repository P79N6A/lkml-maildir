I'm also seeing this behavior on an HP Omnibook 6000 laptop running Red
Hat's latest release of 2.6.9 - same kernel version as the above poster.  
Upon resume, the keyboard malfunctions but the touchpad works fine. It
happens with either ACPI or APM.  (I did notice that during ACPI resume,
the machine spits out several error messages from atkbd.c to the kernel
message log - when I've next got serial console access, I'll post them 
here.)
This behavior happens about 2/3rds of the time that the machine comes out
of suspend.  It did not occur with any of the 2.6 kernels that shipped
with Fedora Core 2 before FC3 came out.
