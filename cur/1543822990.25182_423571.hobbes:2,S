There are some backlight drivers in the kernel. Currently however the only 
supported device is Sharp Corgi.
Would it be possible to make DPMS signalling a backlight driver? (Without 
the APM overhead.) vgacon for example leaves the backlight on while in X11, 
DPMS is enabled and signals standby after the timeout.
