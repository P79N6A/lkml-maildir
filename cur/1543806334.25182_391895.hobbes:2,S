Because we have native drivers which do not require SCSI stack et all.

Please _reread_ this paragraph:
* some devices (not cd-writers) doesn't work with ide-scsi
* they require quirks which are in ide-cd so it ide-cd needs to stay as a driver
* if is very useful if cd-writing can be done with ide-cd and without SCSI stack
  (a hack but very useful one)

From technical point of view:
pros:
* you don't need SCSI stack (a lot of code saved!)
* you use subsystem native driver (a lot of complexity with locking
etc avoided!)
* you don't need to provide users with fake data (SCSI lun and bus)
cons:
* user-space applications need to support it
What are the _technical_ problems with SG_IO interface besides
issue with enumaration of devices available in the system?
I know that you don't like SG_IO but it is hardly technical argument.
Thanks,
