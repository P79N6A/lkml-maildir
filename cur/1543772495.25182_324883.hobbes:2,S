Oh, right. that makes a lot of sense ... maybe just let it have an error
factor when migrating cross numa nodes (ie not be as strict)? Not sure 
that's really the problem, as I doubt anything in my test is actually 
niced anyway (assuming you're meaning static prio, not dynamic). In that
case, your changes should have no effect, right (from explanation, not
looking at the code ;-))
