Hi,
I did get the nvidia blob to work, with some help, and tried mmiotrace
on it. Worked perfectly. The machine is Thinkpad T61 with a Core 2 Duo.
Mmiotrace disabled and enabled the extra core without a glitch, and did
not even drop any events with the default ftrace buffer size. Previously
while tracing Nouveau, I had to increase the buffer size, which worked
well, too.
I did a second trace run after doing
echo 1 > /debug/tracing/trace_entries
and as expected, it lost a lot of events, but showed no problems. Then
I disabled mmiotrace while in X, the 2nd cpu core came back online, and
everything was good. Losing events is logged into the kernel log once
per mmiotrace activation, and into the trace whenever noticed.
(On athlon64 3000+, x86_64:)
Earlier I tried unaligned accesses with testmmiotrace.ko, by mapping
from an odd start address and doing 8, 16 and 32 bit reads and writes.
There were no crashes, and at a page boundary it resulted in a recursive
probe hit, which was resolved by disarming the both pages. Only one page
is re-armed, so the other page is left "blind", but did not seem to
harm stability.
Conclusion: green light from me!
