Its really hard to tell. The 3200 has a bigger cache too if I remember
rightly. If you are planning on buying big boxes for this you might want
to ask the vendor if you can do a test run or two.

Yes. You would probably want to tie different cards/encoders to
different processors and the IRQ to the same one. You can do this via
/proc and with the -ac or most vendor trees (and 2.5) you can tie
processes to CPUs with syscalls
