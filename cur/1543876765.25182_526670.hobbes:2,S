No, NCQ was designed to optimize *server* workloads:  lots of *small*,
random I/O's.
But WD drives, in particular the Raptor series, have a firmware "feature"
that disables "drive readahead" whenever NCQ is in use.
So they will perform poorly only any medium/large sequential access
if NCQ is employed.  Which is why the custom MS drivers avoid NCQ when
doing large sequential accesses.  Ours don't do this, yet.
