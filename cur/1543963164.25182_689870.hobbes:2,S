Ok. I think this _really_ point to a kernel problem.
(or just some broken hardware from Sun in multiple copies)

Now I've moved the data to fresh ext3 filesystems on a storage-array
based on iscsi. Mounted the filesystems to another, similar server and
I can still reproduce the problem.
Both servers are 16 cores. The problem wasn't there on a different 
server with only 2 cores. (or I didn't run into it).
The 3 setups above has both been tested with a 2.6.22-14-server and 
2.6.24-17-server (towards the iscsi volume).
Doing more testing show that I have 3 machines (all X4600, 16 cores/32GB 
ram that I can reproduce it on against different filesystem)
The more processes running on the system (accessing the FS volume), the
easier it seems to get into the problem.

Now I've removed all of them.. and still got the problem.
