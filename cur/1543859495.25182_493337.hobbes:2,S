Master right  now is at 54851157ac.
But I use the master site of kernel.org, and the public site mirrors 
probably haven't mirrored out yet.
Sometimes it can be worth it trying "git2.kernel.org" rather than 
"git.kernel.org", because the way the DNS round-robin works (badly), git1 
seems to get a lot more load than git2, so sometimes git2 gets updated 
before git1 does.
