The NSLU2 is based on a IXP420 processor that can change its endianess.
I suppose Markus has installed the debian-arm distribution on his NSLU2
so it is configured as little-endian.
Nevertheless, I took a look at the code of quickcam messenger that is in
usbvideo/
This macro: RGB24_PUTPIXEL puts in memory the following bytes:
                *pf++ = (vb);
                *pf++ = (vg);
                *pf++ = (vr);
vb, vg, vr are blue, green, red values.
Since the driver is still v4l1 this can be normal(?)
Cheers,
Thierry
