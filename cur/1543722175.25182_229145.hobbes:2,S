At some time in the distant past, it must have been a brute force
attempt to debug some *serious* problems. I've never had the
need to enable those checks in the last 6 years.
I agree with your thought, and will be removing them from at
least the synclinkxx drivers. The checks clutter the code
with little gain. And cruft like that keeps propogating to new drivers.
