Hallo!
With new 2.4.0-test11 kernel i have the problem with NVdriver-0.95:
depmod: *** unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.0-test11/video/NVdriver
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test11/video/Nvdriver:unresolved symbol in put_module_symbol
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test11/video/NVdriver:unresolved symbol in get_module_symbol
Please, could you explain me, how i can find in patch the #define's lines
with this symbols, that was cleaned from kernel, so that i can place that
lines by myself in future.
Thank you !
