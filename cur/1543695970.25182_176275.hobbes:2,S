On a kernel 2.6.0-test9 as an NFS client I am having trouble transferring
data to and from NFS servers. It it extraordinarily slow.  I receive the
following information in dmesg:
nfs warning: mount version older than kernel
nfs: server safe not responding, still trying
nfs: server safe not responding, still trying
nfs: server safe not responding, still trying
nfs: server safe not responding, still trying
I have also upgraded util-linux to 2.12pre
I am using various NFS servers, Solaris 2.8, Solaris 2.6, linux 2.4 and of
all things a windows server with NFS. It seems to suffer when connecting to
any one of them. 
I have built from the default 2.6.0-test9 source.
