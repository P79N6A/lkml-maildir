There must be a reason for this. One "non-standard" option in my setup is in /etc/exports:
/p2/backup              192.168.1.1(rw,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
Can the "no_subtree_check" be a cause?
What kernels are you using (client,server)?
I am pretty sure we can find the thing, stuff here is pretty straightforward and problem is continously reproducable on several clients.
