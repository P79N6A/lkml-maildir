There have been some updates in the radeonfb that are needed for some cards (especially mobility cards) to work.
The fixed version of radeonfb is in the ac-kernels, but not in the current 2.4.19-rc2.
Any chance that it will go into 2.4.19 final?
I'm talking especially about this patch, which is important for radeonfb to work on my machine for example:
