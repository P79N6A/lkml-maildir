Actually, most modules do not need to be unloaded. I don't know about
firewire (I don't use it), but certainly 8139too contains proper
suspend/resume support, I even had no problems suspending with yenta_socket
and orinoco_cs card. As of now: no modules unloading at all. Anyway, the
crash is not swsusp related.
