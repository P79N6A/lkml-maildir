I finally found the bad drive (the most obvious one as I would expect,
it was recycled from an older box...).
I tried removing completely the drive from power and controller, and then
running with it powered but not connected. No single error any more on
any of the other 3 drives. I have been updating my distro, rebuilding the
rpm database, moving big files between drives, even all at the same time.
No error.
I can't believe it, but a bad drive was causing timeouts on other drive
_on other controller_, the bad one was attached to the Promise and the
good ones on the ICH5 SATA (both integrated in motherboard).
Or there is a strange interaction in my board (Asus PC-DL), or there is
a nasty bug in the kernel...
