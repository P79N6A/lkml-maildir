Because I was working on the assumption that the driver would no longer be
serial.c and would use only my card, I may have done some things that
weren't exactly the best practice.  This is partially why I am trying to
figure out the "correct" way to use the new serial driver.  Because I went
with the entire serial.c file, I don't think that I can post it.  However,
you can get my modifications here:
http://support.commtech-fastcom.com/fcap335_07_11_2005.tar.gz.
  I renamed
the serial.c file to fcap_335.c and I changed the devnodes to be
/dev/ttyFCx.  I think every modification that I made has a comment //mds
near it.
>Despite being the maintainer for the serial layer, I'm not on linux-serial.
Right, I am on linux-serial and I had seen a couple of posts from you on
linux-serial, I kind of assumed that you were there too.
Thanks,
