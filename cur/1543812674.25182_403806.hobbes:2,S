I just build and booted a plain 2.6.16-rc5-mm2 with the same config
I've used previously, but with the following options disabled :
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
CONFIG_PAGE_OWNER
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
The resulting kernel boots and runs just fine (no Oops) and leaves
nothing in dmesg.
So, without the debugging options it appears to the user that
everything is OK - nasty.
