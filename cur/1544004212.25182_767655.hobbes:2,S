This seems to compile:
int y;
char x[__builtin_constant_p(1) ? 42 : y + 1];
so yes, that might work.  For this gcc version.  However I suspect that
it would blow up on us.  We keep on having problems with the
__builtin_constant_p() in kmalloc() doing wrong things (with gcc-3.2.x,
iirc).
It'd be worth trying though.
DIV_ROUND_UP() and roundup() are busted too.
