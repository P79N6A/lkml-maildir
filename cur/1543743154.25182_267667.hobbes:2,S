Thanks, do let me know if it helps or not.

Not really, the problem is that the sleep call returns after so many
timer ticks, so even if the wrong amount of time has passed, you'll see
the same number of interrupts. It would be best if you checked the time
on your watch, waited 5 minutes and checked again, or better, did
something similar w/ ntpdate.  I just wanted to eyeball it to make sure
you weren't running away w/ way too many timer interrupts. 
thanks
