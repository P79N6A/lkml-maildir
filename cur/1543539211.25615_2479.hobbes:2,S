I think I know what the problem is. Could someone try X 4.01 with the
NVIDIA fbdev driver. Then set the video mode on the console to match the
bpp of the video mode you start X in. The resolution doesn't have to be
the same. Just the color depth.
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
