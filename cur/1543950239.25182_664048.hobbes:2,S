The (mis)alignment does makes it look that way,
but no, it's not an overflow in this case.

Well, what else would you want to use that space for?  If there were
a compelling reason to tune it according to how much physical memory
you have (and you're right, that we want a good surplus of address
space so as to avoid silly limitations by fragmentation), I guess
that could have been done.  But why bother if there's no reason?
It's a hard life, there's just too much room to spare in 64-bit ;)
