Interesting. How many total partitions do you have ? I ask this because
David Alan Gilbert proposed a patch to dump the partition list on the
screen upon panic. Perhaps it's larger than the screen in you case ? If
you have more than 25 partitions, to you think they can fit with 2 or 3
columns ?

I wouldn't tell you that, I *hate* labels. It causes lots of problems
when you simply move some disks between machines.
