It's still down.  The machine got moved from one colo to another and when 
we went down there to find it it was nowhere to be found.  So they are 
tracking it down and we'll try and get it up tomorrow.
I've offered to update the rsync tree on kernel.org directly if HPA figures
out how to turn on my account (something I've been waiting on for at least
a year, hint, hint).
