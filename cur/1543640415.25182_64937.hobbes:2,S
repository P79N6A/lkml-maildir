What you describe sounds exactly like what you would see if the console
output was redirected to somewhere else. For example, if you set LILO to
use (also) the serial port and add a serial console to inittab but not
redirect the console output to the serial port you will see exactly what
you describe on a terminal connected to the port.
Check what is set as the console and what parameters are passed to lilo.
Did I pass the challange? :-)

A 'woke up screaming' nightmare about working for Linux Corp. inc. and
having the Marketing dept. file an ECO that you remove all those pesky
boot message because it scares the lusers? ;-)
