Subject: 2.3.38 bugreport: ethernet not working

After upgrading to 2.3.38 my HP-PLUS ethernet card doesn't work:
hp-plus.c:v1.10 9/24/94 Donald Becker (becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov)
eth0: HP-PC-LAN+ at 0x300, 08 00 09 66 1b 18 ID 0000, IRQ 9, programmed-I/O mode.
(the card is detected correctly), but ifconfig fails:
<root>:/root# ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1
SIOCSIFFLAGS: Try again
This occurred with ifconfig from net-tools 1.52 and now 1.54 after I just
upgraded it.
net-tools 1.54
ifconfig 1.39 (1999-03-18)
