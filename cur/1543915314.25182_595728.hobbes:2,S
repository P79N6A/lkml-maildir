and did they really do enough? if those names shouldn't be there, why
play childish games and insist on putting them in?

and what so petty is there? who can show what those two added to the
original work so that according to the law they are allowed to put
their names in there?

and who really cares about why you did this or did that? this OT
sentence sounded like real childish BC. if you want to have fun while
coding and share it with others - do it, if you want also to play
contract games - do it; choose BSD or GPL and go with it. however,
whatever you do you must respect laws. if the law says you can put
your name in only if much of work is done, so it must be. there are no
other variants. and everything will come back to you no matter whether
it is good or bad. if you ignore laws using somebody's work, the same
will be done to you one day.

P.S. Let's just say that BC like that is why I decided to work with
BSD instead of Linux 11 years ago.
