It looks like the program itself doesn't matter, since it's
bash that's eating up memory like crazy, until the point where
it is OOM killed.

Looks like your SCSI disk has some problems, you may want
to try running 'badblocks' on the swap partition to verify
that.  The VM doesn't appear to have a problem with your
test program, in my quick runs here.
ObLKML: I was running the test inside Xen, and that seemed
to hold up fine too ;)
