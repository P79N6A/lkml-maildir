I've done that and the problem is still there.  It no longer gives me the
perpetual link is up message when trying to mount storage on the fibre
channel disks.  Now it just stops.  I booted without any of the fibre
storage being mounted and ran an fdisk on the storage in question.  The
response from the ps -eo cmd,wchan is:
fdisk /dev/sdc lock_page
Hope this helps,
Cary
