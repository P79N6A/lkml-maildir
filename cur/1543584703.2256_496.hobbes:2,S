Subject: 2.4.2-ac16 PIIX4 ACPI getting wrong IRQ?

With 2.4.3-pre1, /proc/pci contained:
>   Bus  0, device   7, function  3:
>     Bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 1).
With 2.4.2-ac16, /proc/pci contains:
>  Bus  0, device   7, function  3:
>    Bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 1).
>      IRQ 9.
So the ACPI function of the PIIX4 is now being given
IRQ 9.  I don't want this.  I was using IRQ 9 for a
PCMCIA device.
So I tried booting the kernel with "acpi=off" and
"pci=irqmask=0x0800", but the result was the same.
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt says that
"pci=irqmask=0xMMMM ... sets a bit mask of IRQs allowed
to be assigned".  This parameter is being ignored.
[... searches through kernel sources ...]
Well I see that this is the result of a change to
/usr/src/linux-2.4.2-ac16/arch/i386/kernel/pci_pc.c
which looks deliberate:
< static void __init pci_fixup_piix4_acpi(struct pci_dev *d)
< {
< 	/*
< 	 * PIIX4 ACPI device: hardwired IRQ9
< 	 */
< 	d->irq = 9;
< }
What's going on?
