Anyway, the basic race-free wait loop looks like this (there are
variations, but this is one of the basic versions that you find in
various places):
if (should_wait_condition) {
add_wait_queue(..);
repeat:
current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
if (should_wait_condition) {
schedule();
goto repeat;
}
remove_wait_queue(..);
current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
}
There are only two important rules:
- you have to add yourself to the wait queue _before_ testing for the
condition.
- you have to mark yourself asleep _before_ testing for the condition.
