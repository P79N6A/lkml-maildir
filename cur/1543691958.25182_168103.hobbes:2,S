I did some more research on this subject. Indeed, I was wrong. The
problem is that when you acquire a buffer_head by calling
kmem_cache_alloc and you return it with kmem_cache_free the returned
buffer can be filled with any garbage *except* the b_reqnext field
which *should* be set to NULL, otherwise the next driver who'll get this
buffer_head will most probably crash.
Not that relying on this field being NULL is a bad practice (because
in kernel performance is top priority), but it's not clean (and
nowhere mentioned - even in the source code). So I think it would be a
Good Thing{tm} to mention somewhere(say at least in buffers.c before
put_unused_buffer_head) that before returning a buffer to the common
pool you should ensure that b_reqnext is NULL (although it is not
related only to put_unused_buffer_head but to kmem_cache_free as well -
but the later is not related to buffer_head's:).
Sorry for borrowed time and thank very much for assistance.
