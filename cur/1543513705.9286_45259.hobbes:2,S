That doesn't work.  You have to know what sort of memory the system will
need beforehand so the system can try to keep a pool of it around,
otherwise the amount of work required to free up a particular type of
memory is simply too much.  The way the allocator currently stands, it
wouldn't be difficult at all to add an arbitrary number of additional
memory lists (say 1 per bit of significance above 24 bits).  Practically,
I have to ask what the value in this is.  Do you really need to allocate >
16 MB in the normal use of a bloody sound card?
