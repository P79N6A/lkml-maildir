Yes, it is. bindings are asymmetrical. And that's the reason why they
work while links to directories do not.

Here's one more: you can't rename across the binding boundary. They _are_
mounts, so they avoid all that crap with loop creation on rename, etc.
Take a generic DAG and try to implement rename() analog on it. Have fun
catching the cases that would make the graph disconnected.
