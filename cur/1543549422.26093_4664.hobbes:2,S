[snipped trident problem report]
Interesting. 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi' should show the same
devices as 'cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_strs' [and 
'cat /proc/scsi/sg/devices']. If not, then the SCSI
mid-level is not calling sg_detect() [in sg.c] for
all new scsi devices detected by the mid-level.
The sg_detect() routine is silent for all devices that
are "owned" by other upper level drivers (i.e. disks,
cdroms and tapes) but outputs a line for any other
scsi type (e.g. scanners which are scsi type 6).
It is not clear to me what "hacking" sg requires as
Torben Mathiasen suggested in his response. This seems
like a mid level problem. I'll check with my scsi
scanner this evening.
Other random scsi notes:
  - scsi modules were completely broken in 2.4.0-test9-pre4
    but worked again in pre5 [Makefile hacks?]
  - the sd module's name has now reverted to its historic name
    of "sd_mod.o"
  - the imm module (scsi over parallel port for ZIP drives)
    works on a UP machine but locks up a SMP machine (until
    the NMI notices)
  - the sg "stall" problem (plugged queues) has not been
    addressed yet
