As I said before "I was wrong" (I use lockdep only with -mm kernels).

The problem with this bug is "bad interaction" between lockdep and
XFS. (I forgot about this probably because lockdep was broken for me
in 2.6.18-rc5-mm* - and previous bug appeared while mounting XFS, not
umounting).
2006-07-03 locdep was merged
2006-07-28 - 2006-08-10 a few XFS fixes
So I guess that binary search won't solve this mystery.
