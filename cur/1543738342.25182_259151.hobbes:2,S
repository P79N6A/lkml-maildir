I personally like to think of it from the top down.  The internal API I
came up with looks like:
create_domain(parent_domain, type);
destroy_domain(domain);
add_cpu_to_domain(cpu, domain);
So you basically build your domain from the top down, from your 1 or
more top-level domains, down to your lowest level domains.  You then add
cpus (1 or more per domain) to the leaf domains in the tree you built. 
Those cpus cascade up the tree, and the whole tree knows exactly which
cpus are contained in each domain in it.
I think these are the three main functions you need to construct pretty
much any conceivable, useful sched_domains hierarchy.
