If this is how is was expected to work - it isn't exactly what is 
currently implemented.
The function maxcpus in init/main.c sets a static variable max_cpus -
not the global variable maxcpus in the mpparse.c files.
How should it be?
Should max_cpus in init/main.c become global and replace the maxcpus 
from the mpparse.c files?
