It was my experimental change in the inode freeing. It's safe but I
removed it because it's not the best approch. So you won't see this
message anymore in my next arca patches.
Ah and if you see strange things with my arca patches please let me know
directly (just to make sure I'll read your email ;).
Thanks.
