... and the speed of the block device. The minimum of the two actually.
Usually we can reclaim memory *much* faster than the block device can
fill it. Didn't you read what I had said?

This is still many orders of magnitude faster than filling the page
from disk, and you typically don't reclaim much of mapped memory anyway.
We are sort of spamming lkml now so let's get this finished up.
If you want to talk about memory management basics, there should
be some more helpful lists.
