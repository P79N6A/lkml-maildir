All right, the above started to be reproducible, about once every 3 boots: the system freezes when
tries to initialize the ata sybsystem. (still don't have cable for the serial console, sorry)

Now this is 2.6.14.4 and the new config is:
http://linux.tar.bz/reports/oopses/char/2.6.14.4-K01_char.config
I added another 250GB SATA HDD and changed the PSU, but it does not seem to be related for that bug.
Will try to tweak the IDE parameters in BIOS.
