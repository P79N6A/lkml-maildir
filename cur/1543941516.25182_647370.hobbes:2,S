The data loss I experienced did go away with the back-port, but I think
that was because of the bigger buffers, rather than any true fix. Other
than the extra product ids, it won't really change anything. I'm hoping
the additional work I've done since then will correct the underlying
fault. (Wish I could get some feedback on it.) I'd be happy for you to
wait for that.
