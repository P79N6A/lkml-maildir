Hi
Should NForce2 boards also work without patches and with acpi/apic ?
I saw a change in rc3.
It just hangs again, so I switched back to my patched kernel.
But of course this could be another problem, kernel 2.6.2-rc1 is running very 
stable here with the apictack-rd and the ioapic-rd patches.
thanks
Felix
