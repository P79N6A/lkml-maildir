i've decided its high time someone removed every last trace of strtok()
from the kernel source (replacing with strsep() for thread safety), so
i've decided to do it myself.  quite simple stuff, but requires
extensive testing to be sure.  therefore, i'm not too keen on patching
2.4.x, but instead cleaning out 2.5.x.  if someone else is doing this,
or has any objections, shout my way please.
cheers,
	phil
