Hello,
my 1 GB PQI Intelligent Stick is often not beeing used by mass storage
driver when I plug it.
From a  fresh reboot it works, I see:
Jan  9 16:54:43 parachute kernel: usb 1-3: new high speed USB device
using ehci_hcd and address 2
Jan  9 16:54:43 parachute kernel: scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass
Storage devices
Jan  9 16:54:48 parachute kernel:   Vendor: I-Stick2  Model:
IntelligentStick  Rev: 2.00
Jan  9 16:54:48 parachute kernel:   Type:   Direct-Access             
        ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Jan  9 16:54:49 parachute kernel: sda: Unit Not Ready, sense:
then a lot of other stuff, and I can use it.
But if I unplug/replug it, it's not longer detected as mass storage
device. I can see 3 new USB devices detected when I plug it:
kernel: usb 1-3: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6
kernel: usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 4
kernel: usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 5
But it's no longer beeing detected as mass storage.
I have other USB 2.0 keys which are working perfectly. Moreover this
USB key seems to work properly on some other machines/OSes
In the attached file, full log and result of lspci.
