hello
kernel.org's 2.6.8-rc1 crashed upon wakeup of my lombard
and after reboot, later on, while booting MacOs under mol (which 
worked before), it even just did a poweroff.
(It's strange: somehow this laptop seems to trigger poweroffs with 
many kernels. it's definitely software related, as some kernels are 
completely reliable, but if the kernels are not reliable, the problem 
no. 1 is poweroffs. Or maybe no. 2 - the other most frequent problem 
are freezes (as usual).)
sorry for not having more info, i'm lacking time and have just booted 
back into 2.6.5 for now. (i'd be glad not to run a kernel with local 
holes, though..)
christian.
