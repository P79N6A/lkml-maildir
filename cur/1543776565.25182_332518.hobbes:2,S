Hi
My SCSI DVD-RAM is available as /dev/sr1. fdisk -l /dev/sr1 shows
for a certain medium:
Note: sector size is 2048 (not 512)
Disk /dev/sr1: 2496 MB, 2496430080 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 75 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 2048 = 32901120 bytes
     Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sr1p1   *           1          75     2409624    b  W95 FAT32
Note that /dev/sr1p1 does not exist. Neither does /dev/sdX.
Mounting /dev/sr1 does not work. However, I was able to mount the
partition with the following "trick":
# losetup -o 129024 /dev/loop0 /dev/sr1
# mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
Is it possible to make the DVD-RAM partitions available as device
nodes (or at least directly mountable without the losetup hack)?
One solution would be to make the device available as /dev/sdX and
/dev/srX. Is that possible?
Thanks for your help. If this is a known issue, I would appreciate
a pointer on that topic.
Here is some more information about my system:

pie-8.7.7.1))
