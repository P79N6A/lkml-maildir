Trade offs trade offs... 
Compare:
   int mr (unsigned int rate, int r) 
   {
     int e = 16+9;
     static int round[4]={0, 0, 0xffff, 0x8000};
     if (!rate) return 0;
     for (;  rate & 0xfc000000 ;rate >>= 1, e++);
     for (;!(rate & 0xfe000000);rate <<= 1, e--);
     return ((rate & ~0x02000000) | (e << (16+9)) + round[r]) >> 16;
   }
Dense code, right? Floating point in the kernel.... Aaargh. 
Compare that with one hundred and twenty heavily commented lines in
drivers/atm/ambassador.c ..... (A very neat driver, by the way,
although you don't need 120 lines of code to do the above....)
