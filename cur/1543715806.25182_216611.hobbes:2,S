Surely this can not be such a bad thing.
There's a lot of stuff flying around for the kernel that's not included
for one reason or another, probably because some maintainer doesn't like
it. What do people do? They patch it in by themselves.
If there's demand for something and someone provides it, what's the big
deal? It's still not supported by the maintainer, but it is maintained,
and it complies with standards.
Not that different from using some other scheduler or something than what's
provided in the mainline kernel. It can then be developed and possibly
make it into the mainline. Possibly. If the maintainer wants it.
Besides, Reiser4 was, and maybe is in the grand scheme of things, something
of the future and maybe interim solutions shouldn't be disregarded.

No-one takes away anyone's freedom of choice, in fact, the very idea of
free software has been embodied here.

If xattrs were there first, why wouldn't they be pre-existing?-)
If Reiser4 attributes are better and stand a chance at becoming the new
standard, you should by Bog stand behind them and embrace this competition.
Let SuSE keep their customers happy and have people see that Reiser4
attributes are better.

This is of course only natural. But you allowed this to happen in your
choice of license and that's not a bad thing. Quite the contrary.

Amen to that.
