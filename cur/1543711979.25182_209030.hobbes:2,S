Which is not a normal usage scenario.
Common scenario:
 suspend machine then go home/to bed
 BTW Pavel I'm not arguing that the code has to stay in without
 modification
 (e.g. massively stripped down or whatever). But this is one place where
 kernel code is a lot closer to Joe Enduser's awareness than is usually
 the case, so IMUO, the priorities shift.
 That said, this discussion seems to be necessary to refine what is
 necessary from what has been creatively evolved.
