With what workload?  lmbench ctxsw?  Who cares?
Look, if you're doing 100,000 context switches per second per then *that*
is your problem.  You suck, and making context switches a bit faster
doesn't stop you from sucking.  And ten microseconds is a very long time
indeed.
Put it this way: if a 50% slowdown in context switch times yields a 5%
improvement in, say, balancing decisions then it's probably a net win.
Guys, repeat after me: "context switch is not a fast path".  Take that
benchmark and set fire to it.
