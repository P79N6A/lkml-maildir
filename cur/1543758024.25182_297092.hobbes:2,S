Looks like a good change, especially since it reduces the total amount
of code (and the size of your patch).
Although, to make any potential merging easier, it is almost always
better to put those kinds of things in functions #ifdef'd in a header.
The fact that there are other #ifdefs in setup_bootmem_allocator() is a
partial excuse, but not a very good one. :)
