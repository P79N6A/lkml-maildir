In 2.4 init/main.c we have...
 * Versions of gcc older than that listed below may actually compile
 * and link okay, but the end product can have subtle run time bugs.
 * To avoid associated bogus bug reports, we flatly refuse to compile
 * with a gcc that is known to be too old from the very beginning.

#if __GNUC__ < 2 || (__GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ < 1)
#error Sorry, your GCC is too old. It builds incorrect kernels.
#endif
Note that I've elided the 9 from the minor version number. I also tweaked
the #define asmlinkage in whereveritis.h to look a bit more like 2.2, got
rid of the arch=bla switch to gcc, and built the kernel I'm using at the
moment with gcc 2.7.2.3. I'm looking for "subtle run time bugs". OK, I'm
desparate for entertainment. That's a given. Where should I look?
Everything I'm cognizant of so far is real pretty. I WANT BUGS! WHERE ARE
THE BUGS?
This is not a bogus bug report. This is a repeatable bug request.
Incorrectly yours,
