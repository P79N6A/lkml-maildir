I'm going to try to apply the arch patches, but I do not have an arm
board myself. I do have a PPC64 box that works, but that's about it. I
have a powerbook too, but that box has never been able to boot an -rt
kernel. Who knows, maybe this one will boot.
I will create an rt/arm and an rt/ppc branch for the specific changes on
each. I'll try to get them next week (maybe tomorrow if things go better
than planned).
