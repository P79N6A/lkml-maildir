Ok, that makes sense. It was what prompted my original statement that the
only thing I could possibly think of would be potential problems with
some motherboards but a look at the driver source shows no easy way to get
it above 6 interfaces so the problem is moot anyway. Simply changing
MAX_HWINT in asm/ide.c will not help because drivers/block/ide.c looks to
me like it stops looking for additional interfaces after the sixth one.
