But we do it the rcu way.
So it isn't the mangling that is a problem.  Just walking off into
freed memory.  That is fundamentally the principle that the rcu
accessors work on.
Any find_pid is in trouble because any intermediate pid in the hash
chain may be freed as we walk the list, and if we don't wait the rcu
interval the pointers we need may go bad.

We have to touch and recheck all of that code anyway to ensure
the pid namespace stuff is correct and working well.

Nope.  alloc_pid does also.  The pid_hash table is fundamentally not
protected by task_lock, but by pidmap_lock.
task_list only protects detach (by fluke) and going from struct pid 
to a task.  It doesn't prevent additions to the hash chains at all.

The patch is horrible because it works for all of the wrong reasons,
and obscures what is really going on.  That can't be good.
