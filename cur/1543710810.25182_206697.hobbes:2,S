It's with unpatched 2.6.4. Before that the machine was running 2.6.1-rc1

Perhaps there is a memory leak somewhere, and your systems just

Well, I can see something like that when I compile kernel with "make -j 15".
The system starts swapping like crazy, most processes are in the D-state
waiting for disk, but all goes back to normal after compilation is finished.
