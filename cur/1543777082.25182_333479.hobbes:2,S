I've booted with the patched kernel in the following way:
- BIOS option for mouse support still off ;
- Kernel commandline:
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.12-6mib7test root=/dev/evms/lv_racine ro 3 usb-handoff 
devfs=nomount noquiet vga=791
- USB mouse plugged to what I believe to be the USB 2.0 controller (according 
to the motherboard manual)
First thing I notice at boot is that "mouse doesn't work".
cat /proc/interrupts shows :
           CPU0

Looking at dmesg or /var/log/mesages shows a huge number of :
Jul 12 19:36:58 totor kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.2: IRQ, status = 0
Jul 12 19:36:58 totor kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.0: IRQ, status = 0
Jul 12 19:36:58 totor kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.1: IRQ, status = 0
Jul 12 19:36:58 totor kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.2: IRQ, status = 0
(3043 similar lines...)
...immediately at startup, then it stops complaining
The interesting thing is that I unplugged my USB mouse at 19:45 -- nothing 
happened, and plugged it back at 19:45:40, while looking at a "tail 
-f /var/log/messages"
And see what happened in the attached copy of my /var/log/messages for this 
session...
Doesn't mean anything to me ;-) but I hope it will be of some help for you...
Cheers.
