I am assuming that you can satisfy hpa's concerns about using a single
version of zlib for everybody.  Also note that arch/ppc/boot/lib has
its own version of zlib which is quite different to the others.  First
make sure that you can build one version of zlib that works for
everybody.
Configuring and linking zlib is a problem.  lib/lib.a is an archive
which means that the linker will only include zlib from lib.a if some
other code refers to zlib.  That breaks when all users of zlib are in
modules and nothing in vmlinux refers to zlib, the zlib code is not
linked into the kernel and modules get unresolved errors.  Linking
lib.a into the affected modules is not the solution either, the modules
would pick up all the code from lib.a instead of using the code in the
kernel with undefined results.
The best option is to build zlib.o for the kernel (not module) and
store it in lib.a.  Compile zlib.o if any consumer of zlib has been
selected and add a dummy reference to zlib code in vmlinux to ensure
that zlib is pulled from the archive if anybody needs it, even if all
the consumers are in modules.  Some of the zlib symbols will need to be
exported, I will leave that to you.
This should do the trick, completely untested.  It assumes that zlib.h
has been moved to to include/linux and zlib.c to lib.  Against 2.4.17.
