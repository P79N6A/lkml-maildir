As do I, I've never had a problem with a Vanilla kernel or one of 
Gentoo's maintained kernels.  Gentoo actually supports the 2.6 kernel, 
at least on AMD64 hardware that's all they support.  Though the vanilla 
kernels -do- work flawlessly, I still prefer the Gentoo patched kernels:

The k8/x86_64, broadcom, and bootsplash patches in particular make me 
happy.  They tend to stay within one or two minor kernel revisions of 
the current branch.  I've had production 2.6 servers for months.
