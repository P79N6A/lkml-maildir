Very clever move! And I see some people have catched this...
Since sched_yeld() is a very general purpose tool, it can be easily
replaced by others, of course, just like probably half of all
system calls. And such things are done often in a code during
optimization. But, IMHO, the main value of sched_yield() is it's
easy to use and very readable way to mark some place. Sometimes
even test if such idea is reasonable at all... Otherwise, many such
possibilities could easily stay forgotten forever.
But you are right, the value of this call shouldn't be exaggerated,
and my proposal was an overkill. Anyway, it seems, there could be
imagined something better than current ways of doing this. They look
like two extremes and something in between and not too complicated
should suffice. Currently, I wonder if simply charging (with a key
recalculated) such a task for all the time it could've used isn't one
of such methods. It seems, it's functionally analogous with going to
the end of que of tasks with the same priority according to the old
sched.
