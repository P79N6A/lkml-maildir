Tested the patch. Works and has the expected effects:
Fully preemptible kernel: 
No change: 500 us delay at rtprio 1, no delay at higher rtprio.
(you just moved the 500 us piece of code from one rtprio 1 kernel 
thread to another rtprio 1 kernel thread).
Kernel with desktop preemption:
Originally: Threads at any rtprio suffered from 500 us delay.
With your patch: Only rtprio 1 threads suffer from 500 us delay,
no delay at higher rtprio.
