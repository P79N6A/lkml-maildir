Hmm, I had thought about this, but thought people might not like
another #ifdef. But then this kind of thing is very idiomatic throughout
the kernel, so ok, I'll do this.
[ BTW that .id field also looks like it can be gotten rid of altogether.
I was using it to print informational / error messages in the store()
operations below, but I guess I'll just use config_item_name() there
as well. ]

Ok.
[ BTW: not related to dynamic netconsole / issue at hand, but ... I
just noticed in fs/configfs/item.c that ci_name is set to point to
embedded ci_namebuf array in config_item_set_name (if name was small
enough to be set in ci_namebuf itself), which is called from
config_item_init_type_name(). So, this keeps ci_name and ci_namebuf
in sync for such items.
However, for items that are statically initialized (often the
group->cg_item members of subsystems or default groups) we often simply
set ci_namebuf and then call config_item_init() -- say via
config_group_init(), like I've done with the netconsole subsystem in this
patch -- but config_item_init() does not set ci_name for such items to
ci_namebuf. This means the ci_name member of _initialized_ config_items
with their names in ci_namebuf is left un-initialized (NULL, actually,
because the subsys / default group would likely be static).
This doesn't really affect dynamic netconsole, because all config_items
that will be checked in the get() / put() check above are targets that
were initialized with config_item_init_type_name(), but something to
think about for perhaps other users?
Perhaps users who want to statically initialize their config_items must
be asked to just use ci_name and avoid ci_namebuf altogether? ]

Right. We shouldn't special case (at least not without adding a comment
why that would be right) and we never know what might happen to the code
at some later day. So let's keep the get() / put() pair.

Hmm, netpoll_parse_options() currently prints these separately as and
how it walks through the input string parsing it. But changing that to
just print all these out together at the end if / when the parse is
successful seems better than what it's doing right now. I'll do this too.

Yes, an indent would be good there.

Yes. That special-casing was really ugly and unnecessary -- we just need
to hold the lock around list_add(). I was going to set that right in the
next iteration myself.

Right, this looks neater and is again the idiom followed throughout the
kernel.
