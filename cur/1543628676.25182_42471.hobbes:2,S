Subject: Possible bug with UDP and SO_REUSEADDR. Was Re: [PATCH] zerocopy NFS updated

Seeing this mail from Hirokazu my curiosity triggered, I'd never
contemplated using reuse on a udp socket. 
However writing a test server that stand in blocking wait on a UDP
socket, and start two instances of the server it's ALWAYS the server
last started that get the udp message, even if it's not in blocking
wait, and the first started server is. 
Smells like a bug to me, this behavior don't make much sence. 
Using stock 2.4.17.
