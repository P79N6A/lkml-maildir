with the difference that for address spaces one of the preferred methods
of operation is read() [or sendfile(), or any other non-mmap() operation],
while for pagetables the hardware helps to get locking-free access to the
mapped contents.

it's not just databases. It's webservers too, serving content via
sendfile() from a single, bigger file. Think streaming media servers,
where the 'movie of the night' sits in a single big binary glob.

using read-write locks does not solve the scalability problem: the problem
is the bouncing of the spinlock cacheline from CPU to CPU.
