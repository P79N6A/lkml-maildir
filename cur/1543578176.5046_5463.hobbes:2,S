   Perhaps tcp can merge internal 4K requests, but if you're doing udp
   jumbograms (or STP or VIA), you do need an interface which can give
   the networking stack more than one page at once.
All network protocols can use the current interface and get the result
you are after, see MSG_MORE.  TCP isn't "special" in this regard.
