That's ok initially. We can probably split up functions
somewhat or do other tricks to reduce the number of
ifdefs later on.
Alternatively, we could do the splitting first and the
nommu merge later. I don't really care about the order
as long as things don't happen simultaneously in patch
that's too big to check ;)
