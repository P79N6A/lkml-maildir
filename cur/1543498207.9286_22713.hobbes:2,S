<groan>  Sorry, I should know better than to test anything following a
beer at the end of a long, hot day..  The problem persists in spades!
Now, instead of merely locking the process in a D state, it hangs the
entire machine when attempting to delete a file from the mounted samba
share :-(.
Naturally, I didn't have my other box setup for logging the serial console
at the time.  I'll try to capture an oops this evening if no one has
figured it out before then!
So, to reiterate, 2.2.9-ac3 with the above-mentioned patch is still broken
with regard to smbfs.  2.2.9 works fine.
