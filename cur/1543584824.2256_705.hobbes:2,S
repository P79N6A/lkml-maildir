I see the problems. I just pursposed a new cursor api soe we can have a
clean fbdev to fbcon abstraction. Also we really need to move the curent
cursor code in fbcon.c:fbcon_startup. They really belong in their
respected drivers.

Many drivers use spinlocks to manage access.

Yuck!!! I see this also a problem for VBL dependent drivers. Some
drivers to require you sync with the VBL to do things like change
the color map. Worst some of these drivers require you poll a bit
to see if the VBL occured.
