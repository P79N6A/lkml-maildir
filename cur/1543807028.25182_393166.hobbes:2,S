That is an interesting concept because it could probably be used to satisfy
all parties. It seems that everyone has his own idea on what a container
should "feel" like, in term of pid virtualisation and container parent hood
also, at least. May be there is not a unique model.
Just booted 2.6.15-openvz.025stab014, I'm going to have a look at the
concepts you put place.
