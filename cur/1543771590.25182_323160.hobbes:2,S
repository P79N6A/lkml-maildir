OK, here's some more info (now visible on an 80x60 FB console):
1) I can see a couple of messages
	PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #10:2000000@80000000 for 0000:06:09.1
	...
followed by
	PCI: Bus 7, cardbus bridge: 0000:06:09.0
  	IO window: 00005000-00005fff
  	IO window: 00006000-00006fff
  	PREFETCH window: 80000000-81ffffff
  	MEM window: 80000000-81ffffff
, repeated for busses 11 and 15 of the cardbus bridge. This is the
notebook-internal cardbus bridge (see lspci in previous mail).
2) The last messages right before the oops are
  PCI: Bridge 0000:00:1e.0
    IO window 1000-6fff
    MEM window: 01000000-0dffffff
  This is the Southbridge to the notebook-internal PCI bus 0000:06
3) The oops itself occurs when attempting to setup the PREFETCH window of
that bridge and begins
  
  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
Specifically, it is located at the call of
    pcibios_resource_to_bus(bridge, &region, bus->resource[2]);
in drivers/pci/setup-bus.c, line 202.  I confirmed that
bus->resource[2] is indeed NULL at that time.
Interestingly, the PCI Express-to-PCI bus in the docking station
appears _not_ to be involved in this crash.
As usual, please let me know what additional info would be useful.
