Would it?  I think that code would still be needed, although possibly in
a different function.
There are two minor drawbacks to using the page cache, btw:
- Indirect blocks need some mapping too.  So either I need to steal a
  bit from the inode space or from the fpos space.
- OOM handling is a bit more complicated.  I would need a mempool for
  that.

Compressing random data will actually enlarge it.  If that happens I
simply store the verbatim uncompressed data instead and mark it as such.
There is also demand for a user-controlled bit in the inode to disable
compression completely.  All those .jpg, .mpg, .mp3, etc. just waste
time by trying and failing to compress them.
