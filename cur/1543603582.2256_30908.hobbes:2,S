Except that this enhancement is not completely safe, as if you get more
than 1024 children reaped (assuming you send two bytes of pid and two
bytes of status) between checks of the pipe, you'll lose notifications.
Admittedly this should be a problem in the sshd case, but it's not a
perfect solution in general. 
At least if you're only using the pipe to stop select() from blocking,
you don't care about overflowing the pipe as there's no important
information in there anyway.
