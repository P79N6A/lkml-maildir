I'm still in limbo on this patchset and could use some guidance. It's not
clear to me that IDR is really a big enough win over just hashing the inodes.
It seems like the inode hash is pretty well optimized for fast lookups such
that even if we get some extra hash collisions it shouldn't be too awful.
Perhaps the best thing to do is to start with a patch that just hashes the
inodes and then fall back to using IDR (or some other scheme) if it turns out
that it impacts performance too much?
Anyone have an opinion on what approach they think would be best here?
