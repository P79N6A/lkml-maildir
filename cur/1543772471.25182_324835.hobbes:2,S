Why would you want to encourage oddball approaches to driver
development? 
If a driver is causing problems this way, it should be looked at from a
design perspective, because that sort of coding style usually causes
problems with SMP as well.

It clarifies design aspects of the kernel, and identifies code that has
different behavior assumptions associated with it, than other code that
disables IRQs.  Its a good thing to separate that out, because then you
know what you are looking at, rather than having to assume it.
