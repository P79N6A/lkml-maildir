Forget the TEXT in the command description, cause what you are looking for
is not there.  It is stated and expressed in the state-diagrams, only.
There is minimal text, and only timing profiles for the device
manufacturers.  How to make it go is in the pictures and the text is only
supporting information.
That is why it is so painful to decode, and why it does not fit into the
requirements of early return of ever 4k or page of data back to the upper
layers.  So if we can not do the entire transfer w/ contigious memory we
are forced into this game of jump through the hoops.
