If you do not want wakeups (=> do not want any input from that
device), then close that device.

I kind-of understand "when you blank", but I do not think this
mandatory. Why would you want to suspend when switching to text
console? Am I no longer allowed to use gpm?

Yep, that would be nice; but not at price of /sys/.../power/state like
monstrosity that never ever worked properly.
