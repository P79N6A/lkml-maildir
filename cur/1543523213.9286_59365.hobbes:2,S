2.4.0 will be released when it is ready. If somebody mails a
critical bug report to Linus two hours before 2.4.0 would be
released, you can bet that it'll be released later.

Not unless you can see into the future. Oh, if you see the
date, would you care to tell us? I'm sure Linus would love
to know...
