Maybe not, because I got a similar oops twice from 2.2.9ac1 (SMP) for
the first time today.  It killed the machine dead, and so I had no
time for sorting out a ksymoops from a manual cut'n'paste; however, I
did capture the info on the office webcam :-)

in case anyone cares.
2.2.9ac5 non-SMP seems more stable, despite mysterious compilation
errors in PCMCIA 3.0.12 resulting from
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/page.h not #defining PAGE_OFFSET_RAW.
