I'm thinking of the following situation, immediately after we begin to
wait for fuse requests to subside:
  - task A is performing file operation O1
  - O1 is being served by task B
  - task B needs to perform O2 before finishing O1
Since we don't allow new requests, O2 will never start.  So O1 will
never finish.  So the number of fuse requests will never go to 0.

There are no busy fused's.  If we allowed O2 to go through, everything
would be nice and dandy.  But we cannot know that O2 needs to be let
through, and other fuse requests must not.

SIGKILL won't work on a stopped task.  Neither on a traced task.
Neither on a zombie (how many newbies are thoroughly confused about
that ;)
And it won't work on a task that is hanging on an NFS mount, when the
network broke.
Oh, and it won't work on a deadlocked fuse filesystem.  How many of
these have you met?  How many of the others?
