What thoughts, if any, have been given to post-patch code arrangement, 
besides eliminating prototypes?
This always struck me as a counterproductive exercise when taken by 
itself.  Sure, prototypes were eliminated, but was code packed together 
in an efficient way afterwards?  Ideally hot path code should be close 
together, ditto for various other things like error handling code.
Without further explanation or details about your post-patch analysis, 
how do we even know the new code arrangement doesn't negatively impact 
i-cache overall?
