No. It's a matter of abstraction. If you can _abstract_ the thing away, 
that's fine. I don't want more #ifdef's in source code, but you can have a 
totally different file that doesnt' do the things that aren't appropriate 
for non-MMU.
Yes, we've already got #ifdef's in code, but the point is that we don't 
add them unless there is serious _need_. And even then it's a sign of 
trouble. In this case, the sign of trouble is bigger than the need. 
uClinux might as well have a dummy "struct vm_operations", if only to make 
the damn thing look more like real Linux.
