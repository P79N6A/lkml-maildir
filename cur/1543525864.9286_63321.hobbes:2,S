Correct... 512 ought to be enough for a very long time.

This isn't a problem caused by the number of capabilities.
Simply having to look up what capabilities do and think about
the issue is what makes development difficult. Once you have
more than one, you might as well have 1000.
If anything, the association of multiple abilities with a single
bit makes the system more difficult to comprehend. Going with one
ability per bit also eliminates the VERY hairy problem of splitting
capability bits.

You contradict yourself, perhaps because you do not want to deal
with the problem of allocating bits for userspace. If it is good
to separate UID from policy, then user-space code must be able to
do so.

Ugh. It is not "edit /etc/password" (a specific file) but
"modify the user database" that is needed.
If the user database admin programs rely on UID, then we have not
left the UID-based system. THIS IS TOTALLY BROKEN. We might as well
just throw out all this complexity, since it isn't doing the job
it was intended to do -- it was supposed to end our use of UID as
a way to determine special ability.
UIDs and capability bits do not inherit in a compatible way.
It is insane to have two security systems that operate in
conflicting ways. I may want to use capability bits for security,
but how do I assign a bit for "database admin"? Without such
a bit, I am forced to use a per-UID system that does not have
compatible inheritance.
Really, it is better to reassign bits NOW than to do it later.
