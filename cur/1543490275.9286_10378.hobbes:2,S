Hi all,
My Linux system is working great, but I noticed kernel 2.2 complains about
my IDE chipset not being 100% native and disables DMA.  I have a Biostar
board with an ALi 15xx chipset.  The ALi 14xx driver in the kernel didn't
work (yes, I used the ide0=ali14xx kernel parameter).
Is there a place we can find a 15xx-supportive driver?  If not, then well,
I can live with the compatibility-mode.
