Hello:
I just got working an ASUS Dual Pentium Motherboard with a dual channel 
SCSI controller managed
by this driver.
Additional information required:
a) kind of SCSI interfce used: SCSI-II, SCSI-III (LVD) ?
b) Make sure you do not have hardware troubles like having a 80MBs drive 
on the same
channel as a 40 Mbs.
c) sym53c896 driver version ? When using SCSI-III LVD with 80MBs or 
higher I recommend to use 1.6b
Wait for that information
Cpaciba
