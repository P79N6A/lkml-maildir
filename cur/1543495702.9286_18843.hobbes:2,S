This might not be quite right, for two reasons.  Firstly, it would not be
hard to arrange for non-US users of Linux to get their IP encryption from a
non-US site.  (Provided it was developed outside the US, it could be legally
imported to the US)
Secondly, the Evil Empire is planning to ship IPsec in Windows 2000.  Unless
they provide a source-code level plug-in which can be shown to have been
developed outside the US, they will have to do some lobbying to get the law
changed, and that would benefit everybody (for once).
