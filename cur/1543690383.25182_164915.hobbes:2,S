# kbuild: Build minimum in scripts/ when changing configuration
# 
# From: Ricky Beam <jfbeam@bluetronic.net>, me
#

# of which is dependent on the kernel configuration, it makes sense to
# avoid building these too often.
# With this patch only fixdep is build, the minimal requirement for running
# any *config target
