You rock!  irqpoll works like a charm.  I get the same error in the
same place, but now all of my devices still work.  I don't see any
obvious performance impact (although I haven't tested it much).
I applied this irqpoll patch:
  
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2BunT-6Be-15
%40gated-at.bofh.it
and then some minor fixes (see below).
The log for this boot are at

in case anyone is interested.
