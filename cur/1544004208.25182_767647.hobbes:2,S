Can we abuse __builtin_constant_p somehow?  Maybe we can make a definition
something like:
#define __align_mask(x,mask) (
	__builtin_constant_p(mask) ? {
		(((x)+(mask))&~(mask)) :
		{              \
		      typeof(mask) __mask = mask;             \
		       (((x) + __mask) & ~__mask);             \
		}
	})
If it's a compile-time constant, it's safe to evaluate mask twice.
And if it's *not* a constant, it shouldn't be used for sizing arrays
in open code.  And if it's an array local to a procedure, it probably
should be kmalloc()'ed instead.
