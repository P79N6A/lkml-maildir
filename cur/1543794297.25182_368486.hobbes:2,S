Here's the output of lspci:
0003:01:03.0 Memory controller: Adaptec (formerly DPT) Domino RAID Engine 
(rev 02)
         Subsystem: Adaptec (formerly DPT) Domino RAID Engine

         Expansion ROM at 0000000080000000 [disabled] [size=32K]
As it looks it's equal to the "Intel" based cards...
Don't think it will work then, right?
