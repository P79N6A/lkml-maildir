   why would you think it's debian specific issue?
   btw if I add sleep at the beginning of /etc/init.d/checkfs.sh (runs 
fsck for all filesystems) everythings works. Which I guess confirms that 
there is some delay between when the module is loaded and when the 
device is available in userspace. Is that how udev works? How can this 
issue be solved?
   kernel 2.6.5, udev 0.024, debian unstable
