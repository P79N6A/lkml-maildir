What's the largest number of cpus that are supported right now? 256?
First call sysctl or whatever. If it fails, then glibc can assume 256. 
If someone installs an old kernel on a new computer then it's his own 
fault. The API is broken, we should fix it now - it will only get more 
painful in the future.
