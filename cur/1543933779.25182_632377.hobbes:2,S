If you think you're running on a chipset that *should* support thermal
monitoring, and it isn't there in a usable state, that seems pretty critical
to me.  If that didn't work, you probably can't trust the "oh, the chip will
thermal-limit itself if it gets to 100C or whatever" either.
Of course, I'm just speaking as somebody who quite recently had a system do a
thermal throttle when it hit 85C due to a cooling system failure.  I'm pretty
sure that if thermal monitoring wasn't functional, it wouldn't have throttled
either (after all, how can you throttle when you hit a given temp when you
don't have a working way to tell what the temp even is?), and I'd be looking at
extensive hardware damage...
