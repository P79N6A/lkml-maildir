I had a quick look through codesearch, too.  Another solution may be to
allow VT_SETMODE but deny VT_RELDISP if CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG is not
present. This way graphics tools still get notified when the console is
switched but can't prevent it.
It probably isn't worth the hassle.  I was just looking though the
kernel source to find out which ioctl would be better for my own console
locking tool to use.  I'm happy that it doesn't have to be setuid-root
but at the same time it nags me a little that denying service (and
potentially making users lose data because they cannot save) is so easy.
 And there is no way to switch it off.  Other than carrying the patch
myself, that is.
Regarding your earlier remark of VT_LOCKSWITCH potentially affecting the
session of the next user:  this is also possible with VT_PROCESS by
starting the locking process in the background.
