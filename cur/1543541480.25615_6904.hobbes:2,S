Oops, right.

What about turning your rom into romdisk, and then putting filesystem
just after kernel?
Or better, use cramfs. It will not be XIP, but it will solve your
tiny-memory problems: page to be needed will be uncompressed then
used. Yes, cramfs is probably the way to go; put it just after kernel
in rom, then mount rom as block device, and mount cramfs from it.
