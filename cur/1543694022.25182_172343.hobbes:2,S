It's quite simple: given a program than echoes a list of lines like
EVENT:xxxxx:something:somethingelse:somethingelsemore
with xxxxx a number (you can think this as a random number between 00000
and 05000)
I wrote a bash shell script that contains something like
./myprogram | grep ^EVENT | while read; do
	echo "$REPLY" >> "clientdata-${REPLY:6:5}"
done
That's all.
It continues up to ~6GB and 5000 different files then starts reading
the files back and so on. The problem *should* happen in the writing
phase.

Ok. I'll also ask him if he has a copy somewhere else, I think he sends
syslog messages to a remote machine too.
