Subject: 2.0.3x: select returns dubious tv.tv_sec?

I had a problem with zsh, whose command line started working strangely
after 248 days of uptime (jiffies > 2**31).
The problem turned out to be a select call that had invalid timeout value.
The tv struct in zsh was first initialized to zero. Then select was called
multiple times reinitializing the tv_usec part to zero before each call.
tv_sec should have remained zero after select() as far as I can tell (and
most like did before the 248 day barrier). From the man page:
       "On  Linux,  timeout  is  modified to reflect the amount of
       time not slept; most other implementations do not do this."
So tv.tv_sec only get decremented during select().
The example program from the select man page with one additional printf:
vherva@turing:/home/vherva>cat u.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int
main(void)
{
           fd_set rfds;
           struct timeval tv;
           int retval;
           /* Watch stdin (fd 0) to see when it has input. */
           FD_ZERO(&rfds);
           FD_SET(0, &rfds);
           /* Wait up to five seconds. */
           tv.tv_sec = 5;
           tv.tv_usec = 0;
           retval = select(1, &rfds, NULL, NULL, &tv);
           /* Don't rely on the value of tv now! */
           printf("... because if one does, he'll get suprised: %i.\n",
                  tv.tv_sec);
           if (retval)
               printf("Data is available now.\n");
               /* FD_ISSET(0, &rfds) will be true. */
           else
               printf("No data within five seconds.\n");
           exit(0);
}
vherva@turing:/home/vherva>gcc u.c -o u;./u
q
... because if one does, he'll get suprised: 4.
Data is available now.
vherva@turing:/home/vherva>cd
vherva@turing:/home/vherva>gcc u.c -o u;./u
... because if one does, he'll get suprised: 13124461.
No data within five seconds.
vherva@turing:/home/vherva>uptime
 12:49am  up 345 days,  4:48,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
The problem is somewhere in the fs/select.c, I suspect.
        if ((long) timeout < 0)
                timeout = 0;
        if (tvp && !(current->personality & STICKY_TIMEOUTS)) {
                put_user(timeout/HZ, &tvp->tv_sec);
                timeout %= HZ;
                timeout *= (1000000/HZ);
                put_user(timeout, &tvp->tv_usec);
        }
It seems clear that timeout (unsigned) is somewhere between 2**31 and 2**32
when those erranous values are returned. It is not clear to me how 
timeout gets those values.
