Kernel arch/.../board-X.c code is the place to "reliably" handle
that.  Bootloader is out-of-scope here; it's a separate codebase.

Moved it out of runtime, to a small window before "init" sections
get discarded and "init" is invoked.  So if it ever *could* show
up, it'll show up then ... every time the system boots, a message
will appear.  Easy to notice while the bug is fresh, just from a
developer's routine scan of bootup messages.
The alternative lets the problem appear later, almost randomly,
based on whether the conflicting drivers happen to be loaded
at the same time.  Which *IS* harder to debug.
I still remember the time a board had to be respun because the
hardware guys goofed on use of one signal.  Two different drivers
both needed it ... but until later in system integration, they
were never tested together, so that conflict never showed up.
(It was a non-obvious thing, for on-chip signal routing not the
on-board type verified by module tests in hardware QA and design
review.)
Doing that setup "early" would have prevented that problem, and
avoided one annoying schedule slip and hardware respin.

I don't know why you're reading what I write as any kind of
preference for doing that in the bootloader.  It's nothing
more than an *acknowledgement* that some vendors work that
way, so Linux is better off with an approach which won't be
broken when they do.  (That is, always having finished pin
mux setup before drivers get probed.)
When Linux does that setup in arch/..../board-X.c files, mostly
before drivers come into play, it's normal for driver code to
ignore it ... which means the bootloader might also have done
it, for those kinds of product.
Usually I'd expect one person on the bootloader, plus ideally
understudies.  Not a full time job; that person might mostly
do kernel development, hardware test/bringup, or something
else depending on how the product team was structured.

Good!!  If it's not in drivers, I suspect you'll agree that it
will probably all land in that arch/..../board-X.c setup code.

... IMO less good, but that's all your worry.  I suspect that
by the time you handle a few dozen boards, you'll find Kconfig
is not well suited to this.  (Because of the way it prevents one
kernel from handling multiple boards, unless they really aren't
very different.)

These are people already familiar with ARM or PPC embedded Linux?
I guess one question is "easier than what".
Kconfig doesn't try to help with the "give me a minimal .config
for <THIS> hardware" problem; say, by reading "lspci -n" output
or some other system description.  It expects people to know their
way around.  Maybe a bit of a "20 questions" style interface
comes across as providing useful hand-holding; some of that can
be done in Kconfig, but it's still a kind of menu maze.
I'd hope people don't still get degrees for writing automagic
system configuration tools.  Even though it's still not easy.  :)

We could have that discussion in a few years.  I suspect you'll
find less going into Kconfig and more into C code, if for no
other reason than to make sure things scale sanely.  Or if lots
of stuff is in Kconfig ... it'll be in the arch part of the tree
associated with boards, not the driver parts.
