Oh I know it's going to be tough, and there's going to be a lot of crap
to take care of, but in the end, I think it will be worth it...hopefully
if I'm still sane then...

Yeah, ALSA scares me, along with the input layer code.  I had dreams of
easily converting them to use proper refcounting, but now know there's
no way that would be an easy conversion and have pretty much given up on
it.  For 2.6 at least.  
That's why my "simple_class" patch will have to be a band-aid for now to
get sysfs representation for those types of devices.
