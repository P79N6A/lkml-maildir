Hi,
I will apply this into my tree, thanks.

The problem here is backwards compatibility - if we would like to do the 
change in a consistent way, we should rename all the places which (for 
historic reasons) mention powerbook only. Unfortunately this would also 
require renaming the module parameter hid_pb_fnmode, which might be a 
little too intrusive with respect to maintaining backward compatibility in 
userspace (ok, we have already been fiddling with this parameter anyway 
during the usbhid code split, but anyway).
If you would care to make the patch which maintains backwards 
compatibility (for example by aliasing the variable pb_fnmode behing two 
module parameters), that might probably be ok.
Thanks,
