Hello,
	I know that this is a newbies question, but I didn't get any
answer in the newbies list, so I am posting it here. 
	In 2.2.14, I have implemented a set of system calls(This is just
academic). The numbers are from 191 - 196. (The virgin source tree has
up to 190 in entry.S). I have given a printk in the system call proper in
the last one(196),(and at many other places in the call chain from there).
(Is it fair to use those syacall numbers ?)
	But when I boot up that kernel that printk gets executed. While 
booting, at least to my knowledge, that part of the code is not supposed
to get executed. Also while the kernel goes down, that printk speaks
again. 
	All other system calls are working fine.
	I am getting some oops and panic while that syscall executes, so I
am suspicious that I am doing something that I should never have done.
	Do anybody has any idea what might be going wrong?
Sorry to you all for disturbing,
