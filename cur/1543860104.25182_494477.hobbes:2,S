just to expand on this: i dont think this should be an impediment to the 
POSIX AIO patches. We should get some movement into this and should give 
the capability to glibc and applications. Kernel-internal unification is 
something we are pretty good at doing after the fact. (and if any of the 
APIs dies or gets very uncommon we know in which direction to unify)
