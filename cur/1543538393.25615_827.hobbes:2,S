Perhaps I'm naive, but it doesn't seem all that hard in the average
case.  If the kernel had access to some sort of historical
memory-usage data then it could do some simple analysis in OOM.  I
imagine it would be pretty easy to spot your run-of-the-mill infinite-loop
allocator with a few seconds of data at hand.
If this idea is to be persued there are two questions - where/how to
gather the necessary historical traces and what analysis to perform to
come up with the culprit most of the time.
Good idea?  Suitable for a first kernel project?
