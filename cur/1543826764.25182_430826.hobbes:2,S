I don't know how long it takes to review such a large patch, but
I'll continue to do so.  For now:
README:
1. +Documentation for /proc/sys/, aka. sysctl
a.k.a. or just "aka".  Not "aka.".  or spell it out, or omit it,
maybe like:
Documentation for /proc/sys/ (sysctl)
2.  Limit lines to max. of 80 characters, but around 70-72 is better
IMO.  That allows someone to make minor corrections without having
to fudge the lines around.
3.  +This means there're several parameters
use "there are"
4.  +are: enabling or disabling forwading in a certain network interface
forwarding
5.  +is also used to export some stadistic information, ej: some
statistic or statistics or statistical
ej: ??  use e.g.: (preferred) or eg:
6.  +can be read but can _not_ be written.
_cannot_
7.  +own program to read them aswell)
as well)
8.  +to change '/' by '.' and ignore the '/proc/sys' part of the path, ie
s/by/to/
s/ie/i.e./
9.  +means that any tweak that you do will be lost the next time you restart  your
* collapse 2 spaces to 1
10. +_VERY_ DANGEROUS and can ruin the performance performance,
drop one "performance"
11. +As a quick 'ls /proc/sys' will show, the directory consists of several subdirs.
+Each subdir is mainly about one part of the kernel, so you can do configuration
Spell out "subdirectories" and "subdirectory".
12. +fs/		specific filesystems filehandle, inode, dentry and quota tuning
insert ":" after "filesystems"
OK, that's all for the README file.  I'll look at the rest of it
sometime this week.  I don't think that it's quite ready to be merged.
