> I think the cleanup
I'm sure you read of this comment in page_alloc.c:
* Buddy system. Hairy. You really aren't expected to understand this
*
* Hint: -mask = 1+~mask
and the slab allocator must sustain more 10 times more allocations/sec:
from lse netbench on sourceforge, 4-cpu, ext2, one minute:
    4 million kmallocs,
    5 million kmem_cache_alloc
    721 000 rmqueue
slab.c doesn't need to be simple, it must be fast.

Ok, so you agree that your changes are only beneficial in one case:
kmem_cache_free(), uniprocessor or SMP not-per-cpu cached.
* frees one object
* after that free-operation no further slabs with allocated objects are
left - only full and free slabs.
Your code ensures that the next object returned will be the previously
freed object, my code doesn't guarantee that.
If I can modify my slab allocator to guarantee it, you'd drop your
patch?
