Q:
How come 2.2.10 uses a somehow arbitrary ip number out of the aliases
pool instead of the primary one as source address when opening a
connection to the world?
Ex: 70 virt interfaces up with IPs in 7 subnets /24.
    ping et al use source ip from one of these interfaces
    down the 70 again, and it works.
    down the one with the IP, then ping uses another from the alias
    pool.
this behaviour is most irritating, since it renders ip aliasing
useless.
Hint?
