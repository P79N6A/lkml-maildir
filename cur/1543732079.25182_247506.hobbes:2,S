Grr. I should have checked before I built with this patch. With this in
I now get the
  kernel: Could not allocate 4 bytes percpu data
messages again. Need to increase that data area so
  #define PERCPU_ENOUGH_ROOM 196608
or something similar (should leave about 50K free for modules).
I will rebuild with this change plus the latest of the others.
