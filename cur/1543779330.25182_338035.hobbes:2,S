This was the idea with the drivers/soc suggestion although I think that
name is perhaps misleading.
How about drivers/mfd where mfd = Multi Functional Devices?
I think it would be acceptable (and in keeping with the other drivers
e.g. pcmcia) to seeing the arch and platform specific modules with the
main driver as long as the naming reflected it (like the existing mcp
and ucb code does) i.e.:
mcp-core.c
mcp-sa1100.c
ucb1x00-code.c
ucb1x00-assabet.c
ucb1x00-collie.c
If code can be separated out into subsystems, I'm not so sure where they
should go though. The existing policy would suggest
drivers/input/touchscreen and sound/xxx for these...
ucb1x00-ts.c
ucb1x00-audio.c
