We just said screw it and will be getting an oc48 sonet connection.
Its helps knowing the top guys at a major us telcom and also having
its fiber running only 30 feet away from our building :-) . I will be
designing this load balancing solution on my off time and recording my
outcomes of various configurations as I wouldn't mind seeing if this
can work like I want it to.If anyones interested in the
outcomes...email me
Anyways, thanks to everyone though for helping out in the past.
Sincerely,
Brent Clements
