I have another backup running right now, after building a plain 
2.6.21-rc3, and rebooting just now for the test.  I don't think its the 
scheduler itself, but is something post 2.6.20 that is messing with tars 
mind and making it think the files it just read to do the estimate phase, 
are all new, so even a level 2 is in effect a level 0.  I'll have an 
answer in about an hour, but its also 2:36am here and I'm headed for the 
rack to get some zzz's.  So I'll report in the morning as to whether or 
not this backup ran as it was supposed to.  I have a feeling its not 
going to though.
