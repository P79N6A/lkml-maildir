I also have this problem....
I had it with 2.6.0 and now I have this reboot with 2.6.1 also. I have a 
Pentium 4 CPU and this reboot occurs if I compile my kernel with this 
specific type of CPU only after "Uncompressing kernel..." message 
appears. If I compile it with Pentium3 support, it loads properly 
without reboot.
If I need to post any other information vabout my system, I'm happy to 
help you in solving my problem.
Please CC me, I'm off the list.
regard,
Zsolt
