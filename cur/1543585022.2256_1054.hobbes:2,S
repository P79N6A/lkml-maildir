You're not supposed to do anything, that's just a general rule of thumb.
If your system hardly ever swaps, use a swapfile, because speed doesn't
matter a lot anyway.

No, don't do that. Physical memory is better than swap. Swap is a backup
for physical memory, so that you can run programs that use more memory
than you have. You don't really *need* swap, linux works fine without.
