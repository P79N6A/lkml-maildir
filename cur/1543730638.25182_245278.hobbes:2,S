It's its, not it's, unless of course you mean it is, in which case it's
it's not its.
More helpfully, "its" is a pronoun like "his" or "hers".  "it's" is an
abbreviation for "it is".
Also, this is a mistake:
+/**

+ * @dev: pointer to pci device struct
+ *
+ */
+void 
+pci_cleanup_rom(struct pci_dev *pdev) 
I'd like a little bit of description about the difference between
pci_cleanup_rom and pci_remove_rom in the docbook, please.
