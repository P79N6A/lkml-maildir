I don't have a thinkpad, but I tried it - just for fun - with my desktop
PC here.  And it also shows some.. strangeness.  Namely, after several
secounds, it starts spewing:
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: control queue full
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: control queue full
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: control queue full
messages on the screen on every setleds (above) invocation.  Even if I
stop the loop and execute single setleds manually, it also shows this
same message.  And the led isn't working anymore too - even if I press
NumLock key, NumLock mode activates/deactivates correctly, but not the
led -- ditto for other leds (CapsLock & ScrollLock).  And it doesn't
restore when I switch to X and back.
(My keyboard is USB-connected).
I think it's something about count of setleds/etc operations.  Rebooting
and counting from 0...
