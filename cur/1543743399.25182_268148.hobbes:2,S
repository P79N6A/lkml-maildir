Subject: [PATCH][V4L] keep tvaudio driver away from saa7146
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi all,
the attached patch keeps the tvaudio i2c helper module away from any 
saa7146 based framegrabber. All saa7146 drivers have their dedicated i2c 
helper modules and don't work together with tvaudio, so keep it away 
alltogether. This will make mixed-card configurations work.
The patch was discussed and ack'ed by Gerd Knorr.
Please apply.
Thanks
Michael.
