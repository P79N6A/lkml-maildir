I'm now testing this small patch based on your suggestion b). I have
netfilter running, nfs mounts are behaving well, and fragmented pings dont
kill the box. I made no attempt to resolve anything but the derefernce of a
netdevice *dev.= NULL
The patch only deals with the ip_defrag_queue path. I have not seen the
alternate one happen. It's only been up an hour, I'll put some more time on
it.
Cheers,
Tom
