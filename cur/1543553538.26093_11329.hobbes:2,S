Wow, that's a lousy BIOS.  You mean it actually *can't tell* if there's
a CPU in the second socket or not?
I remember a couple years ago Linus remarked that *every time* Linux
tried to rely on a BIOS feature, there'd be at least one bug report
traceable to a buggy BIOS somewhere.  Proven once again.... (:
