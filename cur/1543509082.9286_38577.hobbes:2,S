Thanks!
The Linux keyboard code is fairly general already,
and almost always one can make it do whatever is desired.
Right now I know about two problems:
- It cannot accommodate keyboards with more than 128 (in fact 127) keys.
- The i386 part assigns a special role to e0 and e1.
(This apart from minor flaws in the present code that are easily fixed.)
Is anyone aware of other kbd problems (not of hardware nature)?
