Not necessarily.  Increasing swap can allow more physical RAM to be used for
caching data from disk.
Imagine a system with limited physical RAM, and limited swap space, running a
process which causes a lot of filesystem activity on the same physical disk
as is being used for swap.  If the total RAM, both physical and swap is almost
completely full, increasing the swap space may allow some data from physical
RAM to be swapped out, in favour of caching filesystem data from the disk.
Without knowing more details of the original poster's machine, it's difficult
to give specific advice about how to solve the problem.
John.
