Hi Shailabh,
When this is read through connectors, it's initiated by the connectors
code which is called from the task's context hence we don't need
locking for that. It's very similar to the task_notify code I am about
to post and I think the connector code could fit into that
framework. The main issue is /proc, but then one could even have a
mechanism with a hook when the task exits that pushes the data to a
storage point which is lock protected.
Even if a lock isn't contended, you are still going to see the cache
lines bounce around due to the writes. It may not show up on a 4-way
box but what happens on a 64-way? We have seen some pretty nasty
effects on the bigger SN2 boxes with locks that were taken far too
frequently, to the point where it would prevent the box from booting
(now I don't expect it to that severe here, but I'd still like to
explore an approach of doing it lock free).

Ok, finally, sorry for the delay. My current code snapshot is
available at 
http://www.trained-monkey.org/~jes/patches/task_notify/
 -
it's a modified version of Jack's task_notify code, and three example
users of it (the SysV IPC semundo semaphore, the key infrastructure
and SGI's JOB module). The patch order should be task_notify.diff,
task-notify-keys.diff, task-notify-semundo.diff, and
task_notify-job.diff last.
I think task_notify it should be usable for statistics gathering as
well, the only issue is how to attach it to the processes we wish to
gather accounting for. Personally I am not a big fan of the current
concept where statistics are gathered for all tasks at all time but
just not exported until accounting is enabled.
I just had a quick look at the connector code and I think it could
possibly be hooked into the task_notify code as well as connectors
seem to be another optional feature.
The API for the task_notify code is not set in stone and we can add
more notifier hooks where needed. If someone has strong reasoning for
making changes to the API, then I'll be very open to that.
Anyway, let me know what you think?
Cheers,
Jes
