Same here. I set up a NFS-server for test and let the Sun
mount the data in a temporary directory to verify the situation.
The test-server may crash, but the sun will survive. After you
stopped the test on the sun, you might have to reboot your
test-server to be able to unmount the disk on the sun again.

Yes, all 2.6.x seem to be affected. My good old 2.4.19 runs since 6 month.
I started to scan the 2.5.x patches for changes on nfsd, to find by which
one this kind of trouble was caused....
