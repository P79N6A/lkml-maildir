It's not whether or not your particular code does it.  It's whether or not it
can happen in the framework within which you are using the FPU regs.  No, with
just copy/clear page using these things it won't happen.  But if you add an
SSE zero page function, who's to say that we shouldn't add a memset routine,
or a copy_*_user routines, or copy_csum* routines that also use the SSE regs? 
And once you add those various routines, are they all going to be safe with
respect to each other (the tricky one's here are if you add the copy_*_user
stuff since they can pagefault in the middle of the operation)?  Plus, if you
have both SSE and MMX and maybe even 3DNow operations, are you going to pick
the fastest of each on each processor that supports each type, meaning you may
use one SSE and one MMX routine on the same processor if the MMX routine just
happens to beat out the SSE routine for a particular task?  Once you take all
these things into consideration, the question becomes what limit are you going
to place on kernel SSE register usage?  Because if you don't severly limit its
usage, then you have to handle all the odd scenarios above, and that's where
it gets very difficult to get it right.  So, that's the policy decision that
needs to be made (and Linus typically has made it very difficult to get this
stuff accepted into the kernel, which is an implicit statement of that policy)
before a person can decide if your patch is sufficient, or if it needs
additional protection from other possible SSE/MMX using routines.
