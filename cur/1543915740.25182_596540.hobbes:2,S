Thank you for merging them into linux-2.6.23-rc6-mm1.
Additionally, could you merge the following patches to clean up
add-vmcoreinfo.patch ?
[PATCH 5/4] [-mm patch] Rename macros returning the size.
 The #define SIZE() should be renamed STRUCT_SIZE() since it's always 
 returning the size of the struct with a given name.  This would allow 
 TYPEDEF_SIZE() to simply become SIZE() since it need not be used 
 exclusively for typedefs. This idea is David Rientjes's.

[PATCH 6/4] [-mm patch] use the existing offsetof().
 It is better that offsetof() is used for VMCOREINFO_OFFSET().
 This idea is Joe Perches's.
Thanks
