I had the same problem, and I solved it, but I'm afraid my solution
probably won't help. I cleaned the blocked ventilation paths in my
laptop and haven't experienced the problem since. I think it was
overheating under load, even with SpeedStep.
I'm not sure why too much heat would cause this problem when it never
caused other weird behavior. Maybe some speed throttling or other
unusual activity was preventing IRQ's from being handled correctly.
