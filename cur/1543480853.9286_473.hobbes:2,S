Dual Celeron 300 (cacheless processors)
It works great on 2.1.131 but locks solid on 2.2.0pre8. It goes to check the
APIC timing.... finds the processors at 300MHz'ish and then the APIC at
66MHz'ish and locks with a line of video garbage at the top of the screen.
There are no logs at this point and no ooops... I don't think the
framebuffer code is executing yet... any things to look at?
