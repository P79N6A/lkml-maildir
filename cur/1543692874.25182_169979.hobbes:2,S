That's all completely up to whoever decides to use this combination of
CLONE_* flags.  It might mean that SIGIO cannot be used and that fuser
cannot be used.  But so what?  That might be acceptable in that
situation.  What isn't acceptable is providing wrong information to the
program.  And this is not using a pointer to the kernel thread does.
Of course it could be redefined as "point to the process group leader"
but I'm not sure whether this and introducing "/proc/task" or so is
worth the trouble.
