With my subsystem that would look like:
static const struct spi_cs_table
platform_spi1_cs_table[] = {
 {
  .name  = "touchscreen",
  .cs_no  = 1,
  .platform_data = NULL,
  .flags  = SPI_CS_IDLE_HIGH,
  .cs_data = 0,
 },
 {
  .name  = "flash",
  .cs_no  = 3,
  .platform_data = NULL,
  .flags  = SPI_CS_IDLE_HIGH,
  .cs_data = 0,
 },
};
As far as I can see most SPI devices have fixed
wirering to an adapter as SPI is not really a hotplug
bus.
The subsystem does allow you to add extra devices that
aren't in the cs table if you want by calling
spi_device_register in which case you have to setup
the spi_device with the correct information.

The struct clk should have been removed, I missed it
on that tidy up.
Why not pass platform data through the platform_data
pointer? I have now provided an extra field now which
lets you pass in any other platform data.

I hope not, I spent a long time learning about the
features of the 2.6 driver model. I'm happy to trim
down any fat.

This is what my SPI core tries to do. I would like to
make at 'as small as possible and no smaller'
