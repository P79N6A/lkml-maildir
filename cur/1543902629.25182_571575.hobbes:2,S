Yes, this is a possibility, and one I had considered at first. But I
wasn't sure which subdirectory to check. sysfs isn't well known for its
stability, and I didn't know which directories exist since the
early days of sysfs, and which do not. For example, fs, kernel and
module were not present in 2.6.5. I am also not sure if directories
which exist today are guaranteed to exist forever. This is the reason
why I decided to check the link count instead, basically checking that
at least one subdirectory exists, without having to name it.
