Hi,
Can anyone tell me why there's no data from /dev/random on linux-alpha?
The system is an UDB Multia, running stock redhat-6.0 (kernel 2.2.5). Also
tried 2.2.11, that doesn't give anything either.
I couldn't find anything alpha architecture specific in
drivers/char/random.c...

I'd explain it to you, but your brain would explode.
