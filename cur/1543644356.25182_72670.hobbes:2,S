i have, and i see stuff like this:
+       TRACE_PROCESS(TRACE_EV_PROCESS_WAKEUP, p->pid, p->state);
+static inline void TRACE_PROCESS(u8 ev_id, u32 data1, u32 data2)
+{
+       trace_process proc_event;
+
+       proc_event.event_sub_id = ev_id;
+       proc_event.event_data1 = data1;
+       proc_event.event_data2 = data2;
+
+       trace_event(TRACE_EV_PROCESS, &proc_event);
+}
where trace_event() is defined as:
+int trace_event(u8 pm_event_id,
+               void *pm_event_struct)
[...]
+       read_lock(&tracer_register_lock);
ie. it's using a global spinlock. (sure, it can be made lockless, as other
tracers have done it.)
