Because otherwise you far too easily end up in a situation where every
system suddenly need to be able to support *BOTH* endianisms, at which
point you're really screwed; supporting dual endianism is significantly
more expensive than supporting the "wrong" endianism, and it affects all
systems.
Nip this one in the bud.
