I found a regression when I applied drivers/net/skge.[ch] patches on top 
of 2.6.23.1 at stable tree (4367388f04eea72e78347dc9b299698bf4275f92). 
It hangs the network on high speed transfers.
This the same regression that happened for 2.6.24-rc*:

The driver in 2.6.23.1 works for me. Afaik, Stephen Hemminger is working 
on it.
