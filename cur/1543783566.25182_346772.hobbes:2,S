I had a similar problem (intermittant) and narrowed it down to mod loading of
uhci-hcd so I blacklisted the module and loaded it later in rc.local where it
didn't hang.
Recently I tried unblacklisting it to see if it still hung and it did
not so you might try 2.6.13 final.
To narrow it down, edit rc.sysinit (depending on distribution) and make the
modprobes into modprobe -v
