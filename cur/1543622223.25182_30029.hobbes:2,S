ClearCase inspired? ( tum, tee tum ... )
That's great if you have a fast network conection, eg, using the wink-in 
feature with
CC, sometimes with slow or overloaded network it take more time wink-in 
a object
then compile it from scrash. Winking in object-files over internet may 
not always be optimal.
In case wih Linux kernel, you must wink in a object from someone that 
have exaclty the
same kernel version and configuration, that may be a complex task to 
solve ...
