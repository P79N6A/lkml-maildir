To simplify: substitute "rsync" with "backup program".
Any backup software that maintains some type of index of what has been
backed up (for incremental type backups) or even just backs up files
modified since a particular date (e.g. "dump") can miss files modified
shortly before a crash/power cut/unexpected shutdown.  The data may get
modified but since the mtime may not get updated, nothing can tell that
the data has been modified.
rsync is actually a special case, in that you could always force it to
compare contents between two copies.  Most backup software doesn't do
that (especially tape backups).
