Kernel built with gcc 2.7.2.3. With pppd, X, and Netscape running, got an
oops. Unfortunately, very little made it into the syslog before the machine
rebooted.
perfect kernel: hdc: multwrite_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
perfect kernel: hdc: buffer list corrupted
perfect kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
address 0000000c
perfect kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 01c20000, %cr3 = 01c20000
perfect kernel: *pde = 00000000
perfect kernel: Oops: 0002
perfect kernel: CPU:    0
