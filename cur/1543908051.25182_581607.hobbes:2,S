The assumption that aligned word reads and writes are atomic, and that words are 
aligned unless explicitly packed otherwise, is endemic in the kernel.  No sane 
compiler violates this assumption.  It's true that we're not portable to insane 
compilers after this patch, but we never were in the first place.
