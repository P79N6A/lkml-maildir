The Codepage 949 Translation table can download from:
  
http://web.mit.edu/afs/dev.mit.edu/source/src-current/third/libiconv/tests/CP932.TXT
(CP932 is Japanese letters, Japanese Shift-JIS)
But it has much more different of tables in "
http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/932.htm"
the origin CP932 table of kernel nls_cp932.c, is close to the Microsoft's table in the web (still some different).
The big different is the area of Char To Unicode, the lead byte is :
  0xF0, 0xF1, 0xF2, 0xF3, 0xF4, 0xF5, 0xF6, 0xF7, 0xF8, 0xF9
In the Microsoft's table (
http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/932.htm
), they are EMPTY!
But in the Mit edu's CP932.TXT (
http://web.mit.edu/afs/dev.mit.edu/source/src-current/third/libiconv/tests/CP932.TXT
), they have corresponding letters. 
Which one is correct? Can someone tell me?  Thanks!
