Make it a configure option, forced by drivers that need them and up to the
builder otherwise (default to "yes", I'd suppose).
Going a bit further, there are several cases of "library" stuff in the
kernel (CRC, gzip come to mind). Dunno if it is enough stuff to set up a
specific policy and perhaps CML support (or suggestions on how to use CML2
for this case).
