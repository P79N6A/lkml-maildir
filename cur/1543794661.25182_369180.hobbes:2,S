Can someone tell me if 2.6.14-rt13 is supposed to be fixed re: the
problems I was having with random screensaver triggering and keyboard

It is apparently not fixed. 
I just had a short burst of key repeats and saw one random screen blank.
Right now everything seems normal but I was not allucinating :-)
