Why you think it should oopsed?  Even if find_next_zero_bit() finds a
zero bit beyond of the end of bitmap, the check next > maxblocks will
catch this and make sure we are not taking a zero bit out of the bitmap
range, so it fails as expected.

The loop should not go forever, it will stops when there is no window
with free bit to reserve in the given block group.

Yes, trucate_mutex protect both struct ext[234]_reserve_window and ext
[234]_reserve_window_node, and struct ext[234]_block_alloc_info.
Actually I think truncate_mutex protects all data structures related to
block allocation/mapping structures.
