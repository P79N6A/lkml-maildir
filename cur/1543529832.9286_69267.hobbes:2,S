oops, i missed that indeed, darn. Hm., there are not all that many such
places though, and the value itself is cached in current->processor anyway
(and 'current' can be cached across reschedules). I cannot see any easy
way to avoid this bug in any 'automatic' way though. How can we prevent
writing a 'semi-constant' to a local variable, possibly at compile-time?
The impact seems to be moderate i believe: out of 1150 driver-modules only
5 use smp_processor_id() directly. I've checked all these places and none
of them is unsafe (smp_processor_id() is never saved to the stack). I've
also checked the networking code which uses smp_processor_id() in some
places, and only a small amount of code would break: netif_rx saves it to
a local variable and while it's mostly called from IRQ contexts, it can be
called from syscall level as well. Most other places use
smp_processor_id() under some spinlock. But yes, these would be subtle
bugs if unfixed.

hm, current->spinlock_depth should work pretty well i believe, no? That
one is SMP-safe as well. It doesnt have any global cacheline problems
either.
