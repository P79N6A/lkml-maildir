   See Paul's message.  ia64 does the same thing with hardware walked hashed 
   page tables.  Now, do you want to pay for the 2 days of time you want me 
   to commit to investigating something which is obvious to me?  I don't think 
   so.
Why would it take you two days to put together a test case for
something so "trivial"?  Don't be rediculious.
I would be more than happy to pay for the 2 days it's going to take
for you to possibly admit "yeah, maybe it doesn't matter in real life,
sorry". :-)
Franks a lot,
