ITR was in fact activated. I think i've disabled it now
(e1000.InterruptThrottleRate=0 in the kernel cmdline).
And as I'm reading the e1000 code, there is no way to enable/disable
NAPI without a recompile. So the fact that ethtool spat out -NAPI in
the version string means that NAPI is actually used.
