Face it, Nigel, this is a losing battle.  You can try to come up with
ever-more complex schemes to try and force FUSE into the freezer's
framework, but it just won't fit.  Or if it does, the next filesystem
to come along will require an even more baroque type of special-case 
handling.
The general problem is that task A may be in an unfreezable state,
waiting for task B to do something, while task B is already frozen.  
Since there's no reasonable way to determine that A really is waiting
for B, you're just stuck.  (To make matters worse, A may not even
realize which task it is waiting for; it may know only that it's
waiting for somebody to do something!)  A and B could be user tasks, 
kernel threads, or one of each.
The only thing to do is what Rafael has been working on: unfreeze
things, hope the tasks sort themselves out, and try again.
