OK, will see what I can do...

You lost me on this one...  The writer has only the following three steps:
writer:
	x.a = 1;
	smp_wmb();  /* or smp_mb() */
	global_p = &x;
Where did the "r1 = p" come from?  For that matter, where did "p" come
from?

Ah!  Please note that I am doing something unusual here in that I am
working with global variables, as opposed to the normal RCU practice of
dynamically allocating memory.  So "x" is just a global struct, not a
pointer to a struct.

Of course, fairness would require that it also scare you away from
value-speculation optimizations in compilers.  ;-)
