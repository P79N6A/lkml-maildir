Yes, it would.  Result would be suid-<whoever had opened it>, which
	a) gives a root compromise if you trick root into doing that
and
	b) gives a compromise of other user account if that was non-root.
Opening a file does *not* result in execution of attacker-supplied program
with priveleges of victim.  Breaking that warranty opens a fsck-knows-how-many
holes.
