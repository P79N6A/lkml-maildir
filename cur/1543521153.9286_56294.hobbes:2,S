It would be very easy. Please don't.

Without /proc/partitions it is almost impossible to find out
what disks exist, what partitions are recognized by the kernel,
and do "mount by volume label". That is the purpose of /proc/partitions.
On the other hand, finding p->sys_ind is completely trivial
(read the partition table and look up this field - you can steal
the code from any *fdisk version).
Moreover, many types of partition table do not have any p->sys_ind.
- indeed, this is something that applies to DOS-type partition tables only -
so in general it is not meaningful to provide such a field.
[Before people start contradicting - yes, many other types of
partition table also have some kind of a systemtype identifier,
but the values are different, so such an additional field in
/proc/partitions would not be meaningful without the additional
information in what kind of partition table the system type was found.]
