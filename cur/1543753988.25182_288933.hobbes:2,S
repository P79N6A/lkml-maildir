Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
this is the usual batch of DVB updates from linuxtv.org CVS.
The patches were prepared by Michael Hunold, I just rediffed
them to apply cleanly against 2.6.11-rc2, and submit
them on his behalf this time.
I realize it is actually a bit late in the 2.6.11 release
cycle but I hope they can be included in 2.6.11 anyway, as
they don't touch anything outside the DVB subsystem.
If not I will factor out the important bug fixes and
resubmit them.
