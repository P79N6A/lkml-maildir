Thanks for dealing with my acidness in the first patch :)
But what about this one?

Making this amount changes and not thinking about more intelligent
coding of the functionality?

I mean, *write() have nothing to do with loglevels. If they do
(suddenly), then why not to use a char in the *str to make it possible? I
might be wrong, but there are already macros before format strings in
printk().
And this is not `loglevel' thing any more. It's attributes, which can be
used by many other drivers/file systems/schedulers/ what ever, if
developers, like Ingo, will extend printk() output to be more nice in
subsystems they develop.
So, maybe they can be extended, and functionality implemented in the
function bodies (which will be `do { } while (0)' if config is NO), but
*NOT* by passing additional argument to the functions.
