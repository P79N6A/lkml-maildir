<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN class=150045505-30032000>I have an idea which 
some of you might not like, but would make linux heaps easier to use. Could the 
developers design a new system of device driver installation. The current method 
is much to hard for the average computer user. It would be much easier if you 
had a system whereby you download a binary executable for the device you wish to 
install on your PC. When you run it it would automatically install the driver, 
with no configuration necessary. It could ask for IRQ or IO, but you shouldn't 
have to go through config files to do this.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN class=150045505-30032000>I have a few ideas 
on how this stuff could be done, but I'm not an expert kernel hacker, so 
someone&nbsp;else would have to do it. </SPAN></FONT></DIV>
