It is *very* common problem for people to think that their root fs is ext3
when in fact it is being mounted as ext2.
It seems that /etc/mtab incorrectly reports ext3, which doesn't help.
The real truth is revealed in /proc/mounts.  (Which has this irritating
"/dev/root" thing in it, btw).
So anything we can do to simplify this problem for people would be
really good.  (It would be good if kernel.org came back, too, so we
can see the patch ;))
And Andreas' idea of "Warning: mounting ext3 as as ext2" will help,
too.
