I consider 16-byte code alignment as way too big.
P4 zealots can demand even more I guess :(
I will happily change my mind when/if I'll see
favorable speed/kernel size benchmarks. Until then,
I think 4-byte alignment is closest to sanity.
Not exactly P4 related but: if you tell gcc your
processor has cmov, gcc will try to use it.
Results: 
* gcc code is worse with cmov than without
* some CPUs (Cyrix?) have slow cmovs (microcoded?)
* you lose whenever you try to use your code
  on cmov-less CPU.
Dave, I am absolutely sure _you_ do not compile
for P4 needlessly, but lots of ordinary people
do that just to be hip. I wanted to point out
why it may be undesirable.

It hurts even more when you need to recompile
gcc,glibc,X,KDE,mozilla,etc etc etc :)
I payed no attention when I compiled stuff on my home Duron...
From the moment when I tried to revive oldie 486
I started to ./configure everything for 386 ;)
