Don't do this. The "x" passed in may be "sb", and then you end up with 
bogus code.
I think the solution to these kinds of things is either
 - just bite the bullet, and make it out-of-line. A function call isn't 
   that expensive, and is sometimes actually cheaper due to I$ issues.
 - have a separate trivial header file, and only include it for people who 
   actually need these things (very few files, actually - it's usually 
   just one file per filesystem)
In this case, since it's _so_ simple, and since it's _so_ specialized, I 
think #2 is the right one. Normally, uninlining would be.
