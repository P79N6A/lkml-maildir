Good Day My Good Friend,
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting the fund transferred under
the cooperation of a new partner from paraguay. Presently i'm in Paraguay for
investment projects with my own share of the total sum.
Meanwhile, i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in
transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how. Now contact my
secretary,his name is George Martins and his email address is
geomartins_private@yahoo.com ask him to send you the total $800.000.00 in a
Certificate Bank Draft which i kept for your compensation for all the past
efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter.
I appreciated your efforts atthat time very much. so feel free and get in
touched with my secretary George Martins and instruct him where to send the
amount to you. Please do let! me know immediately you receive it so that we can
share the joy after all the sufferness at that time. in the moment, i am very
busy here because of the investment projects which me and the new partner are
having at hand.
Finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your
behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with George Martins
and he will send the amount to you without any delay.
Regards.
Mr.Amoussou Andre
