I think i know the cause of the problem, i'll test it later. You had
to be careful with 'install' directives in modprobe.conf to not cause
circular dependencies, and i think maybe this is the problem. But this
shouldn't trash the kernel with a lot of processes in D state that 
cannot be killed...

I was wrong, xine and aMule had nothing to do with the problem. Just a
'modprobe snd' triggers the problem.
