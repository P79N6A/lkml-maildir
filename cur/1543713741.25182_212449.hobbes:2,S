Firstly, most of the first (full) chart supports my measurements. 
There's the portion of the chart at around 500k working set that is at
issue, which area you've magnified so helpfully [ ;-) ].
That area of the curve is quite suspect at first sight. With a TLB flush
every 1 msec [*], for a 'double digit' slowdown to happen it means the
effect of the TLB flush has to be on the order of 100-200 usecs. This is
near impossible, the dTLB+iTLB on your CPU is only 64+64. This means
that a simple mmap() or a context-switch done by a number-cruncher
(which does a TLB flush too) would have a 100-200 usecs secondary cost -
this has never been seen or reported before!
but it is well-known that most complex numeric benchmarks are extremely
sensitive to the layout of pages - e.g. my dTLB-sensitive benchmark is
so sensitive that i easily get runs that are 2 times faster on 4:4 than
on 3:1, and the 'results' are extremely stable and repeatable on the
same kernel!
to eliminate layout effects, could you do another curve? Plain -aa4 (no
4:4 patch) but a __flush_tlb() added before and after do_IRQ(), in
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c? This should simulate much of the TLB flushing
effect of 4:4 on -aa4, without any of the other layout changes in the
kernel. [it's not a full simulation of all effects of 4:4, but it should
simulate the TLB flush effect quite well.]
once the kernel image layout has been stabilized via the __flush_tlb()
thing, the way to stabilize user-space layout is to static link the
benchmark and boot it via init=/bin/DOUBLE. This ensures that the
placement of the physical pages is constant. Doing the test 'fresh after
bootup' is not good enough.

[*] a nitpick: you keep saying '2000 tlb flushes per second'. This is
    misleading, there's one flush of the userspace TLBs every 1 msec
    (i.e. 1000 per second), and one flush of the kernel TLBs - but
    the kernel TLBs are small at this point, especially with 4MB pages.
