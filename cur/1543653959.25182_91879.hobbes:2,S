If you manage to remove arch/*/vmlinux.lds, we can continue this 
discussion. I need the module linker script for very much the same 
reasons.

Well, if you kill processes with SIGKILL, you get exactly what you ask 
for.

Think _very_ carefully about what I wrote earlier:
"Overall this means all module tasks become nicely separated. During build 
we prepare the module with all the information the kernel needs, the 
loader takes care of dependencies and just relocates the module, modfs 
maps it into the kernel and starts the module. If the interfaces are 
halfway flexible, changes in one part don't require a change somewhere 
else."
This is the basic design goal and I will not change it without a very good 
reason.
Otherwise I stop this discussion here, I doubt you will get _anyone_ to 
implement the features you want. It also makes little sense to discuss 
details of an implementation, which doesn't exist yet. As soon as it does 
exist, you are free to implement whatever you want on top of it. If you 
get anyone to look at it without a barf bag, I'll consider it. If you 
think you can do better, try to implement your own module loader, I think 
it will be an interesting learning experience for you.
bye, Roman
