Jon, thanks a lot!
This is great news. I wonder if converting tasklets to work queues also
helps with other softirqs.  Before, softirqs could not preempt a
tasklet, since tasklets run as a softirq. With tasklets as work queues,
what's left as a softirq can now preempt tasklets. Perhaps this can even
help with performance.
