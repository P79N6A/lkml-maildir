sure - but these are all Layer-8 (politics) and layer-9 (religion) issues.
typically Service Providers on this side of the planet handle that side of 
things via SLAs internal to their own network.  i.e. "we guarantee X% 
uptime, less than Y% packet-loss across our own core network as measured 
using XXYYZZ method".
the fact that an IP packet may have a PPP header on it across one hop, a 
HDLC header across another, perhaps some MPLS labels across another, 
802.1q-in-802.1q across another is generally immaterial.
if you did want to get fancy and account for it, at least you have 
packet-counters on a per-socket basis from which to do that with.
without per-socket accounting, you just don't have that anyway.
cheers,
lincoln.
