These are live dentries but not really detached, they are still attached to
the hash list. And yes I don't see shrink_dcache_sb holding the umount
because of these dentries. I assume dput of such dentries will happen
from different paths. But I am not sure if we could even end up in this
situation where we have landed up in shrink_dcache_sb from unmount path
and there are still some inuse dentries present. Need some clarification here.

When a dentry is queued for RCU freeing, there will be no references to
it from anywhere. It wouldn't be on hash list or on lru list. So I would think
only those dentries which are really freeable are queued for RCU freeing.
I see that shrink_dcache_sb is being called from the remount path
(do_remount_sb).
I couldn't understand why we do this. AFAICS we anyway don't modify the
mountpoint or the mount root during remount. Woudn't it be advantageous to
leave those dentries on LRU ?
