This is just because the scheduler balancing is not aware of nice and when two 
same niceness tasks are on the same physical core they get equal shares. The 
ht-aware nice only works at keeping different nice values on the same 
physical core fair. There is no more that can be done using the current ht 
aware mechanism; a far more complicated balancing algorithm that takes nice 
into account would be required.
