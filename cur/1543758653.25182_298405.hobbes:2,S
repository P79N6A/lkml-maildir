Is it possible to merge BSD and CSA? I mean with CSA, there is a part
that does per-process accounting. For exemple in the
linux-2.6.9.acct_mm.patch the two functions update_mem_hiwater() and
csa_update_integrals() update fields in the current (and parent)
process. So maybe you can improve the BSD per-process accounting or
maybe CSA can replace the BSD per-process accounting?
