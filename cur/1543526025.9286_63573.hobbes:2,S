Nah. The user should use the intel/bios manufacturer tool to tell the
BIOS that there is a new microcode image. There is an API call to give
the BIOS a new microcode, which it will subsequently download to the
CPU on the next boot.
Hey, the nasty thing is that we will continue to report the old mask
level, as the "what's this CPU" stuff is only done at boot time right?
