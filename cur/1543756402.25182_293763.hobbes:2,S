precisely my point (see my previous, very long post).
obviously it's not us who defines what 'code injection' is but the laws
of physics and the laws of computer science. Restricting to the native
CPU's machine code format may cover an important special-case, but it
will prevent arbitrary code execution just as much as a house that has a
locked door but an open window, where the owner defines "burglary" as
"the bad guy tries to open the door". Correct in a sense, but not secure
in guaranteed way :-|
