What do you mean?  If you define legacy I/O space to be 
0x0000000000000000-0x000000000000ffff, then yes of course you're right.  But 
if you mean being able to access legacy ports at all, then no.  On SGI 
machines, there's a per-bus base address that can be used as the base for 
port I/O, which is what I was getting at.

There is no resource for some of the I/O port space that cards respond to.  I 
can set the I/O BAR of my VGA card to 0x400 and it'll still respond to 
accesses at 0x3bc for example.  That's what I mean by legacy space--space 
that cards respond to but don't report in their PCI resources.
