I like kseriod and kgameportd to be frozen. If fast resume of serio
port fails we kick the task of full resume to kseriod. But when we
hibernate and all the devices are resumed again so snapshot can be
written I don't care if touchpad failed to resume - it can be dealt
with later, when system is actually resumes. So I like that by
freezing I do not delay hibernation and all requests get simply
discarded as they are not in the image. This mostly affects
hibernation though.
Having these threads frozen also guarantees that serio/gameport device
tree is stable during susped/resume and I can process outstanding
requests later, when system is fully up.
