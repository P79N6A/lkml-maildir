    Not on a single-user machine it isn't.
    You're forgetting that this is Unix, and a Unix kernel is a marvelously
    adaptable thing.   I'm not talking about taking a dos+devfs kernel and
    putting it onto a publicly accessable multiuser Posix box, but taking
    the kernel and putting a custom userland on it for an installer, a
    firewall, a (hypothetical) Linux+WINE upgrade to Windows, or a single
    disk toy to annoy the purists.

      Devfs doesn't exist for 2.0.28.   I'm talking about 2.6, because
      if the feature freeze is in, devfs won't be going into 2.4 and
      I'll be waiting for 2.6 to rev Mastodon's kernel from 2.0.28.
      I've already done all the kludges to get the gory details out
      of the kernel for 2.0.28.
