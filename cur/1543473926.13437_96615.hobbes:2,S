Because PCs are sold on slim margins, IDE is a lot cheaper (cheaper still
if you can get away with "broken" :) and the performance problems it has
won't show up in one-user boxen.
If you want a high-end PC, buy yourself a machine certified as "Novell
server" or the equivalent.  Steep price I'l guarantee. TANSTAAFL.
