it's worth automating these repetative bits. I use small templates when 
creating patches. Also, it's worth running patches through 
scripts/checkpatch.pl - it has a check for exactly this typo. [ Not a 
big issue at all, i just mentioned it in case you get a taste for 
sending more sem2mutex patches :-) ]
