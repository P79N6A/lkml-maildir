Hi,
I have a requirement where I need to collect 2.6
kernel statistics in the following areas, Please tell
me any other utilities tools other than which I have
listed:
Kernel code path tracing - ?
n/w and tcp/ip       - sar, tcpdump
i/o        - iostat
FileSystem - ?? (what can be useful statistics say for
ext3, iSCSI, nfs)
Threads/Process - ??
Scheduler - ?? (Something which can give scheduler
latency, average wait time spent in runqueue)
CPU - ?? (Some Load Balancing statistics in smp,
hyperthreading in uniprocessor)
many thanks.
