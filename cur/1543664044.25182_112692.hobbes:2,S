IBM's forthcoming Power5 will have two cores, each with SMT (the generic
term for HyperThreading); it will present itself to the OS as four
processors. Those four processors, however, are not equal; SMT is certainly
valuable, but it can only be as effective as mutliple cores if it in effect
*becomes* multiple cores (and, as such, turns into SMP).
I'm writing a chapter on memory architectures in my parallel programming
book; it's giving me a bit of a headache, as the issues you raise are both
important and complex. We have multiple levels of caches, NUMA
architectures, clusters, SMP, HT... the list just goes on and on, infinite
in diversity and combinations. Vendors will continue to experiment; I doubt
very much that any one architecture will take center stage.
I hope Linux handles the brain-sprain better than I am at the moment! ;)
