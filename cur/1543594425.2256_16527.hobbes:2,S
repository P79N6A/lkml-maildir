There's an easy answer that should work well on both servers and laptops, 
that goes something like this: when memory pressure has been brought to 0, if 
there there is plenty of disk bandwidth available, continue writeout for a 
while and clean some extra pages.  In other words, any episode of pageouts 
is followed immediately by a short episode of preemptive cleaning.
This gives both the preemptive cleaning we want in order to respond to the 
next surge, and lets the laptop disk spin down.  The definition of 'for a 
while' and 'plenty of disk bandwidth' can be tuned, but I don't think either 
is particularly critical.
As a side note, the good old multisecond delay before bdflush kicks in 
doesn't really make a lot of sense - when bandwidth is available the 
filesystem-initiated writeouts should happen right away.
It's not necessary or desirable to write out more dirty pages after the 
machine has been idle for a while, if only because the longer it's idle the 
less the 'surge protection' matters in terms of average throughput.
