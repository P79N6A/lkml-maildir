The xfs patches for 2.4.19 have been respun as of 2002-09-27 04:22 UTC.
This removes kbuild 2.5 support and includes several changes in the
xfs/kernel interface.
For some time the XFS group have been producing split patches for XFS,
separating the core XFS changes from additional patches such as kdb,
xattr, acl, dmapi.  The split patches are released to the world with
the hope that developers and distributors will find them useful.
Read the README in each directory very carefully, the split patch
format has changed over a few kernel releases.  Any questions that are
covered by the README will be ignored.  There is even a 2.4.20/README
for the terminally impatient :).
