This just makes x86_64 behave like i386 which sets the flag today.
With tick-broadcast, even though we handle timer tick happening
anywhere, it will be nice if timer always goes to CPU 0 and we then
broadcast to any other CPUs. This is not a must have patch from my
perspective. But, we should make i386 and x86_64 same. So, we need to
change either one.
Thanks,
Venki
