Something could be done:
we could enable drivers to have DMA-pools they manage that get mapped
and are re-used.
I would rather the DMA-pools be tied to PID's that way any bad behavior
would be limited to the address space of the process using the device.
I haven't thought about how hard this would be to do but it would be
nice.  I think this could be tricky.
Application sets up ring buffer of device DMA memory, passes this to
driver/stack.  Need to handle hitting high water marks and application
exit clean up sanely...
