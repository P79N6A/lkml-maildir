Hmm..
The MP tables mention IRQ's up to 51, but no further.
But the PIRQ routing tables talk about irqs 92-95 for bus 6.
It really looks like the IRQ routing entries are just broken. One 
potential fix is to enable ACPI, and hope that the ACPI irq routing isn't 
as broken as the PIRQ stuff.
Other than that I don't see anything we can do. Anybody else?
