Hello,
I am trying to build a fast proxy (SQUID) with a high load (4800 clients).
To test it, I used Polygraph and receive error message like "Cannot assign
requested address".
Is it because there are too many connextions at a time ?
What are the parameters to change ?
MAX_WINDOW   and MIN_WINDOW  ? (I guess yes!)
MAX_LINKS ?
ip_local_port_ranges ?
I read the docs in the kernel tree (Documentation) but are there more detail
examples somewhere ?
Any advices are welcome !
Thanks
L. Giacobbe
