I think what Martin is trying to say, in his oh so eloquent way, is that
the difference between 'non-exclusive' cpusets and, say, CKRM
taskclasses isn't very clear.  It seems to me that non-exclusive cpusets
are little more than a convenient way to group tasks.  Now, I'm not
saying that I don't think that is a useful functionality, but I am
saying that cpusets seem like the wrong way to go about it.

Ok.  These imaginary 'soft' partitions sound much like what I expected
'exclusive' cpusets to be based on the terminology.  They also sound
exactly like what I am trying to implement through my sched_domains
work.

I don't know that these partitions would necessarily need their own
scheduler, allocator and resource manager, or if we would just make the
current scheduler, allocator and resource manager aware of these
boundaries.  In either case, that is an implementation detail not to be
agonized over now.

Agreed.  I'm not proposing that we rip out sched_set/getaffinity, mbind,
etc.  What I'm saying is that tasks should not *default* to using these
mechanisms because, at least in their current incarnations, our
scheduler and allocator are written in such a way that these mechanisms
are secondary.  The assumption is that the scheduler/allocator can
schedule/allocate wherever they choose.  The scheduler does look at
these bindings and if they contradict the decision made we deal with
that after the fact.  The allocator has longer code paths and more logic
to deal with if there are bindings in place.  So our options are to
either:
1) find a way to not have to rely on these mechanisms for most/all tasks
in the system, or 
2) rewrite the scheduler/allocator to deal with these bindings up front,
and take them into consideration early in the scheduling/allocating
process.

I must also plead ignorance to the gritty details of CKRM.  It would
seem to me, from discussions on this thread, that CKRM could be made to
deal with 'isolated' domains, 'soft' partitions, or 'exclusive' cpusets
without TOO much headache.  Basically just telling CKRM that the tasks
in this group are sharing CPU time from a pool of 4 CPUs, rather than
all 16 CPUs in the system.  Hubertus?  As far as supporting fine grained
binding inside domains, that should definitely be supported in any
solution worthy of acceptance.  CKRM, to the best of my knowledge,
currently deals with cpus_allowed, and there's no reason to think that
it wouldn't be able to deal with cpus_allowed in the multiple domain
case.

That's not really the reason that I was arguing against half of
cpusets.  My argument is not related to CKRM's requirements, as I really
don't know what those are! :)  My argument is that I don't see what
non-exclusive cpusets buys us.  If all we're looking for is basic
task-grouping functionality, I'm quite certain that we can implement
that in a much more light-weight way that doesn't conflict with the
scheduler's decision making process.  In fact, for non-exclusive
cpusets, I'd say that we can probably implement that type of
task-grouping in a non-intrusive way that will complement the scheduler
and possibly even improve performance by giving the scheduler a hint
about which tasks should be scheduled together.  Using cpus_allowed is
not that way.  cpus_allowed should be reserved for what it was
originally meant for: specifying a *strict* subset of CPUs that a task
is restricted to running on.
