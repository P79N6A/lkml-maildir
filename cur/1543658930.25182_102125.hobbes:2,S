Um.. hey!  Just because we weren't trying to merge with you during 2.5
for a long time doesn't mean we weren't tracking development.  Looking
at our CVS history, we've merged your tree into ours in:
 2.5.26
 2.5.32
 2.5.41
 2.5.43
 2.5.44
 2.5.45
 2.5.46
 2.5.47
 2.5.50
 2.5.51
 2.5.53
 2.5.54
Our outstanding diff vs your tree is about 200k gzipped and it's almost
all drivers.  Off the top of my head, I can't think of any core changes
we still need.  I don't think we're using any deprecated interfaces
(eg flush_page_to_ram, unlike m68k, mips, mips64, sparc32 & v850).
Of course, I don't consider having working PA-RISC in your tree to be
a prerequisite for release.  I just object to being used as an example :-P
