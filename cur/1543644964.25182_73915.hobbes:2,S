My excerience with a JBOD box is the in kernel driver locking up with the "no 
handle slots, this should not happen" message in half an hour running a 4 MB/sec 
write load.
Then tried the feral.com driver. That one was stable with the same load. Ran 
that one for a month or two.
Then came along the highio patch in -AA. Made me want to switch to the in kernel 
qlogic driver again. This was a good time to try a patch by Andrew Patterson, 
AFAIR upping the number of slots to 255 and fixing the calculations around them. 
This has been running without problems for a few months now.
The patch has been posted to the list. It can be found at

I never tried Qlogic's driver, probably because of all the versions floating around.
