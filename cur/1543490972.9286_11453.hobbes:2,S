The plug does a great job, but appears to be rather a trick to me.
I also disagree with Eric about the plug to be a crap.
Btw, this time I am globally fine with your opinion, and also against the
creator of the offending object. ;-)

The plugging will probably get not enough if we ever want to ensure some 
ordering of actual IOs to be guaranteed to upper layers.
This lets me think that actual IO-subsystems should never have to care
about plugging mechanism, but just be provided with IO requests.
The incomplete get_queue() stuff is bad since it requires IO-subsystem 
to care about plugging.
I will see no problem with the plugging until we would want to deal with 
ordering and I agree that it is currently doing a great job, but just
wanted it not to become kind of IO-subsystems polluation.
