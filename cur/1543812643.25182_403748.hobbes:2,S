I forgot to mention that the DVD drive was not automatically recognized:
ata1: PATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0x1F0 ctl 0x3F6 bmdma 0x18F0 irq 14
ata1: dev 0 cfg 49:0f00 82:0218 83:4000 84:4000 85:0218 86:0000 87:4000
88:041f
ata1: dev 0 ATAPI, max UDMA/66
ata1: dev 0 configured for UDMA/33
scsi0 : ata_piix
ata1(0): WARNING: ATAPI is disabled, device ignored.
Is this still as described in
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Problems_with_SATA_and_Linux
under "DVD drive not recognized"?  Perhaps I'll be able to do some tests
on that later, too.
Best regards
