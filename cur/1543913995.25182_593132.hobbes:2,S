Namespace clashes.  Now that class attributes are gone (or going, whatever),
everything lives in one namespace: the device.  I dread the day I find out
one class I need has attribute name clashes with another, or (more likely)
one of my driver-specific attributes clash with one from a generic class.
Even if clashes never happen, it can make quite a mess when you have four or
more classes in the same device. And you can have semanthic clashes, if one
looks at various attributes (from different classes or driver-specific) and
think they are related in some obvious way (only, it is not obvious at all,
and the user didn't read the docs to know it).
It is nothing too serious, but something to keep in mind when deciding what
to do with a big driver.
