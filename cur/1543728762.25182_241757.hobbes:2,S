#   kbuild: Use POSIX headers for ntoh functions
#   
#   From: Benno <benjl@cse.unsw.edu.au>
#   When compiling Linux on Mac OSX I had trouble with scripts/sumversion.c.
#   It includes <netinet/in.h> to obtain to definitions of htonl and ntohl.
#   
#   On Mac OSX these are found in <arpa/inet.h>. After checking the POSIX
#   specification it appears that this is the correct place to get
#   the definitons for these functions.
#   
#   (
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/htonl.html
)
#   
#   Using this header also appears to work on Linux (at least with
#   Glibc-2.3.2).
#   
#   It seems clearer to me to go with the POSIX standard than implementing
#   #if __APPLE__ style macros, but if such an approach is preferred I can
#   supply patches for that instead.
