Hello!
Why don't you take the route that Jeff Dike did with UML's skas mode?
List the patches in your site and release plex86-v2 that requires this 
host patches to run.
If the results are really good lots of people will use it and you'll end 
up with a number of people asking in lkml "why is the plex86-v2 patch 
not available in Linus' tree?" ;)
Regards,
Nuno Silva
