Yes, we did. We saw a bad_page() error on the console. A page
was freed with the active bit set.

If we add the pages to the appropriate list at the time of page_add_*rmap(),
we would end up with too many code changes split
all over the place. In many cases when we add a page (install_page()
for example), we just release any existing mapping. We would not know
where to add the page -- active list or inactive list?
I am not sure if that was your question in the first place :-)
