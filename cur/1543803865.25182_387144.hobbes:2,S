Alan's point is still very valid.  From a poweruser point of view, if  
I specifically tell my wireless client "You must obey US laws", and  
then I wander over past a broken imported AP, I don't want my client  
to _expand_ its allowable range.  IMHO, userspace should be able to  
forcibly restrict wireless frequencies to a certain regdomain (or  
leave unrestricted and passive-scan-only), and specify how AP/ 
configured regdomains act.  Given the range of possibilities, I think  
that a userspace daemon monitoring events and dynamically configuring  
the useable frequencies would best.  That way the userspace daemon  
could be configured to ignore APs, union/intersect the APs with the  
configured regdomain, ignore the configured regdomain in the presence  
of APs, etc.
