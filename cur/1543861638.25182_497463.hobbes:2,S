Sounds like you're using TI's tree. In that case please contact TI for
support.
If you want to use the current git tree, please see:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/tmlind/linux-omap-2.6.git;a=summary
and
http://muru.com/linux/omap
Only minimal 2340 code is currently merged in the linux-omap git tree,
so YMMV.
Regards,
Tony
