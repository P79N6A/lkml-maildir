FWIW, SELinux now has a notion of a type hierarchy in its policy, so the
root admin can carve out a portion of the policy space and allow less
privileged admins to then define sub-types that are strictly constrained
by what was allowed to the parent type by the root admin.  This is
handled in userspace, with the policy mediation performed by a userspace
agent (daemon, policy management server), which then becomes the focal
point for all policy loading.
