For small n, it shouldn't make a difference. With early exit, best
case you end up walking half the chain on average, worst case you hit
the quadratic behavior. Given that the likelihood of contention rises
with chain length, we tend to lean towards the latter for larger n.
For try-them-all, we test n in all cases. So we've got [n/2] < n <
n^2/2. The try-them-all approach wins by virtue of being deterministic
and nicely bounded.
Oh, another concern is that early-exit lets sources in the front of
the chain starve the remainder and doing bookkeeping on
last-ISR-succeeded so that we can have some sort of fairness is just
not worth the trouble. So nix on the whole idea.
