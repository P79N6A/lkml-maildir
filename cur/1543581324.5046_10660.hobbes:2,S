I know. It was just an ironic comment: we have a card with a 64-bit PCI 
bus, we have a 64-bit system which very likely has some 64-bit PCI slots 
on its motherboard, perfect match, right? Well, au contraire, the 
performance is going to suck big-time, at least for Rx.

I won't get into this...

Amusing? Maybe. Zerocopy will still help with Tx, and with Rx we're just 
trying to contain the damage, *with the existent stack*.

See my previous mail. It turned out to be just a confused chipset.
Thanks,
