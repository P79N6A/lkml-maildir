I'm thinking that the best approach would be to define a cpu_sibling_map() macro
to handle the cases where cpu_sibling_map is not a per_cpu variable?  Perhaps
something like:
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
#ifndef cpu_sibling_map
#define cpu_sibling_map(cpu)    cpu_sibling_map[cpu]
#endif
#endif
My question though, would include/linux/smp.h be the appropriate place for
the above define?  (That is, if the above approach is the correct one... ;-)
Thanks,
Mike
