The gcc people tested it, and their cut-off point is at 30kB or so.
Anything smaller than that is faster to just "read()".
Now, that's a traditional mmap(), though, which has more overhead than a
"read-with-PAGE_COPY" would have. The pure mmap() approach has the actual
page fault overhead too, along with having to do "fstat()" and "munmap()".
