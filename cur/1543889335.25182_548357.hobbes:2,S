The numbers you posted in <46534C31.1060306@debianpt.org> are not the 
same... From my inbox I grab some very non-matching values:
=====
Here's the funny part...
Lets call:
a) to "random number of processes run while glxgears is running", 
gl_fairloops file
b) to "generated frames while running a burst of processes" aka "massive 
and uknown amount of operations in one process", gl_gears file
kernel    2.6.21-cfs-v13    2.6.21-ck2
a)    194464        254669       
b)    54159        124
=====
The numbers in your glitch1.html file show a close correlation for cfs 
and -ck2, well within what I would expect. The stddev for the loops is 
larger for -cf2, but not out of line with what I see, and nothing like 
the numbers you originally sent me (which may have been testing 
something else, or from an old version before I made improvements, or 
???). In any case thanks for testing.

Thanks, those data seem as expected.
