The patch you are referring to contains very little code that affects chip
programming without user intervention (e.g. calling ethtool ioctls). There
is one notable exception: The patch introduces rhine_shutdown which is
called at shutdown (well, duh!). I suppose you can make the problem go away
if you comment out parts of said function. I'd start at the bottom with the
D3 call.
