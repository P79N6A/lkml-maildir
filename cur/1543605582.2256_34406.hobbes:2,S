You can switch to the regular console using some key. You probably don't want 
bug reports from users who can't even do this, so basically it's a filter :)

No, the LPP screen remains until X starts. You set the progress by writing to 
a file called /proc/progress. So there is a patch (at least for debian) that 
changes the init scripts to report the progress of booting. You can easily 
calculate the percentage when you count the scripts in /etc/rcX that you have 
to start.
