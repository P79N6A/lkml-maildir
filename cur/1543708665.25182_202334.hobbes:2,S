Yup.

That's good enough for me.  I tested that before trying this better
approach, and it worked.

It's not the code generation that is improved, it's just that we can
then refrain from pushing and popping something that nobody cares
about.  It would have worked to just assign a random value to p4 and
p5 after the asm loop; it would be dead anyway.  As long as we made
sure p4 and p5 weren't shared with anything else before, that is.
