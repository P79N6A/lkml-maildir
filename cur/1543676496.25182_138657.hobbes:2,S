FWIW, I seem to recall Windows doing this in older version, but with XP
it's very good about noticing link death, and killing things off.
I like the "correct" behavior much better, especially when dealing with
a combination of ethernet cables that have finicky ends and laptops that
get moved a little bit.  (Poof - cable slips out, all connections drop,
waste 5 minutes getting things retarted.)
