Hey all,
Still working with kernel 2.4.0-test9 (other things we use require it for
now), and I was looking at a driver for a Znyx zx346q network card that I
grabbed from the znyx.com website.  The driver is for a 2.2.x kernel, but
figuring I'd try it anyway, downloaded and tried to build it.  It choked on
three struct net_device entries which are no longer present:
zxe.c:1200: structure has no member named `tbusy'
zxe.c:1201: structure has no member named `interrupt'
zxe.c:1202: structure has no member named `start'
...
make[2]: *** [zxe.o] Error 1                              
Where do I go from here?  Is there info somewhere to help with this?  Is
this a bigger job than it looks on the surface?
Cheers!
Jon
