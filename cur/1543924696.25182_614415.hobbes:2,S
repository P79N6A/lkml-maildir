Btw, I'd also like to take the opportunitity to ask people to always 
include the explanation of the commit when you give a commit ID.
"git revert" does that for the commit it reverts, but the (bogus) commit 
ID that was apparently added by David (c129d962a) didn't get the 
explanation for it, so now it's totally impossible to match it up with 
anything at all..
So let me one more say:
 - don't just say 
	.. was cured by commit xyz
 - but add the one-liner description of the commit, something along the 
   lines of
	.. was cured by commit xyz ("PCI: Add quirk for devices which 
        disable MSI when INTX_DISABLE is set.")
so that the commit messages are readable even outside git.
