Hi,
 I want to know to what extent can Linux be made bare boned for use.
 Eg: Could I have only the 
1)Scheduler
2)Boot -loader(via TFTP / Flash)
3)Thread support
4)Debugger 
I am using the 2.4.x kernel here and really want to know whether the above is really possible for a stand alone system application to run.
