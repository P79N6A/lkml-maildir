It is not a bug.
Looking more carefully at the Oops, it seems that this problem is
occurring inside an nfs_rename() in which the target name belongs to
an open file - and thus needs to be sillyrenamed first.
In that case, we certainly do not want to rehash the dentry in order
to do the d_move() since that would give rise to a race: we want to do
a real rename into the same dentry after we're done with the
sillyrename.
I can agree that the patch was flawed, but I still believe that we do
need to allow d_move to work with unhashed dentries.
Cheers,
