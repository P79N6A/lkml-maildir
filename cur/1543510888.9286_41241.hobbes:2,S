Yes, CPUs are manufactured for a wide range of clocks.  And CPUs are
more or less self contained, the internal operation is decoupled from
the FSB (except for the multiplier of course).  Therefore they are
quite easy to overclock.

But PCI chips are manufactured solely for a 33MHz bus clock, there is
no excess capability planned. Overclocking may work, but with different
success.  Graphics cards may give pixel errors when run too fast, or
they don't.  But they won't kill your data.
However, according to c't (which did overclocking tests on PCI), SCSI
controllers can almost be expected to fail.  Probably because they
drive some internal clock from PCI or the chips are clocked from PCI
and, unlike CPUs, are built only for 33MHz.  SCSI controllers are
apparently coupled to the bus clock tighter than other devices.
Other types of cards probably make less problems.
