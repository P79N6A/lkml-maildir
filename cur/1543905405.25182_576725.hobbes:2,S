Greetings;
As in something in the rpc daemons started at boot time grabbed localhost:783, 
which is SA's local port.  I had to kill fetchmail, get x working, edit the 
services to kill the rpc stuff and reboot before spamassassin would start.
As spamassassin (spamd) is pretty important, that didn't seem to be very nice.  
As I don't use NFS here, that's no great loss.
Comments anyone?
