Seems reasonable.  If a save_state is refused, I assume you
restore_state for all other devices and bring the system from a
half-working state [at the time the suspend was rejected] to a
full-working state?
Consider that it will take some amount of time to stop pending I/O
requests.  You might want to walk the tree, and tell devices "start
saving", and then walk the tree again and say "finish saving."
