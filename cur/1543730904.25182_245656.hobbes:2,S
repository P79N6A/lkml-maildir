1. I wasn't talking about reiser4 plugins, not about the
   file-as-a-directory thing or file streams
2. reiser4 doesn't currently have those
3. I don't really like file streams
:-)
But I'm using ACLs on a server and had to forward-port an rsync patch to
make full backups using rsync possible. That's not really better.
