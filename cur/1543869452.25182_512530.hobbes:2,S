We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.19.5 kernel.
It contains a number of bugfixes, and all 2.6.19 users are recommended
to upgrade.
There will be one more 2.6.19 based release, due to all of the patches
that people have sent in after the review set of patches for this
release was posted.  So if you have sent in new patches, don't worry if
you do not see them in this release, they should be taken care of next
week.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.19.4 and 2.6.19.5, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.19.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.19.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
        www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
