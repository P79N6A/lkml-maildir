Actually I think this patch needs to be handled delicately -- because
based on earlier emails from Jesse
(
http://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg22254.html
),
I am pretty sure that "pattern" is a typo for "patent".  So I guess
the question is what exactly the patent covers and what the
implications of having the current kernel code are.
