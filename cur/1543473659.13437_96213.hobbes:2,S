I tried it a long time ago, and up till now, i've been constantly
running 2.1.xx kernels with HZ = 1024... The only thing i noticed that
went wrong was top.. top reported all programs 99.9%...
However, i think defining HZ = 1024 is the right thing to do, so timing
(synching) games etc becomes a lot easier...
