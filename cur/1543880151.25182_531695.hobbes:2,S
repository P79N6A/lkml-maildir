This isn't universally true. Look at Java, for example, which Sun recently 
released parts of under an open source license -- not the CDDL, not a 
CDDL/xxx dual license, the GPL proper.
Indeed, Sun already have products that are dual licensed CDDL/GPL, for example 
the J2EE product.

I couldn't speculate on the rationale, but it does seem that Sun's choice to 
use _only_ the CDDL with certain software (like ZFS) is deliberate.
