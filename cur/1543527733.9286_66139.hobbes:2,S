	Hello,
	I've upgraded to 2.3.48 and found that new dualhead feature, it is 
almost working here. I'm in Spain, so PAL is what I need, but when I set 
fb1 to PAL (matroxset 1) and then map it to the output I get the 
following:
	Monitor -> Monitor  works perfectly
	NTSC -> PAL	    works but no color!?!?
	PAL -> PAL 	    I get color but I also get horizontal green bars
			    they seem to xor the normal image.
	The other combinations haven't been tested or just doesn't work.
	Other thing I would like to know is if it is normal than when you 
switch virtual console the image on the second output gets frozen and 
isn't updage until you change to the original console. For example if I 
try fbtv using the dualhead (I know ... TV on TV isn't new :-) the image 
on the monitor gets frozen when I change the virtual console to one 
different that the console from which I launch the fbtv program.
	More info on demmand
