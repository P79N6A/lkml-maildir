Hi,
I've started using Ingo's raid0145 990128 kernel patch with kernel
2.2.1., It's setup pretty much according to the raidtools RAID5.HOWTO,
with 32k chunks, across 3 1gb partitions on 2 uw scsi disks and 1 fn
scsi disk.
it works very well, and machine stays quite responsive even when doing a
bonnie -s 300 on the raid array.
however: if i run rc5des (latest mmx client) and do a bonnie, the
loadavg goes through the roof (to 10 or so) the machine really bogs
down, until eventually things start segfaulting.. it all dies down when
eventually bonnie segfaults.
the strange things is that i can't restart rc5des or the the rc5des
proxy keyserver after that, they both segfault. (even with a fresh
tarball). if i reboot everything is ok until again - until i run raid
and rc5des together again.
Is there some kind of problem with RAID and the rc5des client that they
clobber each other in some way?

memory: 64MB DIMM, tested it when i bought it (6 months ago) with the
memcheck86 utility on sunsite - no errors after running for a day.
