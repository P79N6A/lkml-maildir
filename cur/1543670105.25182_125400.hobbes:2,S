Hi,
With kernel 2.4.21pre7 as well as kernel 2.4.21pre7-ac1 I get a message
about a "kernel BUG at filemap.c:81!" (see below). The message comes
"from time to time" (but the system seems to keep running without
problems). The bug can be reproduced by doing a hdparm -tT. The T part
(disk reads) is not completed but the message below is displayed.
The Kernel is also patched with the latest acpi patch as well as with
the i810 (lite) framebuffer driver.
A full dmesg along with an lspci can be found at
http://www.wnk.at/tmp/dmesg.txt
 and
http://www.wnk.at/tmp/lspci.txt
kernel message when running "hdparm -tT"; system keeps running:
