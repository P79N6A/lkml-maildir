The min() macro got changed. You might want to #undef it and make
your own because this will be a political thing that won't go
away until Linus rules.
'min' is most often used to select a value that is the smaller
of a request length and a buffer length. A lot of software that
uses this function (macro) doesn't respect signed-ness or size.
This can cause problems. A universal solution doesn't exist because
an unsigned compare, which is most often what you want, isn't
mathematically correct and the comparison between an 'int' and
a 'long' is okay for some architectures and bogus for others.
Adding another parameter to a macro, which will ultimately be
used for a cast, is ugly. The casts, if necessary, should be
in the code.
So, I suggest you just define your own, which is correct for your
code.
Cheers,

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
