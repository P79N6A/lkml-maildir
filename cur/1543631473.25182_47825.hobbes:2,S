Hmm, last time we were discussing you were saying that only 80 wire
cables work, and I was saying that short enough 40 wire cables are OK as
well (even in some older revision of the spec) ....
... interesting.
Anyway, 40 wire cables can really only work with a single drive and have
to be really short. And, Linux should only use UDMA33 and lower on
them, because it can't know the length of the cable.
