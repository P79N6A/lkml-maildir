You're right, we can't do that for anonymous buffers right now. Mea culpa.
Looking more at this issue, I suspect that the easiest pretty solution
that everybody can probably agree is reasonable is to either pass down the
end-of-io callback to ll_rw_block as you suggested, or, preferably by just
forcing the _caller_ to do the buffer locking, and just do the b_end_io
stuff inside the buffer lock and get rid of all the races that way
instead (and make ll_rw_block() verify that the buffers it is passed are
always locked).
