Yes, it is OK. Actually, the counting depends on link speed.
If it is enough high to hold rtt for MTU sized frame <= 200msec,
it is better not to violate this bound. If it is so low, that
this bound cannot be achieved in any case, it should be selected
so that queue_size/rate enough to make ssh/telnet more-or-less responsive.

Well, it is not so complicated. However, with small queue_size/rate
effect of such change is visible only if TCP window is set to small
value < queue_size (counting overhead).

No. Actually, ideal variant is when driver holds the lowest possible
number of queued packets. It is 1 for slow drivers or higher number
for fast one. F.e. 2 is enough for 10Mbit ethernet, 16 is enough
for 100Mbit one.

Alas, it will not.
for (;;) {
	s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
	sendto(s,  ...);
	close(s);
}
will kill machine reliably and almost instantly, if driver queue
is unlimited.
