With an nfs mounted directory I do a find, and have things updateing the X
display at the same time and after a while networking becomes sluggish and
sometimes goes down altogether.
To show it has nothing to do with nfs I wrote a small program that used tcp
and dumped data from the remote computer to the local computer.  The two
computers are connected by a crossover running at fullduplex 100baseT.  The
remote computer has the same network card with two intel cpu's and never
has any problem.  It seems to have the most problem when the problem
computer is receiving data.  My test program goes from 10.5 MBytes/s and
will slow down progressively to 2MBytes/s and stop some times.  The video
card also has to be updated at the same time.  Play an animation, or just
flipping back and forth between X desktops along with lots of network
activity causes networking to stop.
I ifconfig down the network, remove the module 3c59x.o and get this
message,
unregister_netdevice: Old style device eth0 leaked(refcnt=1). Wait for crash.
When I insert the 3c59x.o module I get the message,

  8K byte-wide RAM 5:3 Rx:Tx split, 100baseTX interface.
  Enabling bus-master transmits and whole-frame receives.
it is also the same messages listed on bootup.
motherboard info,

Sometimes on the bad card it will show overruns and errors in ifconfig eth0

          TX packets:2670437 errors:6 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
I think most of the time it does not.
I have also seen this in dmesg, but most of the time I do not see this
message either,
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out

eth0: Resetting the Tx ring pointer.
Any suggestions?  I'll test patches and help if I can.  This bug is driving
me crazy.
I've tried playing with the bios settings without any luck.  I think it has
been a problem every since I had this setup, ie motherboard, network card,
video card, I have no other systems to test this video card and network
card in.
