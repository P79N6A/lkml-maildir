Subject: [Patch 0/2] A Kernel Tracing Interface (updated)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These patches provide a kernel tracing interface called "trace".
The motivation for "trace" is to:
- Provide a simple set of tracing primitives that will utilize the high-
  performance and low-overhead of relayfs for passing traces data from
  kernel to user space.
- Provide a common user interface for managing kernel traces.
- Allow for binary as well as ascii trace data.
- Incorporate features from the systemtap runtime that are
  useful to others.
History- Versions of this code have been submitted for review under
a couple of different names.  The original submission was called UTT,
it was later re-submitted as GTSC.   Christoph Hellwig commented "The
code looks fine ...but the name is just dumb".  Following Christoph's
advice, I changed the name to simply "Trace".
This patch addresses review comments made by Christoph Hellwig and
Mathieu Desnoyers.  Changes include the addition of a mutex and
synchronization protecting trace state changes (using RCU) and the
reduction of the number of exports.
