The Jazz DMA hardware is an MMU that translates virtual DMA to physical
addresses.  It's virtual DMA address space is 16MB in size, it's page
size is 4kB.  That's a set of capabilities that nicely translates into
the DMA API.

The use of that call should simply be eleminated entirely.  DMA API
functions such as dma_alloc_coherent or dma_map_single will return a
dma_handle which along with the virtual address returned is everything
ever needed to program a DMA engine.
