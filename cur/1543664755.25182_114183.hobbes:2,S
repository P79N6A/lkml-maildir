In my bunch of PCMCIA/Cardbus/PCI changes, I have one patch which
decouples CONFIG_ISA from the PCMCIA subsystem, replacing it with
CONFIG_PCMCIA_PROBE - on statically mapped PCMCIA systems (eg, SA1110)
all the region probing, resource handling, and interrupt stuff is
rather heavy weight.  However, decoupling it from CONFIG_ISA would
allow all that supporting code to remain when required for some socket
drivers.
I'm working through getting stuff tested and in to Linus in a reasonable
way.  Of course, this won't help for 2.4 based kernels, although the
CONFIG_PCMCIA_PROBE has existed in the ARM tree for a fair while and
could, given someone with enough motivation, the relevant changes could
be dug out and submitted to Marcello.
