The last working kernel I had under my X windows system was 2.5.67-bk7.  After
that point every 2.5.6[8-9] and bk patch has had one major problem on my
laptop - when I bring up a gnome-terminal or xterm the console prompt never
shows up.  The terminals just hang with a blinking cursor but I never get
a prompt.  If I reboot with the same setup into my 2.5.67 or any previous
kernel then everything works fine.
This is a Debian Sid system running gnome2.  Any ideas?
