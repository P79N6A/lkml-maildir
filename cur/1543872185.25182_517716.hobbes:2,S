Not sure, whether the testcase is correct or not. See below

The problem is that the original API is based on relative time and
therefor can not be changed. 
sem_wait returns -EINTR to the application when it is interrupted, while
pthread_mutex_lock does not.

We need to create a seperate op for the futex - just like the pi_futex
and use absolute time there too.
