I am seeing the same message "kernel BUG at sched.c:944" on 2.5.34-curr
on my Toshiba laptop. It only appears when preempt is set. Without
preempt the problem does not occur. I do not have CONFIG_TOSHIBA set.
It appears before probing for IDE devices: I had to turn off the vga
framebuffer in order to see the traceback.
I cannot capture it on serial port since my laptop has none.
