Subject: [PATCH 0/2] percpu: Optimize percpu accesses v3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is the generic (non-x86) changes for zero-based per cpu variables.
This patchset provides the following:
  * Init: Move setup of nr_cpu_ids to as early as possible for usage
    by early boot functions.
  * Generic: Percpu infrastructure to rebase the per cpu area to zero
    This provides for the capability of accessing the percpu variables
    using a local register instead of having to go through a table
    on node 0 to find this cpu specific offsets.  It also would allow
    atomic operations on percpu variables to reduce required locking.
  * Introduces a new DEFINE_PER_CPU_FIRST to locate a percpu variable
    (cpu_pda in this case) at the beginning of the percpu .data section.
