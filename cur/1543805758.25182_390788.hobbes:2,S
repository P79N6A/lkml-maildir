I disagree with the "unless". Just disable it, period. Most of the time,
disabling "USB Legacy Support" leaves the bootloader fully operational.
I always recommend it as the first course of action in cases like this one.
This setting was used to set two things:
 - INT 11h delivering characters to the bootloader
 - Emulation of port 0x60
However, most decent BIOS vendors figured that the first was bogus.
They only use this setting to disable the port emulation.
BTW, the BIOS often has its finger in the bus sharing between EHCI and
its companion, there's never anything we can do about it. It is always
a BIOS update that fixes it. But it sure produces lots of false
regressions when our previous mode of operation worked by accident.
