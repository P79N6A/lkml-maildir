IFF_BROADCAST is bit number 1 (that is 0x2). So in this case it indicates
that the broadcast bit is not set before and not set after. But why do I
see BROADCAST listed when i do "ifconfig eth1" then. This bit should be
set.
Right now I'm a bit confused. There is something strange going on here
that I don't understand.
