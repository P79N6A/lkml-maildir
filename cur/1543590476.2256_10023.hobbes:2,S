When you write "the kernel", do you mean the driver or generic
code? I hope you mean the driver, because I have this:
1. the device looks normal at power on
2. the driver pokes a device-specific config register
3. the config space header changes from type 0 to type 1
(The class code does NOT indicate PCI-to-PCI bridge.
You could say this is like CardBus but much weirder)
If the kernel saves type 1 header data, cuts power using
motherboard features, restores power, and then tries to
restore type 1 header data into a type 0 header... the
system will be well and truly screwed IMHO.
