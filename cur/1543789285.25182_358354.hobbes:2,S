The present line is correct. In 'debian/control' the line reads
(word-wrapped here):
Build-Depends-Indep: libz-dev, libssl-dev,
 libcurl3-dev|libcurl3-gnutls-dev|libcurl3-openssl-dev, asciidoc (>=
 6.0.3), xmlto, debhelper (>= 4.0.0), bc
So it works correct on 'stable' versions ('libcurl3-dev') and
latest 'unstable' as well, where you have the choice of either
'libcurl3-gnutls-dev' or 'libcurl3-openssl-dev'.
