Things I found out so far:
 - delivery of this IPI under QEMU somehow doesn't work
   (I would dare to say: at emulation level. But I'm not sure yet.)
 - the breakdown of my Xeon box with kdbg is a separate issue
 - stuffing my Xeon kernel into QEMU triggers the original bug there
   too, even under UP => debugging with QEMU should be feasible
But I'm first trying to identify the related config switch that makes it
pop up, because this mostly means compiling and quick testing (I can't
spent my full time on it yet). Will let you know about news, and I would
appreciate to hear from you if you have any updates.
