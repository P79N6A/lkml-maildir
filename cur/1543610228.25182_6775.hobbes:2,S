*shrug* As we don't do any setting of this string, all I can guess
at is that the new seqfile based /proc/cpuinfo code is stricter
about getting the info from the right CPU than the older code was.
Though I'm not sure why, as the older code just read from the
per-CPU structs anyway.  Most odd.

Dave.
