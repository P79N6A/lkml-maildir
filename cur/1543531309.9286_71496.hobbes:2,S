 I think
>you can find the information that you want.
This is full of great information.  I found the copy_to/from_user
especially helpful.   Is there a place to get yet even more information?
The driver I'm porting is a network driver that registers itself as a
firewall.  It does a lot of manipulation of sk_buff's and those have
changed quite a bit between 2.0 and 2.2.  Where can I get more information
on the details of those changes and how to deal with them?  Also, amoung
other structures, I'm coming up against changes to struct device and struct
rtable.  I can list specific questions in here, but I thought it might be
less impact on linux-kernel if I tried looking for another resource first.
Thanks.
