It does not do compression yet although it would be simple to add it.
Probably we'll add it in the 2.0 branch in parallel with the 2.4 version
getting mature.
One thing that bugs me is that there seem to be a case of copy/paste in
the kernel wrt compression code :) (there are more than one instance of
inflate.c in the tree at least)
If we add it to JFFS there will at least be a deflate.c somewhere but the
inflation can probably share code with cramfs which does the same thing as
JFFS read-path will do in the compressed scenario.

Heh...
Couldn't they run cramfs for all the read-only stuff and just use the
current JFFS for configuration/params ? 
JFFS is not very optimal for thousands of files etc yet because it needs
to keep the metadata in-core (there are no checkpoints in the log with
node pointers) (like a permanent dentry cache)
