I did a "sleep 5", killed it with ^\ (SIGQUIT), ldd'ed the core as a
non-root, and it didn't reboot right away, but it did print an error message
about a bad pmd directory entry. I will do it again and write down the full
error message, if I can. I can provide the core file and .config if necessary,
as soon as the box in question is done fscking :)
