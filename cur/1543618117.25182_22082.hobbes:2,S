It is said that the crashes cease when the `nopentium' option
is used, so it does appear that something is up.
I does seem that the nVidia driver is usually involved.

-rmap is still young.  I did some heavy stress testing on it a couple
of days ago and it was rock-solid, and performed well.

Yup.  But don't forget about the `nopentium' observations.
