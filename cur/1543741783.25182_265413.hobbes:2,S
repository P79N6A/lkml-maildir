I don't know for sure if I'm having a problem or not Linus, but I had 
to dl fc3rc1's iso's several times to get all good md5sums.  
Something was fscking things using mozilla-1.7.3...  So I wrote a 
script to use wget for FC3rc2 & we'll see if that works in a few 
hours when its all here.  On a slow (768/128) DSL, and trying to 
squeeze an extra character for email in from time to time.
