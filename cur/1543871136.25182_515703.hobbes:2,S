Hey Andrew, I think you just fell victim to an order-of-operations  
bug;  '&' has a higher priority than '|' does, so:
   if ( (foo->flags & (1<<bar)) | (1<<zot))
Or:
   if ( dynamic_value | always_true_constant )
And as such this if statement is always true.  You'd need an extra  
pair of parentheses to make it correct.
Cheers,
