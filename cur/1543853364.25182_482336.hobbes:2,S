I tried that patch, but the last message I see over netconsole (using tg3) is:
Suspending console(s)
and then nothing. Nothing on resume at all :(
Adding some printks in the radeonfb_pci_suspend and radeonfb_pci_resume 
(radeon_pm.c) didn't help: I don't see them. But I am not a kernel programmer 
at all, so I might do something wrong or in the wrong place.
