Well that fixed things and didn't blow up my vfat partitions. :)
Hassle:
1025.root@kinder:/mars/red/amiga>> mv 2/zip/dl/NSDPatch43_15.lha amiga
mv: cannot move `2/zip/dl/NSDPatch43_15.lha' to `amiga/NSDPatch43_15.lha': No such file or directory
1026.root@kinder:/mars/red/amiga>> ll 2/zip/dl/NSDPatch43_15.lha amiga/
  28 -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root        28036 Nov 30 16:52 2/zip/dl/NSDPatch43_15.lha
amiga/:
total 8
   4 drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root         4096 Jan 22 00:15 .
   4 drwxr-xr-x   7 root     root         4096 Jan 22 00:15 ..
As far as I can understand things, the move SHOULD have worked, no?
btw, I did go to win98 (may my HD forgive me.. such thrashing at bootup)
and ran scandisk ont he partition and it fixed the errors that were
present. one of the problems were that the drive was being incorrectly
reported as full (both vfat partitions got fubared in this way). scan disk
fixed this.
