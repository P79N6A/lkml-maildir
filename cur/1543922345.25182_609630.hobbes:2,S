this sort of problem is possible with just a single LSM.
remember that unix doesn't try to make it impossible for the system owner 
to hang himself, becouse there are many other cases where the rope is used 
productivly. don't let the possibility that things can be done wrong 
prevent other people from being creative in ways that you never thought 
of.
