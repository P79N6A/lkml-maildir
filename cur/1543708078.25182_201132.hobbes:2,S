There are several websites with information.
I once collected #! info.
See 
http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/std/hashexclam-1.html
 .. argi, consists of the 0 or 1 or perhaps more arguments to
 the interpreter found in the #! line. Thus, this group is empty
 if there is no nonblank text following the interpreter name in
 the #! line. If there is such nonblank text then for SysVR4,
 SunOS, Solaris, IRIX, HPUX, AIX, Unixware, Linux, OpenBSD, Tru64
 this group consists of precisely one argument.
 FreeBSD, BSD/OS, BSDI split the text following the interpreter name
 into zero or more arguments.
