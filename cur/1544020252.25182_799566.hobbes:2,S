Well, software-based ECC for s2ram (calculate right before s2ram,
check-and-fix right after waking up) is certainly doable and a LOT
easier than my crazy idea of sofware-based generic ECC (which requires
some sort of trick to detect pages that were written to, so that you
can update their ECC information)...
