Two (not quite exclusive ;) ..) points:
First, most pda's have apps like telnet/ssh/etc available. (And even more
specific apps are available for various uses - I recall a palm pilot app
that talked to cisco gear and gave a nice gui for 90% of the config, plus
a terminal for the rest.)
And second, I agree that there are some great advantages to small linux
(my ipaq runs linux, and my barely larger libretto is a full debian
mirror) but all of these (even pocketlinux, which is basically not linux)
work with the concept of multiple users.  Whether for profiles or for
system vs user, they all use it.  This patch is trash.
