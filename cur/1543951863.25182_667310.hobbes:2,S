The three resumes took place on March 12 at 05:21:02, 06:00:28, and 
19:20:08 (it's not always clear in the log what time the suspends took 
place).  The timestamp on the disconnect message is 19:20:09.37743.  In 
the next line the device was rediscovered.

Testing has to come before fixing -- you can't fix the problem if you
don't know which component is at fault.  For all we know, the hardware
could be fine and the problem could lie in your application.
All I can think of for testing is to use usbmon to record the data 
transfers when those -110 errors come up.
