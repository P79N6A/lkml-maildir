I got a similiar message 
Dec  4 19:59:57 nightmaster kernel: VM: Removing swap cache page with wrong inode hash on page c41dd000
along with an netscape-communicator uninteruptible sleeping
inside "down_failed".
And I got these sort of messages since upgrading to 2.2.13 (but
applied R.Goochs low-latency-2.2.13-A1 patch).
cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.2.13 (root@nightmaster.csn.tu-chemnitz.de) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #2 Tue Nov 30 17:11:50 CET 1999
Any ideas?
I still have this netscape process hanging around, so we can
debug it easily. But normal gdb couldn't attach to it :(
