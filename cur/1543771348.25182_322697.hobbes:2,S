This reminds me that page migration defrag will be pretty useless 
without something like this done first.  There will be stuff that can't 
be migrated and it needs to be grouped together somehow.
In summary here are the reasons I see to run with Mel's patch:
1. It really helps with medium-large allocations under memory pressure.
2. Page migration defrag will need it.
3. Memory hotplug remove will need it.
On the downside we have:
1. Slightly more complexity in the allocator.
I'd personally trade a little extra complexity for any of the 3 upsides.
