I provided you with the demonstration last week:
- the non SMP (ARM version < 6) is using xchg.
- xchg on ARM version < 6 is always faster and smaller than any 
  preemption disable.
- xchg on ARM is the same size as the smallest solution you may think of
  when preemption is disabled and never slower (prove me otherwise? if 
  you wish).
- all xchg based primitives are "generic" code already.
And I think you didn't look at the overall patch set before talking 
about "lots of ugliness", did you?  The fact is that the code, 
especially the core code, is much cleaner now than it was when 
everything was seemingly "generic" since the current work on 
architecture abstractions still allows optimizations in a way that is so 
much cleaner and controlled than what happened with the semaphore code, 
and the debugging code can even take advantage of it without polluting 
the core code.
It happens that i386, x86_64 and ARM (if v6 or above) currently have 
their own tweaks to save space and/or cycles in a pretty strictly 
defined way.  The effort is currently spent on making sure if other 
architectures want to use one of their own tricks for those they can do 
it without affecting the core code which remains 95% of the whole thing 
(which is not the case for semaphores), and the currently provided 
architecture specific versions are _never_ bigger nor slower than any 
generic version would be.  Otherwise what would be the point?
