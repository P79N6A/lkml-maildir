This is a minor update to the previous version with more architecture ports.
Any testing appreciated (especially on the untested architectures)
status:
i386 and x86-64 tested in previous version
ia64            tested and works
PPC64, PPC32, Alpha compile now, but are untested.
Porting a new architecture to it is quite straight forward, please see the i386
changes.  Any patches to support new architectures would be appreciated.
