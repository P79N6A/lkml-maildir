So how would you tell the difference between the following?
	device = "foobar0"
	id = -1
	path = "/sys/devices/platform/foobar0"
versus
	device = "foobar"
	id = 0
	path = "/sys/devices/platform/foobar0"
I'll agree that having two drivers named like this is bad, but how is a
userspace application given a path like "/sys/devices/platform/foobar0"
supposed to figure out which one it is.  It's not as nice to add the
extra period, but otherwise you end up with a lot of _extra_ special
cases in both the kernel _and_ applications, which helps nobody.
