I don't know, I haven't digested the class interface patches yet, since

Nothing prevents users from doing it the callback way.  However,
callbacks aren't a scaleable interface for properties that have to be
shared and overridden.
I agree string compares are unwieldy (and smack of XML), so I'm open to
suggestions of a better way of doing it that has the same flexibility of
the string method...
