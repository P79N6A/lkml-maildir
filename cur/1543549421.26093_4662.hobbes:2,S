Hi Daniel,
> tar -cvf /dev/f1 .
Take a look at the line before it:
	tar:
		tar -cvf /dev/f1 .
This goal has been in the net/*/Makefile files a very long time.  I see
it in linux-0.99.1.tar!
My guess is that the original author/user of this little goal liked to
back up their work to floppy disk every so often (think about it, they
didn't have mature networking in place, so a floppy backup makes a lot
of sense).  I'll also guess that the original author/user is no longer
backing up onto floppies, and no one would mind if someone removed this
historic relic.
But it's not a 2.4 critical bug so no action for a while.
Michael
