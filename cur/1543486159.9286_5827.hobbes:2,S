No, if the shaper->timer has some chance to be pending (and if it had no
chance to be pending also del_timer() would be an overkill).

The race is very more fun ;). The race is that you may have the
shaper->timer running on the other CPU while you are deleting it. Yes, the
timerlist is preserved from corruption, but you may remove the vmalloced
module code while the shaper->timer is running.

shaper_kick() now uses mod_timer() (now I can use mod_timer() because I
rewrote the locking scheme) to be sure that the shaper->timer will not
added two times causing the timer_bh() to loop forever.

No. The timer list has nothing to do this time with the bh_atomic(). The 
bh_atomic will assure us that once we are in line xxxxxxxxxxx: 
    start_bh_atomic();
    del_timer(&shaper->timer);
    end_bh_atomic();
    xxxxxxxxxxxx
we won't have the shaper->timer pending or _running_ anymore.
