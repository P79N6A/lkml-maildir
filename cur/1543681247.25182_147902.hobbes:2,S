I jave a device driver which was originaly created for a Kernel 2.4.18-3. It
has an mmap method which uses a call to remap_page_range. In this call, I
pass the in the logical start address, the physical address, the size and
protection mappings. I have upgraded the Kernel to a 2.4.20-8 and now my
remap_page_range call does not compile. It requires me to pass the vma
structure as a first parameter. What changed? Whys is this necessary?
Please CC me directly on any responses.
Thanks in advance,
