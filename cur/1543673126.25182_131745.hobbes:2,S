Hi!
My "make menuconfig" - Session on Kernel Mandrake 2.4.21-0.1mdkcustom failed 
when selecting "Advanced Linux Sound Architecture" within the "Sound" - Menu.
The exact error message:
------------------------------------ message -------------------------------
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu74: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Fehler 1
------------------------------------ message -------------------------------
Thanks for fixing :)
