Subject: Equivalent of 'insmod -m' on 2.6?

Hi,
I am trying to debug a module on 2.6.0-test3 with
module-init-tools-0.9.12. But I am not able to get
the load map of the module being loaded. 'insmod'
in module-init-tools does not support the '-m' option. 
While working on 2.4, the load map given by 'insmod -m'
was very useful for debugging modules. Is there an
equivalent for 2.5/2.6 kernels?
Even the new 'struct module' does not seem to contain
all the section and relocation information. 
Please CC me on the replies since I am not subscribed
to the list.
Thanks in advance for any help.
-Ravi.
