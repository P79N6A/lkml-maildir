So what is the best solution?
If it is a pointer, you can store other device info besides major/minor
in the struct, eliminating the need to scan arrays of such information
indexed by major/minor.
IMHO, if kdev_t is unsigned long, you get larger major/minors on 32-bit
and 64-bit platforms, while still only carrying around a "machine int".
