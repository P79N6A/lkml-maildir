The uptime really does need to increase during suspend. Otherwise,
things get really weird with devices like the OLPC XO which will be
sleeping between keystrokes. You could run the device for hours,
yet get an uptime of only a few minutes. Suspended time should get
counted as stolen time, same as when a hypervisor takes away time.
