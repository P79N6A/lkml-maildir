I think that n should be a function of the number of accepted patches
that this person sent in before, and the number of regressions he
caused in the past.
Ie, new developers have to wait a considerable amount of time - while
experienced developers who never caused a regression should be able
to write patches that are immediately applied. Also, if anyone causes
a regression - that would lead to them having to wait longer the
next time before they can apply the patch - a good reason for a
developer to put extra time into making sure there are no regressions.
