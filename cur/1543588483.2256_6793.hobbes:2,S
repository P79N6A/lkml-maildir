The right way to handle that is to have a report generator that does the
grep for you, or if you like simply returns the concatenation of all the
map blocks so you can grep that.
The point of distributing them is so they're close to the work units they
describe, and are thus (a) easy to find, and (b) more likely to stay up to
date.
