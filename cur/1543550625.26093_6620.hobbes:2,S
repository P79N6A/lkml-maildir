[Fix your mail program to put in carriage returns at 72 columns, please]
I hate it because it compiles much more slowly than 2.72 and for
my purposes, at least, the resulting code is not any faster on
any of the following platforms: x86, SPARC, MIPS, PA-RISC, and Alpha.
I ran a bunch of tests with both on the BitKeeper source base, about
100K lines of code or so, and then ran the regressions as well as some
hand picked tests.  No faster.  Just compiles slower.  Add to that 
some distributions BRAINDEAD default of havving colorgcc be the default
compiler (can you say fork perl to fork gcc?  Can you say STUPID?), and
you start to understand why the first thing I do is remove all that 
garbage and put back a reasonable compiler.
I'm not impressed.
