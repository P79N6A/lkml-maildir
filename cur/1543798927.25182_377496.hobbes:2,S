Kindly also CC this to linux-kernel as well so that you have more
chances to get the solution of your problem.
It seems to me that you may have missed SIG_PENDING at the time when
you setup your thread. You will have to signal your thread to kill it.
Just setting up TASK STATE is not enough untill the process gets
scheduled or it gets the signal to kill itself explicitly
