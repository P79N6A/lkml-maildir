You can do that with CML1 or his code. The problem is that you need to
go back through checking with the user because
-	Some requirements are going to suprise and may stop other
	settings
	(Simple example  "I want GMX2000 support" -> requires DRM 4.0
	DRM 4.0 requires they turn off some DRM 4.1 stuff they selected
-	Some have alternate solutions
But you can deduce what to ask the user
-
To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in
the body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.org
