Both need access to timezone rules ;)

So what?? Do you tell me that linux should fix windows bugs? Or that linux
should be able to magically able to detect that the time chenged while it
was not running???

Good. How about a syscall that would say, in effect: "on the next minute
change, update the tzoffset".

If done at regular intervals, yes. And since you then need something in
userspace you do not need a syscall.

But this can already be done in userspace... why put it into the kernel???
This is my last post in this thread.
