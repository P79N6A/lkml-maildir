The first to define a symbol makes the rule. How do you claim that
"CONFIG_SMP" is any more `proper` than "__SMP__" ?
If I changed the word automobile because I thought it was a misnomer
since there is, provably, nothing "auto" about it, do you think the
world would follow?

A new rule? You say; "external modules built for SMP kernels should
already define CONFIG_SMP". Since when? 
The only place CONFIG_SMP is defined is in the auto-generated
header file. It is not as you say, used by some files under
the linux/include directory. It's not used by any files up to version
2.3.36 in that directory.

# grep CONFIG_SMP /usr/include/linux/*.h
/usr/include/linux/autoconf.h:#define CONFIG_SMP 1
# exit

...and it is used once in linux/asm as:
Script started on Wed Jan 12 13:22:23 2000
# grep CONFIG_SMP /usr/include/asm/*.h
/usr/include/asm/bugs.h:#if defined(CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC) && defined(CONFIG_SMP)
# exit
exit
Script done on Wed Jan 12 13:23:12 2000
So it looks as though there is a bug in /usr/include/asm/bugs.h. It should
read:
#if defined(CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC) && defined(__SMP__)
Then you can get rid of the unused generated CONFIG_SMP entirely.
Cheers,
