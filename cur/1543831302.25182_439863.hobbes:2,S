Hi,
A while ago, I reported a suspend to RAM regression (fail to resume). I
have since then tracked down the regression to the changes between
2.6.12-rc5-git5 and 2.6.12-rc5-git6. On my laptop, I have only been able
to reproduce the problem with the ondemand cpufreq governor, but I've
head of another user with the same (Dell D600) laptop having problem
with the userspace governor as well. All the details are actually
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6166
 but it seems like it's
being ignored. It's currently assigned to the ACPI category, but maybe
it belongs to cpufreq? Anyone can help here?
