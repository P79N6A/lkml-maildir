gcc did have some support to pass condition codes into assembly.
On ARM, you used to be able to do things like:
	if (foo)
		asm("blah%?	whatever");
and gcc would replace %? with whatever condition was appropriate
for the current block of code.  You can still write it as the
above.
However, this optimisation was disabled on ARM apparantly because
it was very hard to for people to get correct - if you forgot the
%?, you need to add a "cc" clobber, and if you forget that as well
you might get unconditional behaviour.
