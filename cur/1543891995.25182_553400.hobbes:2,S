This is an utterly ridiculous argument.  You are subscribed to LKML,
with a message size limit of 400K.  "replies to rmk" are clearly lost
in the noise compared to the rest of the list traffic.

So by fiat, you decide that gives you the right to override OTHER
PEOPLE'S personal preferences?  Why are you so much more important
to a thread than everyone else?
If you are unwilling to fix the problem and work within existing
community email standards, I think it would be fair to ask vger
postmaster to start excising Mail-Followup-To headers.
You are NOT more important that everyone else.
Stop hijacking EVERYONE ELSE's email preferences.
