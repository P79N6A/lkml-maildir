Here are some suggestions for coding style cleanups:
  - Use Lindet for initial formatting
  - Kill use of LINUX_VERSION_CODE macro for compatability
  - Kill obfuscating macros. For example, IPG_DEV_KFREE_SKB and 
    IPG_DEVICE_TYPE.
  - Move changelogs outside of source files
  - Convert kmalloc/memset to kzalloc and kcalloc
  - Remove redundant typecasts
  - Remove dead code
  - Use dev_{dbg,err,info,warn} for logging
  - Remove unnecessary curly braces
  - Use proper naming convention for things like Length and pPHYParam
  - Convert macro functions to static inline functions for type safety
				Pekka
