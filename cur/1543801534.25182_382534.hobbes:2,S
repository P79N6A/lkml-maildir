Color me skeptical, but nonetheless, it looks to me like the mechanism 
might need the attached.
On the subject of nip and tuck, take a look at the little proggy posted in 
thread [SCHED] wrong priority calc - SIMPLE test case.  That testcase was 
the result of Paolo Ornati looking into a real problem on his system.  I 
just 'fixed' that nanosleep() problem by judicious application of 
TASK_NONINTERACTIVE to the schedule_timeout().  Sure, it works, but it 
doesn't look like anything but a bandaid (tourniquet in this case:) to me.
