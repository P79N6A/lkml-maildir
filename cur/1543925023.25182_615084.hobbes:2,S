I think this is close, but it looks like you missed the syscall classification 
piece. You can find an example here:
arch/x86_64/kernel/audit.c
Its used for determining which syscalls we are interested in for watches. 
Also, IBM and HP both have released audit test suites. You should run the CAPP 
tests at a minimum to see if you have hooked everything that is expected. If 
you have SE Linux enabled for that platform, you may want to try the LSPP 
tests but you would need have the MLS policy installed.
IBM's announcement is here:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/redhat-lspp/2007-August/msg00002.html
and HP's here:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-audit/2007-August/msg00030.html
And...user space would need an update for the syscall table and arches so that 
you can run the tests. Please send that patch to linux-audit mail list.
Thanks,
