For some reason, when I exports a directory structure such a the root
directory, /, any filesystems which have their own partition, such as
/usr, /home, etc. etc. are denied by the nfs server even though directory
structure directly on / are fine.
fh_verify: //home permission failure, acc=4, error=16777216 
fh_verify: //usr permission failure, acc=4, error=16777216 
fh_verify: //home permission failure, acc=4, error=16777216 
fh_verify: //home permission failure, acc=4, error=16777216 
fh_verify: //home permission failure, acc=4, error=16777216
Is there an option to mount, or exports that I'm not used to
with knfs?
Sorry if this is a simple questions or not for the list.  Didn't
know where else to turn.
Thanks
