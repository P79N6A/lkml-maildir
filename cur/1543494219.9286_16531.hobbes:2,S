It's not necessarily 100% fixed, but at least we couldn't find any more
broken places.  The newer kernels have a good set of time comparison
routines which avoid the wrap problems entirely.

It depends on the clock rate, but there are other issues: increasing HZ
too much adds a lot of overhead to the kernel, as you end up taking more
frequent scheduling interrupts --- which costs CPU time --- and
rescheduling processes more often --- which costs memory bandwidth as
you refill the TLB and memory caches.
As far as hardware is concerned, the figure of 800KHz sticks in my
memory as the maximum granularity of the timer used for the scheduler,
but I could well be wrong there.

Not really, because the exact cost of each tick depends so much on just
what the workload is.

The maximum interval the kernel can delay for is 2^31/HZ seconds, not
2^32, because we need to distinguish between past and future.  However,
device and networking drivers only use jiffies for relatively short-term
timeouts: the longer-term timeouts are all measured in seconds
(sometimes allowing fractional seconds too, as in the struct timeval),
so they won't time out for a few years yet.  (But we still have problems
in the year 2038.)
