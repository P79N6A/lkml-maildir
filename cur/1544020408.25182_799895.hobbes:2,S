Scanning the full memory may take a lot of time, depending on the
amount of RAM and the number of objects allocated. It is not unlikely
to take more than 120 seconds on some loaded systems. However, it
should call schedule() periodically to let other tasks run. Is your
system unresponsive during this?

It looks like the kmemleak thread is in the TASK_UNINTERUPTIBLE state.
This happens when it calls schedule_timeout_uninterruptible() to sleep
between scans. It probably took more than 120 to scan the memory and
hence the report.
It doesn't look like a problem, only that the watchdog thread checks
for uninterruptible tasks. I can try to make it sleep with
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE to avoid the message.
Thanks.
