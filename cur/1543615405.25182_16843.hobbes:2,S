Sorry but if the patch of mine gets accepted there is a notifier hook that
first flushes_cache and holds for the return, then spins down the disks.
The cache_flushes are called always in addition if you were to look
closely at the new driver, each time you unmount a partition the disk is
flushed.  Overkill sure, but you will always have at least one flush cache
on a drive that has never been mounted.  You will have a min of 3 flush
cache calls on a drive which is mounted.
1 for each partition mounted.
1 of dec the usage counter to 0.
1 for deregistering the device.
