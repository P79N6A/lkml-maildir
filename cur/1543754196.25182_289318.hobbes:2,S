Applause!  This is IMO overdue, but maybe sensor systems don't need it
as much as other I2C applications do.  For example, see the isp1301_omap
driver, which could have been hugely simpler if there were an async I2C
framework to build on.  That's probably one of the more complex examples
floating around ... but it's hardly the only place where needing to talk
synchronously to I2C chips creates trouble.

It'd have to have a queue, so that several different chips could have
operations pending concurrently.  I suspect you wouldn't need to cancel
operations once they're queued ... useful simplification, compared to
for example USB.  (Which in retrospect needs a "kill queue" operation,
per endpoint, rather than the "cancel request" operation we've got.
But when 2.2 started with USB, we didn't quite know that ... ;)

To the extent I've thought about it, that sounds like a good approach.
