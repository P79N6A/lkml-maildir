Well, then, those symbols will stop being dead.  But note this: *none of
those MTD symbols are set*.  So the effect of losing these would not be
to lose any CML1 information, merely to make a few more questions visible
during make oldconfig.  This is a feature, not a bug.

They are helping create a dense thicket in which real bugs can hide.
The cross-referencer has already turned up several genuine errors, 
and will doubtless turn up more -- but if the reports are stuffed
full of meaningless crap about undead defconfig symbols that aren't 
even set, the genuine errors are going to be hard to notice.
