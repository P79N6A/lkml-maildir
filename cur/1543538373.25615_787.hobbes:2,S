[FSCK-ing a live filesystem]

If "as an intelligent being" I want to check a live filesystem, I just
run fsck (yes, with the -n option), and then wait for the errors to
come in. Usually it's just a few. 
Then there are just a few files/directories/blocks to reexamine. And
the "errors" can usually be easily traced. Say "/var/log/messages"
just grew a block larger.
Now if this approach still works on a busy mail server, is beyond me.
