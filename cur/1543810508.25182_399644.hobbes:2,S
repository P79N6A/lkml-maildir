I've seen the same thing (on Athlon 64x2 64 bit)
but was not sure if it was a problem.
The break point for me seems to be between -j 2 and -j 3
-j 2 = serialized (or the appearance of)
-j 3 = both cores mostly busy
I'm pretty sure with an earlier 2.6 kernel source (but same environment)
I did not see this. I'll start back tracking to earlier kernels
to see if I can identify when this started.
