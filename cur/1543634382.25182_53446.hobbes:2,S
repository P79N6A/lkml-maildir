Done, checked into ext3 cvs (features-branch again.)
Deleting and recreating 100,000 files with this kernel:
[root@spock test0]# time xargs rm -f < /root/flist.100000 
real    0m14.305s
user    0m0.750s
sys     0m5.430s
[root@spock test0]# time xargs touch < /root/flist.100000 
real    0m16.244s
user    0m0.530s
sys     0m6.660s
that's an average of 160usec per create, 140usec per delete elapsed
time, and 66/54usec respectively system time.  
I assume the elapsed time is greater only because we're starting to
wrap the journal due to the large amount of metadata being touched
(we're touching a lot of inodes doing the above, which I could avoid
by making hard links instead of new files.)  Certainly, limiting the
test to 10,000 files lets it run at 100% cpu.
