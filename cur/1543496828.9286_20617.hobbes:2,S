Returning -EPERM and sending SIGCAP (non-fatal signal) has the
disadvantage that the program cannot tell at the time the syscall returns
what has happened, because signals are asynchronous.
I see three options:
return -ECAP: disadvantage: Non-aware apps wouldn't know about this error
and assume wild things (or even break). advantage: Aware apps could know
what happened without too much overhead.
return -EACCES: advantage: Old apps know what happened. Disadvantage: New
apps are unsure.
send SIGCAP: advantage: ? disadvantage: Causes strange things if not
properly caught.
