OK.  But some (most) of them will sleep, too.  And we shouldn't sleep in a
dead kernel.

Don't we?  The 16M of memory was allocated up-front at kexec load time[*],
so nobody will be pointing DMA hardware at it.  And the dump kernel won't
be pointing DMA hardware at the crashed kernel's pages.

Well.  There aren't any.

A significant proportion of kernel crashes happen from [soft]irq context,
from which we cannot call shutdown methods.  So we need to be able to bring
up the dump kernel without having run driver shutdown functions anwyay..
[*] At least, I _assume_ the 16MB will be prereserved,
    physically-contiguous and wholly within ZONE_NORMAL.  Is this wrong?
