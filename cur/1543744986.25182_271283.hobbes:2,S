Note that if you didn't want to have this rash of balancing attempted after
a CPU wasn't able to run the rebalance for a long time, the solution would
be to keep adding the balance interval until it becomes greater than the
current jiffies.
I actually prefer it to try to make up the lost balances, just from the
perspective of gathering scheduler statistics. I don't suspect it happens
enough to justify adding the extra logic - Darren, are you actually seeing
problems?
