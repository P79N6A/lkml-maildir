Hello
Just pointing out that my system has locked hard in XWindows system.
Sorry no-oops as linux so far is unable to switch to VGA mode in this
case
and show me this log.
I'd not seen any oops with 2.4.5-pre1 during the whole usage of this
kernel
on my SMP box BP6.
-pre3 has locked after 5 hours - and I've been working with this machine
only for the last hour.
I could only describe situation: - starting multithread application
which has been loading data across nfs.
Thats all I can say ... switching back to -pre1
(BTW Core is still no being generated for threaded apps in -pre3 -
please fix)
bye
kabi
