(1) and (2) are things we can support in the VFS layer.  (3) is
filesystem specific and, as such, is beyond the scope of this 
discussion, IMHO.  We are attempting to find a way of supporting
EA/NS in Linux itself so that the NTFS/HFS/BeFS functionality can
be fully supported in an independent manner.

Linus suggested something like this with some trivial name changes.
This is, I thin, pretty close to what we're going to need when all 
is said and done.  This would allow a number of FS implementations to
work with the Linux kernel.

Part of the point of NS/EA is to allow programs that don't care about
them to use the files as they normally would, while allowing programs
that do know about them to exploit the extra functionality.  As such,
making existing tools automagically work is probably not possible.
As Linus mentioned, tar can be extended.  I'd go so far as to claim
the same for cp, mv, cpio, etc.
A Good Solution would, however, minimize the amount of extension
needed.

Building a clean, FS-independent interface is, IMHO, the way to go.
