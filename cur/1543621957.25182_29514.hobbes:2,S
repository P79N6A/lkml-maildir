A friend of mine had exactly the same problems. These were eventually
solved by buying a new CDR drive.
We tried running the "cdrecord" from the old installation: Same problem. 
We tried it on the remainder of the spindle that used to work with the old
installation: Same problem. 
We tried it with the CDR discs that I use here: Same problem. 
(I was suspecting a problem with the disks as "start of lead in:
97:23:00" sounded a bit odd to me, and would result in "logical block
address out of range", So I first suspected the discs to be
incompatible with the current cdrecord.)

His old installation won't boot anymore, so in that case we can't
easily try anymore... Grmbl.

Ehmm. My story is about a real SCSI CDR drive. He now has an IDE drive.
