page_mkwrite() is called before any of the PTEs referring to a page are made
writable.  This must precede a page being dirtied by writing to it directly
through an mmap'd section.  It does not catch write() and co. dirtying pages,
but then there's no need since prepare_write() is available for that.

See the FS-Cache patches posted to LKML on the 19th of May, in particular the
documentation included in the patch with the subject:
	[PATCH 10/14] FS-Cache: Generic filesystem caching facility [try #10]
These patches permit data retrieved from network filesystems (NFS and AFS for
now) to be cached locally on disk.
The page is fetched from the server and then written to the cache.  We don't
let the clean page be modified or released until the write to the cache is
complete.  This permits us to keep track of what state the cache is in.

But by the time set_page_dirty() is called, it's too late as the code
currently stands.  We've already marked the PTE writable and dirty.  The
page_mkwrite() op is called _first_.

You have to detect ENOSPC before you modify the PTE, otherwise someone else
can jump through your hoop and dirty the page before you can stop them.

That's bad, even if you restrict it to those that have MAP_SHARED and
PROT_WRITE set.  They should not be terminated if they haven't attempted to
write to the mapping.

Brrrr.
What's wrong with my suggestion anyway?
