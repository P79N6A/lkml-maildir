Afraid everything gets routed to the same account in the end anyway. I 
checked the logs and the problem is that your mail server has a HELO 
that differs from its IP (outmail.freedom2surf.net vs. 194.106.33.237). 
Reverse is ok, but forward points to 194.106.56.14.

I've had the same idea. But I think it will be difficult since we need 
som funky logic during init. Perhaps a model where each mode 
(MMC/SD/SDIO) each gets their turn trying to find something on the bus. 
But this would require a rather large rewrite of the MMC layer. We would 
need to separate MMC logic from the driver interface. And mmc_block and 
sd_block would more or less be the same. Considering how much is similar 
(and most people want SD support anyhow), I'm not sure that we have much 
to gain from separating them.

I need it to determine if the code should send an RCA or ask for one, 
and to determine if it should try and read the SCR. Your solution used 
an extra parameter but I thought a mode flag would be better since we 
might need to know mode later on (after init.).

No hints in the spec about why? Seems very strange since there's no 
change in what goes over the wire.
