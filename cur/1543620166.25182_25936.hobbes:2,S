It would be useful if you also did dbench tests with a much
lower amount of dbench processes.
Once you get over 'dbench 16' or so the whole thing basically
becomes an excercise in how well the system can trigger task
starvation in get_request_wait.
I can recommend 'dbench 1'  'dbench 4'  'dbench 16'   ;)
