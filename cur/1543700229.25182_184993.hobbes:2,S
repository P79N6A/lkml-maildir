Hi
Bad news (with 2.6.0)
I was writing a cd (with ide-atapi) and downloading something 
on dial-up and when i switched desks (screens) in fvwm a 
hard lockup occured (X froze, dial up link froze (the leds on
 the modem didn't blinked anymore) and i could't use alt + SysRQ
also). I had to press the reset button :-(
kernel config, dmesg and program versions attached
Bye
Calin
