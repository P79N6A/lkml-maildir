Hi
Could someone, please, fix this:
drivers/media/video/tcm825x.c:
853:	if (sensor->platform_data == NULL
854:	    && !sensor->platform_data->is_okay())
I haven't looked through the entire file, so, cannot guarantee, that this 
is the only place. Maybe, someone could review this file and the whole 
commit it came in with properly...
Thanks
Guennadi
