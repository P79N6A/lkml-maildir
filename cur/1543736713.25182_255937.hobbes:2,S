And I'm not on any linux-* list, sorry. The next time I will write to 
linux-scsi directly.

Both, at initialization time _and_ normal operation.
The 2.6.9-rc2 dmesg does list the same devices - but with 
"sym0:0:0:phase change 6-7 ..." between the devices beeing detected.
I'll rebuild the kernel with the defective scsi driver (I reverted the 
changes to get a functional system ...) when I'm back in the office in 
some hours. The 2.6.9-rc2 does contain the domain validation changes, I 
will take a look if the patch in 2.6.9-rc2 does change the version 
string if this matters.
Have fun,
