That would be my preferred method. Merge Erics and my fixup for 2.6.24-rc.
The only open questions is, what was the reiserfs problem? Is it still
causes by Erics patches?

While the merge window is still open, to me the new ramdisk code seems
more like a 2.6.25-rc thing. We actually should test the behaviour in 
low memory scenarios. What do you think?
