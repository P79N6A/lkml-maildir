Testing 2.6.15-rc3-mm1 seems to have issues on ppc64 systems using
the powerpc architecture.  The problems are in the powermac support
relating to the BOOTX_TEXT support.
Following this email are a couple of patches to clean up this build:
powerpc-powermac-adb-fix-dependancy-on-btext_drawchar: fix up a
  dependancy problem on BOOTX_TEXT
powerpc-powermac-adb-fix-udbg_adb_use_btext-warning: clean up a
  warning with unused externals
