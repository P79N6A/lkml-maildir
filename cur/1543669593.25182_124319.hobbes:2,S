Sure, it's probably not going to happen with normal usage, but say
you're using a large application, then load a web browser to read the
documentaion, and part of the large application is swapped out.  Once
the web browser has loaded, it might free some RAM, and then you spend
10 minutes reading the documentation.  The disk might spin down after
five minutes, and then have to spin back up again when you switch back
to your main application.  We could possibly avoid this by swapping
the pages back in after one minute of inactivity, then letting the
disk spin down.
Infact, we could spin down the disk _immediately_, if we find that we
can swap all of the pages back in to physical RAM.  Of course, that
would only make sense if the disk is being used primarily for swap,
but it's a scenario where we could do better than we are at the
moment.
