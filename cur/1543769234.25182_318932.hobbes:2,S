I don't understand your message very well.  The dmix plugin is part of
alsa-lib, which is part of userspace.  From the application's point of
view, it does not matter whether the mixing happens in kernel or not.
ALSA follows the philosophy of doing as little as possible in the
kernel, and since mixing and volume control work fine in userspace,
that's where they live.
