Marc Michelsen brought this up last year on <discuss@x86-64.org>
(which I suppose is the right list), but he didn't receive many
comments (not publicly, at least).

Someone from AMD told Marc that fixes in pci-gart.c (probably related
to iommu_fullflush, see the comment there) are supposed to suppress
the error in the first place.  That's why we are a bit confused
whether the errors are really harmless (our machines do run stable,
though).
It also seems that the bug is not as well-documented as it deserves to
be.  (The search engines will pick up this thread, though.)  Our
vendor told us to have the RAM tested, for instance. 8->

If the errors are really harmless, it probably makes sense to add a
warning to the mcelog output that this MCE is expected, preferably
with an AMD errata reference.
Filtering in the kernel seems to be overkill because the rate of those
spurious MCEs is fairly low, and they won't lead to loss of other,
more important MCEs.
