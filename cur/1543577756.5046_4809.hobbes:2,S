Ahh, ok.
This is actually where I agree with whoever it was that said that ramfs as
it stands now (without the limit checking etc) is much nicer simply
because it can act as an example of how to do a simple filesystem. 
I wonder what to do about this - the limits are obviously useful, as would
the "use swap-space as a backing store" thing be. At the same time I'd
really hate to lose the lean-mean-clean ramfs. 
Anyway, I'm quite sure that the resource stuff would not be 2.4.1 material
(adding the UnlockPage() is), so I won't have to worry about this issue
for a while.
