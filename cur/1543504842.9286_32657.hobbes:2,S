Not at all - one is checked after every 23 mounts, the other after
every 29 mounts, neither of which is a particularly long time. It is
the checking of BOTH filesystems AT THE SAME TIME that takes a long
time, which is as it should be.
For reference...
	/dev/hda1	= swap
	/dev/hda2	= /boot			23
	/dev/hda3	= vfat (Win98)
	/dev/hda4	= Extended
	/dev/hda5	= /			29
	/dev/hda6	= /usr			31
	/dev/hda7	= /usr/local		37
	/dev/hda8	= /tmp		(Reformatted every boot)
	/dev/hda9	= /home			41
	/dev/hda10	= /root			43
	/dev/hda11	= /usr/src		47
So, the various ext2 partitions will be checked at intervals ranging
from every 23rd mount to every 47th mount, which is hardly a problem.
Assuming daily reboots, that varies between 3 and 7 weeks between
checks.
However, two partitions being checked AT THE SAME TIME occurs at the
LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of the intervals concerned. Since each
interval is a prime number, the LCM is simply the product of the
intervals concerned...
Best wishes from Riley.
