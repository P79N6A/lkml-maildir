In case the registration fails and somebody tries to free memory:
- Driver will not remove the affected memory from the eHEA memory region
  --> Firmware (phyp) can not free that memory (as marked as used)
  --> Therefore the removed memory could not be used in an other partition
It makes sense to allow the driver to work anyway. Having no ethernet
would not really be a good alternative.
