Gérard, thank you so much for writing back to me!

I surely did.  It's all brand new equipment, terminated properly (my older
problems were due to poor termination, which is now clearly fixed (I had
severe data loss before, and frequent.  Now, things are very stable except
for this lock-up problem)).

Hmmm... do you think this could be the root cause of my problem?  Is it
worth using a spare older SCSI card of a different brand to handle the Jaz
drive separately?
FWIW, I have the Jaz on a separate chain (the card has multiple chains for
Ultra2, Ultra, and traditional SCSI-II).  Also, the Jaz is unmounted when
the problem occurs.
The LVD/Ultra2/80MBsec drive is on a chain all by itself.  One internal
cable from the card to the drive to the terminator.

I apologize, but I am not sure what you mean by this.  Can you explain
further? 
Specifically, what do you mean by 'device disconnecting the SCSI bus'.  I
have disconnections "not allowed".  Can it still happen anyway?
Also, what do you mean by "disconnect being to hard"?
Finally, what do you mean by a "not correctly set SCSI bus"?  Do you mean,
set as in the card is not seated properly?  Or, not set properly in the SCSI
BIOS parameters?

I have checked and rechecked  this a number of times.

Where do I get this?

I will do this the next time I reboot the machine.

Hmm...Interesting.  I will be sure not to do this.
