Thanks, I'd been planning to resend once I got the ddcprobe thing sorted
but I've been a bit snowed under (deadlines :-|). This patch is
independently correct though and turns the ddcprobe failure from a domU
kernel crash into a userspace hang.
ddcprobe hangs because the page at pfn 0 is comprised entirely 0xc2
bytes (the Xen memory scrub poison value -- I'm running a debug
hypervisor) which causes lrmi to try and jump to 0xc2c2*16+0xc2c2 to
implement int $0xXX. gdb won't let me actually examine that address for
some reason so I don't actually know what it's hitting to cause the
loop/hang but no good can come of jumping to that address in any case...
Sanest solution seems to me to be to explicitly zero PFN 0 -- I have a
patch I just haven't had a chance to clean it up for submission yet.

Did someone make the boot allocator start at the bottom instead of the
top of memory or something?
Ian.
