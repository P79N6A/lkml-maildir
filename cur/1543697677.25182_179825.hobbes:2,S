I know this sounds weird, but sign extension is happening between
invocation of set_tv_freq and the dprintk in mt2032_set_tv_freq.

Except in one place where there is an implicit conversion to signed ints
in line 746:
746         mt2032_set_if_freq(c, freq*62500 /* freq*1000*1000/16 */,

Thanks for the clue. Perhaps the problem is gcc/athlon related?

I agree that the change is rather kludgy. I was using stock Mandrake
9.1/gcc3.2.2 on AMD Athlon 1.4GHz. I have seen the error pop up on the
Knoppix (2.4.18..2.4.20 kernels) also on the same box so it doesnt seem
to be distro-specific. I dont have a Intel system to check if the
problem is related to the cpu. Clues anyone?
Let me poke around in the assembly code tonight to find out why the sign
change happens on my box. I suspect this could be due to gcc/athlon
combo.
