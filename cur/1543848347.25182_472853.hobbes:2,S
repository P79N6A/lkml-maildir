I did. It complains about EDD as fatal error, some warnings about ACPI and
MMCONFIG, otherwise it says passed.
However, I suspect another BIOS bug:
ACPI Exception (acpi_processor-0681): AE_NOT_FOUND, Processor Device is not
present [20060707]
ACPI Exception (acpi_processor-0681): AE_NOT_FOUND, Processor Device is not
present [20060707]
(BIOS announces 4 processors while 1 dual core is present).
