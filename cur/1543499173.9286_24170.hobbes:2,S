The Red Hat 5.2 shipped kernel does indeed contain a newer AHA2940 driver
than the default. However as of 2.2.10 the kernel also contains the updated
aic7xxx driver, so if it was that then 2.2.10 should have suddenely worked
relibly.

When it hangs does it a) still respond to pings b) does right-alt scrolllock
a few times show anything (you will want to be outside of X11). If so then
the data from b) wil help find any hang. If not then you probably want
to run the kernel debug patch and see what it reports
