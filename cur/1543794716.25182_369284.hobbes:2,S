Why?
And it's still doing lock_page():
	nfs_file_direct_write()
	->filemap_fdatawrite()
	  ->do_writepages()
	    ->nfs_writepages()
	      ->generic_writepages()
	        ->mpage_writepages()
	          ->lock_page()

invalidate_inode_pages2() is better.  And using generic_file_direct_IO() is
better still, since it handles mmap coherency and only work upon that part
of the file which is actually undergoing IO.
