I have a directory with 39,000 files in it, and I'm trying to use the cp
command to copy them into another directory, and neither the cp or the
mv command will work, they both same "argument list too long" when I
use:
cp -f * /usr/local/www/images
or
mv -f * /usr/local/www/images
Is this a kernel limitation? If yes, how can I get around it?
If no, anyone know a workaround? I appreciate it.
