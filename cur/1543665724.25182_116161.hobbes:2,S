My suggestion (in order of preference):
 - sleep the max amount, and then restart as if a signal had happened
 - sleep the max amount (old behaviour)
 - consider it an error (new behaviour)
In this case the error case actually helped find the other unrelated bug, 
so in this case the error actually _helped_ us. However, that was only 
"help" from a kernel perspective, from a user perspective I definitely 
think that it makes no sense to have "sleep(largenum)" return -EINVAL.
And in the end it's the user that matters.
