I've upgraded one production mx to 2.6.28.2 plus my latest patch (the
rest are still running 2.6.27.6, which is prior to this limit)
Here's some figures with my latest patch after about 10 minutes running
to stabilise the startup figures:
kvm virtual mx:
0	39	0	230	4096	271872
production mx:
0	207	107	1811	4096	266555
The interesting figure in each case is the second one,
num_user_instances.  Interesting that the UID is listed as 0 though,
that's root!  107 is postfix, which makes sense.
As you can see, the production mx would have start choking epolls almost
immediately.  These machines are about 5 years old now.  4Gb of memory,
dual hyperthreading 32 bit Xeons.  They're the least powerful machines
we still keep running!
