Not yet, I'll make a quick hack for this when I get back next
week. It's pretty obvious now that the 2.4 kernel cannot get
enough information to select the right pages to evict from
memory.
For 2.5 I'm making a VM subsystem with reverse mappings, the
first iterations are giving very sweet performance so I will
continue with this project regardless of what other kernel
hackers might say ;)
cheers,
Rik
