I think CD burning is like the canary in the coal mine, if it stops 
working something is broken. It may be "better" to burn with ide-cd, in 
some hope of avoiding overhead which is small beyond measurement for 
data CDs on most systems, but it should work, and the fact that it has 
stopped working probably indicates something has changed which will 
later rise up to bite us with IDE tape, or MO, or avoiding ide-floppy 
for ZIP, or whatever.
If you think of it as a test program for the interface it matches 
reality better, except that many people cross boot between 2.4 and 2.5, 
don't want to build using Joreg's odd idea of header files, and 
generally use this interface for production use.
