I just realized the original code had one desirable
behaviour that my patch is missing, namely, it
reclaimed memory from dcache/inode every time swap_out
is called.  Please use the attached patch that
restores the original behaviour.  Otherwise, if the
interval is very long, no reclamation will happen
until swap_out() fails which in the common case is
unlikely.
Thanks,
Shantanu
