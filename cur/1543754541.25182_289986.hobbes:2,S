Has anybody ported Linux to a virtual machine?  Does anybody have any 
pointers aside from the lkml's abbreviated FAQ entry concering porting 
to a new processor?  What would be the best way of going about this?  Is 
there a supported architecture that is simpler than the others and/or 
better to use as a model?  What about the UML (User Mode Linux) 
architecture?  Are there doc's, FAQ's, etc. concerning this?   Should I 
just read the mailing list and harvest the source code?  Thank you for 
any (positive) input.
