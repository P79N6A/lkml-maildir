Btw, this may explain the differences between rms/FSF and me.
Richard Stallman is out to "improve the world". He thinks he has not just 
the moral authority and right, but the _obligation_ to tell others how to 
live their lives.
So rms feels he has to "spread his message", the same way those annoying 
people come to your door on Saturday in order to "save you". rms literally 
is saving you from a sin.
Me, not so much. I'm not out to "improve the world". I'm not saving you 
from any sin. I just have this project I started, and I think that if you 
improve on the project, you should let me use your improvements.
And I don't ask you use that license anywhere else. For your other 
projects, you should follow *their* licenses. I'm just asking you to honor 
my choice of license for those projects I started, and I designed, and 
where I conned other people into helping me under the same rules.
