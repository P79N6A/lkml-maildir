 From an app point of view, there are any number of reasons to check the 
time frequently.
--debugging
--flight-recorder style logs
--if you've got timers in your application, you may want to check to 
make sure that you didn't get woken up early (the linux behaviour of 
returning unused time in select is not portable)
--the app might be tracking it's own behaviour, measuring how long code 
paths take for its own accounting purposes
--emulators (vmware, UML, etc.) often want to check the time quite 
frequently
