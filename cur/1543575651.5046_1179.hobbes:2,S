what mobo/chipset are you using?  i and a bunch of other people have
been having very similar problems with this and the 2.4.0-test kernels.
we all use the tyan tiger 133 mobo with the apollo pro 133a chipset.  i
believe that the 2.2.18 usb support has been pulled from the 2.4.0-test
source, so i'm not surprised to be seeing this.
on the linux-usb list, i was talking with johannes erdfel and doing some
checks for him.  he thinks that it's a pci irq problem as the usb
controller (uhci and usb-uhci) don't get any interrupts on smp-enabled
kernels when apic is enabled.  i've written martin mares about this (but
to the email address listed on his web page -- not mj@suse.cz, yet -- so
it probably got dropped into /dev/null) and i'm eager to hear his
opinion on matters.  i'll bet that now that the problem has moved into
the 2.2 line, we'll be seeing more noise about it.
laramie, try disabling apic at the lilo prompt (add "noapic" after your
kernel image's name) and see if that helps.
