Ok, I've tested kernels from 2.4.0 to 2.4.22 and found that it's a 
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y which causes machine to hang. It seems like on 
ASUS P4533 motherboards this option is unsafe so it must be turned off. 
In RedHat kernels they turned on it after 2.4.18 that's why I saw the 
hangs. Actually the option help says that some machine may hang and 
probably it should not be on by default. Luckily I was able to fix that 
adding "apm=idle_threshold=100" to the kernel parameters without 
recompiling the kernel.
Maybe these motherboards/BIOS should be blacklisted?
