The patch was solely done due to people complaining and I even had a bugzilla
entry about it.
I expext Armin or Christian to speak up if this is a real problem for them.
PS. I did not do a revert since the original patch contained a nice cleanup.

I have just committed the following:

Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: allow depmod in cross builds again
depmod from module-init-tools 3.3-pre2 are reported
to work fine in cross build.
depmod from module-init-tools 3.1-pre5 are know to SEGV
Do not workaround older module-init-tools bug here.
The right fix is for users to upgrade module-init-tools.
