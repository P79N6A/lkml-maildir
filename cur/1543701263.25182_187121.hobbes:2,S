Ok. This looks much closer to the 2.4.x numbers you reported:
	real    13m50.198s
	user    0m33.780s
	sys     0m15.390s
so I assume that we can consider this problem largely solved? There's 
still some difference, that could be due to just VM tuning.. 
I suspect that what happened is:
 - slab debugging adds a heavy CPU _and_ it also makes all the slab caches 
   much less dense.
 - as a result, you see much higher system times, and you also end up 
   needing much more memory for things like the dentry cache, so your 
   memory-starved machine ended up swapping a lot more too.

So here 2.6.x actually outperforms 2.4.x

This is likely just an issue of reporting. Under 2.6.x your idle time will 
be reported as iowait, while in your 2.4.x kernel you don't even have the 
iowait support, so all idle time is just "idle", and not split up into 
_why_ it is idle.
