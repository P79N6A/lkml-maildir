VM pressure means that there is not enough free memory on the system...
Allocators have to reclaim memory.
Basically you cannot simply expect an increase in readahead size to
increase performance:
1) The files you created may not be sequential
2) The lack of memory on the system may be interfering in weird ways, and
maybe _INCREASING_ the readahead may decrease performance.
...
Also, remember: The real applications running on the system may not want
to read files sequentially, so increasing readahead is just useless.
