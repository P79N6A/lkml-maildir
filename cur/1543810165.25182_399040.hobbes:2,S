 Hi David,
  
  you're certainly right on the ixp4xx, but the are other uses
 for this driver which we are working on.. for example,
 some Cirrus Logic ARM based chips (ep93xx) have an ethernet device
 that could benefit from that.
  I'm pretty sure that there are and will be more devices
 with such requirements, with either proprietary or
 open source drivers. My opinion is that a maclist alike
 facility can clean some of the mess in that area.
  If we implement such a thing in userspace every distribution
 will need to be aware of a specific trick for a specific
 board. If we have a clean facility in the kernel, userspace
 will not need to care.
