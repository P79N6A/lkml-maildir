That was intentional, actually: I thought Christoph ought to have
a say in it first.  Then he or I would alert the stable team.
And it turns out, see other mail, that the patches wouldn't even
apply as is to -stable: let's forget 2/2 so far as -stable goes,
and I'll now look into versions of 1/2 for 2.6.23 and 2.6.22
(checking whether the problem really happens there or not).
