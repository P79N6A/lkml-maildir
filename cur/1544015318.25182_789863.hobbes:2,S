Right, g_zero should enumerate. It also provides data sink/source and 
loopback functionality.
If you want to test data traffic then g_file_storage would be a good 
choice as it behaves as a mass storage
device.
Example:
dd bs=1M count=64 if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/image_file
modrobe g_file_storage file=/tmp/image_file
(create partition and file system from host side)

UOC has to be enabled. This controller switches the UDC PHY to port 4 
and owns the mentioned
PAD_EN and APU bits. These bits live in the memory mapped register space 
of UOC. I use a
company intern tools to look at memory spaces of PCI devices. Lets 
forget these bits so far as I am
pretty sure that enabling UOC fixes the problem.
