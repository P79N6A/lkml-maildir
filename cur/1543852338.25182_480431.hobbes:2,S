I'm tracing down a case where suspend to ram/resume from RAM causes
horrible corruption but not immediately. From a PCI dump it appears that
we are not running the PCI quirks again on the S2RAM resume. Is this
actually the case or am I missing something scanning through the code.
If it is the case then we have multiple corruptors lurking because the
PCI config restore doesn't cover the special registers that need poking
in some cases.
