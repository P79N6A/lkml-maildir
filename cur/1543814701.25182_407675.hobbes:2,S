What prevents you from injecting a shared library and manipulating a 
suid executable?  Does the environment get cleared when you exec a suid 
program?  Or does the dynamic linker just notice euid != uid and ignore 
the LD environment variables?  If so then would adding the sgid bit and 
making the binary owned by a powerless group effectively prevent this 
attack vector to read it?
