Clarifies only partially.
I agree to put it there if its not used as a means to define whether
user locks are permitted or not. If that is the intention, then the current 
futex will need to check every access through find_vma(), which we
both know nobody wants to do.
So it can only be used for architectural hints, agreed ?
