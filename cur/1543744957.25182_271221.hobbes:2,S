Is part of the problem definition missing here?
or I missed it?
E.g., printk() and vprint() are asmlinkage but not sys_xyz()...
but I have a suspicion that they are OK.

so ignore the FP emulation, ignore functions with no arguments, right?
and omit "asmlinkage.*sys_xyz".  that leaves a handful of functions
which are <asm>, like:
acpi_status asmlinkage acpi_enter_sleep_state(u8 sleep_state);
csum_partial(), csum_partial_copy_generic(),
schedule_tail(), aes_enc_blk(), aes_dec_blk().
I don't see others than need to be fixed, but a script
would be a safer way to check, so I'm trying to nail down
the requirements ... and what tool to use, like is there
already a PERL [or python or xyz] script that parses C,
or would you *coff* recommend sparse?
