Hi,
The kernel contains some i387 FPU emulation code.
Is there any user land software to test the FPU emulation code?
I would like to be able to prove the correctness of the FPU emulation 
code in the Linux kernel, and also port the test program to other 
platforms that utilize FPU emulation. For example, DOS emulators like 
DOSBOX.
James
