Gaah. highstart_pfn is declared in <asm/highmem.h>, but that one is 
protected by a
	#ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM
	#include <asm/highmem.h>
in <linux/highmem.h>, so even though we include highmem.h, we never see 
the declaration.
Your config is insane, but anyway, does it compile if you just add back 
the extra "unnecessary" declaration of highstart_pfn?
