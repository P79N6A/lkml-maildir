I have a soundblaster Live.  I've historically used the OSS drivers as
they've worked well for me.  I just tried to load the emu10k1 which
loads without error, but mpg123 says it can't open the default sound
device.
Anyone able to do an lsmod or a listing of the drivers I need for an
SBLive?
Thanks,
  Robert
