I like this idea. 
The current implementation uses cpus_allowed because it is non-intrusive, 
as it does not touch the scheduler at all, and also maybe because it was 
easy to do this way since the cpuset development team seems to lack 
scheduler gurus.
The 'non intrusive' part was also important as long as the cpusets were 
mostly 'on their own', but if now it appears that more cooperation with 
other functions such as CKRM is needed, I suppose a deeper impact on the 
scheduler code might be OK. Especially if we intend to enforce 'real 
exclusive' cpusets or things like that.
So I'm really interested in any design/bits of code that would go in that 
direction.
