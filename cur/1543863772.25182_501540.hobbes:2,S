I agree, we shouldn't take mmapped page into account.
But Vaidy - even with your patch, we are still using the existing
reclaimer, that means we dont ensure that only page cache is
reclaimed/limited. mapped pages will be hit also.
I think we still need to add a new scancontrol field to lock mmaped
pages and remove unmapped pagecache pages only.
