Yes, there are potential compatibility problems.  Example: a machine with
100 busy httpd processes and suddenly a big gzip starts up from console or
cron.
Under current kernels, that gzip will take ages and the httpds will take a
1% slowdown, which may well be exactly the behaviour which is desired.
If we were to schedule by UID then the gzip suddenly gets 50% of the CPU
and those httpd's all take a 50% hit, which could be quite serious.
That's simple to fix via nicing, but people have to know to do that, and
there will be a transition period where some disruption is possible.
