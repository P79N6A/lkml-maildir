Everything's happy here using things "in production" so to speak. I
couldn't think of much else to be more informative/useful, so I just
ran dbench 16 on 6 spindles simultaneously. cfq io scheduler, ext3 fs's,
768MB/600MHz Athlon, 5 47GB 10Krpm U160 disks, 1 73GB 10Krpm U160 disk,
Adaptec 39160 dual channel U160 HBA. No idea if these numbers are good,
bad, or what, but things certainly seem to be doing well. There's also
some heavy NFS usage which isn't really performance-oriented things are
doing well with also (cross-mounted /home/ and a number of nfsroot fs's).
The earlier NFS problem report is being blamed on hardware (a potentially
dead PMAD-AA ethernet controller in a distinct client machine, not
anything in this machine) for now.
vmstat log attached.
