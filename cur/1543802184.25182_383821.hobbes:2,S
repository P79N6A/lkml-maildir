From what I can see it does icons on non-executable entirely based on
the extension and nothing else on the first pass.  Executables are
looked inside for an icon (and there seems to be cache effects at
times, especially visible on the desktop).  Then for images a second
pass generates icons depending on the contents (with, once again, a
cache hidden somewhere).
Not a bad strategy, too.  Doing a file(1) on everything can only be
slow given the random disk accesses it generates.  Maybe a file(1) as
a _second_ pass would work.
  OG.
