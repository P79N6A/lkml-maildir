Thanks for the clue.

Ok. The problem is building the DSO in the kernel from the various
individual functions depending on the CPU & app mode.

Ok. So the challenge is to write the necessary code in the kernel
to build that DSO based on the various functions after detection
of the CPU type.
Another option would be to pre-build a bunch of them at kernel compile
time. I have to investigate. The risk is that we end up with too
many combinations, thus bloating the kernel image.
Ben.
