Please cite an exact RFC reference.
The 576 byte requirement is for reassembled packets handled by the host.
That is if you send a 576 byte frame you know the other end will be able
to put it back together. Our handling of DF on syn frames is also broken
due to that misassumption, but fortunately only for crazy mtus like 70.
