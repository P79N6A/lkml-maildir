Hi,
I am using linux kernel 2.2.13 on a  Pentium PC.
I would like to keep track of the CPU time in user space of a process or
task. The user/system time currently implemented is not accurate enough,
its resolution is 10 ms.
The idea was to keep track when a process  enters/leaves the kernel space
and use the time stamp counter to measure the amount of time spend in
the kernel and substract this from the wall clock time. Note that I would like
to know the CPU time in user space for each process separately.
Anyone already implemented this ?
I started playing around with the kernel and added a call to a stop trace
routine
at the "restore_all" label in entry.S. I also added a call to a start trace
routine
in do_IRQ (for all interrupts), and at the entries system_call, lcall7 and the
label
error_code (to cover e.g. page faults(?)). In addition I keep track on the depth
of the entrances to the kernel through a counter to locate the last return into
user space.
Somehow I am still missing entries into the kernel as the stop trace routine is
called when the depth counter=0. Thus the stop trace has been called more often
than the start trace routine. Which entries into the kernel could I be missing?
Is this approach at all ok?
Sjaak Koot.
