Standard problem when the kernel ships files that are also overwritten
at run time.  You get permission problems if the kernel code is marked
read only.  After kbuild 2.5 goes in I have a list of FIXME files to
clean up.

Race conditions when running parallel make.  With kbuild 2.5 you do not
need to make clean before building, unlike the existing build system,
kbuild 2.5 gets it right.
