make defconfig on x86-64 prints this for me ..
drivers/net/Kconfig:1887:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'FEC_MPC52xx' refers to undefined symbol 'PPC_BESTCOMM'
drivers/net/Kconfig:1888:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'FEC_MPC52xx' refers to undefined symbol 'PPC_BESTCOMM_FEC'
I'm not sure why those selects are even being evaluated, as both those
options have 'depends on PPC_MPC52xx'
