disagree, merging synchronous requests would make much more sense than
merging asynchronous requests in the same syscall, it would make them
asynchronous with respect than each other without losing their global
synchronous behaviour w.r.t. userspace.
With async-io it doesn't matter at all to merge too much stuff (except to
avoid entering/exiting kernel that applies to synchronous operations
too).
