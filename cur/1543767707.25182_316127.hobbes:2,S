The following scenario is possible:
program1 with a thread thread1
1) you send SIGSTOP to program1
2) thread1 is now scheduled and run.
3) program1 is now run and before it is scheduled off it notices it has
a signal set, makes sure all threads in the group gets SIGSTOP set.
4) thread1 is now scheduled and run again. now before it is scheduled
off it will find a signal pending and set itself in SIGSTOP.
There are absolutely no guarantees when a signal will be delivered.
Signals are delivered asynchronously.

do_notify_resume()
	do_signal()
		get_signal_to_deliver()
			do_signal_stop()
				finish_stop()

You'll have to use reliable mechanisms to achieve what you're looking
for.
