Hello.
I'm not playing that game again.
Instead I'm letting you know that I'm building a git tree at the moment, and 
hope to start posting patches from it shortly and seeking to merge Suspend2. 
A few weeks ago I lacked the motivation to do it, but that has since changed.
If you want to provide useful, technical comments on how I can do things 
better, I'll be happy to accept and apply them. If on the other hand you 
attempt to start another flamewar, I'll just seek to exercise my self control 
and let those comments fall to the floor.
Regards,
Nigel
