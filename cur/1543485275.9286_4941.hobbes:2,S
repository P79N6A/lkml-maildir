Hello,
I just had this re-appear - I had this problem earlier (with a 2.0 kernel,
and with 2.1.74), and thought I had fixed it by using a different disk, but
it seems to be back now, and not depending on kernel version.
Under heavy disk load, the kernel reports 'AHA1740: asynchronous event D7 22
00 00 00', does a SCSI bus reset - and that repeats over and over, with
about 1-2 messages (and bus resets) per second, and will not recover from
that condition.
The problem is that once this has happened, the chances are good that it
will happen during the fsck on reboot, too.
I have tried multiple AHA1742 cards, different disk drives, active
termination ... any hints what to do about this?
System is a Jensen (150MHz DEC Alpha with EISA), 32MB RAM.
cu
Michael
