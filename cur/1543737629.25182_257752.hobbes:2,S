Hi Linus,
This is just a proper fix to stop the i830/i915 being built into the same
kernel I missed Romans post that contained it until now...
Please do a
	bk pull bk://drm.bkbits.net/drm-2.6
This will include the latest DRM changes and will update the following files:
 drivers/char/drm/Kconfig |   12 ++++++++----

   drm: Stop i830 and i915 both being build at same time
   Roman Zippel submitted this to lk but I missed it, it does
   what I tried to do badly before.
