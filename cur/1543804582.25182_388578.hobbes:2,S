Hi Jari.
Care to explain why it is needed to have this in your Makefile:
SR1:=$(shell if grep -q -s                             \
	"^basename_flags.*KBUILD_BASENAME.*KBUILD_STR" \
	$(LS)/scripts/Makefile.lib; then echo y; fi)
...
ifeq ($(SR1),y)
	EF += -D"KBUILD_STR(s)=\#s"
else
        EF += -D"KBUILD_STR(s)=s"
endif
Either something is missing in the support for external modules in the
kernel or you are overdoing some stuff.
If there is something missing in the kernel to support external
modules then please say so, so it can be fixed.
	Sam
