Ok if you want complex features like this you'll have to get rid
of some other code in your patch. 
One possibility is to keep only some state per CPU,
but do the sys configuration globally, but that's probably not 
enough.
Currently the bloat:feature ratio is imho not good enough at least.

It's not just smaller chunks, the end result should be simple too

Then please submit a separate patch to add time_before/after64 instead of trying
to work around that.

Please keep it in x86-64.

It depends on how ugly that patch is. Unification is fine as long
as it improves something, but if it requires weird hacks again it's a net loss.
