Where do you get 'tons'? There will probably be one for initial reset,
one for VESA based mode setting and a few more if there is device
specific code needed for a specific card.
Making console rely on a permanent daemon that is subject to getting
killed by the OOM mechanism is not a workable solution.
You also need to think about how cursors are handled. A non-root app
needs to be able to move the cursor. Actually moving the cursor
requires root. The in-kernel console system needs a cursor. It would
be much better if cursor control was implemented in the device
drivers.

Printk works from inside interrupt handlers currently. This is an
absolute requirement for kernel debugging that can't be removed.
Because of this requirement there has to be a way for all drivers to
draw the console entirely inside the kernel. You can not make calls to
user space from inside interrupt handlers.

Panics can occur inside interrupt handlers. You can't queue up printks
in this context and they display them later, the kernel just died,
there is no later.
