	known problem, patch sent to alan some time ago(may be i should
resync/resend?) for this dma_timer_expiry have several problems:
calls DRIVER(drive)->error - the one above, it's called with lock from
ide_timer_expiry
calls ide_dma_end - the reason for called while not waiting messages,
it's called again in ide_timer_expiry
there is one more locking problem known to me - HDIO_DRIVE_RESET,
but can not find out how to fix it properly.

have fun,
