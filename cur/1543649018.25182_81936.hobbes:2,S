Yes, test/setbit() are atomic, but that's not the point - the "do I
need to sleep?" check must be atomic with respect to
sleep_on(). Consider the following case:
if(testbit(...)) {
	// bit is TRUE now
	
	// now the interrupt handler runs:
	// setbit(FALSE)
	// wake_up_interruptible(...)
	
	interruptible_sleep_on(...);
}
Since wake_up() is called before sleep_on(), it will not wake you
up. If this case occurs, you will remain asleep forever.
You will probably find a few places in the kernel that suffer this
condition; the race window is very small so it's not likely to happen
in practice. But if I were developing a driver I'd definitely pay
attention to it...
A good description of the problem and solution is on page 287 of
Rubini's "Linux Device Drivers", 2nd ed. (I highly recommend this book
btw).
I just learned that there are macros in sched.h that encapsulate the
race-free solution (wait_event() and wait_event_interuptible()):
instead of the if() statement, you can write wait_event(..., !testbit());

Probably ioctl(). But ioctl() has the disadvantage that you can only
wait on one file descriptor. It's easy to provide both...

poll() should not return an error unless there is something wrong with
poll() itself. poll() merely tells the user that "some activity has
occurred on this file descriptor" - where "some activity" may include
an error. Device-specific errors should be returned when the user
subsequently calls read() write() or ioctl() on your device.
