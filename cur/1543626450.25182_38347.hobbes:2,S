Subject: [PATCH] Don't always ask about Intel or AMD RNGs

Hello.  The following patch hides the option for Intel (i8x0) RNG
support.  I suspect this is an ia32-only option, but since it's possible
that it's used on ia64 as well, this tests for both.  By similar logic,
the AMD (768) RNG support is only asked for on ia32 and x86-64.
