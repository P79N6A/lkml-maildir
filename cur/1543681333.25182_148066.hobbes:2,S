Hi!
Seems like some people have problems applying your patch.
I have put up a small howto how to compile the NVIDIA_kernel
with linux-2.6 at 
http://deltaanime.ath.cx/~blight/nvidia_kernel_with_2.6.html
The only thing what breaks it is that the version is no longer below 2, 6, 0 
which the 2.5 patch uses to check wether it's 2.5 or not ;)
hope this helps some poeple,
  Gregor
