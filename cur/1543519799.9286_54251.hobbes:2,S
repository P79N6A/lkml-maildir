Alan renamed "event" to "global_event" in 2.2.14pre, IMHO we should do
the same in 2.3.x. 
And: AFAICS, "event" is used for
* inode->i_generation in fs/ext2/ialloc.c
This one is new, and it's obviously wrong: everyone else uses "++event",
but this function uses "event++". AFAICS we should replace it with an
internal, ext2 specific counter.
* inode->i_version, file->f_version.
a) files: it's nowhere read, but it's updated by a few functions (eg
default_llseek(), but not by generic_file_read() although both functions
modify the file pionter)
---> it's superflous, remove it!
b) directories: it's required to protect from readdir()/unlink() races.
Btw, AFAICS, then SMP protection for the read-ahead information in
generic_file_read() is missing. I don't know if this is dangerous.
Perhaps we should add a spinlock to each filp?
