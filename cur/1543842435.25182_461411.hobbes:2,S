Subject: [PATCH 0/2] ieee1394: ohci1394: endianess bug in verbose debug log
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This fixes a debug macro on some big endian machines.  Related code is
touched up too to make it harder to introduce such bugs in the future.

 - ieee1394: ohci1394: more obvious endianess handling
Wolfgang, could you test and send an ACK?  The tlabel in each "Packet
received from node" message should match that of the previous "Packet
sent to node" line.  Example of a wrong log:

The received tlabel was always 48 on this Apple AluBook 5,8.
