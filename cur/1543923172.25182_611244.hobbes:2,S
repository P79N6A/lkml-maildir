At OLS this year, users wanted user space notification of OOM
for cgroup memory controller. When a group is about to OOM,
a notification can help an external application re-adjust
memory limits across the system.
Keeping some memory reserved for handling OOM, this scheme could
be extended to handle global OOM conditions as well.
