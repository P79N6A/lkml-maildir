Ok, try as try might, shm is still a nightmare in 2.3.99-pre2-5 with latest
shm patch for deadlocks by C. Roland.
The server runs fine until shm is mounted and Apache is started.  Apache
grabs one shm segment.  I can almost instantly cause the deadlock situation
by running a recursive wget.  I can not however find exactly where the
deadlock is happening because 'ps' can't read /proc and magic key T/P shows
IPs either outside the kernel space or in cpu idle etc.  dmesg is equally
useless.
