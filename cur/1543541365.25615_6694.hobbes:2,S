Hi Frank,
I agree with your analysis.  On my system, the `find $(FINDHPATH) ...`
construction expands to more than 49k.  (Every word in it has a copy
of $(TOPDIR) so its actual length depends on where you keep your
kernel tree).
I applied your patch to 2.4.0-pre6 and ran 'make dep' before and
after and compared the .hdepend file.  The .PRECIOUS rule was
split into 3 rules (one per xargs invocation), but that is ok.
After I corrected for the xargs splitting, I determined that
.hdepend has all the same information in it.
I recommend this patch for inclusion.
