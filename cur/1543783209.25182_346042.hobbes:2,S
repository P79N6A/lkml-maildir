This API is not intended for your application to use directly, but
for kernel APIs that take sleeps from userspace (like
pthread_mutex_lock()
and friends), so this scenario is not very likely.
Granted, sleep() can be implemented with it too, so...

endtime.ts += INTERVAL
[we all know opaque is relative too] 
Or better, use itimers :)
