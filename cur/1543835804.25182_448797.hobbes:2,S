Subject: [PATCH] md: Fix a bug that recently crept into md/linear
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch fixed a bug in 2.6.18-rc3 It would be good if it can get
into -final.
Thanks,

### Comments for Changeset
A recent patch that allowed linear arrays to be reconfigured on-line
allowed in a bug which results in divide by zero - not all
mddev->array_size were converted to conf->array_size.
This patch finished the conversion and fixed the bug.
The offending patch was commit 7c7546ccf6463edbeee8d9aac6de7be1cd80d08a.
Thanks to Simon Kirby <sim@netnation.com> for the bug report.
