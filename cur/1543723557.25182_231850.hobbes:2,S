Sorry, I was summarizing...  you definitely need a "personality" driver 
such as the ide-cdrom driver in order to make use of your DVD drive.
Really, though, I need to get off my butt and finish ATAPI in libata. 
Then, libata can drive PATA devices and we can get rid of all these 
headaches with combined mode being split between two drivers.
I'm going to be doing some libata hacking this weekend, looking 
particularly at a regression not caused by ACPI (hi Fabio).  I'll see if 
I can finish up ATAPI at that time.
