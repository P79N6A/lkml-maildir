Those aren't 64 bytes, but would tcpdump show the padding?

I havent done anything (just stock kernels), but the network operators claim
they have seen this before out of linux boxes and that it was caused by
illegally short arp frames.
I've used linux for years and this is the first time that I have had any
issues with any switch/router.
The problem that im facing is that the other side is learning my mac
address, but I fail to learn theirs and end up with packet loss. (I see lots
of arp who-has) but the other end never receive it.
Hard coding their mac address in solved the issue.
Thanks
