I'm not saying it is the right way, just I'm saying which is the
common way to say it in Spanish: We say "LCD" as "pantalla LCD"; and
althought "pantalla" means "display", it is more expressive that way.
We use "LCD" as a kind of display.
Yeah, we should use "pantalla LC", but we don't. However, in formal
written language, you should write just "LCD", like in English,
because it is wrong such "pantalla LCD".
Whatever. The point is that in English "LCD Display" is bad.
