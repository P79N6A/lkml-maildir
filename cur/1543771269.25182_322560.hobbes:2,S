Two things:
 - Why do you ask that?  There's only one QH that _ever_ has that bit set.
   And it's never removed from the async ring.
 - The question should be why the schedule is getting turned on in the
   first place, given there's no work for it to do.
Until I have some time available to actually look at this, all I can do
is answer questions and say "hmm, that's strange" given wierd facts.  The
wierdness here is why that "Async" status bit is ever getting set when
there's no work for it to do.
