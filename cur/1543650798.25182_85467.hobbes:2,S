The currently merged one is very, very simple, but relatively worthless.
There are no guarantees about catching an overflow, especially if it
happens in a long call chain _after_ do_IRQ with interrupts disabled.  
Ben's version checks on entrance to every function, making it _much_
more likely to be caught, even during an interrupt.  But, the currently
merged one doesn't have any strange compiler requirements, like adding
the -p option.
The irq stack patch would make the current check pretty worthless
because the check happens just after the switch to a fresh irqstack
would have happened.
But, if they both get in, it can be cleaned up later because even if
both are turned on, nothing will blow up.
