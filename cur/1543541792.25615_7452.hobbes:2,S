   I'm on 2.2.17pre13 (not the latest I know, I need to sort out
compiling latest and a reboot), my Mitsumi CR-4804TE CD-R/RW drive seems
to work happily enough with xcdroast to write one disk, but then goes
into super sulk mode, even getting to the stage of not wanting to mount
and read a normal CD (I don't think it's actively objecting to the old
Win95 CD I used to test...).  The first time this happened a reboot
seemed to clear it up.  I prefer not to reboot unless I have to so
haven't again yet.
   I guess I'll find the time to 'play' and get back with a more
detailed report.
   Oh, mine's a non-SMP PII-400 system btw, the CD-R as hdb (hda and hdc
are HD's).
thanks,
