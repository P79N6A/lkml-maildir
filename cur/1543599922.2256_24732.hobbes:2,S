aha!  So I'll check the diffs since 2.4.5 - thanks for the data point.  One
thing I did to make this error go away was increase the RX ring - I don't
have the code here, or I'd post a patch.  If you wait until tomorrow, I'll
pop into work and check out the diffs and post you an elementary patch, and
you can tell me if it goes away.
