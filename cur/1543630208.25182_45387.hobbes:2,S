and still the patch I included applied to 2.5.14-dj2...

sorry for the misunderstanding, after the crash I booted into 2.4.19-pre8
to recover my system and that did not work because the 2.5.14-dj2 kernel
destroyed the first descriptors of my ext2-filesystem. It was not meant to
report the kernel panic but to show the severity of the problem that was
done by the 2.5.14-dj2 kernel...

So this patch applied to 2.5.14-dj2 and I did not try to apply it to a 2.4
tree... again sorry for the misunderstanding.

2.5.13-dj2 also had this problem, I can't remember if 2.5.13-dj1 had the
same problem.

No thanks, it's fun to play with these kernels (even to recover a heavily
damaged system :)
