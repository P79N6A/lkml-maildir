Hmm I dont think its that easy. Actually the max. value is 16 TB because of 232*4096 (block-size) 
and this works on a 32 bit kernel.
df on 32 bit kernel:
(See attached image. Sorry, this kernel has not the required network-driver included. Had to take a 
screenshot)
SAME df on 64 bit kernel:
write(1, "Filesystem           1K-blocks  "..., 67Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available 
Use% Mounted on
) = 67
statfs("/", {f_type=0x58465342, f_bsize=4096, f_blocks=732384, f_bfree=508015, f_files=2939776, 
f_ffree=2901955, f_namelen=255}) = 0
write(1, "/dev/md0               2929536  "..., 58/dev/md0               2929536    897476   2032060 
  31% /
) = 58
statfs("/proc", {f_type="PROC_SUPER_MAGIC", f_bsize=4096, f_blocks=0, f_bfree=0, f_files=0, 
f_ffree=0, f_namelen=255}) = 0
statfs("/MD1", {f_type=0x58465342, f_bsize=4096, f_blocks=4407104, f_bfree=4403156, 
f_files=17638656, f_ffree=17638645, f_namelen=255}) = 0
write(1, "/dev/md1              17628416  "..., 61/dev/md1              17628416     15792  17612624 
   1% /MD1
) = 61
statfs("/MD2", 0xffa30614)              = -1 EOVERFLOW (Value too large for defined data type)
write(2, "df: ", 4df: )                     = 4
write(2, "`/MD2\'", 6`/MD2')                  = 6
write(2, ": Value too large for defined da"..., 39: Value too large for defined data type) = 39
write(2, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
statfs("/dev/pts", {f_type=0x1cd1, f_bsize=4096, f_blocks=0, f_bfree=0, f_files=0, f_ffree=0, 
f_namelen=255}) = 0
munmap(0xf7eea000, 4096)                = 0
So its definetly something with the kernel.
