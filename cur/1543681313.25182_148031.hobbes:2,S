I'm not sure if this is a general kernel issue, a hotplug issue, a USB 
issue, or a swsusp issue, so I'm hoping for guidance here.
I'm running 2.4.21 (+ latest ACPI, toshiba ACPI, and swsusp pre14) and 
to get my USB mouse working at all with swsusp I had to use hotplug.  
However, I'm having a number of problems.
1) 
The mouse, under normal operation at times of heavy CPU or disk usage, 
will be spontaneously lost.  No messages are issued.  Physically 
unplugging and re-plugging the mouse restores it.
2) 
No matter what I've tried, after switching to using hotplug 
(previously I had been using the 2.5 kernel w/o the hotplug daemon), 
I have been unable to get the internal pointer multiplexed into 
/dev/input/mice.  USB mouse shows up under /dev/input/mice and 
internal pointer shows up under /dev/psaux only.
3)
After suspend & resume, USB mouse is gone.  Physically replugging it 
doesn't help.  /etc/init.d/hotplug restart  fixes it.
Any ideas?  /proc cats, dmesgs, .configs, etc, available upon request.
Thanks much!
Eric
