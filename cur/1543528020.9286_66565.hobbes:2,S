No, it's worth discussing.

If the data are to be self-describing then we also need to know what each
one is.  So:
$ cat /proc/somefile
rate limit average eventname
%d %d %f %s
12 45 8.4 Some String
But now look at that first line.  Those tags must be fixed text or we get
all the same old respelling problems.  So why didn't we just have
$ cat /proc/something/rate
12
$ cat /proc/something/limit
45
$ cat /proc/something/average
8.4
$ cat /proc/something/eventname
Some String
I had to know that rate, limit, and average are numbers, and average is a
float, and eventname is a string, in order to use them, so now the formats
are irrelevant.
