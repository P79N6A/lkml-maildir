locks are intialised...code runs for a minute or so before panic'ing
I write my own wrappers to read/write_lock/unlock.
The call stack for the panic is:
panic
ipf_read_enter
..
do_softirq
=====
do_IRQ
common_interrupt
ipf_rw_exit
ipf_read_enter and ipf_rw_exit are being called for different locks.
The panic is occuring in the spin_lock() for the counter increment.
The counter incrememnt/decrement uses the same lock, regardless of
the counter being used.
I believe I'm hitting a race condition of sorts...I just don't know
who owns it yet - vmware or linux and I cant test running linux
natively at present because I only have one computer.
