I think this is correct, and (unfortunately ;) you are right:
we need rmb() even after finish_wait().
And we have to check ret twice, and the false wakeup is still
possible. This is minor, but just for discussion, can't we do
this differently?
	int finish_wait_xxx(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t *wait)
	{
		unsigned long flags;
		int woken;
		__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
		spin_lock_irqsave(&q->lock, flags);
		woken = list_empty(&wait->task_list);
		list_del_init(&wait->task_list);
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&q->lock, flags);
		return woken;
	}
Now, __wait_on_bit_lock() does:
		if (test_bit(q->key.bit_nr, q->key.flags)) {
			if ((ret = (*action)(q->key.flags))) {
				if (finish_wait_xxx(...))
					__wake_up_bit(...);
				return ret;
			}
		}
Or we can introduce
	int finish_wait_yyy(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t *wait,
				int mode, void *key)
	{
		unsigned long flags;
		int woken;
		__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
		spin_lock_irqsave(&q->lock, flags);
		woken = list_empty(&wait->task_list);
		if (woken)
			__wake_up_common(q, mode, 1, key);
		else
			list_del_init(&wait->task_list);
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&q->lock, flags);
		return woken;
	}
Perhaps a bit too much for this particular case, but I am thinking
about other cases when we need to abort the exclusive wait.
For example, don't we have the similar problems with
wait_event_interruptible_exclusive() ?
