Hehe. I have a HP box here which insists that there are 240 heads
on large IDE drives, not typical 255. This wreaks havoc when I
try to swap disks between this box and some saner one. Most OSes
do not boot after swap.
Of special note is total brain damage of NT4 bootloader.
Boot sector contains plain simple divide overflow bug and
even when fixed, the same bug is apparently present in NTLDR.
Result: cannot boot if NTLDR or kernel file is farther than 2Gb
from disk beginning.
