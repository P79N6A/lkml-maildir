I think we discussed doing exactly this at some earlier time, actually, 
just to try to throttle people who do lots of page dirtying. 
Maybe we even do it somewhere, but I tried to see it, and in the normal 
"nopage()" routine we very much try to _avoid_ locking the page (ie if 
it's marked PageUptodate() we'll return it whether locked or not). Which 
is fine - especially for readers, there really isn't any reason to ever 
delay them getting access to a page just because it's locked for write-out 
or something (once it's mapped, they'll have access to it regardless of 
any locked state in the kernel anyway).
So I don't actually see any serialization at all that would keep a random 
page from being paged back in.
