Someone called uart_set_termios without the BKL held, violating the locking
requirements.
Unfortunately:
1. You appear to be running a klogd that'll translate the addresses.
2. your ksymoops doesn't seem to know what modules are loaded.
This means we've lost the information telling us who called
uart_set_termios illegally.
