Stop here. You just demonstrated that your classes hierarchy doesn't fit
the problem. In your model _all_ buffer cache code is a festering layering
violation. Block devices are not derived from file (let alone from a
bogus 'device' - show me a place where _that_ would be used. And recall
Occam's Razor). There is a constructor that takes a block device and makes
a file. That's it. BTW, there's a constructor doing the opposite -
loopback, that is. It's not a 'derives from' relation - what you have is a
pair of independent classes with conversions between them.
