Thanks a lot for the report.
You are right, and I believe the change that broke things is
introduction of pci_fixup_parent_subordinate_busnr()...
The patch here does two things:
- hunk #1 should fix the problems you've seen when you boot without
  additional "pci" kernel options;
- hunk #2 supposedly fixes boot with "pci=assign-busses" option which
  otherwise hangs Acer TM81xx machines as reported.
Please try this with and without "pci=assign-busses". If it boots,
I'd like to see 'lspci -vvx' for both cases.
Ivan.
