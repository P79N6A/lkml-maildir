Actually for this you'd want a simple sructured kernel interface,
maybe via syscall, to get this information out of the kernel rather
than having your user space tool parse /proc. Having the kernel
generate ascii strings, then copying these to user space just to have
the user space application reparse them in the end is pretty expensive
when all you really want is to read an integer value or two.
Once you start cranking up the sample frequency the monitoring can
actually start affecting the system load.
