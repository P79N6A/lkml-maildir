You would loose the entropy pool feature; at least you wouldn't have

I don't know where one would need random to implement a /dev/repeat.
If you are refering to /dev/random, random(3) doesn't give you random
numbers that are nearly the same quality as the /dev/random version
(that's why they call it pseudo-random).
<man 3 random>
       The random() function uses a non-linear additive  feedback
       random  number generator employing a default table of size
       31 long integers to return successive  pseudo-random  num-
       bers  in the range from 0 to RAND_MAX.
</man 3 random>
RFC 1750 is enlightening. Especially "6.2 Non-Hardware Sources of
Randomness" as it deals with the randomness provided by standard hardware.
