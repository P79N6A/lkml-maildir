Yes, AS obviously does help gcc against io_load. My
"unfortunately" comment was just a pun, of course we
don't want to just test where AS does well.

Ah ok. And this change didn't affect other schedulers on mm2? Is
it reproducable with AS? I'll have to keep this in mind and take
another look at it after a few othe bugs are fixed.
