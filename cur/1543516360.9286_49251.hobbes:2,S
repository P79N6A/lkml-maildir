agreed, and i'll also take a look at try_to_swap_out as mikulas suggested.
i was thinking that this implementation would only boost the page's
reclamation priority.  shrink_mmap would simply put the page on it's
reclamation LRU a little earlier than usual, and the actual work of
reclaiming the page would happen later iff the system is low on memory --
but perhaps that's too simple?

vivek pai suggested mincore might be useful for applications that manage
their own user-space cache.  it's easy enough to implement, and might make
it easier to port applications that depend on it to Linux.
