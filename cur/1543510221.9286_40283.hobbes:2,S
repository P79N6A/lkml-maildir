Hi Alan,
I see that a stupid patch for the Panasonic DVD RAM drive has slipped
into the 2.2.x kernels.
It is stupid because it drops "CD" support (i.e. play audio) for that
drive. It is also stupid because it clutters the code with another
inline check for another specific device. It is furthermore stupid
because it doesn't work for any of the other DVD RAM drives out there. 
How about the attached one? It also cleans up the other inline check
for another device: the very old Toshiba CD.
It patches cleanly into 2.2.13pre8, so don't worry it was generated
against 2.2.12 .
(Should mail manage to munge on this: Try

Best regards,
			Roger.
