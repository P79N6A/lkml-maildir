Roman, IMO Thomas has been more than reasonable in replying to you - i'd 
have stopped replying to you after the first couple of mails, and we are 
at mail round 10 now! Thomas is being very patient with you. You are 
being difficult, and IMO you are wasting his and others' time.
the thing is that Thomas has advanced the whole issue of timeouts and 
timekeeping by leaps and bounds and he has written thousands of lines of 
new and excellent code for a kernel subsystem that has seen little 
activity for many years, before John got involved. One of Thomas' 
accomplishments is a timer/time design that allows the enabling of HRT 
timers via an _18 lines_ architecture patch. (!)
on the other hand, i have yet to see a single line of code from you and 
have yet to receive a single bugreport from you. (!)
so for me as a patch integrator and upstream maintainer the equation is 
very simple, and i am not nearly as tolerant as Thomas: shut up Roman 
already and show us the code!
really, start sending in patches. Testreports. Useful feedback. Those we 
can judge by their merits. Talk is cheap. The time subsystem has been 
dormant for years, and it has had more than enough talk already.
the moment you express yourself via patches we'll know that 1) you 
understand what we have done so far 2) you have useful ideas of what 
should be done differently 3) you have the coder capability to implement 
and test those ideas. Patches wont be ignored, i can assure you. Get the 
patches rolling!
	Ingo
