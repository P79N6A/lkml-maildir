Cool.  So explain to us how Aegis handles the following:
    . disconnected operation with updates to all repositories
    . undo - including things you don't do but incorporated
    . multiple views, each of which include some subset of the others
    . compressed repositories
    . disk and/or file systems which corrupt the underlying files
    . low bandwidth links
