Looking at this chicken-and-egg problem of booting from an array from
administrator's point of view ...
What do you guys think about Intel's EFI? I think it would be the most
apropriate place to put a piece of code that would scan the disks, assemble
any arrays and present them to the OS as bootable devices ... If we're going
to get a common metadata layout, that would be even easier.
Thoughts?
