I have two Class-C Networks.
e.x.
a) 192.168.10.0
b) 192.168.11.0
In the Moment there are only computer in a) But in the Future all will
wander into the b) Net. For a short period of time the computer should be
reached in both Networks. BUT i don't have the possibility to give them
both IPs. So i thought about putting a Linux-Computer into the route which
translates the old Adress to the new, and back when the IP-Packet goes
back into "the world".
The translation between the old and the new network is as simpel as
possibel.
10.1 becomes 11.1
10.2 becomes 11.2
and so on.
In the lastest 2.2.0pre Kernel i found the Point "IP: fast network address
translation (NEW)" which seems to do just what i want. But there isn't any
Documentation for the "iproute" command. (I found the programm on a
FTP-Site described in Documentation/networking/policy-routing)
Can somebody help me out with a command-line for iproute. Or give me a
hint about other ways to do it. (I have to do this for 16 Class-C
Networks!)
Bis denn
