Thanks.  cpualloc patches rebased on top of it (I had to include the module
patch I've got queued for 2.6.29, otherwise gratuitous conflicts):
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rusty/tj-percpu-cpualloc master
Boot tested here, but that's no guarantee that something didn't break.
I'm going to be occupied with finishing off cpumask_t this cycle, so I'd be
happy for you to take ownership of any and all of these that you want to keep.
I'll try to keep up with other patches as you post them.
Thanks!
Rusty.
