Yeah, libata is way too noisy on ATAPI.  In ATA, errors were rare so you 
needed all the info.  In ATAPI, some "errors" are expected, and simply 
reported back to the application.  Unfortunately, the solution is 
observation and iteration:
Console spews messages.  Users yell, and paste said messages.  Observe 
ATAPI behavior and return codes, and adjust libata.  Repeat.
As an aside, most recent SATA cd/dvd drives support "asynchronous 
notification", which means you don't have the poll the drive.  HAL needs 
to support that.

The entire box or just the console?
