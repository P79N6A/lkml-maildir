Oops!  [So that's why Mr. Gooch's response didn't make sense to me:

Hmm...
While thinking about this, it occurred to me that you could work
around any of a variety of problems by reserving a symlink prefix
[perhaps by putting some placeholder device file at that prefix]
and using the rest of the symlink as device identification.
Dunno if this sticks in anyone's craw, but it's something to
think about.
