Has nothing to do with the gart?

The normal rule is that anybody who needs big bootmem allocations
need to make sure they're high enough to not fill up first 4GB.
For small allocations like most of bootmem it doesn't matter because 
they're, um, small.
If vmemmap doesn't do that vmemmap needs to be fixed.
