Yeah, I've got Debian boxes that have never *not* netbooted (one Dell  
Op^?^?Craptiplex box whose BIOS and ACPI sucks so bad it can't even  
load GRUB/LILO, although Windows somehow works fine).  So they boot  
PXELinux using the PXE boot ROM on the NICs and it loads both a  
kernel and an initramfs into memory.  Kernel is stock Debian and  
hardly has enough built-in to spit at you, let alone find network/ 
disks, but it manages to load everything it needs off the  
automagically-generated initramfs.
Cheers,
