Gidday,
Some news:
* man-pages now has an (irregularly updated) blog:
      
http://linux-man-pages.blogspot.com/
* Since man-pages-2.69, each man page now includes a COLOPHON
  section at the end of the page which indicates the version of
  man-pages in which this page is released, and also contains a
  pointer to the man-pages web site.
Repeating some old news:
* man-pages now has a website:
      
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages
  The site includes HTML versions of the current set of man-pages.
* The list linux-man@vger.kernel.org has been created for
  the purpose of discussing Linux man page bugs, patches,
  and maintenance.  To subscribe, send a message to
  majordomo@vger.kernel.org, with the body:
        subscribe linux-man
Back to the news as usual...
I recently released man-pages-2.70.
This release is now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    (Note the s/manpages/man-pages/ in these paths;
    a symlink with the old path will exist for
    a limited time.)
Changes in this release consist primarily of formatting and consistency fixes.
Cheers,
Michael
(man-pages maintenance is supported by Google, as a Google engineer 20%
project.)
