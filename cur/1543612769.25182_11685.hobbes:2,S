Sorry, but this is bullshit. You even included an example script with this
"error" (Documentation/filesystems/devfs/rc.devfs). You suddenly change
the behaviour of devfs during a stable release in a noncompatible way.
Distributions and their users that followed _your_ advice are suddenly
fucked up, that's irresponsible. How do you think devfs should be ever
taken seriously?
bye, Roman
