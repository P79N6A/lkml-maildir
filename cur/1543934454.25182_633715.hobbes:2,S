My apologies, testing/compiling on X86_32 here.

Well, this of course is not the end of the road, but it makes it
obvious where the differences between 32/64 bit lie and allows
further cleanups to unify these areas over time.  This is meant as
a no functionality change path at first.....and it does point out that
for the most part the files are _very_ similar to each other.
So my plan for now was to move forward with no functional changes and
esentially ifdef or reorder code until we get to identical fault_32/64.c
which then gets moved to a single fault.c
Then the cleanups happen in one place in one file and it should be easy
to audit the series at the end.  But for further patches I'll wait until
the series is further along and tested before submitting.  This was how
the kprobes unification went and I think it works fairly well this way.
But, if the end result is too ugly, it won't bother me at all if it
doesn't go in.
