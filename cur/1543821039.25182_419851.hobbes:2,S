Subject: [PATCH 0/6] UML - Small patches for 2.6.17
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/28/167

These patches are 2.6.17 material.  They are small bug fixes and cleanups - 
the one functional change, skas0 support for 2G/2G hosts, is innocuous and 
tested.
