You need to resolve the symlink, back to the originating subsystem the
device belongs to.
Just better read the flat directories /sys/bus/*/devices/*, /sys/class/*/*,
and you get the subsystem values for free, instead of searching through
the directory tree in /sys/devices/.

Everything can be a symlink or a directory, you can't assume one or the
other. You better start from the buses and classes. The udevtrigger code
or the HAL coldplug code work with all versions of sysfs, just look at
these as an example.
