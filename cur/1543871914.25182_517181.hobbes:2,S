Hi!

> 	  one in trampoline.S
> 	- Take the jump to 32bit from real mode using ljmpl. Makes code
> 	  more readable.
> 	- After enabling long mode, directly take a long jump for 64bit
> 	  mode. No need to take an extra jump to "reach_comaptibility_mode"
> 	- Stack is not used after real mode. So don't load stack in

ACK, provided it was tested.
