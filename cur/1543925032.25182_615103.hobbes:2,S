Did that chunk starting with "clean-up completed biofill operations" end
up where it belongs? The patch with the big context moves it to a different
place from where the original one puts it when applied to 2.6.23...
Lately I've seen several problems where the context isn't enough to make
a patch apply properly when some offsets have changed. In some cases a
patch won't apply at all because two nearly-identical areas are being
changed and the first chunk gets applied where the second one should,
leaving nowhere for the second chunk to apply.
