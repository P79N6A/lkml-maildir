It wants to. What happens is this
-	The IDE layer detects the raid chip
-	We check it isnt a supertrak hardware raid
-	If it isnt we add the chips as basic ide devices
-	The ataraid module loaded on top of those opens the ide disks and
	hunts for promise and hpt raid descriptors
-	When it finds the raid descriptor it creates an additional
	/dev/ataraid/.... device
Because our ataraid driver actually sits on top of the existing IDE drivers it
requires they grab the devices. This also allows end users to issue commands
directly to the drives (for example for SMART)
