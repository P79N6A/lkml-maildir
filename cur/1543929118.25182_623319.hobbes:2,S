Which alternative kernel does the above comment apply to?

For the record network drivers should not be affected.  As a practical
measure that just gets unmaintainable and it is unnecessary.
There are specific exceptions where network drivers mess with the userspace
interfaces where I do have some impact.  However if you are messing
with our userspace interface especially with network namespaces in place
I don't see how it is possible for you to be anything other then a derivative
work, and something we need in tree to keep maintenance a manageable thing.
It should just be the core of the network stack that struct net has some
effect on.

Does ndiswrapper break?  If so what dubious and unsupportable thing is
it doing?
