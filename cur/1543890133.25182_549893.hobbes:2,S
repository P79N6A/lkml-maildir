Hmm, so this would be a problem for block_dev.c as well, then?
Because it would be possible to have a dirty block dev page
have its buffers reclaimed and then reinitialised via
init_page_buffers, AFAIKS.

Accounting is done in set_page_dirty.

That's what the generic set_page_dirty does. What I want to know
is why *doesn't* it make sense to reuse the generic set_page_dirty?
Unless there is a good reason, then reusing is better than writing
your own.
