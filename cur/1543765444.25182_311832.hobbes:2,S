Folks,
FYI:
In testing with 2.6.12-rc1 and -rc2, we've been encountering an issue on SMP machines with the loading of scsi_mod and sd_mod modules. The sd_mod load fails with unresolved symbols. It appears to be a race condition based on how quickly the modules load. This works fine on uni systems and on 2.6.11.
Evidently, this problem has been before and is resolved by a short delay between module loads.

Given it's been around for 2 -rc itterations, I expect it needed some highlighting.
