I find it quite easy already but I guess a few macros would improve
it even more. The routing attribute macros could be made generic to
so can benefit from the advanages of TLVs.
Evgeniy, Sorry for not having time earlier to give your patch a
review. I'm not yet through completely and won't comment on the
overall architecture until I have understood it all.

This is not correct, what happens is:
size = NLMSG_SPACE(sizeof(*msg) + msg->len);
 --> align(hdr)+align(data)
size - sizeof(*nlh)
 --> (align(hdr)-hdr)+align(data)
NLMSG_PUT pads again to get to the end of the data block (NLMSG_LENGTH)
 --> align(hdr)+(align(hdr)-hdr)+align(data)
At the moment align(hdr) == hdr since nlmsghdr is already aligned
but this might change and your code will break.
