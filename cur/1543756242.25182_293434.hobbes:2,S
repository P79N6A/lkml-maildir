But we are talking about the default order.

But it is not undefined, and if it is a well-defined order (and it is), 
then it should have a sane order.

Well, it can be bad, maybe it should be avoided. But if someone wants 
guessing, why not provide him a (imho) more reasonable order of 
guessing? I do think vfat should be tried first. If you are doing for 
example some kind of recovery you wont bet on autoguessing. But if you 
just want to use it, use might, and in that case you want long 
filenames, ie vfat.
