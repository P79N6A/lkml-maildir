Dave,
I'm looking for a good place to add yet another cpuset hook, this
one to keep a nodemask in my top (root) cpuset always equal to the
current value of node_online_map.
The motivation for this, if you're interested, comes from the
following threads, which added similar cpuset tracking of the
cpu_online_map:
  cpusets not cpu hotplug aware
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/21/128
  [PATCH] cpuset: top_cpuset tracks hotplug changes to cpu_online_map
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/24/107
(I cc'd the victims of these threads here, in case they're interested.)
From what I see so far, the right place to call my cpuset routine to
update its copy of node_online_map would be right after the call:
	node_set_online(nid);
in the routine mm/memory_hotplug.c:add_memory().
Does that seem like a plausible sounding place to you?
