I have a 29160N card in a PowerMac G4. It used to work fine with an old
UW SCSI disk I had there. Today, I flipped this drive with a real
Ultra160 one , and now, the kernel won't boot. It's giving me an endless
stream of SCSI reset timeouts on bus 0.
Any clue ? I don't really need this disk in Linux (at least not yet), but
I don't neither want to plug/unplug the disk each time I boot linux or
MacOS...
The disk is a Quantum ATLAS_V__9_WLS rev. 0230
Anything I can do to help tracking the problem ? It's difficult to get
the actual output of the driver in verbose mode as it is scrolling quite
fast and I have nothing like a serial console on this box. The kernel
won't boot without noprobe so I can't dump dmesg output.
Ben.
