We've been in that state for a long time... (carefull updating that libc.so
file... can't overwrite/delete without having some REAL problems show up.)
It just calls for some carefull activity. If rm is being replaced, first
rename it; then put new one in place; chmod old; delete old. It is directly
comparable to the libc.so update procedure.
I should have left off the "very simple" remark.
