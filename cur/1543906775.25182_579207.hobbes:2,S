You've introduced infrastructure to permit different machine types to
provide their own reboot hooks, and instead of actually providing a
machine-specific implementation, you've just hacked the native
implementation ith machine-type checks. This is conceptually no different
from your previous hack of sprinkling Dreamcast hooks in process.c.
The entire point of this abstraction is so that you can push what logic
you need down in to your board directory and _not_ have to shove this
sort of pointless crap in to the common code.

If there was something you were unclear about, perhaps you should have
asked for clarification instead of ignoring it? I didn't think any of
these points were terribly difficult to parse.
