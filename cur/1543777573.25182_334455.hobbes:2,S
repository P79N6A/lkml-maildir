In the emulation, video vs audio is 40% cpu vs 5% cpu, 16.7ms frames instead of
50ms frames. When your cpu requirements are higher and your frames are shorter
the likelihood of dropping a frame, especially under load, will skyrocket as
your timing granularity decreases. Clearly 250HZ is not as good as 1000HZ for
this, and I assume your midi example.
