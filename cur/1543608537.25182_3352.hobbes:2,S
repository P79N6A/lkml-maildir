Why can't the elevator do that?  I'm all for better performance, but if
the elevator can do it, then it will work for other file systems too.

This may be what is inhibiting the elevator...

What settings are you suggesting?  The 2.4 elevator queue size is an
order of magnatide larger than 2.2...

My God!  I'm no kernel hacker, but I would think the first thing you would
want to do is keep similar data (in this case similar because of proximity
in the dir tree) as close as possible to reduce seeking...
Is there any chance that this will go into ext3 too?
