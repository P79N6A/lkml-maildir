Yes and no. I benchmarked but only with one HD... (I don't have two HD in
my P5 I use for heavy benchmarking). With only one HD bonnie was running
fast as usual. I may benchmark using the ZIP drive though.
To make it a per-device thing we can simply sue an array of atomic_t for
every device but I am not convinced that my way is the right approch, we
may want something of more clever.
Anyway it's working greatly here with one only HD and until we'll do the
right thing I _have_ to continue to use it in order to be able to work
while I am copying large data to disk.
