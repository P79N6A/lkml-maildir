I agree with you that big-bang changes are not acceptable. This wasn't 
however what I had in mind.

What I proposed was to "renovate" a _part_ of the SCSI subsystem (the 
core and the interfaces of the rest of the subsystem to the core) with 
the 2.6 kernel as a basis. This is a huge difference to 2.5. Changes 
took place everywhere in 2.5, many of them drastic.
I agree with you that the incremental approach is preferrable whenever 
possible. I even believe that this method could be applied to the SCSI 
core cleanup. However, concerns were voiced that this method would 
effectively lead to a double SCSI core: The old one, and a new one in 
parallel to it which doesn't share much code with the old one. (At least 
for some time, perhaps for a too long time.)
It has been said multiple times that this would not be desirable for 
reasons of /a/ more kernel bloat (while the goal was to remove existing 
bloat and lay foundations to avoid future bloat), and /b/ massive 
maintenance burden of two parallel infrastructures.
So that's why I said that *short-term* breakage right on top and right 
below the core should be accepted.
Again, the huge difference to the 2.5 times would be that all this would 
happen on top of a relatively stable kernel. (Stable in two senses.)

What I was referring to was to clean up a _part_ of the subsystem (the 
core), not to replace the subsystem. I admit though that my wording left 
much room for misunderstanding.
Furthermore, note that the "scsi-cleanup tree" which I referred to is 
not meant to be a fork. It should merely be another working stage before 
the -mm stage. And let me add that this stage should be left as soon as 
possible.

I agree with you on that. Again, although my post may have sounded like 
it, I did not want to advocate the "throw it out and replace it all" 
approach.

Absolutely.
However I don't agree with you that _every_ little step must keep 
everything working. I believe that this may actually make the transition 
less easy to follow.

I agree with you on these advantages of the "(try to) keep everything 
working after each patch". Although the monitoring of performance is 
less important during the initial stage of the cleanup of the core.

Agreed. This is absolutely not what should be done.

OK.
