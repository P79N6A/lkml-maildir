In its current state it has bugs and so should appeal only to
programmers who like to work with cutting edge stuff.
So long as you keep insisting it has to have some kind of slow
transactional sync to disk in order to be reliable enough for
enterprise use, I have to leave you in my FUD filter.  Did you
read Ric's post where he mentions the UPS in some EMS products?
Ask yourself, what is the UPS for?  Then ask yourself if EMC
makes billions of dollars selling those things to enterprise
clients.
