Don't complain, build your own and test it ;-)
Apply my patch
http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~ioe/oom_kill_api.patch
and install your own OOM handler using install_oom_killer() 
from <linux/swap.h>. It has all the needed documentation inline
that will be build along the kernel-api-book.
Have fun researching in this area.
PS: Applies cleanly since oom_kill.c exists and also against
   2.4.0-test11-pre1.
