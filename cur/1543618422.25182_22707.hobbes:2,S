It is working somehow, and the 2 degrees are significant in my case, because
the 45°C is pretty stable in unloaded state with apm enabled. Tmax is around
48°C when compiling kde, transcoding divx or the like.
As noted in another message here, I'am going back to apm because it appears
that vlc became sluggish (& back to 45°C CPU base temp. & ~15% base load
from apmd-idled, I bet :)

I know, and I think Daniel should have noted that one have to disable APM to 
get ACPI power savings work. Would have saved me one reboot..
