Well it's not SuSv2 standards compliant:
    
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/ftruncate.html
    If the file previously was larger than length, the extra data is
    discarded. If it was previously shorter than length, it is
    unspecified whether the file is changed or its size increased. If
    ^^^^^^^^^^^
    the file is extended, the extended area appears as if it were
    zero-filled.
How "legitimate" relates to "SuSv2 standards compliant" is your call.
