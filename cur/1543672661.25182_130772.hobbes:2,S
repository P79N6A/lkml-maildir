I believe it shifts the entire virtual range up(/down depending on your point
of view). Each page in the virtual address range (whether it physically
exists or not) has a descriptor. To reserve one requires that the descriptor
be set to "does not exist, no read, no write". Then any access to that page
can/will generate a trap.
