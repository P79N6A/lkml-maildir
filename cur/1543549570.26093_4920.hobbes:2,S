Well, I just thought there could be confusion between 'md' -> 'multiple
disks' versus 'md' -> 'Linux RAID drivers' which is probably the more
common association.  It's a documentation issue as much as anything,
and you've basically taken care of that in -pre6.

No, actually I was more arguing against 'sm' than anything else.
Originally I thought the directory 'md' was just fine; it was only when
Andrea brought up the name issue that I started thinking of LVM and the
alternatives.  By all means leave it as it is.
