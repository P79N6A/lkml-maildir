There were some questions about my message.
I took the liberty to combine them to reduce email traffic.
My apologies if you are offended.
>> 2. Why in the kernel?
> Why does the kernel necessarily help?
The problem of userspace realizations is that
a. thay can not store resources together with data.
b. thay must index files by full names.
Only the kernel has direct access to the disk.
I.e. libraries use *COMPLETELY* DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS.
(See the example below.)

No, user->hardware->user is just a trifle.
(example <-- )
- scanning /etc/magic for 1000 files in directory is *seconds*.
- parsing extensions (DOS sort of metadata) is milliseconds.
- following @albod/type is microseconds.

To give 50 Mb for 'file types' cache only???
IMHO it's much uglier than fixing findutils.

a. What is simpler: one powerful mechanism or 100 simple mechanisms?
b. What simpler kernel mechanism?
If you store somewhere additional data - you must rewrite mv, aren't you?

Personally I am not satisfied with file managers perfomance.
'DOS Navigator' is 1000 times faster than kfm determines file types.
(DOS uses file extensions)

You are lucky! But some of us use sluggish file managers, etc. :-(
> parsing conf files is slow?  Where'd anybody get that idea from.
I did not benchmarks: I only yawned and listened to the HDD.
> How often do you parse conf files?
a. Initialization of * program.
     For comparison: BeOS starts (with full GUI) in 6 seconds.
b. loading xpms.
c. logging dynamic data.
                    Best regards.
                              Alexander.
