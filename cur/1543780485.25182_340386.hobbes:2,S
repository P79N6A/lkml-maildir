I think the following should be changed on the kernel.org web site?
In "New to Linux?" Section
    Note, however, that most distributions are very large,
    so unless you have a _very_fast_Internet_link_ you may want
    to save yourself some hassle and purchase a CD-ROM with
    a distribution; such CD-ROMs are available from a number
    of vendors.
I don't think that "very fast internet link is a good way to describe 
what is meant?
Maybe we should tell them how large the distrubution are (650mb and 
more) or
instead we could say say that we recommend above a certain bandwidth.
The confusion is as follows:
I have a good cable connection (~5mb/s) but I wouldn't consider this 
"very fast" because
I know of much faster connections. Would this scare me away from 
downloading Linux
or even using it at all? Probably.
Just thought it's best to be clear.
