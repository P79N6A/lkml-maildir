Roman Zippel suggested something like this, I am perfectly fine with
putting a "disclaimer" like this in the doc.
It was _never_ my intention to imply that BK is required for kernel

I want to actively dispute that notion... while encouraging its use,
since I believe BK is a useful tool for kernel development.
