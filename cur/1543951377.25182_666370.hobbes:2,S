Yes, the ESS1888 driver failed to work on Alpha about the 2.6.14 to  
2.6.16 kernel.   It came right with alsa release 1.0.13 (IIRC) and I  
have been running the ESS1888 driver on an Alpha XP1000 without  
problems for about a year.  I have been using mocp and mplayer on a  
fairly regular basis.  My Mplayer version uses the OSS interface by  
default.  Not sure, off-hand, what mocp is using.
For the last three months I have been playing with other sound cards  
(the quality of sound from the ESS1888 leaves a lot to be desired,  
imho) and haven't used the ESS1888 recently, so if a regression has  
been introduced after kernel 2.6.22 then it is likely I wouldn't see it.
Sorry, but I am not in a good position to do testing of the ESS1888 at  
the moment.  A week or so ago my system and home partitions shat  
themselves and I had to reinstall from 3 month old backups.  It has  
just happened again - two nights ago.  Don't know what is causing it -  
whether it is hardware fault (I can't find any disc block errors), the  
2.6.24.2 (and 2.6.24.3) kernels I had recently upgraded to, or the  
recent update from Debian testing, or the switch from the internal  
SCSI card and disc to an installed SATA card and disc that I did three  
months ago (though that one has worked for the first two and a half  
months without flaw).  Maybe I should start a new thread with a report  
of that just in case it is a kernel problem???
