You can kiss any useful support from this group if any binary kernel modules
have *ever* touched the kernel you run.
However, if you can reproduce the same problem without any binary modules
*ever* being loaded since the last reboot, then you will probably get support.
*ever* includes loading and then unloading a binary module within the
current session.  Session being the entire time a kernel runs without being
rebooted.
