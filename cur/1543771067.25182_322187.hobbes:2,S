Heh, good point.
However, it is valid only if program writes in every byte in a cacheline.
Then sufficiently smart CPU may avoid reading from main RAM.
(I am not sure that today's CPUs are smart enough. K6s were not)
If you have even one uninitialized byte (struct padding, etc) 
between bytes you write, CPU will have to do reads from main memory
in order to have cachelines with fully valid data.
Kernel compile did finish faster with nt stores, tho...
