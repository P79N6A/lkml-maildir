Yes, you have a point.  However doing it in a cross-arch way will
require building more of a shared abstraction about hugepage pte
entries that exists currently.  And that will mean making significant
changes to all the archs to create that abstraction.  I don't know
enough about the other archs to be confident of debugging such
changes, but I'll see what I can do.
That should let the actual handle_mm_fault->hugepage_cow codepath be
shared.  However how the hugepage ptes fit in with the rest of the
pagetables varies from arch to arch - on ppc64 we're considering
putting hugepages into their own entirely separate pagetables, even -
so anything that actually walks the pagetables (like
copy_hugetlb_page_range()) will still have to be arch-specific.
