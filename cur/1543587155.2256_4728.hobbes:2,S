Subject: Patch to abyss.c against 2.4.2-ac28
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is my first time sending in a patch to the kernel. 
This is a one line fix to the abyss tokenring driver in 2.4.2-ac28
I got this fix from the driver maintainer who said 
"I guess I really should send this in to Linus"
I'm just going to go ahead and jump the gun and submit it ;)
