It seems to me that you do not have glibc-devel or any other name it
can have on your distro. It's very likely that after that you will be
missing a few other development packages, but you'll quickly find them
one at a time.

Possibly that you will also need some random kernel-header-xxxx package,
I don't know how it's packaged. Install the libc headers first to see.

If you're a newbie, you're not encouraged to try building GIT kernels.
They are *very* likely to break during build with nasty errors. You'd
better get the official releases in tar.bz2 form which are know to build
and work for most people.

not to my knowledge.
