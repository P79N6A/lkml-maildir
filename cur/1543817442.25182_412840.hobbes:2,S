No. The CPU (which is connected via the host bridge) tries to access the
_newly created_ bus with bus numer 06 -- and it can't find a way to it, as
the first bridge only exports bus 01-01 below it, and the second one (the
one in front of the yenta socket) only exports bus 05-05, not 05-09 which it
should. Therefore, please try pci=assign-busses.
