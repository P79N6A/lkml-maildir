Potentially.  One scenario would be a block driver, which needs to
work with scatterlists.  dma_map_sg() is allowed to coalesce the
scatterlist entries, as with an IOMMU.  If it does that, there can
no longer be a one-to-one linkage between addreses provided to that
driver, and the dma addresess.  (Likewise, addresses in HIGHMEM are
not normally going to have kernel virtual addresses.)  So providing
both types of address is no longer practical with scatterlists.

Which is exactly why the current "mmc_spi" code doesn't use the
dma_map_sg() interface.  Instead, it goes in more byte-size chunks,
taking care to provide both dma and pio addresses.  It's a PITA,
but at least it's coded now.
