Hi All,
I am migrating my loadable module to work with the 2.6 kernel.
I have actually managed to make everything working except for
one thing. When I am loading my module (using the new
modprobe), its name, as appearing in lsmod, is KBUILD_MODNAME instead
of the module's real name. What am I missing? Is there
a define for the module's name that I should add somewhere?
 Kind Regards
  Idan
