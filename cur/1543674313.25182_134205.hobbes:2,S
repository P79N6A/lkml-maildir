Hi all,
a few days ago I noticed that red hat 
(
http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-172.html
) released a new 
kernel with a fix for a denial-of-serice attack against the routing 
table of the kernel.
I wonder if there is a official patch for 2.4.x (2.4.18 would be nice) 
and/or if a patch will go into 2.4.21....
thanks,
  Michael
