Subject: [PATCH 2.6.19-rc1 00/10] Kernel memory leak detector 0.11
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a new version (0.11) of the kernel memory leak detector. See
the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more detailed
description. The patches are downloadable from (the whole patch or the
broken-out series):
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patch-2.6.19-rc1-kmemleak-0.11.bz2
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/broken-out/patches-kmemleak-0.11.tar.bz2
What's new in this version:
- updated to Linux 2.6.19-rc1
- kmemleak now uses the common API for getting stack traces, making it
  easier to support other architectures
- fixed bug in calculating the page order for the hash allocation
To do:
- testing on a wider range of platforms and configurations
- support for ioremap tracking
- eliminate the task stacks scanning (if possible, by marking the
  allocated blocks as temporary until the return to user-space -
  Ingo's suggestion)
- precise type identification (after first assessing the efficiency of
  the current method as it requires changes to the kernel API)
