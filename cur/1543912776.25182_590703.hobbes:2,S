It's no longer dual licenced in the FreeBSD tree because the FreeBSD 
people removed the GPL choice of the dual licenced code 3 months ago.
So all of Theo's accusations of people breaking the law by making this 
dual licenced code GPL-only apply as well to the FreeBSD people...

Both the FreeBSD and Linux people draw the logical conclusion that this 
"Alternatively" means everyone can always choose to remove one of the 
two choices alternatively offered.
According to Theo, that is "breaking the law"...
