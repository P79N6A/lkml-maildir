Oh. Perhaps the original poster would like to know where. My gcc is
2.7.2.3. Is this stuff in later ones?
Why not the low end ones, BTW? That seems contradictory, or are the higher
end ones more like regular CPUs?

gcc (RTL) is geared for single-stack machines. I'm not familiar with the
general case of RTL. I would be surprised even in the general case if a
"Register Transfer Language" was real useful for a stack machine. If you
have some tips on how to describe a 2 or 3 stack machine in gcc RTL I'd be
real interested, without the l-k cc: 
This leads to the further problem that C makes lousy Forth and vice-versa,
but I won't mention that  :o)
