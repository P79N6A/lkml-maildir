It has all arrived at least once. However you don't know if a
retransmitted packet took a long trip round the world and popped out
later. When that happens you need to be sure you can tell old and new
apart. The TIME_WAIT state is basically "don't use this identical set of
port/address data for long enough to be sure any prior use has exited
the internet in its entirety.

Sockets are two way at the TCP layer. "close" really means "have
finished sending". When both ends have finished sending the connection
is complete but not before. Thus if Mysql daemon says "I am done" but
you have open references to the handle then it will stay open one way
still.
