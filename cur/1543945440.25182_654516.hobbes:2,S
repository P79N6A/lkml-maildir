Sorry ... my response was ambiguous, so not surprisingly you read it
the other way than I intended it and missed my point.
Let me try this again.
Yes, if we drop that MPOL_FLAG_SHIFT, we can't tell if exactly the low
eight bits are valid, -however- we can still tell if the low bits not
used by our MPOL_F_* flag bits are valid, and that's sufficient.
I included a PATCH in my last reply, in order to demonstrate this.

No.
That is not an implementation detail that must be explicitly defined
in order to separate the mode from the flags.
One can separate out the high order flag bits by simply masking them off.

I agree that we must return -EINVAL if the user specifies an invalid
flag.  I have always agreed with this.

    Bingo!!
That's what I've been saying all along.
I'm not quite sure how we got here; this seems to me such a sharp turn
from what went before that I fear I've misread you, but I suppose I
should just be glad we're in agreement, despite the strange journey.
You go on to suggest a couple of variations of this check, by first
masking off the high order flag bits:
	if ((mode & MPOL_MODE_FLAGS) >= MPOL_MAX)
		return -EINVAL;
and then, in a follow-on message, refining that line of thought with:
	unsigned short flags;
	flags = mode & MPOL_MODE_FLAGS;
	mode &= ~MPOL_MODE_FLAGS;
	if (mode < 0 || mode >= MPOL_MAX)
		return -EINVAL;
Actually, I don't think you need to add either variation, as I think you
-already- have that check, in both sys_mbind() and sys_set_mempolicy(),
as the check:
        if (mpol_mode(mode) >= MPOL_MAX)
                return -EINVAL;
With one minor tweak (changing the return type of mpol_mode() from
uchar to ushort), here again is the PATCH of my last reply, with this
check present (actually, it's a check of yours, unchanged from what has
been in your patch for days now).
Does this PATCH do what you have in mind?
