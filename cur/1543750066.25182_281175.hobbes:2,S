The problem as posed is that the dirty memory limits are global, but
ZONE_NORMAL can be overwhelmed by dirty memory. bdev pagecache is as
surely subject to the zone limits as all others, but overwhelms them
and is not pressured because globally the thresholds are not tripped.
The sheer idiocy of physical placement restrictions imposed on behalf
of software is merely what's being exploited to artificially create
such a situation for a testcase and what users are tripping over daily.
