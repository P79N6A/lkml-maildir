Perhaps it would be worthwhile to standardize the printk
task information content? Maybe a format knob?
Maybe TASK_FMT/TASK_ARG(task)
#define TASK_FMT "%s"
#define TASK_ARG(tsk) ({char __buf[MAX_TASK_INFO]; print_task(tsk, buf, sizeof(__buf)); __buf})
char* print_task(const struct task_struct* tsk, char* buf, size_t size)
{
	char* p = buf;
	int task_knob = get_task_knob();
	*p++ = '[';
	if (task_knob & feature)
		p += snprintf(p, size - (p - buf), fmt, feature);
	[...]
	*p++ = ']';
	return buf;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(print_task)
