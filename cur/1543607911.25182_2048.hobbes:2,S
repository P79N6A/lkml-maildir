So every people with faulty CMOS batteries would have 30+ years of
uptime. And if the CMOS date is ahead of the real one and the admin
sets it back, you will get negative uptimes etc. If you want such
amusements, it is far easier to write an uptime program that just calls
random() instead of asking the kernel :)
