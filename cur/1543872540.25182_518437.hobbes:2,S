Good point. I never thought about that and we set the period in the
clock event device itself. You are right, the clockevents layer should
hand over the period either with the set_mode call or seperately.
Probably with the set_mode call, as it is needed exactly there and we
don't want to have a "if (dev->mode == XXX)" check in set_next_event().
I look into this.
