Thanks Peter.
Indeed i assumed my hrtimer callbacks to run in soft-irq. I tried the 
can-bcm protocol with Ingos current linux-2.6-sched-devel.git including 
your patches and i did not see any issues so far. And i do not expect 
any (recursion) problems with hrtimer_forward() in my code either.
But i'm not that familiar with the timer context's stuff, that i would 
like guaranty that the functions i use in bcm_send_user() and in 
bcm_can_tx() are always safe to be used in hard-irq context.
It would be nice, if you could give me some support by double checking 
the correctness of the hard-irq context in the given functions.
Best regards,
Oliver
