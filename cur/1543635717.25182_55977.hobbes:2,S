A version of Alan's strict VM overcommit for the stock VM is available
for 2.4.19-rc1 at:
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/vm/strict-overcommit/2.4/vm-strict-overcommit-rml-2.4.19-rc1-1.patch
This is the same code I posted yesterday (see "[PATCH] strict VM
overcommit for" from 20020711) except for the stock non-rmap VM in 2.4.
Hugh Dickins sent me a few fixes, mostly for shmfs accounting, that he
recently discovered... that code is not yet merged but will be, probably
after this weekend.
I still encourage testing and comments.
