Possibly which case are you trying to prevent?

No.  As long as the code handles that case properly we should be fine.
As a general principle we should be able to keep things from other namespaces
open if we get them.  The chroot or equivalent binary is the one that needs
to ensure these kinds of issues don't exist if we care.
Speaking of we should put together a small test application probably similar
to chroot so people can access these features at least for testing.

Ack.  For the unshare fix below.  Could you resend this one separately with
patch in the subject so Andrew sees it and picks  up?
