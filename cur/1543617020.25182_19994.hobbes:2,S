Looking at init/main.c and fs/super.c,
rootfsflags parameter is never saved, moreover - it's original value is destroyed, once initrd fs is mounted.
And I only see not very nice ways of fixing this, so perhaps someone more exeprienced can come up with the solution?
(my crappy ides is not to do putname() on fs_names, if (real_root_dev != ROOT_DEV), all of this is only when CONFIG_..._INITRD
enabled)

Our internal deecision is now to detect if device, we are going to mkfs have FAT superblock,
and if it is, zero it out.

Do you have vfat as a loadable module?
