This problem can actually lose your mail, if the client reads the
smaller mailbox and writes it back (e.g. to delete a message).  You used
to have about 30 seconds during which this could happen -- very bad.

The problem was noticed a while back, and fixed in 2.1.131.  The file
shows up with a smaller size due to attribute cacheing, but now when
your mail client locks the file using fcntl(F_SETLK), the cache is
flushed and it will see the new data.
So, *if* your mail client use fcntl() to lock the mailbox, in addition
to any other locking it uses, "noac" (can be written "actimeo=0") isn't
necessary since 2.1.131.  I know my mail client does this, but does
yours?
There are still a rare condition w.r.t. overlapping I/O requests
revalidating the cache prematurely.  However the loss window for this is
_much_ smaller (millisecond or so), and even then quite rare.  It will
be closed in a future kernel.
Miquel's assertion is good advice.  But technically, if you _know_ your
mail client calls fcntl() for locking, and you haven't mounted with
"nolock", it is safe to mount your mail spool with the default attribute
cacheing options.  The no-"nolock" restriction will be lifted in future.
