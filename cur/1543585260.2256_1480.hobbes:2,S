I'm applying this to my tree - I'm not exactly comfortable with this
during the 2.4.x timeframe, but at the same time I'm even less comfortable
with the current alternative, which is to make the regular semaphores
fairer (we tried it once, and the implementation had problems, I'm not
going to try that again during 2.4.x).
Besides, the fair semaphores would potentially slow things down, while
this potentially speeds things up. So.. It looks obvious enough.
