Virtual memory fixes physical memory fragmentation only. I.e. you can `glue'
multiple physical chunks together into one large virtual chunk.
Biut you're still limited to a 32-bit virtual address space (3 GB in user
space). If this virtual 3 GB gets fragmented, you're still out of luck.
To check this, print all allocated virtual addresses, or look at
/proc/<pid>/maps, and see why it fails.
