Looks good to me.
You're using `head' as "the place from which `get' gets characters" and
you're using `tail' as "the place where `put' puts characters".  So the
FIFO is, logically:
          tail            head
    * ->  ********************   -> *
     put                         get
I've always done it the other way: you put stuff onto the head and take
stuff off the tail.  Now I have a horid feeling that I've always been
arse-about.  hrm.
