I don't think you can specify the addresses. It looks at the interfaces
and sends to the ones that can broadcast.
I have solved it with ipchains but then rwhod fills my /var/log/messages
with lines like:
Nov 1 20:40:28 x rwhod[650]: sendto(192.168.0.1): Operation not permitted
Nov 1 20:43:28 x rwhod[650]: sendto(192.168.0.1): Operation not permitted
Nov 1 20:46:28 x rwhod[650]: sendto(192.168.0.1): Operation not permitted
It's a lot of messages...
So if you cant turn of broadcast why does ifconfig have an option that
says it turns of broadcast.
 [-]broadcast [addr]
    If the address  argument  is  given,  set  the  protocol broadcast
    address   for  this  interface.   Otherwise,  set  (or clear)  the
    IFF_BROADCAST flag for the interface.
And rwhod looks at the IFF_BROADCAST flag.
