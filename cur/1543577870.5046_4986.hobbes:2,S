I doubt if that would help.
I claim no expertise in this area, but perhaps we can
get some protocol gurus interested.
To recap:
You're sending and receiving FTP/TCP/IP4 to Solaris and AIX hosts
You have a 1000kbyte window size
You have an 80 megabit/sec pipe.
You're getting 1.8 megabits/sec.
What is the round-trip time on the WAN?
Packet loss?
Does the problem occur in both directions?
Are you _sure_ the window size is being set correctly? How
is it being set?
Are you able to generate TCP dumps when the problem is happening?
