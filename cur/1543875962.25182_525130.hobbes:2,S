Hi,
	I agree with that, there seems to be lot of code duplication between i386 and x86_64.
	By the way, x86_64 does take care of suspend/resume for hpet, it is done by 
	linux-2.6/arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:timer_resume(struct sys_device *dev):
		hpet_reenable()
	on i386 PIT driver goes out of way when HPET is detected
	So it seems that there is lot of work to do to remove redundant code.
	Best regards,
		Maxim Levitsky
