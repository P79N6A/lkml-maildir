yup.  Another arbitrary number (the rate of HZ on Alpha, btw).
In the Alpha case, we did some experiments at the time we went to the 
new architecture to see how much overhead running at a higher rate would 
cost; we made sure it was less than 1% on the slowest Alpha that would 
ever exist....  Along comes Linux years later, and there have been some 
schedular related performance problems recently uncovered as a result 
due to the simplicity (stupidity?) of the Linux scheduler, but I've seen
no reason to regret this so far (the Linux schedular problems are generic:
they just show up 10 times as often at 1000hz).
Arguing that the interrupt load at 1000hz is significant on today's
processor is specious.
