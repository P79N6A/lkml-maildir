Subject: [GIT PATCHES] kbuild: full dependency check on asm-offset.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[Seems that first attempt sending out this patchset went wrong..]
The following 12 patches introduces full dependency tracking on the
generated asm-offsets.h file.
It also consolidate the rules required to build the asm-offsets.h file
in a new file named Kbuild in the top-level directory.
Introducing this consolidated method called for a consistent naming of
the file across all architectures, therefore this patchset touches a lot
of .S files all over the place but with trivial changes only.
A few architectures did not use asm-offsets.h so they got a dymmy
asm-offsets.c file - to remind them and to avoid breaking the build.
The concept was presented at linux-arch yesterday with no objections
and I request it to be applied to 2.6.14.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/kbuild.git
I will try to follow-up on this mail with the patches to lkml.
	Sam
