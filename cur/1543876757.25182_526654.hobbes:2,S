This isn't good for me, since it then drops some output I want to save
via the serial console to the regular console.  It would be nice if
all output went to BOTH consoles, though input should only be accepted
on the first console listed.

Sure, but I want the serial console to be the preferred console for
output, so I can capture it all.  But this is still a good idea and
I'll test it out and see if GDM still has a problem with it like
that.  I suspect not, but we'll see.
THanks for the suggestion,
John
