Well, too me it seems that you are intolerant.
I think that it should not be added to kernel because:
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/perl^M
will write
--
: No such file or directory
--
(in real it writes '/usr/bin/perl<CR>: No such file or directory')
But what I do think is that more meaningful message should be printed to
output, because it is not only ^M issue.  You could mistype name of
interpreter and don't notice (/usr/bin/eprl or similar typos), and printing
message saying 'script.pl: file not found' is confusing.
I see problem somewhere else.  There are editors and viewers (for example
midnight commander) which will hide ^M from you, and left you totally
confused (that's why I am using emacs ;-), because you have no idea why it
doesn't work, because everything seems ok with this _broken_ behaviour.
This is really BAD thing.
And even more BAD thing is the intolerance shown in this thread.  People
are not morons just because they don't understand confusing message which
shell gives them.  Behaviour of kernel is good, error message is wrong.
What should be fixed is error message.
