In the busy case, yes.  But on an idle system you get tickless behaviour.
It's still going to be load-sensitive, since you are doing additional work to 
keep track of the timer/timeout values.  But it saves work if reprogramming the 
timer is time-consuming compared to simply reading it.  On something like the 
ppc, it probably doesn't buy you much since the decrementer is cheap to program.
