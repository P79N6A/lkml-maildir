Ok, this is a new opinion, because it voids the "using the published
module ABI is unconditionally ok as stated again and again.

And this would void DaveMs' argument, that only the "official in
Linus' kernel published interface is allowed for binary modules". This
would mean, that putting the posted, unofficial patch under GPL into
the kernel and then using this interface for a binary module is just
the same as using only the official ABI from a lawyers' point of
view! 
This would make DaveMs' position even less understandable, because
there would be no difference for a proprietary vendor but keeping the
patch out of the kernel makes life harder for people like the original
poster that want to test new (open sourced) protocols like SCTP.

Ugh, this is a sentence we're bound to read out of context on ZDNet
and m$.com... =:-( (Linux head developer warns companies to do risk
assessment before releasing drivers for Linux... Film at 11.)
