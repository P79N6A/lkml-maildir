Well, you could always have 
   sbi = new(GPF_KERNEL) SuperBlock;
And CodingStyle was written for C.
Just to make a thing clear: I'm not advocating to include C++ support in
current kernel. I just say that the only valid argument is that
'KERNEL IS C', and interfacing C with C++ just would add bloat and errors.
There is no technical argument to reject to write an OS kernel in C++.
It would not be slower not more complicated, and it will be probably safer
because it leaves less things (from thost you always _must_ do) to
programmers memories.
