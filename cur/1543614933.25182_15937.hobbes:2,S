Indeed... This fix would be right in any case.
I want to remind why this check is made: this pointer must not show
to heavens and it must not be NULL. This property was not held in the past,
hence this bug trap was inserted. It can be relaxed, provided it preserves
its sanitizing function.
Also, note that real value of nh.raw is private to protocol.
Particularly, it can be equal to mac.raw. The best thing to do is
to set it to the same position as it would have if the same packet
appeared on input. But it is not an absolute requirement,
as soon as raw packet socket cannot hold it.
