	Hello,
	I would like to know if the current kernel supports the 
Tekram DC390U4W SCSI adapter, it includes a LSI 53C1030 chip
(
http://www.tekram.com.cn:8060/ProductSpec.Asp?Product=DC-390U4B_U4W
).
After grep through the drivers/ directory of the kernel source I found
nothing referent to this chip, does it mean it isn't supported? If it
isn't supported, is there any plan to support it?
	Best regards,
	- german
