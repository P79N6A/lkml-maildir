Does the IDE subsystem always know where it sits? I.e. does it know that a 
particular IDE controller is a function of the south bridge, an add-on PCI 
card, or directly on the motherboard?
If it does, there is no problem. It can properly add itself in the correct 
hierarchial position. 
If it doesn't, it's still not much of a problem (at least not at first 
glance).
If the IDE controller doesn't know it's parent, create an 'ide' bus as a 
child of the root and put ide devices under it. If there are multiple 
controllers or channels, represent them accordingly.
