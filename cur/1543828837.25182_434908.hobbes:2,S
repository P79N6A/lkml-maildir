In my current Xen patch, I split the mach-default/setup.c into setup.c 
and setup-memory.c; Xen uses setup.c as-is, and then provides its own 
setup-xen.c.  That solves my immediate problem, but I don't know if it 
generalizes enough; certainly factoring default/setup.c into a cluster 
of reusable setup-*.c pieces is a pretty lightweight way of reusing 
those pieces.
