OK.  I just got the OK from management.  The system we were booting was
for research only.  We had NR_CPUS=num_online_cpus()=4096 which were
non-hyperthreaded.  With no attached I/O and the tweak I originally
posted plus one change Jack has already gotten accepted, the machine
booted in approx 12 minutes.
Thanks,
Robin
