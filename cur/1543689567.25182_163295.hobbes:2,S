This an interesting tidbit, as I'm busy working on a DFS mmap for OpenGFS, and 
I want to be sure I'm implementing true-blue Posix semantics.  But trawling 
through the Posix/SUS specification at:
   
http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/online.html
all it says is that for MAP_SHARED "write references shall change the 
underlying object."  I don't see anything about when those changes become 
visible to other mappers, much less any discussion of local caching.  Am I 
looking at the wrong document?
Regards,
Daniel
