Let's go through this again.
1) I don't understand what you want.  eg. for USB devices, they're
   used to match the USB device to the USB driver for autoloading.
   You seemed surprised when I suggested you could autoload the input
   drivers: but what else would you want this information for?
2) While a naive approach to aliases would make aliases for input
   drivers about 1000 chars long, that's just a good reason not to use
   a naive approach.  I already suggested one approach based on the
   looking at the current drivers in the tree.
3) Since we're talking about 5 drivers in all, you could simply
   hardcode them if this is all too much trouble for you.
4) You *have* been informed that this is changing, months ago.  As
   soon as Greg tells me that hotplug scripts no longer need those
   tables, they will be removed in favour of the aliases which exist.
5) If you want some tables for other reasons, there's no reason for
   you not to generate them yourself.  Experience has shown that this
   method is fragile, but that's your choice.
6) You're confused about external modules: the module supplier runs
   file2alias as part of the build process, the user runs depmod as
   normal, so no problems.

But they are *distributed separately*, so for the end user, it's much
harder to keep them in sync.  That's been one of the main aims of the
new module code: kernel independence.
Rusty.
