The type of allocation determines what pool memory is allocated from.  Ie
nonpagable kernel allocations come from one zone, atomic allocations from
another and user from yet another.  It's basically the same thing that the
slab does, except for pages.  The key advantage is that allocations of
different types are not mixed, so the lifetime of allocations in the same
zone tends to be similar and fragmentation tends to be lower.
