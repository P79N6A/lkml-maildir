Well, I'm not a janitor, but this patch tickled my fancy enough to 
apply it just for grins, and there is now a wide one here at the 
Heskett digs.  Running 2.6.9-rc2-mm2 without this patch, my glxgears 
speeds are fixed +- a half a frame a second from 10 fps.  Thats real 
exciting, like watching grass grow or paint dry.
However, after applying this patch only, my glxgears performance is 
looking up a bit, as follows:
root@coyote root]# glxgears
1254 frames in 5.0 seconds = 250.800 FPS
1260 frames in 5.0 seconds = 252.000 FPS
1276 frames in 5.0 seconds = 255.200 FPS
1260 frames in 5.0 seconds = 252.000 FPS
1260 frames in 5.0 seconds = 252.000 FPS
1134 frames in 5.0 seconds = 226.800 FPS
1260 frames in 5.0 seconds = 252.000 FPS
1262 frames in 5.0 seconds = 252.400 FPS
1182 frames in 5.0 seconds = 236.400 FPS
1260 frames in 5.0 seconds = 252.000 FPS
1134 frames in 5.0 seconds = 226.800 FPS
1260 frames in 5.0 seconds = 252.000 FPS
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
The 2 stumbles visible were probably kmail related.
And the exit message when clicking on it to close it is changed from 
the former "Broken pipe" to the above, so there is a side effect of 
this 2 line patch observed here.
Humm, another effect I just noticed, tvtime had a just barely 
noticeable stutter, frame skips I think, that was much worse when 
running the unpatched rc2-mm2.  They seem to be gone, its as smooth 
as the hubble mirror at the moment.
I don't know what other side efects this particular patch might have 
but it sure seems like its all plus for this user.

Nice catch guys.
