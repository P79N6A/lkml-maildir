Not going to complain about it loudly. I like playing with these old 
drives, but the drivers are so immensely broken that they don't seem to 
serve a very useful purpose anymore; even if I, or someone else, would 
ever get around to try and revive this hardware under Linux; the current 
state of these drivers seems to imply we'd be better of starting from 
scratch.
And even more so since I expect that any new attempts should do the "no 
really, I'm a scsi drive" thing that most anything else is doing these 
days. Using a different infrastructure like that would, I presume, mean 
that really only the hardware details would remain useful from the old 
drivers, and those will be present inside linux-2.6.22.tar.gz same as 
before.
Having said that, it would still be good to have mcdx functional so 
please don't let me keep you, Pekka, or anyone else from looking :-)
With a bit of luck sbpcd and cdu31a (and cm206 as the other controller 
that I have) will be similarly broken and having an example in mcdx will 
be useful whatever happens to the drivers in the upstream tree...

That's not true though... I just checked and they all compile on 
2.6.20.4. sbpcd and cm206 with cli/sti warnings, the others without even.
