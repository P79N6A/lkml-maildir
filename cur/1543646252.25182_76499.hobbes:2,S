It's completely useless - any code that actually relies on its value is
racy, since there's nothing to prevent bd_claim() from being called
just as we drop bdev_lock.
The same applies to original version - if you want to protect some area,
use bd_claim() and don't release it until you are out of critical area,
damnit.
