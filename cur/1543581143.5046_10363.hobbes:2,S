SCSI does not build a request bigger than the low level driver
can handle. If you exceed the scatter count in a single request,
you just stop and fire of that request, later on restarting I/O
on the remainder.

Yes. Which is why dealing with buffer heads are so nice in this
regard, you never have problems with ending I/O on a single "piece".

There's a slight benefit in building bigger requests than the driver
can handle, in that you can have more I/O pending on the queue. It's
not worth spending too much time on though.
