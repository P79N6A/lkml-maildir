I am using iget to find inodes in the NFS code. 
My problem is that if the inode is not active iget() still
returns a pointer.  But an iput() then gives:
Feb 28 15:28:51 harpo kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device 16:07): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for block 82191
Feb 28 15:28:51 harpo kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device 16:07): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for inode 20409
Is this just over-agressive logging?
