Ok, CC'ing Richard as I should've done in the first place...

Perhaps.  Richard informs me that this might be incorrect.  Richard,
would you care to clarify exactly what the ACR register value
contains?  It sounds like we can't get uAh without taking two reads over
time and computing them.
Bonus points if one of us remembers to update
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Ec_specification
 with the information. :)
The code snippet above is mangled due to wrapping.  It was originally:
-#define EC_BAT_ACR     0x12
+#define EC_BAT_ACR     0x12    /* int16_t,     *416.667,    µAh  */

We have logic in userspace that converts ACR to a useful number; for
our purposes, we'd just like to read the raw ACR values.
Perhaps CHARGE_NOW is the wrong thing to be using, if we can't get
uAh and CHARGE_* requires that unit.
