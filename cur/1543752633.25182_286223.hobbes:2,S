Subject: [PATCH] reintroduce EXPORT_SYMBOL(task_nice) for binfmt_elf32
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Building an s390x kernel with binfmt_elf32 as a module, I get the following 
errors: 
*** Warning: "task_nice" [arch/s390/kernel/binfmt_elf32.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "arch_pick_mmap_layout" [arch/s390/kernel/binfmt_elf32.ko] 
undefined!
IIRC 2.6.8 did not show this problem. Therefore I suggest to revert the 
removal of the EXPORT_SYMBOL(task_nice). The rationale for removing the 
export was the fact, that binfmt_elf is no longer modular. Unfortunately 
that is not true in the emulation case on s390 and (untested) sparc64. 
If there are no objections, please apply.
