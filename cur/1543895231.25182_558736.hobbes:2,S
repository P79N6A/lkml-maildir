I don't. I was *REPEATING* an example of how TiVO has a *RIGHT* to change the 
kernel or any other facet of the device connecting to their network. That 
right *ISN'T* tied to copyright - as you have stated. Since it isn't, why is 
the FSF trying to mandate that it is with the tivoization clauses in GPLv3?

Nope. Because that isn't a right they have that is disconnected from copyright 
law. Or did you not read the entire post and just decide to try and make me 
look stupid?

At no point have I claimed to know how TiVO was accomplishing the "connection 
to the service" or how they were handling the signing of the kernel. If the 
final binary is altered by the signing process then, IMHO, the signed kernel 
and everything involved in creating it constitutes a "derived work".
My argument is that, as much as people want it to be different, in mandating 
that people give up rights that are (potentially) disconnected from the 
copyright - in order to "Defend the Four Freedoms" and keep "all users of the 
licensed work equal in their freedoms" - the GPLv3 is flawed and potentially 
unenforceable.
