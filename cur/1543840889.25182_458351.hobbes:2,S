Consider the following simple scenario: there are 50 containers 
(numbered, say, 1 to 50) all sharing a single installation of Fedora 
Core 5. They all run sshd, apache, syslogd, crond and some other stuff 
like that. This is actually quite a real scenario.
In the world that you propose the container which was unlucky to start 
first (probably the one with ID of either 1 or 50) will be charged for 
all the memory, and all the
others will have most of their memory for free. And in such a world 
per-container memory accounting or limiting is just not possible.
