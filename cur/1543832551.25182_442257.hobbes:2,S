2.6.18-rc1-git1-64-smp cpu freq ondemand governor problem 
on dual core amd 64bit system 
 - start 2 proceses with infinite loop in each - OK both cores 100% 
utilization cpu speed max
 - kill one - BAD now one core utilization 90-100% but cpu speed fluctuating 
from min to max depending on system activity 
any posibility to setup ondemand governor for max speed if only 1 processor 
utilization is maxed - full speed for single process/thread activity ?
