Yes. The packet counters tell that the data was received by the interface. 
However, the interface may be faster than the application that ultimately 
receives the data so that the kernel eventually runs out of buffers used to 
store the temporary data. When this happens, the kernel just drops them. 
Since UDP is not "reliable", it can't ask the sender to send them again when 
it has resources available. If you need all the data, use a TCP/IP stream 
protocol, in other words, a connection. That way, you will get all the data, 
even if you are writing it to a slow disk.
