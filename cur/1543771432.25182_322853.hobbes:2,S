readl/writel just won't work.  They are byte swapped on PPC since
they are specifically for PCI access.  In other "on-chip" drivers
for PPC32, we typically ioremap() to a non-volatile type and then
use out_be32()/in_be32() since everything except PCI on PPC is
in right-endian (big endian) form. out_be*()/in_be*() contain
an eieio instruction to guarantee proper ordering.
I know this driver was recently rewritten but the authors may have
missed the past threads about why volatile use is discouraged.  We
do something similar with register overlay structures in
drivers/net/ibm_emac. However, we don't use a volatile type and do
use PPC32-specific (these are PPC-specific drivers anyway)
out_be32()/in_be32() for correctness.
