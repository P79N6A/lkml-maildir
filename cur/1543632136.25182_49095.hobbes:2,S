	I addressed that previously: you can license just the case
where the entire program is free software.  Patents restrict use, not
just copying.  So, it is hard to argue against the enforceability of
"user does the link" subversion when it comes to patents, which I
infer is your principal objection.

	Linux distribution vendors make a lot of money from combining
and selling the work of these other free software development
communities.  These other communities currently do a lot of work to
ensure that their software runs under our GPL'ed kernel and LGPL'ed C
library.  The GPL developers are supported in the other direction too:
plenty of GPL'ed software runs under BSD-permission platforms like
tcl, or Apache or on BSD.  Even with the Linux kernel, you have Dave
Hinds relicensing his MPL pcmcia drivers for GPL linking, and sixty
two modules in linux-2.5.18 contain MODULE_LICENSE declarations of
"Dual BSD/GPL", plus two others that are just BSD.
	You would have no Linux distribution if you only shipped
GPL'ed software, or even if the non-GPL free software communities
stopped their continuing substantial efforts to ensure that their
applications run Linux, compile under GCC and binutils, and
interoperate with a host of other GPL'ed components.
	What more should the non-GPL free software communities have
done that now justifies your not licensing your patents for their free
software development?

	If you "extend lists of licenses" _at the outset_, you will
discourage patenting of the non-GPL software you use.  Otherwise, I
think the practice will quickly proliferate if other free software
companies see that their users and contributors tolerate Red Hat
taking out patents on free software implementations and licensing it
GPL-only.  I think subsequent extensions would have less of of a
standards setting effect.
