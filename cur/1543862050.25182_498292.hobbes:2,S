Good point.  The original Attansic driver had a whole bunch of legacy 
compat crap, documentation build targets left over from e1000, etc. 
which we've been modifying and mostly just removing.  We don't really 
need this for merging.  If Attansic wants to maintain something out of 
tree for legacy kernels, they might want to reinsert this, but we really 
don't need it.
Thanks for pointing this out.
