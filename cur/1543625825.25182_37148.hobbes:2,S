Yes. I don't have this problem. I am a mobile user of this driver
(hotplug and power-management) and the driver was done with other things
in mind. The good thing is that both views seems to converge today.
I am looking for a clean fix. As I see it, the vector of options is a
mistake. We should be able to give a default value for an option with
modutils but for more complicate configuration a userland tool should be
able to decide the correct options for a given device. This is a
generalisation to what hotplug does.

Yes I remember even if I am not yet convinced.

I will have a look. Thanks.

So this particular problem is not solved in the usb drivers ?
