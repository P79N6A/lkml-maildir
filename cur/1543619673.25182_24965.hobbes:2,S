+In many countries, any equipment which is connected to the public 
+telephone networks must be tested and approved to ensure it behaves
+correctly. This requirement also extends to the software used to 
+implement the ISDN protocols with passive ISDN cards.
+<BR>
+The HiSax driver has passed these tests and been approved, but any
+modifications to the source mean that the approval process must be
+repeated. The md5sum checks are therefore present to indicate the 
+current approval status of the HiSax driver. An md5sum failure does
+not mean that your kernel download is corrupted; merely that someone
+has changed the source code since the last time it was certified and
+the md5sums of the approved files updated. 
+<BR>
+It's rumoured that the requirement for certification of ISDN software
+is being relaxed in many countries, so this approval process is
+unnecessary. You should check for yourself the status of such rules in
+your country. Certainly, I've never heard of anyone actually getting 
+prosecuted or otherwise reprimanded for using a modified Linux ISDN stack.
