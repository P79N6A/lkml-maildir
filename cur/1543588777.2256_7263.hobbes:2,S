Hi Dale,
	The preferred patch is available, and has been tested (several
new testsuite tests now exist) and submitted to Linus (et. al):
	
http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/security-fix/ftp-security2.patch
	
http://netfilter.samba.org/security-fix/ftp-security2.patch
	
http://netfilter.gnumonks.org/security-fix/ftp-security2.patch
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
