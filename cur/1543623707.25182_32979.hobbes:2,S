No. Try:
"You're whining, here's how fix it, because I don't have time or
motivation"
Larry went to a lot of trouble to listen to what kernel developers 
wanted, and a lot of work to implement some of it. I expect same courtesy 
of everyone who is complaining.
I am not expecting any 'enhancements to bitkeeper'.. that is Larry's job.

If Larry can make good on his 'threat' to write a read-only cvs pserver 
interface to BK, I think he's done his part. (BK -> $OTHER_SCM)
Then I'd really like to see scripts to make it easy to go from
$YOUR_FAVORITE_SCM -> patch -> BK, while keeping important metadata, like,
oh, say, comments. The patch->BK part is already done. It's up to the
other 'side' now to get changes from $YOUR_FAVORITE_SCM into BK without
either losing lots of information, or taking lots of time.
Various people have probably already done all of this. Now can someone 
bother to spend some time to find the best methods for this and integrate
it into a nice 'packaged' setup? (along with a 'HOWTO')
