Could someone please explain the reason that this error would occur? I
mean the root of the problem ie. what really causes it in the kernel?
And then some common laymen reasons that it might be showing up on 2 of
my machines that I use as routers?
I have searched deja.com and found a few suggestions but nothing seemed
to do any good.
I get the same message on 2 machines of 3 that have had kernels 2.2.17,
2.2.18, and 2.4.1 on them - no matter what kernel I get the error. I
have also tried playing musical network cards but no help there either.
Thanks in advance.
