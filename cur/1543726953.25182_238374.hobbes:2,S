The full logfiles can be downloaded from:
http://www.cc.jyu.fi/~ptsjohol/syslog1.gz
 
http://www.cc.jyu.fi/~ptsjohol/syslog2.gz
 
The first log file is with both patchs applied and the second one with one 
little change to rx8139_rx() to show if it even goes to through 
"        while (netif_running(dev) && received < budget
               && (RTL_R8 (ChipCmd) & RxBufEmpty) == 0) {"-section.
This was the change which I made.. so you can see in the second log file 
that there won't be any of these messages after the driver has crashed. 
/*              if (netif_msg_rx_status(tp))*/
        printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s:  rtl8139_rx() status %4.4x, size %4.4x,"
        " cur %4.4x.\n", dev->name, rx_status, rx_size, cur_rx);
For the first logfile the exact crash time is "13:02:22" and the for the 
second one it is "14:54:49".

I took out those "exiting with interrupt"-messages.
