How many people really use clone() directly (as opposed to indirectly through
libc)? Yet there's a clone(2) man page. Actually, why not drop the vfork(2)
man page and add the description of the CLONE_VFORK flag in clone(2). That
might have the psychological effect you're aiming for.
People who want to write high-performance Linux-only stuff should have _some_
documentation to turn to.
