With ix86 machines, the page directory pointed to by CR3 needs
to always be present in physical memory. This means that there
must always be some RAM that can't be hot-swapped (you can't
put back the contents of the page-directory without using
the CPU which needs the page directory).
This is explained on page 5-21 of the i486 reference manual.
This happens because there is no "present" bit in CR3 as there
are in the page tables themselves.
This problem means that "surprise" swaps are impossible. However,
given a forewarning, it is possible to build a new table somewhere
in existing RAM within the physical constraints required, call
some code there (needs to be a 1:1 translation), disable paging,
then proceed. The problem is that of writing of the contents
of RAM to be replaced, to storage media so the new page-table
needs to be loaded from the new location. This may not work
if the LDT and the GDT are not accessible from their current
locations. If they are in the RAM to be replaced, you are
in a world of hurt taking the "world" apart and putting it
back together again.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
