What for? The kernel is compressed and unzips itself on boot, which exact
compression mechanism is used is completely irrelevant to the booter, so it
has no place in the name.
Also, bzip2 is not used because it needs around 1MiB for buffers when
uncompressing, RAM which just isn't there when booting (it has to work in
the mythical PC 640KiB, IIRC). Or am I missing something here?
