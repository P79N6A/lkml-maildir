"BK format"?  Not really.  Patches have been posted (to lkml, even) to 
GNU CSSC which allow it to read SCCS files BK reads and writes.
Since that already exists, a full BitKeeper clone is IMO a bit silly, 
because it draws users and programmers away from projects that could 
potentially _replace_ BitKeeper.
