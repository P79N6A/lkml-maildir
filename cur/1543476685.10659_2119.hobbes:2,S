> >> to qualify a new hardware platform that use a VIA VPX based motherboard
There has been a lot of talk, here and there, of VIA chipsets not getting along
with the Tulip driver and I'd almost guess it might be somewhat related to the
ISA DMA bug, even though the the card is PCI. The VPX chipset boards didn't
stick around too long if I remember correctly and I remember people having
oodles of trouble with them.
You might want to try yanking everything out and just trying a different
motherboard with the rest of your hardware, although that might not be possible
and/or feasible.
