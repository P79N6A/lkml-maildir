Because:
1. Kprobes are more overhead when they *are* being used.
2. You can get zero overhead by CONFIG'ing things out.
3. (most importantly) it's a bitch to maintain tracepoints out
    of-tree on a rapidly moving kernel
4. I believe kprobes still doesn't have full access to local variables.
Now (3) is possibly solvable by putting the points in as no-ops (either
insert a few nops or just a marker entry in the symbol table?), but full
dynamic just isn't sustainable. What would be really nice is one trace
infrastructure, that allowed both static and dynamic tracepoints without
all the awk-style language crap that seems to come with systemtap.
