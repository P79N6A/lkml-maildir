Hi,
I'm looking for a way to connect multiple linux systems into one big 
machine (server-farm) and I can't find any way of enabling it in kernel. 
  Is this feature supported? If not, how can I build cluster from, let's 
say, 5 machines (I'm interestied in sharing of processes, memory, disk 
space and network interface). Thanks for replies.
