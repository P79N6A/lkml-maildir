So define a level 0 that doesn't prepend any level to the string, and have the 
macro filter that out at the same default level it counts as now.  
(KERN_INFO, I think?)  The tests are all on contants which should resolve at 
compile time and the dead code eliminator should zap it, even if the macro 
gets more complicated it shouldn't result in a bigger binary.

Because we never change kernel internal APIs.  Oh yeah.  Never happens.

Let me get this straight: you're objecting to actually making the printk 
levels useful enough that developers start to care what they're set to, 
because then they might be motivated to want some of them changed?
Make it useful, people might care, thus they might talk about it...
Sorry, I'm still missing the downside here.

That's the main reason I haven't played with it so far, although it would be 
easy to define a new symbol (dprintk or some such, although I note several 
drivers are already using that) and transition gradually.

*Shrug*.
My problem is that switching off printk is the single biggest bloat cutter in 
the kernel, yet it makes the resulting system very hard to support.  It 
combines a big upside with a big downside, and I'd like something in between.

But ignore_loglevel doesn't decrease the size of the _binary_.  That's what 
we're talking about here with the -tiny tree.  Embedded developers want to 
squeeze more code onto smaller flash/rom chips.  Setting ignore_loglevel does 
prevent these messages from ever being emitted, but they're still in the 
kernel image as dead weight.  It saves noise but doesn't save _space_.
I'm proposing allowing an ignore_loglevel to remove the unused messages at 
compile time so they don't take up space.  Doing that requires the levels to 
be integers so they can be compared with < or >, and the remaining changes 
follow logically.  (To me, anyway...)
