Some assorted boot messages from 2.2.0-pre3 (same in pre4 IIANM):
PIIX3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
what does this mean?
....
ide2: ports already in use, skipping probe
what's this mean?
*******************
biggie!
hdb: (U)DMA capability is broken for WDC AC33100H
hdb: DMA disabled
What's this mean?  I don't remember seeing such a thing in
earlier kernels.....  drive seems to work fine when mounted....
*******************
..................
annoying little one, isn't it?:
swapon: can't load library 'libc.so.5'
I suspect maybe the drive's not mounted yet, but I can't figure
out why swapon wants/needs libc.so.5....  just about everything
on the system (RH 5.1) is glibc2.0.7/libc6
~> /sbin/swapon --version
swapon: mount-2.7l
