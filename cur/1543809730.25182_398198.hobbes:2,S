No wonder they do. Extra bits are not a problem, but for 8250.c we need some
way to glue subdrivers with serial8250_set_termios(). Callback in uart_port
structure ?

Common way to use plain 16550 for RS485 is to wire transiever to the RTS
and force userspace to use RTS/CTS flow control. I doubt there are many 
other sane way to do it.

But it will need a way to pass ACR value anyway :)
