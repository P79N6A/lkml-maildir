The basic problem is that one needs a number of bits (at least 16) for 
normalization, which limits the time range one can work with. This means 
that 32 bit leaves only room for 1 millisecond resolution, the remainder 
could maybe saved and reused later.
So AFAICT using micro- or nanosecond resolution doesn't make much 
computational difference.
bye, Roman
