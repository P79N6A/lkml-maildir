Its not actually the interrupt handler which calls the schedule()
function, rather interrupt handler just perform the minimal task, like
copying the data from network card buffer to kernel buffer in case of
packet arriving on system. Its the other function which actually
interrut handler schedules for later invocation and this later
invocation is done in process context and so the function scheduled
for later invocation can wake the waiting processes and can call
schedule() function if needed.
I hope I am not wrong ;-)
