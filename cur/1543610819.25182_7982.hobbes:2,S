Raid has been in quite a shocking state for a long while and
often there seems nor rhyme nor reason to its behaviour. If you want
to stick your machine in an endless loop, just try initialising a
mirror raid device with only one of its two components currently
working.

ya, ya. Try raidhotsetfaulty for good luck and then try raidhotremove.
(curse, splutter. Will the authors ever write some docs that make
sense. And also document the interactions with lvm).

You just said you couldn't?

You ain't kidding. It's a nightmare to test upon.

That's a standard setup. It's not even confusing to me! Try it over lvm
logical partitions and other raid devices (snicker).
