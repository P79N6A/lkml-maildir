Yeah, that is true. As I said, the only way (I seen) is to cast the pointer from
the boolean variable to something else and change the value on that address. But
it would be neat if the compiler said something when inserting somthing else
then (or equal to) 0 and 1.
Right now it is happy with:
_Bool a = "Hello world";
Well, better go to bed while I still remember where it is.
Good night
