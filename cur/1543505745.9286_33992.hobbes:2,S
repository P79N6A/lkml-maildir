	Wow, thank you for all the responses.  I slept on the problem, and 
right after I woke up, I managed to find the solution.  I'm emberassed to
say it was as simple as reducing the overclocking.  I had the Celeron 433A
running at 85MHz bus (553MHz int).
	For that one guy that had the same problem as me, I'd suggest to
you to turn off unmask_irq (it's evil and corrupts data), and to make sure
you follow each of the points listed in Charles Cazabon's post.
	Thank you once again!
