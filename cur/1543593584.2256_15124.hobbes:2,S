There's no IO being done whatsoever (that I can see with only a blinky).
I can fire up ktrace and find out exactly what's going on if that would
be helpful.  Eating the dead swap pages from the active page list prior
to swapoff cures all but a short freeze.  Eating the rest (few of those)
might cure the rest, but I doubt it.
