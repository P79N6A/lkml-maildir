This patch is wrong.
ELF_PAGEALIGN rounds up to the end of the page, not down to the start
of the page.  If elf_bss is in the middle of a page, set_brk allocates
any additional pages after the one already allocated.  elf_bss is the
start of the area that needs to be zero initialized, elf_brk is its
end.  So if elf_bss != elf_brk then there's garbage mapped in BSS
from the file and if you don't clear it some of your zero-initialized
variables won't be zero initialized at all.
In the linked message, set_brk is passed elf_bss so its actual
arguments are set_brk (0xa3801, 0x000a4ec8).  It should map one
page.  0xa3801 should be an already mapped page, and clear_user should
succeed in clearing it.
