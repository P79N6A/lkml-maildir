That sounds very fragile.  It would be better to extend the bootparams 
to contain that information.

2MB for x86, I think.  But that's not really an issue if you use a 
P(seudo-physical) to M(achine) mapping, since you can choose any 
arrangement you like for the kernel.  The only restriction is that you 
can't use large pages any more, but I don't think that's an issue for a 
dump/hibernation kernel.

Well, the traditional framebuffer/ISA space between 640k and 1M probably 
needs to be identity mapped, but I don't think there's anything in there 
which specifically needs to be save/restored (except framebuffer 
contents, maybe?).

Yes, I suppose.  You're certain the old kernel's devices are completely 
quiescent at that point?
