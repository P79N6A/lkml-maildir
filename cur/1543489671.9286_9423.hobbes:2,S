Ok, finally i can compile ksymoops, the problem now is how can i get oops file, becuse the description that i send some days ago i copied manually, so, i don't know how can i get it.
After read all teh file documentation of ksymoops i still don't understand what ksymoops do, so please can anybody explain me what it do, and also i suppouse that once i have oops file what i have to do is ksymoops < oops.file, but is this correct ??
Thank your for your help,
	Ramon
