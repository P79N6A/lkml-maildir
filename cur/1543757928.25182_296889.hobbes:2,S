In the cases such as you describe where it's just some sort of empty
function call, then yes, I am willing to accept a wave of the hands and
a simple explanation of how it's not significant.  I've done the same
myself ;).
What about the case where accounting is enabled, and thus actually has
to do work?
How does that compare with just doing the traditional BSD accounting?
I presume in that case that the benchmarking is no longer irrelevant.
Though if you can make a decent case that it is, I'm willing to listen.
