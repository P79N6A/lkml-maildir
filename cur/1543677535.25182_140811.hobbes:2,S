I now realize, that locking is out of the question. Also, it has been 
suggested to use per cpu stats and overflow into a global counter. (Thanks 
Zwane) This might be a better idea - the problem is, the counter won't be 
100% accurate at all times. The degree of inaccuracy will vary with the 
threshold value. On the other hand, if the threshold is relatively low, no 
one will notice the difference these days.
Jeff.
