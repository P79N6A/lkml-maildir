Exactly, and the current Kconfig assumes that all NUMA systems are
configured with SMP. But that does not have to be the case, especially
with NUMA_EMU.
Depending on SMP only is wrong IMO because CPUSETS manages both sets
of cpus (SMP) and sets of mems (NUMA).
So CPUSETS should either depend on SMP || NUMA or nothing.
