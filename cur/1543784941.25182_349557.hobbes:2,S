That is not true of the report lun support, it was written initially for
support of any hardware. Of course it was tested on certain hardware, but
that was not the goal.

What is wrong with the one in scsi core?
Your implementation has problems for large numbers of LU the secondary
kmalloc() will always fail. I do not see how it handles transient failures
either, or (per below discussion) devices that return bogus data.

There could (will?) be bridges from SAS to anything (like existing SPI to
IDE bridges, or FC to SPI bridges), so it is likely it will have to
handle not-so-new and potentially brain dead storage devices.

That code was not written because anyone asked for it.

At least tell us what is wrong with it, I know it does not have well known
LUN support, and we already know about 8 byte LUN support.
IMO adding well known LUNs at this point to the standard added nothing of
value, the target firmware has to check for special paths no matter what,
adding a well known LUN does not change that. And most vendors will
(likely) have support for use without a well known LUN. (This does not
mean we should not support it in linux, I just don't know why this went
into the standard.)
Using well known LUNs will be another code path that will have to live
alongside existing ones, and will likely require further black listing
(similar to REPORT LUN vs scanning for LUNs).
