Hi,
 While browsing through apache core features, I came across 
accept_filtering in FreeBSD - via accf_http which places a filter on a 
socket (setsockopt - SO_ACCEPTFILTER) which  prevents the application 
from receiving the connected descriptor via *accept* until either a full 
HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 HEAD or GET request has been buffered by the kernel.
 Is there any equivalent for this in Linux? I only came across 
TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT option which only waits till the client sends an ACK 
back to server && first packet of data is recieved (accf_data on 
FreeBSD)...
 ...if there ain't this functionality any tips on how to go about 
implementing it?
thanks,
Arun
