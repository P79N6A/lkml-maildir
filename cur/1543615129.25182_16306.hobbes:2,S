It's hard to explain a love/hate relationship with C++.  I think many
systems programmers come to a point where they can "speak" C++ and do so
in design conversations all the time, talking about the "objects" and the
"methods", etc.  But they program in C.  
This sends a somewhat mixed message to the casual observer who might think
that one language or the other is "better".  The reality is that you want
tp program in a fairly object oriented way but you also want to avoid
"the creeping horror that modern C++ has become.".
Makes you wonder what would happen if someone tried to design a
minimalistic C++, call it the "M programming language", have be close
to C with the minimal useful parts of C++ included.
I've always said that if I get rich I'm going to fund some extensions to
GCC to make associative arrays be a built in type, to make perl like
regex's be a first class object, but maybe I was wrong, maybe I want to
fund "M" :-)  Sort of a moot point, I'm not rich.
