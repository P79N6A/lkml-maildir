its been in 2.4 for a year or so, although only in the last few tests as
it supported i815. it has been in 2.2 since 2.2.17 or the current 2.2.18.
take a look at linux/drivers/char/i810_rng.c
Jeff's homepage for it is 
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/i810_rng/
 but
probably not as up to date as the C source.
it works great for me. i have it feeding the standard entropy pool, so my
/dev/random is fat with entropy.
