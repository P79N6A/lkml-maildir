	Everyone wants this as the final solution, but all I want right now is
to have a clean patch for ARM RT .. It would be nice if ARM had the
generics, but It's not _my_ goal. 
	All I want to do is integrate the common IRQ threading code. To do that
I need things , from Russell, like per descriptor locks .. And I need
things , from Ingo, like pulling out the IRQ threading code..
