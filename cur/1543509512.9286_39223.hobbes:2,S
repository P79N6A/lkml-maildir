Now doing a small benchmark reveals that RT signals take a little bit
longer to arrive than normal signals. I have written a small program to
measure this in a 2.2.5-22 redhat std. kernel.
This gives me for 1000 signals the following numbers on a 166 MHz Pentium:
normal signal takes on average 7.9 microsecs
RT signal takes on average 10.9 microsecs
The difference must be due to the queueing of the signal.
What does the community think?
Is the patch ok as is and is the 3 extra microsec a problem? (please run
the test prog on your platform to give me an idea what kind of latencies
you have on other archs/faster CPUs)
Or should I be more conservative in the patch and only put siginfo's in
the queue when they are either RT or if they pass siginfo in the first
place (all signals)?
