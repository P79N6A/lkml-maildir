I was thinking to create as many object I need by the usual shm_open(), 
than mmap()
it on a process until I get ENOMEM. So, when I get a ENOMEM I start to
munmap() objects in order to free some user space memory and create the needed
space to complete mmap() for the requested object.

Could you explain better this approch?
