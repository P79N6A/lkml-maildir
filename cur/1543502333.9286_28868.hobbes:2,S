&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yup.&nbsp; Another arbitrary number (the rate of HZ on Alpha, btw).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Alpha case, we did some experiments at the time we went to the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new architecture to see how much overhead running at a higher rate would&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost; we made sure it was less than 1% on the slowest Alpha that would&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ever exist....&nbsp; Along comes Linux years later, and there have been some&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schedular related performance problems recently uncovered as a result&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; due to the simplicity (stupidity?) of the Linux scheduler, but I've seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no reason to regret this so far (the Linux schedular problems are generic:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they just show up 10 times as often at 1000hz).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguing that the interrupt load at 1000hz is significant on today's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; processor is specious.</pre>

<p><br>Fully agree today 1ms seens to be a pretty long time for the CPU's
point of view.
<br>A 400Mhz CPU&nbsp;executes at least 400 million instructions per second
, this means 400.000 per ms,
<br>I remember the Z80 which was able to execute 400.000 instructions per
second (at about 4Mhz)and the timer interrupt occurred
<br>about 60 times/sec , so the CPU was&nbsp; only able 6666 instruction
per timer interrupt.
<br>This let me suppose, that 1000HZ on modern CPUs adds very little overhead.
<br>The benefit is a smoother behavior of the entire system, especially
when more CPU-bound tasks are running.
<p>regards,
<br>Benno.
