You can search Debian lists, archives, ... for "tty-locking-fixes7". After 
that you probably know what the fix is good for.
On the other hand if there is a security fix in a Debian list you can check if 
your kernel is patched by running "zcat /proc/patches.gz | grep 
security-fix-foo-bar".

If a distribution has a naming convention for itself this patch can already be 
useful I think. Even without it can be.
