In the driver is:
static int S_Mmap(struct file * flip, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
 
<snip>
  unsigned long size = (unsigned long)vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start; 
<------size = 2000 for this case
  unsigned long start = (unsigned long)vma->vm_start;
   vma->vm_flags |= VM_LOCKED;
 
  vaddy = kmalloc(size , GFP_KERNEL);
  strcpy((char*)vaddy, "testing\0");
  mem_map_reserve(virt_to_page(vaddy));
  result = remap_page_range(start, virt_to_phys(vaddy), size, 
vma->vm_page_prot);
   if (result)
        return -EAGAIN;
 return 0;
 
in user space is:
<snip>
  pdma->dwBytes = 2000;
  pdma->pUserAddr =  mmap(0, pdma->dwBytes, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, 
MAP_SHARED, hWd, 0);
  str = (char*)pdma->pUserAddr;
<snip)
when I try to view the memory that I just mmap()ed using gdb I see:
$12 = 0x40018000 <Address 0x40018000 out of bounds>
If I don't do the mem_map_reserve() command I can view the memory but it 
is all zeros.
What am I missing?
TIA
