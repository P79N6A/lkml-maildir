Unfortunately after a few experiments my 3c59x does not resume correctly
with 2.4.18. I don't understand why but sometimes it takes a few seconds
to return in a good state after a suspend/resume cycle and sometimes (at
least one time) the card stay in a bad state.
Would it be possible that the driver is never notified that the machine
is going in a suspend mode ? 
When you said 'we now notify ...' the 'we' stand for apm ?
Looking in the driver, the enable_wol (now I know that wol means Wake up
on Lan, and I would prefer let this option disabled but it also turn on
pm stuff as Andrew told me) enables few acpi call.
Andrew : Is your card back immediately after resuming ?
