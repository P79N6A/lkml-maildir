We are having some trouble with the patch set that some of our fiber
channel
host controller doesn't initialize properly anymore and thus lost whole
bunch
of disks (somewhere around 200 disks out of 900) at boot time.
Presumably FC
loop initialization command are done through block layer etc.  I haven't
looked into the problem closely.
Jens, I assume the spin lock bug in __blk_run_queue is fixed in this
patch
set?
