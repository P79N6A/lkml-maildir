Hello,
I have found out something new about the cfs problem:
1) on a 2.6.20, working good:
after starting cfs, nothing cattach'd:
zeus:~# cat /proc/fs/nfsfs/volumes
NV SERVER   PORT DEV     FSID
v2 7f000001  be9 0:14    0:0
after cattaching (and at least once listing the directory, if not 
everything remains as above):
zeus:~# cat /proc/fs/nfsfs/volumes
NV SERVER   PORT DEV     FSID
v2 7f000001  be9 0:14    0:0
v2 7f000001  be9 0:15    1:0
from now everything is OK forever....
2) On 2.6.23  at cfsd restart
mars:~# cat /proc/fs/nfsfs/volumes
NV SERVER   PORT DEV     FSID
v2 7f000001  be9 0:14    0:0
after cattaching i get
mars:~# cat /proc/fs/nfsfs/volumes
NV SERVER   PORT DEV     FSID
v2 7f000001  be9 0:14    1:0
v2 7f000001  be9 0:15    1:0
The first FSID has chnaged and is 1:0 as the second while on 2.6.20 this 
doesnt happens.
I know nothing about NFS internals but isnt strange to have the same 
FSID on 2 volumes ?
BTW, the 2 machines have the same disk image. No diffs but the kernel.
Maybe this means nothing, if so sorry for the noise.
