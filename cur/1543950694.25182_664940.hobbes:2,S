I know ext4 is keep changing that it's a bit hard to create patch
against ext4, but I feel features like especially rewrite the default
ordered mode should done in ext4/jbd2. I could port to current ext4 and
JBD2 if you agrees with this.
Also, would it make sense to create a new ordered mode writepage
routines, and keep the old ordered mode code there for a while, to allow
easy comparison? This could a good transition for people to start
experiment this ordered mode without worrying about put data in danger
by default.

Any thoughts how to handle the unmapped page under case 1)? Right now I
see it fails. Your comments here saying that we still have the issue
that "can't start a new transaction while commiting", but likely, with
delayed allocation, starting a new transaction could to happen a lot to
do defered block allocation. 
I really hope this new mode could be easy to add delayed allocation
support.  Any thoughts that we could workaround the locking in the JBD2
layer?
