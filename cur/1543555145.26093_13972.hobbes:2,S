The manpage is dated 1 Dec 1998 and reads
DESCRIPTION
       This call copies data  between  one  file  descriptor  and
       another.   Either  or  both  of these file descriptors may
       refer to a socket.  in_fd  should  be  a  file  descriptor
       opened  for  reading  and  out_fd  should  be a descriptor
       opened for writing.
If that is incorrect, then editing a private copy of the manpage,
as Dan Hollis, or the distributor from whom he got his page,
seems to have done, does not suffice to change the manpage distribution.
(Moreover, the text Dan Hollis quotes is rather strange --
also sockets give one a file descriptor, so the author
of that modified man page did not know what he was talking
about, or was not being precise.)
