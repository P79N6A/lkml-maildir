Hi,
	The post you're refering had a patch applied to the kernel, its
somewhere back there in the archives.  Basically what's happening is that
the kernel assumes that a stepping of zero means unknown, but for AMD's
such a stepping is valid.  The fix is rather trivial, look into
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c inside get_cpuinfo().
	Cheers,
		Rafael
