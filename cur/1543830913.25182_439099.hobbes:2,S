    SGI has already shipped more than a dozen SGI systems with
    over a terabyte of memory and about a hundred systems of half
    a terabyte or larger. But the new Altix will have much larger
    memory capacities. The systems SGI has in mind will scale to tens
    of terabytes and beyond. In fact, a few SGI customers are already
    testing with systems in the 10-terabyte range. "The largest we
    have shipped is a 13-terabyte memory system for the Japan Atomic
    Energy Agency," said [SGI CTO Dr. Eng Lim] Goh.
