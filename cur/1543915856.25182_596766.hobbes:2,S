 It applies on top of current -mm.  It seems to apply to a copy of 
netdev-2.6.git#upstream that I have got, but I am probably missing 
something...  If I try to clone your repository again I get:
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/linux-netdev-2.6.git linux
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/macro/GIT-other/linux-netdev/linux/.git/
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
fetch-pack from 'git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/linux-netdev-2.6.git' failed.
$
For linux-2.6.git the patch-mips-2.6.23-rc5-20070904-sb1250-mac-typedef-7 
version applies as submitted originally; I can resubmit this one if you 
like.
 I am slowly getting lost and I have another big chunk for sb1250-mac.c 
waiting to be put on top of these...
