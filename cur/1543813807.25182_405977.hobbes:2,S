After looking over these patches, it appears there two 'minor'
things missing... comments and dprintk statements... :-)
Maybe I missed them, but out of all these 14 patches (i.e. basically
rewriting a critical part of kNFSD) not one comment or dprintk
as added....
Now I'm sure this is a much better design that the previous one,
(i.e. hide sight is always 20/20) and I'm looking forward to
help iron out the nits... But without meaningful comments and a way
to turn on a _few_ well placed "I failed here" type of debug
messages, the design really doesn't matter since the maintainable
has not improved... imho...
Secondly,  In a number of places, mostly in the alloc routines and in
patch 006 there are if statements like:
+	if (ch)
+		return container_of(ch, struct svc_export, h);
+	else
+		return NULL;
the else is simply not needed... Plus adding a dprintk like:
+	if (ch)
+		return container_of(ch, struct svc_export, h);
+	
+	dprintk("svc_export_update: returns NULL\n");
+	return NULL;
might make sense... assuming svc_export_update does not return NULL
99% of the time...
steved.
