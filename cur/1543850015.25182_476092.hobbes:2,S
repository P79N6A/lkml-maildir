There was a long LKML thread ("Generic battery interface") about this in July.
This a general issue in sysfs, applicably whenever sysfs is used to
communicate device data (as opposed to system configuration). We need
a generic solution. Here are a few of the considerations that came up
in that thread:
- Efficiency on both poll-based and event-based hardware data sources.
- Avoiding unnecessary timer interrupts on tickless kernels.
- Letting multiple userspace clients poll the same data source at
different rates, without causing duplicate queries or unnecessary
process wakeups.
- Avoiding duplicate queries on poll-based hardware that provides
several attributes simultaneously.
Here's my latest proposed solution in that thread (but see the dozens
of messages before and after for context...):

30 seconds? I've seen battery applets that poll 1sec intervals (that's
actually useful when you tweak power saving). And for things like the
hdaps accelerometer driver, we're at the 50HZ region.

This is a very interesting approach; I don't recall anything like this
from on the older thread.
There are a few problems though:
You can't require reading battery status to be a root-only operation.
When mutiple userspace apps poll the battery, you'll get race
conditions on timestamp, and even in the best case all the apps will
be woken up at the poll rate of the most-frequently-polling app (think
of that happening at 50HZ for hdaps...).
