More specifically, that was on SGI Origin2000 32p mips64 ccNUMA
hardware.  The pagecache_lock bottleneck is substantially less on SGI
Itanium ccNUMA hardware running those AIM7 workloads.  I'm seeing
moderately significant contention on the Big Kernel Lock, mostly from
sys_lseek() and ext2_get_block().
