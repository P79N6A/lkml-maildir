Hmm, because there's one attribute: which module would own it?  You're
going to creation attributes per module later (for module parameters),
so when you do that it might make sense to do this too.

The lifetimes are separate, each controlled by their own reference
count.  I *know* this will work even if someone holds a reference to
the kobject (for some reason in the future) even as the module is
removed.
