It's slightly offtopic, but you should think about detached shm
segments in yout OOM killer. As many of the high end applications like
databases and e.g. SAP have most of the memory in shm segments you
easily end up killing a lot of processes without freeing a lot of
memory. I see this often in my shm tests.
