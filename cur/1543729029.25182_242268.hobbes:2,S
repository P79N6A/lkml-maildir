WHat is being measured is the length of time between jackd is woken up
and when it runs - the xrun report prints the difference between the
current time and the timestamp returned by
snd_pcm_status_get_trigger_tstamp (updated by the interrupt handler) and
the current time.
jackd prints a different error message if it detects that the interrupt
handler was delayed, this is a separate issue than an xrun.  I have seen
this happen before, but I don't think this is going on here.
