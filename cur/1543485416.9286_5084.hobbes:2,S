Hi all !
I've noticed a stange behaviour on loopback-devices ...
If I use tcpump on the interface lo each packet is shown twice to me (2
x incoming, 2 x outgoing). Maybe this is an unwanted behaviour ?!? (I
didn't find anything about this behaviour in any documentation about
loopback-devices)
Maybe someone can have a look at it ?
I ran in some serious problem (solving a problem by using a C-program)
with this behaviour on the loopback-device ... (on FreeBSD and SunOS
I've never seen a behaviour like this)
Kai
