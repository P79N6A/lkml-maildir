Well at least on the rawhide SRPMS dir i found the 2.2.14 kernel and
reading the spec you can see this:
# define lfs as either 0 (for off) or 1 (for on) when making the kernel
%define lfs 1
Patch20: linux-2.2.14-lfs-headers.patch
#Patch21: linux-2.2.13-lfs.patch
Patch21: linux-2.2.14-lfs.patch
and i'm actually running this kernel with LFS support w/o problems right
now, but i had no file over 2 BG on my box, but the support is there, 
so maybe RedHat 6.2 will ship with support for Over 2GB Files, 
just my 2 cents.
Regards!
