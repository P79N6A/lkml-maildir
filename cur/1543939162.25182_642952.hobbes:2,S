I'm doing a make oldconfig with the new 2.6.24 kernel.  I came to the prompt for "Default Linux Capabilities" which defaults to No:
---
 Default Linux Capabilities (SECURITY_CAPABILITIES) [N/y/?] (NEW) ?
---
However the help text recommends saying Yes.
---
 This enables the "default" Linux capabilities functionality.
 If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer Y.
---
Does this seem incongruous?  Also, what's the "question"? :)
Thanks,
