The cards we were testing were 11b, so they wouldn't fall under the
banner of any evil frequency hopping device.  Crippling the PCI slot to
prevent use of a card that could potentially break FCC regs provided
someone uses nonexistant published specs to develop an as-yet
nonexistant driver seems a might rash, don'tcha think ?
