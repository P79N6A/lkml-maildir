I do agree (heh, for once) with that in the sense that in the long run,
we should strip the kernel console down to the bare minimum to boot,
display oopses, etc... and have all the fancy stuff, unicode, VT, and
more in a userspace console process.
However, I'm a little bit worried that we'll end up with 10 competing
incompatible and inconsistent userspace console projects and -that- will
be horrible.
But it's something separate from what Dave and Jesse are trying to
address. Let's first gets the fundation right and -then- we can do all
sort of crazy things. Or maybe you can start working on a user console
project in parallel using the new APIs that Jesse and Dave are
providing ? :-)

I do agree on that in the long run, but again, let's look into this
-after- we have solved the more immediate issues. We can probably kill
most of fbdev, fbcon and current VT once we have a solid userland based
replacement that isn't completely bloated (maybe with a "slim" version
that does only VGA and non-utf8 for server type apps).

That's irrelevant. Implementation detail.

And that's bullshit :-)
