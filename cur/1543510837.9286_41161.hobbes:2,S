With the current tests I've done, the major limiting factor is
poll()/select(). This is partially fixed by the SIGIO patches and will be
completely ready to replace poll()/select() when the final patches for si_band
are integrated.
If you want to rig a setup that does the same thing for 100k connections, you
can under Linux given enough RAM, but it won't be a realistic test.
Now, if you can setup a real POP3, IMAP4, FTP or HTTP server that could handle
100,000 simultaneous connections from real clients, that would be something.
