just a quick success report. I just jumped from 2.1.131 tonight all
the way to 2.2.0-pre4. It has seen 4 complete kernel compiles, 4 full
reboots, a bunch of MIDI I/O, RT FIFO processes, and lots of other
development work tonight. No problems of any kind noted. This is all
on a dual PII-450 on an SuperMicro P6DBU (Award BIOS, Adaptec 7890 U2W
SCSI).
Subjective speed is way up. X performance has visibly improved
(probably the mtrr stuff ?) A kernel compile with my usual config
takes 1m 48s (elapsed, on 2 processors (899.48 BogoMIPS) using make
-j4 MAKE="make -j4").
i've wanted to say thanks before, but this time i really should say
it: Thanks to Linus and every Linux kernel contributor who has made
this possible. And thanks also to every user-land contributor who has
enabled me to sit in front of a lightning fast machine and have easy
access to the source code for every aspect of this ultra-stable,
ultra-usable system. 
Hell, this is so fast, I might even bother to get GNOME :)
