But is it high enough quality??  And if it is good why did ALSA start?

What do you mean?  Too many old cards supported.  Or too many capabilities.
Or too complex.  Or what?
And if there is a problem irking "consumers" why aren't they responding?

Why start again?  Why not help fix whatever is wrong with ALSA?  
Thanks for responding I think I have enough unbiased information to join the
alsa mailing list(if there is one) and see if I can help.  I think its
(multimedia) an area where Linux needs to improve.  Linux is good but not as
developed as MS in this area.
