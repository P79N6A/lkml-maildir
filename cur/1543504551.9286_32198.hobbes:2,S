The solution to this sort of problem tends to appear once similar reports
show a common element.  Have the -ac kernels been tried on this problem
setup?  Several corruption bugs were spotted in the series and are fixed
in the 2.2.11 prepatches.  If the problem still isn't fixed, comparing
kernel config options against two similar machines may be of immense
value -- options like quota being used can sometimes have a significant
impact on normal codes.
