alsa-base doesn't supply any modules:
# apt-file list alsa-base
alsa-base: etc/apm/event.d/alsa
alsa-base: etc/devfs/conf.d/alsa
alsa-base: etc/init.d/alsa
alsa-base: usr/share/alsa-base/alsa-base.conf
alsa-base: usr/share/alsa-base/modules-snippet.conf
alsa-base: usr/share/alsa-base/program-wrapper
alsa-base: usr/share/alsa-base/snddevices
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/FAQ
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/NEWS.Debian.gz
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/README
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/README.Debian
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/SOUNDCARDS.gz
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/WARNING
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/changelog.Debian.gz
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/copyright
alsa-base: usr/share/doc/alsa-base/examples/modules-1.0.conf
alsa-base: usr/share/linda/overrides/alsa-base
alsa-base: usr/share/lintian/overrides/alsa-base
And the init.d script doesn't do any loading of modules. It saves and
restores the mixer settings.

Correct, for any version of debian where the supplied kernel is >= 2.6
I'd say.
