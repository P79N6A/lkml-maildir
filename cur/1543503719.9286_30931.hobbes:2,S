Yes, it really is a loaded gun.  A large SCHED_IDLE process can consume
arbitrary system resources, and if there is any single cpu-bound process
preventing it from being scheduled, you won't even be able to kill -9
the SCHED_IDLE task (the kill signal isn't delivered until the task is
next scheduled).
It is much more dangerous than it first appears, and the DoS attacks
look really nasty.
