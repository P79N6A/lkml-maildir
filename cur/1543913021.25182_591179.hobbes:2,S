I'm inclined to write this one off as general STR weirdness.  The 
problem is reproducible on 2.6.22 if CONFIG_FB is enabled (even if not 
*used*!), and there is a working workaround that is required on a lot of 
machines.
This is suboptimal, of course, but it seems to require a pretty deep 
investigation into the intricacies of this particular platform.
