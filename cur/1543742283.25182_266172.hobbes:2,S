Due to rule that not everything should be in kernel, userspace
picks one of codes needed to switch processor from currently used
mode  & address space to mode VMware needs (ia32 => long, long => ia32, 
PAE <=> non-PAE + cr3 + gdt + idt) maps it into kernel space, and then run 
it as needed.  And for running it it must be executable.
OK, I think that I understand message.  __pgprot(__PAGE_KERNEL & ~_PAGE_NX)
is my friend.
