I've got something similar myself; mine's more complex, handles and
reports IRQs but isn't near releasable.  Happens :-)

to do what you've got above, no extra points there ;-)

Creating the device file is largely mdev/udev's job, most people don't
have to worry about it.
As I mentioned before (and in my review of simple_gpio) I really like
the idea of having labels attached to the gpio numbers in some way; as
it stands I see that as simple_gpio's only major weakness.
David, you're kinda the gatekeeper here; any input from you on which
approach is to be preferred, essential features etc?
