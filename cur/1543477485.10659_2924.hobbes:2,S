I have the same problem with pre4 --- it's up since I compiled it and it was 
really fast at the beginning but got sluggish now.
pbunyk:~> cat /proc/version 
Linux version 2.2.0-pre4 (root@pbunyk.physics.sunysb.edu) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #2 SMP Mon Jan 4 14:40:25 EST 1999

Swap is not used that much, but when I copied some (large) MPEGs from one 
disk to another netscape/emacs/etc got swapped out.
I guess I'll compile the latest pre (7?), but this kind of problem is hard 
to reproduce since I'll have to wait for couple days uptime before things 
turn bad.
