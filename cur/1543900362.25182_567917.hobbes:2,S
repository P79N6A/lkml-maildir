..
I'm not even sure how to interpret those numbers.
It seems rather odd that nearly all fields are either "100" or "253",
so those are probably pre-programmed numbers rather than actual counts.
The raw value at the end of the line (for the various "Reallocated*" fields)
is probably the real value here.
