Thats an extreme situation though.  I think everyone is happy about it for
binary compatibility at application levels. Juggling this kind of stuff to
suit IBM's own problems isn't trivial. I think people have a right to expect
2.2.* to run binaries identically (well barring bug fixes meaning they now
work right!) but at the module level its far from trivial.
