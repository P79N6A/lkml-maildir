Hi,
  I have  ported a wlan driver from 2.4 to 2.6.
  I am referring to the porting article in lwn.net.
  The driver works fine for sometime. after which data transfer
becomes very slow.
  i have telnet to a remote machine. i do ls -Rl /
  data transfer is ok to start with, then it becomes very slow.
  also whatever i type on the shell prompt appears after a while.
  This happens - sometimes it is faster and then slow. this goes on in a cycle.
  Is there any difference between a 2.4 and 2.6 kernel network stack?.
  I have changed registeration, changing task queues to work queues
and stuff like that.
   am not sure if the network stack api's and thier meanings have changed.
   is there anything i should watch out for?.
  sometimes i do get : NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
   What does this mean?.
 is there anything more i should watch out for?.
Regards,
sriram
