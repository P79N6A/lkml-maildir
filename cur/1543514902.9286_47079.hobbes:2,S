      ^^^^ I seem to be missing this message...
Roman, if this is indeed your writing, you seem to have misinterpreted my patch.
We do not do any "faking" at all.  On a machine with a non-contiguous address
space, we do not "fake" a contiguous address space, but we do a straight conversion,
ie, phys = (virt - offset) or some other simple mathematical function.

IMHO, __pa should not be the same as virt_to_phys().  If they are indeed
supposed to be the same, can we loose one of the names?  It's a needless
complication which should not be there, and can lead to needless confusion.
However, as Roman points out, if the bootmem stuff is to use virt_to_phys(),
unless a "start" page number is passed in, the bit array could be
unnecessarily large, and may in certain systems cause major problems
(systems with many small (512KB) banks of memory).

I believe that virt_to_phys() ought to behave as we expect - convert a kernel
virtual address to a physical address, but __pa() or maybe a renamed __pa()
should return the offset into physical memory of the virtual address.
