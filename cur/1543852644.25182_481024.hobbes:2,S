As per the recent thread about this, XFS threads suspend correctly
and XFS doesn't issue I/O from timers.
The problem appears to be per-cpu workqueues that don't get
suspended because suspend does not shut down workqueue threads. You
haven't quiesced the filesystem, you haven't shut down work
queues, but you're expecting the filesystem to magically stop
using them when suspend starts up?
You can't lay the blame on any subsystem for using an interface that
suspend doesn't quiesce when you *haven't told the subsystem it
should suspend itself*. This is true regardless of whether the
subsystem is a device driver, part of the network stack or a
filesystem.
e.g. A struct device has suspend and resume callouts so that each
device can be safely suspended and resumed. Suspend uses these and
you sure as hell don't expect a device to work properly after a
resume if you don't use these interfaces.
So why do you think filesystems should be treated differently?
Cheers,
Dave.
