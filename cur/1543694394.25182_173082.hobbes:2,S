The system used to run 2.4.22 and did not have this too much work
problem.  There were some other hardware changes.  The system used to be
a Pentium 100 on a Triton 430FX chipset Intel Advanced/EV board.  Now it 
is a K6 2 - 500 on a Via Apollo MVP3 chipset on FIC VA-503+ board.
The NIC stayed the same.  The kernel was recompiled and ACPI was
enabled.
I noticed in 2.4.23-pre2 -> pre3
	 [netdrvr] sync with 2.5: epic100, fealnx, via-rhine, winbond-840
