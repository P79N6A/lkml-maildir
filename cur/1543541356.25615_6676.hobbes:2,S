	Hi, All.
	Since my trustworthy, old computer (which is also part/time
	server for a little network that I have) is starting to have
	problems, I think that I'll buy another in the near future.
	Evaluating some of the alternatives, I see that an Athlon
	based system would be a good purchase. I did a little research
	and it seems that the best motherboards for such beasts would
	be the Asus K7V and the Abit KA7-100. These boards use the VIA
	KX133 chipset and feature UDMA/100 controllers, which
	according to André's site, Linux now supports.
	But then comes the not-so-funny part: I've read some horror
	stories of Linux running with these boards (like them being
	terribly unstable, not being able to configure UDMA with the
	VIA chipsets, the controller corrupting filesystems if UDMA is
	turned on etc).
	So, before spending my scarce and hard-earned bucks, I'd like
	to know what is the current status of the support that Linux
	has for these chipsets.  Should I avoid the Athlon land and
	stick with a Pentium system? I understand that Abit's P3 board
	BE6-II has a good reputation from reviews that I've read (but
	I confess that I'm a little bit scared after reading problems
	people are having with the BP6, the SMP board).
	That was what stopped me from getting a new Athlon system...
	Linux support and stability are my main concerns and I'll
	welcome any comments/experiences that people might have.
	Thank you very much for any recommendations, Roger...
