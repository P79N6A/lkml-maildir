Hmm ..adding entries on dead cpu's ->donelist to ->nxtlist of some other CPU 
doesnt make sense (it re-triggers graceperiods for all those callbacks which is 
not needed). Maybe rcu_move_batch should take that into account and instead add
to ->donelist of current CPU which is processing the CPU_DEAD callback.
In which case, ->donelist != NULL check is still reqd in rcu_pending ?
