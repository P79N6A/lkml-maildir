I'm getting a huge sendfile regression in 2.6.1; when serving a large
file on an IPv4 TCP socket via sendfile64, the transfer starts at about
4 MB (2.6.0: >7 MB) and the hard disk like stays on 100% (which normally
only happens if the file is badly fragmented, fragmentation of this file
is 0%).  Then, suddenly, the network performance drops dramatically,
getting worse and worse.  strace shows that the process is hanging
inside sendfile64 (which should not happen since the socket is
non-blocking).  The process then stays inside sendfile for up to a
minute or so and can't be interrupted or killed in that time.
Please fix!
Felix
