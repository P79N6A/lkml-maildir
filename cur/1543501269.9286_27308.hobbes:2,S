Hi,
  I am facing problems in referencing the global variables in the
kernel in my kernel module. For eg. I am not able to refer
ldiscs array nor the linked lists of "tty_drivers" defined in
drivers/char/tty_io.c. I have browsed the relevant docs without
much help. Can anybody help me in this regard?
Please CC me in your replies since I haven't subscribed to the

TIA
Jana
