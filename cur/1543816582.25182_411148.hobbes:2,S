Right. 
It was a stupid idea even in the 80's. It's only gotten stupider since.
Now, during the 80's it was at least _excusable_. It was reasonable to 
think that you can just enumerate the controllers. And it was simple, and 
since hotplug controllers back then was "operator plug", not the modern 
kind of "they magically show up", it worked and controller numbers _meant_ 
something (even though they'd change when you switched things around, but 
you can expect that).
These days, you just cannot enumerate controllers in any meaningful 
manner. I don't think you ever really could, but at least with static 
hardware, any random enumeration was as good as any other.
