Berkeley DB 4.2.52 for instance documents that page writes (of data base
pages) must be atomic, hence, if the data base page size is larger than
what the FS can write atomically, a crash may leave the data base in a
non-recoverable (catastrophic) state. (This assumes using the
write-ahead logging "Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store" mode of
operation, the other modes aren't recoveable after crash anyways.)
