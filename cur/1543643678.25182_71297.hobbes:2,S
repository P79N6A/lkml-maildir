   Some NUMA boxes do not have synced TSC, so on those systems your
   code won't work.
It would have been really nice if x86 had specified a "system tick"
register that incremented based upon the system bus cycles and thus
were immune the processor rates.
I foresee lots of patches coming which basically are "how does this
x86 system provide a stable synchronized tick source".
