V4L_USB_DRIVERS=y turns USB into =y? That can't be. It should give the "this
depends on another symbol [USB] that is modular".

The default y only applies to the "menu" folders, not actual code.
There have been discussions to remove the default-ys again, I've sent a patch
[
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/12/216
], but nothing happened.
So, should all affected menuconfigs be transformed into tristates, what 
do you think, Roman? Let me know so I can cook up a patch (hopefully 
before 2.6.22) should they become tristate.
Thanks,
