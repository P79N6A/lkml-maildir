In the context of Linux, this is certainly not true.  Linux/ia64
always has been LP64 (i.e., sizeof(long)=8).  Perhaps you're confusing
this with the hp-ux C compiler, which defaults to ILP32?  Another
potential source of confusion is Windows, which uses the P64 data
model (only pointers and "long long" are 64 bits).
