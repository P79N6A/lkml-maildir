And then we should start playing stupid games with file descriptors. And then
you can not spawn simple process to communicate with extenal program over net.
And my 20 apache processes will require 800MiB of virtual memory instead of
60MiB they are using now. Not every fork will end up with exec, you know. No,
fork()/exec() is RIGHT thing. And sometimes it's right thing to redirect
compiler warnings to /dev/null if compiler just not clever enough to find out
that warning is bogus. Replacing fork()/exec() with new system call a-la
WindowsNT looks like flu curing with guillotine.
