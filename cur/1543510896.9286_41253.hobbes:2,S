I don't actually disagree that this specific case is a bug in the
Config.in file, however it annoys me to see over and over again how
the Config.in files are changed to get around stupidities in the menu
based config tools.

Except that it requires that the people who write the patches actually
use these tools. There is no way I am going to waste time running
menuconfig/xconfig before shipping something.

This is of course oppinion based, I happen to like `make config' and
dislike the menu based ones.

I am not arguing against the fact that a required keyword was missing,
that _is_ a bug. What I am pointing out is that it always seem to be
the menu based config tools that break things.

If it is going to break the readability of the current Config.in,
.config and defconfig files then no thanks. Anything that requires
more than a standard bash shell to run should be optional.

Note that killing things like 'make oldconfig' and 'make config' is
not going to get you a lot of friends. Menuconfig and xconfig have
always been options, not the default, I hope it stays like that.
