If your interest is in creating a new and unique OS, you'll likely find that it 
becomes a great deal of work to try to glue the linux drivers into it.
I would imagine in the majority of cases you'd either have to change the driver 
code considerably to fit the subtleties of <newos>, or change the <newos> code 
considerably to fit the subtleties of linux.
When creating a new system, the last thing you want to have to do is carry 
around a bunch of extra baggage that you really don't need.
Anyways, this is 2003, aren't operating systems supposed to be boring by now? 
And where's my flying car damnit. ;)
To answer your question more directly, I think most developers would agree that 
the spirit of the GPL is "give as you take". If just releasing back the source 
to the modified drivers - completely useless without your new closed kernel - 
doesn't feel a whole lot like "giving", then you're probably not doing enough to 
keep people happy.
