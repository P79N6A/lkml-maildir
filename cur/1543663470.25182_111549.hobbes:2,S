That would appear to do what you want, but its an ugly construct to
be repeating everywhere that wants to call a function on all CPUs.
It would probably clean things up a lot if we had a function to do..
static inline void on_each_cpu(void *func)
{      
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	preempt_disable();
	smp_call_function(func, NULL, 1, 1);
	func(NULL);
	preempt_enable();
#else
	func(NULL);
#endif
}
Bluesmoke and agpgart could both use this to cleanup some mess,
and no doubt there are others
Comments?
