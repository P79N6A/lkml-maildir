Hmm, I still don't like it. What does it do to timestamping in
interrupts in the kernel, especially when there is a burst of
interrupts?
If I read it correctly, the time will be frozen between the time
the timer interrupt should have arrived and the time it is processed.
So the last micosecond of the interval could extend well into the next
interval, or do I miss something (I also suspect that it could
make PPSKit behave strangely for this reason)?

So wouldn't it be better to put:
			usec = max(usec, tick_usec)-tickadj;
to freeze the time for only a few microseconds even for kernel clients
of gettimeofday() when the timer interrupt comes a bit late?
Now if you are looking at the microsecond level of precision, there is 
something else in which is worth considering as commented in the
appended patch. In short, I consider "do it first because it's faster 
to be a bogus argument", rather do it in the order which should
minimize the jitter of the measurements (outb and inb have enough
serialization that no other synchronization should be necessary).
I'm not sure that it will result in easily measurable improvements. 
But it should not hurt either.
The same could be applied to other timer in the file (HPET) and other files 
but I don't have any machines on which I can test these, and ensuring
that the instruction are executed in the right order is a bit more
difficult than with inb and outbs.
