Basically I think this is just a matter of modifying telnetd and
sshd so that for the display they follow the users locale,
at least in cooked mode.
Does anyone have a good grasp what the exact semantics should be and
where the translation should happen?  I know we need to delay the
translation as long as possible so we can get binary streams flowing
through these protocols? 
I guess my question is when do we know the information is going to
a terminal so we should translate it?
