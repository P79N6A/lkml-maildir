Hi,
When running sparse checks on a file that ends up including srcu.h, we
get the following warnings:
    include/linux/srcu.h:52:44: error: undefined identifier 'sp'
    include/linux/srcu.h:52:44: error: bad constant expression
    include/linux/srcu.h:53:56: error: undefined identifier 'sp'
    include/linux/srcu.h:53:56: error: bad constant expression
It seems to be caused by the following lines:
    int srcu_read_lock(struct srcu_struct *sp) __acquires(sp);
    void srcu_read_unlock(struct srcu_struct *sp, int idx) __releases(sp);
which come from the following commit.
    commit 621934ee7ed5b073c7fd638b347e632c53572761

    [PATCH] srcu-3: RCU variant permitting read-side blocking
I was wondering if there is a way to fix those errors...
Thanks,
Brice
