Subject: Q: which archs differ between VERIFY_READ and VERIFY_WRITE in access_ok?

I noticed that access_ok receives a flag that specifies read or write 
access.
Do any archs rely on that flag, except 80386?
For example sys_poll contains:
>	if (copy_from_user(pp->entries, ufds + nfds-i, 
>				sizeof(struct pollfd)*pp->len)) {
>			err = -EFAULT;
>			goto out_fds;
>		}
>		i -= pp->len;

>				goto out_fds;

If an arch really treats VERIFY_READ differently that VERIFY_WRITE, then 
this would be wrong.
Are there ports that perform some checks only for VERIFY_WRITE? I have a 
fix for 80386.
