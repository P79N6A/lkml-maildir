We have a specific qualifier for ptrdiff_t... Why not add one (untested!)
for resource_size_t, and get rid of all these bloody annoying casts?
I'm more than slightly irritated to have to go and add ugly
(unsigned long long) casts to squelch compiler whining on parisc.
This patch will probably cause even more compiler warnings thought because
gcc will try to be too smart with the use of formats...
