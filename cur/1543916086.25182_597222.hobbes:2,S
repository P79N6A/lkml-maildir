Subject: [PATCH] Reduce __print_symbol/sprint_symbol stack usage. (v3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello all,
(1) Problem:
I. When CONFIG_4KSTACKS and CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW are enabled on
i386 kernels, do_IRQ calls dump_stack which, down the path, uses
print_symbol (display) and  sprint_symbol (format) to format and display
the function name/address/module.
Both function use stack based char array (~350 bytes) that, given the
initial state (<512 bytes of stack space) may overrun the stack.
II. (Comments - previous patches) Using spinlock protected static
storage within these functions might block or even deadlock dump_stack
(E.g. Crash within dump_stack itself)
(2) Solution:
I. Break sprint_symbol into sprint_symbol (API functions; keeps the
current interface) and sprint_symbol_helper (helper function with
minimal local storage). 
II. Replace the char array in __print_symbol with two spinlock protected
static char arrays; call the __sprint_symbol helper function instead of
sprint_symbol.
III. Ignore the spinlock if oops_in_progress is set.
(3) Comments:
I. Currently, if oops_in_progress is set, multiple callers can trash
each other.
II. In order to solve it, print_symbol (and/or dump_stack itself) must
be aware of it's own context. (Read: if it's being called by oops, or by
a "debug/warning" code).
III. Possible solutions:
A. Add oops_in_progress_cpuid to bust_spinlocks (Hack, but generates far
less noise).
B. Add priority tag to all the functions that handle the calls stuck.
(Nicer, requires a massive tree-changing patch.)

Satyam, Paulo,
     A. I hope this patch better complies with your comments.
