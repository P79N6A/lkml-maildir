Right, I was never suggesting that we take either of those mutexes for
this operation. The spin lock in css_get() was an attempt to avoid
that. But I think you're right that it was too heavyweight, and can be
avoided with atomic operations. See my other email to Pavel.

The bind/unbind from active hierarchies is supported in the user-space
API, and it's implemented for hierarchies that have no child
containers. Hence it's important, at least conceptually, for the
reference count to be held by the subsystem state rather than the
container.
Implementing a full bind/unbind for arbitrary subsystems and
hierarchies will indeed be a lot of work, which is why I'm not trying
to do it at this point.
