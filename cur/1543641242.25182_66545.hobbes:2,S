This patch includes only the core functionality of the SGI XFS
filesystem for Linux 2.5.32.  It does NOT include changes for Posix
ACLs, dmapi, kdb or other code included in the XFS CVS tree.
The patch adds the self-contained XFS code and makes almost no modifications
to existing kernel code.  Diffstat output with new files stripped:
