Richard at this alpha breakpoint I think we can as well merge my SMP irq
rewrite before 2.4.0 (that allows PCI irq to scale all over the CPUs in
SMP and that make the irq code SMP safe).

My rewrite is necessary if we want to scale with more than one CPU and
more than one NIC and it fixes a few bugs in the alpha irq code.
My irq breakage in arch/alpha/kernel is shown explicitly by the code that
doesn't compile and fixing the 7 not yet uptodate platforms is not a pain
and can be done based on the previous code. The design is the same of x86.
I only run my machine with my irq scaling code applyed and I _never_ had
one problem. I know you had problems with irq probing but unless I get
more details and bugreports I can't certainly fix that since I can't
reproduce anything of strange here.
The alpha SMP irq patch I run all the time against 2.3.42 is here:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.3/2.3.42/alpha-irq-4.gz
I checked it generates two silly (trivially fixable) rejects on the top of
2.3.43. I'll produce anyway soon a 2.3.43 version (as soon as I'll run
2.3.43 on alpha ;).
Comments?
