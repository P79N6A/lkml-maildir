This isn't only about DRM protecting your distributed kernel.
Lets say you want to make a linux-driven home entertainment
device.  And you add DRM - not to protect the kernel you don't
really care about, but in order to use protected content in a
restricted fashion. Perhaps your business also sell DVDs.
Saying that the DRM doesn't apply to the kernel itself won't
help.  Users may, in this case, want to alter the DRM so it
doesn't restrict their use of Cds, DVDs etc.  That however
breaks with the DMCA - even if you allow unrestricted source
code modifications.  So you cannot legally distribute a kernel
with DRM - because DRM comes with a "no tampering" law
which don't work with the GPL.  Businesses can still add
DRM stuff in a proprietary userland app though.
The fact that DMCA law is a restriction imposed by
government rather than the distributor makes no difference.
The distributor implicitly imposes restrictions by linking in DRM sw, just
as the distributor would implicitly impose some restrictions by
linking a proprietary-licenced object into the kernel.
