Just give the interface _both_ addresses for now. It is quite possible
(although quite inefficient) to run several IP networks on the same
Ethernet.
OTOH, why do you need to keep the IP address? If setup right, the DNS (or
NIS, as the case may be) will take care of translating from an invariant
name to the changing IP address.
