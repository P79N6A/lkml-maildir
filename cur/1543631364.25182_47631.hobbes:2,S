There was a kernel patch posted about5 or so months ago which would
"handle" this setup (CPUs with the same clock speed, but different
multipliers).  Alan Cox said it probably was a bad idea, so it wouldn't
go into the kernel, but the patch may still be usable.
This is sometimes called "asymmetric multiprocessing", and the thread
is at http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=98519070331478&w=4
