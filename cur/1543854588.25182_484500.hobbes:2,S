  Yes, I could not find an elegant way to tackle this, so I left it
float for a while.

  Right, that's what I really wanted to avoid at all costs.

  Yes, but you end up duplicating a lot of code, but if it's the price to
pay, I'm all for it.

  I completely aggree. I will look into this.
  Thanks,
