Indeed. I looked at /proc/self/wchan, but of course that is 0 because
the process is running. 
But there is numerical wchan anyways - just get it from /proc/*/stat
That is what all 2.4 based tops always used.  I bet they still
have the fallback code for that around.The 2.6 change 
will just be to read the symbol table from /proc/kallsyms instead
of from the System.map file.

Change what behaviour? I argue that doing it in the kernel is the wrong
thing.
