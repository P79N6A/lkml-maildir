In 2.6.21, smsc-ircc2 at least found the device.  So we definitely have
a problem because in 2.6.22-rc, we don't find the device.
What laptop do you have?  Maybe I can find one to play with.
I think Windows always calls _SRS, even if it doesn't need to change
the current resource settings.  Linux doesn't do that, and my HP nw8240
firmware has a bug that leaves the IR device partly-enabled until _SRS
is called.  Maybe yours has a similar bug.
Can you set CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y, make it so smsc-ircc2 isn't loaded
automatically, and try this (along with my previous patch to swap
FIR and SIR):
  # dmesg -n 8
  # echo 0x200 > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_level
  # echo disable > /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:0a/resources
  # echo activate > /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:0a/resources
  # modprobe smsc-ircc2
If you try this, can you collect the whole dmesg log?
It's also possible that some other driver like i2c is messing with
the ISA/LPC bridge configuration and breaking the IR device config.
Your lspnp output doesn't show any other ISA devices down there,
but I know i2c likes to poke around and discover things that kinda,
sorta work, but the BIOS didn't expose.
