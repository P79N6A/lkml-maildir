applied, but, you forgot rule #6:
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
Specifically, include the full description in each patch resend.  Patch 
merging is largely automated by scripts these days, and failing to 
provide an adequate description means manual intervention is required.
The full body of your email is pasted into the BitKeeper changeset 
description.
