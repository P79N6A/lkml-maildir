If you try it you'll find it works fine until a write from the linux client
is too big to do in one go , the client then adjusts for the partial write
but when the socket layer calls back and says "more room" it doesnt
for some reason wake up the rpc to continue the write - the timer does
and that then works. So it goes but very slowly.
I dug into this a bit but failed to find a bug before I ran out of time. I
did prove the message from the socket layer arrives right.
