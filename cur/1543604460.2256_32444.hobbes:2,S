Hi,
My testcase was indeed one large file. I did not test lots of small
files. It would always lockup after said amount of traffic, but only in
10 Mbit half duplex mode. Also, I have the 82557, not the 82558 chip.
The problem looks a lot like what should be fixed in this changelog line
from 2.4.9-ac13:
- Work around eepro100 bug with some chip		(Arjan van de
Ven)
  versions on 10Mbit half duplex
Only 2.4.10ac11 still had the problem...
