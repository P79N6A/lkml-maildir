I have been working with SCI since 1994.  The people who own 
Dolphin and the SCI chipsets also own TRG.  We dropped work in 
the P6 ccNUMA cards several years back because Intel was 
convinced that shared-nothing was the way to go (and it is).
However, SCI's ability to create explicit sharing makes it
the fastest shared nothing interface around for message passing
(go figure).
I think we do need some bettr APIs.  Grab the source at my FTP server,
and I'd love any input you could provide.
Thanks,
