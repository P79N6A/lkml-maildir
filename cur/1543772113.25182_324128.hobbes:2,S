Not ideal, but not *that bad* if there is a standard way to stick the
data on the initrd image.  Its annoying to have to do it, but it does
enable the most usage models and allows the network to be brought up as
early as possible--which other components in the system may be relying on.

It defaults to enabled, so you just need to do:
    insmod ipw2100
and it will auto associate with an open network.  For the use case where
users want the device to load but not initialize, they can use
    insmod ipw2100 disable=1
If hotplug and firmware loading worked early in the init sequence, no
one would have issue with the current model; it works as users expect it
to work.  It magically finds and associates to networks, and your
network scripts can then kick off DHCP, all with little to no special
crafting or utility interfacing.
