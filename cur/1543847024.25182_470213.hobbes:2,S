I confirmed I get the exact same behavior with 2.6.18-mm3 and ext3..
So I don't think XFS is the problem.
Its _really_ annoying that the box is more stable under windows then
linux :-(  Is there anything I can do to help narrow it down?  The
configs are the same as in the previous post, except this time I
booted with 2.6.18-mm3.  I suspect a SATA problem, but I'm unsure what
to test?  should I try booting with acpi=off? or maybe disabling
(l?)apic stuff?  I don't have any idea what boot options are
relavent...Given it only flakes under 'heavy' load, could it be
interrupt related?
