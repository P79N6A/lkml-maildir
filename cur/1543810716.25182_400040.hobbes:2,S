Motivated by:

The effect is simply that if you boot with SELinux enabled but no policy
loaded and create a file in that state, SELinux won't try to set a
security extended attribute on the new inode on the disk.  This is the
only sane behavior for SELinux in that state, as it cannot determine the
right label to assign in the absence of a policy.  That state usually
doesn't occur, but the rawhide installer seemed to be misbehaving
temporarily so it happened to show up on a test install.
