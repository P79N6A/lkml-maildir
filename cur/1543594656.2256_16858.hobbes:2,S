I have almost the same problem, I am using a cramfs root filesystem, not a
ramdisk cramfs. When I use the very same content on ext2 mounted read-only
everything work as expected, but with cramfs some daemons don't start
(mingetty for example)... 
I mount tmpfs in /tmp and files touched in /var are symlinks to files in
/tmp... 
I don't have a clue of what goes wrong, hints a more than welcome ;)
linux is 2.4.5-ac15+patch for cramfs by Daniel Quinlan+Mathias
