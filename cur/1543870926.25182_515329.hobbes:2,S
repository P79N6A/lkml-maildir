I have one serial port in the system, it shares console, and the 
communications port for the application. (But I guess that is besides the 
point).
When the common serial core initialises the UART, and sees that it has the 
capability to do HW flow control - it enables it, asserting the pin, even if 
I don't want it at that moment in time.
The real issue is that there is some legacy equipment, which gets confused if 
it sees glitches on RTS (which happens today, when serial core init asserts 
RTS, and then the the main application turns it off)...
How do I set the set up the UART, so RTS is avaliable, but not enabled?
Thanks
