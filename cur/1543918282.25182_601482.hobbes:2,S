Difference between tmy_alloc() and kmalloc() are
  tmy_alloc() allows administrator know "how much memory is used by TOMOYO Linux modules"
  via /sys/kernel/security/tomoyo/meminfo interface.
  This feature was requested by TOMOYO Linux users.
  /proc/slabinfo can show how much memory is used by all modules,
  but it cannot show how much memory is used by TOMOYO Linux modules.
  tmy_alloc() can indicate memory-leaking bug and can avoid double-kfree() bug
  by keeping the pointer returned by kmalloc() in a local "cache_list" list.
  tmy_alloc() also keeps the size of memory allocated by kmalloc() in "cache_list" list
  so that administrator can know "how much memory is used by TOMOYO Linux modules".
  Calling ksize() after kmalloc() in tmy_alloc() and
  calling ksize() before kfree() in tmy_free() might be better
  if double-kfree-checks and memory-leaking-checks (i.e. "tmy_cachep") are unneeded.
Regards.
