Hi,
I have written a kernel module and I can load (insmod)
it without any error. But when i run my module it gets
seg fault at interruptible_sleep_on_timeout();
I have used this function in the following way:
DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(wq);
init_waitqueue_head(&wq);
interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&wq, 2);
I am using redhat version 9.0 and kernel version
2.4.20-8.
Could you please give some light on this issue?
