Back in 2000 there were a lot of version problems between ksymoops and
libbfd and libiberty, so I statically link against these libraries when
I build the rpm.  You have an i386 version of ksymoops, which was built
against an i386 only version of libbfd, it does not support target
elf64-x86-64.  Grab the ksymoops src.rpm and rebuild on x86_64, or use
a binary rpm from an x86_64 distribution.
