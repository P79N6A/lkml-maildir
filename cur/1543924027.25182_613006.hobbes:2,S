It could be done, but I don't find it preferable for this purpose.
Although the struct members in question are basically part of fw-core's
API (kernel-internal API), there won't be a lot of places which access
these members.
(Besides, lockless algorithms are essential to FireWire driver code
everywhere where CPU and controller interact.  So IMO these lockless
accesses don't constitute a whole new level of complexity in these drivers.)

So far I tended to disagree every time when checkpatch.pl bugged me
about barriers without comments.  But maybe that was because I had a
wrong idea of what kind of comment should go there.  There would
certainly be no value in a comment which effectively says "trust me, I
know we need a barrier here".  However, thinking about it again, it
occurs to me that I should add the following comments:
  1.) At respective struct type definitions:  A comment on how struct
      members are to be accessed and why.
  2.) At the occurrences of rmb() and wmb():  A comment on which
      accesses the particular barrier divides.  This is in order to get
      the barriers properly updated (i.e. moved or removed) when
      surrounding code is reordered, APIs reworked, or whatever.
Of course this division of the Why and the What only applies to accesses
like those in the patch --- i.e. API-like data types which aren't
abstracted by accessor functions --- while there may be other
requirements on comments for other usage types of barriers.
Or am I still wrong in my judgment of how barriers should be documented?

That's right.  Of course the wmb()s don't make sense if the reader side
isn't fixed up accordingly.  I did this for all places which I spotted
yesterday in the patches
"firewire: fw-core: react on bus resets while the config ROM is being
fetched", 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/31/464
  (Hmm, this has an unclear
changelog.)
"firewire: fw-sbp2: enforce read order of device generation and node
ID", 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/31/465
I didn't fold all these patches into one because these two other patches
include also other changes to the respective read sides.  I should have
pointed this out in this first patch.
Also, it could be that I have overlooked one more reader last night; I
will reexamine it.

Hmm, right.  Looks like the smp_ variants are indeed the right thing to
do here.

Oops, this happened when I worked on what became the "fw-core: react on
bus resets..." patch.  So the diffstat is wrong but...

...the diff is what I intended.  Anyway, maybe I should make it a habit
to send patches only between 10 AM and 10 PM local time.  :-)
