This is what ext2 will fix instantly.  If there are no outstanding journal
transactions for a filesystem (i.e. quiescent filesystem), fsck time is
basically zero for a filesystem no matter how big it is.  No point in
hacking something new in at this time for a problem that has already been
solved, IMHO.
Cheers, Andreas
