I just checked out the bk2 snapshot and its diffs with our latest
prism54 tree. Here is the diff:
http://prism54.org/~mcgrof/bk2-up.diff
It seems jgarzik took a patch before 2004-03-09 changes and just nuked
WDS code. It's great that it's already on some official kernel snapshot 
patch but prism54 driver project is a very active project and I think
someone jumped the gun. We were preparing the driver for proper
integration per the nevdev list discussion. Anyway, now onto dealing
with it.
Regarding WDS on prism54: on the netdev list we discussed this
but no one got back to me as to whether we should really just nuke this
code. Prism54 driver source *does* include WDS support because hey, the
firmware does. Why wouldn't it go in the driver? We haven't given WDS
much though anyway since it's also been low priority on our TODO list.
Is it already agreed among kdevelopers that even if certain chipsets
support WDS at the hardware/firmware level that another layer is going
to be used for it's support?
Now that prism54 driver is in bk2 if we (prism54 team) want to submit
patches for it, should we always patch against the latest bk snapshot?
Oh and if you get messages telling you your post is pending approval on
the prism54 list because you're not registered, don't worry, we're quick.
