Well, I haven't forgotten, but I am having a difficult time figuring out
what your real (most likely just one or two) essential requirements are.
A few days ago, you provided a six step list, under the introduction:

I suspect those six steps were not really your essential requirements,
but one possible procedure that accomplishes them.
So far I am guessing that your requirement(s) are one or both of the
following two items:
 (1) avoid having the scheduler wasting too much time trying to
     load balance tasks that only turn out to be not allowed on
     the cpus the scheduler is considering, and/or
 (2) provide improved administrative control of a system by being
     able to construct a cpuset that is guaranteed to have no
     overlap of allowed cpus with its parent or any other cpuset
     not descendent from it.
If (1) is one of your essential requirements, then I have described a
couple of implementations that mark some existing cpusets to form a
partition (in the mathematical sense of a disjoint covering of subsets)
of the system to define isolated scheduler domains.  I did this without
adding any additional bitmasks to each cpuset.
If (2) is one of your essential requirements, then I believe this can be
done with the current cpuset kernel code, entirely with additional user
level code.

Good.
Hopefully, you will also be able to get through my thick head what you
essential requirement(s) is or are.
