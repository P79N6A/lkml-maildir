 While I have not officially undertaken maintenance of code to support any
of the pieces of hardware relevant to the SWARM board, I have done a
considerable number of changes throughout all the bits and if you have any
concern related to this piece of code (or any other I am referring to
here), then you are certainly welcome to contact me directly, cc-ing
linux-mips, perhaps.  I do SWARM development solely in my free time and I
simply cannot afford chasing all the bits around, especially ones I do not
actively use.  I do try to care about bits other people have concerns
about though.
