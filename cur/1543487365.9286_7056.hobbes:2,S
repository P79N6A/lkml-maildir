This is the point Linux is about to actually use the disk, so it asks the
controller to lock the door (so the little button doesnt work).

Check the CD drawer is ok. The controller may get a little confused if
it takes too long to lock. I can't see 20 seconds being to short - thats
enough to close the CD drawer as well as lock it

Does FreeBSD lock the door in that case - if you push the little button
does the CD just come out
