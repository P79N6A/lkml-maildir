I think I'm headed in the right direction, this kernel now has the 
AMD/nforce stuff builtin alongside the VIA.  Invisible  
to /var/log/dmesg.
Both cpu's are athlon XP's but the new one is 2x faster, besides, I 
was losing ground at setiathome, all the new hardware was passing me.  
Gotta play catchup. :-)
Thanks Markus
