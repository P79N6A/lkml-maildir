I knew about AIO and O_DIRECT, but I thought FIO was using it by default :)
I used it for the first time yesterday night, and there are a pretty wide 
set of options. Will re-run today with --direct.
I was pretty surprised though. Since libaio was matching with syslets, I 
was thinking that a userspace version using a queue-always design (hard to 
do the cachehit optimization if you're not inside the scheduler ;), was 
going to be considerably slower.

Well, you do have your own HAVE_*, you just need to make autoconf/automake 
do the checks for you. Of course, then you'll be pissed every time an 
autoconf/automake update break your setup, but lately it seems to be going 
better. Really :)
