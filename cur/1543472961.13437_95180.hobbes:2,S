In 2.0, mem.c has this:
    #define  read_full    read_null
In 2.1, it has been changed:
    #define  read_full    read_zero
So, it looks like everybody is right.  Depends on which kernel you run.  :)
The lesson here, is to use /dev/zero when you mean it, and /dev/null
when you mean it, and don't use /dev/full for anything useful.  :)
