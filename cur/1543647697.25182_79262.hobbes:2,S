The new size limits are those of the Linux VFS layer (we use 64 bit 
numbers most places so that if we port to another architecture, or ia64 
becomes viable....).   I don't think anyone will find them motivating.  
Dramatic performance gains while offering transactional FS operations 
(wandering logs work, woohoo!), plugins, scalability due to per node 
locking, obsoleting a whole slew of traditional database tree algorithms 
for better performance, those are motivating.  Wait for Linux Journal to 
come out, it will have the benchmarks, and you'll see what I mean by 
dramatic.   It will be good enough that we can focus mostly on getting 
the semantics in place for the competition with OFS.
