The output from dmsetup table looks different in 2.6 anyway (at least on
my system?), something like: 0 12582912 linear hda7 384
When you have a target that uses another device-mapper device it says
something like dm-5. dmsetup load doesn't like that one.
(BTW: Before 2.5.69 it looked like ide0(3, 7) or something, I don't
remember exactly. My lilo-devmapper patch tries to parse all three
formats, and also fails on things like dm-5...)
