    For me, it doesn't work at all with ide-scsi in 2.6. 2.4 is fine
    in that regard.
    Please fill the whole disk and then reread and compare via ide-scsi.
    That never worked for me in 2.6 using ide-scsi, but it does work
    with the patch in -mm.
Yes, you are right. Yesterday night I tried a small amount of I/O,
and that worked fine, but today the kernel couldn't cope with a diff
between two 640MB trees.
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 6b6b6b6b.
Followed by a bad kernel crash (vanilla 2.6.1).
OK. So, just like the rumours said already, ide-scsi is badly broken.
Since small amounts of I/O work - a race somewhere? bad locking?

    There is a patch by me with some rework by Jens Axboe in -mm that
    corrects this situation. It hasn't seen much testing, though.
OK, will find that and try later.
    By the way, what hardware sector size does your MO use? I have
    only tested my patch with 2048 byte sector size - everything else
    is unlikely to work with ide-cd...
It uses media with 512-byte and media with 2048-byte sectors.

    I agree that the situation in mainline as it is now is undesirable,
    only mounting prewritten discs read-only works.
Yes. We must find out what is wrong in ide-scsi and fix it.
