I repeat: why last? What if there's a read-only user that has the thing
open for some reason, like gathering statistics every once in a while with
ioctl's or whatever?
That "last" is a bug.

Agreed. But you should NOT make that a special case.
I'm saying that you can, and should, just _unconditionally_ call
	invalidate_device()
which in turn will walk the buffer cache for that device, and try to throw
it away.
With the simple (again unconditional) addition of: If it cannot throw it
away because it is pinned through bh->b_count, it knows somebody is using
the buffer cache (obviously), so regardless of _what_ kind of user it is,
be it a direct-io one or a magic kernel module or whatever, it does
	lock_buffer(bh);
	if (!buffer_dirty(bh))
		submit_bh(bh, READ);
	else {
		/* we just have to assume that the aliasing is ok */
		unlock_buffer(bh);
	}
UNCONDITIONALLY.
Without caring about things like "is there a filesystem mounted". No
silly rules. The _only_ rule becomes: "try to make the buffer cache as
up-to-date as possible".
See? I'm saying that your approach tries to make decisions that it just
should not make. It shouldn't care or know about things like "a filesystem
has this device mounted".  It should do _one_ thing, and one thing only:
"somebody has written to the device through the page cache, let's try to
invalidate or re-validate as much of the buffer cache as humanly
possible".
Special-case code is bad. Always doing the same thing is good.
