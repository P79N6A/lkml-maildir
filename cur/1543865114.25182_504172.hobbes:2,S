I don't understand that comment.

And here is the proof that it's *userspace* which is effecting this change.
If "sys_ioctl" is the very first function in the list then that's a result
of some userspace process issuing an ioctl.

Shells typically alter the termios settings - eg, to turn off echo while
they're waiting for command input.  When command input has finished (by
pressing the enter key) they typically turn it back on.
Changing the termios settings while the shell is waiting for input is not
something they expect to happen, and this is the kind of behaviour I'd
expect in this scenario.

Ho hum.  Guess you're in for a long investigation then. 8/
