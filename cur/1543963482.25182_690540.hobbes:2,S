Well, it turns out that Ingo's fixed statistics actually put the real cost 
in fcntl/ioctl/open/release:
    310  down <= lock_kernel <= sys_fcntl <= system_call_after_swapgs <
    332  down <= lock_kernel <= vfs_ioctl <= do_vfs_ioctl <
    380  down <= lock_kernel <= tty_release <= __fput <
    422  down <= lock_kernel <= chrdev_open <= __dentry_open <
rather than the write routines. But it may be that Ingo was just profiling 
two different sections, and it's really all of them.
