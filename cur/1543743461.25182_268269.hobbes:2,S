For the most part, yes. I reran the test with -V0.7.7 and had continuous
ping responses until the system locked up with yet another deadlock. This
did NOT fix the display / mouse movement lockups. All IRQ and ksoftirqd
tasks were RT 99 priority for this test. latencytest ran at RT 30 priority.
The response time while RT was active looked like this...
# ping dws77
PING dws77 (192.52.216.87) from 192.52.215.17 : 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from dws77 (192.52.216.87): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=0.590 ms
64 bytes from dws77 (192.52.216.87): icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=0.468 ms
64 bytes from dws77 (192.52.216.87): icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=0.542 ms
64 bytes from dws77 (192.52.216.87): icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=0.492 ms
Note the response times are about 2x what I saw with the other kernels.
The max delay was about 200 msec.
The deadlock was between the two ksoftirqd tasks...
===============================================
BUG: circular semaphore deadlock detected!

ksoftirqd/1/6 is deadlocking current task ksoftirqd/0/3
1) ksoftirqd/0/3 is trying to acquire this lock:

.. held by:       ksoftirqd/1/    6 [dff866f0,   0]

2) ksoftirqd/1/6 is blocked on this lock:

Appears that both were working on network operations concurrently.
Will send the full serial console log separately.
