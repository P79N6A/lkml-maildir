Subject: Difference between 2.0.36 and 2.2.0pre3 ?

i got this strange problem while untarring a complete source-tree.
when i untarred it with a 2.0.36-kernel it took about a minute (what was
normal) but when i tried to untar it on my 2.2.0-pre3 it took +-5 sec for
just a couple of files... (i was pretty much bored after a minute, it
would have been busy for an hour or so) and since the difference was this
big, it must have been IDE, right ? (all 2.2.0 suffered from the same
'delay')
wrong ;) stracing tar pointed out that is got something to do with sockets
;/ from some strange (to me) reason it opens a socket (sunrpc ? tar ??) on
interface lo and repeats this for every +-5 files ;(
and 2.0.36 didn't show this behaviour, in fact, it does everything exactly
the same, but it delays less long. (in fact you don't notice it)

select(1024, [4], NULL, NULL, {5, 0} <unfinished ...>
^^^^^^here it delay's for +-5 secs for each couple of files with 2.2.0pre3
my system is a plain redhat 5.2 with the newer packages as described in
the Documentation/Changes. if you need more information... ;)
