Untill the net-stats are 64-bit on 32-bit systems, we will need some
way to know if they have wrapped or not when reading from nettool
and getting 64-bit numbers.
I guess what I really mean to say is that, if nettool is returning 64-bit
values, we need to know which ones are obtained from 32-bit counters.
32 -> 64 bit mapping will require wrap handling on low 32-bits, but
64 -> 64 bit mapping will require wrapping about 4-billion times less often :)
Perhaps a precision field is also needed for backwards/forwards compatability,
and perhaps a nettool version field as well to also help with backwards/forwards
compat.
