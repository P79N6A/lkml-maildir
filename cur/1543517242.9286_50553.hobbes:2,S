You're right. I'm not trying to make a distro war. I'm only saying that bugs
found in *any* distro which can result in data loss, should be *explicitly*
mentionned, we have very good reports for security issues, but none about
data integrity. I know linux-kernel has nothing to do with Linux in business,
so I apologize and add an [off topic] in the subject.
