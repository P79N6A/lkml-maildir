This is precisely the problem. Think for a while about what nohide
does, and how fattr.fileid interacts with inode numbers. nohide is
broken for exactly the same reason as unfsd is when used to export
multiple filesystems with one NFS export.

It's to do with how NFS write requests interact with the server's
filesystem block size. XFS uses 4K so you should set the NFS block
size to a low multiple of 4K for good performance.
