I'm testing the 2.4.27 kernel on an IBM ThinkCentre A30 Desktop.  The
system has a P4 2.8Ghz processor, 512 Megs of ram and IDE disk.  The
clock on the system is very much off.  Using the "/bin/date" command
it seems to actually count 1 second for every 10 or so.  Under load
this can be even slower.  I've reproduced this on 3 separate pieces of
hardware.
Has anyone run into this or have an idea?  My next step is to try an
older kernel with the same config but that may take a bit to get built
and tested.
