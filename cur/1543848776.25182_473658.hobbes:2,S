That may be what happens in *your* kernel, but does it happen upstream?
Because I expect this patch would fix the problem
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=408d85441cd5a9bd6bc851d677a10c605ed8db5f
(together with the zone_near_oom thing)

Maybe there is an occasional GFP_NOFS reclaimer, and the workload 
involves a huge
number of easy to reclaim inodes. If there are some GFP_KERNEL 
allocators (or kswapd)
that are otherwise making a meal of this work, then we don't want to 
start swapping
stuff out.
Hypothetical maybe, but you can't just make the assertion that it is 
just silly,
because that isn't clear. And it isn't clear that your patch fixes anything.

So... presumably next time, we will try harder?

So, what kernel did you test?
