One of the problems I have to deal with is namespaces. This means I can't just
have an automounter running in userspace that's passed requests to mount
things as it might not be able to access the target namespace.
Doing it this way means that I don't need to care which namespace the
automount needs to take effect in. I can just return a vfsmount to the VFS (as
acquired from do_kern_mount()) and let that paste it into the right place.
Furthermore, for AFS at least, it's a lot less excessive than, say, calling
back into userspace.

How? I want to be able to mount on the location in question (so it has to be a
directory), but I don't want "ls -l" to cause it to mount (otherwise
accidentally doing that or tab expansion if /afs, say, will take ages).
Maybe you mean construct a symlink that points to somewhere I can actually
mount the filesystem? If so, that too can suffer from namespace problems.
Whatever happens, stat() must _not_ cause the automount point to mount.

Do you mean dispose of the expired mount point when it's next revalidated? If
so, surely you _don't_ want to do it then, as that's normally a prelude to
reusing it.
Or do you mean do it actually inside dentry->d_op->d_revalidate()? But you
can't do it there because you don't know what vfsmount you are dealing with.

Duplicate of what bookkeeping?
The fact that the operation is provided indicates that a dentry is an
automount point, and as such should be handled specially by path-walk. All the
logic to link the new vfsmount into the filesystem topology can be handled
easily by the VFS at that point because all the details are to hand.

What do you mean by safely? I check that the usage count on vfsmount
structures is 1 under lock just before unlinking it - thereby making sure that
no one has a file open on it, no process has it as its root or cwd, and that
nothing is mounted upon it.
Also, I do the actual unmounting from process context by walking the
namespace's extant mount list, rather than directly nominating a vfsmount for
removal.
One drawback is that - taking AFS as an example - doing a umount of /afs won't
work until all the subtrees have either been manually unmounted or have
expired (though I can make umount capable of handling this).

What do you mean by a partial unmount?
