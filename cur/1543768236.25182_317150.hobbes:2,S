Yes, even if you think of the whole file system as a single "file", you
need a way to select the bit you need, and you will use names for that
(and whether you call that a filename, a file-part name or an object
name doesn't really matter).
It is interesting that both he and I gave the example of a book and
chapters, which is essentially a linear sequence, and the issue was just
the selection of a part of that sequence. It would also be interesting
to think about how you could map an arbitrary data structure more
complicated than a linear sequence (an "object") to disk. This brings up
issues of serialization and object databases....
