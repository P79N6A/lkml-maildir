It seems we do not always agree.  ;-)
I did consider gcc 4 support in kernel 2.4 more dangerous and you do 
consider this more dangerous than I do.
I can always be proved wrong by getting reports from people that I broke 
their setups. If you know someone whose setup I broke, please tell him 
to inform me about this fact.
That zero feedback is good feedback is my experience since the times 
when I offered packages to run kernel 2.4 on Debian 2.2, and later 
packages to run kernel 2.6 on Debian 3.0 - I got almost zero feedback 
except for the one time when an update removed /etc/services ...

I know that ATA is an area that requires extra care (and I don't plan 
any big updates in this area).
But having:
- two saa7134 cards in your computer and
- one of them formerly not supported and
- depending on one of them being the first one
is a case you can theoretically construct, but then there's the point 
that this is highly unlikely, and OTOH the value of the added support is 
more realistic.
If I was as extremely regarding regressions as you describe regarding 
hardware updates, I would also have to reject any bugfixes that are not 
security fixes since they might cause regressions.
I do know that the only value of the 2.6.16 tree lies in a lack of 
regressions and act accordingly, but I'm trying to do this in a 
pragmatic way.
