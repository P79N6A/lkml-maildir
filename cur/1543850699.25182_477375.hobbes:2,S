None of this really looks like -rc3 material.  Why do you think it's
serious enough to justify late inclusion?
I'm not particularly fussed about UBD though - if you and Jeff particularly
want this lot in 2.6.19 then the world won't end.
"[PATCH 03/11] uml ubd driver: var renames" didn't apply due to
dummy_device_release not being present, which doesn't inspire confidence. 
What tree are you patching?
