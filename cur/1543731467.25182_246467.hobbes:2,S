Please explain your problems.  I've not seen a single actually working
proposal yet.  Current reiser4 implementation apparently oopses and
breaks guaranteed fs semantics, it's not going in in either reiser4 or
the vfs.
Al has started a thread to hash out working semantics, but there's not been
a single namesys person involved.  Similar all of you have absolutely ignore
every single technical question or comment but started a flamefest
consisting mostly of personal attacs and "mine is longer" politics.
