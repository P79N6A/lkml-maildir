Correct.  But the GPL code is still there, and that's what it's all
about.

No.  Read clause 3 of the GPL.  Distributions of executables generated
from GPL code require it to be accompanied either with the source or a
written offer for the source.  They have to make the offer, not wait for
email.
If they go for the written offer, they have to distribute the sources
themselves.  Referring to those sources from which you got the
unmodified code is only valid for noncommercial distribution (clause
3.c).  Selling a hardware/software combination looks quite commercial to
me.
It's the distributors task to offer the source, not the receiver's to
find out by luck that there is GPL'd code in the product so that they
may ask for source.
