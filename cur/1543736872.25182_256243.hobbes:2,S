Indeed, for read you're returning 0 now instead of the -EINVAL from common
code when no ->read is present.  I'd say the current drm behaviour is a bug,
but if X drivers rely on it.
Similar in poll your return 0 now while the generic code return
(POLLIN | POLLOUT | POLLRDNORM | POLLWRNORM) for fds without ->poll, and
again I'd say current drm behaviour could be considered a bug.
for ->flush there's no behaviour change of not supplying it.
