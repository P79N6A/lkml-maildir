the timeout of the kernel (which can be set from userspace) is for the
whole firmware loading process. What we talk about is waiting a little
bit before the files become visible for the firmware.agent.

The firmware.agent script has 3 extra lines to check for the visibility
of the "loading" file and if it is not present it will sleep one second.
This is a actual good practice compared to adding much more code to the
kernel and have an own way of running hotplug.
