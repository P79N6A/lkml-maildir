I assume you mean the call to add_wait_queue() there.  That does not
sleep.  Look at the implementation.  add_wait_queue() is defined in
kernel/fork.c -- it just does some locking and calls
__add_wait_queue().  __add_wait_queue() is really nothing more than 
a list_add().  There's nothing more to it and nothing that goes to
sleep.  Where do you think add_wait_queue() goes to sleep?

But there's only one thread around: the user space process that called
into the kernel via poll().  If the first driver goes to sleep, which
thread do you think is going to wake up and call into the second
driver?
