I think it's great that Oliver is volunteering to build this system,
host it, provide the build infrastructure and hardware, that's cool!  But
wouldn't it be a whole lot less work to tell people to type make before 
they send in the patch?
Doesn't it seem a bit strange to be building a system to make sure that
the people who submit patches have submitted patches which compile?
Is it really true that there are any significant number of patches
submitted that don't even compile?  
And while we are the build topic, what platforms get built?  What configs?

OK Socrates, nice try, but try and stay focussed and answer the question.
It's right there above your non-answer.
