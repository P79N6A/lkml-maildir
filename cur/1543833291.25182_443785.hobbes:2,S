I can't reproduce this on clean 2.6.18-rc1.

I have tried
#define SCAN_BLOCK_SIZE         2048
and
#define SCAN_BLOCK_SIZE         1024
Unfortunately it doesn't change anything.

Please try something like this
on tty1
isic -s rand -d your ip (
http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/ISIC/
)
on tty2
kml_collector (
http://www.stardust.webpages.pl/files/o_bugs/kml/ml/kml_collector.sh
)
(I have tried to read random files from /sys on vanilla kernel, but I
can't reproduce that lockup)
