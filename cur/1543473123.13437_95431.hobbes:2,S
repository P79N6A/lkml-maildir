   It looks OK, but I think it should use inverse_translate()
instead of conv_uni_to_pc().
   The conv_uni_to_pc() function converts Unicode to font encoding
as opposed to inverse_translate() which is an inversion of
translate[], therefore it converts Unicode to character set
used in userland.
				Have a nice fortnight
