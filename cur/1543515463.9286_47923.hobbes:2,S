I'm looking into this on PowerPC. Cort Dougan developed some code which
makes a cache of pre-zeroed pages, but very little in the kernel
actually uses them.
Using them for cow faults might be a big win on PPC, by saving us from
an expensive flush_page_to_ram(). The flush_page_to_ram() means that the
PowerPC can never find the same anonymous page already in the L2 cache.
(The PowerPC only really needs to flush executable pages, as the data
cache is coherent, but the instruction cache isn't. The kernel does not
make this distinction. Pre-zeroed pages have the advantage of being
already flushed. Some day I'll count how many unnecessary flushes happen
and decide if this is important.)
