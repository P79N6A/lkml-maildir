Yes sure, it should not be atomic. But (VALID && !PENDING) == BUG, so we
can't just "kill" PENDING form the check above.

yes, it is not very clear which "Memory operations" memory-barriers.txt
describes.

(To avoid a possible confusion: I am not arguing, I am trying to understand,
 and please also note "in _theory_" above)
Is it so? Shoudn't we document this if it is true?

Why? Could you please give a code example we have which relies on this?

Yes. But note that we don't have any reason to do set_wq_data() under
cwq->lock (this is also true for wake_up(->more_work) btw), so it makes
sense to do this change anyway. And "wmb + spin_lock" looks a bit strange,
I _suspect_ spin_lock() means a full barrier on most platforms.
Could you also look at
