not really a regression but a long-standing inconvenience/bug of the debug 
symbols of relocatable kernels. (ever since relocatable kernels were added 
in '06 or so.) Nevertheless we queued up a revert of the defconfig change 
for .29, to not expose it in the defconfig:
 f269b07: x86: revert CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y defconfig change
so i think it can be taken off the regressions list.
