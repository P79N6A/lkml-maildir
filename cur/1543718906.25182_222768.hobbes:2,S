I don't think I've seen it before.
For the last two years, you can find a lot of email addresses in BK, and 
you can clean them up with the name translations found in the "shortlog" 
script (part of "BK-tools" at 
http://bktools.bkbits.net/bktools
).

Well, right now you won't get any real information from the sign-off
lines, since only a few people have started using it (7 people at the time
of this writing ;), so you're better off just doing statistics on the 
output of "bk changes -a" or something.
