In the case of PCI (am no big expert on this)- I believe the code
allows you to address 32 bits at a time...you can see the the 
effectve address resource address is some where around 
0xea900000 - but, if you have PHYS_64BIT  & PTE_64BIT - 
you get resource_types of 64bits...that you can manipulate accordingly.
 
In the case of the eDMA - its 64bit dma operations - thus, you 
setup the hi portion (by shifting twice by 16 (you get compiler 
warnings if you try to shiftg the size of the offset - a bug IMHO))
and thus, can play the game I mentioned below and use the power 
of the PEX inbound/outbound translation windows to move your data 
correctly to the appropriate 32 bit location...
 
This game works fine very well for 2.6.11 + kernel  - there are a few 
more tests I need to do (like setting mem=<just below the PEX space> 
and see if it works correctly...and then try again just a little bit above 
PEX memory space (> ~0xea900000) - if it works below & doesn't work
above - it points to a problem with sata_mv doing some type of operation
outside the dma engine that is corrupting memory - 
 
Thats another issue how does memory dribble/scribbling (only side affect 
I can think of if something is going wrong with this translation)?
 
I'll try your 'patch' and see if that has any affect as well (and the
associated side-affects...)

I don't know much about how 32-bit PPC deals with memory addresses
that are more than 32-bits..
But does this patch have any effect:
