Plenty of people replied with positive reviews when it was posted
earlier. I'd expect that you'd have a fair bit of ram, so you're less
likely to observe any benefit, as you wouldnt be digging into swap as
often as those on lesser systems.

Con's patchset is used pretty widely now, with many distro's (Arch,
Mandriva, PCLinuxOS among others) providing prebuilt kernels and
nobody has reported any drawbacks. I don't think anyone in -mm has
reported any either.
