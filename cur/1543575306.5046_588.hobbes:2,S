I don't remember having the same problem months (6?) ago when
I built my first Kernel with this enabled (well, maybe I never
touched the key).
When built into the Kernel, by only pressing the
PrintScreen/SysRq the current application is terminated (tested
on a console and GNU screen). Is this just me or I should
expect it?

While running the application I press the key and you see the
result. It's very annoying because I accidentaly keep touching
it.
Kernel 2.2.17 on x86 (br-abnt2 keyboard, kbd 1.03). glibc 2.2,
but Kernel compiled with egcs 1.1.2.
The SysRq stuff works:
