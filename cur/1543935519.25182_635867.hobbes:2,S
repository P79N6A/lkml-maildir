As Andy say, reset the counts using tune2fs, then make sure they are
actually reset.  I've been using ext3 for a long time and even with
crashes, it's been good about coming up and replaying the journal
nicely.
Again, we can't tell much without boot logs.

I use a Sil 3112 as well for some of my disks (I've got six, two each
of SCSI, PATA and SATA) and it all works well.  So does an ancient but
upto date Debian Unstable install running 2.6.24-rc6, so it's not
impossible to install new kernels on old systems.  
Get rid of initrd and you should be all set.  But again, without
details we can't really help.

So reboot it before you goto bed tonight and tell us what it says in
the morning.  Esp in terms of the filesystems and their counts.
Hmm... but thinking about it, you're running 2.4.x something, and
there were bugs back then with ext3, so you just might be hitting some
of those bugs.  Can you goto the latest 2.4.x release?
