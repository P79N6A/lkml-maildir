Debian is distibution; distributions are _expected_ to fix bugs (etc)
in their packages.
If distribution had all packages unmodified, it would be useless...
So I'd expect all distros to have at least some changes in their
kernel... the same way I expect distros to have some patches in
midnight commander etc.
Of course it is good to keep the .diff as small as possible.
