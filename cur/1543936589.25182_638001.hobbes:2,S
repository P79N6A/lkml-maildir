hm, did you understood my .25 reference to mean 2.6.25-final? I meant 
2.6.25-rc1. Or if there's a 2.6.24-rc8 planned then we could put it in 
right now [with the bisectability fixes, i.e. not the original series]. 
I.e. IMO what we shouldnt do is to put in these fixes without having had 
_some_ -rc release inbetween.
