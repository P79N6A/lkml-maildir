If you look at the code, I do not set the NV_TX2_VALID bit (stored in 
np->tx_flags) in the first tx descriptor until all other descriptors for 
this transmit are setup. This ensures hardware will not look at it. Once 
all fragments/descriptors are setup, I setup the control bits for the 
first tx descriptor. This includes any TSO (or checksum) info and the 
Valid bit. Hardware now knows that it is valid and can proceed.
