Yes, that is what would happen.
Now you could get into a deadlock by trying something pathilogical like:
	rmmod usb-hcd < /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/idVendor
but hey, if you do that, you deserve the deadlock :)
(and yes, I know you can do this for network devices, but they have
their own thread/timer/something to prevent this deadlock from
happening...)

That's a good thing to do.  It should work.

No, the bug should be fixed.  I've seen this bug happen if someone has a
usb-serial device open and then unload the host controller driver.  In
fact, I think there's a bugzilla entry just for that...
Yeah, here it is:

The very same oops you are seeing.
So no, it's not your fault.  We need to fix the real problem.

No problem, thanks for reminding me about this.
