Anything that uses something like file1.st_dev==file2.st_dev &&
file1.st_ino==file2.st_ino to decide if two filenames point to the
same file can get terribly confused.  For example,
$ ls -li .snapshot/hourly.0/.zshrc .zshrc
1411878 -rw-r--r--    1     1247 Mar 19  2001 .snapshot/hourly.0/.zshrc
1411878 -rw-r--r--    1     1248 Dec 14 09:51 .zshrc
Clearly, the file has been modified since the hourly.0 snapshot; however
$ cp .snapshot/hourly.0/.zshrc .zshrc
cp: `.snapshot/hourly.0/.zshrc' and `.zshrc' are the same file
you can't copy the snapshot on top of the current version, since they
have the same inode number.  A somewhat contrived example, perhaps,
but I have been bitten by something similar in the real world.  One of
the things I would like to be able to do with a snapshot is to open a
file in emacs, open a snapshot in another window, and compare the two
files with ediff.  And you can't; emacs treats the original and the
snapshot as if they were the same file - just like cp does - even
though the file contents are different.
