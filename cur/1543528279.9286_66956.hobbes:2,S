Andrey -
Not only the IP address is mangled, but I am guessing that the payload was as well.  Looking at the
frames that had the IP address fouled up, the sniffer reports that the checksum, length, source and
destination ports are all incorrect.
There are no reports about bad checksums in any log file on either the client or the server -
wouldn't the packet just be discarded since the destination address and port were incorrect?  I
wonder why the rest of the packet would be trashed but the destination MAC would be OK?
BTW - I'm glad that your patches are in 2.2.15, it helped with the damage control here.....
