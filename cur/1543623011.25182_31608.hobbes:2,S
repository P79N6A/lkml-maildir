Subject: early ioremap not working with 2.4.19-pre1-aa1 ?

I have code for the NUMA-Q systems that does an ioremap
as the first thing in smp_boot_cpus (ia32 tree). This seems to 
work fine until I install the aa patches ... then it hangs in the 
ioremap.
Has anyone got any idea why this might be? I'd really like to
test out the -aa vm patches on this box ... I can debug it some
more - just looking for an easy answer ;-)
Thanks,
Martin.
