can you check what's doing? reading or writing? I guess it's a kind of
workload that would seek all over the place.  However throughput should
be better with seeks now since I could grow the queue (if something only
latency would be worse but the above is a throughput thing only, latency
doesn't matter).
Can you retry once more time with pre2 vs pre6 to be 100% sure it's
reproducible?
thanks,
Andrea
