Actually there are several other reasons for it. It sucks a lot less
when you need to use ls and friends to inspect part of the spool. It
also makes it much easier to split the mail spool over multiple disks as
it grows without having to backup/restore the spool area

The UML tree and my tree don't quite merge easily. Your best bet is to
grab the Red Hat Limbo beta packages for the kernel source, which if I
remember rightly are both -ac based and include the option to build UML
