Subject: [PATCH] Fix out-by-one error in traps.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/30/267

We don't care if ebp is on the stack, we care about ebp + 4.  Without
this, lguest (with CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKDEP) can touch a page unmapped by
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.
