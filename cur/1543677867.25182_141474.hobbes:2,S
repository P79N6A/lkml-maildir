The variable isn't uninitialized, it is inherited from the parent.
Recall that the task_struct of the new child starts off as a duplicate
of the parent's. If the variables are not explicitly set, they remain
the same as the parent's.
So this patch ends up resetting the sleep_avg to zero, instead of being
the same as the parent, which may or may not result in better
performance.
