Rajesh,
It's possible that the current behavior is by design but once the driver is loaded with MSI, you need a reboot to be able to load MSI-X. And vice versa. I found this rather restrictive.
I did test the fix multiple times. For eg. multiple load/unload iterations of
MSI followed by multiple load/unload of MSI-X followed by load/unload MSI. That way both transitions(MSI-to-MSI-X and vice versa) are tested.
Thanks,
Ravi

The current MSI code actually does this deliberately, not by
accident. It's got a lot of complex code to track devices and
vectors and make sure an enable_msi -> disable -> enable sequence
gives a driver the same vector. It also has policies about
reserving vectors based on potential hotplug activity etc.
Frankly, I've never understood the need for such policies, and
am in the process of removing all of them.

This will break the existing MSI policies. Once you take that away,
a whole lot of additional code and complexity can be removed too.
That's what I'm working on right now, but such a change is likely
too big for -stable.
So, I'm ok with this patch if it actually doesn't break MSI/MSI-X.
Did you try to repeatedly load/unload an MSI capable driver with
this patch? Did you repeatedly try to ifdown/ifup an Ethernet
driver that uses MSI? I'm not in a position to test this today, but
will try it out next week.
thanks,
Rajesh
