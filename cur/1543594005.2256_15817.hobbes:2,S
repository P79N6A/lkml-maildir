There are a ton of these in the scsi code in Linus tree, Im still merging them
please grab the -ac patch before you waste time on this - there are about
30 or 40 of these already fixed.
The SCSI one is _much_ more problematic because there are pieces of quite high
level code that blindly assumed a scsi command alloc always works etc..
