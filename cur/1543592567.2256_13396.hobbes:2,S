The only case ksoftirqd runs is when the stock kernel does the wrong
thing and potentially delays the softirq of 1/HZ. Nothing else.
When current kernel does the right thing ksoftirq cannot generate any
scalability problem and furthmore ksoftirqd is a per-cpu thing so if you
face a scalability problem with it that simply means you need to fix the
scheduler because then it means you would face a scalability issue as
well every time a tux thread calls schedule().
90% of the time ksoftirqd will never run, when it runs it means you want
to pay for a scheduler run to get it running. The price of the scheduler
is just the price for the logic that balance the softirq load in a fair
manner and without buggy latencies.
