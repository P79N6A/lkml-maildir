As I said - that's going to cause _your_ kernel thread to be slowed down as
well.
I mean, it's just a choice between two ways of multiplexing the CPU.  One
is via a context switch in schedule() and the other is via list traversal
in run_workqueue().  The latter will be faster.

Maybe that's because the cbus data structures are insufficiently
percpuified.  On really big machines that single kernel thread will be a
big bottleneck.

You mean the
	interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&cbus_wait_queue, 10);
?  (That should be HZ/100, btw).
That seems a bit kludgy - someone could queue 10000 messages in that time,
although they'll probably run out of memory first, if it's doing
GFP_ATOMIC.
Introducing an up-to-ten millisecond latency seems a lot worse than some
reduction in peak bandwidth - it's not as if pumping 100000 events/sec is a
likely use case.  Using prepare_to_wait/finish_wait will provide some
speedup in SMP environments due to reduced cacheline transfers.

What is a "deferred insert work"?  Insertion is always synchronous?

But your current implementation has only one kernel thread?
