That is intentional. Memory is always present if you are on !NUMA. You can 
simply use a default nodemask where only node 0 is set. That is what the 
fallback provides. Maybe it does not provide the right thing for cpusets?

Looks like we need to fix cpuset nodemasks for the !NUMA case then?
It cannot expect to find valid nodemasks if !NUMA.

There is no point in having a variable if you know the results because of

Lets get either rid of the definitions for the nodemasks in the !NUMA 
case or fix their contents to have the right constant value expected in 
cpusets.
