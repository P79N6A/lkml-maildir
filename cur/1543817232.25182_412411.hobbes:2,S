Yes, it is rq.lock. Will add comment.

The function sched_info_on has only got a return statement so putting 
the unlikely within
it doesn't seem possible.
This is a rather aggressive use of the unlikely. In the case where 
CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS is
defined, sched_info_on always returns 1 so the unlikely will always 
cause a mispredict. I'm assuming
the extra penalty for that is acceptable for those using schedstats 
since its never turned on in a production
kernel.
If only CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT is configured, the value of delayacct_on, 
which is very
likely going to be 0, will be returned so the unlikely is potentially 
helpful to reduce overhead.
Thoughts ?
As I write this, I realize the function sched_info_on() is also wrongly 
written and doesn't account for the
case where both SCHEDSTATS and TASK_DELAY_ACCT  are configured. Will fix 
that. But thats
orthogonal to the above discussion of whether the unlikely should be used.
