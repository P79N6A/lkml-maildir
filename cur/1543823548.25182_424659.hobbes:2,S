What I did for time critical statistics in core vm paths is to use 
get_cycles() but associate each cycle value with a processor id when the 
measurements starts. If the processor id has changed when we end the 
measurement then discard the measurement and just note that we missed one.
Here is a piece of a description for a patch that I have used in the past 
for these statistics:
----
The patch puts three performance counters into critical kernel paths to 
show how its done.
The measurements will show up in /proc/perf/all. Processor specific 
statistics may be obtained via /proc/perf/<nr-of-processor>. Writing to 
/proc/perf/reset
will reset all counters. F.e.
echo >/proc/perf/reset
Sample output:
AllocPages               786882 (+  0) 9.9s(223ns/12.6us/48.6us) 12.9gb(16.4kb/16.4kb/32.8kb)
FaultTime                786855 (+192) 10.4s(198ns/13.2us/323.6us)
PrepZeroPage             786765 (+  0) 9.2s(549ns/11.7us/48.1us) 12.9gb(16.4kb/16.4kb/16.4kb)
The first countr is the number of times that the time measurement was 
performed.(+ xx) is the number of samples that were thrown away since the 
processor on which the process is running changed. Cycle counters are not 
consistent across different processors.
Then follows the sum of the time spend in the code segment followed in 
parenthesesby the minimum / average / maximum time spent there. The 
second block are the sizes of data processed. In this sample 12.9 GB was 
allocated via AllocPages. Most allocations were 16k = 1 page although 
there were also 32K (2 page) allocations.
