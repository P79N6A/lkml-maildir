Hi,
I'm seeing a constant leak in size-4096 on a machine running 2.4.20-18 SMP 
BIGMEM, which might / might not be related to the machine finally going out 
of memory and going into a hang.
I saw a discussion around similar problems in 2.6.0 (2.6.0-test5/6 (and 
probably 7 too) size-4096 memory leak - 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/10/17/5
 )
and an ext3 patch was suggested by Andrew Morton.
From a brief look the code in 2.4 it seems like the patch might be relevant 
here as well. Is the size-4096 leak a known issue for 2.4 ?
Is the 2.6 patch applicable in 2.4 as well ?
Thanks,
