Dennis wrote something called "streams" not be confused with "STREAMS".
He was trying to provide a more flexible mechanism for tty line 
disciplines.  The Sys III guys grabbed it and decided to promote it as 
a networking infrastructure, because System III et al did not have
networking.  Dennis doesn't like the result any better than any of us.
