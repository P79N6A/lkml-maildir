Subject: Linux 2.6.20-rc7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/30/500

Yes, I know I said I would only do -rc6 and then the final 2.6.20, but the 
thing is, the known regressions list didn't get whittled down as quickly 
as I hoped, and as a result we now have a -rc7.
It's in good enough shape that I'd probably have been happy to just 
release it as 2.6.20, but since I want 2.6.20 to be a stability release, I 
didn't want to risk any stupid bugs while the regressions got fixed, so 
here's a final -rc7.
In other words, please do give it a good testing. We should have fixed the 
nasty stuff on Adrian's list (and here's another thanks to Adrian for 
keeping me on my toes!) and it's all good. But please give it a quick 
shake-down to make sure that nothing silly happened while fixing the bad 
stuff.
The shortlog really does say most of it - this is just various fixes for a 
number of mostly fairly inconsequential things, but the SG_IO timeout bug 
that hit any NeroLinux user would quite possibly impact other DVD/CD 
reader/writer programs too that used raw commands with timeouts.
The diffstat just looks like line-noise: 244 files changed with an average 
of less than 10 lines per file changed in 179 commits. In other words, 
really no big diffs: it's just a lot of really small stuff.
