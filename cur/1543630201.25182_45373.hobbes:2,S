We tried disabling the elevator while doing Raw IO with DB2
a couple of weeks ago.  The database performance degraded much
more than expected.  Disks were FC connected Tritons or SCSI
connected ServerRaid (or both?).  Oracle often asks for a patch
to disable the elevator since they believe they can schedule IO
better.  We didn't try with Oracle in this case, but DB2 and RAW
IO without and elevator was not a good choice.
