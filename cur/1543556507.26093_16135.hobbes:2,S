I'm building boxes with the console set to /dev/ttyS0.  However, I can't
guarantee that there will always be a term plugged into the serial
port.  If there is no term on the port, eventually the buffer fills and
any processes that write to the console (i.e. init) block.  Is there some
option somewhere to stop this happening (i.e. either ignoring the
flow-control or just allowing the buffer to overflow)?
