{ I am not subscribed to linux-kernel, so be so kind to cc the replies
to me - although I will review the archives. I send this mail to report
that some problem still exists although it is considered to be solved }
I repeatably observe the effect of 'heavy kupdated' (kupdated taking
almost 100% CPU, computer not reacting - for a few seconds, happening 
from time to time). In the archives I found that this problem is
considered to be removed in 2.4.15per7
(
http://hypermail.idiosynkrasia.net/linux-kernel/archived/2001/week48/0147.html
). I use 2.4.18 and I still observe it.
Some (probably important) details:
- the effect happens in the particular case: when I perform large
copying over the local network (in fact it was sth like
    scp -r remote:/some/directory/tree ./ 
)
- I have a lot of RAM and there is a lot of free memory when the problem
is being observed
- I do not use any swap
- I use LVM (applied from lvm_1.0.5 as distributed by Sistina) and the
drive to which the copying occurs belongs to LVM volume group.
