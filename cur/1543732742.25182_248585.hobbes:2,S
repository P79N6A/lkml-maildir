I certainly have intensions of making test kernels available in my repository
in a separate testing branch. I don't really mind for myself what tree the
patch is based on, but I feel that the patches may get more testing if they
are against vanilla, rather than against another tree, as users 
may consider the patch to be more stable. On the other hand, it is not hard for
packagers like myself to do the leg work, and we can also provide a pre-patched
kernel source for those who still want to roll their own.

Well with Lee's help, I think I have identified an ICE1712 sound driver issue,
but this is yet to be determined.

I will go with whatever is decided, as I am prepared to do the legwork for my
repository users.
