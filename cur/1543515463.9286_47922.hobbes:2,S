kiobufs don't magically fix this.  If you want physically contiguous
pages, you need to allocate them contiguously in the first place.
kiobufs are intended as holders of pages, independent of the source of
those pages: you can map user space pages into a kiobuf or you can
allocate inside the kernel and populate the kiobuf with those pages
instead.

It is already in 2.3.
