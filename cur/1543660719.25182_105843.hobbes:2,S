No, but I can look into it. There is definitely some bug in my program
but I wouldn't expect this behaviour. So if I seek way the hell out
to nowhere, do a write, I'll have a file of the total amount I've skipped
over?
I just wrote a test program and it did exactly this. Thanks!
Here is the program
#define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
main()
{
int fd;
char buff[32];
	fd=open("/tmp/crazybigfile",O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE,0644);
	lseek64(fd,1000000000000ll,SEEK_SET);
	write(fd,buff,32);
	close(fd);
}
Live and learn. Sorry for the alarm!
