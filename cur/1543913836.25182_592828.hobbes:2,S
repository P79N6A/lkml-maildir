I am all for fixing the problem but the solution can be much simpler and 
more universal. F.e. the amount of tcp data in flight may be controlled 
via some limit so that other subsystems can continue to function even if 
we are overwhelmed by network traffic. Peter's approach establishes the 
limit by failing PF_MEMALLOC allocations. If that occurs then other 
subsystems (like the disk, or even fork/exec or memory management 
allocation) will no longer operate since their allocations no longer 
succeed which will make the system even more fragile and may lead to 
subsequent failures.
