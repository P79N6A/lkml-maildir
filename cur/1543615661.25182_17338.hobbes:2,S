Cool. Sorry it took so long to get it to you.  Just distracted by other 
things. (The patch was quick. Took less than 15 minutes to create and test. 
Remembering to do it was the hard part. ]:> )

Actually it was a very good meeting. (Randal Schwartz was speaking on the 
future of Perl.)  I wrote it during the "history of Perl" section, since I 
already knew that part. (Don't ask. A messy story involving mailing list 
maintence over a 28k connection.)  I am waiting to write the security 
exploits for part of it if they actually do some of the things he spoke of in 
Perl 6.  (User modifiable core code. Mmmm!)
Besides, some people only attend the meetings for the beer and/or cider 
afterwards...
