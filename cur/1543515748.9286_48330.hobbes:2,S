1) How do I open a port with a baud rate of 0? Indeed I have a few
serial ports that don't do exactly what they were designed to do, so I
also don't like the RTS signal doing funky stuff when I open the port
just to toggle the DTR signal...
(Did you know you can tie a led directly between a handshake signal
and ground? No extra components required! (Don't do this at home, this
violates ALL specs))
2) This sounds like an oversight in the driver. I mean I don't know 
about these semantics, and I write serial drivers....
