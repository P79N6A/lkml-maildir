   yes that's my fault.  i had an intermediate change i forgot about.
   this would be the correct diff for idt77105 --
When I reject a patch, I typically just delete everything you
sent me, so if you just resend one part of the fixed up patch
the rest gets lost.
Can you send the correct patch for all three drivers not just
the idt77105 parts?
It really isn't rocket science to send patches properly.  When I say
"didn't apply" it means it went to /dev/null and you have to send me
a new complete patch.
