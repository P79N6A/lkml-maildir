I don't know what interesting out-of-tree filesystems you
have in mind, but it looks like this would work for all
systems in the current tree.

Funny to hear that from you.

P.S. Now that you exist again, let me repeat a question
from a few weeks ago. Many years ago I constructed kdev_t,
a pointer to a struct containing the things that lived in
the arrays and some useful functions like a function returning
the name. It was passed around as reference to the device.
You are replacing kdev_t by struct block device *, that I
consider as a refcounted reference to the device. Fine.
But kdev_t is created by the driver, at the moment the
device is detected, while struct block device * is created
at open() time. Thus, the question arises where you plan to
store permanent device data like size or sectorsize.
