Bah. I think I was just fat-fingering something. Ok, so it does actually
work if I do this:
git log master...threadirqs
or replace master with $whatever. Ok, that's really what I wanted. It
would be nice if a branch could be setup without all the merge history
builtin - that's supposed to be in the rt-master and so forth
branches...but whatever.
