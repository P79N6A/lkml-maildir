Oops, sorry, you did say "in the includes".  Yeah, that holds the same
crap that I'm talking about. 
$ cat include/asm-i386/stacktrace.h
#include <asm-x86_64/stacktrace.h>
Which isn't something that I would like to stay either. So it's just
something else that needs to be fixed. Not something that will
circumvent what the current patch set is trying to do.
