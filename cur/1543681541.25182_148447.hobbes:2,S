Sorry, any vendor contemplating shipping 2.6test in a device at this stage
is a lunatic.  I don't care about lunatics.  As we saw recently there
are a lot of wireless routers and the like out there all stuck on some
magical 2.4.5 kernel. That sucks, but it's at least better than putting
beta quality code in something people pay money for.
