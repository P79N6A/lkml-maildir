I agree, but note that there is one hidden problem:
There can be one notification for each registered message queue. If 
there are more than ~560 queues and one process wants to install 
SIGEV_THREAD notification handlers for all of them, then the netfilter 
code will run against the socket rmem limit and mq_notify will block.
_If_ there are users that do that we'll have to bypass the normal 
sk_rmem_alloc and add an mqueue specific limit.
