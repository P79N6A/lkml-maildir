Subject: [PATCH 0/4] firewire: order of memory accesses (bus generation vs. node ID)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I now updated some patches from November according to comments I
received from Nick back then.  As Jarod found out now while testing the
November versions, parts of these patches actually fix multiply reported
bugs.
While updating this stuff, I also found two more read sites where the
read order was not properly enforced.
Incoming:
1/4 firewire: fw-sbp2: use device generation, not card generation
2/4 firewire: fw-cdev: use device generation, not card generation
3/4 firewire: enforce access order between generation and node ID
4/4 firewire: fw-core: react on bus resets while the config ROM is being fetched
