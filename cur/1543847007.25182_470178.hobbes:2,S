With the bad Intel reference BIOS that's far too many.
I've considered using PCI-IDs but even with that it would be quite messy.

AFAIK that's always the case right now. Jeff's secret NDA device
is the only known exception so far.

Actually they don't hang at discovery, but at the verify step we early use
to decide if mcfg works or not (we go through a few busses and compare
type 1 and mcfg). This is currently separate from the normal discovery
to not burden the generic code with it.
To be fair one issue is that the verify step current ignores the ACPI
information about how many busses there are, but iirc the Intel board hung 
pretty early so it likely wouldn't have helped there anyways.
At some point there was hope if checking the MCFG against other
ACPI resources would catch it, but it didn't at least on the board
I tested on.

Yes that would be a good change.
