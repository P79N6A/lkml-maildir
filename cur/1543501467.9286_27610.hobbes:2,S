Dear Colleagues,
I am about to implement an experimental scheduler for Linux. In this
project I would like to use individual time slices for each task. I
found out that the property 'counter' of task_struct keeps track to the
remainder of every slice. But although it should just strike me, I feel
just blind looking over the code where the property is set. Or is it
really just set through priority?
Could You please help me out?
TIA,
Ralf
