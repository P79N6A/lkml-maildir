Hm, that would require dynamic allocation of the memory,
probably not an issue, but the masks would also need to be
dynamic.  The question is is it worth it.  The 512 entry
list seems to handle a very large number of timers with no
trouble.  We did tests measuring timer arm times with 4000
timers in the list.  The slope was so low that we did not
even try to increase the list size.
