Exactly.  This is not a minor behavior change that can be isolated to
a few drivers.  It's a fundamental change in behavior that is widespread
(I mentioned serial drivers specifically as that's what I was concerned
with but you are correct that it affects everything that uses the tty layer).
It's probably a good change to make at some point in the future, but it
needs to happen in a well defined and clearly identifiable way.  It would
probably be best for it to happen in the 2.5 tree.

Yes.  Redhat's default kernel in 7.1 (2.4.2-2 as it identifies itself)
will not call the close() routines if the open() routines return an
error.  The real problem isn't that the behavior changed, but that there's
no easy way to tell that they had changed it.
