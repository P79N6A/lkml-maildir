Hi,
Here are some more USB fixes for 2.6.0-test4.  They include a fix for
the uhci driver that a lot of people have been running into for a while.
Also included is a fix for the pl2303 driver for B0 and for when you
connect to the device after closing it.
Also included is gadgetfs which allows access to usb gadget devices from
userspace without any ioctls needed :)
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/linus-2.6
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
