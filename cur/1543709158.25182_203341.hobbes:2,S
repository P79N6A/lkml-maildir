hi marcelo-
this patch seems to address the extra read at the end of files or devices
that end exactly on a page boundary, while retaining the good readahead
characteristics of my original patch.  i'd like to hear about any testing
from folks who have one of:
  mpt fusion
  ips (ibm serveraid)
  promise ata (and maybe sata too)
this patch is against 2.4.26-pre1.
