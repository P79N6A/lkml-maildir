From this I'll assume that
- CPU0 and CPU1 share a TSC and CPU2 and CPU3 share another TSC.
- write_tsc() simply doesn't work on this machine.
- Earlier kernels weren't able to modify the TSC either.
- Earlier kernels didn't use the TSC as a time source whereas this one
  does, hence the problems which you're observing.
Some or all of the below might be wrong, but I don't think so:
I assume that booting with clock=pit or clock=pmtmr fixes it?
It would be useful to check your 2.6.17 boot logs, see if we can work out
what 2.6.17 was using for a clock source.
We need to fix that "fixed it up" message because it just ain't so.
The new clocksouce code needs to detect this and to mark the TSC source as
unstable, or otherwise unusable.
We _could_ fix the TSC skew up, by adjusting the rdtsc output by the
tsc_values[] entry wherever we read the TSC.
It would of course be better to make write_tsc() work.  I wonder why it
doesn't?
