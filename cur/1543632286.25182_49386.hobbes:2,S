Yes, that's what caught my attention. Also floppies are the most
likely drives to produce errors. You might need a bit less "perfection"
in your rule-making to accommodate real-world problems. Many servers
have the root file-system mounted r/o with writable "throw-aways" mounted
on the usual mount-points like /tmp and /var.
