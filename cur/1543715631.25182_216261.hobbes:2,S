right now we have two broken drivers. They are only broken, because we
need a device for loading the firmware. If the PCMCIA driver model
integrations is not yet ready, we should find a way to make the firmware
loading possible without having a device. We don't need the device for
any other task. Actually I don't know how to achieve it, but I think if
we give a NULL pointer to the request_firmware() call the firmware_class
should create a dummy device.

Marcel
