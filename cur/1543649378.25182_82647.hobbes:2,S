And
  3) The current large page implementation is only for applications
     that want anonymous *non-pageable* shared memory.  Shared page
     tables reduce resource usage for any shared area that's mapped
     at a common address and is large enough to span entire pte pages.
     Since all pte pages are shared on a COW basis at fork time, children
     will continue to share all large read-only areas with their
     parent, eg large executables.
