Subject: Cause of SCT vm being faster than Linus's new VM?

	Is it known what is making Linus VM 30% slower than SCT's vm?  I wonder
how much difference the changes to /proc/sys/vm/{freepages,buffermem}
made.  That seems like a no-brainer to merge to Linus...
	I'll try some kernel-compilation experiments here with 8 M later today.
