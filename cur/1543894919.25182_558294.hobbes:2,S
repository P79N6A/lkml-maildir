It isn't redundant at all. I specifies the definitions of several terms used 
in the GPLv2 and also defines the exact scope of the license. If you feel 
that the definition of the terms and the limitation of scope were redundant 
then you are sadly mistaken.

For a license to be legally enforceable it must be internally consistent. 
Without that internal consistency it becomes very easy to circumvent it. The 
GPLv2's definitions and defined scope - as per section 0 - define the limits 
of the license and are entirely consistent with the rest of it. What it 
*isn't* consistent with is the FSF's other "propaganda" and the wants of the 
FSF to make certain activities verboten in GPLv3.

And that is their right. However, it appears to a nearly unanimous consensus 
that it is the truth. It may not be liked by some people, but likes and 
dislikes don't matter.

Yep. I've done it to you on more than one occasion, Alexandre. The part that 
makes me laugh is that you still haven't realized it.
