i just found a new category of driver regressions in 2.6.21, doing 
allyesconfig bzImage bootup tests: the init methods of various drivers 
hangs in driver_unregister().
It is caused by this problem: the semantics of driver_unregister() [also 
implicitly called in pci_driver_unregister()] has apparently changed 
recently. If a driver does:
	pci_register_driver(&my_driver);
	...
	if (some_failure) {
		pci_unregister_driver(&my_driver);
		...
	}
it will hang the bootup in the following piece of code:
 drivers/base/driver.c:
  void driver_unregister(struct device_driver * drv)
  {
         bus_remove_driver(drv);
         wait_for_completion(&drv->unloaded);
the completion is never done - because nobody removes the bus while the 
init is still happening, obviously. (and bootup is serialized anyway)
now, the majority of drivers does the driver unregistry from its 
module-cleanup function, so it's not affected by this problem. But if 
you apply the debug patch attached further below, and do an allyesconfig 
bzImage bootup, there's 3 hits already:

possibly more could trigger. Each of these 3 places caused an actual 
bootup hang on my testbox, so these are real regressions and need to be 
fixed.
because there are a good number of drivers that do 
pci_unregister_device() from their init function, and because i cannot 
see anything obviously wrong in doing an unregister call after a 
failure, i think it's driver_unregister() that needs to be fixed. Greg, 
what do you think?
