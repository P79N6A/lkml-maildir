Bart,
please file bugs in RH bugzilla for Fedora issues. Fedora is shipping
drivers that aren't upstream, and I'm attempting to resolve the issues
as they arise. However not having a bug to track stuff in means it just
goes far enough out of my inbox that I forget about it.
The revert isn't a fix for -ati, and I haven't seen any reports of
performance problems with profiles attached in my bugzilla.
I'm booting drm-next on more various radeon hw today to see what I can
reproduce, most of the kms changes for 2.6.29 are nothing to do with
radeon at all, we are only upstreaming KMS for Intel hw, so I'm not sure
what the sceptical bit is about. Its much more likely this is
multi-master changes before KMS that are interacting badly.
Dave.
