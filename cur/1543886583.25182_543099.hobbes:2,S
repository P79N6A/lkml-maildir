It certainly seems useful when debugging hotplug issues or random SATA 
problems which end up being caused by communication problems. Without 
this output, Joe User stands no chance of figuring out what's going on, 
and neither does Joe libata Developer unless they really care to dig 
through the spec and count bits to figure out what they mean. At least 
with this you can see that there was a CRC error, etc. and go from that..
