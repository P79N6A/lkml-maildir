Me too.
I had to read through the code several times, and then find the patch
that introduced the bug and make sure it looked wrong too, which it
does.
The only time that the dentry is used after the dput that reduces
d_count to 0, is that dput is called once more, and it is very soon
and only decrements the count (down to -1).
So there is a very small window for someone else to get that piece of
memory and have it corrupted.
This bug was first brought to my attention by the NFSv4 team who have
obviously been hammering nfsd harder than the rest of us (an in more
interesting ways, as is the nature of nfsv4).
