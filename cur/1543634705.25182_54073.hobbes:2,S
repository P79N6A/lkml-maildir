Hi,
same for me. AFAICS when looking into the diff which got into -pre10 the
only change around the place where the lost interrupt is detected is a
dropped spin_lock_irq() around a 1sec mdelay() while probing the
interrupt. The interesting observation however is with 2.5.24 which has
exactly the same code as 2.4.19-pre10 and - surprise - does work for me
just fine. So I don't have a good idea what might cause the problem with
2.4.19-pre10...
