Right, you need atleast a X number of notes to make it a copyrighted piece,
doesn't have to be a whole song, tho. If someone snags 10-20 secs of a song,
and puts it into his/her song that's violation of the copyrights (given
that the person didn't ask for permission). But, then there's "what's the
minimum"-question, and with code that's hard, and you would probably need
a lawyer and a few settlements in the court-systems, if not even more,
to get an agreement on this.
