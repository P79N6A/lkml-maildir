Tried this patch and it applied fine.
The target is a laptop though and I find that this patch will somehow generate
lots of diskaccesses and thus the disk will never "sleep".
Checking out what the reason might be it seems like it is the preempt stuff 
that
writes notes about processes been kicked ouf to /var/log/messages.
Is there a way to shut this off ?
BRGDS and  thanks for the unified patch
