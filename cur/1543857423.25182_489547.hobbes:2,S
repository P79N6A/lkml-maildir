Your or I missed a bug fix/enhancement in there somewhere.
Basically my very early setup of the fixmap failed.
Now.  I thought I had that covered by preallocated the pud and the pmd
entries.   So the only thing missing was the pte entries.
If that is not a big enough hint I will look into it in a bit...
I'm starting to become a big fan of constant initializers.  So our
core subsystems don't need initialization code to be useful.  All of
these early things are just a pain.
