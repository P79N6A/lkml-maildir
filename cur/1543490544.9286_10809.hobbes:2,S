But the code seems to plug the major, thus the controller, but says that
it plugs the device. This perhaps didn't affected performances with early
controllers. Now, it is allowed to have queues based on kdev_t value, but
the code still seems to plug the major. This looks too me like some
incomplete enhancement, btw.

Hmmm ... Not that simple. The queuing model that must be used depends on
the low-level sub-system being involved. You may have some hierarchy with
limits for queuing and you donnot want to hang-up or to do bad things. Too
much links or mappings in the blkdevs will make things way complex, in my
opinion. The only thing we should want to do from ll_rw_blk.c is to plug
the right things we want to sort requests and coalesce IOs for, in my
opinion.

It is how the code seems to have evolved.

May-be not so well, but nothing is perfect. :)
