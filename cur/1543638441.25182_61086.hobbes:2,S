It's part of the main kernel tree.  Please read the Linux USB Guide at
http://www.linux-usb.org/
 for how to set up USB drivers and your system
on Linux.
I also suggest if you have any followup questions after reading the
guide, to read the FAQ and provide all of the information needed there
to the linux-usb-users mailing list.
Good luck,
greg k-h
