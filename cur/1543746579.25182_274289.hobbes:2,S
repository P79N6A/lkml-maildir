My message was mainly about XML, for which it is easy.
For non-XML, you need some other way of knowing the file format. The
example that originally came up in this thread was
/etc/passwd/[username]
In this case, the passwd file has a known format.
Other file types, like LaTex, html, jpeg also have (at least partially)
known formats. Some selection should be possible even for unknown
formats (e.g. byte range, line-range). There could also be some way of
specifying a new format but I don't know how to do this well. You could
give names (like filenames) to parts of files.
But I think the first step would be to concentrate on XML, and worry
about the rest later.   Peter
