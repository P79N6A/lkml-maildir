Maybe be because you actually typed "disabled" in your previous
message ? :)

Well, we do need to harvest descriptors of course, though I suppose that
can be done in hard_xmit as well. I'm not sure if there is any real

That is the most important point imho for the specific case of spidernet
on cell.
