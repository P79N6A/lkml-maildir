I doubt it does; rhel isn't that much patches...

... however it's very much designed only for the kernel that comes with
it (with "it's" I mean all the userspace infrastructure); all the
changes and additions since 2.6.9 aren't incorporated so you probably
really want new alsa, new initscripts, new mkinitrd, new
module-init-tools. some because of abi changes since 2.6.9, others
because the kernel grew capabilities that are really needed for "nice"
behavior.
