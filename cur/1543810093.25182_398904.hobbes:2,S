That's _really_ odd, as hal, udev and dbus all work just fine on my
machines with the above changeset (actually with 2.6.16-rc4).  And that
changeset should not have caused anything to change with regards to the
core uevent code, as it's a usb-serial change only.
And you don't even have CONFIG_USB_SERIAL enabled...  Very odd.
If you revert this one patch, on top of a clean 2.6.16-rc4, do things
start working for you again?
