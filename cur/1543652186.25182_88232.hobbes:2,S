Hi,
in 2.5.46 my pointer jumps around on screen and these messages appears in
kernel log:
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away.
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
I'm accessing the mouse through /dev/psaux. The "mouse" is the trackpoint
on an ibm thinkpad x24.
