what are

Ok. Short summary (on mxser, moxa is different):                      
- multiple board support is broken                                    
- driver blows up on illegal device minor numbers opened              
- no security checks whatsoever on internal array overflows           
- Completely broken port-number setup                                 
- No visible NULL-pointer checks regarding dynamic structures         
It looks like original taiwanese work: it is usable, but there are so 
many dead ends in this code, you won't believe - and I did only look  
some few minutes on it.                                               
It desperately needs cleanup.                                         
Listen Tim, if you want to do it, I can help you. But keep in mind, I 
have no hardware. So I am probably not the right guy for maintenance. 
If you do not feel comfortable, I will try it.
