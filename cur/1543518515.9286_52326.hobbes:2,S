I'll tell you what they're hiding (or it seems to me so)
Here on my NT machine I got stuck with this chip.
What I really like in this chip is that it can mix automatically some
output and mix them. So while I listen to mp3's all day at work, it can
also play the email notify on Netscape, my ICQ beeps with messages and
other sounds.
At home with my NT and AWE-64 (Value) it seems it cannot do that :(
However, this chip (the DS-XG) SUCKS under vmware (both the Linux & NT
versions) when it tries to play sound from the Guest OS (either Linux or
Win NT/2000). I tried every configuration and also their LAB3 version.
