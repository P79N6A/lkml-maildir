There's something in -ac tree:
  x CONFIG_IKCONFIG:                                                        x  
  x                                                                         x  
  x This option enables the complete Linux kernel ".config" file            x  
  x contents, information on compiler used to build the kernel,             x  
  x kernel running when this kernel was built and kernel version            x  
  x from Makefile to be saved in kernel. It provides documentation          x  
  x of which kernel options are used in a running kernel or in an           x  
  x on-disk kernel.  This information can be extracted from the kernel      x  
  x image file with the script scripts/extract-ikconfig and used as         x  
  x input to rebuild the current kernel or to build another kernel.         x  
  x It can also be extracted from a running kernel by reading               x  
  x /proc/ikconfig/config and /proc/ikconfig/built_with, if enabled.        x  
  x /proc/ikconfig/config will list the configuration that was used         x  
  x to build the kernel and /proc/ikconfig/built_with will list             x  
  x information on the compiler and host machine that was used to           x  
  x build the kernel.                                                       x
