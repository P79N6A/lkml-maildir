Thanks for doing the split, great work.
For future reference, it would help if the subject line also had a short
description, something more like
	Subject: [PATCH 1/19] dm: move ioctl numbers to sane place
but that's just a small technical detail and I'll make up my own "short
description" based on your longer in-email ones.
