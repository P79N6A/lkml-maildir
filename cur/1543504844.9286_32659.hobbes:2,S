One thought would be to have a file that's loaded by the kernel as
part of its start-up, which contains the relevant settings as last
saved. Something like...
 1. Have each driver mark the relevant settings as "savable".
 2. Whenever one of the settings marked as "savable" is changed,
    modify the relevant file to contain the revised setting.
 3. If the SAVEFILE flag in the kernel's flag word is set, have
    the kernel load this file early in its start-up, and treat
    each line therein that was not already on the kernel's list
    of parameters as an additional kernel parameter to be added
    to its command line.
Note that at the moment, the kernel's flag word only has one bit
defined, which determines whether the root partition is mounted
read-only or read-write. Since it is defined as a 16-bit value, there
are 15 unused flags there, so there would be little problem adding an
extra flag in there.
The only restriction I can see to this method is that the relevant
disk subsystem would need to be initialised without benefit of this
file, to enable the kernel to locate the file in question.
Note also that I've said that the file would be updated as the
settings were changed. This is to minimise the effects of system
crashes, which could otherwise cause updates to get lost.

The above would automate it as much as is possible.
Best wishes from Riley.
