It's debug2fs, details to come.
The COMPAT_FEATURE thing is a problem, we *are* supposed to be able to fsck
a volume that has indexed directories on it with old versions of fsck, and 
it's only the COMPAT_FEATURE flag that prevents this.  You tried fsck -f 
and it didn't work, right?
For using the -o index option on a non-throwaway volume, we should do this:
 void ext2_add_compat_feature (struct super_block *sb, unsigned feature)
 {
+	return;
 	if (!EXT2_HAS_COMPAT_FEATURE(sb, feature))
 	{
And afterwards you can rm -rf your test directory, though actually normal 
ext2 shouldn't see anything unusual about it.  The real reason for rm'ing the 
test directory is so that I can tweak the index format in upcoming prerelease 
versions.
I've disabled the add_compat_feature here for now, because until fsck can 
handle it, it just causes trouble.  I'll go read Andreas' writeup on the 
COMPAT flags again and see if I can come up with a more friendly 
interpretation.
