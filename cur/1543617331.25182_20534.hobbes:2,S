The *starting* point to build a working solution. And stable != supported.
The "working solution" being a distro kernel (well, the whole thing really),
which happens to be supported (and supportable), too...

They *virtually* do. Why do they have (slightly) DIFFERENT hardware
compatibility lists? I don't care if they do really test a given HW
configuration as long as they support it.  You can't ask Marcelo to
actively support any HW conf. I'd expect him to "support" just the HW
he uses to build tarballs.

Uh? After autoconfiguration you *hope* the kernel boots. In late 2.2
times, vanilla 2.2 used to be almost useless for just less-than-naive
users. Think of RAID @ redhat, or ReiserFS @ suse.
BTW, if I buy a RH Linux CD set (+support), and install it on a PC made
by parts all included in RH HW compatibility list, I expect:
1) it to work;
2) failing 1), Red Hat to solve any problem when I call them for support;
3) failing 2), Red Hat to return the money for the CDs.
That's what vendors are for.

Are you suggesting that Joe User should run Debian/*unstable*? What
it Debian/stable for, then?

The user isn't expected to do any QA. And Marcelo and other kernel
maitainers aren't, either.

No problem for me. Feel free to answer me privately, as the above is 
hardly kernel-related (it applies to any other piece of software).
