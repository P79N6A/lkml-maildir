Since that was my patch, allow me to defend it a little...
One of the design goals was to eliminate the need for the user-space
update process.  It simply calls bdflush(1, 0) every five seconds,
which (in 2.2.7) would do almost the same thing as what kflushd does
when awakened by wakeup_bdflush.  There is no particular reason why
kflushd can't wake up every five seconds itself.  Does it make more
sense now?
Killing flushtime was an accident.  I erroneously thought the inner
loop in sync_old_buffers() and the inner loop in bdflush() were
identical.  [I swear I looked at them side-by-side and didn't see it!]
It is my personal opinion - and at least one other person concurs -
that there should be a hard limit on the length of time before any
dirty buffer is flushed back to disk.  flushtime is a rational way to
achieve that.  You casually brush off filesystem integrity (also
user data integrity; all writes go through the buffer cache) as
unimportant; that is a very strange priority to me.  
I've sent the appended patch to Linus already; it addresses what I
think are the bugs in the 2.2.8 bdflush.  I'd be interested to hear
what you think of it.
