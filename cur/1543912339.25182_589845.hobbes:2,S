Looks like this is just alpha and a certain particular compiler version? 
You may get away with adding
void __kmalloc_size_too_large(void)
{
	BUG();
}
somewhere if you use the particular compiler version causing trouble. 
The compiler will then generate some useless code wasting processor 
cycles due to not folding constants but it should(tm) work.
