Though if you look deeper into that, you find that PROT_GROWSDOWN and
PROT_GROWSUP are all about determining the start or end of the range
when it's the stack: nothing to do with the protection flags set.
Which inclines me the more against using mprotect to set VM_DONTCOPY.

My error.  See further down where the code is shown.

That newflags shift and mask is checking VM_READ,VM_WRITE,VM_EXEC against
VM_MAYREAD,VM_MAYWRITE,VM_MAYEXEC (the same bits shifted up/down 4).
It's checking, for example, whether the caller actually has permission
to mprotect the mapping to make writes to the file.
But I was reading it wrongly, sorry: I thought you were going to need a
VM_MAYDONTCOPY bit in order to give permission for you to mprotect the
mapping to VM_DONTCOPY.  No, it's only checking the bottom four bits
(including VM_SHARED against VM_MAYSHARE, but that's never changed).

But it doesn't matter if the process does fork after mmap before madvise.
It only starts to matter when you do get_user_pages (for writing): that
will break COW on the private pages made readonly by a preceding fork,
your problem is when a fork occurs after that to make them readonly.

PROT_DONTCOPY seems quite enough to signal the extension,
if we were to go the mprotect route.

Interesting.
But (correct me if I'm wrong, I know nothing about InfiniBand userspace
initiators) that would be done by a driver, which can set VM_DONTCOPY
on the vma, without us having to extend the mprotect or madvise API

I think the usual case is simply that userspace does not touch those
pages while they are pinned by get_user_pages, and/or it does not fork.
But we have occasionally got bitten by the issue.

Quite possibly: I only thought it through far enough to conclude that
your proposal has the great merit of simplicity in comparison,
despite its dubious interface.

Please correct that to weeks ;)

madvise has been splitting vmas forever, and was enhanced to remerge
them 2.6.13-rc.

Has to add a flag to mmap?  I didn't buy your "atomic" argument above,
did I miss something?
I still prefer madvise to mprotect for this, but admit neither is
entirely clean, would rather let someone else decide between them.
Even more I'd prefer one of these two solutions below, which sidestep
that uncleanliness - but both of these would be in mmap only, no clean
way to change afterwards (except by munmap or mmap MAP_FIXED):
1.  Use the standard mmap(NULL, len, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
    MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) which gives you a memory object
    shared with children, so write-protection and COW won't come into it.
or if there's good reason why that's no good,
2.  Define a MAP_DONTCOPY to mmap: we have a fine tradition of MAP_flags
    to achieve this or that effect, adding one more would be cleaner than
    now corrupting mprotect or madvise.

(I don't understand why you propose a new flag for the usual behaviour,
but that's just a matter of which way round it's defined, not important.)
Splitting a vma from within get_user_pages is not straightforward,
we need down_write(&mm->mmap_sem) for a start; I think we'd all prefer
to avoid that if we can - as I said, your proposal rather simpler.
Coincidentally, Linus has drawn my attention in the last week to some
uses of get_user_pages which are behaving in a way which I believe
is currently mishandled, and may need splitting the vma.  But I don't
think you should wait around for however we decide to fix that issue.
