Yes. I am working on that. But, I don't yet have a system to 
test that.

That CONFIG is required. Cpu_has_pae and cpu_has_nx doesn't 
imply that we are using nx. Only when PAE kernel is configured 
and these features are available, we use it.
Looking at the code again, I can remove that CONFIG_X86_PAE,
if I use an additional check for nx_enabled.

Yes. I saw that eax was not used. But, I thought it is clean to save 
and restore every register that is being touched here. Just in case some
other code around these place starts using those registers in future.
If you think that is unnecessary, I will resend the patch with minimal 
push/pops.

It seems necessary for swapper_pg_dir too as we use nx even for kernel
pages (stack, module, etc).
Thanks,
