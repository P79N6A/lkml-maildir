Bad block, and sufficiently bad that it couldn't then recover the block
and rewrite it. When a drive sees a marginal read (lot of forward error
correction recovery needed) it will try and rewrite or move the block.
In this case it couldn't read the block enough to move it.

Sounds like it dropped to PIO - that may be a bug triggered by the drive
failing.
