  This worked wonderfully, and I thank the several people who suggested that
I could just use "ld -r" to do this. Why isn't libgcc1.a linked into the
kernel somewhere when compiling with GCC already? Or are the symbols not
exported perhaps?

  Thanks, I appreciate this. I was about to do it, but my answer is all I
need to print.
