Ingo, can you create a test-case to verify that a new-style thread can
sanely do
	if (!vfork())
		execve();
	thread_exit();
which leaves the other threads alive and well and is reasonably 
efficient..
I don't personally much like the POSIX execve() behaviour, and I'd like to 
make sure that it can be avoided for cases where that makes sense (ie a 
threaded app that wants to start some other helper program should be able 
to do so).
