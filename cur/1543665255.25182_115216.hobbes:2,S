Hi,
 I got some problems with USB (in my case the mouse).
 If I enable "APIC" in the BIOS of the motherboard,
 usb failed to "accept" my USB device.
 It constantly prints on the console (and log file):
 Mar  7 08:14:33 solfire kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
 Mar  7 08:14:33 solfire kernel: usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=4 (error=-110)
 Mar  7 08:14:39 solfire kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
 Mar  7 08:14:39 solfire kernel: usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=5 (error=-110)
 Mar  7 08:14:44 solfire kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
 Mar  7 08:14:44 solfire kernel: usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=6 (error=-110)
 the address is constantly increased...printing does not stop, I hat
 to rmmod uhci for that.
 The mouse was not recognized.
 The failure seems to arise before  the mouse is recognized as such.
 I cannot decide, whether it is a problem of the motherboard or a
 linux kernel thingy...
 My system:
 Linux 2.4.21rc5
 EPoX 8K5A3+ (VIA KT333) motherboard
 Athlon XP 2400+
 DDR RAM 256 MB (Samsung)
 USB Mouse
 USB Cardreader
 I have enabled in the linux config:
 CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
 CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
 CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
 CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
 CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
 CONFIG_APM=m
 CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
 CONFIG_USB=m
 CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y
 CONFIG_USB_UHCI=m
 CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT=m
 CONFIG_USB_OHCI=m
 CONFIG_USB_STORAGE=m
 CONFIG_USB_HID=m
 CONFIG_USB_KBD=m
 CONFIG_USB_MOUSE=m
 What did I wrong ?
 Any help would be very appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.
 Kind regards,
 Meino Cramer
