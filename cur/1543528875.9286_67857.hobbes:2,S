Well, this looks like a lightly loaded modem connection. Could you
please make sure the modem isn't used for anything but the ping
and ping the opposite point of the link only?
Btw, there were no important changes between 2.3.40 and 2.3.49 in acm.c
that could be causing this (except to the wakeup stuff now, which could
delay data by up to 10 ms).
