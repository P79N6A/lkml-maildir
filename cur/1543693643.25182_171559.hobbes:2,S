Sadly, yes. My most recent and most comprehensive tests (today) were with 
the -test7 kernel. Could you give me some details as to what the fix is 
supposed to do and why it may not work?
Also, I'd still be interested to know - what is "events/0"? And why do 
things run like a 286 when I enable HIGHMEM?
I eye some hope here. Must say a life without linux is pretty empty 
(especially after my girlfriend left... you gotta reach for something; and 
a new guitar is a little off budget still). :-)
