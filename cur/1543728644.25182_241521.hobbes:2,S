Another possible reason for removing the warnings (which I encountered
while trying out the latest xcdroast today): any output to stderr during
the burn is flagged by the wrapper as an error, which violates the
principle of least astonishment from a user perspective.  In other words,
no distinction is made between warnings and errors before announcing an
error has occurred.
Understanding this, it's easy enough to scan the expanded output and see
what really happened.  FWIW, I don't think removing the warnings to avoid
this issue is the correct solution.
