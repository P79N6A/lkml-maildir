Final observation: After patching in the changes from mm kernels for
multiple agp bridges to the drm-source code (the patch
drm-add-support-for-new-multiple-agp-bridge-agpgart-api.patch from the
broken out archive) I could compile the drm-trunk-src modules.
So now I am running with 2.6.11-rc3-mm2 + Xorg + DRI enabled (and
working) with the drm modules from drm-trunk-module-src.
Outcome: freeze when switching to X. As with the other modules (in fact
I think that most of the changes to the drm stuff are included in the mm
kernel, so this should not change anything, as mm pulls from bk-agpgart,
bk-drm-via) a funny screen, and the CapsLock light is blinking.
