That matches the style used in the rest of the file.

Ok.

It is, isn't it? The name's somewhat misleading, but I was just using 
what already existed...

Sure.

If that's considered reasonable, sure.

The backlight interface only supports exporting and setting the current 
brightness. For various bits of hardware, the AC and DC brightnesses are 
stored separately. Drivers would need to know which brightness value to 
export to userspace. I have an HP backlight driver here which would 
benefit from this, and I'm looking at the same issue for a Panasonic 
one.
Here's an updated version, anyway.
