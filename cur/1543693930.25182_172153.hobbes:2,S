Please don't.   Remap_file_pages() not 100% working the way
a normal mmap() works should be a case of "doctor, it hurts".
Making the VM more complex just to support the (allegedly
low overhead) hack of remap_file_pages() doesn't seem like
a worthwhile tradeoff to me.
In fact, I wouldn't mind if remap_file_pages() was simplified ;)
