I had this argument over whether normal people would ever really need a 
10mb hard drive when I was 21.  Once was enough, sorry, I didn't 
convince the other guy then, and I don't think I have gotten more 
eloquent since then.
I'll just say that entertainment will drive computing for the next 5-15 
years, and game designers won't have enough CPU that whole time.  
Hollywood is dying like radio did, and immersive experiences are 
replacing it.
HDTV might not make it.  I personally don't really want any audio or 
video devices or sources which are not well integrated into my computer, 
and HDTV is not.  I am not sure if the rest of the market will think 
like me, but the gamers  might....  I am getting a La Cie 4 monitor next 
week which will do 2048x1536 without blurring pixels for $960, and I 
just don't think I will want to use an HDTV for anything except maybe 
the kitchen.  I try to watch a high quality movie once a week with a 
friend because I don't want to miss out on our culture (and games are 
not yet as culturally rich as movies), but games are more engaging, and 
I am not really managing to watch the movie a week.  I seem to be at the 
extreme of a growing trend.

You didn't say whether you typically haul stuff and kids over rough 
roads.  If you don't (and very few SUV owners do), then what you need is 
called a "mini-van", which is what people who are functionally oriented 
buy for city hauling of kids and stuff ;-), and I bought my wife one.  
It has more than 16 CPUs in it....
