Hello All,
    I am having a problem with test6-pre1 and test6-pre2.  When I boot these
kernels the machine locks up during the executions of the RC scripts
before the machine gets into multiuser mode.  I booted each kernel 1
time, and they failed in different RC scripts (linuxconf and keysyms).
Nothing interesting was in the logs.  I can do more tests to see how
repeatable this is if it would be helpful.  The test5 kernel works w/o
problem, so I assume its something introduced in test6-pre1.
    I dont know exactly what information would be helpful.  This machine has
an AMD-K6 3D processor, 128 M of ram, NE2K-PCI and a Tulip ethernet cards.
No SCSI.  Its a Red Hat 6.2 system, and I rebuilt the kernel with the gcc
that comes with that distribution.  If I left out something important,
let me know.
Thanks,
Jim
