Yes, in effect I think I'm saying unit testing is easier against a stable 
backdrop.
I'm not offering to implement anything, correct.  The code in question's been 
implemented.  I leave wheel reinvention to others.

This really doesn't follow.  Not all modifications are global in their impact, 
and therefore many patches could coexist simultaneously without interference.
Additionally, if the kernel version control tools extended beyond majordomo, 
sendmail and an editor, it would even be conceivable for people to check out 
those branches they decided were suitable for their application.

Or you regenerate it for the next 2.even, as this may be less effort.

What's acceptable is purely subjective.  Another good reason for a 
post-distribution distribution.  Many of us do it anyway, for significant and 
useful functionality which hasn't found its way through the `input filtering'.

That's not what's being suggested.  The question posed was more like: why are 
authors expected to operate with no feedback in generating new patches.

Forget it.  There's a point beyond which it's not worth arguing, but easier to 
get off and do it.

If you took the time to read the posts in this thread, you'd see that the 
patch has apparently been `offered up to Linus' on several occasions, without 
what was apparently effective feedback.
At the moment it seems to me that people just abandon the process in despair.  
If nothing else, my part in this conversation is to suggest that a 
non-despairing alternative might be needed, possible, and even feasible.

Of course the process is opaque, in parts.  Its opacity has nothing to do with its complexity, but with some subjective and non-transparent aspects of the process.
I'll give you an example:  GGI.  Nobody seems to know quite what happened to it.  Not even people arguing on your side can articulate the reasons clearly.  That's reasonable evidence of non-transparency.
The author of the piece of code I am interested in has no idea why the code didn't get incorporated.  That's not a transparent process.  If, in fact, it's because the patches were against 2.even, then a simple email to that effect may have saved him time, and may have given us useful functionality.
I asked a simple question in my initial post: `Is there a good reason, or indeed any reason, why epckpt isn't in the kernel right now?'
I still haven't got a clear answer to it.  I don't know, you don't know, Alan Cox doesn't say (who knows if he knows, or ever knew) ... nobody knows.  It's not a transparent process.
At least we can be clear about *that*.
Colin.
