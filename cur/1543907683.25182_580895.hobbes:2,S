Glauber started the paravirt ops 64 a second time around, from scratch
using the PVOPS of i386 as a base. But since we couldn't just take a the
PVOPS patch from i386 and apply it to x86_64, this was mainly done by
looking at i386 code and massaging it for x86_64. Somethings may have
slipped (and we may have been looking at different versions of PVOPS).
It's not easy trying to keep up with a moving target ;-)
