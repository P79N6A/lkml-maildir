this doesn't even sounds safe. If it's just for printing not a big deal,
but there may be functional usages where they should not truncate the
high 32bit of the 64bit words.
Bernardo, you should definitely add an #if BITS_PER_LONG == 64 around
your implementation of do_div in asm-generic, just to make an example
sparc is still silenty broken (and that's not an embedded thing).
In the #else path of the generic implementation you can consider adding
another version that casts to (long long), then as worse it will spwan a
link compile time failure. But if it compiles it won't generate runtime
failures. so basically it's up to gcc to do the right thing then.
