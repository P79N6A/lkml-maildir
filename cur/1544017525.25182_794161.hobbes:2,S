Yes, at the cost of removing a hidden relocation in head_64.S.  We can
also remove #ifdef there and just comment that it will be overridden
during setup_per_cpu_areas() but I think #ifdef there is better for
documentation purposes.

I like the goal but it has certain dangers in the current form because
the boot cpu is using the init data area not its actual percpu area,
so each usage needs to be closely controlled till actual per cpu areas
are setup, so I think in the current form I don't think there's a good
reason to hurry initialization of variables which are not used early.
It also in a way fragments initialization paths further.  It would be
nice if boot cpu and secondary cpus can do it using the same path at
different times.

I didn't have any objection against it but with the additional
relocation removed, it looked out of place in the patch.  Please feel
free to add it back as necessary.
Thanks.
