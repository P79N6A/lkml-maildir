Hey guys,
I am trying to write a client server application
wherein all the messages between the client and server
are encrypted. 
Just to get this whole things started lets say that I
established a shared secret between the communicating
entities. 
What is the best way to make this work. By this I mean
what is the best crypto API that I can use. I think
just for this purpose Openssl is overkill don't you
think. What kind of crypto API's can I incorporate
into my program to encrypt the message which is then
sent to the server. 
Thanks,
Vinay
