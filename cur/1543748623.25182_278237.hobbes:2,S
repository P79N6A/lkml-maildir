Any suggestions to determining the version of the installed udev?
This is now during startup, to see if we can make use of using
udevsend as hotplug agent.  If the system was up, udevinfo could
be used, but that is in /usr/bin that might be on a seperate /usr.
I know we might move udevinfo to /bin, but that might be an issue
for some, and adding a -V switch to /sbin/udev might be a better
choice if you do not have have any nit's against it ....
