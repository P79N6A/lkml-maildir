 I just got a report from `sxid'[1] showing some files with wierd
 modes that have uid/gid settings for users and groups that do not
 exist on this laptop.  When I went to investigate, I found that I
 could not remove those files, and discovered that they are device
 nodes.
 I brought it down to runlevel 1, remounted the filesystem read only,
 and ran `fsck -f'.  It corrected a bunch of errors (I should have
 made a typescript, but didn't think of that until just now.), all
 having to do with the corrupted files:
b--s--S-wx   1 24933    26988    107, 116 Jan 19  1970 /usr/src/cmucl-2.4.8/src/tools/CVS/Entries
br-s-w-rwx   1 25710    27476     46, 107 Jan  4  1970 /usr/src/cmucl-2.4.8/src/tools/build-and-install
b--xr-SrwT   1 25971    28271    103,  46 Jan 18  1970 /usr/src/cmucl-2.4.8/src/tools/clmcom.lisp
 ... which cannot be removed.  I tried to `lsattr' them, and it says
 it cannot find the modules for those devices.  I ran a find command
 and verified that those are the only device nodes outside of /dev.  I 
 don't know how to check /dev/ for oddball nodes that don't belong
 there or are camoflaged hack devices or what could they be.
 This is the second time something like this has happened to me on
 this same laptop...  another time it was some data files in
 /var/lib/dpkg/info.  I think it was with a 2.2.x kernel then also.
 I'm running:
Linux journeyhawk 2.2.7 #4 SMP Sat May 8 14:19:14 PDT 1999 i586 unknown
 ... which really ought not be compiled with SMP; it's a single
 processor laptop.  (Could that cause this?)
 I will preserve the machine in its present state in case anyone wants 
 me to investigate anything.  I can send the kernel config, etc.  I'll 
 try and only use it for a reader, and will network it only long
 enough for the sendmail to unqueue this email.
 One question is: Could someone have gained root, created device
 files, and inserted a kernel module to do something?  Is that way too
 paranoid, or what?  That question is why I mailed this to the Debian
 security team.  I found a thing once on the net called "heroin.c"
 that is a kernel module which allows you to hide directories and
 processes...  Perhaps some of you have seen it.  I worry that someone 
 could get in and do nasty things to my machine, or to package builds, 
 the compiler, steal my pgp key, or whatever else I'd never think of
 in time to win the chess game.  I worry that something I upload could 
 spread through the Debian mirrors this way, without me even knowing
 about it until too late, if ever.
 I don't know how long the files have been there; I just installed
 `sxid' the other day; this is the first report from it I've read, and 
 that's how I noticed the problem this time.  The other time, it was
 `dpkg' blonking on the bad files in its database.
 Another question is:  Are there "known" filesystem corruption
 problems with this version of the kernel?  (Do they only happen when
 loadable modules are enabled and on computers connected to the net?)
 Could someone get in, patch something, build, unpatch, log out?  OR
 patch a binary?  Can the compiler itself be corrupted in this
 fashion?  How can we check this machine for viruses?  Maybe I've been 
 foofed.  Or spyed on?
 If somebody got a .pgp/ directory, could they use that to sign email
 pretending to be someone else?  What if they somehow read your mind
 and got the passphrase?  Way paranoid... I need a "smartcard" or OTP
 calculator thing for the palm pilot so I don't have to think about my
 password.  (Every woman I've ever known can read my mind.)
 I don't know what else to tell yous.  Tell me what yous need to know.
 Maybe I should just drop out of the Linux thing and go back to
 cooking.  That's how I feel today.  Back to Norvig... <sigh>

Description: suid, sgid file and directory checking
 This program is runs as a cronjob. Basically it tracks any changes in
 your s[ug]id files and folders. If there are any new ones, ones that
 aren't set any more, or they have changed bits or other modes then it
 reports the changes. You can also run this manually for spot checking.
 .
 It tracks s[ug]id files by md5 checksums. This helps detect if your files
 have been tampered with, would not show under normal name and permissions
 checking. Directories are tracked by inodes.
