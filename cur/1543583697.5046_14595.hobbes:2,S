I mentioned bridging before - I don't want some kind of transparent
bridge, really so what I would need is for the router to be contactable
in the same way as before and for regular traffic to pass normally but
with a special arrangement for certain broadcast traffic.
Is it possible to selectively bridge broadcast traffic in the way I have
described?
Normally of course I'd have the router either being a standard router or
a bridge but in this case some kind of hybrid arrangement would be
preferable.
Thanks for your help,
