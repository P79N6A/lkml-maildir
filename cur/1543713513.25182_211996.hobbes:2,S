I'll give it a try with 2.6 this week.

um, yes. but the target "common_defconfig" was disabled somewhere in
2.5, so my shini script broke. i wanted to do common_defconfig first,
then always keep my .config and do "oldconfig" after patching, but
somehow my script broke, so i went with "allnoconfig"...but ok, i'll try
again.
if anyone is interested:

all the logfiles produced when patchin/compiling 2.5.21 up to 2.5.75.
right here the latest 2.4-benh and 2.6-benh kernels (via rsync), also
compiled via crosscompile:
