I saw my previous one line fix for fast clock problems under 32 bits, 
included in 2.4 kernel, 
but not on 2.6 yet. Please apply the following patch.
This patch will avoid clock running too fast on many ATI IXP and nforce boards.
Firstly, motherboard and bios should give the right irq pin info, but if it fails
It should be tweaked inside kernel by chipset id and etc, but if it fails,
my patch will works as a general purpose fail safe.
Under amd 64 bits, many people have been already working on tweaking 
irq pins detection and seems to be ok on most motherboard now, 
but not so many people working on 32 bits or 2.4 kernel.
I have ATI IXP chipset with Pentium M CPU, so the fast clock problem is not 
AMD64 specific.
It is not a optimal solution to use i8259A IRQ, but better than not working right.
