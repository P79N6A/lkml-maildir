No comma.  Change packet to message?

Huh?  That simple sentence confuses me.  Should "source" really be
"sink" or "destination"?  Or maybe say "IRQs at an interrupt controller
can be shared."  Or is that too hardware-specific?
Anyway, what source is meant here?  It doesn't mean that IRQs
at the producer device can be shared, right?  It's more at the
consumer device where they can be shared.
