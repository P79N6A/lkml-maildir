According to my assumption that lru list membership is (should be) worth one 
page count, if testzero triggers here the page is not on the lru.

It can't.  You know that because you found the page on the lru, its count
must be at least one (again, according to assumption above).

I'd like to jump in and chase more solutions with you, but the above doesn't 
prove your point, so I'm not ready to reject this one yet.
