   Who is expected to generate the modules.conf.auto file?

   It requires _global_ table comparison code which will simplify PCI probing
in most drivers (see also the recent PCI helper by Donald Becker for an
example of how this can be done).
   Also, external mapping from PCI codes to module is a good idea, but it should
be generated automatically from the drivers themselves since to avoid having
to modify it each time you change your kernel.

   It wouldn't work well since you would need to know how to obtain a file
descriptor for each driver and there are even drivers creating no such
descriptors (parport driver, USB low-level driver et cetera).
   Better make that an internal kernel call-back.

   How do you recognize built-in drivers?

   Do we really need that? I think that all hot-plug drivers should be able
to handle multiple devices without having to resort to such ugly tricks.
(Hmmm, it comes to my mind that we have to solve passing of options somehow...)
				Have a nice fortnight
