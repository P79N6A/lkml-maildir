Uninlining is good (I originally wanted to avoid controversy by not
having them compiled in unless they were called), but it's also possible
to remove the stack allocations entirely with more sophisticated
implementations. These are actually quite dumb as implementations of the
bitmap operations, and meant to look simple as opposed to performing well
or being well-behaved with respect to stackspace.
