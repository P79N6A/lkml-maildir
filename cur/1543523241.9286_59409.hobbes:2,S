There's no hard limit, other than a max of 31998 sub-directories per directory.
On the other hand, performance drops approx. O(n^2) as you add entries to the
directory, depending on your access patterns.  I wouldn't put more than 300-500
entries in a directory, but ~1000 may be OK for you.  More than that gets very
slow.
If you really want to have huge directories, you may want to look at reiserfs,
which uses btrees to index the directories.  People have been testing it with
millions of entries without too much performance degredation.
