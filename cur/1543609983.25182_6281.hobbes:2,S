	Hello,
	I have a dual Athlon w/ 512M RAM and three NICs (one gigabit
3c985B running 802.1Q with 5 VLANs, two on-board 100Mbit 3c982). This box
has almost nothing other to do apart from routing and packet filtering.
Is there anything I can do to tell the VM system to use as much memory
for network packets as possible?
	I haven't got time to measure the throughput at gigabit speeds
yet,  but I wonder if there is a way to tell the kernel "this box does
routing/firewalling, and almost nothing else".
