AFAICS, the CERN 2.4.18-27.7.x doesn't appear to have any NFS patches
in it beyond the standard 2.4.18 + the IRIX patch (i.e. it is
identical to the RedHat kernel as far as NFS is concerned).
As such it is missing a good deal of NFS client bugfixes, including
the close-to-open patches which are important when you are updating
files centrally on a server.
It probably isn't the cause of problems here though (if I read the
section below correctly).

You are updating an executable while the clients are running it??? 
Bad! That is not meant to work...
