There were no 0.04 to 0.09.
I was unable to find 0.02 and 0.03 via Archie or Altavista. Seems they
got lost in time :-(

I think 0.95 came directly after 0.12. Did you check Linus' article on Linux
history and 
http://www.cs.buffalo.edu/~thies/Linux?

No. Several patches exist, including ELF support and support for gcc 2.7.2
with new binutils, but there never was an official 1.0.10.
