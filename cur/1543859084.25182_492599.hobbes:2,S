Ok. That is actually _very_ interesting.
It's interesting because (a) the corruption obviously goes away with the 
one-liner that effectively disables "page_mkclean_one()".
So that tells us that yes, it's a PTE dirty bit that matters.
But at the same time, it's interesting that it still happens when we try 
to re-add the dirty bit. That would tell me that it's one of two cases:
 - there is another caller of page cleaning that should have done the same 
   thing (we could check that by just doing this all _inside_ the 
   page_mkclean() thing)
OR:
 - page_mkclean_one() is simply buggy.
And I'm starting to wonder about the second case. But it all LOOKS really 
fine - I can't see anything wrong there (it uses the extremely 
conservative "ptep_get_and_clear()", and seems to flush everything right 
too, through "ptep_establish()").
