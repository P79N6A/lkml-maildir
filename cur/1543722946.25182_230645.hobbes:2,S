Yes.
So checking whether this is POSIX conforming:
- Blocking a signal in its signal handler is explicitly allowed.
  (signal(3p))
- It is unspecified what longjmp() does with the signal mask.
  (longjmp(3p))
- The SIGSEGV that occurs during a stack overflow is of the GodFather kind.
  (getrlimit(3p))
- If SIGSEGV is generated while blocked, the result is undefined
  (sigprocmask(3p))
So, maybe the restoring to SIG_DFL was not required, but it doesnt seem
incorrect either. It may be a bit surprising.
