When you recompiled your kernel for SMP a file called System.map was
created in the /usr/src/linux directory (assuming that /usr/src/linux is
where your src tree is). 
Copy this file to /boot/System.map-2.2.5-15smp.
Alternatively you could simply grab a more up to date kernel rpm (2.2.5-15
contains some serious security issues) which should install the System.map
correctly.
