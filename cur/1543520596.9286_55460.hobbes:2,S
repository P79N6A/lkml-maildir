Could the designer of the non-executable-stack code please explain how
this works on an ix86 machine?  The ix86 can't differentiate
between read and execute in hardware. This means that either the
patch for ix86 is a no-op or, (I shudder), a trap is executed on
every user stack access, and the kernel code does a comparison.
Now, if the trap occurs on every access, you have a lot of overhead that
should be bench-marked so that users can make security decisions based
upon knowledge rather than emotion.
If the trap occurs only when the code-segment is changed within the
user environment, you haven't fixed anything because the stack may
be reachable within the current code-segment, although not at the
current offset.
If the trap occurs by marking pages not present and having the page-fault
handler confirm/deny access, you have the problem of granularity. A
lot of rogue code can fit within a page.
So, just how does this new code work? Or is it a feature for the Suns
only? 
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
