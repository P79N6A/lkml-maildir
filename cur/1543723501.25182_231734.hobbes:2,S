I guess here's what has triggered the warning by the tool:
get_branch may try to acquire pointers_lock (itree.c:103) on one of its
paths, which was held (line 287) by find_shared...

fh_put calls fh_unlock(fhp), which "up"s fhp->fh_dentry->d_inode->i_sem. 
two calls in a row "up"s that semaphore twice, which upset the tool and 
triggered the warning.
