I used to have a patch that implemented a /sysfs/slab/ layer, where 
you could get all of the /proc/slabinfo information via sysfs
conveniently. Sadly, it went to wherever bad harddisks go when they
die. Since I need it for a different endeavour, I'll ressurect it
eventually. That should make the parsing in slabinfo a lot simpler.
