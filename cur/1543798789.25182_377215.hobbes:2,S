Subject: [PATCH] update Toshiba ohci quirk DMI table

I upgraded my Toshiba Satellite BIOS recently to see if it would fix an 
ACPI related problem I have 
(
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5727
).  Unfortunately, it 
didn't, and moreover, Toshiba chose to change the system version in the 
DMI table with the update, causing the OHCI1394 related quirk to break.  
This patch updates the DMI table for the quirk to include Toshiba's new 
version name for this machine; I've tested it and it seems to work 
fine.
