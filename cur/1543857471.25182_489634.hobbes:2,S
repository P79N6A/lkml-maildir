Yeah, I'm not fond of that, though the comments on simple_fill_super should
explain it. Basically, I need simple_fill_super to operate in two different
"modes", and I was using the extra flag to key this. I'm not clear on what
sort of #define would make sense here. Can you suggest something?

I thought those were under 80 columns but perhaps they weren't. I'll clean
them up and repost, once you clarify what you'd like to see in the #define.

I wasn't planning on touching those parts of the code that don't need to be
changed, since formatting deltas can make it harder to see the "actual"
changes in the patch. That should probably be addressed in a follow-on
patch if you think it needs to be changed.
