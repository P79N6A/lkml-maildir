Okay, done.

Well, I was actually looking at scsi.c, where this kind of thing is common:
    spin_lock_irqsave(host->host_lock, flags);
    scsi_done(cmd);
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(host->host_lock, flags);
If those locks are not needed, the scsi.c maintainer really should
nuke'em.  Meanwhile, I'll take them out of qstor.c as well, thanks.

Not yet, but I have tested them with other scsiinfo-like tools.
Again, when it is proven to be an issue with something, it will get fixed.

Well, after this driver submission work is done with,
that's next on my list.  Right now libata doesn't have
the right interface for easy sharing of such functions.
And the driver will need it's own copy in some versions anyway,
since this driver will be used on much older/earlier kernels
than just the ones with the latest libata stuff.
Cheers
