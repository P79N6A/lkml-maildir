Eric has said that his understanding was that syscall switches (ie,
syscalls with subcommands) were bad form.
I understand the concern, but I think while it's still in prototype
stages, that it's a sensible and pragmatic approach. Once individual
subcommands are "finalised" then they can be split out into a seperate
syscall, and any level of backwards compatibility can be maintained by
whoever needs it.

I've been a bit backlogged of late. I'll put some time towards it this
week, of course patches are always welcome and will find a home on utsl :).
