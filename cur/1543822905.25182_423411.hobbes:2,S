Yes, but until we have a proper infrastructure for that, we have to
disable the smbus unhiding as a safe fix.
If you have the time to whip up a patch to add a sane quirks-on-resume
infrastructure, I'd be grateful. See the thread
"[RFC] [PATCH] Execute PCI quirks on resume from suspend-to-RAM" for
some ugly proof-of-concept.
My main motivation was to prevent bricking my laptop. Added functionality
is desirable, but secondary.
Regards,
