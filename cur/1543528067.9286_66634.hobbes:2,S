i believe IRQ7 is a tad overloaded here. Do you see any system instability
when the spurious IRQ message appears? The parallel port and the sound
card are both using IRQ7. Plus IRQ7 is the IRQ for the motherboard to
report spurious interrupts (it's a bit more complex than this but thats
the gist of it).
but still, i do not yet understand why this happens now and didnt happen
with earlier kernels, hm.
