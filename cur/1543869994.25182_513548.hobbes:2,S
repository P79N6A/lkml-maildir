After experimenting here, it turns out the reason is you're trying to
configure a port with a zero base baud.  Unfortunately, it starts off
as zero.
However, when you try to change a port without specifying the base baud,
it is possible for the port to become "usable" and unless we enforce
the "must not have zero base baud" rule we have the possibility to oops
the kernel via a divide by zero.
So, the answer is to specify the base baud when using setserial to
configure new ports.
