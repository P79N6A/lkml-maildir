This patch is a bit too random for me.
Sure, if you wnat to do a cleanup of signal.c and pdflush.c then feel free
to do so, but I don't think this does it.  It's just a little touchup of a
couple of places.  My concern is that we could apply 1000 patches like
that.  Would much prefer less, larger, more comprehensive patches.
