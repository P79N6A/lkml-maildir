True.  Each driver author would make a decision, for what's best to
appear in their probe time printk's...

It was simple for existing code, I agree, but IMHO not correct WRT the
dev->name error case mentioned earlier, and also different from the rest
of the kernel driver APIs.

true enough...

Sorry -- I just rechecked the code, and I was mistaken.  dev-init() is
called earlier than I had thought..

I don't understand your point here.  init_etherdev and alloc_etherdev
users get by just fine without dev->init().  My thought is that
dev->init is not needed at all -- simply require initialization before
register_netdev[ice] is called.

Please let me know what bugs you find in the vanilla kernel...
