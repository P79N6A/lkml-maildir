Like I said, look at bdflush in 2.4 (this was fixed with the changed 2.6
interface) and xfs proc interface in both 2.4 and 2.6.
In light of your post then there is a serious bug.
For example for bdflush age_buffer field (true for the other used fields
also), no conversion:
	bh->b_flushtime = jiffies + bdf_prm.b_un.age_buffer;
For xfs flush interval:
if (pbd_active == 1) {
			mod_timer(&pb_daemon_timer,
				  jiffies + pb_params.flush_interval.val);
			interruptible_sleep_on(&pbd_waitq);
		}
xfs should be converted to centisecs, bdflush should also be converted
to centisecs, or the interface from 2.6 should somehow be ported to
exist in parallel to the 2.4 one.
I don't mind making a patch, which approach should be used?
