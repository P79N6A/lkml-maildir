To drop strings that are only shown once anyway, such as:
static int __init ebtables_init(void)
{
        int ret;
        mutex_lock(&ebt_mutex);
        list_add(&ebt_standard_target.list, &ebt_targets);
        mutex_unlock(&ebt_mutex);
        if ((ret = nf_register_sockopt(&ebt_sockopts)) < 0)
                return ret;
->      printk(KERN_INFO "Ebtables v2.0 registered\n");
        return 0;
}
