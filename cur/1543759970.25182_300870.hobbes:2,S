For space, there is a small benefit. On my system with 1.5GiB of RAM, it
is about 130 bytes saved for prezeroing and about 220 with just the
placement policy.  For speed, I do not know how bitmaps normally perform
with the CPU cache, but for the placement policy, it makes no difference.
I implemented a version using char[] array and there was no performance
difference that I could measure. The bitmaps just are not consulted often
enough to make a big performance difference.
