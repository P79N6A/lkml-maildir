The biggest sticking point as far as I'm concerned with this patchset
is the source readability after applying it.
Something really needs to be done about the #if pollution this
patch adds before it's ready for inclusion. The whole patchset adds
over 700 #if's/ifdefs/ifndefs.
In a lot of cases you even do this..
+#ifdef PC9800
+	unsigned long foo
+#endif
	...
+#ifdef PC9800
+ code using foo
+#endif
where foo could have been moved inside a {} section in the ifdef
which is using it.   This is one of the simpler cases, there's
also a whole bunch of stuff where you don't even need ifdefs at all
(around #defines for example)
I see you've gone to the effort of making sure the generated code
is the same if PC9800 support is compiled out, which is good.
The next step is to get the source clean enough that those that
don't care about PC9800 don't have to hurt their eyes untangling
a web of #if's.
