All,
Sorry about the recent fdtable badness that you all encountered. I'm working
on getting a fix out there.
Dave, Olof, Linas, Bryce,
Could you please test the patch at the bottom of the email to see if it makes
your computers happy again, if you have the time and inclination to do so?
Andrew,
Would you prefer me to resend a fixed patch #4, or a new fix (#5) on top of
what's in your tree?
