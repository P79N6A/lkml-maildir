This is pointless. The 'make -C $KERNELDIR SUBDIRS=`pwd`' form has been
working since at least 2.0, and surely nobody's trying to build for 1.3
kernels any more? Just do it the latter way unconditionally.

In fact, the kbuild system just uses strings for the SUBDIRS variable...
it doesn't inspect them to check for '..' in them and deliberately barf
(although perhaps it should :).
ifndef TOPDIR
# Invoked from the command line... do it properly
# KERNELDIR can be overridden on the command line
KERNELDIR := /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
default:
	make -C $(KERNELDIR) SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules
else
# Invoked from the kernel build...
SUBDIRS := ../../../../t/s../../../f/c ../../../f/i s
ag-objs := ../../../../t/s/ts.o ../../../f/c/fc.o ../../../f/i/fi.o \
		s/sl.o 
obj-m := ag.o
endif
