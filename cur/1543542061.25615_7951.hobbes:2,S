Hey, move a few drivers from drivers/scsi there too, and you'll have a few
hundred .c files there.
If you didn't guess already, I disagree strongly with people moving USB
drivers around. I don't see the logic in it, AT ALL.
The USB drivers use "kmalloc()" to allocate memory. Does that mean that
they are part of memory management, and we should move them to mm/drivers?
Obviously not. Nobody would be stupid enough to really argue that. Yet
people seem to argue that because some USB drivers use features offered by
the input layer, they should be "input drivers". Not so.
