It shrinks the .text on i386 considerably too. One reason
is that it automatically enables regparms for static functions.
With global CONFIG_REGPARM the shrink is a bit less, but still
noticeable.
One drawback is that oopses are harder to read because
of the more aggressive inlining, but it's not too bad.

Maybe you got a buggy gcc version. The 2.6.5 based SLES9/i386
kernel is shipping with -funit-at-a-time compiled with a 3.3-hammer
compiler and I am not aware of any reports of stack overflow
(and that kernel is extremly well tested) 
IMHO it should be enabled on i386 in mainline, and if some gcc version
is determined to break it then it should be only explicitely 
disabled for that version. With the commonly used 3.3-hammer
compiler it seems to work fine.

The only reports of stack overflows on x86-64 were clear programmer
bugs (too large arrays/structures on the stack).
