Fantastic. I'm going to try and finish up your suggested changes tonight
and get it to work with CONFIG_LOCK_STAT off. It's been challenging to
find time to do Linux these days, so I don't mind handing it off to you
after this point so that you and tweek it to your heart's content.
Yeah, one of the major motivations behind it was to see if Solaris style
locks were useful and to either validate or invalidate their usefulness.
Because of this patch, we have an idea of what's going on with regard to
adaptive spinning and such. The sensible conclusion is that it's not
sophistication of the lock, but parallelizing the code in the first
place to prevent the contention in the first place that's the key
philosophical drive.
I forward merged it into rc6-rt2 and you can expect a drop tonight of
what I have regardless whether it's perfect or not.
