It seems that several keyboards have both HomePage and WWW keys:
All these AT keyboards are from Xorg symbols/inet.
A4Tech Wireless Desktop 
BTC 9000A
Compaq Easy Access Keyboard

Logitech (common definition)
Logitech Internet Keyboard
Microsoft Office Keyboard
It would be nice if anybody can test similar AT/USB keyboard.
