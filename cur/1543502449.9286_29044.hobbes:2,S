Hi,
I get this output from ``free'' on my system after about 26 hours of
uptime:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         31000      27124       3876      11160    4191696      21216
-/+ buffers/cache:       8516      22484
Swap:        98780       5032      93748
It seems that the buffers value has run amuck.
Here is the output from ``uname -a'':
Linux hafnium.nkbj.dk 2.3.11 #1 lør jul 10 15:16:50 CEST 1999 i486 unknown
Am I the only one to have observed such behaviour?
Please CC any answers to me.
