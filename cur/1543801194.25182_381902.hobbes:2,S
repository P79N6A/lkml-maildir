Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Fix problems on multi-TB filesystem and file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/5/69

This fix was proposed by Trond Myklebust.  He says:
 The type "sector_t" is heavily tied in to the block layer interface
 as an offset/handle to a block, and is subject to a supposedly
 block-specific configuration option: CONFIG_LBD. Despite this, it is
 used in struct kstatfs to save a couple of bytes on the stack
 whenever we call the filesystems' ->statfs().
So kstatfs's entries related to blocks are invalid on statfs64 for a
network filesystem which has more than 2^32-1 blocks when CONFIG_LBD
is disabled.
The content of the patch attached to this mail is below.
- struct kstatfs
  Change the type of following entries from sector_t to u64.
  f_blocks
  f_bfree
  f_bavail
  f_files
  f_ffree
Any feedback and comments are welcome.
