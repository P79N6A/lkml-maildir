What's the point in keeping the OS running if the applications are silently
killed?
If your box is running for example a mail server, and it appears that
another process is juste eating the free memory, do you really want to kill
the mail server, just because it's the main process and consuming more
memory and CPU than others?
Well, fine, your OS is up, but your application is not here anymore.
I just think there's no general solution, users must have the chance to
choose processes not to be killed, or malloc() returning errors.
