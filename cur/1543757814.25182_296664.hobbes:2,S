Yes, it sounds sane.
The 2.6.8.1 ELSA patch adds quite a bit of kernel code, but from what
you're saying it seems like most of that has become redundant, and all
you now need is the fork notifier.  Is that correct?
That 2.6.8.1 ELSA patch looks reasonable to me - it only adds two lines to
generic code and the rest looks pretty straightforward.  Are we sure that
this level of functionality is not sufficient for everyone else?

Oh, I wasn't proposing that it all be done via existing /proc interfaces -
I was just getting my head straight ;)
