That is a symptom of a broken klogd.  Always run klogd with the -x
switch.  If that does not work, take a look at
ftp://ftp
.<country>.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ksymoops/v2.4/patch-sysklogd-1-3-31-ksymoops-1.gz
One day the sysklogd maintainers might just fix this bug, that bug fix
is almost 2 years old.
