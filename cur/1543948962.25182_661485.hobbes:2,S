Sorry for reposting it.
For example,
1 rdtsc() is invoked on CPU0
2 process is migrated to CPU1, and rdtsc() is invoked on CPU1
3 if TSC on CPU1 is slower than TSC on CPU0, can kernel guarantee
that the second rdtsc() doesn't return a value smaller than the one
returned by the first rdtsc()?
Thanks,
Forrest
