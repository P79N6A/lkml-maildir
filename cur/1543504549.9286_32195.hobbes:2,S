	Few tweaks??? Full rewrite of data-related part. I've found what
was wrong with my code. Finally. And it's not a pretty sight. Basically
with the serialization between write() and truncate() gone the whole
handling of cluster allocation (extending/truncating the chains) fell
apart. Wouldn't be too bad, if we wouldn't have to keep all data in page
cache when we extend the bloody thing. No holes in files, damnit... Oh,
well... At least it solves the problem with dmsdos - solution for normal
fatfs will work there too.
