For Resource Management to be useful it must depend on Resource Control.  
Resource Control depends on per-process accounting.  Per-process accounting, 
when abstracted sufficiently, may enable higher level routines, preferrably 
in userland, to extend functionality at will.  All efforts should really go 
into the successful abstraction of per-process accounting.
