{Shrug} Perhaps somebody can suggest some way that capabilities can
have meaning for a script, any script if it comes to that?
The best I've seen so far is for any script to require the
capabilities of whichever interpreter it uses, in which case a capable
script would use a different version of the interpreter that included
the capabilities the script needed, and to my way of thinking, such a
scheme is open to abuse...
Personally, I can see NO sensible meaning for attaching capabilities
to a script, at least not from an implementation viewpoint, and until
somebody comes up with a sensible meaning for doing so, I see no point
in even allowing scripts to be given capabilities separate from the
interpreter they use...
Best wishes from Riley.
