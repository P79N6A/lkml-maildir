We were getting this error on 4 of our arrays. We weren't able to track
down the original error, but the continuing problem turned out to be that
in "correcting" the errors fsck did not restore the drive to a stable
state and it would eventually corrupt itself again. 
If this is the same problem, force fsck until it no longer finds any
errors on the drive.
