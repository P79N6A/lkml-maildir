Yes, in 64bit mode ss:rsp is restore unconditionally. In compatibility and
legacy modes it's restored only if the CPL changes.
kernel never runs in compatibility mode (and userspace never runs iret) so in
kernel_thread we know x86-64 always restores ss:rsp from the stack.
You should find this as a familiar behaviour as you just tried to pass a stack
via kernel_thread in your latest patch against cvs :).
