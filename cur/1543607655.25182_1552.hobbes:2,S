What about putting them somewhere in a CVS repository, so people can see
what's going on and maybe even can help out?
BTW you should really do something about your coding style, your code is
very confusing to read. I wouldn't care if it would be just some driver,
but devfs is supposed to be a very important part, so it would be nice
to use the same rules that apply to other important parts of the kernel.
