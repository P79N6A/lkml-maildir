yeah the explicit reference makes the stack pointer tracking engine do a
commit I suspect which then also creates a data dependency in the code
flow.
however... this is likely a good argument for making cond_resched() as a
whole a #define (or inline) that does this test and then calls the out
of line code (which then doesn't need to retest, so it avoids the
double test)...
