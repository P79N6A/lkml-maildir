That's not correct.
Qt was pulished under the QPL. The QPL is an open source license. The 
only problems was that the QPL is not compatible with the GPL.
There were copyright problems since some small parts of KDE (IIRC e.g. 
kghostview) contain GPL'ed code not written by the KDE developers.
Since version 2.2 Qt is dual-licenced under both the QPL and the GPL 
(you can choose under which license you want to use it.
Trolltech has the same control over Qt as Linus over the Linux kernel.
There's no license reason today why there are two big desktop projects 
(GNOME and KDE).
