The inability to see the propagation tree was one major block towards
the use of sharedsubtree. Patch (1) fills up that gap and hence
absolutely needed. I view the remaining patches as patches directly
or indirectly supporting (1). 
As far as the 'mind boggling complex code' I believe the container folks
use it or at-least plan to use it. I know one our software groups
actively leveraging this functionality.
