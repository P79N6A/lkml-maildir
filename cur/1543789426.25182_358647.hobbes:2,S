Yes. 
You can try the current git tree, or just change "maxbatch" from 10 to 
10000 in your own tree, and see if it makes a difference.
I would not be surprised at all if this turns out to be the exact same 
issue, for the exact same reason.
Eric's patch is also likely to fix it (if the "maxbatch" change fixes it), 
since I suspect that under _practical_ load Eric's patch works fine.
The advantage of Eric's patch is that it shouldn't have any latency 
downsides, so Eric's is in many ways preferable to just increasing 
maxbatch. I just can't convince myself that it's really always going to 
fix the problem.
If somebody else can, holler.
