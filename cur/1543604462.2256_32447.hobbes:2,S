You are copying the IP header from an 84 byte packet, so the size is set
to 84 => the IP stack only reads the first 84 bytes.

You changed the size field, but didn't recalculate the checksum. The
destination would then reject this packet as having a corrupted header.

Yes, I think so. That, and the rest of the header.

If you want to send packets over Ethernet, you are implementing your own
protocol. Alternatively, you can tunnel your BlueTooth packets over IP, as
you have been doing (but remember to fix the header fields this time!)
Also, you don't need a second copy of the IP header; one will do. At the
transmission end, insert your BT header between the IP header and payload,
changing the fields in the IP header accordingly (including protocol; with
your BT header in place, it is no longer a TCP/UDP/ICMP packet). At the
receiving end, I take it you want to pass the original packet over
Bluetooth? In which case, swap the headers round (and change the fields in
the IP header back the way they were to start with).
You may need more space after the BT header to store the fields you
displace from the IP header.

A packet sniffer should help here...
