If we add some grouping mechanism for tasks (CKRM or PAGG), then this 
could be handled easily by adjusting the per-task limit based on the
number of tasks in the group? For example, when make is started, it
could be the only task in the group, with a per-task (& group_limit) of 50%. 
As it forks more tasks, the per-task limit of everyone in the group is 
adjusted (lazily perhaps at the next scheduler tick time) based on the 
group_limit/num_of_tasks_in_group. 
This would still require a resource control daemon to adjust the
per-task limit of tasks within a group (if some task in underutilizing
its bandwidth for example).
