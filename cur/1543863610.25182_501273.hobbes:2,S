Yes of course, but I've disabled that end-user stuff, and for
convenience even tested the whole thing with runlevel 1 (single user).

Yes I knew,.. I just wondered because that worked even when no player
was started at all. But I found out that this must depend on GNOME,
because when mount + eject-button from single-user,.. the disc is not
ejected.
Anyway it is ejected (+unmounted) when using the eject command (but I
assume that this is normal).
