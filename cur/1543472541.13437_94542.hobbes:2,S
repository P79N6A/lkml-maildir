There seem to be fairly significant parallels between Linux's
support of special partitions for swap, and the arguments for 
raw disk I/O.
If the arguments against raw-io are technically correct, why
do we still support partition level access to swap ?
Assuming there's little performance difference between swap
partitions and swap files, swap files are a big win. No hardwired
decision on how much swap is needed, just create a swap file
in one of the filesystems. If you find it's too big or too small it
can be resized easilly. (Unlike a partition). 
On the flip side, if swap partitions do give some advantages, surely
the same justification can be made for supporting raw-io.
Note: I'm not saying the two cases are identical, just that there
are fairly major simillarities.
I appreciate that it's far easier to keep something out of
the kernel in the first place than to remove it later. However
in the case of swap partitions I'm confident they could be removed
painlessly. Just turn the partition into an e2fs one and create one
large file. (Worst case).
