What is this error?  Twice now I have made what seemed
(at the time) simple changes to my config file, and each time
I have ended up with a kernel that spewed the message:
    drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: control queue full
up the screen, late in the boot.  The only way out is with
a <ctl><alt><del>, and of course I had NEVER saved my previous
config file, so it is never obvious what change I had made.
Each time has wasted a couple of hours of debug time...
Any suggestions (other than 'dont try to use the USB stuff'...)
will be appreciated.
