Hi,
The following is a patch to the pcmcia code in which a kmalloc failure could
cause the code to crash since the pointer is dereferenced. I've instead
allocated the fixed sized array on the stack. The patch was made against
v2.4.4 of the kernel and result from some errors found during checker runs
against the kernel source.
