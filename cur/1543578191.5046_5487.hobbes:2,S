Incompatibility with "Sarotech FHD-352F/U Rev 1.0"
Using an external IDE drive in the Sarotech FireWire enclosure fails, even
though the Sarotech unit works with Win2K and other SBP2 drives work for me
(with Linux).
I'm using 2.4.0 together with sbp2_1394_122300.tar.gz.
ACK code 3 is not even mentioned in ieee1394.h.
I understand that the SBP2 driver is not (yet) included, but it will be shortly.
Also, I guess the same problem applies to raw1394.o together with the Sarotech
enclosure.
