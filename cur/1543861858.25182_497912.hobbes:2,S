For the non-simple case, it isn't that we 'ignore' the revocation,
but we prevent the cause for demotion to occur.  The current status is
that for those cases we can revoke, we demote the process and do the
revocation, and for those cases which we can't revoke, we prevent the 
process from being demoted.
