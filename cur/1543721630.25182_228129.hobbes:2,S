That's right Al, 4Front, ATI, Nvidia are all evil!. OK so now get on with life.
It's time everybody started to pay some attention to in-kernel interfaces because
Linux has graduated out of your personal sandbox to where other people want to use
Linux and they aren't kernel developers.
Sure we can fix the problem with SuSE - we've been doing this for the past 7 years.
And we know a thing or two about Linux kernels but wouldn't it be better for the
Linux community in general to have such source issue stabilized?
