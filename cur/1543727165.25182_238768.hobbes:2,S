Are these going to be numbered consecutively, or might
they better be done like the task state? SCHED_FIFO is
in fact already treated this way in one place. One might
want to test values this way:
if(foo & (SCHED_ISO|SCHED_RR|SCHED_FIFO))  ...
(leaving aside SCHED_OTHER==0, or just translate
that single value for the ABI)
I'd like to see these get permenant allocations
soon, even if the code doesn't go into the kernel.
This is because user-space needs to know the values.
