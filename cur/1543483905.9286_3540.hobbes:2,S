Subject: bp_xid mismatch during rpc call.   2.2.0-pre9 & 2.2.1 (nfs mounte d root on eth1)

I have 2.2.0-pre9 running on a Davinci (Rawhide/Davinci) or "Ultimate
workstation" (ALPHA). 
If  I have it configured to mount the root file-system from a Digital Unix
server using eth0, everything works fine. 
But if I have a configuration that uses eth1 to mount the nfs root
file-system, Everything appears to work .ie. remote filesystems mount, all
the applicable inittab entries execute, but then I get an RPC failure during
a call to the server. 
bp_xid mismatch got 0x36b753e5 sent 0x63e502b5
If I use eth0, it works. Is there a restriction on using anything but eth0
as the device through which  the root fs can be NFS mounted?
