Yes, a development tree is much different than a stable tree, and even
though the number has gone to 2.6, it's very much a development tree, in
that it's still being used by the same people, and probably not getting
a lot of new testing. Stability is unlikely to be production quality
until fixes go in for problems in mass testing, which won't happen until
it shows up in a vendor release, which won't happen until the vendors
test and clean up what they find... In other words, I don't expect it to
be "really stable" for six months at least, maybe a year.
As for "much faster," let's say that I don't see that on any apples to
apples benchmark. If you measure new threading against 2.4 threading
there is a significant gain, but for anything else the gains just don't
seem to warrant a "much" and there are some regressions shown in other
people's data.
I think 2.6 has new features, it is more scalable, but other than
threads I don't see any huge performance gains.
