I've come across the following problems:
 1. Some BIOS's have problems booting from single cylinder
    partitions.
 2. Systems that need to multi-boot between Linux, WinXX and OS/2
    appear to have problems with partitions that only occupy a
    single cylinder. In particular, OS/2 appears to play up very
    badly although, curiously enough, Win9x has no problem with it.
 3. Some versions of Linux fdisk appear to be unable to create
    single cylinder partitions. The main culprit here appears to
    be the version of fdisk used by certain Slackware installs,
    although the version actually installed has no such problem.
As a result, I generally avoid any problems by allocating a minimum of
two cylinders to each partition.
Best wishes from Riley.
