Some minutes after my mail I realized that it was some hw related issue
possible casued by weak cooling or something and mingo said me the same
too in private.

As you can see merge_segments+25 is not on opcode boundary !
By  the way the compiler is : egcs-1.1.2 (2.91.66)
[latest gcc package from Debian potato)
