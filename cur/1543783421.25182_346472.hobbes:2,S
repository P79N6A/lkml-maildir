But in the shared IRQ and other source is the other uart still
registered to the real 8250 driver, we'd luck out.  I know this has been
tested on a shared serial irq box, so it's not immediate and always

interrupt that occured on an (probably) an x86_64 box when NMI support
didn't work correctly.  I think it's safe enough to just drop this.
