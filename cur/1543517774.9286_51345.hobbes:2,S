Duh. I know that. One proposal was to use access permissions on the
directory to determine if hardlinking was allowed. Yuk.

And I want the opposite: I want any user to be able to make hard links
to my files, without needing write access to the inodes, and without
needing some stupid set{u|g}id binary.
Maybe you work in a hostile environment, but I (usually) work in a
co-operative environment. That usually means no quotas, most
directories readable and executable by everyone and so on.
The changes you propose prevent efficient work in a co-operative
environment. Thus it's a bad idea.
If you really want to stop people from "capturing" your quota space
(which they can't really, they can only prevent you from cleaning up),
then lock your directories away from others! Don't invent more complex
permissions checking (and require privileged programmes to get back
the old, desirable facilty) which isn't needed anyway.

In that case there's no conceivable reason to change the VFS. Nor any
FS that can deal with hard links.
