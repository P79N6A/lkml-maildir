Come on, that's absolutely a red herring.  There are valid reasons to
want to configure your color schemes, but Aunt Tillie is not one of
them.  Do you seriously believe the novice user will ever futz with a
~/.kernelconfigrc file?  I don't.  Only the (relatively) advanced user
will bother to figure out stuff like that.
If you want your aunt to be able to set her own colors, you basically
have to provide an 'Edit / Preferences...' drop-down or equivalent, and
I think we all know we don't want to go *there*....

Which basically means Eric and the others have long since shaken out
the serious bugs.  -- Except for the famous 20-second parse, which of
course accounts for the *other* 50% of recent CML2 traffic.
