Still, most of the times it is acquired would be once per page for
read, write, nopage.
For read and write, often it will be a full page memcpy but even such
a memcpy operation can quickly become insignificant compared to tl
contention.
Anyway, whatever. What needs to be demonstrated are real world
improvements at the end of the day.

No. Cool numbers though ;)
