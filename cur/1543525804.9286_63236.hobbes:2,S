The last Draft published (16) and the final version which was
withdrawn (17) have three capability sets:
	inheritable - what can be passed on
	permitted   - what the process can request and get
	effective   - what the process gets on exec
These sets are exactly the same as what a process has. The calculation
of the capability set on exec is designed to allow proper capability
assignment for both capability aware and capability ignorant programs.
The Draft may be obtained from:

it may be the last great troff document.
