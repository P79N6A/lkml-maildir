static int unshare_sighand(unsigned long unshare_flags, struct sighand_struct **new_sighp)
It's all just a place-holder at present.
If we don't plan on ever supporting unshare(CLONE_SIGHAND) we should take
that code out and make it return EINVAL.  Right now.
And because we don't presently support CLONE_SIGHAND we should return
EINVAL if it's set.  Right now.
And we should change sys_unshare() to reject not-understood flags.  Right
now.
If we don't do these things we'll silently break 2.6.16-back-compatibility
of applications which are coded for future kernels.
