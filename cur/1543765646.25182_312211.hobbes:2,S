Correct me if I'm wrong here, but uniformity of the linear function isn't
sufficant even if we implemented like this (right now it's more a+X than
a <dot> X).
The part which suggests choosing an irreducible poly and a value "a" in the
preprocessing stage ... last I checked the value for a and the poly need to
be secret.  How do you generate poly and a, Catch-22?  Perhaps I'm missing
something and someone can point it out.
