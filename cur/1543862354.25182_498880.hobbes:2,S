It is easy to see the cause of this.
There is an old problem with the Linux whole disk device /dev/hda
namely that there is aliasing with /dev/hdaN.
I don't know whether there exist kernels that fix this problem -
as far as I know this has been a problem since ancient times.
But, given the fact that this is a well-known problem of the kernel,
a utility should be careful to avoid problems and flush buffers
at appropriate times.
Now that lilo is one of the few utilities to write to /dev/hda,
it should be fixed.
[And yes, also the kernel should be fixed.]
