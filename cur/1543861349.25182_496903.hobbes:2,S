For one thing, the fact that it doesn't account for stolen time.  But 
mostly because going through the regular PIT / APIC timer paths has a 
lot of overhead.  So we need a separate timer device, and weaving this 
in with the local APIC timer dependency for SMP on i386 requires changes 
on top of NO_HZ.
