Hmm, if I checked correctly, your motherboard (Asus CUSL2) doesn't seem to
include a HPT374 based (integrated) IDE-controller. Are you using some
add-on PCI-card for IDE ? If yes, are you using older style Parallel-ATA
or newer Serial-ATA interface ?

Based on previous questions and answers on this list, those settings
might very well affect you, as they affect the way interrupts are handled
in your system. Unfortunately, they haven't fixed my problems no matter
what I combination I have tried.
