I thought I would give the 2.3.18 kernel a shot to see how it was vs. the
2.2 kernels.  Well, the first build did not go so well on the 21164SX
systems.  This is what I got:
/usr/src/axp-2.3.18/include/asm/processor.h:118: warning: `struct
task_struct' declared inside parameter list
/usr/src/axp-2.3.18/include/asm/processor.h:118: warning: its scope is only
this definition or declaration,
/usr/src/axp-2.3.18/include/asm/processor.h:118: warning: which is probably
not what you want.
fbmem.c: In function `fb_mmap':
fbmem.c:537: too few arguments to function `ioremap'
make[3]: *** [fbmem.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/axp-2.3.18/drivers/video'
make[2]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/axp-2.3.18/drivers/video'
make[1]: *** [_subdir_video] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/axp-2.3.18/drivers'
make: *** [_dir_drivers] Error 2
The asm dir was linked to the right place.. anyway..  l8z
