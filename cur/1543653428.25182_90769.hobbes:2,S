The output of all the startup scripts is logged by a special daemon to 
a log file (blogd). It does this by redirecting /dev/console.
For it to be able to still output something to the screen and later 
resetting the console it needs to know the output device that
/dev/console maps to. The ioctl returns it. 
There is actually a fallback path that tries to discover the underlying
device when the ioctl is not there, but it is far too ugly to describe
and also has some problems.
