Hi Nick,

It just guarantees constant lookup time for small/large files.
My context based read-ahead code has been quite tricky just to avoid many radix
tree lookups. I made it much simple and robust in the recent versions by just
scanning through the cache. With the help of look-aside cache, the performance
remains comparable with the tricky one. Sorry, the oprofile log was overwrote.
But if you do need some numbers about the cache, I'll make one.

Most are one-liners, except radix_tree_cache_lookup_node(). Which is about 10
lines. Currently it is always called with a constant @level, where inline can
help. Only several speed critical functions call it, so I guess icache misses
will not be a big problem. But I do feel it ugly to expose internal data
structures in .h :(

Ok. I'll try it.

Ok, here it is:
 void func() {
+       struct radix_tree_cache cache;
+
+       radix_tree_cache_init(&cache);
        read_lock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock);
        for(;;) {
-               page = radix_tree_lookup(&mapping->page_tree, index);
+               page = radix_tree_cache_lookup(&mapping->page_tree, &cache, index);
        }
        read_unlock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock);
 }

Sorry for the ugly code. It is better written as:
        if (cache->first_index & RADIX_TREE_MAP_MASK)
                return 0;
        else
                return cache->tree_node->count;
The 0x77 is an invalid value that will be detected in radix_tree_cache_lookup_node():
        mask = ~((RADIX_TREE_MAP_SIZE << (level * RADIX_TREE_MAP_SHIFT)) - 1);
--->    if ((index & mask) == cache->first_index)
                return cache->tree_node->slots[i];
        node = radix_tree_lookup_node(root, index, level + 1);
It can be initialized to 1, 0xFF, or any i that (i & RADIX_TREE_MAP_MASK != 0).
I'd better just init it as RADIX_TREE_MAP_MASK.
