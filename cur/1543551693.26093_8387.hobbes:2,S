the pragmatic and subjective part. Jeff wrote some cool nwfs code for
Linux which is publically available and what useful kernel code for Linux
did you write and where can I download it? Therefore, for this very simple
subjective and pragmatic reason, Jeff (in my eyes) is right and you are
wrong :)
Send patches, not "clever thoughts", clever thoughts are cheap and useless
and can remain confined to the "comp. science departments of certain
universities" for all I care...
