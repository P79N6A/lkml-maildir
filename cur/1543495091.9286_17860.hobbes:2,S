Initial report....
I just installed my new IBM Ultra66 22GB drive and a Promise Ultra66
controller.  The machine is an older Pentium 120, 64MB ram with i430FX
chipset.
I applied your patch and rebooted...
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.19
PIIX: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 38
PIIX: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PIIX: neither IDE port enabled (BIOS)

hde: IBM-DJNA-372200, 21557MB w/1966kB Cache, CHS=43800/16/63, UDMA(66)
hdc: ATAPI 4X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache
My hdparm -Tt numbers improved quite a bit...
Before my new IBM drive was slave to my samsung drive on the motherboard
ide controller.
The numbers were this:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  4.35 seconds = 29.40 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 18.44 seconds = 3.47 MB/sec
And after moving the IBM drive to the Promise Ultra66 controller and using
an Ultra66 cable the numbers look like this:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  4.21 seconds =30.40 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.24 seconds =12.21 MB/sec
In what other ways can I test / stress test this new code?  I'm going to
setup nfs and samba going to that drive and pound on it.
