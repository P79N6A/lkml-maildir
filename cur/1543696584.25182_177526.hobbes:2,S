Seems to be bidirectional.

ext3

The client is running AS2.1, RH's 2.4.9-e12. Server is RH AS 3.0, 2.4.22
stock, and 2.6.0-test9, 2.6.0-test9-bk11. Transfers in both directions.

The raw file read/write is the ticket. The box tightens right up at 100% iowait.
I'd done bonnie++ i/o tests already, and except for an apparent NPTL issue on the per char,
the block i/o numbers were fine; no abnormal results whatsoever. In fact, block r/w
numbers were improved compared to 2.4.22. Now that I'm looking for it, however, I 
do note extremely elevated iowait numbers during a bonnie++ run. Something in the MPT
modules?
