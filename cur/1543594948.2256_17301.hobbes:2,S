IANAL, and this may be a dumb question, but what about LGPLing the driver
abstraction layer and/or headers? (Presuming of course there -is- a driver
abstraction layer that would work for 99% of the drivers.)  That leaves
the kernel safe (since LGPL says link whatever under whichever license,
GPL is valid for kernel core) and -specifically- allows any license you
like for HW/SW vendors who want to make modules.
