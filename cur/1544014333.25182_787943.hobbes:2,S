As I said elsewhere, the network namespaces do not matter, since we
always create the sockets via the rpciod workqueue.

The administrator would have to be running wireshark or something in
order to track the rpc calls. That's hardly a convenient interface, or a
compelling reason to add namespace info into RPC credentials. We
certainly haven't added any other information to the RPC calls in order
to allow the administrator to identify which process it originated from.
