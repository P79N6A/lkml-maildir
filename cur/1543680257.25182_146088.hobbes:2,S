I submited the some patch to marcelo several times about one year ago,
however, unfortunately those patches was ignored.
So, one large patch may not be applied. And incremental ways is more
safety, I think. (Probably, we need to address the difference of vfs
and umsdos)

I thought that the patches of only bug fix is probably easy to be
applied.
Thanks.
