Can you try to backout those two patches in order before compiling?

I also cannot boot 2.4.10pre2aa2 on my alpha box :(, I nailed it down
due the mmap-rb vma lookup rewrite, however it is quite strange that it
is generating problems because it's at 99% common code stuff. I will try
to fix it ASAP. In the meantime make sure to backout those two patches
when you run it on alpha (such two patches never generated a single
problem on x86 yet AFIK).
