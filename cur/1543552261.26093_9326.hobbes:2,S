Exec.library with it's aproximately 6kb can hardly be compared with a
full featured kernel like Linux.  Look at something like filesystems.
If you write a multithreaded filesystem for the Amiga you'll hit alot
of complexity which you'll never have to think about for a monolithic
kernel.  Makes monolithic kernels look sweet as sugar in comparison.
