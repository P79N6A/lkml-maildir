I don't think it's ACPI to blame. The ACPI-related changesets applied
between 2.5.73 and 2.5.74 don't look like the culprit. Also, since it
continues to happen when acpi=off that also points away from ACPI.
I have other reports of things breaking in the same timeframe so I think
it's fair to say that something has regressed...somewhere.
