OOops - it turns out I also changed CONFIG_SBPCD=y to CONFIG_SBPCD=m
and I had an append="sbpcd=0x630" in my /etc/lilo.conf -- the sbpcd
driver now requires two paremeters and the kernel will hang during
boot if it does not get them, recompiling sbpcd into the kernel and
changing my /etc/lilo.conf to append="sbpcd=0x630,0" made everything
work.  My apologies if anyone wasted any time on my faulty
recollection.  
If we are not to make the kernel (or sbpcd) more forgiving about
outdated append lines, would it not be wise to mention this in
Documentation/Changes?
Anyway it works great, now to go back and put all the
config choices the way I wanted them :-).
