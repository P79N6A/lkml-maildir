Hi Andre,
> I am building ide.2.2.12.19991001.patch now.
I got the ide.2.2.12.19991001.patch and gave it a try.  However, I noticed
that the ide.c spinlock patch isn't included in this one (ie it isn't in
10-01, but it is 9-30).  So the stock 10-01 is back to crashing for me.  but
if I apply the ide.c patch, all works well.
Tom
