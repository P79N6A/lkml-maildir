AFAIK, load is not strictly a function of CPU usage - it's actually the amount of processes that have to 
wait for time on a CPU (??) and can be directly influenced by various other stuff like IRQs, disk usage, 
peripheral load etc... so you might want to look at something more informative - like vmstat
