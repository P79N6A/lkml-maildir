Last I heard Posix had not standardised writev/readv as of posix.1g. If
they remain unstandardised, then we get to do whatever is convenient (to
us) with them. If they standardise them differently from what we do,
THEN we should seriously think about changing...but unless/until they're
set in Posix stone one way or the other, I wouldn't go about altering
their behaviour.
Anyone got a Posix spec handy?
