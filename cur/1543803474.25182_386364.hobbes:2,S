Hi,
First off, I'm not on the list, so please CC me on any replies.
I believe I have found a bug in the IDE code of both the 2.4 and 2.6 
kernels. Here is a snippet from 2.4.32 starting from line 277 of 
drivers/ide/ide-io.c:
if (drive->select.b.lba &&
                     (hwif->INB(IDE_COMMAND_REG) == WIN_SPECIFY))
                     /* some newer drives don't
                      * support WIN_SPECIFY
                      */
                     return ide_stopped;
This code is attempting to ignore IDE errors if they were a result of the 
WIN_SPECIFY command, but the IDE_COMMAND_REG is a write only register, if 
it is read, IDE_STATUS_REG is read instead. Could someone confirm that 
this is in fact a bug and not something I'm missing? Almost identical code 
is also found in 2.6 kernels.
I think the best way to fix this would be to ignore the error in 
set_geometry_intr() in ide-taskfile.c instead of in ide_error() as seen 
above.
