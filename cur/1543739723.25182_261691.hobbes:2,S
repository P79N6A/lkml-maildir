Hi All,
I have a doubt about allocating the DMA memory using kmalloc OR
__get_dma_pages OR pci_alloc_consistent. I was unable to allocate the
memory greater than 1 MB using any one of the above memory functions. 
Is there any other method which will allocate the DMA memory greater
than 1 MB?
My system configuration is: Red Hat 7.3 with 2.4.18-3 kernel version on
IA32 platform. 
Thanks and regards,
Srinivas G
