Note, in case this wasn't clear already: in this case, the "MCE flag" is 
just a lazy flag saying "you need to check more deeply". It wouldn't cause 
false positives, simply because the _real_ check ends up being 
"read_pcix_error()" actually reading the error status from the bridge or 
the device.
It's just that 99% of the time, you don't want to do even that.
