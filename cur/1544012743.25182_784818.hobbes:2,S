there are a number of options here.
init can look for error exit codes and respawn things that died with 
errors.
init can be taught what normal behavior is for different daemons (some 
sort of configuration options)
init can look for cases where all children have exited.
init could do monitoring of aplications, and if an application is deemed 
'sick' can make sure that it kills all processes associated with that 
application before trying to respawn it. (this is much more then what init 
has doesn historicly, and may not be a good idea for the general case, but 
it is still a possibility that will make sense in some cases)
I'm sure that there are other things that can be done with such a 
mechansims, this is just what I can think of off the top of my head

wouldn't that require init to pay attention to every fork in the system to 
find the ones that it cares about?
also, an earlier post gave one reason for wanting to use signals being to 
eliminate race conditions.
