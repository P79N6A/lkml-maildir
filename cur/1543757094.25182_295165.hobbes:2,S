I posted a (not-consolidated) sys32_waitid to the MIPS list on Sunday.
The syscall tables should confuse you :-)  N32 needs to use compat
versions of most structures, but not siginfo_t.  O32 needs to use
compat versions of everything.  Your new version can replace the
sys32_waitid from my patch, but not sysn32_waitid.
Ralf, I'll let you sort it out :-)
