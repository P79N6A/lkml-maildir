I don't see how that relates. The DSDT needs to be loaded even before
driver initialization begins. Things like qlogic can over come this by
being compiled as modules, and letting initramfs-tools take care of
things.
That's not the case for DSDT loading. I'm not saying this patch is the
epitome of good coding, just that it's a needed feature.
If there's a better way to do it, I'm volunteering to do the grunt work,
but I haven't heard of any alternatives to this solution.
