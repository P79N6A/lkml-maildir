That has nothing to do with optimising the syscall path, or avoiding the
kernel/user transition.
Optimising user-space gettimeofday() is worth a little attention because
a lot of select-loop based apps call it before and after each select().
Any program that's doing lots of calculations with a timer-driven
progress meter may also use it.  Though timer signals can be used
instead.
Select loops also often do signal mask things -- are they worth the same
attention as gettimeofday()?
