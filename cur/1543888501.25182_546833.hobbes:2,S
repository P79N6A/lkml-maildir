The moduleinfo.h file looks redundant at first look.
Why not push relevant parts from moduleparam.h (the
MODULE_INFO bits) to module.h and let go of
the include of moduleparam.h in module.h (when you
have fixed the users)?
In this way we do not add an extra .h file.
And files that needs moduleparam.h will anyway always need module.h.
But not the other way around.
