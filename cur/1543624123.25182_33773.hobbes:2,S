Hi,
it looks like the change to pci_iommu.c in 2.4.18 breaks busmaster DMA for
alpha. The reason is that ISA_DMA_MASK is now 0xffffffff instead of
0x00ffffff as it was before. So the allocated memory is no longer
reachable from the ISA card.
I had to revert this change to make my ISA token ring card (tms380 based)
work again on alpha.
Cheers,
Jochen
