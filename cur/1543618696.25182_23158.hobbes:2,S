I think it is being suggested by whomever the proponent of the bool type
is (I lost track of who wanted it) that maybe keywords that depend on
boolean evaluations (if, while, for, etc.) should only take boolean
expressions as 'parameters', rather than what C does, which is take just
about any expression (everything except automatically allocated structs
being more or less reducible to an int).  This would certainly eliminate
some common typos (typos that any experienced C programmer knows ot look
out for) and make some other code a little more verbose (read: redundant).
So in the strlen example:
int strlen (const char *str)
{
	const char *cur;
	for (cur = str; *cur; cur++);
	return cur - str;
}
It would not be sufficient to check on *cur being true in the for loop,
but you would need an actual boolean expression or boolean type (*cur == 0
or somesuch).
This is a definite change to the C language and while I can see the
benefits of it, I am not sure if it's worth the trouble to alter a
compiler to enforce this type of thing, etc.  :)
