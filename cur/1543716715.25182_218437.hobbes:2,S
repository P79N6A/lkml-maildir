Much like coda already does IIRC - kernel wakes userspace blocking on a
read to your special device, userspace 'writes' result back to special
device. This was an idea for a generic userspace upcall mechanism
originated by Alan Cox with his psdev circa 2.0/2.2 ?? which formed the
basis of the coda filesystem which does close to what you would want.
I've written a userspace block device driver interface using this
mechanism also (unpublished as of today, not wanting to compete with
nbd and enbd - it is unlike enbd which blocks on an ioctl and far
far simpler.

This way to do zero-copy by using mmap on your special device
(which I plan to do for my userspace block device interface).
