I have to admit that I wasnae aware of that option - by the looks of
it, actually a large collection of options...

I've just checked my RedHat 5.2 based system, which I understand to be
glibc based, and get the following:
 Q> /etc/localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/GB
 Q> /usr/lib/zoneinfo does not exist
 Q> /usr/share/zoneinfo/localtime -> /etc/localtime
Does that help?
Best wishes from Riley.
