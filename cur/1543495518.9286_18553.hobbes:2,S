Well, even if I try to ignore this bit in Linux, I can't access that
memory area.
I've tried changing cyzload (a userspace program that loads the
Cyclades-Z FPGA and its firmware by accessing its memory-mapped space) to
read the address in "I/O at" instead of in "memory at" from /proc/pci (as
this address already has the bit 0 masked, and it's supposely the correct 
one, as NT allocates the same address), but I'm still _NOT_ able to write
to that memory area (I get an error on the program saying that it was not 
able to configure the Cyclades-Ze FPGA).

In the light of the aforementioned fact, I don't this would help.
Do you have any other suggestions ?! I'm starting to run out of options 
... :(
