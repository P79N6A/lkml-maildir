I've never seen this on 2.4.19-rc3 and I've been beating on it pretty
hard, running dbench 128 many times.  However, 2.5 is another story.
This might not be the best thread to report this, but since the subject 
came up, I'm getting the following message with recent 2.5.x kernels
whenever I run relatively large numbers of dbench clients.  
Buffer I/O error on device sd(8,8), logical block XXXXXXX
where logical block repeats 0-6 times.  This behavior is repeatable, but
only occurs under fairly high load.  I ran dbench with increasing numbers
of clients, with the following results:
dbench clients	Buffer I/O error messages
>=48		0
52		1
56		0
64		0
80		11
96		9
112		7
128		4
This particular run was with 2.5.29 with rmap13b and slabLRU patches, but the behavior with 2.5.29-vanilla was similar.  Kernel is SMP, no preempt,
and /dev/sda8 where dbench was running was mounted ext2.
The test box is 2-way p3, SCSI, 1GB memory.
Time to go beat on -rc5 and see if anything falls out.
