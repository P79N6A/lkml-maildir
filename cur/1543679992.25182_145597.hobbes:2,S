Maybe we are just working under different assumptions, so let me
explain my background a little.
Two of the reasons, why open source works well, are frequent releases
and lots of feedback.  In the embedded world, a typical number of
releases is one and a typical amount of feedback is none.  So you
either create a perfect product or you arrange for feedback yourself.
Without any user interaction tools around, the best feedback you can
get is a core dump plus maybe some information from /proc.  Remember
the borken patch for ppc I sent to you?  We didn't get a core dump and
people were quite unhappy, so the investigation began.
In the course of the investigation, I found another spot, where we
didn't get a core dump, which started this whole thread.  Guess what,
people aren't happy either.  One workaround would be to never use the
signal stack, but if this can be fixed properly, I would see more
happy faces at work.  And I like happy faces.

There is an open source web server that, combined with a closed source
library, fscks up your stack pointer.  I don't know how they did it
and I don't even care.  What I do care about is that it happened, that
it can happen again any time, and that we handle this problem as
gracefully as possible.  A core dump is graceful, a do_exit(SIGSEGV),
as it was in the ppc code is not, and an inifite loop is anything but
graceful.
I agree that my initial patch can cause other problems, but the
problem itself should still get fixed.
