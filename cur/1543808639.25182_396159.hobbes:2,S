sysfs, actually.
The patches look reasonable from a quick scan.  A few little things:
- The ringbuffer head and tail indexes are atomic_t's, but always seem to
  be manipulated inside the lock.  Perhaps they can become integers.
- You did the ringbuffer the wrong way.  Don't constrain the head and
  tail to be within 0..MAX_EVENTS.  Instead, just let them wrap right up to
  0xffffffff.   Apply the masking when you actually _use_ them.
  That way, empty is (head == tail) and full is (tail - head == MAX_EVENTS).
- Could use kstrdup() in a few places.
- A few unneeded casts of void*'s, but everyone does that.
- There are a lot of global symbols in there.  Perhaps they don't all
  need to be global.
