The Single Unix Specification says:
   "If the pathname refers to a directory, it may also have one or more
    trailing slashes."
and:
   "If a symbolic link (see symbolic link ) is encountered during pathname
    resolution, then pathname resolution is complete if all of the following
    are true:" 
              This is the last component of the pathname. 
              The pathname has no trailing slash. 
              The function is required to act on the symbolic link itself, or
              certain arguments direct that the function act on the symbolic
              link itself."
The following shows that Linux adheres to this specification:
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$ mkdir foo
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$ ls foo/
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$ ln -s foo bar
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$ touch foo/bash
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$ ls bar
bash
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$ ls bar/
bash
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$ ls foo/bash/
ls: foo/bash/: Not a directory
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$ ls -l bar/
total 0
-rw-r--r--   1 eastep   loc551          0 Dec 15 08:56 bash
[eastep@eastep-1 test]$
Note that "ls bar/" is acceptable since the (resolved) pathname does refer to
a directory (foo). Also, "ls -l" uses lstat(2) which is required to act on the
symbolic link itself; since there was a trailing slash, it acted on the
referent of the link (foo).
