Looks like the card reader is part of the PC Card chip. I have a similar
setup om my laptop. I never managed to get it working. But maybe things
changed and newer PC Card brigdes have a card reader which act as a USB
device. I have a Ricoh controller on my laptop:
00:09.0 CardBus bridge: Ricoh Co Ltfd RL5c476 II (rev 88)
00:09.1 CardBus bridge: Ricoh Co Ltfd RL5c476 II (rev 88)
00:09.2 System peripheral: Ricoh Co Ltd: Unknown device 0576 (SD Card
reader?)
