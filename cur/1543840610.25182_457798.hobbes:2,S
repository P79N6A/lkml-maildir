Subject: [patch 0/1] Relative atime

There was enough interest in the relative atime patches that I went
ahead and implemented support in the mount command as well, and
cleaned up the patches for inclusion.  Relative atime only updates the
atime if the previous atime is older than the mtime or ctime.  It's
like noatime, but useful for applications like mutt that need to know
whether a file has been read since it was last modified.
