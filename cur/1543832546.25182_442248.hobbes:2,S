No, I'm talking about freezes without anything printed.
As soon as anything is printed, it becomes easier.

If the user doesn't notice what is written into his logs, the solution 
is to change this (e.g. via logcheck).
And if the user doesn't care, there's no reason for getting the bug 
report - a bug report from a not responsive user is worse than no bug 
report.

I'm still sure the important points are
- developer manpower and
- responsive bug submitters,
and your proposal doesn't help with any of these.
But this is open source, so feel free to send a patch implementing your 
ideas and prove me wrong.
