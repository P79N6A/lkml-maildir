Well, I just took one of your calculated probabilities as something
you have really observed - (*) below.
"The probabilities for the 3 split possibilities for random allocation are:
       2/2 (the desired outcome) is 3/8 likely,
       1/3 is 4/8 likely, and
       0/4 is 1/8 likely.            <-------------------------- (*)

Yes. That said, idle_balance() is out of work in this case.

I wonder what would happen if X gets reniced to -10 instead (and
spinners are at 0).. I guess, something I described in my previous
mail (and dubbed "unlikely cospiracy" :) could happen, i.e. 0/4 and
then idle_balance() comes into play..
ok, I see. You have probably achieved a similar effect with the
spinners being reniced to 10 (but here both "X" and "top" gain
additional "weight" wrt the load balancing).

Hum.. the "every 60 seconds" part puzzles me quite a bit. Looking at
the run_rebalance_domain(), I'd say that it's normally overwritten by
the following code
               if (time_after(next_balance, sd->last_balance + interval))
                        next_balance = sd->last_balance + interval;
the "interval" seems to be *normally* shorter than "60*HZ" (according
to the default params in topology.h).. moreover, in case of the CFS
                if (interval > HZ*NR_CPUS/10)
                        interval = HZ*NR_CPUS/10;
so it can't be > 0.2 HZ in your case (== once in 200 ms at max with
HZ=1000).. am I missing something? TIA
