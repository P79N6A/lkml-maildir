Stop distributing the drivers outside of the kernel?

This has absolutely zero chance to happen, as the evolution of the
kernel has proven time and again.  The internal APIs of the kernel
aren't stable, however much we'd like them to be, because the best way
to do something at time t isn't the best way to do it at time t+1.
The best that is done is to try to change the drivers at the time the
core changes, and that only happens if the source of the drivers is
there along with the rest of the kernel.
