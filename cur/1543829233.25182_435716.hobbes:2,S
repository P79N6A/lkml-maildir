Controversial indeed.  Just because Christoph tentatively puts forward
such a patch is no reason to include it in your dirty page series.
Probably my fault for drawing attention to the ill-defined relationship
between update_mmu_cache and more recently added lazy_mmu_prot_update,
and wondering aloud on what's different between do_wp_page and mprotect.
If you want to pursue this patch, you should address it to someone
experienced in update_mmu_cache, someone familiar with those
architectures which implement it: ideally to Dave Miller (CCed),
who designed and wrote most of Documentation/cachetlb.txt.
The answer I expect is that update_mmu_cache is essential there in
do_wp_page (reuse case) and handle_pte_fault, on at least some if
not all of those arches which implement it.  That without those
lines, they'll fault and refault endlessly, since the "MMU cache"
has not been updated with the write permission.
But omitted from mprotect, since that's dealing with a batch of
pages, perhaps none of which will be faulted in the near future:
a waste of resources to update for all those entries.
But now I wonder, why does do_wp_page reuse case flush_cache_page?
