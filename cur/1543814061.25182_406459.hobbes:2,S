Mysql people are strange. For example, their daemon does not want to die
on SIGTERM, this makes it harder to run it under daemontools.
Also it drops privileges BEFORE it opens logfiles (--log=xxx).
I cannot get it to log stuff on stderr:
echo "* Starting mysqld"
env - \
setuidgid root \
mysqld \
    --defaults-file="$PWD/my.cnf" \
    --user="$user" \
    --datadir="$var/data" \
    --tmpdir="$var/tmp" \
    --socket="$PWD/mysql.socket" \
    --pid-file="$PWD/mysql.pid" \
    --skip-name-resolve \
    --skip-innodb \
    --skip-ndbcluster \
    --skip-networking \
    --log=/proc/self/fd/2 \
    --log-slow-queries=/proc/self/fd/2 \
Those last two options don't work:
mysqld: File '/proc/self/fd/2' not found (Errcode: 13)
Oh well....
