Subject: build failure; CONFIG_HZ* unset if power management is not selected (2.6.12-rc5-mm1)

I just did a "make randconfig" in 2.6.12-rc5-mm1 to see if it would turn 
up some unexpected failures - and indeed it did. The randomly generated 
config didn't set CONFIG_PM and that in turn resulted in none of 
CONFIG_HZ, CONFIG_HZ_100, CONFIG_HZ_250 or CONFIG_HZ_1000 being set 
either. This resultes in the following spectacular build failure :
