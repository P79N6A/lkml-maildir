Not really.  Yes, it runs on different operating systems.  But to send
the SCSI commands to the device you have OS-specific code in there,
simply because it's handled in different ways on Solaris / Linux /
whatever OS.  You could make the device addressing OS-specific as well
instead of expecting everyone in the world follow the Solaris model,
that would make life a bit easier for everyone involved.
Addressing IDE devices (try to get a real SCSI burner these days)
using scsi host+target+lun is sort-of silly IMHO ...
