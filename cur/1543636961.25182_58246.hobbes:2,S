Subject: FS problems with a7v266-e-Promise + UDMA + Raid 1 + ReiserFS when using USB or Sound (K 2.4.18)

Hello.
I've been bitten by the following problem:
Im using an A7V266-E with an onboard promise contoller.
Ontop of that I use Linux-md in Raid 1 mode on the two Promise channels, 
usually with UDMA activated. My root filesystem is ReiserFS on md0. This 
worked fine for quite a while, however last month I tried to use the 
alsa-cmipci driver with the onboard sound, I got a crash and such 
terrible corruption that I decided to reinstall.
Now I've tried activating USB, which appears to be using IRQ 5 as do the 
two promise ports. The system crashed and when it came back up, my 
filesystem was warped from July to May, all newer files were lost.
Oh: To be able to boot the System, I've had to enable the promise bios, 
but did not activate raid there.
Any coments would be very appreciated. I'd be happy to provide more 
details, but it might be a couple of days to find out.
CC to me would be much appreciated.
Regards
Thomas
