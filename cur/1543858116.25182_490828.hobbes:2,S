> Good catch on the inlining. I had meant to do that and missed it.
Er... if you want it to *be* inlined, you have to put it into the .h
file so the compiler knows about it at the call site.  "static inline"
tells gcc not avoid emitting a callable version.
Something like this the following.  (You'll also need to add
a "#include <stdbool.h>", unless you expand the "bool", "false" and
"true" macros to their values "_Bool", "0" and "1" by hand.)
