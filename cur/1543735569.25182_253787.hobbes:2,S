Because rtl8169_init_ring() is called before rtl8169_hw_start() in 
rtl8169_open().  init_ring allocates the recieve buffers, and I'm 
assuming that r8169_alloc_rx_skb() can get >32 bits.

I was looking at 2.6.9-rc2-mm1, which has (pardon hideous line wrapping):
	if ((sizeof(dma_addr_t) > 4) && !pci_set_dma_mask(pdev, DMA_64BIT_MASK)) {
		tp->cp_cmd |= PCIDAC;
		dev->features |= NETIF_F_HIGHDMA;
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	} else {
		rc = pci_set_dma_mask(pdev, DMA_32BIT_MASK);
		if (rc < 0) {
			printk(KERN_ERR PFX "DMA configuration failed.\n");
			goto err_out_free_res;
		}
	}
But I have 512MB RAM, so this probably isn't a problem for me.  I'm 
running x86_64, BTW.

Will this be ready for 2.6.9?  Otherwise it would probably be better to 
just disable DAC so the driver keeps working.
On an unrelated note, I just took a look at the PHY timer code.  It 
looks like the PHY timer will never reactivate once it shuts off, which 
means that the resetting is completely deterministic and the printk 
conveys no useful information.  Can we just delete it (patch attached -- 
this computer mangles them)?
What does it do, anyway?  If it is necessary for someone's card (not 
mine) to acquire a gigabit link (which is what it seemed to do in old 
versions of the driver), then we're _still_ broken for the case where 
they drop the link and try to reacquire it.  Would it make sense to 
remove the reset_enable stuff in -mm for awhile and see if anyone complains?
