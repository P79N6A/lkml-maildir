+          When Y this option provides accounting and allows to configure
+          limits for user's consumption of exhaustible system resources.
+          The most important resource controlled by this patch is unswappable 
+          memory (either mlock'ed or used by internal kernel structures and 
+          buffers). The main goal of this patch is to protect processes
+          from running short of important resources because of an accidental
+          misbehavior of processes or malicious activity aiming to ``kill'' 
+          the system. It's worth to mention that resource limits configured 
+          by setrlimit(2) do not give an acceptable level of protection 
+          because they cover only small fraction of resources and work on a 
+          per-process basis.  Per-process accounting doesn't prevent malicious
+          users from spawning a lot of resource-consuming processes.
