here's a cleaner patch i came up with flying back from san jose.  it's
against 2.3.10, but should apply to 2.3.1[23] without much fiddling.
essentially it's the same as what i described yesterday, but there's some
additional clean-up and extra comments that go along with the deletion of
redundant code.  i've been testing a more complicated variant of this for
a few weeks, and haven't seen any trouble with it.
Steve, can you try this out and let me know if it helps?
