Ah, the stack. Yes, I think that will work. You see, the functions that 
need this test
always take a pointer to a struct that holds all the thread info called 
'mon'. That info is the pid of the
thread , the ptr to the stack mmap'd and the size of the stack, I think 
I can change the test to:
{
   int32_t
     stackvar;
    /* if address of the stackvar is OUTSIDE the stack of handler 
thread, then
         you are not running this function from the handler thread */
   if ( &stackvar < mon->handler_q.thread->stack ||
         &stackvar > mon->handler_q.thread->stack + 
mon->handler_q.thread->stacksize - 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "bad, bad, bad!\n");
        exit(-1);
    }
}
Would that work? If so, that is nice because no syscall.
