patch -l does not imply cleanly. That will ignore the whitespace munging 
that your MUA is doing.

They should use snprintf. Thanks for pointing that out.

Yes. We talked about doing that from the very beginning, and were going to 
see how things worked out. There was some dicussion about this at OLS, 
too. But, I'm not sure it's ready for it yet.
What would be nice would be some way to cleanly represent conditional 
attributes of devices, like resource and power management. I think I 
almost have something with the device interface stuff, but I fear it's a 
fine line to cross over into Abstraction Hell...
