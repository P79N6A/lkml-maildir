Wow.  Insane.  So these all declare the same type:
__attribute__((foo)) T *v;
T __attribute__((foo)) *v;
T *__attribute__((foo)) v;
?  Specifically, they point to a foo-T, for convenient shooting?

context also represents a qualifier; the position of the qualifier should
determine things like whether you want to enforce the context when you access
a pointer or dereference a pointer.

Definitely not an option.

Something like that sounds vaguely reasonable.  It should allow the same set
of attributes, and just change what they apply to.  To use your example,
T __qualifier__((foo)) *v;
and
T (__attribute__((foo)) *v);
would mean the same thing.

Agreed.  Not an option, even if we *could* implement it.
