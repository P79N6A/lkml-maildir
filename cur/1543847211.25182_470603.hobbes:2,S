Well it all applies on top of the hrtimer/dynticks stuff with only a bit of
fixing needed.  And then it compiles.
But there's been so much time-related work happening lately that I'm
inclined to park this work for a while, give the existing changes time to
settle in and get debugged.  And to give people time to review this new
material.  If that review is positive, we can bring this material into
-mm in a week or so.  OK?
