This is a multi-part answer.  Say, 5 parts.
a.  If someone won't read the help text, how can we help them?
b.  If we make a 2 GB log buffer size a compile-time error, will
they read that?
c.  If we make it a compile-time warning, will they read that?
d.  What limit(s) do you suggest?  I can try to add some limits.
e.  This kind of config limiting should be done in the config system IMO.
I've asked Roman for that capability....
