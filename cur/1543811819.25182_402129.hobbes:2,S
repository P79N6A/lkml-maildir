counter.li.org is a great project and I'm registered there too since a few 
years. But it has not such detailed statistics over the used hardware. 
Sure, it has statistics, but not such detailed some.
And there are several other features on LiSt which I'm missing on 
counter.li.org. For example the hardware-database in which every user can 
vote and comment his own hardware and others can search for hardware to 
find out which is best supported under linux.
Or the "position locator", the maps on which you can see how the 
distribution of linux is on the whole world. Sure, there are not very many 
systems registered (just only three in germany), but this will hopefully 
grow fast. ;)
