I'd be interested to know more about the IO disconnect support.  Do
you have any pointers on what interfaces are exposed to trigger such
an event?
The problem I'd like to solve is this:
A mounted blockdevice is considered "bad".  Given the device is "bad"
I don't care about flushing any outstanding IO.  I'd like the ability
to purge that blockdevice from the system; dropping all IOs on the
floor.  This would have to include invalidating inodes and more no?
Ultimately the superblock would need to be released too right?  Would
this happen for free with IO disconnect?
Does IO disconnect reliably and cleanly sever all associations a
mounted blockdevice has with Linux?
