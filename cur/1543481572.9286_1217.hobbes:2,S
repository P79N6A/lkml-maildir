Because the VESA framebuffer uses the VESA 2.0 BIOS, it can only be
called from real mode.  Therefore, it must be done at boot time, before
the kernel enters protected mode.  This means that it cannot be compiled
as a module (unless somebody wants to hack vm86 support so that it can
be used _inside_ the kernel).

VesaFB only is activated if you pass a vga= value which corresponds to a
graphics mode.  If it is a text mode, vgacon is still used (or another
framebuffer).
