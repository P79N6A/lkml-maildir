Hi Greg:
The following are four patchsets for 2.6 which were either direct
from or inspired by recent updates in the lm_sensors CVS.
These patches should be applied, in order, on top of your -test11
megapatch [1].  Please queue these up for inclusion after 2.6.0.
LKML: please CC me on comments, thanks
