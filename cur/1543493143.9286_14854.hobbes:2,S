now that you mention it i started having sporadic fork errors on 2.2
I'll get a fork: Try again when restarting a web server process. And
sometimes when i run my web log analyzer i'll get fork: Try again. Maybe,
oh, once every 2 days or so.
right now i'm running 2.2.5 with openlinux 1.1, 256 RAM. Netscape
fasttrack webserver.
