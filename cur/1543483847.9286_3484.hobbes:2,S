No.

This can't work, because the partition selection done by 4 bits of the minor
number only allows 16 values:
1 for the disk as a total and 15 for the partitions.

You can use my Logical Volume Manager <
http://linux.msede.com/lvm>
 to
do the job.
It allows you to put your 36G Raid into one Volume Group (VG) and to configure
up 31 Logical Volumes (LVs) to put your filesystems or whatever into.
If 31 LVs is not sufficient for you, create 2 partitons, put them into
2 VGs and voila --> 62 LVs and so on.
O.k.: my proposal with 2 or more partitions is not absolute flexible any more
      but the LVM is limited to 8 bit minor numbers too 8*(
      You can have up to 8 VGs with up to 31 LVs each at this point in time.
BTW: you are able to resize VGs and LVs at runtime.
     For eg. add another 100G raid subsystem and extend the existing VG's
     capacity to a grand total of 136G.
     Afterwards you are able to grow the LV(s) 8*)

Heinz
