As I said: one of the main motivations for NFSv4 is WAN support, and
in those environments, strong authentication is a must.
That said, the plan is to also prepare a 'null' authentication scheme
for RPCSEC_GSS (basically using RPCSEC_GSS as a wrapper for AUTH_UNIX)
so that the strong auth can be provided as a simple plugin in case its
inclusion in the kernel would not be acceptable.
Cheers,
