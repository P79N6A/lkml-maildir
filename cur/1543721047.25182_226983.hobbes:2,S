Could you try to be more specific in what you expect to see in a .tar.gz'ed kernel.
A script that creates a .tar.gz from current kernel would be fine :-)
I expect something like:
All files stored in a directory named: kernel-2.6.6-rc4/
Includes all source files
Includes .config
Do you expect to see a fully build kernel?
- With all .o files
- With the output file (bzImage or whatever used by selected architecture)
Anything else?
