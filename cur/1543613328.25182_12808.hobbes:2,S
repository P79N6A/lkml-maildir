Then you make a block-device device-driver that extracts and uncompresses
each read from ROM/NVRAM upon demand. It pretends to write. The actual
data-storage device is still paged and it only writes to the caller's
buffer so it doesn't use any RAM for storage.
When writing the compressed NVRAM, one has to use only allocation-unit
sizes, which reduces the amount of compression possible. Basically,
if you have 2000 "blocks", you need to compress 2000 individual blocks
and keep an uncompressed list of each block offset somewhere. This
complication is one of the many reasons why the general solution
is to un-compress everything once into RAM on startup. 
There are many arguments, but I don't think power consumption is
one of them. Whatever they use for RAM on the palm machines allows
the machines to run a week on 4 'aa' -size batteries. Maybe they
grab kinetic energy from keystrokes using flea-generators ^;).
