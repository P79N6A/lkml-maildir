There will be a GPL'd layer, and it's likely that sysfs interaction will 
be on the GPL'd side anyway, for purely technical reasons.  But it does 
feel like circumvention of the limitations set in the kernel.  I thought 
it would be polite to ask the developers to lift those limitations, 
considering that they seem unfair and inconsistent with the stated 
purpose of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.
Sorry for using my gnu.org address.  I'll use my rajant.com address for 
further questions about that project.
