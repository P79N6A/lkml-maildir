which namespace do you want this in? The init one? or the one from the
user? (most traditional linux distributions only have one namespace, but
now that COW namespaces are merged I expect distros to start
experimenting with per user /tmp, or per-daemon data etc etc)
This is not a trivial thing... you need a "context" into which you can
ask that question (basically a process)
