Subject: 2.6.15-rc5-mm1 ext3 filesystem corruption

One of my 2.6.15-rc5-mm1 test boxes just crashed and caused filesystem 
corruption on its ext3 / filesystem.
The crash left these bits in syslog before automatically remounting the 
filesystem read-only and crashing the X server that was displaying the full 
message:
[<b01aa074>] __ext3_journal_stop+0x24/0x50
[<b01a3cf2>] ext3_delete_inode+0xb2/0x100
[<b01770c3>] dput+0x23/0x180
[<b017b022>] mntput_no_expire+0x22/0x90
[<b016fadf>] sys_link+0x2f/0x40
[<b0102e13>] sysenter_past_esp+0x54/0x75
The box was under relatively high load at the time this happened (compiling 
gcc 4.1.0 and OpenOffice.org 2.0.2rc1); the root filesystem is on a SATA disk 
(sata_via).
