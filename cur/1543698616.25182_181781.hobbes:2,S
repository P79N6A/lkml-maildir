Hello 
I would like to create a mask of usable IRQs for Linux to use. The
Boot-Prompt HowTo at:
   
http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO-4.html#ss4.4
says one can use pci=irqmask=mask at the lilo boot prompt (or
as an append in /etc/lilo.conf) to accomplish this task.
I have not been able to get this mask working for the 2.4.20
kernel. Can anyone help me reserve IRQs? 
I would usually do this through BIOS but unfortunately my Dell BIOS
does not provide the usual screen for doing so.
Thanks,
Daniel
