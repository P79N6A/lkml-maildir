Subject: [PATCH NG] alloc_pages_limit & pages_min
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
[Same patch as earlier sent to linux-mm, now tested]
Patch is agains 2.4.8-pre3, but should apply cleanly.
The only performance difference I have noticed is for copying
a huge file, then it performs a lot better (but I do not have a
baseline run for an unpatched -pre3, but I have benchmarked
both earlier and later revisions)
* The original code in __alloc_pages_limit has a little bug in
the case when:
- kreclaimd were not allowed to run for a LONG time...
Lots of kernel activity, RT tasks, or code running
around for a long time allocating memory.
- there were lots of inactive clean pages
- pages were allocated without direct_reclaim (higher order)
(networking might be one candidate)
it could result in using up ALL free pages!
This patch tries to prevent this situation in several ways:
1) Do not allow to alloc a free page when they are critically low.
   [last line of patch, the really critical part of this patch]
2) If direct reclaims are allowed do some additional work.
 reclaim & free until pages_min,
 alloc one page,
 reclaim and free until pages_low
