So, we still have to wait for the exact explanation...
Thanks very much Marcin!
I think, there is this one possible for your testing yet?:
Subject: [patch] genirq: temporary fix for level-triggered IRQ resend
Date: Wed, 8 Aug 2007 13:00:37 +0200
If it's not a great problem it would be interesting to try this with
different CONFIG_HZ too e.g. you could start with 100 (I guess, you
tested very similar thing in 2.6.23-rc2 with 1000(?) already).
Jean-Baptiste: you can skip/break testing of this 'experimental'
patch, too.
