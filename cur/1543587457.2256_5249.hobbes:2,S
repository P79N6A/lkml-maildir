Are you talking about IDE DMA problems on any VIA boards, or the Tyan in
particular?  I've sent several reports of sudden system death on a VIA
motherboard, that were confirmed by a few other people.  It's still
present in 2.2: Mandrake 7's installer froze, twice, until I added
"ide=nodma" (or whatever the option is).  Note, this is _without_ UDMA:
the board is not capable of UDMA.
