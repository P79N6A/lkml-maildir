I am talking about this code (in 2.6.11-rc2):
static void urb_unlink (struct urb *urb)
{
..............
	/* clear all state linking urb to this dev (and hcd) */
	spin_lock_irqsave (&hcd_data_lock, flags);
	list_del_init (&urb->urb_list);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore (&hcd_data_lock, flags);
	usb_put_dev (urb->dev);    <===== What is this, chopped liver?
}
void usb_hcd_giveback_urb (struct usb_hcd *hcd, struct urb *urb, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
	urb_unlink (urb);
	// NOTE:  a generic device/urb monitoring hook would go here.
....................
	/* pass ownership to the completion handler */
	urb->complete (urb, regs);
	atomic_dec (&urb->use_count);
	if (unlikely (urb->reject))
		wake_up (&usb_kill_urb_queue);
	usb_put_urb (urb);
}
Even if urb->dev was possible to dereference in the completion callback,
the hcd was not available.
But like I said, it's a moot point with explicit hooks.

I do not have plans to do that. In the network space, it's the difference
between BPF (and its spawn LPF), and, say DLPI tap or /dev/nit on SunOS.
By loading rules into kernel BSD programmers hoped to save a few cycles
by reducing the number of packets delivered to tcpdump. As far as I can
tell, nobody has a practical use for it, savings are miniscule...
I think some distros do not even configure LPF into kernels anymore.
However, nothing prevents you from adding another reader type to usbmon,
the one which does filtering. Heck, an ability to replace whole usbmon
is a design parameter. Rusty rewrote netfilter from scractch two times
(ipfwadm, ip-something-which-I-forgot, iptables). I don't think I can do
everything right with usbmon at first pass either. So I expect other
developers to try out ideas and experiment. Build your filter and prove
me wrong.
