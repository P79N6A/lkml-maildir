I have to admit that even after looking through include/linux/phy.h and
include/linux/mii.h, I don't have the faintest idea what values we can
expect to find in the "speed" field of phydev. The comment above struct
phy_device says that it is used "like in mii_if_info", but struct
mii_if_info doesn't have a "speed" field...
I'm willing to take your word for it, but some documentation would be
really nice...
