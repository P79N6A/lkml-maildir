But X problems have nothing to do with "privileged hardware access".
X problems are related to priority inversions between server and client
processes, and "one server process - many client processes" case.
I think syncronous nature of Xlib (clients cannot fire-and-forget
their commands to X server, with Xlib each command waits for ACK
from server) also add some amount of pain.
