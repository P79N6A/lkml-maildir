Hi,
I am seeing abnormal kernel<->userland interaction for range-exceeding 
offsets during readdir.
A suggested patch for btrfs is below, but I think there could also
be involvement of (read: a bug in) Glibc.
Would the copied parties please have a look, as it may spans both glibc 
and btrfs.
Thanks,
Jan

btrfs: readdir problem workaround for 32-bit off_t
Kernel is i586, as is the userland.
btrfs sets filp->f_pos == (2^63-1) when it has reached the
end of a directory. This is problematic.
In obtuse 32-bit mode (no _FILE_OFFSET_BITS), readdir(3) will not return 
the last entry.
However, when compiled with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, it will return the 
last entry. But telldir() will return (uint32_t)-1, which does not quite 
match up with the 2^63-1.
	$ cat test.c
	#include <dirent.h>
	#include <stdio.h>
	int main(int argc, const char **argv)
	{
		DIR *r = opendir(argv[1]);
		struct dirent *de;
		while ((de = readdir(r)) != NULL)
			printf("%lld %s\n", (long long)telldir(r), de->d_name);
		return 0;
	}
	$ gcc test.c -o test -ggdb3
	$ ./test /tmp/z
	2 .
	2 ..
	3 a
	4 b
	5 lib
	$ gcc test.c -o test -ggdb3 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
	$ ./test /tmp/z
	2 .
	2 ..
	3 a
	4 b
	5 lib
	4294967295 strace.log
This has deep effects and my boot hangs. (Got btrfs as the root fs.)
I have no idea who exactly of Glibc and btrfs is at fault with what,
but this change makes btrfs usable for the moment.
