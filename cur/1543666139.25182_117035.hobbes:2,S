No-one has responded to this email, so either no-one remembers this is 
people think someone else responded to my email ;-)
Does anyone remember this project. I checked the Linux kernel and it 
presently does not seem to have any support for this. Can anyone point me 
at references that will help me figure out how the kernel can make 
callbacks into a user land daemon?

I checked into this some more and it is clear that vm86() is only useable 
from userland code on Linux. However recently the FreeBSD kernels were 
modified to support vm86() from within the kernel, and in fact the latest 
FreeBSD VESA console driver uses the vm86() services so that it can do 
everything using the BIOS where necessary.
Is there any reason why the vm86() services in the Linux kernel cannot be 
used by other kernel code? Has anyone made an attempt to update the 
vm86() services to support this? 
Thanks!
