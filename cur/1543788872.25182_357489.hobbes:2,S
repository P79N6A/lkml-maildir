2.6.14-rc4-rt1 is up and running here. I'm starting without debug
disabled to look at whether I get xruns at all. It's been a while
since I've done that so I want to get a baseline. I'll do some latency
testing no matter what later this morning (a kernel recompile) to make
sure your fix for 64-bit processors is working.
I am seeing one strange thing in the 1394 area. dmesg didn't tell me
what device a newly mounted 1394 drive became. This makes it harder to
mount drives with partitions that cannot be labeled.

I believe it used to say after a mount that the partition became
/dev/sdb2, etc. This makes it harder to mount drives with partitions
that cannot be labeled. For mounted partitions I can find it in df:

Thanks. Everything else looks great so far.
Cheers,
Mark
