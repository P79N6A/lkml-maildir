Adrian,
Please have a look at my markers posts, especially:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0707.0/0669.html
And also look into OLS 2007 proceedings for Martin Bligh's paper on
Debugging Google sized clusters. It basically makes the case for adding
functionnality to debug _user space_ problems on production systems that
can be turned on dynamically.
