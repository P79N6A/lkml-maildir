I suspect the real reason here is that there's now so many ways to get
the processor ID that I cannot keep track of which one to use. Paul's
mention of __raw_get_cpu_var() just confuses me even more.
So if anyone can give me a conclusive answer of which one to use, I'm
happy to go there.
Granted I have a bias to avoid anything involving the preempt crap, but
thats just me :)
Cheers,
Jes
