Replying to Daniel Phillips:
Thanks for numbers, Daniel. Maybe it will impress them much.

I have almost complete kbuild25ified tree, 2.4.19-pre8-ac5 with addons, and
will make it available later today or earlier tomorrow.

It is IMO needed to add here:
- kb25 makefile.in syntax is much cleaner and don't require to contain
  extra crap, .in files are better maintainable for patch systems like
  netfilter p-o-m. and another one - $(c_to_o) definition allows us to
  reduce size of makefiles, and unnesessary handmerging of some patches.
- it is very stupid do appeal to codesize of Rules.make vs. kbuild25 core
  and discard kb25 based on this. Remember - efficient way is not always
  eq smaller code (one example is bubblesort vs. heapsort). Here, in fact,
  if we'll bloat Rules.make to 10k lines then we stuck due to make 
  stupidity^Wlimitations, but if we use 10k of C code to build a program 
  which (with many other things) give us ONE makefile of whole tree, we'll 
  gain here - we don't need to invoke make many times etc.
- it's not very efficient to try to improve rotten system when there is
  ready to use better replacement floating around
