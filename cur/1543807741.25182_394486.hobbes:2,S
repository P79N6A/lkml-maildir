GPL can establish terms for distribution of the original software, even if it 
goes unmodified. In other words, by distributing the GPL software, one must 
agree that all software being distributed at the same time linking to it are 
GPL-compatible. The GPL cannot prohibit you from distributing the linking 
software in this case, but it can prohibit distribution of the original 
software.

They would have force as conditions of distributing GPL software. If someone 
distributed software under the GPL, they would be accepting its terms and 
thus accepting that the GPL applies to all work they created. This example 
could be a bit extreme, however, and prohibited just on the grounds of being 
an invalidly-broad contract.

But it can prohibit distribution of work Z when work Y does not comply with 
the terms.

Linking is not mere aggregation.
