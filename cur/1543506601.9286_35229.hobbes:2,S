Drat, forgot a revision issue with the HOST-HOST, I can not remember
without my VIA notes and I am packing up stuff to move.
cat pci

Again, as I stated before, this is a puzzle with many of the pieces
missing and you have to imagine the rest to see what it is suppose to be.
Gad....don't you just love this chipset.
Yours is the first case based on all the docs that do not follow the
specs, should we be surprized........
