But still there's no one opinion about against what tree to base the
patch. For somebody it's Linus's mainline, for somebody it's bleeding
edge -mm. And there will be no one.
Thus, particular patch entry might have as -mm as Linus's re-based
versions or (as Adrian noted) VFS.asof02-07-2007 FANCYFS. For example,
Rusty did that, after somebody asked him to have not only -mm lguest
version. So, for really intrusive feature/patch (and not
in-middle-development, Adrian) author can have a version (with git
branch, patch directory or something).
Counter-example: Scheduler patches are extraordinary with large
threads or replies, but that is (one of) classical release-early and
often. Proposed bureaucracy doesn't apply ;)
