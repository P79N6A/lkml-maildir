one other thing to keep in mind on this entire discussion is that there
has not been a big incentive for the chip manufacturers to make a good
locking primitive (after all if 99% of the market is UP boxes why design
in extra stuff for the SMP modes)
This is changing as SMP boxes become mor popular.
has anyone pointed out this problem to the CPU vendors? it may be that
they would be interested in putting in some extra locking operations in a
future chip (for example I can easily see AMD implementing a 1
bit-per-lock set of locks that are arbatrated directly with the CPUs and
the chipset similar to the way cache coherancy works now rather then
the current model of useing a cacheline of memory that has to be moved
back and forth and then checked for status)
the big drawback would be that it would be non-standard commands which
each vendor would do differently, but the potential of implementing a
significant number of locks at the hardware level rather then just in
software is a very interesting thought.
