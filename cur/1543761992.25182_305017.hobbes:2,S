I can reproduce this behavior, but what I'm seeing is a little more
alarming than the data being written asynchronously.  After fsck replays
the journal, the xtree for the file is corrupt, which is why it appears
to contain zeros.  The syslog is showing that a corrupted xtree has been
found.  I am still investigating.

I'm getting similar results writing to a regular disk partition and
rebooting.

Confirmed.

test_creat is type void.

so is test_fsync
