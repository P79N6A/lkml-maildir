I'm not on the list, so my apologies if this is known.  I've checked
the archives and a rough search didn't pull anything up.  CCs of
replies to the list would be appreciated.
I'm seeing what looks like a spontaneous reboot, slightly reproducible
(ie, it's happened ~5 times, but I haven't been here when it's
happened, and when I tried to cause it, nothing happened) involving
decoding mp3 files to wav and then converting them to cdr format with
sox.
My configuration is at <URL:
http://www.psnw.com/~posterkid/config>,
I'm running a Cyrix 6x86 P133+ with 128meg EDO RAM, and didn't have
these problems under 2.0.x (haven't tested other 2.2.0-pre? kernels).
In a directory with many mp3s, running this command will eventually
cause a reboot with no OOPS or anything logged anywhere.
$ for i in `ls *.mp3 | cut -d. -f1`; do; mpeg2cdr $i.mp3 cdr/$i.cdr; done
I'm using zsh-3.0.5 as a shell.  
mpeg2cdr is the following shell script:
[cut]
#!/bin/sh
echo "n" | /usr/local/bin/l3dec -wav -fn 0 $1 /tmp/head.in >& /dev/null
/usr/local/bin/mkmp3head /tmp/head.in /tmp/head.out
/bin/rm -f /tmp/head.in
echo "n"|/usr/local/bin/l3dec -wav -sto $1 | cat /tmp/head.out - > /tmp/$$.wav
/bin/rm -f /tmp/head.out
sox -t auto /tmp/$$.wav -t cdr $2
/bin/rm -f /tmp/$$.wav
[cut]
l3dec is the Fraunhofer-IIS mp3 decoder, version 2.70.
sox is version 12.15.
I have been unable to narrow it down as to which particular part of
this script where this is happening.  
The files left over in /tmp cause EXT-2 errors upon trying to rm them,
I suppose this is due to them not being sync'd to disk prior to the
immediate reboot, which leads me to believe it may be happening during
l3dec (which is what writes the data to /tmp/NNNNN.wav).
More info:
I'm running the distributed.net RC5DES client (v2.7100.416) in the
background, nice'd to 19.
Sorry for the vague bug report, I know how useless they can be.
