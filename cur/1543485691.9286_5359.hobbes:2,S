		Hi John,
	ppp-2.3.5 is just a minor example of the real problem with 'compiling sources with redhat'.
It seems like it's kinda made for kiddies using rpm, I've encountered many difficulties trying to
compile many other packages ( remember the named 4.9.6 crisis ) named 4.9.7, gated,, gtk and glib,
diald, vim and so on. maybe in the nearest future they will *organize* the <include> structure
so we won't have to do it "by hand" :)
	I wonder why the linux kernel _still_ compiles under redhat :)
