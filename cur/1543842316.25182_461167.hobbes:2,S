Yes, either something like the plist patch for FUTEX_WAKE etc. or, if that
proves to be too slow for the usual case (non-RT threads), FIFO wakeup
initially and conversion to plist wakeup whenever first waiter with realtime
priority is added, is still needed.  That will cure e.g. non-PI
pthread_mutex_unlock and sem_post.  For pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast} we
need further kernel changes, so that the condvar's internal lock can be
always a PI lock.

Why?
POSIX doesn't forbid ENOTSUP in pthread_mutex_init to my knowledge.
