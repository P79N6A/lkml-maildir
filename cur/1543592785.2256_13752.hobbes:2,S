	I agree with you on the special case. I don't like it
either. Anyway, most patch to my drivers are applied wether I like it
or not, so I guess that I should be happy that I was notified and I
should sut up my big mouth because it won't make a difference.
	If I reject the patch now, I will be applied behind my
back. Been there, done that.
	In other words : yes, please apply the patch.
	Jean
