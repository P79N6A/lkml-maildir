You need the patch below (from Oleg Drokin) to fix this oops, but there
is also a problem with the code to finish deletes and truncates after a
crash, and that causes corruption. 
For now, I'd suggest commenting out both of the finish_unfinished()
calls in fs/reiserfs/super.c.  I've been working on the corruption for a
few days, it's really starting to irk me.  For now, I suggest commenting
out both of the finish_unfinished() in fs/reiserfs/super.c
