Ah.  dbench.   The change to balance_dirty_state() absolutely
cripples dbench throughput.  And that really doesn't matter,
unless you want to run dbench for a living.
You can get the dbench throughput back by increasing the
async and sync dirty buffer writeback thresholds:

Probably Noatun needs larger buffers if it is to survive concurrent
dbench.   You may see improvement with
	elvtune -b N /dev/hdaX
where 8 >= N >= 1.

dbench?  Throughput seems to scale with the fourth power of the
amount of RAM you chuck at it :)

Yes.  Readahead is fairly critical and there may be additional fixes
needed in this area.
Someone recently added the /proc/sys/vm/max_readahead (?) tunable.
Beware of this.  It only works for device drivers which do not
populate their own readhead table.  For IDE, it *looks* like
it works, but it doesn't.   For IDE, the only way to alter VM
readahead is via
	echo file_readahead:N > /proc/ide/ide0/hda/settings
where N is in kilobytes in 2.4.16 kernels.  In earlier kernels
it's kilopages (!).
