It's not <TAB> <SPC>, it's a copy from a text video memory buffer of an empty
portion of the screen. 07 is the attribute (=color), and 20 the <SPC> which
fills empty space. So this does not look like a buffer overflow, but a use of
a bad pointer somewhere. Perhaps a race during a text scroll or something ?
BTW, <TAB> is 9 :-)
Cheers,
Willy
