Does Linux support layered drivers ?
I want to write a driver that will take requests from
the applications and will pass them on to underlying
SD disk driver. For this I need to map open, close,
read, write, ioctl etc entry points to corresponding
functions of the underlying driver.
Pointer to any info would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Tom
