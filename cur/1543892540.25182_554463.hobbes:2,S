It is not at all nice.
1. it's incompatible ABI breakage
2. where will you put the key then, in the inode? :-)
Changing to "SYSVID%d" is no good either. Look, people
are ***parsing*** this stuff in /proc. The /proc filesystem
is not some random sandbox to be playing in.
Before you go messing with it, note that the device number
also matters. (it's per-boot dynamic, but that's OK)
That's how one knows that /SYSV00000000 is not just
a regular file; sadly these didn't get a non-/ prefix.
(and no you can't fix that now; it's way too late)
Next time you feel like breaking an ABI, mind putting
"LET'S BREAK AN ABI!" in the subject of your email?
BTW, I suspect this kind of thing also breaks:
a. fuser, lsof, and other resource usage display tools
b. various obscure emulators (similar to valgrind)
