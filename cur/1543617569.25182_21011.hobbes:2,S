Ahhhhh ok.
I think your workload (leaving a huge process inactive for
a few minutes, then switching desktops to that process)
really does need a special VM tuning knob.
I guess I'll add a knob like this to the -rmap VM.
I'll try to keep it a bit simpler than vm_max_mapped too,
it would seem it's possible to set vm_max_mapped so high
that the box will refuse swapping under any circumstance
and the box will just crash if you have too much RAM ;)))
(then again, root can always do this)
regards,
Rik
