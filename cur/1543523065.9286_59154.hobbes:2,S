That is the least of your worry. 1000 threads is 8Mb of kernel stacks, and 
enough switching of tasks to be sure you might as well turn most of your 
cache off. A computer is a state machine. Threads are for people who cant
program state machines.
There are plenty of cases Linux is most definitely not helping the situation
notably asynchronous block I/O.
