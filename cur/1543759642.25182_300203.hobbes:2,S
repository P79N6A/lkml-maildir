Eh, I got the event sequence wrong as usual, but the basic description
is right.
- Original SIGTRAP at breakpoint
- user says "cont"
- GDB tries to singlestep past the breakpoint - PTRACE_SINGLESTEP, no
  signal
- GDB receives SIGALRM at the same PC
- GDB tries to singlestep past the breakpoint - PTRACE_SINGLESTEP,
  SIGALRM
- GDB receives SIGTRAP at the first instruction of the handler
- GDB reinserts the breakpoint at line 18.  This is a "step-resume"
  breakpoint - we were stepping, we were interrupted by a signal.
- GDB issues PTRACE_CONT, no signal
- GDB receives SIGTRAP at the sigreturn location - this is the
  step-resume breakpoint.
- GDB remove that and issues PTRACE_SINGLESTEP, no signal - It
  is trying again to get past the breakpoint location so that it
  can honor the user's "cont" request.
- GDB receives SIGTRAP at the instruction after the breakpoint.
- GDB reinserts the original breakpoint and issues PTRACE_CONTINUE.
All of this is what's supposed to happen.  The executable be running
free now until it hits the breakpoint again.
- GDB receives an unexpected SIGTRAP at the next instruction (the
  second instruction after the original breakpoint).
If your compiler uses only two instructions for the loop, you might not
see this.  gcc -O0 will use three by default.  Just stick something
else in the loop.

If I'm following this right, then the saved value of eflags in the
signal handler should not contain the trap bit at this point.  It does,
though.  It's hard to see this in GDB, because the CFI does not express
%eflags, so "print $eflags" won't track up the stack.  I don't think
there's a handy dwarf register number for it at the moment.  But you
can print out the struct sigcontext by hand once you locate it on the
stack.
