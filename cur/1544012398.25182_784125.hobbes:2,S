hm, lockdep indeed has to do some non-trivial work - but is that really 
true of pure lockstat too? If you have a workload where you can see that 
it's heavy, you could do an NMI profile on x86 by running kerneltop on 
tip/master:
     
http://redhat.com/~mingo/perfcounters/kerneltop.c
You should get a top-alike list of the highest-cost functions. If lockstat 
is heavy, its activities should show up there.

no fundamental objections against your patch, but i think it needs a 
couple of cleanups first.
For example, this HAVE_TICKET_SPINLOCK distinction is unnecessarily 
exposed to the core kernel, why not just allow architectures to define 
spin_nr_contended():

> +#endif
and do something like this in spinlock.h to give a default definition:
#ifndef spin_nr_contended
# define spin_nr_contended(lock) (spin_is_contended(lock) ? 1 : 0)
#endif

those newlines you removed were there for a reason - they delimit blocks 
of code from each other and make return statements more visible.

please keep the local variable definitions in their original style, i.e. a 
reverse christmas tree:

do we need the ->isticketspinlock distinction? Cannot we call 
spin_nr_contended() for all spinlocks? (it's just that for ticket 
spinlocks we get a real value out of it - for normal spinlocks we only get 
0/1 out of it. But that is not a problem really.)
also, please rename 'hungry' to something more descriptive: for example 
'nr_contended' fits pretty well?
