Hi All.
There are a few problems with the matrox framebuffer, one of them was
mentioned on the list - it locks up the machine if you try to scroll up
(shift-pageup) while something is scrolling down.  I've noticed a few more, 
like garbled characters, and screen going blank if you switch to a console
running less, and press the up arrow.  I thought I could try to fix these,
but ran into a problem right away.  It is possible to compile the
framebuffer as a module, but I have no clue how it can be removed after
it's inserted - naturally, rmmod doesn't work as the module is being used
by all the consoles.  Is there a way to actually remove or reload it, and
if not, what's the point of having a framebuffer driver as a module?
