It's a 'feature' to use the primary IP of an interface unless you specify
otherwise.  Obtain the iproute2 package and use the tool 'ip' inside it.
for example:
ip route add 207.213.15.129 via 216.32.34.1 src 216.32.34.187 dev eth0 mtu
1500
specifies the destination, the gateway, and the source IP to use.
ip is the latest and greatest tools for you.  it can only be compared to
ifconfig/route in the likeness of a ball peen hammer to a laser chiselling
tool.
ip is good.  waste no time getting it.  the url for it and some sparse
examples relating to VPNs is available at
