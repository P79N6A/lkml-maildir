We already have this.  It's called xdm, kdm, or gdm.

Starting X sooner or later in the boot process won't make Linux any better
or worse than the competition.
What you are asking for is a distribution feature request, not a kernel
feature request.
You can get X to startup sooner by modifying your init scripts.  Just start
?dm after networking, and any other services that X will depend on.  Now you
can have any other services such as nfsd, samba, http, etc in parallel to X.
