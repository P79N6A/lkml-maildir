Hi all,
I am working on linux kernel tcp/ip optimization.
After doing some changes in my kernel, I am copiling
the kernel. While doing make xconfig, I have seleceted
some of known options and later as usual I have done
make dep;make bzdisk. 
The problem is while booting the kernel with my newly
developed floppy, I am getting the error message
kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:03
I donno what to do. Is it some thing related to "make
xconfig" options or some other thing. Please give me
suggestion.
Thanking you in advance
Murali.
