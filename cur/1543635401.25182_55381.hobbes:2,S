I've seen the same thing on my ATI XPert@Play (Rage Pro chipset).  At 
  2.4.17, it was a risky proposition to switch between X and a text VC.
  It's better in 2.4.18, although not much (I believe.  I may be wrong).
  I have happend upon a situation a number of times where, when switching
  from X to a text VC, the machine "locks up", but CTRL-F7 (the X VC) will
  get me back to a working X login screen (KDM), at least for a while.  If
  I keep trying to switch to a text VC (which never works), it eventually
  fully locks up, to the point where I have to pull the plug, since the on
  switch is non-responsive.  If I tell it to shut down, it gets *most* of
  the way through before carping out and locking up fully.
I don't *believe* I've seen this in 2.5.x, although I may be wrong.
