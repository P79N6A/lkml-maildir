I tried twice on IRQ 0, but never got the OOPS.  I tried on IRQ 3
(serial)
and never booted.  I tried on IRQ 1 but the keyboard appears hung and 
I never got the OOPS as well.  
I am now able to lockup my Dell on a regular bassis.  
The only information I have been able to get so far
was the addresses via the %eip:
CPU1:  c010ced0-4014 in do_IRQ (c010ce90)
CPU2:  c010a712-2c56 in ret_from_sys_ccall (c010a70c)
I am basically at a loss but am continueing my tests....
Could there be a problem between the ikd patch and the kdb patch?
Also, I am now using a serial console (ttyS1, 9600 baud).  
I am going to remake my kernel from make clean.... reinstall it,
use the default NMI of 0, etc.  
Any help or pointers would be appreciated!
