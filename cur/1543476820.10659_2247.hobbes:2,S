Yep, it's during bootup.  I recompiled with magic-sysrq enabled, and gave
it a try.  If I use Alt-SysRq-p right after it gives that "lp0: using
parport0 (polling)" message, it gives me this: 
EIP: 0010:[<c0108ae8>] EFLAGS: 00000246
EAX: 00000000 EBX: c02b6320 ECX: 0000000a EDX: c02b6320
ESI: 00000001 EDI: 0000000a EBP: c0003e48 DS: 0018 ES: 0018
CR0: 80050036 CR2: 00000000 CR3: 00101000
If I press any of the SysRq combinations after waiting for another second 
or so, none of them work at all (whether I've already used it once or
not). I'm something of a virgin at this, so I'm not sure what I need to do
with this above output... is there some documentation somewhere?  I assume
those numbers are meaningless without looking at other things (whatever
those may be :).
The parport messages I get on bootup are as follows:
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [SPP,PS2]
lp0: using parport0 (polling).
