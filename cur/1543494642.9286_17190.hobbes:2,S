Because the critisism is not specific. It he had said: SCSI implementation
in Linux sucks (it does), OK we would accept it and try to fix it.
Just saying it has a way to go may be true but doesn't help anyone.
I appreciate accepting critisism, but:
Just saying, hey let's work on it does not help anybody. Working on WHAT?
Linux has 11 MB gzipped source code!
Saying it's unreliable (and even more unreliable than W*n) is something very
strange, which has to be explained, before i can accept it. Compared to a HA
Unix cluster, Linux might be unreliable, yes, but ... 
I'd suggest sb to contact him and asking him
* where he sees the weak points in Linux
* what makes him think it's unreliable
THEN we could start to work on improving Linux wrt to his critisism.

He certainly know what he's talking about. But the statement on Linux in
this interview was not his main point but rather a side note and not made
with too much care. (I don't say without reasons or without knowledge,
please note that.)
Let's ask him for specific problems ...
