Ok, sorry about that.

I agree, so I replaced it with a comment.

Ok, but then any power of two larger than the cache line size should be
fine, assuming kmalloc() returns a properly aligned buffer.
Other than that, I can't see any reason why a platform with 64 byte
cache lines should need larger buffers than one with 32 byte cache
lines.

There are still issues with the DMA code that the PIO code doesn't
have. So I think it should be selectable until we can sort out the
error/break handling.
