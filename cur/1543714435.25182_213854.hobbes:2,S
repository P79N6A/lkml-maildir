This is a follow on to Ted Tso's patch which fixed up IOs of > 2G.
There seems to still be a problem with direct IO. 
(Ted's patch was:
#	           ChangeSet	1.1058.2.2 -> 1.1058.2.3
#	        mm/filemap.c	1.85    -> 1.86   
#	      fs/ext3/file.c	1.3     -> 1.4)
generic_file_direct_IO() takes a size_t count for the IO size, but then
assigns it to an int before checking for > chunk_size.  Also, progress
is rolled up in an (int) progress var.  These get garbled on ia64 for
example.
I think this patch takes care of these issues.
