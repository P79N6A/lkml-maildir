What do I get? His/her config file, or some other?
One can watch certain subsystems/drivers. That's a _really_ nice
feature, and I'd even like to be notified if a file belonging to one of
"my" choosen subsystems is to be changed on mainstream. However,
choosing subsystems of interest isn't quite fun because of the entrie's
order.
I'd do this with three parts (within one list):
ARCH - ALPHA
ARCH - SPARC
ARCH - ...
Then important subsystems:
FS-Core
INIT
NET
NET-IPv4
NET-IPv6
NET-xxx
PCI
SCSI
IDE
...
...and at last, I'd list all chooseable drivers:
3c509
cpuid
ACPI
APM
FS - AFS
FS - EXT2
FS - EXT3
FS - codepages
...
That would really ease finding the interesting parts. Where, for
example, can I go for sparc?
