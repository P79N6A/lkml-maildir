No Im taking it to mean virtual machine. In paticular VM on S/390 hardware.

No its what the S/390 VM is often called. Its a supervisor for supervisor
mode programs so illogically enough its a hypervisor 8). The IBM mainframe
guys thing this kind of set up is routine. Unix is met with 
'You mean you cant run a new kernel on test at the same time as the old
one' type remarks.

As I understamd it the VLIW code isnt accessible
