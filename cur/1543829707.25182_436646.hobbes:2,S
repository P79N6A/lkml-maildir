OK, it also depends on IO APIC being enabled and active, ie. noapic on
the kernel command line will fix it as well as disabling
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC. That doesn't help me at all to understand why it
happens though.
The only difference with IO APIC disabled seems to be that the irq
doesn't get ACKed before update_process_times() gets called.
And your "fix" makes it being called outside of the xtime_lock spinlock
and with a slightly different stack usage AFAICT.
But none of these should make a difference, right?
