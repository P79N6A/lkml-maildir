No.
I've used VMS, and error code number encoding is a total heap of crap.
If you can't translate the message based on the _message_, then don't
bother. I'm not adding codes for different errors, it becomes just an
unreadable mess, and adds _zero_ to stability or readability, and it's
horrible for maintenance - suddenly you need to worry about silly numbers
for anything you print out, so you stop printing stuff or you re-use codes
that don't make sense.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions. This is one of those "good 
intentions" things - it sounds like it's a nice helper thing, but it's 
nothing but a load of maintenance headaches and causes horrible printout 
headaches.
