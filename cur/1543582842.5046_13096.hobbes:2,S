I've been looking at various -ac patches for the last couple of 
weeks and have been wondering why only this piece of difference
still remains between Linus' 2.4.2 and Alan's -ac2.  All the other
diffs in i387.c from 2.4.1-ac2 seem to have been merged into Linus
tree at around 2.4.2-pre1.  Could anybody explain it for me please?
