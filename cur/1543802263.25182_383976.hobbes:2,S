Good point. External modules slipped my mind when I did this change.
We have today:
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 15
EXTRAVERSION =
EXTRAVERSION will soon become -rc1
No sane driver will check for more than VERISON, PATCHLEVEL, SUBLEVEL.
xfs for once only used VERSION, PATCHLEVEL.
googling a little gave lot's of very ugly examples how it can be done
using grep, perl etc. So there is a legitim need for the variable
anyway.
So I will re-export VERISON, PATCHLEVEL, SUBLEVEL.
