I'm talking about Real Suspend States (tm), not hibernation.
The systems in question tend to not support hibernation.
In particular:  system sleep states where IRQs work ... that's a
common way for non-x86 platforms to work.

On the systems I was looking at, that assumption seems equivalent to
what the latest MMC core is assuming.  (I think this came as part of
the rewrite/refactoring a while back.)  But since the assumptions aren't
documented as such, you could say all guesses are equal.  ;)

I'm more concerned with the undesirable removal of devices at suspend
time ... ones with mounted filesystems etc.
