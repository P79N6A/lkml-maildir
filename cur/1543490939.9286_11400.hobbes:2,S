I haven't had a bit of trouble with the real DEC chips. I only had one
machine that I put them in to. When I would put the card in with any of
the kernel drivers (2.0.36) both the LiteOn card and the real card would
stop working! After getting the absolute newest drivers from Donald
Becker's page, both cards functioned, but when I came in the next morning,
I had about 20 minutes of uptime. The machine was our company internet
gateway, so as soon as I reboot, my phone lights up, which prevents me
from further testing.
I don't know the model of the board, but below is the /proc/pci stuff.
There were some other people that were having problems and determined the
chipset was sending out SMI interrupts.
