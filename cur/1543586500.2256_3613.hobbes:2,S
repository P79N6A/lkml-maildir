I've noticed a similar situation:
I recently upgraded to XFree86 4.0.3 and have been having nothing but
problems with it. Often times, the machine will crash, with crap shot to
the screen. Howver, the IP stack still functions, routes packets, but none
of the user processes respond. I'll try and hit sysrq-s to sync the disks,
sysrq-u to unmount them, and sysrq-b to boot the machine. Unfortunately,
the only one that responds is sysrq-b, which boots the box without
syncing or unmounting the disks. Not only does that piss me off but it's
led to some fs corruption as well (which pisses me off even more). sysrq-b
is the *only* combination I can get working when this happens. However,
when the machine is *not* locked, sysrq-[su] work fine. Kernel is
2.4.3-pre6 on SMP i686.
