All allocations from a single slab have the same set of allowed types of 
zones. I.e. a DMA slab can access only ZONE_DMA a regular slab 
ZONE_NORMAL, ZONE_DMA32 and ZONE_DMA.

That works if zones do not vary between slab requests. So on SMP (without 
extra gfp flags) we may be fine. But see other concerns below.

The gfp zone mask is used to select the zones in a SMP config. But not in 
a NUMA configuration there the zones can come from multiple nodes.
Ok in an SMP configuration the zones are determined by the allocation 
flags. But then there are also the gfp flags that influence reclaim 
behavior. These also have an influence on the memory pressure.
These are
__GFP_IO
__GFP_FS
__GFP_NOMEMMALLOC
__GFP_NOFAIL
__GFP_NORETRY
__GFP_REPEAT
An allocation that can call into a filesystem or do I/O will have much 
less memory pressure to contend with. Are the ranks for an allocation
with __GFP_IO|__GFP_FS really comparable with an allocation that does not 
have these set?

Note that we have not yet investigated what weird effect memory policy 
constraints can have on this. There are issues with memory policies only 
applying to certain zones.....
