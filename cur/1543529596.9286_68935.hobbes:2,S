That's odd; I first noticed the problem in 2.3.51, and started backtracking.
Checking the archives... Ahh, yes; I even remember seeing the patch before.
Checking the source... it's not there. Checking the Makefile... oh. Apparently,
I'm an idiot. It looks like I didn't actually apply the 2.3.51 patch.
That explains it.
I'm going to go sit in the corner now with a dunce cap on my head.
