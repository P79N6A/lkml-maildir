With 100MBit it took about 5 minutes to overflow the 32bit byte counters
(too less for typical mrtg and Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem in
mind), with 1GBit it takes about 30 seconds.
If you consider this appreciable... well :)

Of course, it's usually enough time for a typical userspace application
to get scheduled at least twice.
