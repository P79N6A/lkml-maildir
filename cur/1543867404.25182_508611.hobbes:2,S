VMS had SYS$QIO which is asynchronous I/O queueing with completions of
sorts. You had to specifically remember if you wanted to a synchronous
I/O.
Nothing afaik quite like series of commands batched async, although VMS
has a call for everything else so its possible there is one buried in the
back of volume 347 of the grey wall ;)
Looking at the completion side I'm not 100% sure we need async_wait given
the async batches can include futex operations...
