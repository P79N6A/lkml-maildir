Hi everyone,
sorry for the long delay
- I first had to get home & set up my rig to reproduce this hardlock
(repeatedly hardlocking / shutting down the laptop doesn't do too good
to the new hdd ;) )
and fortunately I was successful :)
sorry for the bad quality of the pics (they were taken with my phone):

steps to reproduce:
1.) log on
2.) startx
3.) opening some pure 64bit apps == working, no locks
4.) opening 32bit-apps (such as firefox-bin, thunderbird-bin) == hard
lock, only pulling power cord (on laptop) or reset button (rig) works,
magic sysrq key doesn't (keyboard & mouse == dead)
I'm currently writing from my "rescue system" (winxp ;) )
so if you need my kernel-config or some more info of the system please tell
Cheers
Mat
