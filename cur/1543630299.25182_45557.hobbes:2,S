This is why in SVr4, struct cred is cloned at open time, and passed
down to each VFS operation.
There's a choice of security modules here--- should the credentials
of the opener or the credentials of the writer determine the use of
the extra space?  I think in this case it ought to be the credentials
of the opener.  Also, I'm not sure that mount(8) should be a setuid
program. (I know it's convenient for floppy mounts, but I'd rather
they were handled by autofs)
