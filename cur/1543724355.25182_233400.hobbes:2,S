I've conducted some of the old fashioned Benno's latency test on this 
patch in various sysctl configurations. This was done on top of a 
different tree but everything else was kept static. I have to preface 
these results by saying I don't really get the 50ms size latencies 
normally but I'm usually unable to get better than 3ms so I wasn't sure 
what to expect.
Only the both preempt off showed any "outlying" results with one spike 
of ~20ms but the rest of the time being ~3ms. Enabling both forms of 
preempt seemed to help a little but nothing drastic, and never below 
1ms. It was not universal that the latencies were better, but there was 
a trend towards better latency. I suspect that those who are getting 
huge latencies may see a bigger change with this patch than I did.
