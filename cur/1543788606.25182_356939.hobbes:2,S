My application has hundreds/thousands of threads doing simultaneous small 
reads, with infrequent small writes. Any problems would probably be mitigated 
by having loads of ram for linux to use as disk cache, but this does seem to 
be an access model at which the 3ware hardware is not good at handling. Of 
course, it never hurts to remind them in a public forum; nothing focuses the 
corporate mind better than bad press ;)
