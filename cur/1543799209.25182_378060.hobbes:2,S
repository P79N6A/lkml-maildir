please, lets let the -rt tree out of the equation. The SLAB code is fine 
on upstream, and it was a pure practical maintainance decision to go for 
SLOB in the -rt tree. Yes, the SLAB code is complex, but i could hardly 
list any complexity in it tht isnt justified with a performance 
argument. _Maybe_ the SLAB code could be further cleaned up, maybe it 
could even be replaced, but we'd have to see the patches first. In any 
case, the -rt tree is not an argument that matters.
