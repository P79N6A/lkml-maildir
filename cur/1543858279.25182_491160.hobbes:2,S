I wasn't sure what context the callers would be when I originally
wrote this code. I will have a careful think of what this will be
used in, and then have a look at changing it.

Yes, will change.

Thanks, mistake when fitting locking in, fixed for next release.

Is this a read from an device register to cause the PCI writes
to happen? Would reading SM501_POWER_MODE_CONTROL be ok, or does
it require a different register?

Ok, fixed.

These pointers where meant to be kept for setting new resources'
parent pointers, will check what happened.

Thanks for the prompt and useful reply.
