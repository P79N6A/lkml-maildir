This being a SMP machine, pid 2 and 3 must be the migration threads.

Do you know what these processes are (12 and 13)?

FYI, The above are all of higher priority than the below.

Wow! that's a lot on a shared IRQ.  Do you have the ide2 being used. If
one of these where to spin for a while, then all the below would freeze.
Also them being preempted will also have a problem.  Perhaps you want to
raise the priority of this interrupt thread.

Yes please (compress it as well).  With so much shared on an IRQ and you
are disabling it, it might cause some large timeouts. The disable irq with
the hardirqs as threads is a sleep (that's where you hit the bug) where as
otherwise it just spins and waits.  So it can be a timing issue.
Could also you try running the RT kernel without hardirqs as threads to
see if it works fine then?

I see you are pinning all the irqs to CPU0

So all but the 3 gpiohsd and eprm are being used?  Still that seems to be
a lot.  But anyway, send me the compressed task dump, and I'll take a
look.  Maybe it will shed some light.
