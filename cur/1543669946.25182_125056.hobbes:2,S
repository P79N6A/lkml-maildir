But it is that simple. If you need to update the file with the
memory copy an explicit msync() must be used. Also note that
msync() takes some parameters that may be different in different
processes that access that mmapped file. Therefore, even msync()
goesn't guarantee that everything gets updated for the next
power outage. So, if you absolutely-posix-a-tively need to get
that data onto a disk, they you need to use some kind of signaling
mechanism (to pause all writers), explicitly write everything from
the lowest to the highest, update your check-point file and close
it, then restart all writers. Upon restart, you can unwind to
the check-point file and restart.
