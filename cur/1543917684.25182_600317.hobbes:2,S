Not at all.  1024k stripes are way outside the norm.  If you do something way 
outside the norm, and don't tune for it in advance, don't be terribly surprised 
when something like bonnie++ brings your box to its knees.
That's not to say we couldn't make md auto-tune itself more intelligently, but 
this isn't really a bug.  With a sufficiently huge amount of RAM, you'd be able 
to dynamically allocate the buffers that you're not pre-allocating with 
stripe_cache_size, but bonnie++ is eating that up in this case.
