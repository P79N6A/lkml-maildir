It is not about particular case, it is about whole environment.
* interactive:
    shell (profile setup).--> source editing / patching
                          `-> building parts / doing tests
    where profile is one particular source tree with particular
    config/development goals. On multiple terminals (sessions), one
    may just type in favorite shell `wana profile-xx` and environment
    is set up there. I.e.
    + where ever you are, it's easy to go to current obj or src tree,
    + quilt knows its setup
    + kbuild does also
    + tracking files, sent to editor (e.g. emacsclient / emacsserver)
      o easily composing file / change sets to be operated by quilt
      o kbuild knows exactly what to check and possibly to rebuild
    + all actions are written to history, that can be imported into any session
      o saving sessions
      o restore sessions: checking profile consistency / updating
    + less ugly (e.g. just stupid bash command line) user interface
      o even ordinary command line can be improved much-much more in
        terms of efficiency and comfort
      o more nice-looking information of what is happening and how is
        happening
* automatic:
    running setup of selected profiles:
    o patch/update sources
    o configure and (cross) build multiple source trees with multiple output
      trees each.
    o run time testing: emulators, hardware.
Many ideas, collected in kbuild-2.5-history.tar.bz2 back in 2000, are
still interesting and useful.
More i do development, more i realize, that i spend too much time to
do trivial and repeating things. And this time will not go less, if
something like that will be by hand.
I'd really like to see a work flow of best development staff, because
behind patches i can not see anything. And frankly, i doubt there's
anything significant there. The only sharing of tools i can see is
patch scripts (now quilt), diff-tools, linux/scripts. Still just tools.
There's no environment, where people would know particular configs for
editors, mailers, 2-3 steps easy to get right help messages, i.e
*environment*. UI tricks, like common, most useful, sh aliases for using
tools, different color schemas: for error/log output, editing C or asm
(with linux specific annotations, rules), tools like checkpatch, but not
checkpatch -- helper for developers to get changes checked and ready to
create actual patch, etc. etc. etc....
For example, i'd really like to have, candy C + diff color fontlocking
(emacs' brain damaged lexicon) for easy patch reviewing. I did some
trivial enhancements more than 3 years ago, like highlighting of actions
that change variable's value, thus, i don't do many stupid things in C any
more. I'd like to have candy fontlocking for sed and shell and
sed-in-shell syntax, etc. etc.
And all this is needed just for stupid terminal emulator. So, what
people are doing all this time? Noo, X? There's no X, period.
