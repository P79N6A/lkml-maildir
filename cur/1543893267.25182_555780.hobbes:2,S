I suspect that David meant that if you were using "unique label per
file" as an implementation technique to implement AA on top of SELinux,
that you would then need a regexp to discern labels.
It's hard to recall with all the noise, but at this point in the thread
the discussion is about the best way to implement AA. Some have alleged
that AA layered on top of SELinux is the best way. I think that is
clearly wrong; AA layered on top of SELinux is possible, but would
require a bunch of enhancements to SELinux first, and the result would
be more complex than the proposed AA patch and have weaker functionality
and performance.
