Personally, I prefer to see filenames.  Or function names.  Sometimes it's
rather unobvious how to go from module name to filename, due to a) multiple
.o files being linked together, b) subsystems which insist on #including .c
files in .c files (usb...) and c) the module system's cute habit of
replacing underscores with dashes in module names.
