Do you think that disabling HT (how I do it? noht?) will make things works
better? I suspect that a process is scheduled on a virtual processor that
doesn't get much chances to execute something. I don't know.

The problem with HT is the one that I describe here. From time to time a
process (mc, bash) is stuck for 2-6 seconds and then comes back. In test8
this was more visible.
Thank you very much, Nick!
