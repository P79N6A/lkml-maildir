Subject: [PPC64] Hugepage hash flushing bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew, Linus, please apply:
Fix a potentially bad (although very rarely triggered) bug in the
ppc64 hugepage code.  hpte_update() did not correctly calculate the
address for hugepages, so pte_clear() (which we use for hugepage ptes
as well as normal ones) would not correctly flush the hash page table
entry.  Under the right circumstances this could potentially lead to
duplicate hash entries, which is very bad.
davem's upcoming patch to pass the virtual address directly to
set_pte() and its ilk will obsolete this, but this is bad enough it
should probably be fixed in the meantime.
