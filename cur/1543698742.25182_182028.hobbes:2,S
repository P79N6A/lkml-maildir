Another point worth mentioning is that if the Linux kernel headers are 
pure GPL, then user land programs that use the Linux kernel headers 
themselves would also be pure GPL by extension if the above argument 
holds water. Clearly the Linux developers would like to believe 
otherwise, but there are many Linux user mode programs that will make use 
of GPL kernel headers in their non-GPL programs. And some of that code 
will include inline assembler and inline functions to make calls into the 
kernel.
Likewise, by extension, any runtime library that uses GPL header files 
from the kernel directly would have to also be pure GPL. This means glibc 
folks. We all know glibc is LGPL, but if you link pure GPL code with LGPL 
code the entire work must be *GPL*, not LGPL if it is considered a 
derived work.
