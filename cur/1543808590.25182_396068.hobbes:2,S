Subject: jsm: Email address of Wendy Xiong is bouncing

The email address wendyx@us.ltcfwd.linux.ibm.com of Wendy Xiong present 
in three files under drivers/serial/jsm/ is bouncing.
Is there a new address, or should the old one simply be removed?
As a related note, can we move the maintainer information from the 
source files to MAINTAINERS?

       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
