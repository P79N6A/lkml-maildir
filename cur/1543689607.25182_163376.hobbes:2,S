OK, having actually read what dmesg says (instead of making assumptions),
I see:
    hda: max request size: 128KiB
    hda: cannot use LBA48 - full capacity 390721968 sectors (200049 MB)
    hda: 268435456 sectors (137438 MB) w/8192KiB Cache, CHS=16709/255/63, UDMA(100)
     hda: hda1 hda2 hda3 hda4
and fdisk reports:
   # /sbin/fdisk -l
   Disk /dev/hda: 137.4 GB, 137438953472 bytes
   255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 16709 cylinders
   Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
      Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
   /dev/hda1   *         1        13    104391   83  Linux
   /dev/hda2            14      1057   8385930   83  Linux
   /dev/hda3          1058      1188   1052257+  82  Linux swap
   /dev/hda4          1189      6169  40009882+  83  Linux
So the disk is being correctly downgraded to a non-lba48-compatible size.
In which case, why is the disk getting trashed?
Maybe there's a fault on the disk itself? I'll find a system that does lba48
and try it there...
Steve.
