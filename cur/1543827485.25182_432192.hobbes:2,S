This appears to be a real bug:
A normal pkt dvd block dev open takes the
bdev_mutex in the regular block device open path, which takes
ctl_mutex in the pkt_open function which gets called then from
the block layer.
HOWEVER the IOCTL path does it the other way around:
                 mutex_lock(&ctl_mutex);
                 ret = pkt_setup_dev(&ctrl_cmd);
                 mutex_unlock(&ctl_mutex);
where pkt_setup_dev in term calls pkt_new_dev which
calls blkdev_get(), which takes the bdev_mutex.
Looks very much like a AB-BA deadlock to me...
Jens?
