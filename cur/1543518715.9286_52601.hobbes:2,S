I have the same sound chip, and badly need the joystick port (I don't
care about sound). Does the data sheet help in enabling the joystick
port? If yes, could you Alan (or anybody) please mail the sheet to
me? Or does anyone know how to enable the joystick port?
I am not on the mail list, so please CC any answers to <bjorn@lifix.fi>.
