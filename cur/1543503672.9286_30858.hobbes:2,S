No, not really. Quite a bit more than some 20 us jitter would be
acceptable...

I'd say both. In order to be usable for professional audio (live in
particular), these applications NEED to meet EVERY deadline. If there
can be occational drop-outs when doing reasonably low latency
processing, I'm going elsewhere.
Until now, dedicated DSP hardware has been the way of doing what
Audiality will do. Without hard real time, that won't change. The whole
idea with this hard real time engine is to enable low latency processing
without external hardware. It's NOT the average audio API, or
whatever... That part still belongs in soft real time user space.

Yep, I know, and fixing that might be enough. However, is that enough to
guarantee that a real time task will get control within any defined
time? I want figures. Hard, real, reliable figures.

That would be very nice indeed! :-)

I suspect there are similarities between some of Linus' objections and
mine...
Anyway, the main reason why I haven't even tried KURT yet (guess I
should) is the normal/RT mode idea. IMHO, no application should EVER
shut some parts of the system out. If there's free CPU time and work to
be done, get to it! Unless every part of the OS is completely functional
even when some tasks require hard real time scheduling, the system is
crippled. Not the way to go. Again, just MHO... (I might be missinformed
regarding the latest developments around KURT.)

What is an audio application?
This is what I have in mind anyway:
Your soft/firm real time application stays in user space, and use the
Audiality Client Application Interface, much like it would use OSS or
ALSA. (There will be compatible interfaces as well.) The big difference
is that it may use plug-ins running under the low latency engine as if
they were running on a dedicated DSP. You may still do "high latency"
processing in the application just as it's done now.
I intend to make it possible to run Audiality plug-ins in user space as
well, as that's the simplest and most efficient way to do off-line, non
real time processing. And it also means you can just steal the user
space plug-in host and use the plug-ins, if you really can't stand the
hard real time engine. ;-)
