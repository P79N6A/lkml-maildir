Maybe What I said is not clear and correct. In fact, the elilo follows
the boot protocol defined in Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt, just
not uses arch/(i386|x86_64)/boot/setup.S to collect the information,
but collects them by elilo itself. Information in
include/asm-x86_64/bootsetup.h is just a part of that in
Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt.

Is what defined in Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt the standard boot
protocol. If it is, the elilo follows it. My previous expressing is
not clear and correct.
