BUG_ON(len != strlen(string));
I don't want the strlen() executed on an embedded machine every time
I hit that piece of code, heck, probably not even my server if string 
is big
or if this code is executed many times.

Ok, so then we need an additional config directive:
CONFIG_EMBEDDED_NODEBUG
Then:
#ifdef CONFIG_EMBEDDED_NODEBUG
# define BUG_ON(cond) do { if (cond); } while(0)
# define BUG_CHECK(cond) do { } while(0)
#else
# define BUG_ON(cond) do { if (cond) BUG(); } while(0)
# define BUG_CHECK(cond) do { if (cond) BUG(); } while(0)
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG
# define DEBUG_ON(cond) do { } while(0)
#else
# define DEBUG_ON(cond) do { if (cond) BUG(); } while(0)
#endif
It's the _exact_same_ problem, with different definitions for which
mode is "debugging mode" in this particular case.  I agree with the
above email, but I think that for the embedded people, we should
define an extra macro that removes all excess tests, whether they
are expensive or inexpensive.  Then the BUG_ON() macro would
leave any checks in place in such a specialized compile, because
they may have required side effects.  A similar DEBUG_ON()
macro would be disabled for general users, but could be enabled
with DEBUG to provide the expensive checks, when a user is
experiencing problems.
