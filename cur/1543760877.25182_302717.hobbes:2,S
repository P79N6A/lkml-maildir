Can you tell me how the invisible high-word (invisible in VM-86, and
in real mode) could possibly harm something running in VM-86 or
read-mode ???  I don't even think it's a BUG. If the transition
into and out of VM-86 doesn't handle the fact that the high-word
of the stack hasn't been used in VM-86, then that piece of code
is bad (the SP isn't even the same stack, BTW).
Cheers,
