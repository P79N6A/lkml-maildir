I just booted to 2.4.1-ac13, and was fine for a couple minutes.  Then
all network connectivity went away, and I had this sitting in syslog:
Feb 14 16:45:48 patience kernel: LDT allocated for cloned task!

Hence, I'm back to 2.4.1-ac12, and sending this in.  No other noticible
problems in my short-lived uptime ;-)
