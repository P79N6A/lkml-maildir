yup, the patch looks fine, thanks.
It will in practice be OK calling balance_dirty_pages() once per 16 pages
but one should try to be a good little kernel citizen and do the right
thing, I guess.

I think the macros are pretty foul too (perhaps we should migrate it to
"div_round_up()").
But we should migrate to them.  Because once one has learned what a
particular helper like this does, the code becomes more readable, more
understandable and easier to verify correct behaviour.  Whereas the
open-coded arithmetic is _always_ suspect and always needs to be checked
each time one's eye passes over it.
And then there's the ongoing pitter-patter of "convert to DIV_ROUND_UP"
patches in my inbox ;)
It's not, however, our biggest problem.
