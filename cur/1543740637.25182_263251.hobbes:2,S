What mails are you reading?!
Personally, I could not care less about the deadlock detection. If it's
a priority for you personally or due to corporate reasons, fine, but
don't involve me.
I have made no attacks on your deadlock detection other than to state
the obvious - that it has cases where it triggers on perfectly legit
code. If you read that as "implied personal attacks" or "juvenile
behaviour" then you need to grow thicker skin. The only personal attacks
here are the ones coming from you.
