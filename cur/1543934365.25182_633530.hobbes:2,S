I myself have been faced with this question before, and I think we 
should try to clarify this by adding a document with some guidelines to 
Documentation/usb.
So, to get the ball rolling, here are some factors that IMHO help decide 
in which side to implement a driver:
  - if the driver ties a hardware device to an existing in-kernel 
interface (network, block, serial, bluetooth, video4linux, etc.), it 
should probably be implemented in-kernel.
  - on the other hand, if the driver doesn't use an existing kernel 
interface and creates a new user-visible interface that is going to be 
used by a single userspace application, it should probably be done in 
userspace.
  - if it is going to be used by several applications it could still be 
implemented as a library, but it starts moving into the gray area.
  - performance might be a reason to move to kernel space, but I don't 
think it matters for transfer rates below 10Mbytes/sec or so.
Anyway, this is just MHO, so feel free to discuss this further. I'm 
simply volunteering to sum up this thread into a patch to add a 
Documentation/usb/userspace_drivers.txt (or something like that), so 
that we can help future developers decide where to write their drivers.
