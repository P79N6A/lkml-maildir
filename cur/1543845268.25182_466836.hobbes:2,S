I pointed it out on linux-arch a couple of weeks ago.  Ever look at the
generic__raw_read_trylock implementation?

If the cpu has the lock held for write, is interrupted, and the interrupt
handler calls read_trylock(), it's an instant deadlock.
Now, Dave Miller has subsequently pointed out that we don't have any
situations where this can occur.  Nevertheless, we should delete
generic__raw_read_lock (and its associated EXPORT to make Arjan happy)
so that nobody thinks they can use it.
