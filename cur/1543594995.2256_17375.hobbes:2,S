Then QNX is not the QNX that I have used.

The QNX that I have used, advertised as QNX, and been around since
32-bit ix86 was available, is EXACTLY as I stated.

If you have used a different QNX, then QNX has either changed
radically, or is a different company/QNX than what I used.
And, I had a lot of good experiences with it since standard
I/O was provided, as was boot, but it was an open book otherwise
in which you were not prevented from doing anything you wanted
to do, at any instant you wanted to do it.
