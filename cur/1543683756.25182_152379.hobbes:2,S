dbench 32 hang on 2.6.0-test2.  /proc/PID/wchan shows
dbench process in sys_pause, /proc/PPID/wchan shows
other dbench in sys_wait4.
kill -CONT on the two dbench PIDs has the child
wchan change to __pdflush, but the processes don't
appear to continue, nor exit.  After waiting a couple
minutes, I did kill on both PIDs and dbench exited.
This was ext2 filesystem.  Previous was ext3 and 
reiserfs.
sysrq t after "kill -CONT" is at:
