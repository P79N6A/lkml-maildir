What you illustrated above is not going to work.
If your doing #ifndef around a function, such as scsi_device_online, it's
not going to compile
when scsi_device_online is already implemented in the kernel tree.
The routine scsi_device_online is a function, not a define.  For a define
this would work.
I'm trying your example around msleep, msleep_interruptible, and
msecs_to_jiffies, and 
my code simply won't compile in SLES9 SP2(-191).  In SLES9 SP1(-139), these
three routines were not implemented and
your suggestion works.  I won't be able to to a linux version check as this
change occurred between service packs
of the 2.6.5 kernel suse tree.   Anybody on the linux forums have any ideas?
Example:
#ifdef msleep
static void inline msleep(unsigned long msecs)
{
        set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
        schedule_timeout(msecs_to_jiffies(msecs) + 1);
}
#endif
