:-). Is it problem for someone else then me trying to swap over network?

I was told that is "almost always" true. sct, could you comment on
this? (This patch does not count them)

That's the way kreclaimd was expected to work...
...with one slight change. I wanted kswapd to _also_ reclaiming those
pages. That can't hurt, and is closer to current system. That ways,
kreclaimd should be called only very rarely.
