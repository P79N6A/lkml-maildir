I happen to have an old laptop with an nm256, that I would gladly part
with, but it doesn't boot because of a hardware problem: it will shut
itself off between 5 and 30 seconds of turning on.  Last time I
checked it seemed to be a not-worth-fixing problem with a lot of VAIOs
of that generation.  I doubt this is worth anything to anyone but if
it is, let me know.
