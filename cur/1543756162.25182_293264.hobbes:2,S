It sorts sucks for users with that hardware.  The typical complaint 
comes from trying to share data between Windows and Linux, where "just 
use md" isn't a solution.
Without device mapper (another new feature) to enable dmraid, these 
users are just sorta S.O.L.
I consider it not a new feature, but a missing feature, since otherwise 
user data cannot be accessed in the RAID setups.
