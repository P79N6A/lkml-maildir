When ide-scsi is loaded, box a with a symbios scsi board does NOT work,
the scanner does not work.
Oct 12 18:39:23 p3 kernel: Attached scsi generic sg2 at scsi0, channel
0, id 3, lun 0,  type 6
Oct 12 18:39:23 p3 kernel: sym53c875-0-<3,*>: target did not report
SYNC.
Oct 12 18:39:23 p3 kernel: ide-scsi: The scsi wants to send us more data
than expected - discarding data
Oct 12 18:39:23 p3 kernel: ide-scsi: transferred 5 of 6 bytes
When I unload ide-scsi, and load the scsi module all by itself, it works
fine.
What an evil bug/problem!
With box b, I have an adaptec and ide-scsi both built into the kernel,
and they work great.
