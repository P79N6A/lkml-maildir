An IBMer sent a formal notice to the MPLS mailing some months ago.  Curtis
Villamizar, among other MPLS luminaries, asked for further clarification,
but the topic seems to have dropped off the face of the earth.  Later on
there was talk that iBM was simply pointing out that there might be some
patents applicable, or words to that effect, but not much else.  I'll ask
the list what the resolution was.
