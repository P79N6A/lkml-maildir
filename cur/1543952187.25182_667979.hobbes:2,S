Hi hpa,
I believe you... and the Makefile_32.cpu: it gets a -march=i686. I
also found out that I missed X86_ELAN, which is treated as a i486.
Also, MGEODE_LX does not get any optimization flags. I think that
is unintentional, but what should they be?
And MPSC (Intel P4 / older Netburst based Xeon) depends on X86_64.
I would be very surprised if that one could not run 32-bit code,
though. What flags should that one get?
Thanks for pointing out I missed Crusoe. As a punishment you
can answer my questions ;).
Greetings,
    Alexander
