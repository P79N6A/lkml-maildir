Subject: [PATCH 01/11] unpaged: get_user_pages VM_RESERVED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The PageReserved removal in 2.6.15-rc1 prohibited get_user_pages on the
areas flagged VM_RESERVED in place of PageReserved.  That is correct in
theory - we ought not to interfere with struct pages in such a reserved
area; but in practice it broke BTTV for one.
So revert to prohibiting only on VM_IO: if someone gets into trouble
with get_user_pages on VM_RESERVED, it'll just be a "don't do that".
You can argue that videobuf_mmap_mapper shouldn't set VM_RESERVED in the
first place, but now's not the time for breaking drivers without notice.
