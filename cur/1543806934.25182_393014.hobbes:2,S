Here are some other things out there worth considering:
* SCSI XOR commands
* Figuring out how to support Promise SX4 (e.g. device offload), which 
is a chip with integrated XOR engine and attached DIMM.  RAID1 and RAID5 
are best implemented on-card, but the Linux driver is responsible for 
implementing all on-card actions, not a firmware.
