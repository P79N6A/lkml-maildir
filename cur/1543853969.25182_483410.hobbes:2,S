> I believe tslib handles this.
The special X server "KDrive" supports tslib, this is used in 
many embedded projects, e.g. by images created via 
http://www.openembedded.org
. But mainline X.org server, e.g. 
what is in Debian unstable (7.1.0), doesn't support tslib.
Also I don't know if X/tslib allows re-calibration on-the-fly, 
but I guess it does. However, tslib usually does not work via 
the input subsystem (/dev/input/eventX is just one of them), 
most devices use proprietary kernel interfaces.
Qt/Embedded for Qt 2 and Qt 3 doesn't handle tslib 
out-of-the-box, (heck, the don't even know 
about /dev/input/eventX), but patches exist.
But I think we can stop this thread now :-)
