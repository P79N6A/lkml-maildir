Hmm... I can see at least one aspect in which it may be of some importance
where the said module is put - it's the translation issue. It's easier to
maintain the various translations of the error messages when they're kept
outside of the kernel, actually I think that maintaining them in the kernel
would be really bad idea, if possible at all. And i18n is quite an important
issue.

I agree. Every error message sent to the system logs should contain both the
prefix of some kind uniquely identifying the error and also a translation.
For the bug reports sent to the kernel maintainers, the log should be piped
through some filter and the output should always be in English. It's easy to
do, I think.

Well, I'm sorry for reinventing the wheel, then :)) - I just don't remember
the post :(((.

Hmm... yes. If the error handling package was a loadable module, no
performance penalty would take place.

I fully agree with you - spent too much time trying to decipher some "user
friendly" Winblows error codes...

Those fatal ones should be stuck to the core kernel code, always printed in
English and, if klogd (or any other "interpreter" of kernel errors) still
works, translated anyway.

The only problem I can see is the developers - they would have to get used
to putting error messages in some standard place, not directly in the code -
unless some pre-compilation magic is employed and all messages replaced with
some codes or calls of appriopriate type before compiling the kernel.
