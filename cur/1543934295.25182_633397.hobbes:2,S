There are all the proper accessors, and arithmetic is certainly not possible.

You mean osd_cdb_offset_t. I thought of dropping that _t, I hate it,
just a personal preference.
Point taken about the typedef + __bitwise. Because with __bitwise we
tell the compiler that the new type is assembly equivalent to some type
but otherwise un-mixable and unique type. Checkpatch actually allows
it. Code fixed! Thanks Christoph.
