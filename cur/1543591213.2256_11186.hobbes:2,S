NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
The kernel, when asked to report on the disks physically attached to the 
machine, should report the location and *volume* name.
It should never just mount things when there is a conflict. Make the user 
resolve the conflict immediately by being more specific.
Partition names are sacrosanct. They should always work within the relative 
filesystem.
If I have a disk with /, /usr and /var, I want mentions of ../var to work 
correctly in scripts in usr, assuming I have usr and var mounted into /.
