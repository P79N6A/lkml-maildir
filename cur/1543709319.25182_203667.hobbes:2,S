ppc.patch removes arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c and adds a new file kgdb.c I 
think that has a greater rejection chance.
Let's not change the direction now. Some time ago there was another view that 
x86_64 would be easier. We have already had sufficient headache because of 
split -lite -heavy patches. Let's try to finish that asap.
