Hi all
I recently got this laptop, Dell Latitude CPi 400 PPX. Problem is the
audio adapter, which isn't really supported by the kernel as far as I can
see. It's listed in /proc/pci as follows:
  Bus  1, device   0, function  1:
    Multimedia audio controller: Neomagic Unknown device (rev 0).
      Vendor id=10c8. Device id=8006.
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 5.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf5800000 [0xf5800008].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfda00000 [0xfda00000].
I would appreciate any suggestions on how I could get some better sounds
out of this than the general PC-speaker-beep... :)
