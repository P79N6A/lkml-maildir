hi,
i think this problem may have as much to do with my lack of SCSI
knowledge as problems with the driver.
i have an advansys controler card and a Philips CDD3600 cd-rewriter.
whenever i do something stupid such as trying to read from a cd which
isnt there or interrupting a read, it just freezes up. any subsequent
call to the cd-writer fails and i just get a whole lot of garbage in
my logs:
Mar 16 12:25:56 appc-keith kernel: advansys: asc_isr_callback: scp is NULL
Mar 16 12:25:56 appc-keith kernel: advansys: advansys_reset: reset request
not active or waiting, completing anyway c037a000
Mar 16 12:25:56 appc-keith kernel: scsi0: device driver called scsi_done()
for a syncronous reset.
Mar 16 12:26:06 appc-keith kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout
: pid 63012, scsi0, channel 0, id 4, lun 0 Prevent/Allow Medium Removal 00
00 00 00 00  
the only way of regaining control is to reboot. this is really 
irritating. is there any way to prevent this happening or to regain
control *without* rebooting?
whilst i'm on the subject - cdparanoia no longer works with 2.2.x.
it used to work with 2.0.x.
i now get the following error:
SCSI transport: writeable when reading packet
any help would be ... err ... helpfull.
thanks.
keith.
