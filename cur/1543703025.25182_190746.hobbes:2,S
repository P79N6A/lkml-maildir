This seems to be something far more insidious.
When the CPU is under load, the buzzing disappears.
When something else is using /dev/dsp, the buzzing disappears.
When I reboot to 2.6.1-rc1-mm1, the buzzing disappears ;)
Any idea what is going on? And plus, even when the buzzing is gone,
there is a lot of static in played music, etc. It's overall not a good
listening experience. I know this could be due to the fact that I use
onboard sound but since it worked just fine in 2.6.1-rc1-mm1 I don't see
why it should be screwed up in 2.6.1-mm2.
