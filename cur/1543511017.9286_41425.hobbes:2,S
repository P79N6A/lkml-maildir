nope.  swap daemon locks pages on init, doesn't get swapped out so doesn't
block.  the swap daemon shouldn't grow in size in the first place.  should
something happen that consumes all available memory, the OOM handler exists
to free memory.  reboot not required.

just because there is no more memory doesn't mean a program should crash.  if
this is the way you write code, i recommend a moment of thought.
with just a minor bit of thought, memory paging control and disk ops can be
handled sweetly and succintly without problems.  and there's a beautiful
-ENOMEM type of return when you really can't get any more memory.
