Subject: [PATCH][PPC32] Marvell host bridge support (mv64x60)

Precedence: bulk

This patch adds core support for a line of host bridges from Marvell 
(formerly Galileo).  This code has been tested with a GT64260a, 
GT64260b, MV64360, and MV64460.  Patches for platforms that use these 
bridges will be sent separately.
The patch is rather large so a link is provided.
