I agree fully, that shared subtrees would be very useful.

I'd rather not speculate on what Al Viro was thinking, it may have
been just a misunderstanding.

Yes.  But that's not fundamentally different from explicitly passing a
mount (through a file descriptor) to a process in a different
namespace, and allowing that process to bind mount it in it's native
namespace.
The end result can be exactly the same, only in the shared subtree
case the binding is implicit, while in the other case it's explicit on
both sides (which makes it perfectly secure even for unprivileged use)
Please explain why you think it's wrong to be able to bind mount from
a different namespace?

What do you mean by cross contamination?
