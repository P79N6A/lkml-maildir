   Drivers should never change resource values, because they know nothing
about relationship between physical addresses as seen by the kernel and
configuration register contents.
   I've already swept out such things from the IDE drivers (I sent
the patch to Andre a few minutes ago) and I'll try to look at the
remaining cases soon.
				Have a nice fortnight
