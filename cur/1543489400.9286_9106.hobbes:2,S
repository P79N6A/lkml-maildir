You should be looking for any good reason to choose one format over
another, not just technical reasons.  Networks were built by humans and
debugged by humans.  Quite frankly looking at raw network packets off of
a wire is much easier to read if it's readable by humans (and, yes, this
is exactly what I've done in the past).  The machines don't know, nor do
they care about the correct ordering of data.  What's important is that
when it breaks there needs to be an easy way for humans to diagnose the
problem, and, quite frankly LE is *not* conducive to that process.

I hate to tell you this, but PC's aren't the only machines out there.
Much of the world runs not on PC's but on *other* machines (like
mainframes).

What an awful thing to say, Linus.  A useful technique for trouble
shooting should be just tossed away as if it were a bad batch of beef?
For shame.

How about "strive for a better Kernel" instead.
