Summary:
- we have processor packages
- each package can handle several (someone said 128+ ;) ) processor cores.
  We really do not mind if they are really independent (power4) or not
  (xeon, ht)
- each core is a logical unit for Linux
- can we have two packages with different number of cores ?
Proposal for /proc/cpuinfo (sample box: an hypothetical TurboPower4 with
4 cores, 2 units on an SMP box):
processor : 0  processor : 2  processor : 4  processor  : 6 
package   : 0  package   : 0  package   : 0  package    : 0  
core      : 0  core      : 1  core      : 2  core       : 3  
processor : 1  processor : 3  processor : 5  processor  : 7 
package   : 1  package   : 1  package   : 1  package    : 1  
core      : 0  core      : 1  core      : 2  core       : 3  
So you can look for siblings based on package number, you can know if
two precessors are in different packages (for sched...), etc.
NOTE: do not know if 'core' name can give problems, perhaps you could use
'unit' instead.
