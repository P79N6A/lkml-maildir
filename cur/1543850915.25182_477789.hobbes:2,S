	Yes. The controller should stay in memory until userspace decides that
control of the resource is no longer desired. Though not all controllers
should be removable since that may impose unreasonable restrictions on
what useful/performant controllers can be implemented.
	That doesn't mean that the controller couldn't reclaim memory it uses
when it's no longer needed.
