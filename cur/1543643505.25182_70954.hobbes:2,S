What bad stuff are you smoking lately? Trying to turn linux into a traffic
generator OS? ;-> Havent you been accused of that already?
Actually, this is probably one of the few times i agree with you because i
may have use for this; i dont think the maintainers may. Infact i think
you are just about to be shot.
How about putting ifdefs so that the code only gets activated if
packetgen is active?
cheers,
jamal
