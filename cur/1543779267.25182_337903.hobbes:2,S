Subject: [patch 2/5] Spelling and whitespace fixes for REPORTING-BUGS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/31/65

From: Tobias Klauser <tklauser@nuerscht.ch>
The attached patch fixes some spelling errors in REPORTING-BUGS and also
removes all trailing whitespaces (I hope this OK with the trivial patch
monkey).
