No, it wasn't my old 8 fluidsynths test. It was just one normal desktop
work session. At the time, IIRC, the only jack clients that were running
were:
    qjackctl (obviously :)
    qsynth   (3 fluidsynth engines, many soundfonts loaded).
    xmms     (via xmms-jack output plugin)
By just taking xmms out from the graph, I can run my desktop environment
(KDE 3.2) for hours without a single XRUN or noticeable delay. And just
before RT-V0.9.31-19 had arrived, that was just a dream ;)
Bye.
