Hello together,
during the last 1.5 weeks I have lost a lot of hair over following .
BACKGROUND: I have a FIC 2012 mainboard with uses the VIA VT82C597
chipset. Attached to the usb port is a usb memory pen drive which serves
as the root device.
PROBLEM: USB produces gets bulk transfer message timeouts for earlier
kernels ~2.4.6. Or inconsistent links (looses link after some time) for
newer kernels ~2.6.7 (messages similar to "refusing I/O to device being
removed" or "refusing I/O to dead device"). I have tried kernels until
2.6.9-rc2 (could not get to run at all).
After lots of research I realized that usb problems with via seem to be
a very common problem but could not find anything definitive.
Can anybody tell me whether this chipset works with any kernel - and if
yes with which? I guess I have to use a different mainboard!?
Thank you very much in advace!
Cheers,
Arik
