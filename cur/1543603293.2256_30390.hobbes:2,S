Hi there,
Any news from VIA if it's OK to reprogram bit 55.1 of the host bridge, to 
fix the K7 optimizations?
Also, is there already a fix for those who get 
hda: lost interrupt
hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hda: drive not ready for command
hda: lost interrupt
hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hda: drive not ready for command
when using CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y ?
My system will do it with this option, but work OK without, although I
haven't measured performance differences. I see many people reporting
similar problems on the archives, but no definite fix. hda is an old 4GB
Western Digital HD that can only do PIO mode 4, I believe. It has a ATAPI
ZIP drive as slave.
Running 2.4.10 here.
TIA,
