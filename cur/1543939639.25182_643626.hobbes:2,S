I don't bisect git trees often - but I'd say that at least half the time
I have to bisect -mm, I'll hit a busticated bisection point and need to
move several one way or another.  Fortunately, Andrew does a good job
of keeping fixes near their parents, so it's usually not *that* hard to
clean up (at least for me - but I recently realized that I had passed the
3-decade mark of breaking and fixing software).  Newcomer kernel testers
are likely in for a rude awakening if they hit one of those points.
