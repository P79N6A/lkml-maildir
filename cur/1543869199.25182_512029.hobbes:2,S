BTW, you can also use CVT modes for nvidiafb, even if the mode in
question is not present in the EDID block.  For example:
video=nvidiafb:1024x768M@60 or 1600x1200M@60 
(The 'M' tells fb_find_mode to do a CVT calculation instead).
If you use a reduced-blanking CVT mode, it might even reduce the snow of
your DVI even at the highest resolution.  So:
video=nvidiafb:1600x1200MR@60
(The additional 'R' will do reduced-blanking CVT calculation)
