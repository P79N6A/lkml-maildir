no, you are wrong, read the current Kconfig rules again. If the user can 
create a .config that does not build, it is driver breakage. It always 
was, and has been in the past 15 years.
Kconfig might be extended to make dependencies easier to manage for 
developers but until that is implemented you have to craft your driver's 
dependencies with the current tools in a way that doesnt break the 
build.
