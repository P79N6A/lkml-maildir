You are changing the topic. Nobody said the current LTT tracepoints have 
to be merged as is. You generalize from a work in progress to static trace 
points in general.

What guarantees we don't have similiar problems with dynamic tracepoints?
As soon as any tracing is merged, users will have some kind of expectation 
and thus you can expect "Why did you change this source? It broke my 
SystemTap script!" here as well.
