This is the behavior of CPU, not kernel. "iret" after "int 0x80",
it restores the eip to "mov ...".
 	int 0x80
        		does syscall
                        iret
 	mov ....
                  <---- exception here (eip = "next insn")
	next insn
        
So single-step exception happen *after* executed the "mov ...".
Probably you need to use the breakpoint instead of single-step.
