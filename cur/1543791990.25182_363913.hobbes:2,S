It's still hacky - I mean, we could use this trick to avoid recursion onto
any lock in the kernel whenever we get ourselves into a mess.  We'd gain an
awful lot of PF_* flags.
So we should still view this as a temporary fix.
I don't think I've seen an analysis of the actual deadlock yet.  Are you
able to provide a stack trace of the offending callpath?
