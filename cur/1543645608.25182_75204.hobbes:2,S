Which reminds me, I was testing 2.5.39 yesterday on a 433MHz x86, 224Mb ram.
I felt this was abit like some of the 2.4.7-2.4.9 kernels i once ran:
too happy swapping things out. Having mozilla and evolution in the background 
while compiling some large projects, or doing lots of file copying 
caused most of mozilla and evolution to be swapped out, and thus the desktop felt 
alot slower than e.g. 2.4.19. 
Other issue, it took me about 2 hours to figure out that it was enabling preemtion
that caused the kernel not to boot.
