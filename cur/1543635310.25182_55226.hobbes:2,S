Subject: [PATCH] 2.4 IDE core for 2.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
I've forward ported the 2.4 IDE core (well 2.4.19-pre10-ac2 to be exact)
to 2.5.25. It consists of 7 separate patches:
00_25ide-compile-1
	Fix 2.5 IDE compilation problem with ide_fix_driveid()
05_25pci-ids-1
	Add missing 2.4 IDE adapter pci ids
10_24ide-core-1
	Add 2.4 IDE core, modified for 2.5 changes
15_24-misc-bits-1
	various bits and pieces to make 2.4 IDE core work
20_split-ide-config-1
	Split 2.4 and 2.5 IDE configuration
25_ide-build-1
	allow 2.4 and 2.5 ide to be built
30_ide-scsi-1
	Add 2.4 ide-scsi version (note that 2.5 with 2.4 ide calls it
	ide-scsi24.o currently, I'll take patches to rectify that).
Find them all here:
*.kernel.org://pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.5/2.5.25/
So why did I do this? Well, I needed stable IDE for 2.5 testing and it
was/is clear that 2.5 just isn't quite there yet. I intend to maintain
this patch set until I deem 2.5 IDE stable enough (in code) that I'm
willing to spend time on that instead. So the life span of this patch
depends heavily on that. That said, I know of others who would like to
be able to test 2.5 and not having to worry too much about the
state-of-the-day of the IDE core. This patch set may be useful to them
as well.
Also some notes on why I _didn't_ do this. I didn't do it because I
think Martin is a jerk or because 2.5 IDE is forever doomed. I didn't do
this because Andre twisted my arm. I didn't do this because of some
hidden agenda.
That said, the patch works for me here. I've ripped out ide-tape and
ide-floppy (frankly, I don't think it's worth my time updating these),
but apart from that I think it's 2.4 feature complete. PIO multi count
breaks for multi page bio's, if you intend to use that you should change
MPAGE_BIO_MAX_SIZE as noted in fs/mpage.c. I'll fix that in the next
iteration.
