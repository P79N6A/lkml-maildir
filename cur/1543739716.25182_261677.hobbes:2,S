So what would that patch need before ACPI could convert to use it?
I didn't notice any obvious associations between the strings in
the acpi/wakeup file and anything in sysfs.  Which of USB1..USB4
was which of the three controllers shown by "lspci" (and which
one was "extra"!), as one head-scratcher.
For PCI, I'd kind of expect pci_enable_wake() to trigger the
additional ACPI-specific work to make sure the device can
actually wake that system.   Seems like dev->platform_data
might need to combine with some platform-specific API hook.
