They do ... you just have to mount cpusets to see it ;).
If your kernel is configured with CONFIG_CPUSETS, then
there is one 'top' cpuset containing all tasks, all mems,
and all cpus, setup during the kernel init boot code,
unconditionally.
Anyone who does:
	mkdir -p /dev/cpuset
	mount -t cpuset cpuset /dev/cpuset
can see it and play with it.
... perhaps I misunderstood your comment?
