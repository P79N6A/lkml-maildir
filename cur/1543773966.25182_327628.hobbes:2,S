I scripted an automatic whitespace cleanup, which resuled in a fat
patchbomb (about 18 MB, split into > 3600 files (because that way, some
patches are going to apply cleanly)). Obviously applying that would increase
the patch size for the next version by 100%, so that won't be the way to go.

)
Therefore I suggest that I will
 - make a script that will take a patch, apply it and cleanup the patched
   files as far as a simple script can do the job, so each patched file
   will be ws-clean and the amount of patches will still stay low.
 - a second script that will do some cleanup while the resulting patch is
   less than an annoying amount of KB, so you can cleanup some files that
   wouldn't get patched otherwise.
