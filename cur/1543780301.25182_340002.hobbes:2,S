Yes, more generic than xen would be better. I think mach-xen is probably
OK for now, but I agree we should avoid wedging xen_* in generic code
callouts. What I'm trying to do right now is rip the whole duplicated
files out of the xen patches.

We're faced with a difficult choice - the xen patches are hard to read
without refactoring them. On the other hand it's going to be very painful
to keep them in sync out of tree whilst doing the refactoring. I'd prefer
to merge up some bits as we go, though maybe I should keep those more
neutral than this. Sigh ... this is going to be extremely painful whatever
we do.
