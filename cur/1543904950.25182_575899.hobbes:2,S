Check the attitude at the door then re-read what I actually said:

I never said that it was the *program* itself - or *any* specific program (I 
used "Updatedb" because it has been the big name in the discussion) - doing 
the filling of memory. I actually said that the problem is that the kernel's 
caches - VFS and others - will grow *WITHOUT* *LIMIT*, filling all available 
memory. 
Swap prefetch on its own will not alleviate *all* of the problem, but it 
appears to fix enough of it that the problem doesn't seem to bother people 
anymore. (As I noted later on there are things that can be changes that would 
also fix things. Those changes, however, are quite tricky and involve changes 
to the page faulting mechanism, the way the various caches work and a number 
of other things)
In light of the fact that swap prefetch appears to solve the problem for the 
people that have been vocal about it, and because it is a less intrusive 
change than the other potential solutions, I'd like to know why all the 
complaints and arguments against it come down to "Its treating the symptom".
I mean it - because I fail to see how it isn't getting at the root of the 
problem - which is, pretty much, that Swap has classically been and, in the 
case of most modern systems, still is damned slow. By prefetching those pages 
that have most recently been evicted the problem of "slow swap" is being 
directly addressed.
You want to know what causes the problem? The current design of the caches. 
They will extend without much limit, to the point of actually pushing pages 
to disk so they can grow even more.

I already did. You completely ignored it because I happened to use the magic 
words "updatedb" and "swap prefetch". 
Did I ever say it was about "updatedb" in particular? You've got the statement 
in the part of my post that you quoted. Nope, appears that I used the name as 
a specific example - and one that has been used previously in the thread. Now 
drop the damned attitude and start using your brain. Okay?
