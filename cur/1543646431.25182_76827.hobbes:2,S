yes it should, just like the MAP_BIGPAGE and several other bits in the
rhas (O_ATOMICLOOKUP etc...):
+#define MAP_BIGPAGE	0x40		/* bigpage mapping */
I attempted doing a sync with mainline for all these potential future
binary-incompatibilities several months ago but it went to /dev/null and
nobody cared to merge these bits into mainline, hopefully this thread
will bring more attention to these kind of patches now.
