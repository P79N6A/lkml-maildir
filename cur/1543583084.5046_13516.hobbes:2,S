Subject: IDE floppy drives and devfs - no device nodes if no disk loaded at boot

Subject says about all there is to say. I have figured out that IDE drives
are enumerated as part of the boot-time partition check in
fs/partitions/check.c, but if I don't have something loaded at boot time
(IDE SuperDisk in PC at home, IDE Zip 100 in G3 tower at work), I never
get device nodes at all with devfs. Something really needs to be done
about this, IMHO.
