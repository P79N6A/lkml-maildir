I see this message too. (And I've got some more details).
Whenever I switch from console to X, I get that message. I presume it is 
due the binary nvidia blob I have loaded, because when switching to X, 
even the sound gets distorted for a microsecond (the well-known the 
soundcard replays the sound buffer - no new data transferred to it).
Yeah, looks like something's keeping IRQ disabled for quite a while.
(My normal freq is 100 Hz + no preemption, if that makes any difference.)
I have not yet seen this on the free nv driver for Xorg or the (free) 
ati/Xorg. Same configuration (100 Hz, no preempt), though!
Does not really matter what userspace app is running. If it's mplayer the 
message is "rtc: lost some interrupts at 1024Hz.", and if it's VMware it's 
whatever the Guest OS requires, mostly 2000 or 200 Hz.
