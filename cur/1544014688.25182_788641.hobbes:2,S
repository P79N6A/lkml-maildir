Thanks!

I've not hit the OOM-kill issue under hierarchy so far, is the OOM
killer selecting a bad task to kill? I'll debug/reproduce the issue.
I am not posting these patches for inclusion, fixing bugs is
definitely the highest priority.

I run all my kernels and tests with lockdep enabled, I did not see any
lockdep errors showing up.

The idea behind adding the code in alloc_pages() is to detect
contention and trim mem cgroups down, if they have grown beyond their
soft limit

Yes, order > 1 is documented in the patch and you can see the code as
well. Your suggestion is to look at the gfp_mask as well, I'll do
that.

Sure, I'll do that in the next patchset.

Yes, that might be another point to experiment with, I'll try that in
the next iteration.

A very happy new year to you as well.
