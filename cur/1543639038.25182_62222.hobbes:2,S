It works like this:
	cpu1					cpu2
kill thread (on cpu2)
					complete_and_exit()
					- takes spinlock
wait_for_completion()
- spins on completion spinlock
					- increments x->done
					- wakes up anyone waiting on
					  the completion
					- releases spinlock
- checks x->done
- decrements x->done
- releases spinlock
OR:
	cpu1					cpu2
kill thread (on cpu2)
wait_for_completion()
- takes spinlock
					complete_and_exit()
					- spins on spinlock
- checks x->done
- adds to waitqueue
- releases spinlock
					- increments x->done
- sleeps
					- wakes up anyone waiting on
					  the completion
- wakes up
- spins on spinlock
					- releases spinlock
- decrements x->done
- releases spinlock
OR:
	cpu1					cpu2
kill thread (on cpu2)
wait_for_completion()
- takes spinlock
- checks x->done
- adds to waitqueue
- releases spinlock
- sleeps
					complete_and_exit()
					- takes spinlock
					- increments x->done
					- wakes up anyone waiting on
					  the completion
- wakes up
- spins on spinlock
					- releases spinlock
- decrements x->done
- releases spinlock
As you can see, wait_for_completion() will never return until complete()
has released the spinlock.
