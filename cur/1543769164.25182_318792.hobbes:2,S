Hello
http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~sbartels/alsa/driver/driver.html
 says
"For example, there is currently ongoing work to allow mixing multiple
inputs to the pcm devices."
Does ALSA already support software mixing? If I run xmms with alsa
output plugin and then mpg123 into it, I get 'can't open /dev/dsp'
message.
Kernel version is 2.6.11-gentoo-r5
