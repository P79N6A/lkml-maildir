Hello people,
This is probably nothing important, but I thought I'd post it anyway in
case it's of use to somebody.
I just checked my syslog and noticed these strange messages:
Aug 29 19:05:19 dustpuppy kernel: Unable to handle kernel paging request
at virtual address f006f004
Aug 29 19:05:19 dustpuppy kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 03d34000, %cr3 =

Aug 29 19:32:49 dustpuppy kernel: alloc_skb called nonatomically from
interrupt c0188061
Aug 29 19:32:49 dustpuppy kernel: alloc_skb called nonatomically from
interrupt c016d60d
I don't recall having any problems with my machine lately, so this
puzzels me.
The kernel I was running at the time was 2.2.13 (unfortunately I don't
have that specific kernel anymore - upgraded to 2.2.17).
My hardware is a IBM Thinkpad 600 - 233Mhz Pentium MMX with 64MB RAM.
I hope this is usefull to you guys!
BTW: Please CC me any replies to this, as I'm not on the list.
Best regards,
