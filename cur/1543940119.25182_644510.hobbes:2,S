I think it'd be really, REALLY helpful to a lot of people if you, or 
someone, could explain in moderate detail how this might be done. I 
tried doing it myself, but I'm not sufficiently expert at configuring 
kernels that I was ever able to figure out how to do it.
Obviously, the short version is: switch back to Fedora 6. But this kind 
of problem with libata---and yes, you're almost surely right that it's 
not one problem but lots---is sufficiently widespread that a Mini HOWTO, 
say, would be really welcome and, I'm guessing, widely used.
