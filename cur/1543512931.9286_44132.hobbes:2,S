	I do not know if it is relevant, but a friend of mine had a
	similar problem on a desktop PC (PIII 450, Asus P3BF, kernel
	2.2.5-22 or 2.2.10-ac10). Sometimes the machine was crashing
	(real crash) when the mouse was first moved (with GPM activated),
	sometimes he was able to launch X (we disabled GPM) and again
	the system was completely frozen as soon he moved the mouse.
	Not 100% reproducable, only 80% :-)
	Anyway, he bought a Logitech Serial mouse and unplugged
	his Logitech mouse from psaux port. It is now working fine.
	My guess is a broken BIOS on that card.
