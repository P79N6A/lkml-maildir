For gawd's sake.  You can make the kernel less buggy by removing SMP
support.
Guess what?  Tradeoffs exist.

You make it sound like this is a choice.  It isn't.  Nobody is going to go
in and convert all those filesystems.

I wouldn't characterise it as "arguing".  It's development.  Going and
sticking enormous slowdowns into write() to fix some bug which nobody is
hitting is insane.
We need to find a better fix, that's all.
