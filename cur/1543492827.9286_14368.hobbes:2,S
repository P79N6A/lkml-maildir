Interestingly, I'm writing this reply on a 2.2.5 compiled by egcs-2.93.17
(from CVS checked out at 1999/04/09 10:59:42 +0200), and I don't have any
problems (this is part of my .config: M586TSC, MTRR, IDEDMA, PACKET,
FIREWALL, MULTICAST, ALWAYS_DEFRAG, MASQUERADE, PPP, AIC7XXX, NCR53C8XX,
ETH, NE2K-PCI, ISDN, HISAX, AUTOFS, MINIX, EXT2, VFAT, UFS, NFS, SMBFS,
VGA/FB_VESA, MAGIC_SYSRQ):
Linux version 2.2.5 (manfred@saturn) (gcc version egcs-2.93.17 19990409 (gcc2 ss-980929 experimental)) #3 Sat Apr 10 10:57:24 MEST 1999
I do remember problems with a kernel compiled by an egcs snapshot a few
days earlier, though;  when LILO tried to load the kernel, the screen
went dark and nothing else.
IIRC, Jeff Law fixed some stuff wrt. loop unrolling which seem to have
cured my problem.
