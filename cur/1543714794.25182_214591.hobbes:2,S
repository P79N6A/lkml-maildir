Comments in  ChangeSet 1.1366 -> 1.1367  say:
# This adds all the SATA drivers except Intel ICH5/ICH6 ("ata_piix").
# ata_piix was the cause of all the ____request_resource() and PCI quirk
# nastiness.  As you can see, without that driver, the patch is nice and
# clean, and does nothing but add files.
Shall we people who can stand unclean and ugly trees have a separate
patch for ata_piix please ;))
