 Their docs imply just that.

 You are right.

 DU seems to map as low as possible, it would seem.  Maybe we could just
do the same for OSF/1 binaries by setting TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE
appropriately?

 Nope, see:
  The new region is placed at the requested address if the requested address
  is not null and it is possible to place the region at this address.  When
  the requested address is null or the region cannot be placed at the
  requested address, the MAP_VARIABLE and MAP_FIXED flags control the place-
  ment of the region.  One of these flags must be selected.
  If MAP_VARIABLE is set in the flags parameter:
    +  If the requested address is null or if it is not possible for the sys-
       tem to place the region at the requested address, the region is placed
       at an address selected by the system.
  If MAP_FIXED is set in the flags parameter:
[...]
We don't have MAP_VARIABLE but it's expands to zero in OSF/1 anyway.
