Hi,
Without ncurses installed, you should see these messages:
	echo " *** Unable to find the ncurses libraries."
	echo " *** make menuconfig require the ncurses libraries"
	echo " *** "
	echo " *** Install ncurses (ncurses-devel) and try again"
	echo " *** "
Do you not see them?  or do you need something different?
