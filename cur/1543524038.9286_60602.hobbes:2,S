Hi all
I'm debugging the 3c575_cb.c driver on my laptop, and have probably identified
the problem that makes it not work:  Interrupts seem to not get delivered.
It worked sort-of in 2.2.10, and it hasn't worked in the latest 2.3.4[01]
kernels.  I understand that there's been quite some changes in the cardbus
layer, so that's why I wanted the card to start working for real   :)
When the Tx ``thread'' calls the interrupt routine directly, the transmit queue
gets cleaned and the received packets get treated.  But I'm pretty sure that
the interrupt routine is _never_ called from the hardware IRQ (the printk()s in
there are never called).    Any suggestions as to what I could check ?
/proc/interrupts tells me there's been 22 interrupts on IRQ 8 which is used
solely by the NIC. A ping -f to the host doesn't make this number change.
I'm using the pcmcia package versions 3.1.8 and 3.1.9, but the kernel NIC
driver.
Btw. please CC: me as I only read the list archives.
Thank you,
