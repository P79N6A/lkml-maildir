@Alan, CJ, Pierre, Ori
Its a shame, after 5 years of Linux, my first post 
to the Kernel Mailinglist outs me as a dummy!!
Sorry thousand times for wasting your time!
Obviously it was the wrong processor type which 
caused the freeze.
But it has one really NIG advantage! I talked to 
the real Alan Cox Yippy.
I have to make some phonecallz...
thx and cu
