Rebuilding as an i486 isnt needed. It also lays the code out wrong for
the Cyrix CPU. Finally the later Cyrix chips do have an RDTSC including
the MediaGX. The MediaGX RDTSC just seems to do funny things at times
All of them work fine with the -ac1 and -ac2 patches. I didn't apply the
utterly bogus if (CPU > 486) rubbish from 2.2.0pre1 to my tree and it has
fixed CPU detection that also knows about dodgy TSC registers
