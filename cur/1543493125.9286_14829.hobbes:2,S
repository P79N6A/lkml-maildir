   I just posted the raw numbers and we are roughly twice as slow as
   solaris.
At least it is consistant with the fact that the solaris run had to
touch roughly half as much memory during the benchmark than Linux did.
Unfortunately, the touching of memory in lat_mmap() drains away a lot
of what it should be measuring (this I take part blame for as I was
one of the people that suggested to Larry to make it do this).
The problem is that we had to add this to avoid cases like Solaris
where the mapping state is not created at all if the process does not
touch any of the pages.  By touching the pages this would better
guarentee that both systems in question would have to set up (and
later, tear down) the same amount of state in the kernel.
But conversely, when the size of the area gets large, you begin to
test the memory speed moreso than the raw mmap/munmap latency of the
kernel.
Later,
