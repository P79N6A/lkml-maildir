Does pci_ids.h accept subsystem device ids too?

No, I don't. I use this fw returned structure to get the maximum IO size.

I don't look at any other values. Please see my comment above.

I will remove them.

I will convert them into inline functions. I didn't understand your comment
about "PCI posting flush". Are you referring to memory barriers?

You are saying I should use __le32 instead of u32 (our HW is little
endian) for all these data types. Have I understood you correctly?

Same driver runs on 2.4 kernels. These macros minimize the differences
between both versions.

Okay. I will make it an inline function.
