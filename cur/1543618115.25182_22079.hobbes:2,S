Thanks for the clarification, I run a few systems with such CPU's but
they don't exhibit the problem. I don't run Gentoo, just RH 7.(12) and
Debian Woody with recent 2.4 vanilla kernels, all of which run AGP, but
with a mix of ATI and Nvidia cards.

Well I saw this on LinuxToday before it hit slashdot (it was mostly
inaccessible after that).  Gentoo's explanation made sense, they claimed
to have spoken with Terrence Ripperda at Nvidia, Andrew Morton, and Alan
Cox. They also claimed this was a generic CPU bug affecting Linux -- the
same bug that was resolved with a workaround a year ago in Windows.
Unfortunately, the Technical note describing the Windows fix AMD
published is incredibly vague and doesn't specify if it is in fact a CPU
bug or some voodoo specific to Windows 2000.
Certainly there are some questions regarding the true impact of this bug
if any -- that's why I asked here. Slashdot reporting it just blows
things out of proportion. I wouldn't take Slashdot's word for anything,
but nor would I dismiss reports of problems out of hand just because
Slashdot picks up on it.

Reid
