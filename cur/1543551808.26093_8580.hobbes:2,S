Apply the relevant kernel debugger patch from
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/download/ix86/.
  Compile your kernel
with NMI oopser for uniprocessor, kdb and serial console.  Run a null
modem to a second machine (Documentation/serial-console.txt), capture
the output on the second machine.
Reproduce the problem.  If the machine is running at all then the NMI
oopser for UP will trip after 5 seconds, if the oopser does not trip
then enter control/A on the serial console.  In either case you can use
kdb over the serial console to see what the system is doing.  Odds are
it is spinning on a lock somewhere.
