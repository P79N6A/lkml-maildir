Andrea, look at the page_alloc() path, and the "don't loop forever if
__GFP_IO isn't set and we're not making progress". That looks entirely
sane.
It's the other limiting that I don't think really addresses the problem
(and I like your patch that removes some more magic limits - I suspect the
proper fix is the 5 lines from Rik's patch in page_alloc.c, and your patch
together - amybody mind testing that out?)
Oh, and I still _do_ think that we should rename the silly "async" flag as
"can_do_io", and then use that to determine whether to do SLAB_KERNEL or
SLAB_BUFFER. That would make more things able to do IO, which in turn
should help balance things out.
