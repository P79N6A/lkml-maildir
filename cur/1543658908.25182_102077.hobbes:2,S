No, this happens very reliably every time on a large number of occasions, whether 
trident is compiled in or as a module, or with ALSA's snd-ali5451. Dozens of read 
and write timeouts. In fact when the codec loads, it tends to freeze the whole 
system for a short time (from a few seconds to a minute).
That said, it's close to working. There have been times when I've been able to get 
sound -- typically by doing a manual insmod ac97_codec and trident. I had hoped the 
ALSA module would work more reliably, but it seems the problem is with the ac97 
codec.
Is the driver for the ac97 codec the same for OSS and ALSA? They appear to fail in 
very similar ways.
