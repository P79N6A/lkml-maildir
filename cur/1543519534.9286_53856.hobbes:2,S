Oh, the long command line problem is getting a partial fix, too.  For our
edification, could you send an actual command line that is getting chopped?
It will let me know if my fix sufficies, or if a deeper fix is needed.
(More of that "run on more than one machine" issue...)

while we are at the subject of bugs - 
a) ramdisk is still broken (there is a patch but not in the official
kernel)
b) e820 memory sizing is broken on Compaq Proliant/1600
c) long command lines (sometimes) get mysteriously chopped off
Regards,
Tigran.
