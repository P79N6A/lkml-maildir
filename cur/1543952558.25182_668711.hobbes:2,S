This is likely a missing volume setting.  With the upgrade to 2.6.25,
you may have a different mixer representation and the udev or init
script didn't restore the old mixer setting properly (typicall missing
-F option to alsactl).  Also note that aumix doesn't cover all volume
controls since it's an OSS app.
Anyway, there is too little hardware information here.  Please show
the output of alsa-info.sh:

In most cases, running the following commands solves the mixer issue:
	% amixer set Master unmute 80%
	% amixer set Front unmute 100%
	% amixer set Headphone unmute 100%
