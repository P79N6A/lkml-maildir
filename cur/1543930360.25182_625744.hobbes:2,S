It's a kmap_atomic() debugging patch which I wrote ages ago and whcih Ingo
sucked into his tree.  I don't _think_ this warning is present in your tree
at all.
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/29/157
 is where it starts.
I had a lenghty back-and-forth with Christoph on this within the past
couple of months and I cannot locate the thread and I don't recall what the
upshot was and Christoph is still offline.
Knocking out __GFP_ZERO at the point where the slab allocator(s) call the
page allocator seems like a good approach to me.
But I don't think we need to do anything for 2.6.24..
