I have a 350 here not running linux, that refuses to work with
Win95 or Win98 without locking up.  It has an MVP3 chipset and
32M of 66Mhz memory.  The board is clocked properly for the
processor and the memory is clocked for 66Mhz too.  I will try
and install Linux on it if people would apreciate my test
results.  Anyone interested?
Any suggestions other than getting PC100?
