hm, why isnt the synchronization done in switch_to()? Your arch-level 
switch_to() could have something like thread->last_cpu_sync, and if 
thread->last_cpu_sync != this_cpu, do the flush. This would not only 
keep this stuff out of the generic scheduler, but it would also optimize 
things a bit more: the moment we do a set_task_cpu() it does not mean 
that CPU _will_ run the task. Another CPU could grab that task later on.  
So we should delay such IO-synchronization to the last possible moment: 
when we know that we've hit a new CPU on which we havent done a flush 
yet. For same-CPU context switches there wouldnt be any extra 
synchronization, because thread->last_cpu_sync == this_cpu.
