Hi!
I've driver which essentially turns lucents winmodem into
soundcard. So - hardware interface was guessed and "only" remaining
part is doing v34 in software.
See discuss@linmodems.org archives for details.
Now, question is where should it go. That winmodem uses interrupts so
little that it can be nicely done using polling+userspace with zero
performance lost. Still it is device driver. Should it go into kernel?
[Well, drivers/sound/modem would be cool :-)]
Then, there's v34 stack. It is not written yet, but it will eventually
get written. It needs sort of realtime guarantees. Should it go into
kernel?
