Miles cleaned this up.

Hmph. Hardly seems any better...

Done.

It looked might it might be usefull elsewhere.

No, you don't want that.

It was a second allocator that more cleverly allocated large
memory chunks - not using the power of 2 allocator. I have
not carried this into the 2.5 patches. Very nice to have,
since you suffer much more from memory fragmentation without
VM. But not strictly neccessary, and to minimize and simplify
the current patch sets I left it out.
Cleanup out all references to it now.

Yes, no doubt the NO_MMU name is universally disliked :-)
Changed to COFNIG_LARGE_ALLOCS now.

Fixed.

This isn't old. It is the primary format used on uClinux. ELF
and a.out are not practical, since you would need to do the final
link/locate on them at exec load time (you won't know what address
in memory they will get loaded to until them). You don have the
VM luxary of just locating it at a fixed address at compile time.
FLAT format is a light weight, mostly architecture independant
way to carry around relocs, and to keep the program binaries
small.

Another "feature" I have not carried into 2.5. Removed.
Thanks
