I think vmfs is the better choice.  Not to be gratuitously
incompatable with sun, but there is no guarentee linux's
implementation and sun's will be or remain compatable, so it really
doesn't hurt to choose a name which is more descriptive rather than
that used by someone else's product -- even if the other product is
widely deployed and understood.

Unquestionably the Right Thing.  VM is after all being measured, and
RAM is always measured in binary.  (OK, I just *know* someone will
provide a counter-example disproving that assertion -- perhaps the old
36 bit systems?  Or core?  But are there any modern counter-examples?)
