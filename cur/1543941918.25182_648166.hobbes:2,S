The iSER spec (RFC-5046) quotes the following in the TCP case for direct
data placement:
"  Out-of-order TCP segments in the Traditional iSCSI model have to be
   stored and reassembled before the iSCSI protocol layer within an end
   node can place the data in the iSCSI buffers.  This reassembly is
   required because not every TCP segment is likely to contain an iSCSI
   header to enable its placement, and TCP itself does not have a
   built-in mechanism for signaling Upper Level Protocol (ULP) message
   boundaries to aid placement of out-of-order segments.  This TCP
   reassembly at high network speeds is quite counter-productive for the
   following reasons: wasted memory bandwidth in data copying, the need
   for reassembly memory, wasted CPU cycles in data copying, and the
   general store-and-forward latency from an application perspective."
While this does not have anything to do directly with the kernel vs. user discussion
for target mode storage engine, the scaling and latency case is easy enough
to make if we are talking about scaling TCP for 10 Gb/sec storage fabrics.

>From looking at this problem from a kernel space perspective for a
number of years, I would be inclined to believe this is true for
software and hardware data-path cases.  The benefits of moving various
control statemachines for something like say traditional iSCSI to
userspace has always been debateable.  The most obvious ones are things
like authentication, espically if something more complex than CHAP are
the obvious case for userspace.  However, I have thought recovery for
failures caused from communication path (iSCSI connections) or entire
nexuses (iSCSI sessions) failures was very problematic to expect to have
to potentially push down IOs state to userspace.
Keeping statemachines for protocol and/or fabric specific statemachines
(CSM-E and CSM-I from connection recovery in iSCSI and iSER are the
obvious ones) are the best canidates for residing in kernel space.

Most of the SCSI OS storage subsystems that I have worked with in the
context of iSCSI have used 256 * 512 byte setctor requests, which the
default traditional iSCSI PDU data payload (MRDSL) being 64k to hit the
sweet spot with crc32c checksum calculations.  I am assuming this is
going to be the case for other fabrics as well.
