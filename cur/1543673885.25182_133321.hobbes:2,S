Hi Jeff and Dave,
I posted this in response to Linus's release of 2.5.69 but I don't know
if either of you saw it.
The patches for the Broadcom net driver (tg3) did not fix the problem
I've had with the ASUS A7V8X motherboard which has a Broadcom gigabit
ethernet chip built in.
The problem remains the same:  to get the chip to process packets I
first must do an ifconfig down/up cycle after I reboot the machine,
even though there are no error messages from any of the initscripts
during bootup and the output from ifconfig looks perfect.
Once I do the down/up the Broadcom chip works well until the next reboot,
when the same problem shows up again.  The Broadcom chip apparently is
not fully initialized and winds up in some furshluginner state until
another ifconfig down/up is done.
If I can supply any debugging info please let me know!
Thanks.
