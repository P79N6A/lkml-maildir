I've been noticing a similar problem on my laptop. This may, or may
not be related, but it did start somewhere within the past week (maybe
the IDE taskfile conversion???, to throw out a guess). I wonder if
Dave Jones is using IDE or SCSI. CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT are
disabled on my machine (Sony Vaio PCG-FXA49 laptop, Athlon4). I'm
compiling the kernel with gcc 3.3 (Debian version).
Anyway, certain directories get locked up on occasion and when I try
to execute 'ls' or read from the directory, the process gets into a
locked up state; ^C does not work to kill the process. The only way to
make a directory "readable" is to restart the machine. I have not
noticed any FS corruption, just the lack of being able to enter the
directory.
 At the same time, a kernel bug will be displayed:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
