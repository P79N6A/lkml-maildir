Subject: multiple sb missing in 2.2?

Here's a problem that I searched nearly everywhere an answer to
before thinking about posting it to the busy people that subscribed
to the kernel mailing list :-)
I want to setup two soundcards to work at the same time with
the 2.2.x (I use the newest) kernel.
The cards are a sbawe32 and a sbvibra16c. 
I read about problems with the vibra but I had none with 2.0.35/36 or 
ALSA.
With 2.0.35/36 I could use this setup, it was described in a 
(Sound)HOWTO,
but now with modular sound the sb.o doesn't want to take the two dma's 
of the
second card.
The isapnp-setup is working fine but:
how should I load the modules?
modprobe sb io=0x220 io2=0x240 dma=1,3 dma16=5,6 mpu_io=0x330
or similar arguments don't work.
It seems that sb.o only wants two: dma and dma16.
where should I give the other ones and the second io?
is this setup possible with 2.2?
please can someone give an answer or only a link where this procedure is
described?  I don't want to miss multitracking/duplex in 2.2 :-)
