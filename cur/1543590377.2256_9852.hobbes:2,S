I've noticed that alloc_kiovec() calls alloc_kiobuf_bhs(), which...

...where KIO_MAX_SECTORS is currently 1024.  This makes a kiobuf quite a
heavy-weight object to allocate and free.  
Was this high-overhead initialisation left in because kiobufs shouldn't be
allocated and freed at the drop of a hat in any case?
If not, allocating the kiobuf->bh[i], could be delayed until the number
required is known.
This would be beneficial for direct I/O in the scsi generic driver, which
currently allocates and frees a kiobuf on each read/write.
