But you would add the flush_icache_page_chprot to address that.

And it is also broken, because it needs to be done before the set_pte
for ia64. It needs to be done where flush_icache_page is done. And on
ia64 it flushes the icache. So I don't understand why ia64 would not
use flush_icache_page but add something completely new "because it is
more generic".

There is just no point in adding something else if you already have
a hook that seems to do what ia64 wants (or could, with a small amount
of work).
