No, because we reserved memory for n objects, and like matt illustrates
most of those that will be eaten by the greedy process.
We could reserve 1 page per object but that rather bloats the reserve.

I tried to slim it down to a two state affair; but last time I tried
performance runs that actually slowed it down some.
