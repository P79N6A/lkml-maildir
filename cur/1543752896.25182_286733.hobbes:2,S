I'm actually trying to find bugs in Valgrind's memory map tracking code,
but so far all the problems have been in /proc/self/maps (which I had
been treating as a golden reference...).
I'll give this a go shortly.  
BTW, your last patch fixed the >4k read problem, so I'm hoping this will
be the last one.
