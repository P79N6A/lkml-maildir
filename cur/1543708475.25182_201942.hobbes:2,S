Hi,
I tried this, but the problem still occurs.
Ok, here's a explanation of what I did:
1. I started xmms and started playing something (NOTE!!!: This doesn't
seem to matter at all, because I just tried without it and 3. still
hangs.)
2. I started TeamSpeak2
3. I started Quake3, Quake3 hangs.
So where could the problem occur?
There's no messages anywhere, no error messages anywhere.
I wonder if it matters if ALSA with it's oss things are compiled in?
(Not as module?)
