Subject: [GIT PATCH] another SCSI critical bug fix for 2.6.24-rc6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/4/251

They just keep coming out of the woodwork, sorry.  This one's in the
SCSI over RDMA Protocol transport class, so it's causing SCSI over
infiniband installations to oops on shutdown.  I'm told that their are
now nearly as many SCSI over IB users as their are voyager users, so,
since it's nearly mainstream, we need to fix the problem urgently ...
The patch is available here:
master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-rc-fixes-2.6.git
I've just attached it below as well.

Subject: [SCSI] SRP transport: only remove our own entries
The SCSI SRP transport class currently iterates over all children
devices of the host that is being removed in srp_remove_host(). However,
not all of those children were created by the SRP transport, and
removing them will cause corruption and an oops when their creator tries
to remove them.
