I *thought* mutt had a patch which sorted the files returned by
readdir() by inode number, and then opened the files sorted by inode
number order; maybe it was a distro-specific patch that was never
pushed back to mainline, though.  In any case, sorting list of
directory entries as returned by readdir() by inode number does solves
the problem for ext3 with htree, and in general is a good optimization
for most filesystems.  (See attached for a ld-preload hack that
demonstrates the optimization.)
There is also a fix in ext4 which partially addresses this problem,
which could be back-ported to ext3:

    ext4: Use readahead when reading an inode from the inode table
    With modern hard drives, reading 64k takes roughly the same time as
    reading a 4k block.  So request readahead for adjacent inode table
    blocks to reduce the time it takes when iterating over directories
    (especially when doing this in htree sort order) in a cold cache case.
    With this patch, the time it takes to run "git status" on a kernel
    tree after flushing the caches via "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
    is reduced by 21%.
