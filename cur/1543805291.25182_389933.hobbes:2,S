Now you're unfair.
-scanbus does a nice output of what cdwriters (and other capable devices) 
are present. For me, that lists the cd writer and a CF slot from the 
multitype usb flash reader.
There's one kind of not-so-advanced linux newbies that just go to walmart, 
buy a computer and whack a linux system on it for fun, and they still don't 
know if their cdrom is at /dev/hdb or /dev/hdc. Looking for dmesg is 
usually a nightmare for them, and apart that -scanbus lists scsi 
host,id,lun instead of /dev/hd* (don't comment on this kthx), it is 
convenient for this sort of users to find out what's available.
So, and what about that compactflash reader? It is subject to dynamic 
usb->scsi device association (depending on when you connect it, it may 
either become sda, or sdb, or sdc, etc.), and -scanbus yet again provides 
some way (albeit not useful, because it lists scsi,id,lun rather than 
/dev/sd* - don't comment either) to see where it actually is.
