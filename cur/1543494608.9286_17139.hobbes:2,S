  Hi, all. Version 15 of my MSR patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
Some documentation is also available here.
The patch provides user space access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
and Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) via device driver interfaces.
The patch also includes a crude page colouring algorithm (off by
default).
NOTE: The patch requires my devfs and MTRR patches. First apply the
MTRR patch and then the devfs patch. The devfs patch will have two
failures which should be ignored.
This is against 2.2.7+mtrr+devfs. Highlights of this release:
- Remove MTRR changes (see MTRR patch instead)
				Regards,
					Richard....
