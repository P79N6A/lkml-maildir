At this point, there's not much to do besides program and find bugs; the 
documentation that needs writing has to be written by a programmer.
One thing you could do is, um, test new kernels.  For instance, you could
install Red Hat 6.1, then download the latest 2.3 kernel, build it using the
recommended compiler (is gcc 2.95 allowed yet?), then run your favorite apps
on it.  If you're afraid to run normal apps on it, you could run crashme on 
it.  
Crashme will search for crash bugs.  You can download it at 
http://ring.iwate-pu.ac.jp/pub/linux/debian/debian/dists/unstable/main/source/
devel/crashme_2.4.orig.tar.gz
or 
http://ftp.lip6.fr/pub3/linux/Sparc/crashme/crashme-2.4-shar.gz
Forward the first crash bug you find to this list, and someone will try to
repeat and fix it.
