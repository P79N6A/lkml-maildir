	Hi James,
These patches add support for m68k to the 53c700 SCSI core and introduce new
drivers for various m68k hardware using this 53c700 SCSI core, to replace the
just removed drivers using the old 53c7xx SCSI core.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
