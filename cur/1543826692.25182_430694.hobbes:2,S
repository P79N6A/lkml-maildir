How do you intend to connect your device to the DDC channel if there's
already a monitor connected to the VGA or DVI port?
Beware that many monitors have EDID EEPROMs responding to all I2C
addresses within the 0x50 - 0x57 range, so it'll be hard to add an
EEPROM on the bus for your own purpose without hitting an address
conflict.

The current trend is to merge the DDC access driver into the
framebuffer driver. This solves one of the conflicts, and also makes
sense because the EDID data can be used to automatically setup the
framebuffer. We still have a few standalone DDC access drivers
(i2c-i810, i2c-savage4...) but they are considered deprecated and will
probably be deleted in a near feature.
This will be a second problem for you though. Most distributions don't
make use of hardware-specific framebuffer drivers by default, but use
the VESA framebuffer driver. This driver doesn't have DDC support.
Note that I am not trying to dicourage you, Andy's idea has merit for
sure. I just mean that it won't be usable by everyone out of the box.
People will have to use the right driver and pay attention to address
conflicts.
