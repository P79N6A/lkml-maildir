(I had noted in another email that tip/master still had the problem.)
However, with latest Linus' git tree (2.6.29-rc1-00224-ga652504),
I no longer see the error messages I had noted before.  Instead I now see:
[  475.132031] agpgart-amd64 0000:00:00.0: AGP 3.0 bridge
[  475.132056] agpgart-amd64 0000:00:00.0: putting AGP V3 device into 8x mode
[  475.132123] pci 0000:01:00.0: putting AGP V3 device into 8x mode
[  475.502856] [drm:radeon_do_init_cp] *ERROR* could not find ioremap agp regions!
Is this related?  I added Dave Airlie to the CC since perhaps he would be the one
to ask about it?
Thanks,
