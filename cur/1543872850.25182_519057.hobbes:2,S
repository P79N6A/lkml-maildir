I agree. C99 standard just says:
6.3.2.3 Pointers
"3  An integer constant expression with the value 0, or such an
expression cast to type void *, is called a null pointer constant. If
a null pointer constant is converted to a pointer type, the resulting
pointer, called a null pointer, is guaranteed to compare unequal to a
pointer to any object or function."
