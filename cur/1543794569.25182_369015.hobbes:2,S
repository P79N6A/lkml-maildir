Welcome to sendpatchset - cool.
(Nick is now using sendpatchset:
    
http://www.speakeasy.org/~pj99/sgi/sendpatchset
 to send these patches, so they are inline.)
Now ... if you use sendpatchset to send the entire set at once, and
(even fancier) number them "01/12" instead of "1/12", we will see these
patches in the order you numbered them, instead of in the order you
apparently sent them: 11, 7, 8, 9, 12, 4, 2, 1, 5, 10 (with 3 and 6
still outstanding).
Your single sendpatchset control file would include lines something
like:
    subj [patch 00/12] mm: optimisations
    file optimisations.txt
    subj [patch 01/12] mm: free_pages_and_swap_cache opt
    file patches/free_pages_and_swap_cache-opt
    subj [patch 02/12] mm: pagealloc opt
    file patches/pagealloc-opt
    subj [patch 03/12] mm: something-or-other
    file patches/something-or-other
    subj [patch 04/12] mm: set_page_refs opt
    file patches/set_page_refs-opt
    ...
