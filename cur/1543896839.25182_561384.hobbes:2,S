argh.  (and not just argh-at-your-email-client).
I went through some hair-tearing a few months ago working out why it is so
damn hard to make CONFIG_PM go away and then I fixed it.  And now you're
proposing a change which would reinstate the obnoxious old behaviour.
Is the "bug" which you're "fixing" here caused by the randconfig
inadequacies?  Because randconfig is just busted and simply should auto-run
oldconfig.
