Folks,
 The forward ported changes from 2.4 -> 2.5 for reiserfs
in my tree are nearly entirely hand merged by myself.
Whilst I've tested them with no problems, I'd prefer that
some of the reiserfs guys take a look at what I've done to
make sure I've not screwed up something obscure before I start
pushing this to Linus.
Jumbo patch as always is at...

Dave.
