As I understand the protocol the userspace task writes it's pid into the
lock atomically when locking it and erases it atomically when it leaves
the lock. If it is killed inbetween the pid is still there.
Now if another task comes along it reads the pid, sets the wait flag and goes 
into the kernel. The kernel will now be able to see that the pid is no
longer valid and therefore the owner must be dead.
