I general I like to try and beat on the new kernels to try and find
bugs...  I just started trying to use the 2.4.0-preX kernels.  My first
Kernel Build just fine.  Every single compile after that has died on the
final linking  with this error:
 drivers/char/char.o: In function `analog_decode':
drivers/char/char.o(.text+0x18afa): undefined reference to `input_event'
drivers/char/char.o(.text+0x18b34): undefined reference to `input_event'
drivers/char/char.o(.text+0x18b72): undefined reference to `input_event'
drivers/char/char.o(.text+0x18baa): undefined reference to `input_event'
drivers/char/char.o(.text+0x18be5): undefined reference to `input_event'
drivers/char/char.o(.text+0x18c1f): more undefined references to
`input_event' follow
drivers/char/char.o: In function `analog_init_device':
drivers/char/char.o(.text+0x197be): undefined reference to
`input_register_device'
drivers/char/char.o: In function `analog_disconnect':
drivers/char/char.o(.text+0x19f9e): undefined reference to
`input_unregister_device'
I must be doing something stupid.  I tried searching the list but none of
the search engines that I found were really getting me anywhere.  I
checked the list of needed upgrades and I seem to be up to date on
everything that I use. I have tried both 2.4.0-pre5 and 2.4.0-pre6...  I
am enabling usb with usb-storage, devfs, and the hot-plug stuff...  I
think this is pretty much the only new stuff that I am using...
On the one compile that did build I had some tramatic devfs experiances (I
didn't RTFM -- oops...  Leason learned yet again)  I did get past that and
got devfsd up which seemed to fix almost everything.  My problems were
A) Keyboard didn't respond (telneted in to work on it)
B) tcsh is segfaulting!  I can't even logon to an account which has tcsh
	as the default shell (bash does work)
C) SanDisk usb flash card reader (the -09 version)  didn't work (though
	from poking around it seems this is in a state of major 
	developement)
D) eth0 (a dec tulip) takes an extrodinarily long time to dhcp now.  It
	eventualy works but it doesn't seem happy.
