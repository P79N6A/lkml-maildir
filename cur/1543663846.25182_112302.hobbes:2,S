You mention sparc - have you tested if that works on sparc?
ptrace_readdata assumes that addr2 is a pointer to kernel space, not 
user space. It works by chance on i386, but that's not acceptable for 
merging.
You must double buffer, check mem_read in fs/proc/base.c

I assume you mean /proc/<pid>/mem. Performance is identical, same 
implementation.
