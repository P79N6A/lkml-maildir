First thing to do is to use a known to be stable compiler (you didn't
specify which version you were using). Second, run a UP kernel on a UP
system.
The BUG! in page_alloc. is normally due to memory corruption, often
because of hardware problems or maybe because the compiler you use
over optimizes things.
