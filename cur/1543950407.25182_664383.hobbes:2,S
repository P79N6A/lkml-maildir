Seems a little redundant with the boot log, but ok.
But it's unclear to the user which apic ID is meant by that. There are
two different ones. The one in the LAPIC mapping and the one reported by
CPUID. They are not necessarily the same. I think you should clarify that
by renaming the field or perhaps report both.
