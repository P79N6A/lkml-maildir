set_page_dirty() is actually called fairly late in the game by
zap_pte_range() and follow_page().  Thus, it is a notification that a page
HAS BEEN dirtied and needs a writeback.
What is needed (at least for log structured or copy-on-write filesystems) is
a function that is called during the page fault BEFORE the pte's writeable
bit is set so that the pages' mapping can either be unmapped or remapped. 
That prevents possible readers of the old (read-only) version of the page
from seeing any changes via the page map cache.  If the page was unmapped, a
second call is needed later to map it to a new set of blocks on the device. 
For a log structured filesystem it can makes sense to defer the remapping
until late in the game when the block is about to be queued for i/o, in case
it gets deleted before it is ever flushed from the page cache.
I looked at using set_page_dirty for the first of these hooks, but it comes
too late.  It might be OK for the second (remapping) hook though.
do_wp_page() is called by handle_pte_fault() in exactly the case where this
would apply: if write access is needed and !pte_write(entry).  This patch
appears to address the necessary issue in a way that set_page_dirty cannot.
