Subject: [PATCH] alpha: csum_partial_copy bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a bug in csum_partial_cfu_src_aligned where if len is a multiple of
8, an extra quadword would be read from src, which would break when that
happens to cross a page boundary.
The following patch fixes this.  It also removes the len & 7 check from
csum_partial_cfu_unaligned since if len < 0, we can deduce that -7 < len < -1
so the check will always succeed.
