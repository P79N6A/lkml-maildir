oh ... i definitely have to read the Documentation/files more often for 
updates... last time i did, i didn't remember seeing proc magic in this 
one. 
is somebody keeping a online version of the kernel source docs (i mean the 
Documentation/* files) somewhere for surfing? i want to point people to 
pages with links without forcing them to download the sources to read 
what i tell them to.
often i'm asked questions about linux in general. an updated docs pages on 
the net would be helpful. of course if it does not exist, i can create 
one, but why re-inventing the wheel if it is easier to give credits to 
the first person who invented it and use it? ;-)
thanx + greetings,
Damir
