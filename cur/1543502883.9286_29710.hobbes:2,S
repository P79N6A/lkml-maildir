You should only get this message if you are trying to spoof the
server.  The message is given if you can't get from the filehandle
dentry to the export dentry by following dentry->parent.
Could it be that dentrys are being expired between the filehandle
and the export?
From the path that is printed it looks stranger though.
You might want to print the dentries in `nfsfh.c' on line 1395 with
this patch.
