We have not heard about digsig before, thanks for pointing it out. After a
short look over the source (correct me if I'm wrong): The most important
difference between our project and digsig is that digsig relies on storing
signatures inside the ELF file structure. Therefore a handmade binary-loader or
just COFF binaries could be used to circumvent digsig. We decided against
altering the file itself for that and some other reasons.
The limitation to suid/sgid was only due to a limited amount of time we had for
implementing our patch. For the future we are planning further uses like
setting capabilities only for signed binaries.

Our scenario was as follows: Usually system administrators rely on cronjobs
checking their binaries for unwanted suid-bits. Because of the obvious problems
with this (time between cronjobs, performance) we wrote our patch to replace it.
An admin would verify the to-be-installed binaries (e.g. by reading the source,
checking the distribution's package signatures), sign them in a central
location.  He then distributes those signatures along with the installation
packages onto his computers. There should only be one key in use at a site the
public part of which is compiled into the kernel. Any kind of chain-of-trust
should be handled in userspace by signing or not signing with the site-wide
key depending on the earlier signatures in the chain.
So far for the initial idea. Perhaps it would be useful to have more than one
key or some more complex scheme for obtaining the keys and checking their
validity.  But as all of this would need to be part of the kernel we decided to
rather keep it as simple as possible, anything complex is better and more
flexibly done in userspace.

We do realize that this is really really ugly, broken and nasty and nobody
would or should ever want to use it for anything but playing around as it is
atm. ;)
We only used HMAC because it was already available inside the kernel, for
implementing real asymetric cryptography there was simply no time. Of course
our next objective is to implement that.
