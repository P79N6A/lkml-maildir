I throw the lockless patch and Jens splice-bench into our benchmark harness,
here are the numbers I collected, on the following hardware:
(1) 2P Intel Xeon, 3.4 GHz/HT, 2M L2
(2) 4P Intel Xeon, 3.0 GHz/HT, 8M L3
(3) 4P Intel Xeon, 3.0 GHz/DC/HT, 2M L2 (per core)
Here are the graph:
(1) 2P Intel Xeon, 3.4 GHz/HT, 2M L2

(2) 4P Intel Xeon, 3.0 GHz/HT, 8M L3

(3) 4P Intel Xeon, 3.0 GHz/DC/HT, 2M L2 (per core)

(4) everything on one graph:
