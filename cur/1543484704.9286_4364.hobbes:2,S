Cyrix CPUs are not sold by the actual speed of the core -- they use a
'performance rating' or 'Pentium rating', hence the PR233 instead of 233MHz.
IIRC, the PR233 does in fact run around 187.5MHz, so the detection is pretty
close.  PR233 is supposed to indicate that it will keep up to a Pentium 233,
which it mostly will as long as you don't do any floating point work.  Chalk
it up to marketroids.
