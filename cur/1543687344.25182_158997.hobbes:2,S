Hmm.  You can't do this if the end host does the ESP (AH is another 
matter).  Ever.  If the ESP is working, the router can't tell what is 
inside the packet; this is the whole point of IPSEC.  If you want this 
functionality, you can only provide it on the end host, or else do the 
IPSEC on the router.

You can't, by design of IPSEC.  However, you do have a couple of options:
1) let through IPSEC only for hosts you trust
2) for hosts you must firewall at the router, do the IPSEC there too, and 
do not allow those hosts to use IPSEC.
These aren't exclusive.

You're welcome.
