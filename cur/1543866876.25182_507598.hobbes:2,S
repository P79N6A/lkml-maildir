Ok. I don't feel like I have to convince everyone :)

I'm not sure. I don't use encryption myself, so I don't understand all
the fine details. I just know that there are people out there using
encryption, loop-aes, dmsetup and all that sort of stuff. I don't have
to worry about it because they use an initrd/ramfs to do whatever they
need to do to provide access to the device on which the image is found,

Neither am I! Presumably you'd have a lot more than emacs in there
though :) You could always switch to vim! (*ducks*)
