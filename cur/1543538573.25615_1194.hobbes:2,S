Another advantage of getting rid of the fixed arrays is that in the future
we may be able to hot-add/remove proc's without running into array size
problems.  Note that removing processors physically and deconfiguring them
from the kernel dynamically looks about the same from the kernels
perspective... 
Just something to keep in mind.  :)
