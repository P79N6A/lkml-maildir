Hi
I use the Kernel 2.2.10, and when I want to load the module hisax for my
Fritz!PCI I´ve got this message on the screen:

I use the SuSE Linux 6.0, but they say that they only can give support
for the SuSE Kernel, so I ask you. In the kernel 2.0.36 the Fritz!PCI
works without any problems, but i want to use it with the kernel 2.2.10,
too. Can you say me what I made wrong ?? At the end of my E-Mail you
find the configuration of my kernel.
Thanks for your help
Daryl
P.S.: I hope my english isn´t to awful
