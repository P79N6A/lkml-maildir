Okay, that part I misread from the message, but that leaves the question of 
"does it work?"  Iirc, Jeff Merkey tested variable sized ios with nwfs, but 
found that triggered bugs in the low level drivers, some of which assume that 
all buffer heads within a request have the same block size.  Given that 
concern, I really don't think this is a safe 2.4 patch.
