Great!
Knowing this makes the path clear.
As we expected, an automatic workaround based on chip-set would
fail because some BIOS's are fixed and some are not.
So we either leave the workaround as manual bootparam
or try to enumerate all BIOS versions with the bug
in dmi_scan.  I'm content to do the former.  If distros
have trouble supporting nforce2 systems, they may want to add
to the later.
thanks,

ps.
I'm also excited to see a linux-nforce-bugs@exchange.nvidia.com alias
on your note.  Perhaps you can explain how we should use it.  Should
this alias be included on discussions of the more important issue --
the system hang that seems to be related to HALT in idle/C1?
