Reasonable for those who can afford to get their hard disks trashed
whilst the bugs are being worked out. I'll wait until it's finished,
thank you...
On the other hand, I have plenty of floppies I can afford to trash,
and I usually leave a trashable floppy in the drive as they're much
quieter that way, at least on the machine in my bedroom...
Best wishes from Riley.
