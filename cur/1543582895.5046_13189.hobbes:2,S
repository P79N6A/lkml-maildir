As other posts have pointed out, if you have BAD HDMA cables, you will 
experience problems.  One thing I would suggest is that you 
add  kernel.*        /dev/console to your /etc/syslog.conf so that you see 
any errors resulting from the kernel code.  Also I would suggest that you 
open another virtual terminal and leave tail -f /var/log/messages and keep 
an eye on it when the system could possibly crash.  This should help you 
out a little bit.
