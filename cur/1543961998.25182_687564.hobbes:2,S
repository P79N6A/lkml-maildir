Not at the moment, but there may be a way to do that if we think of it more
thoroughly.
One idea may be add a "Commented-by:" tag in which to place people who
provided valuable comments to the patch author and/or maintainer (as a comma
separated list, for example, in analogy with the email Cc lists), especially if
the patch has been changed as a result of the comments.
