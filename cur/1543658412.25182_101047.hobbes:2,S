Last time I saw calibrating delay loop problems, it just mean the other CPUs
weren't getting / acting upon IPIs. I might expect that on NUMA-Q, but the
INIT, INIT, STARTUP sequence on normal machines should kick the remote proc
pretty damned hard and reset it. You might want to add more APIC resetting
things (I think there are some in there that only NUMA-Q does right now ..
try turning those on).
