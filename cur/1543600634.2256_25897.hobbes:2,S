Hmm. And if two openers have the device open at the same time? One dirties
data after the first one has done __block_fsync? And the truncate will
throw the dirtied page away?
Now, I don't think we need to be _too_ careful about cache coherency: it's
probably ok to do something like
	__block_fsync(dev) - sync _our_ changes
	invalidate_inode_pages(dev) - this will only invalidate unused pages
	invalidate_device(dev)
But I'd just like to feel really comfortable about it. And part of that is
probably to be simpler rather than be clever..
