If the "most systems" refers to Unices, remember that those people have
full control of hardware and software. Not the case of an OS that mostly
runs on kludged together pieces that have to keep semantics of a broken
design made of utter crap parts from the late 70's. And the idea of dumping
kernel core on panic makes me shiver...

AFAIK, BIOSes on PCs clear all RAM on boot. Besides, there are the poor
souls who have to boot via syslinux, ntldr or other non-native methods.
