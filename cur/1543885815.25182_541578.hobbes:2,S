Looks more complex than necessary.  Why do you want to execute
an arch specific script to list the __IGNORE symbols?  That would
allow an arch to generate a list with sed/perl/etc. but that
looks like overkill.
If you just have an arch specific file with the right defines.
E.g. for x86_64 in include/asm-x86_64/ignore_syscalls:
#include __IGNORE_getcpu
Then the checksyscalls.sh changes would just be something like
(do I need a ${srctree} before the include??):
diff --git a/scripts/checksyscalls.sh b/scripts/checksyscalls.sh
index f98171f..616f7c5 100755
