Great, please let us know.  Your device list looks simple, I don't see
why this would happen (no confusing devices).  In fact, this is getting
triggered by the root hub, which Alan's update specifically addresses by
not making that be multithreaded, as it's not needed.
I'll work on intergrating that patch update.
