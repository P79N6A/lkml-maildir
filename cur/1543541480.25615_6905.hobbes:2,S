Hi folks!
Did anyone try to use inn on linux-2.4? I tried to use inn-{1.7.2,2.2.2}
on kernels 2.4.0-test1-ac7, -test{5,6} and hit a bug. I got wrong
.overview files, disappearing articles, wrong active file (what I
think was the cause of others). I can't understand how it can be. The
bug has never been seen on 2.2 kernels. It looks as not garbage, but
wrong hi&low marks in active file.
