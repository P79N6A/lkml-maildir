Either they are rare and you can wrap them and still use 80 columns,
or it turns out they are not so rare and you may want to use wider
windows (not necessarily 132 but perhaps 100).
I think the question isn't if they are rare or not, or if people have
3 * 1920 pixels/line or just 1280.
The question is: is the code more readable with hard limit equal to 80
characters, or maybe is it better to limit code block complexity
instead, and let the maximum number of those small pictures in a line
alone? (Limiting at 132 would have technical sense IMHO).
Better code readability = less bugs without any additional
effort.

Sure - because email is not C code.
Actually you don't "read" C code, word by word, as you read books - do
you?
