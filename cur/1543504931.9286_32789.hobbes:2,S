Hi,
    I have a 2.2.10 rh6 system at home. I have applied the international
kernel patches for 2.2.10. I have recompiled, and, YES, the correct
kernel is running. I have also applied the util-linux patch to the
util-linux from the SRPM file and only installed "losetup" from the
recompiled util-linux sources  from there into /sbin/losetup. My problem
is the following:
[root@periscope mastersj]# losetup -e rc6 /dev/loop0 /dev/hdb4
Password :
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument
[root@periscope mastersj]#
Here's the ouput of "losetup" (which confirms it was rebuilt):
[root@periscope mastersj]# losetup
usage:
  losetup loop_device                                      # give info
  losetup -d loop_device                                   # delete
  losetup [ -e encryption ] [ -o offset ] loop_device file # setup
    where encryption is one of:
       no
       none
       xor
       DES
       twofish
       blowfish
       cast128
       serpent
       mars
       rc6
       dfc
       idea
Thanks.
