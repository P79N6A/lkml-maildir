But then we added the dma_map_* API, which only gets the struct device
pointer but needs to do something different depending on what type of
bus the device is on, and possibly even depending on which instance of
its bus type it's on...
If we are going to have APIs like this that work on a struct device,
then we need to have some good way to know what type of bus the device
is on, and what code we need to call to manipulate that bus type.
