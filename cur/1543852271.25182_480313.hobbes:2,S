Hello World,
my Wacom Volito2 tablet doesn't work with the kernel driver as it is. 
The cursor jitters about at the bottom of the screen in a useless 
manner. However, if I edit drivers/usb/input/wacom_wac.c and change the 
two instances of wacom_be16_to_cpu to wacom_le16_to_cpu then it works 
perfectly
sed -i 's/_b/_l/' drivers/usb/input/wacom_wac.c
