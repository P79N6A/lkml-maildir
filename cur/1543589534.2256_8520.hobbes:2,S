See: 
http://www.kvaser.se
We will contact Kvaser to get the technical Specification. I cannot 
guarantee that we will be allowed to publish it, but if we are and you 
are interrested, i can send you a link when and if we get it.

We have no influence on the card itself, I'm afaid. But we will stridt 
to make it very easy to change the hardware driver.
The driver we want to implement, is actually several drivers.
Since the CANBus is a bus, it is natual (for us) to implement it as 
such, so that it will be possible to load drivers on top of the hardware 
driver, which can communicate with specific hardware on the bus.

I'm still very interrested.
