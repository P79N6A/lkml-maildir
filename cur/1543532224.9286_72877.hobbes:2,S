Pavel,
Oh Yeah, and I almost forgot.  Remember those emails I sent you 6 months
ago. The one's asking for your help with creating an md driver for the
NetWare mirroring so I didn't have to replicate a NetWare style LRU so I
could tightly integrate NWFS with the Linux Buffer Cache and md (in
fact, I even was willing to give you the nwvp code and sent it to you so
you could put it into the current RAID driver)?
Did you ever respond.   NO ......
How many emails did I send you?   Was it seven or eight?
Did you answer any of them.  NO .......
If you are still interested in doing what I suggested, unlike you, I
will answer your emails and help you take over the code (and let you
control it for Linux) so Linux will be able to enter Novell's market
with a tighter implementation.
Think about it ......
:-) :-) :-).
Touche .....
