All shared areas are 'file backed' but some of them are only backed by
shmfs.  I think we should at least dump those areas since they can't be
retrieved later.  I agree it'd be reasonable to not dump areas backed by
real files, but it'd require a simple way to distinguish them from
shmfs-backed areas.
