Hi all,
  new versions of Qt4 based qgit-2.1 and stable Qt3 based qgit-1.5.8
have been released.
Download tarballs from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=139897
Or directly from git repositories
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/qgit/qgit.git   (qgit-1.5.8)
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/qgit/qgit4.git  (qgit-2.1)
Stable qgit-1.5.8 has only maintenance fixes, not a lot indeed, it
happens to be already very stable.
New stuff is in qgit-2.1, you can find a detailed changelog at
http://git.kernel.org/?p=qgit/qgit.git;a=shortlog
After popular request, this time I have packaged qgit-2.1 in a nice
Windows installer (Inno Setup based) downloadable from the above
sourceforge link, so that our Window's friends can try qgit without
worrying about compilers, Qt libraries and other geeky things ;-)
Window installer will ask you to locate the msysgit directory. Indeed
msysgit is the only supported git distribution under Windows, because
Cygwin has some issues and is also muuuch slower.
So the only prerequisite is to have already installed msysgit

Happy new year 2008 !
