Sure, Dave Olien's patch adjusted the TPR.  However, he wrote that for the 
classic APIC; it does most of the priority adjustments in the lower nibble of 
the TPR's value.  xAPIC routing is done via HW in the PCI-to-host bridge 
chips.  There they keep a copy of each CPU's TPR value in eight XTPR 
registers for lowest priority interrupt routing -- but only the TPR's upper 
nibble.  So, Dave's patch is less useful on xAPIC systems.
I came up with something simpler.   Just 2 lines added to idle_cpu() and 
do_IRQ respectively.  It's a hack but it seemed useful.
Interesting that it would be a microsecond slower.  Maybe that's the time it 
takes to adjust the TPR.  One more reason to keep those adjustments as simple 
as possible.
