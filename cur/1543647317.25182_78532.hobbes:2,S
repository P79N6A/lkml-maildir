No. I'm not going to accept crap like that.
It's either defined or not.  None of the "only sometimes".
Make a CONFIG_xxx option that means what s390 wants it to mean, and no, 
I'm not going to accept it if you #define that by hand in some .c file. It 
needs to be in the architecture config file, like all the other config 
options.
