I have similar experience as Daniel..
It seems we need to say that because I have heard some people complain
about the lack of stable interfaces. In fact, I wrote the original patch
just after one person blamed Linux for not having stable interfaces,
and that Linux people just change those APIs to be mean for third 
parties (which is obviously false).

... And the new paragraph supports that goal by assuring others that 
we don't do unnecessary changes.
