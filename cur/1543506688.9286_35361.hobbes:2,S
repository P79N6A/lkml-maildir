There's no way why this should happen with the ISDN patches. First of all,
people who don't use ISDN are not affected. The isdn files are in
/drivers/isdn only (and some header files in include/linux). The patches
don't touch a single file in the non-ISDN code. 
Secondly, ISDN is pretty well tested. Since the ISDN code in < 2.2.11 did
work for only few people and few cards, everbody used the CVS development
code any way, so there's actually hundreds of people using it in
everyday's life.
I've been following ISDN4Linux development for more than a year now, and
there's not been a single report of isdn crashing the kernel (apart from a
bug in some BIOSes which initialised some cards to a wrong PCI location).

The best address is probably i4ldeveloper@listserv.isdn4linux.de, it's a
mailing list. Actually, I'm not sure if it's open to post for
non-subscribers, so if not send it to me, I'll forward it.
Do you use VJ-Header Compression? There was a bug fixed recently, I don't
know if the patch already made its way to the kernel source.
