1 process.  1 cpu machine.  1 gige card.  As much ram as you want.  No 
syscalls.  Must exhibit a load curve similar to:
	y
	|  ...............
	| .
	|.
	+----------------x
Where x == requests per second sent to the machine and y is the number 
of resposes per second sent out of the machine.  Hint: read the phttpd 
and /dev/poll papers for an idea of the breakdown that happens for larger 
values of x (make the cpu slower to cause the interesting points to move 
lower).  For a third dimension to the graph, make the number of total 
connections the z axis.
