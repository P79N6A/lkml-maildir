Compile your own kernel with drivers only for hardware you
actually have and use during boot.  Omit all other drivers.  That gets
rid
of a lot of probing, and the time from "kernel loaded" to "starting
init"
gets quite short.  Also, some drivers lets you specify irq's etc.
on the kernel command line - that may avoid further probing.
Drivers for things not needed in the kernel boot process (cdrom, floppy, 
ethernet, etc.) can be made modular.  That avoids time-consuming cd
spinup
and probing of non-boot devices.
The kernel boot is only a few seconds on my office machine.  The bios
boot is one long delay, the initscripts another.
