glib has AFAIK next to nothing to do with a libc AFAICT (i.e. it is
using standard libc functions but that's all).

Here you have your backwards compatibility.

As other told there never was a stable kernel module interface. Of
course there is probably enough willing manpower out there who will work
on that once you pay them. Or you can provide such support on your own.
Or do you (or anybody else) has drivers which should be maintained for
vanilla-kernel and/or vendor kernels and/or other kernels (to fix the
breakage in a cosntructive way), we can provide you with an offer to do
that.
