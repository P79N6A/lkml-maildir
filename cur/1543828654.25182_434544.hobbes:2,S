Thanks Joachim.  I've applied all four patches.  I had to add wrappers
around the twofish assembly routines because asmlinkage may differ from
the normal C calling convention.  It should get optimised away to just
a jump if the conventions are identical.
BTW Andi, I think it might be better to have the x86-64 patch sit in the
cryptodev tree rather than x86-64 because it won't even compile without
the previous patches.  If you really want to, I can leave out the x86-64
one in particular for you to merge after the others go upstream.
Cheers,
