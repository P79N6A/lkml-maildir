I hadn't thought at first because there's no artefact at all (not even
a small one) on my Celeron, but you're right.  They don't appear on
any Intels(*), but they do on all AMDs that I have results for.
(*) With the possible exception of one P4 that reports varying results.

I'm speculating that L1 is physically tagged, and when there's a
virtual alias the CPU moves data from one L1 line to another.  L2 only
comes into it because the line transfer is slow enough that a
MESI-style transfer through L2 (as if another CPU or device requested
the line) would account for the slowness.
