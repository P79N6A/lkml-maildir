Hmm. Somebody else reported a problem with keyboards and USB enabled. I
know you had USB on earlier, can you check that?
In fact, I have a few reports from you that seem to imply that the same
kernel sources have worked for you or not, depending on exact
configuration options. One of the differences I see in your previous
working/nonworking setup (using 2.3.38) is that a previous try with USB
enabled caused problems, while USB off worked.
Worth at least verifying,
