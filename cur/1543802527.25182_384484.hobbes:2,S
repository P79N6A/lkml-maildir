You could just remove this driver completely as well. Because  
practically since
it's inclusion in to the main stream kernel it has been outdated and  
nonfunctioning.
1. Formerly the actually usable driver has actually maintained under  
the URL data you remove.
2. Nobody ever cared to synchronize the maintained driver and the in  
kernel one.
3. The physical recording format in the driver provided with the  
kernel is broken.
4. Right now the corresponding user space tools can't be found on the  
web any longer.
5. I'm not talking about years. Its more then 5 years in this case.
