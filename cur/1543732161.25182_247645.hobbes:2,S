Hello, Jim,
You would use rcu_read_lock() instead of rcu_read_lock_bh() in cases
where you did not want the read-side code to disable bottom halves.
This is very similar to choosing between read_lock() and read_lock_bh()
-- if you unnecessarily use read_lock_bh() or rcu_read_lock_bh(), you
will be unnecessarily delaying drivers' bottom-half execution.

The RCU "_bh()" interfaces correspond to a different set of quiescent
states than do the standard interfaces.  You could indeed use
rcu_read_lock() with interrupts disabled, but I don't know of any
such use.
						Thanx, Paul
