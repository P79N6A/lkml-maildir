My pragmatic side agrees with you. My sense of beauty does not. I think
you make 2 small hacks here:
1) Adding a limit like above smells wrong.
2) Making PI only apply to RT tasks isn't beautifull either.
On the other hand the plists are "beautifull". It would sadden me if they
are thrown away.
As I said in an earlier mail, I think you should agree on an interface
between the rt_mutex code and list structure. Then Daniel can implement
and test his plist in user space, somebody else can implement and test
the sorted list in userspace and the transition can happen with a switch
of a macro and a recompilation.
I hope I will get some time to help out from next weekend. I am taking
exams right now.
