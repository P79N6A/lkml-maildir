Sorry I didn't provide this.  My recent effort started to clean up some
ugliness in some current patches that worked around this actually
happening a few months ago.  The original example didn't survive :)

I don't disagree.  But, I do think that getting the core
(include/linux/*) files to stop depending on architecture-specific ones
is a step.  Most other cleanups aren't as obviously correct, or have
such obviously limited impact.  So, I'm starting by patches that have
the least impact rather than actual bottom or top of the problem.

Especially with the vm headers, I have also seen quite a few
dependencies on simple macro variables.  I'd also like to see some
constant macro only files.

I'll eagerly await your post :)

The nice part about detecting and fixing these kinds of changes is that
they're not very subtle.  I'd much rather fix an include problem than an
SMP race any day :)
I certainly agree that their correct place for anything pervasive is in
the beginning of a development series.
