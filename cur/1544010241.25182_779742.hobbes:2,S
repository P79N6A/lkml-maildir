I've send a few iterations of my SuperH CMT timer patches to the
linux-sh list, but I'd be happy to post next version to lkml instead
if you prefer that!
The CMT driver also needs the following patches:
[PATCH] clocksource: pass clocksource to read() callback
[PATCH][RFC] early platform driver support
Any comments on the early platform driver code?
Thanks,
