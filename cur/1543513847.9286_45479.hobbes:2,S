Hello Ted,
Given the fact that _IF_ the status of ioctl( fd, TIOCSERGETLSR, &result)
after the write call is correct, my halfduplex software (Hart) works fine 
_AND_
the ( info->xmit_buf might be considered as a SOFTWARE FIFO in
addition to the internal (fifo) registers
I have the following suggestion:
Make the result of ioctl( fd, TIOCGETSLR, &value) reflect the status
of the *hardware* bits as well the value of ( info->xmit_cnt > 0)
in get_lsr_info.
In this case even if the data has not reached the chip, the transmitter
is not flagged empty, which to my view is correct.
Regards
Kees
