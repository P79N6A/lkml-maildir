None of these.  All "execve" really does is to discard the current VM
setup, tell the VM system to attach this process to the new
executable image, and then transfer control to the starting
instruction of the program.  Since nothing is really in memory, aside
from maybe some caching/readahead, page faults do all the work of
loading application code, page by page, on demand.
