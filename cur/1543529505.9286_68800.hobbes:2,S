Subject: 2.3.51 build fails: unresolved symbol 'parport_pc_init_pci'
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Okay, I've been gone for a while, but I'm back with two bug reports, of
which this is the first.  This looks really obvious, so my apologies if
you're intentionally leaving this broken for some reason... I couldn't
find anything about in on the lkml archives when I looked, but I'm out of 
the loop on the kernel for now.
[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
build fails with unresolved symbol 'parport_pc_init_pci'
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
When building 2.3.51 and including support for pc-style parallel ports, I
get an undefined symbol parport_pc_init_pci.  I can get around the problem
by disabling parallel port support, but this has obvious disadvantages for
my printer. :)
A simple grep indicates to me that this function is declared for several
platforms in asm/parport.h, but is never actually defined.
My config file is included below.  I'm including the rest of this just for
the hell of it... it's probably not useful.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
lp, parallel port
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.3.51 (root@walker1-83) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000220
(Debian GNU/Linux)) #2 Sun Mar 12 08:12:08 CST 2000
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)

     problem (if possible)
#!/bin/sh
make bzImage # :)
