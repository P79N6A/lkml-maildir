Pretty much.  In adding the patch, you've added six more bytes
to each BUG() call site and numerous filenames.  For me, the
kernel came out a little smaller, but for you, it grew a bit.  I
wonder why.  From a quick test it seems that gcc-3.0.3 and
recent binutils do fold common strings between compilation
units.  But I need to double-check that.  Maybe it's due to
that somehow.
Of course, for the extra 300 bytes of kernel you've gained
file-and-line info in all the BUG calls.
