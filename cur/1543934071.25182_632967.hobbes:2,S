The more I've looked at the code this afternoon, I'm certain this is the case.  
I've also been running a patched kernel (using option #2 from below) and all 
of the skbs coming up the stack have valid ->iif values.  Granted, I haven't 
examined the code from the avahi daemon or the tcl test cases and traced the 
entire code path through the kernel but I _am_ certain that at some point in 
that code path the packet is cloned and due to a problem in skb_clone() 
the ->iif field is not copied correctly causing the problems we have all 
seen.
How much smoke needs to be coming from the gun? :)

That was my gut feeling.  I was also a little unsure where exactly the correct 
placement should be for the memset() call.

Okay, I'll stick with this approach.  I'll post a patch backed against 
net-2.6.25 tomorrow as an RFC to see if anyone on netdev has any strong 
feelings.  If no one complains, I'll add it to the lblnet git tree.
