No. The point is that this is _very_ system-specific. Some systems resume
always at full speed, some always at low speed; for S4 the behaviour may be
completely unpredictable. And in fact I wouldn't want my desktop P4 drop th
12.5 % frequency if I ask it to suspend to disk, too. "Ignoring" the warning
seems to be the best thing to me. The good thing is, after all, that cpufreq
detected this situation and tries to correct for it.
