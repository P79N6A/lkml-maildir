I've started going through this one to clean it up to the point where it
can go forward.  It's been sitting at the top of the unstable portion of
the patch queue for long enough, I think :)
I've converted the msecs to jiffies until the user boundary, changed the
union #defines as suggested by Andrew, and various other little issues etc.
Remaining to do is a generic time-difference calculator (instead of
jbd2_time_diff), and looking into whether it should be made a config
option; I tend to think it should, but it's fairly well sprinkled
through the code, so I'll see how well that works.
Also did we ever decided if this should go to debugfs?
Thanks,
-Eric
