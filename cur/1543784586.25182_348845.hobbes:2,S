The reason I really dislike patches like these is that it causes people to 
do questionable things.
For example, there may be perfectly valid reasons why somebody doesn't
care about the result. I don't see much point in forcing people to check
the return value of "pci_enable_wake()" for example. There's really no
real reason to ever care, as far as I can tell - if it fails, there's 
nothing you can really do about it anyway.
Also, in general, the fact is that things like "pci_set_power_state()" 
might fail in _theory_, but we just don't care. A driver that doesn't 
check the return value is in practice as good a driver as one that does, 
and forcing people to add code that is totally useless in reality - or 
look at a warning that is irritating - is just not very productive.
There are functions where it is really _important_ to check the error 
return, because they return errors often enough - and the error case is 
something you have to do something about - that it's good to force people 
to be aware.
But "pci_set_power_state()"?
I don't think so.
