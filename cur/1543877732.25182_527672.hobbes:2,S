Hmm, may be we are getting confused with the word 'reentrant' here.
The idea behind this API was to freeze the system for one event
only at any given time.
However, we can have nested freeze_processes() call for different events.
Something like 
freeze_processes(FE_SUSPEND);
/* Do something */
	freeze_processes(FE_HOTPLUG_CPU);
	/* hotplug cpus */
	thaw_processes(FE_HOTPLUG_CPU);
/* Do something more */
thaw_processes(FE_SUSPEND);
So ideally no one is supposed to make a call like
freeze_processes(FE_SUSPEND | FE_HOTPLUG_CPU);
OR
freeze_processes(FE_ALL);
I guess I should also put a check for a valid freeze event.
