Does anyone remember what the last kernel was that the c-qcam v4l driver
worked.
The cqcam package works with the camera but the c-qcam kernel modules
doesn't work.
the camera is a Color QuickCam 2.0, the kernel is 2.2.12, here's what I
get:
This is before the parport, parport_pc, parport_probe, videodev and
c-qcam modules are loaded.
[root@little-geek /root]# modprobe c-qcam
/lib/modules/2.2.12/misc/c-qcam.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
parport: Device or resource busy
[root@little-geek /root]# cat /proc/parport/0/autoprobe 
CLASS:MEDIA;
MODEL:Color QuickCam 2.0;
MANUFACTURER:Connectix;
[root@little-geek /root]# cat /proc/parport/0/hardware  
base:   0x378
irq:    7
dma:    none
modes:  SPP,PS2
here are the kernel messages:
Linux video capture interface: v1.00
Connectix Colour Quickcam driver v0.02
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [SPP,PS2]
parport0: Multimedia device, Connectix Color QuickCam 2.0
