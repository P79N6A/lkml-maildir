Back around March there was a discussion of sharing interactivity bonus with 
the server an interactive process was waiting for.  It was mostly about 
XFree86 not getting batch scheduled and making mouse movement unusable so 
easily, but this sounds eerily similar...
In this case, it seems like the wine client either isn't accumulating an 
interactivity bonus (busy-waiting?), or else it's not transmitting it to the 
wine server (going through the network stack)?
I've been a bit out of touch since then (old ISP blew up, then i got busy).  
Just resurfacing now.  Maybe it's old news, but assuming the patch I'm 
thinking of wasn't backed out while I was away, it may be relevant.  The 
thread about it started here:

Unlikely.  Interrupts don't depend on the scheduler.  (Neither did bottom 
halves or tasklets.  I don't think work queues do either, but I'm a bit 
behind...)
