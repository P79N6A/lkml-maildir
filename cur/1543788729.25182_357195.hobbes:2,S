 Hi,
 Recently I've noticed, that running any OpenGL application in X11
(screensaver, glxgears, Quake 3 Arena) locks display. System is working,
but display remains locked even if I ssh and kill X.
 Kernel 2.6.13 works OK. Kernel 2.6.14-rc1 and later locks up. I
couldn't find any git snapshots between 2.6.13 and .14-rc1.
 System is Slackware, x11-6.8.2, Matrox G550 with mga driver.
