A big, big thankyou to Colin.
This patch indeed makes difference. I stressed -pre9 as much as I could
(simultaneous reading from raid devices - ext3/reiserfs/ext2, NFS traffic,
sendmail+apache fork storms... you name it, I ran it, all at the same time)
and the kernel lives. Processes still get killed by VM much earlier than
they should (100+ MB RAM free), but that's not critical.
A nice conclusion to this thread, isn't it? :)
