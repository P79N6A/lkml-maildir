I was not speaking of its disk performance, but rather of low-latency
CPU performance.  In 2.4 with the low-latency patches, reiserfs did
that fairly well.
I know its design is not focused on streaming large blocks of data to
disk.  But, when you're recording clicks every 20 seconds, disk
throughput is definitely a secondary consideration.
Looks like we need to do another study to determine which filesystem
works best for multi-track audio recording and playback.  XFS looks
promising, but only if they get the latency right.  Any experience
with that?
