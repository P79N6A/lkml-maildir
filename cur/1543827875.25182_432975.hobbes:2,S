Here's a simple solution that solves the problem:  
For any given cm_id, there are a finite (and small) number of
outstanding CM events that can be posted.  So we just pre-allocate them
when the cm_id is created and keep them on a free list hanging off of
the cm_id struct.  Then the event handler function will pull from this
free list.  
The only case where there is any non-finite issue is on the passive
listening cm_id.  Each incoming connection request will consume a work
struct.  So based on client connects, we could run out of work structs.
However, the CMA has the concept of a backlog, which is defined as the
max number of pending unaccepted connection requests.  So we allocate
these work structs based on that number (or a computation based on that
number), and if we run out, we simply drop the incoming connection
request due to backlog overflow (I suggest we log the drop event too).
When a MPA connection request is dropped, the (IETF conforming) MPA
client will eventually time out the connection and the consumer can
retry.
