Please append a correct "root=" boot option
kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:03
--------
The system has three partitions.
1. /dev/sda1  /boot   125 MB  ext3
2. /dev/sda2  /      30.5 GB  ext3
3. /dev/sda3  swap    3.5 GB  swap
And the RAM is 2048MB.
Boot options used : root=/dev/sda2 mem=2048M.
Any clues?
Thanks,
