It happens to me madly on one of my machines.  The machine is just some
three-year-old PS/2 setup.  It's due to mouse activity.
To reproduce:
1: press and hold a key
2: start moving the mouse in large, rapid circles
3: release the key.
The keystrokes continue to be inserted for an arbitrarily long period: it's
easy to generate thousands of them.  The mouse has to be moved in circles:
moving it from side-to-side causes small stops which allow things to
correct themselves.
It's quite irritating in practice.
