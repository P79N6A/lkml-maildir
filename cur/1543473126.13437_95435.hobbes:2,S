If Richard Stallman gets mad at the linux community for not using the term
gnu/linux and decides to release a new version of the GPL that undoes its
current meaning (and e.g. allows proprietary forking etc), thus affecting
all programs currently licenced under the GPL, what could anyone do about
that? And please don't say, "oh, he would *never* do something like that."
