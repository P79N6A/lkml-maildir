hi,
I am compiling kernel 2.6.9 on a sparc32 architecture (SUN4C) with
GCC3.3.4, and found that drivers/video/bw2.c has a compilation problem
on line 389.
There is a call that passes &options as 2nd argument, but the "options"
variable isn't defined anywhere.
In drivers/video/cg6.c there is the same kind of call, but it passes
NULL instead of &options, so I altered bw2.c to replace &options with
NULL, so the compilation can go on (it's a part of the make image part).
I am not a specialist of video drivers on sparc32 (I have a CG6,
anyway), but I'm reporting this compilation problem so a true specialist
of this part of the code can raise an eyebrow on it.
thank you for your attention,
regards,
Regis
