Count my HO too.
Kernel isn't school desk at first place. It's already bloated as with
various 2+y obsolete changelogs (that have content, that even older),
with unsorted documentation (hypertext and http are better on this).
Up to date test cases and example code must be on developer's site,
not as burden in the sources. Yea, linux tar ball is a popular one.
But sorry, it already has too much unneeded stuff for most of the
freelance users and testers. This tarball must have good end result
with propper changelogs and pointers to *fresh* information.
