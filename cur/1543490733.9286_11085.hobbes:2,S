Cheaper would be 
        && !(flags & (RTCF_MASQ|RTCF_NAT))
otherwise your fix looks right. But on the other hand - if you have
routing tables that suggest that a ICMP redirect should be send from
the masquerading host, then your routing tables are broken.
It would be better to fix the routing tables.
