This is what I get with the latest git:
dmesg | grep uvc
[   11.797824] uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device Built-in iSight (05ac:8501)
[   11.810472] uvcvideo: UVC non compliance - GET_DEF(PROBE) not 
supported. Enabling workaround.
[   11.821440] usbcore: registered new interface driver uvcvideo
I don't have a problem with it enabling a workaround,
it's just the whinnying noise I get with my box.
(sounds like morse code);
As soon as the isight.fw is loaded(with past kernels) the morse code sound
from the machine disappears.
