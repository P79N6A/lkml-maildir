We do.  In principle, the current buffer cache supports any power-of-two
multiple of 512 bytes up to the hardware page size.

We do normalise the IO in places, yes.  The IO request structures always
pass IOs around in multiples of 512 bytes, but that still works just
fine if the actual hardware sector size is larger.
