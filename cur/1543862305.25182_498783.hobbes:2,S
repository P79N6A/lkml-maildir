You need to stop using the devices before unplugging.  If you have no
pending IO to the device, there won't be 'rejects IO to dead device'
messages.  You can ignore the SCSI cache sync failure if the device is
properly closed before being unplugged.

So, no, you don't really have to care.  Just make sure the device is
unmounted prior to unplugging.
