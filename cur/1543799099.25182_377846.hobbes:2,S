Can you tell why it also does that START_STOP/1 thing? That looks a bit 
strange. 
Also, can somebody go through the READ/WRITE difference for me for a 
zero-length command? If the _only_ difference is a protection one (WRITE 
commands need write permissions), then I'm ok with this (I think it's 
very reasonable that somebody who can read a cd-rom can also eject it), 
but if there's some SCSI layer logic that says "writes cannot have length 
0", then I think that's a bug.
