Hmm... I'm using XFree86 4.3.0, which probably makes a big difference.
Also, try tweaking the values of NvAGP in the XF86Config-4 file
(I'm using NvAGP=3, your mileage may vary, depending on whether the 
NVidia AGP support or the agpgart version plays nicer with your box).
Here's the relevant .config I'm using (oh, and I use 'vga=794' at
boot, which gives me a 64x160 char display..

Works for me, hopefully something here will click and we'll figure out
why it isn't working for you...
