Well, when I tried using it in a program with some sleeps to test.. I 
noticed that the intermediate process that daemon creates is not cleaned 
up with a wait() call (so I see a defunct process in the ps listing).
If I manually do the double fork() then I can call waitpid() myself for 
the pid that I know it spawned.   But if I just call wait() after 
calling daemon, then I don't know if I just cleaned up the pid it 
spawned (do I?), or some other previously spawned one (for perhaps 
totally different reasons)..
For my specifics it may not be a problem, but I guess I'm just whining 
about the fact that daemon() doesn't clean it up itself (or can it?)
Thanks much,
    Davy
