Well `ps` does the wrong thing so users need to do the wrong thing
to be compatible.
`ps` reads the command-line from the proc file-system.  Obviously
the command-line can't be changed after a program starts executing
because it's something that was passed to the program before execution.
That's like making somebody un-pregnant.
So, hacks from hackers `setproctitle` comes to mind, replace some of
the command-line, usually overwriting the environment strings, with
some alien text.
With the current API, (Unix) the "'correct'" way to set a process
title is for everybody to agree upon an environment string like "TITLE=".
Then, if you want to change the process title, you change that string.
`ps` would then look for the "TITLE=" token and use the string after that.
However, it's unlikely that anybody will ever do that because of:
(1) Inertia.
(2) NIH.
PS it's trivial to modify `ps` to search for "TITLE=" and display
that, as well as the command-line strings IFF "TITLE=" is not found.
A new `ps` would make new/old compatibility work, but again, it's
unlikely that this 20 year-old problem will ever be fixed.
