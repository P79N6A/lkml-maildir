Could you post the test case for this behavior: I assume your test app 
is buggy: a select call that is executed after close returned must 
return EBADF, everything else would be a bug.
Regarding your main point: The return result from select/poll is 
undefined in Linux if you close a descriptor while another thread polls 
or selects it.
This is consistent with the behavior of other Unices - for example HP UX 
kills the process if you replace a descriptor that is being polled with 
dup2.
