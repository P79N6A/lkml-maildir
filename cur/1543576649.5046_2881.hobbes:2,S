No.
This all only matters to things that do shared writable mmap's.
Almost nothing does that. innd is (sadly) the only regular thing that uses
this, which is why it's always innd that breaks, even if everything else
works.
And even innd is often compiled to use "write()" instead of shared
mappings (it's a config option), so not even all innd's will break.
