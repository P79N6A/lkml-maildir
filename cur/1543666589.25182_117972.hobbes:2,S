I resent this. It was explained 1000 times before
that /usr/include/{asm,linux} belong to glibc, not kernel.
Replacing these links with pointers to an updated kernel
will produce applications which mismatch the installed glibc,
and then mysteriously fail to work. Heinz-Ulrich can call names
all he wants, but the truth does not change.
