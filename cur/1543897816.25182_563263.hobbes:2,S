This would seem to be a (fairly, it's no doubt just outputting mono) skype 
specific problem and given that skype is a proprietary closed source 
application, you now get to go suck on a Skype support engineer! Hurrah!

No, no idea why skype would require you to do this yourself. Maybe you 
should ask them. This is now _really_ no longer a kernel issue though.
