Hi,
If I understood you correct earlier, the only policy you needed to
enforce was to prevent double-chrooting.  If that is the case, why is it
not sufficient to keep a "process-has-used-chroot" flag in
current->security which is set on the first call to
capable(CAP_SYS_CHROOT) and inherited by forked children, after which
calls to capable(CAP_SYS_CHROOT) are refused?
Of course if you need to do more, then a hook might be necessary.
