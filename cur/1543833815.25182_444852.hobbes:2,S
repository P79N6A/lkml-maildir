Here is the output of mcelog:
root@srv1:~# less /var/log/mcelog
MCE 0
CPU 0 0 data cache TSC 6988ae18046
ADDR f87f5ec0
  Data cache ECC error (syndrome ce)
       bit46 = corrected ecc error
  bus error 'local node origin, request didn't time out
      data read mem transaction
      memory access, level generic'
STATUS 9467400000000833 MCGSTATUS 0
MCE 0
CPU 0 0 data cache TSC 723b38a3633
ADDR 3d9fc0
  Data cache ECC error (syndrome ce)
       bit46 = corrected ecc error
       bit62 = error overflow (multiple errors)
  bus error 'local node origin, request didn't time out
      data read mem transaction
      memory access, level generic'
STATUS d467400000000833 MCGSTATUS 0
Since it shows ECC error is the hypothesis correct that its the RAM
problem and replacing it should solve the problem.
