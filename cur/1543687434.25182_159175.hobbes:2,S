Fair enough. I don't have such an explicit test at the moment, but I 
will talk to the gnome guys and see if I can come up with one. I was 
reporting what the gnome2 session-manager complains about, but 
comparable errors come from something as simple as gnome-terminal 
(simplest program I've seen that has the problem). FWIW, this is gnome 
2.2.2. I'll get back to you when I know more.
