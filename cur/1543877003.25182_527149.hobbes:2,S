Please dont call a function to do one increment !
You are touching one of the most critical part of the kernel...
Also, dont do this while interrupts are masked, this is not necessary.
Maybe better to place sysc_cnt in 'struct thread_info' because %ebp point to it.
Also you missed the fact that syscalls on i386 can use sysenter (around line 343)
