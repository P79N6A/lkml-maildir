It appears that a directory tree can only be exported once.  Is this
intentional?  If yes, the following patch should be applied (to
linux/fs/nfsd/export.c), so that the return value is more meaningful:
--- export.c	2002/08/07 09:22:11	1.1
+++ export.c	2002/08/07 09:22:28

+	err = -EBUSY;
 	if ((parent = exp_child(clp, dev, nd.dentry)) != NULL) {
 		dprintk("exp_export: export not valid (Rule 3).\n");
 		goto finish;
After this change, the userspace tools can issue are more meaningful
error message for this case.
