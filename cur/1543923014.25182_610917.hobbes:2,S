Yeah, it's a pretty serious bug if the DMA engine flags an error. But
wouldn't it be better to BUG() in the context of the caller? That way,
you won't necessarily bring down the whole system.

It's probably a good idea to dump the descriptors at some point. I
don't think the client has many options to deal with such failures
other than reset something or kill something, but if the client gets
notified, it at least has some chance of recovering.
