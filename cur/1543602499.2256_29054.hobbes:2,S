Of course that's a possibility but then we'd have to duplicate it in all
other get_swap_page callers, see?
And I think it much better fits hided in get_swap_page: the semantics of
get_swap_page() are "give to the caller a newly allocated swap entry".
So IMHO it is its own business to discard our "optimizations" to
generate a free swap entry in case all swap was just allocated.
