Which is the aim of the Zaurus kernel although it doesn't help when

OpenZaurus/OE did have code to try and do this built into its images.
I'm not sure what its status is at the moment.

Based on past performance, the bootloader (in ROM) will probably
corrupt/reset the RTC but I'd like to be proved wrong.
Russell posted some rough code to linux-arm-kernel recently that allowed
you load a new kernel in a kexec sort of manner and that is probably the
best bet to preserve the RTC. This functionality would be useful on the
Zaurus in general.
