Sigh...  OK, let me try to put it in a different way.
I don't want A (or entire old path) to disappear.  What I want is ability
to have two paths leading to the same point + ability to mark one of
them as "more interesting".
I.e. the result I want is _two_ sets of changesets with the same compositions.
And _that_ is compatible with replication - I simply want the new path in
revision graph to be propagated.  Along with the "this path is more
interesting" being written on the new one.
Can that be done?  I want a way to re-split the set of deltas.  I'm perfectly
happy with old one staying around, as long as we remember that results of
old and new are the same object and that new is a prefered way to look at
the damn thing.
I suspect that it could be doable with with something as simple as "if you
ask to merge two identical nodes, I'll just mark them as such and ask which
is more interesting".  IIRC, BK doesn't require tree topology on the graph -
it can have converging branches.
_If_ that is feasible - the rest can be scripted around it.
