   Its actually basically impossible to do back compat macros
   with this mess. Your original smin() umin() proposal was _much_ saner.
I don't see how you can logically say this.
My sint_min() etc. version broke things just
as equally because it had:
#define min __compile_error_do_not_use_min
#define max __compile_error_do_not_use_max
in it.  Do you think Linus or myself, by doing
this, intended to let anyone undef the damn things
to get around this?
The whole point of the changes was "min and max are
dumb, nobody may use them in their traditional form".
I was pretty sure, you understood this.
