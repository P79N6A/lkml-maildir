Thanks to you all for your suggestions!
Unfortunately, none of the them seem to have worked: the clock still 
stops after a period of time (usually under some cpu stress). I searched 
the FreeBSD mailing lists for a similar problem (althugh I never had the 
clock-stopping problem under FreeBSD) and found the following:

My CPU is a 2.8 Gig Prescott, but the computer (an IBM Thinkstation) is 
VERY quiet (as though no fans are running).
Is it possible something like this is trashing the Linux clock 
completely (rather than just slowing it down)? Maybe it goes out of sync 
in some sense?
I will try rebuilding the kernel with cpufreq enabled.
