Some of you will recall the woefull tale of the IBM T40 with 2GB RAM, and a 
not happy pcmcia_cs.  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/14/89
This was resolved with a new BIOS from IBM.
However, along the way Linus replied with:

and then David Hinds said this:

So, now we have a new Sony S170 (spiffy ultra-portable laptop) with a 
failure to recognize cards when it has 1GB ram installed.  And I'm 
wondering if anyone wants to tackle having the kernel PCI system remap this 
pcmcia socket's memory so it can see cards ?
        booting with 1GB ram:
kernel: Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
kernel:   options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0000, PCI irq9
kernel: Socket status: 00000000
        revert to 512MB or 768MB ram, and you get a happy PCMCIA slot:
kernel: Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
kernel:   options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0cf8, PCI irq9
kernel: Socket status: 30000410
The is completely independent of the kernel (2.4.24 and 2.6.8 have the same 
problem (as its really a BIOS problem I think.)  Cardbus and PCMCIA cards 
are affected equally.
lspci: Sony S170
02:04.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments: Unknown device ac8e
        Full logs are available: (dmesg, lspci -xxx, iomem, ioports)
