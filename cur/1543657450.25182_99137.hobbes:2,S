When a packet is freed, the upper layers must be notified, for example a 
user space process could be waiting for socket buffer space. This can 
happen either immediately, or in the next softirq.
dev_kfree_skb_irq() is always ok, although slower than the other 
functions. The packet is unconditionally queued and processed later.
dev_kfree_skb_any() tries to optimize it a bit: If it thinks that it's 
save to process it now, then the packet is processed immediately. The 
autodetection is usually correct, except for the special case I 
mentioned. Drivers must work around that.
dev_kfree_skb() always processes the packet immediately. Only permitted 
from bottom half context or from process context.
