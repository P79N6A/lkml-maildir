I think there is lot of simplicity and value add by charging one
container (even unfairly) for one resource completely.  This puts the
onus on system admin to set up the containers appropriately.

You would be better off having a notion of "shared" container where
these kind of resources get charged. So, if 100 processes are all
touching pages from some common file then the file could be part of
self-contained container with its own limits etc.
