That certainly works for me - informational but not irritating. I just
suspect it will scroll past without being seen that much, though.
But along with a stack_dump() or something to make it a bit more
noticeable it might actually be visible.

I dunno - I personally think more people look at the compile output than
at the dmessages when they scroll past. But maybe it's just me (I don't
use -s, but I tend to do "make -j4 bzImage > ../makes", so the _only_
thing I see are warnings and errors).
