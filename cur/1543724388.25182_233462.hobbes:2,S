Hi Alan,
I have just subscribed Linux-usb-users tonight.
I found your message

I maybe have almost the same enclosure using Genesys chip.

I tried following patch with a little change.

Before I patched the kernel, I met many errors and hangups
with big files writing into the enclosure.
After with your patch, It works fine for me.
My kernel is linux-2.4.27-rc3 with video4linux2 patch.
HDD in the enclosure is HGST Deskstar 7K250.
Just a report.
Best Regards,
Hisaaki Shibata
