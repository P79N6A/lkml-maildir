I meant that we end up with having one thread per IO - they were
preallocated, but that does not matter. And what about your idea of
switching userspace threads to cachemiss threads?
My main concern was only about the situation, when we ends up with truly
bloking context (like network), and this results in having thousands of
threads doing the work - even having most of them sleeping, there is a
problem with memory overhead and context switching, although it is usable
situation, but when all of them are ready immediately - context switching 
will kill a machine even with O(1) scheduler which made situation damn
better than before, but it is not a cure for the problem.
