Why mindless?
Coding style is also about giving the coding language logic a graphical
representation.  Following a convention that flow control keywords
such as "if", "for", or "while" are distinguished from function calls
by use of a space after the keyword really helps the code readability
regardless of how people used to code it in the past...
The for_each_* macros are clearly not function calls but rather translate
to for () flow control constructs hence they should follow the same convention.
FWIW, I think that changing the existing convention is worth it in this case.
