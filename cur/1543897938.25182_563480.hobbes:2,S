What a mess.
I guess we could add an empty readb() implementation to lib/lib.a so the
arch will pick that up if all else fails.  But it's pretty stinky.  And
it won't work either because we don't know at compile-time to declare
the prototype for that thing appropriately.
So... what's the proper fix here?  "The arch must implement readb"?  That's
bad: if the arch really cannot implement readb(), we want builds to fail
if someone tries to use it.
I think I'll go shopping instead.
