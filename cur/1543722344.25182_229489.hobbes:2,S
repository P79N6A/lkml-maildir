Well, no idea. The keyword here is "sometimes"...
I'll try to find a better way to reproduce this and report again with/without preempt.
AFAIR, last time I got this when I "abruptly" stopped the BT stack on my phone, while using rfcomm for ppp.
Just in case, I updated to bluez-{libs,utils}-2.7, but still got one Oops (essentially the same).
These days I'll have to use the phone and a laptop, but will be away. If I found out something more will post it.
Kalin.
