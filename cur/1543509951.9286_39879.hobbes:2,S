It is easier to just ensure the stack is sanely aligned all the time. This
means at most 14 bytes/call for a noticeable performance increment
(floating point mostly, IIRC).  In the kernel, with its minuscule stacks,
the wasted memory sure hurts, elsewhere it doesn't matter at all.

You may write that, others don't want to go over legacy code and add this
kind of black magic all over the place, just for the case they might
compile with gcc on ia32.

It is better for everybody involved if you _don't_ have to RTFM looking for
obscure flags that are essential for decent performance.
If you really see a decrease in performance in real-world code, contact the
egcs folks and discuss it with them.
