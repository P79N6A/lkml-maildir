Note that doing so is perfectly fine.
But only for local variables that haven't had their addresses taken.
The fact is, those kinds of variables really *are* special. They are 
provably not accessible from any other context, and re-ordering them (or 
doing anything AT ALL to them - the most basic and very important 
optimization is caching them in registers, of course) is always purely an 
internal compiler issue.
But if gcc re-orders functions calls with *other* memory accesses, gcc is 
totally broken. I doubt it does that. It would break on all but the most 
trivial programs, and it would be a clear violation of even standard C.
HOWEVER: the bug that started this thread isn't even "reordering 
accesses", it's *adding* accesses that weren't there (and please don't mix 
this up with "volatile", since volatile is a totally unrelated issue and 
has nothing what-so-ever to do with anything).
