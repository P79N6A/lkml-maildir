Well... Yes, but don't forget that it's not just a client issue but a
server issue too.
The NFSv2 'rdev' field is an unspecified 32-bit integer
format.
For NFSv3, you have a 32-bit major and a 32-bit minor number. Again
the mapping is unspecified by the protocol.
It all works by assuming that the client and server have agreed to use
the same format/conventions.
So if we want to retain backward compatibility with existing 2.4.x NFS
(and particularly NFSroot) clients/servers, then we want to ensure
that all numbers that are sent over the wire stay the same.
Cheers,
