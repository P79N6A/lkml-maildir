Sounds interesting, although I do not think that freeing resources should be
done at stop time, it is task for remove() IMHO. Do you have an idea how
setting up process (between probe and start) will work? Will start called
automatically or by request from userspace?

Well, it sure needs to be available on per-device/per-driver basis as while
I am generally enjoying automatic binding without userspace involvement.
For example I sometimes want to be able to disable my touchpad and not
let it spring back to life (normally serio core will try to find
proper driver for
an unbound port whenever there is a data coming from it).
Whether it should also be controlled on per bus/per system basis is
another question. I am not quite ready to drop all device tables and rely
solely on userspace handling, altthough if all tables are marked as __init
and and the end of the boot process we walk all buses and set their
->match() methods to NULL we effectively switch to manual binding
mode and can discard ID tables.
