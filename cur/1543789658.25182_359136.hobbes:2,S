Subject: Is ext3 flush data to disk when files are closed?

As far as I know, if an application modifies a file on an ext3 file
ssytem, it actually change the page cache, and the dirty pages will be
flushed to disk by kupdate periodically.
My question is: if a file is to be closed, but some of its data pages
are marked as dirty, will system block on close() and wait for dirty
pages being flushed to disk? If so, it seems to decrease performance
significantly if a lot of updates on many small files are involved.
Can someone point me to the right place to check how it works? Thanks!
Xin
