Both or these aren't really practical once you think it through. Don't 
forget that each binary module can be wrapped by an GPL-module which the 
kernel cannot do anything at all about and the kernel would never even know 
a binary only module was loaded because the GPL module does it. There is no 
such thing as security... This kind of thing is already in use by at least 
two companies I know of (i.e. using open sourced glue modules to binary 
only code) so it is not just a theory I am making up...
Just my 2p.
