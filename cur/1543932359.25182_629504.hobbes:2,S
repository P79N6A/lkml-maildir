could you resend your kprobes cleanups against current x86.git? They
have been conceptually acked by Masami. This cuts out the unification
part of your queue which is bad luck but the effort has been duplicated
already so there's not much we can do about it i guess.
Your other 17 cleanup and unification patches are still queued up in
x86.git and passed a lot of testing, so they will likely go into
v2.6.25. Nice work!
