Of course I admit it, that is a copy of the definition of list_for_each_safe()
(with just the '/'s removed).  But the point is, if you are writing
something that iterates through a list and deletes entries, you
basically have to write equivalent code.
Just think about how many silly bugs you've written in your life when
(re)implementing linked lists.  By using <linux/list.h>, you avoid all
that, and as a code reviewer that makes my life easier.  It's the same
theory as <linux/kref.h> -- the code is rather trivial (although as
"git log lib/kref.c" shows, not entirely trivial).  But if I see
someone using struct kref, all I have to check is whether she used it
correctly.  I don't have to worry about whether she screwed up the
implementation.
