I agree - this is under proc because this is an acpi driver, and the acpi
subsystem is still using the /proc fs for driver/user space interface. I
thought I would just conform to their standard.

I tested the Dell M65 with this patch, and you are right - it does not
send an event when you press the eject button, but rather when you do the
actual remove.  I sent a mail to their BIOS people informing them that we
would find it helpful to have the eject request as well as the removal event,
but, I am not holding my breath.  The remove event seems to be "good enough",
although I can definitely forsee issues.

This is the way I was planning on doing it too - and I'd like to do that
for SATA - unfortunately, a lot of the removable drives are actually 
PATA, and until hotplug support for this gets integrated into libata,
as a workaround we have to tell userspace to try to unmount the filesystem
first, otherwise the whole system locks up.  Even new laptops such as the
Lenovo X60 have IDE bays on them.
I think that it would be appropriate and possible to determine if we
were a SATA removable drive from the bay driver, and then if so - 
call into the scsi layer (or vice versa) to do the remove completely
in kernel - this is the best way in my opinion anyway since ATM the
eject event is triggered when the user removes the drive, which means
that if it takes a lot of time to trigger the userspace scripts, you
can wind up with problems.

So what are the firmware hooks that you speak of?  I would love to have
this represented under the appropriate scsi layer (assuming SATA) if 
possible - it seems more natural to me also.
