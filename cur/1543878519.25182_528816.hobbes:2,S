Well that depends on which end-user.  Those wanting to create a vserver
or checkpoint-restart job will want this, but clearly we have a long way
to go for that upstream anyway.

The check is still there - see kernel/nsproxy.c:unshare_nsproxy_namespaces().

I don't know how far removed that is from the one being used by redhat,
but assuming it's the same, then redhat-lspp@redhat.com will be
very interested.

Agreed those need fixing.

Hmm, I guess I get lost using my own little systems, and just assumed
that shared subtree functionality was making its way up into mount(8).
Ram, have you been working on that?

See toward the end of the 'shared subtrees' OLS paper from last year for
a suggestion on how to let users effectively 'log in to' an existing
private mounts ns.

Ok, so it can use some very non-trivial fine-tuning...
But I've been using the above - minus the trivial gui - for over a year
without ever worrying about any of these short-comings.
