At the least.

I found the Unix structure and API much easier to deal with than
VMS. File versioning was just another complication that I sometimes
had to deal with (it was a *long* time ago, so don't ask for
details:-).
Funny thing about VMS. It was a much richer programming environment
(the OS had a lot of functions you could call), but I found that it
was easier to get stuff done with Unix, even if there wasn't some
fancy function to help you out. Unix gets in the way less, whereas
with VMS I found myself battling the API more to force it to do what I
wanted.
