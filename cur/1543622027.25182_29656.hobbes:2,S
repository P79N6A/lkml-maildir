I just returned from vacation and saw this thread.  I also need trylock()
routines for read-write semaphores for NFS version 4, but you're way ahead
of me: I hadn't even started to implement them yet, and have been working
around the deficiency.  So I would really like to see some variant of this
patch go into the 2.5.x series eventually.  Anything I can do to help out?
