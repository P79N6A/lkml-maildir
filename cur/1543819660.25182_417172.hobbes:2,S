Since it's quite likely that len > n will be true (e.g. after installing the
latest version of your debug tool) it would be better to silently ignore all
bits not within the range of NR_syscalls.
There is no point in flooding the console. The tracing process won't see any
of the non existant syscalls it requested to see anyway.
