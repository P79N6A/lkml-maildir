Hello,
I have a asus a6t with RTL8111/8168B 
PCI Express Gigabit and I have had a similar 
problem.
PCI-MSI-edge seems to break this ethernet card.
My card has stopped to work, I have powered off
my notebook for hours, but I am not been lucky, 
because it has showed up only one time and then in 
next reboot with kernel  2.6.23 is disappeared again
(in this kernel there is not problem with this 
ethernet card ).
I have reflashed bios and  fortunately this card 
now works again. contacted one realtek developer, 
but he hasn't replied. I am been lucky 
to not send my notebook in repairing. 
It's very bad !
