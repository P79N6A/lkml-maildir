Could you explain a bit more about when b_private should and
shouldn't be used with this change?  We make use of b_private
within XFS, I'm just wondering if we will be stepping on each
others toes here?  And if XFS does need to use b_journal_head
instead of b_private with DM, maybe a more generic name like
"b_fsprivate" or something would be clearer?
thanks.
