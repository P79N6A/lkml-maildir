I'll post them as a "request for comment" tomorrow.  I'm still undecided 
about the best user space interface for using them.  At the moment, I 
have mechanisms to set them via /proc which is very handy for testing 
but not necessarily the best interface for general use.  Other options 
are via rlimits or a syscall.
