Just a note that I tried to boot 2.4.18-pre9-ac4 (plus Alpha specific
adjustments) on Alpha-Nautilus box.  Got stuck in that with:
..........
FAT: bogus logical sector size 0
FAT: bogus logical sector size 0
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:00
I have no problems booting 2.4.18-rc1 (with the same adjustments :-).
Anybody knows by any chance what this is about before I will start
digging?

PS. "Adjustments" mentioned above are required or I will not boot at all
with any current kernel but this is still WIP.
