Yes you can.  The way these applications work is to write all of the
data for a commit, and to wait for it to complete before finally writing
a commit record.  That way, provided the OS does not acknowledge the
write before it actually reaches the disk, the application can guarantee
enough about the write ordering to be sure about data consistency.  Raw
IO, O_SYNC and fsync() provide enough support for the application to get
this right, but fsync() does not provide guaranteed IO error
notification so is not sufficient in the presence of errors.
