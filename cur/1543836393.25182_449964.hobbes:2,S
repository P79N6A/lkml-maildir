Thx, for a db this seems natural...
I am very curious about ZFS as I think we will seem more protection in 
the FS layer as disks get larger...
If I have a very old file I am now half way throught reading and ZFS 
finds a bad block, I assume I would
get some kind of read() error...but then what? Does anyone know if there 
are tools with ZFS to inspect the file?
