Hi,
Your right - I didn't even look at the beginning of the module - since I 
was just compiling
it after upgrading to 2.6.17-1.2139_FC5.
 From the beginning of the file:
/*
 * dmi.c -- to get DMI information
 *
 * This code originally came from file arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c from
 * Linux kernel version 2.4.18
 *
Thanks,
Steve
