Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.0-test3-pre6 REPORTING-BUGS cleanup continued
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Paul <set@pobox.com> noticed an error in REPORTING-BUGS that I didn't.
Namely, the word "to" is missing from "Send the output to the maintainer...."
This patch, which is relative to my previous cleanup patch, fixes that.

 This explains what you should do with the "Oops" information to make it
 useful to the recipient.
 
-Send the output the maintainer of the kernel area that seems to be involved
-with the problem. Don't worry too much about getting the wrong person. If
-you are unsure, send it to the person responsible for the code relevant to
-what you were doing. If it occurs repeatably, try and describe how to
-recreate it. That is worth even more than the oops itself. The list of
-maintainers is in the MAINTAINERS file in this directory.
