If you really want to get pedantic..
"windows" is a plural noun, but "Windows" is a singular proper noun, and
in "Windows LDM" it functions as an adjective.  Using possessive here is
confusing because it suggests that this feature belongs to Windows, or
that it's part of Windows itself, but obviously it isn't (the feature
being referred to is part of Linux).  It is only *related* to Windows, so
the adjectival "Windows" is the best thing to use.

The "IBMs" plural construction is wrong since there is only one IBM.
"IBMs" can't be possessive because there is no reason not to use an
apostrophe to indicate possessive in this case.  Note that "IBM S/390
architecture" could be used, with "IBM" (a noun) functioning as an
adjective in the same manner as "Windows" above.  However, expressing the
notion of ownership/control ("IBM's") conveys more information then mere
association ("IBM"), so "IBM's" seems preferable here.
