The only problem with that is that is that (a) a complaint and a dollar
will get you a cheap beer, but this is Linux and no one *needs* to fix
it, therefore not breaking it becomes more important. The top developers
are not running legacy 386's, I bet. And (b) if the problem comes up
months from now, will anyone think to try timing changes for "every once
in a while" problems.
I really like the isa_delay() idea, or similar, which will be in a
single place and probably get enough attention to make it work. It just
sounds like a safer way to go with equal benefits.
