My question was maybe a little short. I don't doubt that we can shove a 
lot into the kernel, the question is rather how much of this will be 
unnecessary information, which the kernel doesn't really need itself.

A "I don't think anything more is needed" lets go off all sorts of warning 
lights. Most things start out simple, so IMO it's very worth it to check 
where it might go to to know the limits beforehand. The main question here 
is why should a kernel based solution be preferable over a daemon based 
solution?
If we look for example look at OS X, it has no need for user mounts but 
has a daemon instead, which also provides an interesting notification 
system for new devices, mounts or unmount requests. All this could also be 
done in the kernel, but where would be the advantage in doing so? The 
kernel implementation would be either rather limited or only bloat the 
kernel. What is the feature that would make user mounts more than just a 
cool kernel hack?
bye, Roman
