PGP at least (and I think GPG still) did overwrite keys before calling
free(), and attempted to use mlock().  Looks like ssh-agent doesn't use
mlock -- at least it hasn't in this case:
% grep Lck /proc/`pidof ssh-agent`/status
VmLck:         0 kB
% ulimit -a | grep lock
file size (blocks)         unlimited
core file size (blocks)    0
locked-in-memory size (kb) 32
file locks                 unlimited
Requiring security-sensitive apps to use a new flag to get safe behavior
is dangerous.  Better to be safe by default and turn on the
less-safe-but-faster behavior for the cases that benefit from it.

I still think that using uid in mm_struct is wrong, and some kind of
abstraction is required.  I called this "free pool" in
<20070628061911.GA16986@hexapodia.org>, but I think that name is
misleading -- I am not proposing that this should be part of the
management of free pages, but should be a label which abstracts "safe to
share freed pages among" groups.  Then different SELinux protection
domains would simply have different labels.
