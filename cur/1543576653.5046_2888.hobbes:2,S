That's another problem!
31 bit uid would be a nice feature for 2.4, but the last time I asked
Linus he answered that the high bits are still reserved.
My patch fixes bugs in the current, 15 bit implementation:
* we don't reserve any threads for root as 2.2 did
* if a user limit allows for > 10900 threads, then that user can cause a
deadlock by using all pid values (one thread can block 3 pid values).
get_pid() will loop forever.
* in theory, 2 threads could get the same pid.
