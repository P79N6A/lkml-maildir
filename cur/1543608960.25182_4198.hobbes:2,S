If both ext2 and ext3 are compiled into the kernel, then ext3 will try first
to mount the root fs.  If there is no journal on this fs (check this with
tune2fs -l <dev>, and look for "has_journal" feature), then it will be
mounted as ext2.  If you are doing strange things with initrd and modules,
then there is more chance to have problems.
I don't know why you would want to go back to ext2 if you have ext3 in your
kernel, but if so, there is a patch to add a "rootfstype" parameter which
allows you to select the fstype to try and mount your root fs as.  It looks
like it is in Linus' 2.4.13 kernel at least (don't know when it went in).
Cheers, Andreas
