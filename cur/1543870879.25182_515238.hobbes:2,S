No, only the "deadline" in the name is shared. This is a cpu process scheduler 
whereas the deadline scheduler you're thinking of is an I/O scheduler. To 
test this you just patch it in and it replaces the current mainline cpu 
scheduler (the same way the staircase cpu scheduler in -ck replaces it).
