Well, they're all accessed as memory locations within a special range of
addresses (all of 0xCxxxxxxx and 0xDxxxxxxx).  This includes the magic CPU
registers.  This is hard coded by the CPU before the MMU gets its hands on the
addresses, AFAIK.
I also wondered what about the boot wrapper (the kernel decompressor):  Is that
permitted to use readb() and co?
