Hi,
I would like to monitor the value of a variable in the kernel, How do I
print that to a file so that I can observe it at leisure..I guess it has
something to do with printk(..)
From what I see printk(..) writes to some log buffers which coule be
written to teh console depending on the importance of the messages...How
do I ensure that my numbers go to a file..?
thanks,
Arni
