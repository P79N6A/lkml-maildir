Umm - what's that? 
Please drop that immediately. 2.6.13 will hopefully have GFP_DMA32
on x86-64 that will make it fully obsolete.
And even before that you can use pci_alloc_consistent() - that
will do the right now and later.
... haven't read on.
But there seems to be a use of register_ioctl32_conversion. That
needs to be replaced with ->compat_ioctl, since the former
will soon go.
