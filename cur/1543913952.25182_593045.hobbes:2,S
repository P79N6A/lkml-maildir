Hmm. I must say I don't really like it.
Defining a callback function which itself takes a callback as an argument
looks like a conceptual weakness.
It's actually possible to solve it differently: We could insert a bio in
front of the bio list of the cloned request, which can take a pointer to
the request in it's ->bi_endio callback. This way, the bio can serve as
a meta-callback for the request and everything can be done there.
This way we don't have to change the interface at all and everything
works as expected.
I'll post a patch shortly.
Cheers,
Hannes
