That is the BSD way. Though there there are some devices that misbehave
(mostly third party drivers). 
Last time I checked Linux it did not have it. A lot of drivers keep track of it
(ISDn, Red Creek VPN, some ethernet drivers) but I could not find a generic
interface. From what I remember when trying to modify gated sources this
functionality is indeed not present. 
Pls correct me if I am wrong.
