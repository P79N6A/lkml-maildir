At the moment I'm thinking about returning to the patchbot project (by the
way, code *is* available now) and reworking it to handle both BK and GNU
patches.  The advantage of the patchbot is, it can do things like sniff
patches for NOTIFYMEONCHANGE directives, auto-CC a linux-patches list,
etc.  It could act as an accumulator of GNU patches into a BK repository,
waiting for Linus to pull, and in the interim, all interested observers
could also peek into the repository.
Hmm, I'm sensing a practical project here.

Yes, well that was never completely satisfying to say the least.  IMHO, BK
is helping improve the situation, but comes with its own issues, not all of
them technical.
