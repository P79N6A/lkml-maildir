The point Linus is makeing is that with pluggable schedulers there isn't 
competition between them, the various developer teams would go off in their own 
direction and any drawbacks to their scheduler could be answered with "that's 
not what we are good at, use a different scheduler", with the very real 
possibility that a person could get this answer from ALL schedulers, leaving 
them with nothing good to use.
