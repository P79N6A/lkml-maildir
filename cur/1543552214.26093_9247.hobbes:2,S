The system ran, but nothing moved. No process was able to do any activity,
because they were all waiting on swapped out space or waiting to use more
as-of-yet unallocated virtual memory. I could verify this because one of
my daemons writes one line to disk every 5 minutes. That stopped completely
during this event.
