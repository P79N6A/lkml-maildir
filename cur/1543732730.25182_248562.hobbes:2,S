I think actually the whole xtime initialisation
        xtime.tv_nsec = (INITIAL_JIFFIES % HZ) * (NSEC_PER_SEC / HZ);
is bogus. INITIAL_JIFFIES should not be connected to any actual time, so 
this should really just be
        xtime.tv_nsec = 0;
I'll try to do a patch later on, and see what happens. Have to do some  
work-related things now.
