No contest there. The software engineering process these people have to
go through so that the ATC software is approved is extreme. However, if
you talk with air traffic controllers or read articles on them, you'll
know that their systems are far from ideal.
Old code is great when it works, but we are pushing the limits of that
code even now.

Critical life-dependent systems will always be special. You'll never go
out and get the "latest" upgrade unless it's be thouroughly tested.
Various federal agencies regulate this rather tightly.
