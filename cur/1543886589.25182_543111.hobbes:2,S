What I was really going on about was that quicklist freeing can't
enforce any high watermarks in the future because it must wait until
the TLB flush unless it's guaranteed that TLB flushes are done prior
to quicklist freeing (which is furthermore required for other reasons,
to be described in the sequel).

I described it as motivated by such, not really correctly handling it.
I didn't bother analyzing it for correctness. I'm not surprised at all
that the TLB flush can be missed where it now stands in the patch. I
wanted to move it to tlb_finish_mmu() all along, along with quicklist
management of lower levels of hierarchy.
quicklist_free() with unflushed TLB entries admits speculation through
the pagetable entries corresponding to the list links. So tlb_finish_mmu()
is the place to call quicklist_free() on pagetables. This requires
distinguishing preconstructed pagetables from freed user pages, which
is not done in include/asm-generic/tlb.h (and core callers may need
to be adjusted, pending the results of audits).
To clarify, upper levels of pagetables are indeed cached by x86 TLB's.
The same kind of deferral of freeing until the TLB is flushed required
for leaf pagetables is required for the upper levels as well.
