	In linux/kernel/signal.c you will find definitions of 
	signal_queue_cachep;	/* The 'system' rt signal queue - I think. */
	nr_queued_signals;	/* The current rt signal queue depth.
				   aka: /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr */
	max_queued_signals;	/* The max rt signal queue depth.
				   aka: /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max */
	While attempting to debug my process, I've found myself
	filling the rt signal queue (nr_queued_signal==max_queued_signals).  
	I would expect this problem to correct itself when the
	offending process terminates (I got the impression that
	flush_signals() was called at process exit time).  This
	evidently does not happen or more likely, it doesn't happen
	if the process crashes.

	It looks like do_sigaction() does the same traversal of the rt
	queue that flush_signals() does, so you are right.  This
	doesn't help me in the case of a process that crashes with signals
	pending though.
