I had an other oops today...
I was "playing" with something, and was doing about 1000 connections from
1 process to an other. After some time I was unable to fork anything. I
killed the process doing the connections, and then got this a few seconds
later:
kmemfree: Bad obj addr (objp = c26a9720, name = tcp_open_request)
kernel BUG at slab.c:1651!
Didn't write the rest down. 
I did the same before and after this, but it only crashed once so far.
