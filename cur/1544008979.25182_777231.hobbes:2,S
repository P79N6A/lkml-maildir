Yes it does.
There are hundreds of possible interleaves in kernel
source today.  Adding a couple more isn't horrible.
The changes Matt proposes are good because they make the
kernel image smaller with a very minimal chance of
deciphering difficulty.
Someday there'll be a "multiline_printk_start/end"
mechanism that will avoid interleaving.
