Sorry, I thought general users push reset button when the machine is
panicked. :-(

My motivation is very simple. I want to use both kdb and kdump, but I think it
is too weak to satisfy kexec guys. Then I brought up the example enterprise
software. But it isn't a lie. I know some drivers which use panic_notifier.
IMHO, they use only major distribution, and they has the workaround or they
don't notice this problem yet. I think they will be in trouble if all
distributions choose only kdump.
BTW, I use kdb and lkcd now, but I want to use kdb and kdump. I sent a patch to
kdb community but it was rejected. kdb maintainer Keith Owens said,

Then I gave up to merge my patch to kdb, and I tried to send another patch to
kexec community. I can understand his opinion, but it is very difficult to
modify that kdump is called from panic_notifier. Because it has a reason why
kdump don't use panic_notifier. So, I made this patch.
Please do something about this problem.
Thanks,
