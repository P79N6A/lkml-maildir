I know, but i hopefully also have a good reason to do so... First, the 
attributes provided through these functions are for accessing the 
firmware... The controller has a little limitation, it could only handle 
64 blocks, but sysfs only have 4k...
Now there are two options:
1) when writing: read a 64k block, merge it with the 4k block and write 
it back, when reading: read a 64k block and only return the needed 4k block.
2) extend the sysfs attribute to allow 64k blocks
IMHO the first is not a very good solution, because for a 64k block it 
has to be written 16 times...
Of course if someone finds a better solution i would be glad to hear 
about it...
Thank you very much.
Best regards,
Markus Lidel
