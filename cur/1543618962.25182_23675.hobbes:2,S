How did you find big inlines? Care to share hunter script with me (+ lkml)?

And what if later you (or someone else!) add another call? You may forget to 
remove inline. It adds maintenance trouble while not buying much of speed:
if func is big, inline gains are small, if it's small, it should be inlined 
regardless of number of call sites.

Small in asm code, _not_ in C. Sometimes seemingly small C explodes into 
horrendous asm.

How much less small? We can have both:
inline int f_inlined() { ... }
int f() { return f_inline(); }
...
f_inlined(); /* we need speed here */
f(); /* we save space here */

100%. Especially when some "cute small functions" called inside happen to be 
inlined too (or are macros).

Homehow I feel there are more :-)
