I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.  Yes, my driver is working just 
fine, apart from these conceptual difficulties in getting O_DIRECT to 
perform.  (Without the O_DIRECT, it works perfectly -- other than not 
bypassing the page cache.)
I did what you suggested: current->mm = mm_alloc().  (I had to change
kernel/fork.c since mm_alloc() isn't EXPORTed.)  The call to init_rwsem()  
isn't needed because mm_alloc() calls mm_init(), which does it.  That much
succeeded.  But what about setting current->active_mm?  What about undoing 
the effect of enter_lazy_tlb(), which is called indirectly by daemonize()?  
Or does it not need to be undone?
In the end, your suggestion didn't work.  Subsequent calls to vfs_read()
returned -EFAULT, which obviously isn't useful.  I know very little about
the intimate details of Linux's memory management; is it possible that the
EFAULT occurred because my I/O buffer is in kernel space rather than user
space?  My kernel thread does execute set_fs(get_ds()) before doing much
else.  But the direct_io path seems to do some involved memory-address
calculations; is it only meant to work with user-space buffers?

Yes, my thread does need to exit.  To what linked list do you refer -- one
based on init_mm?  Is the mm->mmlist member of my structure the part that
should be linked in, as dup_mmap() does?  What about all the other stuff
dup_mmap() does, that my driver doesn't do?
Simply exiting without doing anything else was disastrous.  The system got
caught in an uninterruptible error loop.
