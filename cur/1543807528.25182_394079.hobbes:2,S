Should be true for most CPUs with integrated memory controller.
Anyways, the 2 was just an example, true number would probably
need to be found with benchmarks.

The benefit would be to not fill up the local node as quickly when
you do something IO (or dcache intensive).  And on contrary when you
do something local memory intensive on that node then you won't need
to throw away all the IO caches if they are already spread out.
The kernel uses of these cached objects are not really _that_ latency 
sensitive and not that frequent so it makes sense to spread it out a 
bit to nearby nodes.
