Do the intel docs guarantee it works on i486 and higher, if so SMP athlon
will be the only check needed for the SMP users. You work for an x86 chip
cloning company so if you say it works I trust you 8)

I've not seen incorrect TSC detection in 2.2, do you know the precise
circumstances this occurs and I'll check over them. I've also got no
bug reports of this failing.
check_config would also panic with the 'Kernel compiled for ..' message 
if it occurred.
