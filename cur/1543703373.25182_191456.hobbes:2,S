A similar problem shows up on 2.6.1 with smbfs, owing to silly block
counts:
$ ls -l 5glogo.avi 
-rw-rw-r--    1 1000     500        148640 2002-09-01 13:38 5glogo.avi
$ du -h 5glogo.avi 
512M    5glogo.avi
$ stat 5glogo.avi 
  File: `5glogo.avi'
  Size: 148640          Blocks: 1048576    IO Block: 4096   regular file
...
Reported to the smbfs maintainer a while back.
