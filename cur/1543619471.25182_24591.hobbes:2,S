Both ESR and I definitely know about this process but kbuild is one of
the awkward systems that affects the entire kernel.  The final kbuild
system goes straight to Linus, there is nobody else to send it to.
kbuild 2.5 must match the current makefiles and config settings before
it can go in so it is impractible to target anything expect the
standard kernel, there is far too much work involved in tracking
makefile and config changes in -ac, -dj, -whoever.  Even if kbuild was
done against another tree, it would have to be redone and reverified
before sending to Linus, there is no way to extract kbuild 2.5 from a
divergent tree and expect it work on Linus's tree.
