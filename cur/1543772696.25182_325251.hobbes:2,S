An ext3fs is always utf-8. People might have chosen to put other
encodings on it but thats "not our fault" ;)
There are some good technical reasons too
Encodings don't map 1:1 - two names may cease to be unique
Encodings vary in length - image a file name that is longer than the
allowed maximum on your system with your encoding choice - that could
occur with KOI8-R to UTF-8 I believe
That said it ought to be possible to use the stackable fs work (FUSE
etc) to write a layer you can mount over any fs that does NLS
translation.
