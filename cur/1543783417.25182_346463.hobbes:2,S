Well, then we overflow.

We just don't have much more then 4 seconds worth of bits there. So I
don't know what your suggesting. Granted, my patch is a bit paranoid, it
tries to make the casts more explicit so when something goes wrong, it
makes more sense (then, say, strange 70minute jumps in time caused by
the signed divide being implicitly cast unsigned).

That would only be necessary if update_wall_time_one_tick() could
increment tv_nsec by more then 1 billion. That seems to be a touch
over-cautious, considering we're already in a while loop.
