Hmm... we interpret the spec as /64 prefix.

I have cisco box which installed IPv6 IOS.
But it defines no prefix length at an interface,
FastEthernet4/1 is up, line protocol is up
  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80::201:64FF:FEA3:ED55
and outgoing interface of routing table is NULL ? :-)
L   FE80::/10 [0/0]
     via ::, Null0, 7w0d
