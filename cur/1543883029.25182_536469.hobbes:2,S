Yes.  lockdep has a way of working out if this task already has a
particular lock for reading or writing, but it isn't immediately obvious
how to extract that.
I guess a simple hack would be do do a down_read() on it.  If it's already
held for reading, lockdep should warn.  If it's already held for writing
someone will notice.
Oh well, it's not my top priority.
