Also, this is not meant for inclusion in it's current revision. It'll
need to have various compilation modes
(CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT/CONFIG_LOCK_STAT) combination enabled and such. I'm
handing this over to Peter Morreale and it'll be up to him to decided
what to do next.
However, it does work and should get interesting numbers for the
discussion of whether or not adaptive spins and friends are useful or
not.
