Hello, I have just been reading about a good place to
output oops'.  And the current problem being that the
information should be sent some where safe.
So i was thinking why not send it to the printer.  That
way you get a hard copy and no chance of corrupting the
root file system.
Appologies if this is unfeasible,
Michael O'Cleirigh
