That's weird, because "ö" (LATIN O WITH DIAERESIS) -- which clearly lies
outside the 7-bit range, is working on my system without myself poking the
kernel. Both hitting the key or using compose mode. This also applies to
A-with-DIAERESIS, U-with-DIAERESIS, sharp german S, but does not for anything
else, e.g. compose-'-e to generate E with accent aigu.

So am I. I have to use xterm for anything fancy now...
(especially for the even-more fancy stuff that begins at three-byte UTF8
sequences, such as Japanese :-)
