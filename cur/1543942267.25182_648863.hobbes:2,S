Eeek!  Why?  What's wrong with individual files here?  What's to ensure
that you aren't going to overflow your buffer?  There's a reason we
don't have the seq file interface for sysfs, to prevent this very kind
of thing...

Nope, no error checking, fun chance of blowing the memory buffer :(
Please change the interface to not do this.
Oh, and for every new sysfs file, you need a Documentation/ABI/
addition, please also add that.
