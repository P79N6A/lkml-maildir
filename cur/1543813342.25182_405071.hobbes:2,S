Yep, I will. I am afraid, I lied to you at one place - as I said that 
2.4.32 didn't work either. I tested 2.4.32, but used drivers from 
alsa-driver-1.0.3. I wasn't able to compile any recent version of 
alsa-library against 2.4.x native alsa drivers. I might try some older 
version of alsa-lib. I'll try to put as much information as possible in 
the bug-report.
Thanks
Guennadi
