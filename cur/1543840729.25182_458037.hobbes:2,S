The GDT only gets touched once in cpu_init(), and %gs is reloaded on 
every kernel entry, so I don't think that's it.  I seems to have 
interrupt issues with SMP.
And either way, it still doesn't work on real hardware...

Yeah, I'll have to try that out.

Well, it has to be arch-specific per-cpu data, since the PDA is arch 
specific.  But there should be various pieces of interrupt state that 
adapt well to it.

Yeah, that wasn't really a serious thought...
