No, user needn't to do anything. Just turn that default y option really to y 
(yes, you are right, the help text of this option is misleading...). It's like 
you turn off old acpi events option and scream that you acpi daemon doesn't work 
for instance. There are many instances of this behaviour in the kernel. And yes, 
many people don't need that option tuyrned on -- I think we need not-y testers 
too, but it might be my personal feeling.
