It will be a major security vulnerability.

Mapping fails in this case due to UID loops (been there done that too - had to
spend a week changing uids because of it - most were quickly changed because
there was no conflict, but about 100 out of 1000 were in loops. Users had
multiple accounts on both machines, but different uids on each. You can end up
having to map the same uid to two different uids.
