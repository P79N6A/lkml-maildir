Great work Satyam.
Personally I hate all the build warnings we get and, just like you,
once in a while go on a warning killing spree. It's just so much
easier to spot the real problems when the build doesn't spew a ton of
pointless warnings.
Thank you for doing this, I hope some of your patches get merged.
Btw; it would be easier to see if one has got all the patches if you
numbered your patch series with the usual "[PATCH XX/YY]".
