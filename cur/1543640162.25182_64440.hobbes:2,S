My floppy refuses to mount under 2.5.31.
The first attempt leads to segmentation fault.
The second attempt leads to an unkillable
(killall -9 mount as root has no effect) process which freezes on the 
open call:
stat64("/dev/fd0", {st_mode=S_IFBLK|0660, st_rdev=makedev(2, 0), ...}) = 0
open("/dev/fd0", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE
========================
Mounting floppies works fine under 2.4.
