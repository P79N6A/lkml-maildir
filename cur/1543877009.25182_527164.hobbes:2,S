Oh, right. Thanks for clarifing. I should have figured it out before 
I sent that mail.
To refine that example, you could replace the file with a large anonymous 
memory pool and a lot of swap space committed to it. In that case - with 
no ZERO_PAGE, would the kernel needlessly swap-out the zeroed pages? 
Perhaps it's an example too far-fetched to worth considering...
