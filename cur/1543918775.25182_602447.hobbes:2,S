No it is not.  That makes no sense.  The whole point of little endian  
is that you store LSB, then 2SB, then 3SB, then MSB and then when the  
CPU reads this as a 32-bit word it rotates them all around so that in  
the CPU register you have:
MSB_3SB_2SB_LSB
M765432L_M765432L_M765432L_M765432L
That is what little endian means and that is how shift operations can  
work fine on the CPU.
Best regards,
