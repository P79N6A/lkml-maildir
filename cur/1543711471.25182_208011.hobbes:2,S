No argument.  But their behavior, however awful, _was_ reported in 
places where a spec-driven driver would have noticed... :)

Everything _will_ always work, if you check the bits according to spec. 
     Not reporting the flush-cache feature bit, when it really the 
opcode exists, isn't a spec violation.  The opposite is, and I haven't 
heard of any such drives :)
AFAICS:
* for ATA versions where flush-cache is optional, you must check the 
bit.  otherwise, issuing flush-cache would be very unwise.
* for ATA versions where flush-cache is mandatory...  the argument can 
be made that issuing a flush-cache in the absence of the bit isn't a bad 
thing.  I'm not sure I agree with that, but I'm willing to be convinced.
"just check the bits" always works because it is the conservative 
choice...  but it can lead to suboptimal (but valid!) behavior by 
ignoring some devices' flush-cache capability.
If it's only a few drives out there that misreport their flush-cache 
bit, then who cares --> just more broken hardware, that we won't issue a 
flush-cache on.  If it's a lot of drives, that changes things...
