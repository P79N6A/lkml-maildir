This has been fixed now in 2.2.3.  2.2.2ac7 which contained the fix has
been running on a server that got the wait_on_bh lockups for 13 days now
without a lockup (but SCSI timeouts due to (I think) a bad cable that are
producing wait_on_bh messages).  Previously (2.2.2 and before) it would
lock up several times a day with wait_on_bh messages.
Previously the wait_on_bh messages also had the tcp_v4_hash() trace, so
perhaps there was also a socket locking bug that was fixed as Ingo
mentioned.  However, the SCSI timeouts were definitely causing lockups and
that has (also) been fixed.

We use EEPRO100s in over 20 servers here, and haven't had this problem
since 2.0 kernels.
