Are you sure the drivers/net/acenic.o file got compiled and linked
into the kernel? You are compiling everything statically which is a
problem on the x86 in particular when using the acenic driver as it
has a fairly large firmware image attached. Try compiling it as a
loadable module.

PS: Please try and post acenic reports to the acenic mailing lists,
gives you a better chance that I catch the reports due to the amount
of traffic on l-k.
