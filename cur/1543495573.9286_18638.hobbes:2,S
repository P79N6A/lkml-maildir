Very common. Nearly everything build these days supports IrDA and
nearly everything supporting IrDA can do much better than 115k200.

I do not know...

From my experiments with pc87108, it worked even from userspace. I
think modern hardware is clean enough not to be timing critical...

Yes, this would be nice. Initfuncting it is certainly not a problem.
