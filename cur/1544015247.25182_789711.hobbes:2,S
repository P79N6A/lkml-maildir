Hum... I just caught the release_sock(sk)/lock_sock(sk) done in skb_splice_bits()
So :
1) the release_sock/lock_sock done in tcp_splice_read() is not necessary
to process backlog. Its already done in skb_splice_bits()
2) If we loop in tcp_read_sock() calling skb_splice_bits() several times
then we should perform the following tests inside this loop ?
if (sk->sk_err || sk->sk_state == TCP_CLOSE || (sk->sk_shutdown & RCV_SHUTDOWN) ||
   signal_pending(current)) break;
And removie them from tcp_splice_read() ?
