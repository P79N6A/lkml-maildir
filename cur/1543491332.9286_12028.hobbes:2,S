Does anyone know anything about an SMC ISA ethernet card (10baseT) that
windows says is an SMC 8115T? A friend of mine picked up a few for really
cheap, but we were both surprised to find Linux doesn't seem to recognize
it.  The smc-ultra and ultra32 drivers don't detect it, and neither does 
the de4x5 driver.  Anyone currently working on a driver for these cards,
or am I missing something? 
thanks,
john.c
