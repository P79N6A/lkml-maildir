Now wouldn't it be great if we had one type of data
structure that would work for both the network layer
and the block layer (and v4l, ...)  ?
If we constantly need to convert between zerocopy
metadata type, I'm sure we'll lose most of the performance
gain we started this whole idea for in the first place.
