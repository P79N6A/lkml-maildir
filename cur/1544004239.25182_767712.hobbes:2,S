As I've already stated several days ago, I think that's the right
course of action.  Given all the concerns raised, it's clearly not
something that should have been allowed to become generic.
So, let's just close this discussion off by taking that course of
action.
What's required is (in order):
1. a local copy for NM10300 needs to be created and it converted to that
2. these two commits then need to be reverted:
bc173c5789e1fc6065fd378edc815914b40ee86b
b4f151ff899362fec952c45d166252c9912c041f
Then our usage is again limited to sched_clock() which is well understood
and known to be problem free.
