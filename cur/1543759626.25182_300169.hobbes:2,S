I think this one should stay exported (or at least be re-exported
immediately on demand).  It's used by the inline page_mapping() in
include/linux/mm.h, which _was_ used by various arch cacheflushing
inlines, which could reasonably be called from modular filesystems.
I think those architectures hit the missed export when the dependence
on &swapper_space got added to page_mapping(), the export was soon
added to mainline, but meanwhile they moved their inlines out-of-line
- perhaps temporarily, but not yet reverted.
Better leave it exported so long as page_mapping is using it.
