I just tried it on my laptop. I have a speedtouch usb adsl modem and
when it connects the computer freezes, around the same time that
messages are printed to the console showing that the ppp compression
modules were loaded.
Sysrq still works, I was able to get this trace form sysrq-p (sorry, no
other machine to dump netconsole output to), process id pppd:
EIP fn_hash_delete
ipv4_doint_and_flush
fib_magic
fib_del_ifaddr
fib_inetaddr
notifier_call_chain
inet_del_ifa
inet_insert_ifa
devinet_ioctl
inet_ioctl
sock_ioctl
sys_ioctl
syscall_call
I know it's a little short on debugging information but it's all I can
do for now
