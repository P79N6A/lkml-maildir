Yes, but allowing the administrator to easily unintentionally create
security holes in loading a security module defeats the whole purpose of
having modular security.

But this also means every security module has to handle the case of
being loaded after this time in the boot process interactively by
administrators.  That's very complex and race-prone.

Well, by excluding some policy you have to put more code in the kernel
in the LSM modules to handle being loaded at any time.  So, I don't
think the dogma of "no policy in the kernel" is a good one to follow
here:  it ignores the problem and creates new ones.
