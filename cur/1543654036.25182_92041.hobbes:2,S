nfs runs at 10mbyte/sec both directions for me, not on xfs if that
matters. can you try if you can reproduce with ext2 on both sides just
in case, also please try with 2.4.20rc2aa1 (the elevator-lowlatency will
make the system slower in some workload like dbench compared to rc1aa1,
but it doesn't matter for you since your bottleneck must be in the
network/fs layer not the blkdev layer).
