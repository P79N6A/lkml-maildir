yes, as said above it's linear with the number of virtual pages mapped
unless you use the objrmap to rebuild rmap.

allocated sure, but it has no information yet, you dropped the info in

how to unmap? there's no rmap. also there may not be swap at all to
allocate swapcache from

Tell me how you reach the pagetable from munlock to do the unmap. If you
can reach the pagetable, the unmap isn't necessary and you only need to
rebuild the rmap. and if you can reach the pagetable efficiently w/o
rmap, it means rmap is useless in the first place.
