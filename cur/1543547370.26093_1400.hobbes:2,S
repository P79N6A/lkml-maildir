This is probably just me being a bit dense, but I am having problems
understanding your comment. The code path affected by my patch (and
where the comment is placed) is not part of the do_expand code path
(the "Expanding ->truncate()" from your comment?). And in do_expand
we already set i_size=offset before calling truncate(). Which you
seem to object to?
I guess my question could be boiled down to: Do you think my patch
fscks things up? Or is this a general comment on things that should 
be changed?
