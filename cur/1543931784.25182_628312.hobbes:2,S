Hi Peter,
A major feature of this patch set is the network receive deadlock 
avoidance, but there is quite a bit of stuff bundled with it, the NFS 
user accounting for a big part of the patch by itself.
Is it possible to provide a before and after demonstration case for just 
the network receive deadlock part, given a subset of the patch set and 
a user space recipe that anybody can try?
Regards,
Daniel
