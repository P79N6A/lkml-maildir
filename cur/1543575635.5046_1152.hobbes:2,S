Hi.
I have a quite old cdrom drive, called Cyberdrive 240D. With linux 2.2.17
it worked with soemtimes odd behavior, but it worked.
With 2.4.0-test11 I can mount cdroms in it but if I want to access it (eg.
ls, cd...) I get messages like:
_isofs_bmap: block >= EOF (1096810496, 2048)
or 
_isofs_bmap: block < 0
However booting with 2.2.17 it works.
Here is info from ver_linux:

I tried the cruft mountoption, without success. What else could I do, or is
there no hope for this old drive?
Thank you.
