I can confirm that it's 100% reproducible.

As I suspected, the damn sysrq doesn't work (/proc/sysrq-trigger does, so it 
_is_ compiled in, sigh).
I'm only able to get swsusp output from the serial console:
Stopping tasks: ==============================|
Freeing memory... done (18812 pages freed)
PM: Attempting to suspend to disk.
PM: snapshotting memory.
swsusp: critical section:
..<7>[nosave pfn 0x588]......................................swsusp: Need to 
copy 11017 pages
suspend: (pages needed: 11017 + 512 free: 119862)
..<7>[nosave pfn 0x588]......................................swsusp: critical 
section/: done (11145 pages copied)
PM: writing image.
and it slows down _here_:

Here I have to press the red button unless I want to wait for a couple of 
hours.  I'll send you more info when there's more.
