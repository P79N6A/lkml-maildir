It doesn't have to be a struct device, either. 
What describes partitions, struct hd_struct? By adding a struct 
driver_dir_entry (yes, crappy name; will change) and a bit of glue logic, 
we can create driverfs directories for them, and start adding attributes 
to the partitions themselves. 
Volume managers can have their own top-level directories, and one 
directory for each volume, with symlinks to the partition directories 
under the disk node directories that make up the volume. 
The code shouldn't be that bad, and I can whip something this afternoon, 
if interested..
