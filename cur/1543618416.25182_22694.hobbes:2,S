Hans-Peter,
as you have ACPI running already, you should have noticed that "your" clock 
(RTC) is in GMT time without a separate switch.
Mine is (compare with send time):
/home/nuetzel> cat /proc/driver/rtc
rtc_time        : 02:33:14
rtc_date        : 2002-01-24
rtc_epoch       : 1900
alarm           : 00:00:00
DST_enable      : no
BCD             : yes
24hr            : yes
square_wave     : no
alarm_IRQ       : no
update_IRQ      : no
periodic_IRQ    : no
periodic_freq   : 1024
batt_status     : okay
Regards,
	Dieter
