Just diving into the sources.
Is that something like:
if(!raw_irqs_disabled_flags) printk "irqs are enabled";
(At that moment it might have crashed already.. :-)).
I don't see the complete context yet, but I hope the irq is
triggered after the irq is somehow enabled.
BTW: the panic occurs on half of my boards on tyan S2891 with 2
opterons, of which the only difference seems to be the purchase
date (and hence probably the motherboard revisions). (Haven't got
time yet to pull them out of the rack and compare the
motherboards).
