But this is still only 4 additional bytes per policy on 32bit NUMA.

Well the ability to set bits for policy controlled allocations may come in 
handy if we want to support memory policy controlling some other aspect 
for page allocation.

That would work for MPOL_BIND. How about MPOL_INTERLEAVE with a restricted 
set of nodes? cpusets may cause any policy to have a restricted nodeset.

Hmm.... Maybe make this a separate post?

zone_reclaim can be configured to write out dirty file cache pages during 
reclaim. So this could be addressed.

Hmmm.. We could now add some other control bits to the mempolicy gfp 
mask to affect the behavior of the page allocator.
