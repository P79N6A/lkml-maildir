Coda already do what you want:
Files are kept on a server, and copied to your local disk when
you use it.  You may even disconnect when working on the local
copy - your changes will be propagated back to the server
whenever you reconnect to the network.
The copying is indeed completely transparent.
If you need reservation - use the permission system. 
A suid program simply makes _you_ owner, and only
the owner gets write permission.  This is your check-out
program.  Check-in consists of changing ownership
back to root (or some userid allocated to the versioning system)
