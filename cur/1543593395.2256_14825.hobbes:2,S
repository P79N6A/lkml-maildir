Hi
I have an old SCSI card that came with old HP scanner. It contains NCR 53c400a chip, one 3pin jumper and some PAL logics. I tried
modprobe g_NCR5380 ncr_53c400a=1 ncr_addr=0x280 ncr_irq=255 as described in kernel docs, and it writes No device always.
It works fine at address 0x280 under Winslows. Is there a chance to make it working under Linux 2.4.x?
Tomas
