	Hello Narancs ,  Try a google or altavista on KZPSA .
	I found quite a few mentions for the device .  Another thing to
	try is to look the board over very carefully & see if it might be
	actually made by another company & just re-stamped with the DEC
	name & partno. ,  Like the DAC960's were renamed to KZSPC's by
	DEC .  Hth ,  JimL
