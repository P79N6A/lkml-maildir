looks really good to me!

small nit:
+       vc->vc_color = printk_color;
+       update_attr(vc);
that should be in a set_vc_color() function and the new code should do:
+	set_vc_color(vc, vc->vc_color);
(and same at the other places that call update_attr() as well)
feature request: would be interesting to have a color table (defined in 
the .config) dependent on message loglevel. That way KERN_CRIT messages 
could be red, KERN_INFO ones white, etc.
