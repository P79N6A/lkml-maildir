	Not...
	A standalone separator is a totally different issue...
	Try this:
alcove:~$ echo foo > foo
alcove:~$ cat foo
foo
alcove:~$ cat foo''
foo
alcove:~$ 
	This is also not the same thing since '' is not a character at all...
But appending a '/' is appending a character, and that's a difference.
	I also think that Linux handles trailing slashes in a preferable
maner.  Is there anything in POSIX which speaks to this issue?  If there
is, it should be settled and we can say one is right and one is not.  If
not, it's vendor implimentation dependent and we can all claim to be "right".
