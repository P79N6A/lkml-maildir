  FWIW, I can reproduce this message easily, by using 'lprm' too fast.
I'm currently printing a lot of pictures, and  had to change the cartrigde so
I removed all the mail jobs by lprming rather fast until all jobs were killed
and this message appeared every time I call lprm too quickly after the previous
one finish. I had to wait 1/5 second between each lprm.
    Hope this help.

P.S. to David S. Miller: Are you still working on the 
_isofs_bmap: block >= EOF (1111, 2203608)
bug? Do you mean me testing something?
