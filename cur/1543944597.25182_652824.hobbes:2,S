I rename acpi_parse_sbf() to sbf_acpi_parse() because the function was
moved from arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c, where pretty much all functions
are named acpi_*() to the file arch/x86/kernel/bootflag.c, where all
the functions are named sbf_*(). However, I don't mind reverting that
renaming, I just thought it was cleaner, but I have no strong opinion
on it.
Any thoughts about the duplicate call to
acpi_table_parse(ACPI_SIG_BOOT, acpi_parse_sbf) ?
Thanks for your comments,
Thomas
