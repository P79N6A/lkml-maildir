BH_Req is never unset until the buffer is destroyed (put back on the freelist).
BH_Req only says if such a buffer ever did any I/O yet or not. It is basically
only used to deal with I/O errors in sync_buffers().

Either your debugging is wrong or you broke try_to_free_buffers because a
buffer with BH_Req must still be perfectly freeable.
