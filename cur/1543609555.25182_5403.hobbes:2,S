I don't think that would help at all... With the current file/dir allocator
it will choose a new block group for each directory no matter what the
parent is...
The new allocator would spread them accross the different block groups only
if they are created *directly* off of the root of the FS. Your idea would
make things worse for the new allocator *if* the tree is uncompressed into
the root of the FS, and *no* difference if not...
