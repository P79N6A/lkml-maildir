Oh, both are work-aroundable, no question about it. The same way it was 
possible to work around the broken aliasing with previous releases. I'm 
just hoping that especially the inline thing can be resolved sanely, 
otherwise we'll end up having to use something ugly like
	-D'inline=inline __attribute__((force_inline))'
on every single command line..
(I find -finline-limit tasteless, since the limit number is apparently
totally meaningless as far as the user is concerned. It's clearly a
command line option that is totally designed for ad-hoc compiler tweaking,
not for any actual useful user stuff).
