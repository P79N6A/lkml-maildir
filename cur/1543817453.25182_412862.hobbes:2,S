The usage so far that I can see for
  smp_mb__before_clear_bit()
  clear_bit
is to close a critical section with clear_bit.  I will be hard impressed
to see a usage that allows stuff follows clear_bit to pass clear_bit, but
not to pass the smp_mb_before_xxx.
<end of critical section>
  smp_mb_before_clear_bit
  clear_bit
<begin other code>
But if you stand on the ground of smp_mb_before_xxx protects clear_bit
from occurring before the "end of critical section", then smp_mb_before
is such a brain dead interface and it is another good reason for having
an explicit ordering mode built into the clear_bit.
