Definitely. It would be really good if we could have interactivity
regression tests too (see my earlier wishful email). The problem
with a lot of the scripted interactivity tests I see is that they
don't really capture the complexities of the interactions between,
say, an interactive X session. Others just go straight for trying
to exploit the design by making lots of high priority processes
runnablel at once. This just provides an unrealistic decoy and you
end up trying to tune for the wrong thing.
