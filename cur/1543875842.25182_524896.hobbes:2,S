No, it seems to be looking at 0 because ata_read_native_max_address_ext 
returns 0 in the error case - the error that ata_exec_internal generates 
seems to be AC_ERR_HSM. Since 0 isn't > the size reported, we'll never 
try to resize it anyway, judging by ata_hpa_resize - that is, it seems 
to be the ata_read_native_max_address_ext call that breaks it.
