I'm _not_ seeing errors; see below.
System 1 is P200 w/IDE, two AC22100H drives, striped swap.  Bootup says:
PIIX3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe800-0xe807, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xe808-0xe80f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: WDC AC22100H, ATA DISK drive
hdc: WDC AC22100H, ATA DISK drive
BTW, this is with IDE DMA _OFF_.  It's normally on, but when I upgraded to
2.2, it is now off by default and I forgot to turn it on.
System 2 is Alpha EV45 w/ncr53c810 and Micropolis SCSI-II.  Bootup says:

I ran several tests on system 1 with 100000k files from both /dev/zero and
/dev/urandom, copied to and from both the same drive and the other drive.
I never got any compare errors with cmp -l.
I also tried it on system 2 with 120000k files from one of my raw
partitions and also never saw a mismatch with cmp -l.
Again: I did not see any problem.  System  1 has been running for 23 days
under busy load and with lots of disk activity (G's of data touched).
