Ahhh, I missed that. I interpreted:

as "for block devices we don't, for normal files, yes", but apparently 
that's not what you meant. :-)

Nice piece of info. Apparently all of the "large" database engines can 
use fdatasync, only the smaller ones (bdb, sqlite) don't. I've done some 
extra research:
* From a quick look at the docs it seems to me that bdb can't be 
configured to put its transaction log directly on a block device, so bdb 
won't be affected.
* SQLite definitely can't write logs to a block device, the docs 
explicitly say that the transaction log is a regular file with a 
specific name, so we can write off sqlite as well. (It does seem to use 
fdatasync btw, since version 3.2.6, see 
http://www.sqlite.org/changes.html.
)
If we've missed none, that leaves only proprietary databases at risk. 
But I would be genuinely surprised if a database like Oracle would use 
fsync. If we assume that Oracle et al. are not a problem, the risks of 
this patch are very low.
Cheers,
Bart
