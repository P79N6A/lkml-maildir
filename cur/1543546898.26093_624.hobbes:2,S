Hi there,
I think there is a problem in ide-cd.c? It determines the same
(magic number) as for toc-capacity for ALL DVDs, which is 449849
no matter what the size of DVD. Which is, off course too small,
barely enough to handle only the first video file for most of the
DVD titles. It works fine for CDs.
I don't know where the problem is, probably in cdrom_read_toc
function (I'm not a kernel expert). As for quick&dirty hacking, I
changed ide_cdrom_revalidate as folows:
/*HWIF(drive)->gd->sizes[minor] = toc->capacity * BLOCKS_PER_FRAME;*/
HWIF(drive)->gd->sizes[minor] = ide_cdrom_capacity(drive) / 
                           SECTORS_PER_FRAME * BLOCKS_PER_FRAME;
ide_cdrom_capacity seems to be working fine. However, the source
of problem still needs to be identified.
