Takashi-san, thank you for your updated patch.  This looks very good, with
only a couple of minor issues.
Ted, Stephen, which field should be used to extend the i_blocks to 48 bits?
It should be OK to use the l_i_frag and l_i_fsize fields, since they are
otherwise unused.  I believe "linux2.i_pad1" is already used for the
i_file_acl block number extension.

Why is it that PAGE_SIZE is suddenly changing from unsigned to unsigned long?
This patch can be included into the patch series that Mingming has posted,
which is including many of the fixes you have posted, but this one is an
important addition, as is the change to allow larger block sizes on
architectures that support it.

Please put operators at the end of the line.

This part should all be conditional upon RO_COMPAT_HUGE_FILE not already
being set in the superblock.  It might make sense to put this into a
helper function and call it from here and also where RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE
is checked.  We can probably remove the printk entirely.

This doesn't take into account that there will be some number of extra
blocks on the file for {dt}indirect blocks.  There was some discussion
among ext3 developers to use another field in the inode to allow the
i_blocks count to grow up to 2^48 bits in conjunction with this patch,
which will remove any worry about additional metadata blocks and also
allow future growth without yet another COMPAT flag.

Instead of indenting so deeply here, this could just be a single condition:
	if (EXT3_HAS_RO_COMPAT_FEATURE(sb, EXT3_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_HUGE_FILE) &&
	    sizeof(root->i_blocks) < sizeof(u64) && !(sb->s_flags & MS_RDONLY))
		printk(KERN_ERR "EXT3-fs: %s: Filesystem with > 2TB files must "
		       "mount read-only without CONFIG_LSF\n", sb->s_id);
