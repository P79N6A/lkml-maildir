In part I agree.  I would have preferred to make my change in one
place instead of one driver at a time.  On the other hand, it seems to
me that some of these details are already spread around all the
drivers.  For instance, why does every driver have to call
eth_type_trans?  Could that be delayed for netif_rx ?
I do think it's reasonable for a driver to test whether the upper
layers are ready to process another packet.  I suggest that this 
test be encapsulated into a new function that can be changed at the
cost of only recompiling all the drivers.
