Hi.
I have the same issue on Acer Aspire 1520 notebook. On SuSE 9.3 system
can not boot with acpi=off.
In 2.6.13-rc4-git4 this crazy touchpad jumps reports as:
warning: many lost ticks.
Your time source seems to be instable or some driver is hogging interupts
rip handler_IRQ_event+0x20/0x60
and sometimes I can see 
psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio4/input0 lost sync at byte N 
This happens when some software check battery state or current cpu
rate too often.
