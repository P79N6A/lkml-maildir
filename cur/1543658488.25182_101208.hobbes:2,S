...because only clients that are currently holding POSIX locks will have an 
entry.

The file should get deleted every time the client releases all locks and 
successfully manages to notify the server that it is stopping monitoring.

As I've told you before: 'stale' entries, as you call them, indicate that the 
rpc.statd never managed to notify the server that it should stop monitoring. 
It indicates either the server or the client crashed before the POSIX locks 
held by the client got released, or possibly that the rpc.statd processes 
crashed (or got 'kill -9' ed).
