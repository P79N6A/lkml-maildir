   Better than with swap. This is production workstation - I cannot test 
something on it :-(

    Sorry, I even marked $subject as [OT].
    I'm answering the question '2.4 without swap' - Yes. It is. Works. 
No  problems.
    <rant>'Paging like crazy' became for me a synonym of Linux. It 
doesn't matter how much memory you have. Less == worse. Developers 
stopped testing VMM regression on low-memory computers long time ago. 
<sarcasm>We have now fashion for clusters and numas. And a lot of swap 
on very fast raids. <sarcasm size=+100%>After all it is cheap. Just 
couple of thousands greenbacks. </sarcasm> </sarcasm> It was really 
funny when developers on LKML were sugesting to buy another hdd for 
swap. Very funny.</rant>
    Unfortunately I'm not a specialist in VMM...
    As I see there is not that much edge case testing going around.
