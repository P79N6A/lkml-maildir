Maybe if you looked at the new code model as a whole you would see that
the request-forking is gone.  The object is to preserve a copy of the io
instructions out to the registers to not have to repeat the do_request
call unless it is a do or die thing.  Also it is good to carry a copy of
the local request even if it is never used.  Also are you resetting the
pointer (back to the geginning) on rq->buffer on the retry?
You first flush the DMA engine and issue a device soft reset not using the
current drive reset, is presevers the hwgroup->busy state and allows the
request to be retried without reinserting.

I will have to poke in a few flags to verify this but if you say so.

Wrong location to poke and by that time it requires a full retry.
The new code would have had the task structs filled with the error.

In some cases yes, but it would be better if I had a standard counter that
meant something.  Also changing the jiffie counter in ide_delay_50ms to a
mdelay may have done more harm than good.
