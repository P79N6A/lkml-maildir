Yeah, I wasn't sure myself until I narrowed it down to a small test case.

It fixes some, but breaks others.  The test script I sent yesterday indeed
passes.  And more of my unionfs-on-nfs2 tests pass, but not all.  Three of
my unionfs tests (create w/ copyup, unlink open files, and unlink with a
whiteout) fail b/c they detect leftover silly-renamed files.  Worse, now the
same three tests also fail when I use unionfs on top of nfs3/nfs4: before
the one line fix below, unionfs-on-nfsv3/4 worked fine.
Was there any significant semantic change in the behaviour of silly-renamed
files in nfs in 2.6.24?  If so, then I may have to change how unionfs
handles refcounts and such.
I'll try to dig deeper and see if I can come up with a small test case that
doesn't involve unionfs.
Thanks,
Erez.
