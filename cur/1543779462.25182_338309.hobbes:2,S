The reason I really dislike this whole VM_FAULT_RACE thing is that there's 
literally just one user that cares, and that user is such a special case 
anyway that we're _much_  better off fixing it in that user instead.
The dirty bit thing is truly trivial, and is a generic VM feature. The
fact that s390 does strange things is immaterial: I bet that s390 can be
fixed much more easily than the suggested VM_FAULT_RACE patch, and quite
frankly, bringing it semantically closer to the rest of the architectures
is a _good_ thing regardless.
