hey, maybe it's time for me to repeat something that i'm often quoted as
saying:
  apache is about correctness first, and performance second.
i don't think that's silly personally.  remember most websites can be
served fine off an anemic 486/33 with one ethernet port tied behind its
back while doing a three legged race with a 6502 up a hill in san
francisco during el nino.
don't let the benchmarks fool ya!  it's generally more important that a
server be able to fork perl and parse CGIs fast than it is for it to
accept an extra 1000 conns/s.
apache-1.3.15 defines SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT on linux 2.2 and
later.  dunno when the release date will be... someone go find a security
flaw and it'll push up the release ;)  (p.s. and rbb promised to forward
the change into 2.0 and rse said he'd forward the change into mm, all of
which were based off the same code.)
