Hello,
Here is a small set of patches for x86. They are used by perfmon
but they can be applied independently.
patch 1: adds cpu_has_arch_perfmon to cpufeature macros to test for
architectural perfmon  on Intel processors
patch 2: adds AMD Northbridge config MSR definition
patch 3: adds AMD Northbridge PCI Id
Please apply.
Thanks.
