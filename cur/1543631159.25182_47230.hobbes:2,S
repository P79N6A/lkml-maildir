I don't see any reason to start using some fixed-mode semantics without 
seeing some stronger arguments on exactly why that would be a good idea. 
We have used up 11 of 24 bits (and more can be made available) over the 
last five years, and there are no obvious inefficiencies that I can see.
Also, stateful computing is usually a _bad_ idea. System calls that behave
differently depending on some external state should be avoided. Yes, it's
largely unavoidable if the external state is "we now emulate some other OS
behaviour", but that's not an excuse to create new such state, imnsho.
