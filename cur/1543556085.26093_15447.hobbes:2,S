But that potentially breaks devices that either don't use plugging
or alternatively implement their own, because q->plugged will not
get set and the unplug from __get_request_wait does nothing. It's
clear that the plug/noplug is too coarse. Anyway, I don't think
there's currently a problem with the old setup for any in-kernel
drivers so I'm fine with reverting to that behaviour for now.

Yes agreed.
