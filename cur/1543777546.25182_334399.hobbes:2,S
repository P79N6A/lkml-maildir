This is it. Apply it on top of -51-30 and 'make oldconfig'.
You'll be asked about the new CONFIG_ONE_IOAPIC. Answering yes, 
io_apic_one.c will be used, which is
((io_apic.c minus quirks) minus multi_io_apic_capability)
.
It'll propably crash some machines, as the quirks are there for some reason...
With CONFIG_ONE_IOAPIC unset, you'll get the same kernel as with my
previously sent patch.
have fun :-)
