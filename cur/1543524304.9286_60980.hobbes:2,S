You need 2.2.16 (which isn't out yet:-) or 2.2.13 +
   
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/oss/knfsd/knfsd-2.3.42-2.2.13-patch.gz
You then set the "nohide" export option when exporting all submounts.
NOTES:  1/ not all NFS clients will cope which this scenario - try it
           and see.
        2/ nohide is only effective on FQDN export entries - not on
	   subnet/wildcard/netgroup export entries. (I'll update the
	   exports.5 man entry to reflect this caveat one day soon).
