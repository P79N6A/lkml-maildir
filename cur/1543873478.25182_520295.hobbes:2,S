"delete" == remove from the list + kfree() as synchronize_irq() is not
going to prevent it for obvious reasons.
Of course, request_irq() and free_irq() are called for the same
/shared/ irq line but for /different/ handlers.
Looks too obvious to be true. I already expected someone prooving me
wrong, at the very least by pointing out a special option of vim to
activate some hidden synchronization code :o)
