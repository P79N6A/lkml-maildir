Hi Frederic,
Thanks for doing this work.
kmemtrace-user currently shows two main views: per call-site and
per-allocation. For the former, it uses a hashtable to accumulate
statistics. There's also a hashtable for individual allocations (by ptr
address), which we use to check for consistency for example ("if this is
going to be freed, has it been allocated?"). Apart from those two views,
it also shows global statistics.
	Thanks again,
