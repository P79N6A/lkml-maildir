Umm..what .. you get back here this instant .. Linus..come back here ...
Just kidding.
Just wanted to throw I out that I JUST experienced the same oops with netscape. I'mgoing to wait until Al submits a patch that he has gone over to see if it fixes the problem.
Also wanted to ask (because I'm still learning) if anyone knew which files have the potential to become corrupt. Is it only open files or can it also be files that aren't being accessed. The reason I ask is because my netscape prefs file contained half of my missing mailbox and I couldn't recall if I had opened netscape when the last corruption occured.
