Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: fix die_lock nesting

I noticed this when poking around in this area.
BTW, the comments in oops_begin say the operation is racy, and the only
way I can think of that is races is if you get a non-NMI oops then
get an NMI oops within the oops_begin or oops_end functions.
That can actually be fixed using compare-and-swap, but, to tell you
the truth, it just doesn't seem worth it to me.  If you like, though,
I can attempt a fix at that, too.  Anyway, the patch...
The oops_begin() function in x86_64 would only conditionally claim
the die_lock if the call is nested, but oops_end() would always
release the spinlock. This patch adds a nest count for the die lock
so that the release of the lock is only done on the final oops_end().
