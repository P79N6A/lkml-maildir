If I understand you correctly, you cannot tell me how EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL 
is an additional restriction according to the GPL.
OTOH what's wrong with enforcing a license?

What gave you the right to use the API or the implementation of this API 
in first place?

Why would you be forced to disable EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL? You can do that of 
course as long as you respect the conditions in the GPL, but that wouldn't 
require modifying EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.

Could you please explain how your binary module can be "reasonably 
considered independent", so that you don't have to distribute it under the 
GPL? How are boundaries of any importance, if you not allowed to use the 
GPL part in first place? Alternatively what gives you the right to ignore 
the will of the copyright owner and distribute the GPL part under your own 
conditions?

Well, what I have seen so far is that your logic stinks mightily and you 
are twisting reality to your own needs and on this way showing absolutely 
no respect for the work of others.
