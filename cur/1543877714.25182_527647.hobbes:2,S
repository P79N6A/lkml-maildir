I am aware only of apcupsd, nut and hid2hci.

Great. Do you use libusb to obtain raw hid events? Could you by any chance 
look at current implementation of hidraw (it's in -mm or I can send it to 
you as a separate patch) and check whether you have any comments on this? 
It would be good if you could use hidraw rather than reading raw usb data 
through libusb.
Thanks.
