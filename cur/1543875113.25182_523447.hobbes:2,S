Speeding up the unregistration is a very good idea, but this interface
is rather horrible.  It's almost a receipe for users to get it wrong.
Instead just changes the register and unregister functions to take
a NULL-terminated array of probes that get registered and unregisters
at the same time (and renames them from *probe* to *probes*, please)
