You should never sign off for somebody else.
You _can_ sign off as yourself, and just add a note of "From xxxx". That's
what the (b) case is all about (ie "to the best of my knowledge it's
already under a open-source license").
Of course, if it's a _big_ work with lots of original content, and you're 
unsure of exactly what the original author wanted to do with this, you 
obviously should _not_ sign off on it. But you knew that.
