Are you aware of devfsd? It keeps permissions for you across reboots,
and does it just fine.
The real limitation in this case is SCSI host numbers. There is no
way to permanently assign logical controller numbers like it happens
in other systems. add or remove another SCSI adapter and all your
names are shifted.
which is true for any adapter not just SCSI.
