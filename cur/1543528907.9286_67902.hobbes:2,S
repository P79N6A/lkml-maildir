Sorry to disturb you folks, but someone has pointed out to me
that there are some files (e.g. linux/drivers/net/bsd_comp.c)
which are licensed under the BSD license and not the GPL.
Whilst the Linux kernel itself is `meant' to be GPL'd, there
would appear to be some doubt about whether the GPL would allow
such files to be included (no sub-licensing, etc).  Has anyone
received legal advice about whether those files do in fact
represent a further restriction that would conflict with the
GPL ?  If so, can they still be (re)distributed with Linux ?
Afterall, it is not appropriate to just remove the offending
lines...
Darren
p.s. This is just to settle an argument elsewhere about this, so
I thought I'd ask the "experts"...
