You're right about the -rt tree not being an argument for upstream.  I
used it as an example of the complexities.  This is not limited to -rt,
but for any other changes as well.  Years ago I tried changing the slab to
run on a small embedded device with very little memory, and I was pretty
much overwhelmed.
Now I see that people are converting it for NUMA. I give them a lot of
credit, since they must be smarter than I ;)
