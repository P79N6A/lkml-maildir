I don't think you should evict it, since
 - you know the value it should have
 - if you do the hash lookup anyway, you might as well just update the 
   entry.
And it's not "read-only" - it's the "A" bit, not the "W" bit you should be 
clearing in "ptep_test_and_clear_young()".

I'll let Rik and Andrea argue that part - it's entirely possible that 
getting lots of positive results is a _good_ thing, if the same page is 
mapped multiple times. That would just make us less eager to unmap it, 
which sounds like potentially the right thign to do (it's also how the old 
non-rmap code worked, and I know Rik thought it was "unfair", but 
whatever).

Yeah, and it's unlikely to be a performance problem anyway. That function 
should be called only when we're low on memory..
