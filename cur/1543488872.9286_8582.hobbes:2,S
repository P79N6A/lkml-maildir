I just looked at the patch. It is almost small enough to attach below.
There is very little impact on the general memory management.
Almost everything is inside the ipc directory. The only other code
that shows up on a diffstat graph is an added function, not a change
to existing code. Much of the code is in a userspace daemon, with only
a few needed bits in the kernel.
I'd say you owe an apology to the DIPC authors.
The showcase application uses DIPC to distribute network monitoring
information. I'd say performance isn't the goal here at all.
DIPC is being used as an easy way to share data.
The next time you feel compelled to spew flames at a developer,
have the decency to read the code first.
