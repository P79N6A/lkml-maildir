Please read what I said instead of twisting the words! Get rid of the
current OOM _behaviour_ is what I said. The 2.0.* behaviour was fine.
2.2.* and up seem to indulge in random killing for no reason at all,
which I put down to false positives from a kill-happy something in
the kernel.
My boxes are _not_ out of memory.  They all have at least 64M, and all
have swap of at least 64M too.  They all run perfectly normal processes.
They have been doing this for years.  Switching away from 2.0.* kernels
caused them to start dieing like flies with dead inits, dead crons, dead
whatevers.  Only the lab boxes do this.  Personal workstations work
fine.  I presume the error situations are corrected without thinking by
someone sitting at a terminal who sees a poorly responding netscape, or
some such, or whose machine loses contact.  Left on their own, the
boxes are brought down by a killer presumably in the kernel,because
that diagnosis enabled counter measures that have been 99% effective
(to wit ... maintain key daemons from init, in particular cron, who has
to check other daemons too ..).

I don't have a problem. The current OOM behaviour does. If Rik's patch
mends it, then I am all for it.
