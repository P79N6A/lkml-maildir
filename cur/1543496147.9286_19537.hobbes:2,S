Hi Rik,
I've proposed to Linus a solution that IMVHO keep the code in schedule() 
a little bit cleaner.
This is what I suggest :
#define block_begin(f)	begin_##f:
#define block_end(f)	goto ret_##f
#define block_call(f)	goto begin_##f; ret_##f:
void schedule()
{
...
if (...)
	block_call(foo1);
if (...)
	block_call(foo2);
...
block_begin(foo1)
...
block_end(foo1)
block_begin(foo2)
...
block_end(foo2)
}
Cheers,
	Davide.
