I have acquired a digital RZ56, which seems to only want to do
synchronous mode.  With synch disabled, aha152x refuses to even talk
with the drive.  With synch enabled, I manage to detect the drive and
boot normally, but the first time I write to it (to write the
partition table from cfdisk) the system hangs completely.  I thought
I'd try 2.2.5ac6 to see if this might help, since I noticed in ac5 a
fix for the system hanging in aha152x.  However, this did not help. 
Still hangs. 
And yes, I read the part about synchronous mode not being ready yet in
the comments in aha152x.c.  But if the RZ56 really only does synch,
I have no other choice but to try it.
So if anyone could help me with either of the two following problems,
I would appreciate it very much:
- how do I put the RZ56 in asynch mode?  (or can it even do asynch?)
- how do I get aha152x.c to stop hanging the system when it writes
  to the RZ56 in synch mode?
Thanks,
Ben
