this fix is not complete - because the child runqueue is locked here, 
not the parent's. I've fixed this properly in my tree and have uploaded 
a new sched-modular+cfs.patch. (the effects of the original bug are 
mostly harmless, the rbtree position gets corrected the first time the 
parent reschedules. The fix might improve heavy forker handling.)
