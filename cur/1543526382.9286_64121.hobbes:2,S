Ok. I just checked once more. No, if there are no medium is inserted
"disc" entry is not created. Now I recovered the whole situation: I
inserted ZIP drive without partition table => ide-floppy loaded, disc
entry created. Then I tried to mount is as zip-win (i.e. not as whole disc
but as part4) and failed. Then I replaced it with proper zip disc with
partiton table and tried to access part4... Yes, most common problem is
fixed in recent versions of devfs. This one does not :-(( Of course it's
suble problem and so solution can wait :-)
P.S. BTW why both disc and part4 are there when ide-floppy is unloaded ???
Is it supposed to be this way ???
