From SingleUnix:
The vfork() function will fail if: 
      [EAGAIN]
            The system-wide limit on the total number of processes
            under execution would be exceeded, or the system-imposed
            limit on the total number of processes under execution by
            a single user would be exceeded.
      [ENOMEM]
            There is insufficient swap space for the new process. 
EAGAIN is the one you want, not EPERM.
