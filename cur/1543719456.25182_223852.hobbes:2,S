>============================================
Ethernet stopped working (for me) going from 2.6.7-rc1-bk3 to 2.6.7-rc2.
AMD64/asusK8V with onboard ethernet.
Dhclient tried to find dhcp server but no response.
Configuration by hand yielded same non-working situation.
Packets where "transmitted" but none received.
2.6.7-rc1-bk3 worked like intended.
