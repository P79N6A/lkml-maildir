I had already removed most of the "extern inline"s in the kernel since 
they give warnings with -Wmissing-prototypes (which I'd like to enable 
long-term in the kernel since it helps discovering a class of nasty 
runtime errors).
As far as I can see, all we need is "static inline" with the semantics
"force inlining" for functions in header files and perhaps a handful of 
functions in C files (if any).
