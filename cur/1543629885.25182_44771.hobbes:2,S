In some cases, the O(1) scheduler will produce higher latencies than
the old scheduler.  On 'some' workloads/benchmarks the old scheduler
was better because it had a greater tendency to schedule tasks on the
same CPU.  This is certainly the case with the lat_ctx and lat_pipe
components of LMbench.  Note that this has nothing to do with the
wake_up sync behavior.  Rather, it is the difference between scheduling
a new task on the current CPU as opposed to a 'remote' CPU.  You can
schedule the task on the current CPU quicker, but this is not good for
optimal cache usage.  I believe the O(1) scheduler makes the correct
trade off in this area.
Is there anything simple I can do to check the latencies of the
pthread_cond_*() functions?  I'd like to do some analysis of 
scheduler behavior, but am unfamiliar with the user level code.
