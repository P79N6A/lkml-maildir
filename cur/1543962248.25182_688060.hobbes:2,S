I think a warning is good enough here.  There are all sorts of warnings if,
which ignored, will crash your box.
And there is only one type which we use to hold processor flags and that is
unsigned long.
So a plain old
#define must_be_ulong(p)
	do {
		if (&p == (unsigned long *)0)
			;
	} while (0)
(or whatever)
should suffice.
