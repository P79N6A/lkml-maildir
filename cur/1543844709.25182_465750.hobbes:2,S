Yes, but your patch never applied to anything even remotely 
looking like the code in my tree. I got so frustrated that
I ended up reimplementing it in a cleaner way.
Now head.S calls i386_start_kernel() and that calls pda_init()
without any additional assembly code or other special cases etc. 
This is very similar to how x86-64 works.

I mainly did it to fix lockdep.
I used to do mcount hacks myself, but you typically need
a few special annotations for those anyways so I am not too 
concerned about them.

Yes no argument on that.
