I highly doubt that ioatdma could break a harddrive, as it is only
used by the networking stack.  Besides, the driver will only be useful
on a server type motherboard using a chipset that supports ioatdma.
This is not the case with a Centrino-based machine.
By the way, you might try checking the Maintainer's file to find out
who supports that module and copy them directly.  If they're at work
this week they might have a more official answer.
