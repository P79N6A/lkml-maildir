I'm trying to chase down a semaphore time-out problem.  I want to
sleep on a semaphore until either
(a) it's signalled, or
(b) some amount of time has elapsed.
What I'm doing is calling add_timer, and then down_interruptible, and
finally del_timer.  The timer's function ups the semaphore.
The code is in parport_wait_event, in drivers/parport/ieee1284.c.
Can anyone see anything obviously wrong with it?  It seems to
sometimes get stuck.
Tim.
