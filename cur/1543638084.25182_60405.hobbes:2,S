Your patch misses the reason why I created those functions: some
drivers had to always register with the major table. With your
"fixups", those drivers will break when "devfs=only" is passed in. If
you first fix the drivers so that they work without an entry in the
major table, then your patch is safe to apply.

Linus, please don't.
