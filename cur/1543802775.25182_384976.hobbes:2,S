I thought about this, and about moving other duplicated definitions from
asm-*/io.h in here, but I couldn't find any other obvious candidates, so
I wasn't anxious to introduce a new file.
If you think that's OK, though, it obviously makes the patch a lot
smaller, and gives a common place to put future cross-arch definitions.
I'll run another spin of the patch with your and Roland's suggestions.
