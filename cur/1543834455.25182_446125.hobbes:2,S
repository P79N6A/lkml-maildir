Hi Steven,
The way I understand the maintainership of the memory management code is
as follows: there is explicitly no maintainer listed. This code is so
sensitive and has interactions with so many other sub-systems that it
would not be doable to look at it from all possible angles by only one
person.
As it stands its more a group of people headed by Linus, Andrew and
Hugh.
