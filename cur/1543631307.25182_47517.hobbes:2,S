I should add one bit of information. I originally saw this problem on a
UP IBM Netvista machine, its the same box Greg had it happen on.
However, I have a 933Mhz PIII HP box at home and it does not
have the problem.
Since we are limited in the variety of machines to test on I am not
sure about this, but I believe its only going to occur on UP systems
with an IOAPIC.
If you apply the irq_balance patch to a 2.4.* kernel you can recreate
the same hang, in fact it was on 2.4.18 that i first ran into it.
I realize its kinda a corner case, running an SMP kernel on a
subset of UP machines, but hey, I figure its supposed to work :)
