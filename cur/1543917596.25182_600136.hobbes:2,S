Sorry, haven't had a chance to look at it in proper detail yet, mostly
due to debugging, but one thing I'd like to see is both the boot_params
structure as well as all the chained information pointers exported into
sysfs.  The experience with the x86 setup code has shown that it would
help immensely with debugging, not to mention being available to tools
like kexec.
