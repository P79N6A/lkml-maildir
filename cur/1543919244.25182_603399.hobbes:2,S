Thanks Jeremy, I've actually taken time to finally review this in detail (I'm 
assuming you'll refactor as necessary after the x86 arch merger).

I think this gives the right answer for the wrong reasons?

Do you actually need to define this?  See below...

Hmm, that's ugly.  It was ugly before, but it's uglier now.  Maybe just 
use "unsigned char ud2a[] = { 0x0f, 0x0b };" in paravirt_patch_default?

This is the bit I don't get.  Why not just declare struct pv_info pvinfo, etc, 
and use the declaration of struct paravirt_ops to get your unique 
offset-based identifiers for patching?
Rest looks fine...
Thanks!
Rusty.
