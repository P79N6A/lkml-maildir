Folks had code that supported AMD76x by banging the hardware directly.
On some AMD76x systems it caused corruption. Nobody AFAIK ever figured
out if it was an errata (nothing obvious in the docs/errata list) or a
bug in the code doing the banging on the chip or some other bit of
hardware on the mainboard that needed extra handling.
