No, that was about FIXUP_ESPFIX_STACK in fact.

Someone else added the .fixup section to UNWIND_ESPFIX_STACK,
and so the FIXUP_ESPFIX_STACK became used in that section.
I removed that now with my patch, unless someone can tell
me why it was needed.

Yes, but now the annotations had to be added, and so was the problem.

But why? FIXUP_ESPFIX_STACK doesn't pop up 20 bytes or something,
it just used to copy the entire stack frame from 16bit to 32bit
stack. It is much more than 20 bytes, but at the end, %ss:%esp
points to the very same data. So where exactly did 20 come from?
Well, historical interest mainly, as that code is going to die
when we agree on the patch, and the new code is much cleaner and
won't raise such a questions.

When it was written, such an annotations were not needed yet, so
I couldn't do that.
