Known problem, I'm afraid.  The PCMCIA Card Services layer
in a number of places is doing stuff from inside a timer
handler which it should not be.

It's best not to, really.  It'll probably appear to have
worked but your kernel could still fail in mysterious ways,
much later, very occasionally.
If you're using devfs, you could try disabling that.  Not
that this is a devfs bug, but disabling devfs reduces 
the number of functions which the buggy drivers call at
timer-interrupt time.
The bottom line is that we have a pcmcia_cs staffing shortage.
Somebody needs to go in, pull out the timers, use schedule_task().
