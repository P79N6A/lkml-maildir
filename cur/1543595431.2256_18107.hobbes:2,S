firstly, i better have at least one paragraph related to the kernel ;)
2.4 is a *much* better desktop than 2.2 for me.  make -j32 bzImage and
other large amounts of processes/io don't destroy the interactivity of
my X session anymore.
(wearing asbestos suit)
i have run, as full-time desktops, kde-1.x, enlightenment, windowmaker
and fvwm-* on 10baseT switched networks with Tektronix XP400 terminals
hosted on linux (and of course on xfree86-based normal linux desktops)
in both cases the better and "more interactive" window manager was not
fvwm or wmaker.  sure, E can be a pig with the right theme, but with a
nice lightweight theme it is great. E certainly seems lots better over
ethernet than the other two...
kde 1.x of course was absolutely ghastly over a network (gnome not too 
prominent in those days, so i didn't get a chance to try it)
lately i have been trying to make kde2 run smooth like my E setup, but
there are some niggles, and i wouldn't bother if i had less than 256mb
ram.
