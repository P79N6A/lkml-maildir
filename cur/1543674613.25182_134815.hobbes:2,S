Well, unsure about the problems I reported earlier - seems to be related
to modem disconnects during SDET runs ... the hung session seems to lock
up the system somehow. But that could have been around for ages - I'll
try to be more scientific about reproducing it at some point.
SDET results are about the same, kernel compile is down a bit on systime
(16-way NUMA-Q)
Kernbench: (make -j vmlinux, maximal tasks)

Not sure quite what that's all about, but there it is ;-)
