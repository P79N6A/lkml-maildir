I had made a few small changes in there and wanted to see if they compiled 
cleanly, but I didn't want to build cleanly and assumed that the build 
system would figure out any dependencies. Obviously I forgot to enable 
CONFIG_KEYS and thus the stuff in security/keys/ is not happy.

You are right. I had not looked into it that much, had I just tried to 
"make security/" I'd have seen that the stuff in security/keys/ did not 
build at all and would have realized my mistake. if the Makefile in 
security/keys/ also checked for CONFIG_KEYS it would have been even more 
obvious, but I guess that would just be bloat..?
In any case, there's no problem except for user error on my part.
