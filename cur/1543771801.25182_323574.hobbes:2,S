Dear all,
We are pleased to announce releasing a new dump analysis tool,
Alicia (Advanced LInux Crash-dump Interactive Analyzer).
---
The development of this program is partly supported by IPA
(Information-Technology Promotion Agency, Japan).

Alicia is a program that provides effective dump analysis environment
with power of Perl language. Alicia provides common access method to
kernel by wrapping the existing tool crash/lcrash and provides 
"scripting" function for saving and reusing the dump analysis procedures.
User can use existing crash/lcrash commands in addition to Alicia
commands. The command result can be saved as a variable and it can
be used as a parameter of another command. 
Please use this tool and give us some comments.
The following software is necessary for the compilation and the
execution of Alicia.
 - crash 3.8.5 or higher
 - Perl 5.8.0 or higher
