i've re-uploaded the -O2 patch with this fixed:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/preempt-timing-on-2.6.8-rc2-O2
but i'm still seeing some latencies:
 (kjournald/189): 997us non-preemptible critical section violated 100 us
 preempt threshold starting at journal_commit_transaction+0x642/0x2b10
 and ending at journal_commit_transaction+0x24ce/0x2b10
  [<c0105d7e>] dump_stack+0x1e/0x30
  [<c011ad0f>] dec_preempt_count+0x3f/0x50
  [<c01dfd3e>] journal_commit_transaction+0x24ce/0x2b10
  [<c01e3bf4>] kjournald+0x1a4/0x710
  [<c0102765>] kernel_thread_helper+0x5/0x10
these should not happen with vp=3 and max_sectors=16. Could you
double-check the patch above, does it have any other timing thinko?
