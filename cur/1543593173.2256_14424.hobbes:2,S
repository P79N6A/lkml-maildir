The mtime tells you exactly that.

I disagree. A non priviledged app should not be able to poke around in MII
registers anyway. So you only have to cache the generic state of the link.

You don't need timers.

You don't need any timers if you are caching. Zilch nada none. You know the
last time a query came in. The mtime lets the app know the last time the value
was modified.
