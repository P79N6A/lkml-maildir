The idea was that the kernel would generate a crash dump and then after
the reboot, a post-processing tool would do something with it. (e.g. run
the dump through crash to get a stack trace using separate debug info or
ship the entire dump off to a collection server or something).

netconsole requires a second computer. Feel free to mail me one. :)

Well, yes, but that has everything to do with how terrible kdump is and
nothing to do with the idea of crash dumps in general.
Anyway, we've strayed off topic long enough, I'm sure everyone in the Cc
list would be happy to stop getting an earful about the merits of crash
dumps.
