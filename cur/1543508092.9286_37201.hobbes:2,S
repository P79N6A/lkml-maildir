Depends what you mean by 'mapped' actually. My suggestion would be to
use it to determine the mtime to be presented, according to the
following rules:
 1. If the archive bit is set, anything asking for the mtime
    gets one of the following:
      a. The current time.
      b. The latest of the system boot time and the ctime time.
    Which is chosen would depend on the exact semantics required.
 2. If the archive bit is clear, anything asking for the mtime
    always gets the ctime time.
Perhaps somebody can advise what is wrong with that?
The only possible problem I can see is in the fact that there would
have to be some means to turn the archive flag off that worked with
the various backup programs and was consistant with the semantics
used.
Best wishes from Riley.
