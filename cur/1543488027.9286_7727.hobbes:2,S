Can the computer next to it on the same lan ping it ?
The reason I ask this is 2.2 is quiter than 2.0 with arp refreshs and the like.
Some buggy bridges hearing no traffic from a host forget about it (this is
the 'I run ping once every 10 minutes in cron, I have a 3com blah blah' bug 
for one example)
