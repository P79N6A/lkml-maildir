Hi again !
Just to say that I finally solved my problem. It came
from a wrong vmlinux.lds that had been modified by a
TUX patch applied to an earlier kernel sharing a hard
link with this one. Although I think an unlink before
a regeneration of this file would have been better,
I'll check around to see if there are other parts
which risk to modify a file on disk without previously
unlink it.
Now 2.4.16 works correctly on this 8MB 386.
Regards,
Willy
