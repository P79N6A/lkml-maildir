If you can predict ALL input in the pool, including the initial boot state
you can just rerun the PNRG algorithm and get the random numbers (as long as
you even can predict read access to the device).
But thats not the real-world Attack. The Real world attack is more to reduce
the randomness in terms of stochastic tests can detect some patterns like
unequal distribution or cycles. Those will lower the strengt of some
algorithms...
