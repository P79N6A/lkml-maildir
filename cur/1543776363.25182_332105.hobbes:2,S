Sorry I really have no idea. If you can retest with latest stable mainline 
that this kernel is based on (2.6.12.2) and reproduce the problem, then 
posting that info along with a summary of your 'lspci -vv' and 'dmesg' 
and .config might be helpful as out-of-kernel patchsets are often ignored by 
most developers apart from the maintainer (ie me in this case.)
Cheers,
Con
