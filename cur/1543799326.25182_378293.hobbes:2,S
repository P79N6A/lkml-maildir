Hi,
Here are 2 patches against your latest 2.6.15-git tree.  They fix the
following problems:
	- bugfix to allow some USB disk enclosure devices to work
	  properly.
	- small workaround to allow suspend to continue, even if the USB
	  driver attached to a device does not have a suspend method
	  (this preserves the old behavior, and is annoying a lot of
	  people.)
thanks,
greg k-h
