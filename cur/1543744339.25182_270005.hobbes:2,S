I'd be curious to understand this better.  i.e. failure mode, why it
fails, for what systems, etc.

What wrote the bootloader to the first disk?  Can *that* write a
unique signature into the disk?  Red Hat's build of parted includes a
patch I wrote (not yet included in parted upstream IIRC) which has
parted write a unique signature to each disk, so that's how we solve
it there...
Thanks,
