Thanks for the terminology clarification. I'll try to clarify the 
hardware scenarios.
Currently, cards that use the I/O port space ought to work, so long as 
their Etherboot drivers are well-behaved. Those that use PIO (like the 
QEMU's NE2K-PCI, which looks like NE2K bolted onto a PCI/ISA bridge) 
ought to work 100%. Those that use I/O ports to set up DMA transfers may 
or may not work depending on whether they try to DMA directly into 
pointers specified by UNDI calls.
I am in the process of implementing a way to pass the virtual address of 
each memory mapped I/O region described in the PCI BARs; once this 
works, the same caveats as for I/O port controlled

This is true. I had to verify that the Etherboot UNDI code performs 
copies to/from its memory (which it knows the precise location of), 
rather than DMAing to pointers.
I think the virtualization approach is workable for stacks that hide 
themselves properly in E820 maps (not specified in the PXE spec), but 
somewhat complicated. It would have to either use a IOMMU (afaik not 
present on Pacifica, VT, or LT), or enforce a 1:1 correspondence between 
the emulated physical pages and actual physical pages that are provided 
to the stack.
The advantage of this over downloading an Etherboot stack is that it 
slightly simplifies deployment -- there is no need to install a 
Etherboot option ROM or boot image on each node. I believe the code 
complexity, development, and testing costs are higher than they are for 
our current approach, where we get to control and fix the firmware.

I agree. The PXE specification is woefully underspecified and clunky for 
protected mode operation. Performance is on the order of broadband speed 
-- I'm getting 200-250KB/s using polling (as opposed to interrupt-driven 
I/O), with QEMU running on a 2GHz Athlon.
We still need drivers in the Etherboot-based strategy -- they live in 
the Etherboot layer. Etherboot drivers would be checked for conformance 
with protected mode operation.
