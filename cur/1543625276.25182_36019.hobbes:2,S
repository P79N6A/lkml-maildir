Thank you for pointing that out. But I'm afraid it doesn't
answer my question. I understand that a system where init
has died cannot be expected to continue working like if
nothing was wrong.
What to do in this case might be a matter of taste, of
course a panic or a reboot does make sense. But trying to
recover as much as posible would also make sense. This
could be caused by a problem in userspace, the kernel does
not have to be corrupted already.
If we agree that this is a matter of taste lets not try to
argue about whose taste is the best.
I was really just wondering if the patch below would work.
Well I just tested it, and it did work like I expected. If
I killed init (by replacing /sbin/init with something else
and telling init to reexecute itself) I got the warning.
But the system continued to work.
Of course init would no longer respawn processes, and I
could not change runlevel. But I could login, kill
processes, and remount filesystems read-only. And no
processes became zombies.
