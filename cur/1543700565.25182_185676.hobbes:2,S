The target option line is quite flexible. It could be used to list the
required crypto features. If only an encryption cipher is selected, it
would be backward compatible with the cryptoloop on-disk format (like it
is now). But when additional options are given IV hashing could be
turned on, another option could turn on block shuffling or something.
I'm currently having a private conversation with the cryptoloop
maintainer. The possibilities in cryptoloop are mainly restricted by the
losetup interface, he would love to have more possibilities. There are a
lot of things that could and should be implemented.

dm-crypt -> loop -> file should work. Just like LVM on top of a file,
I've already done that before.
