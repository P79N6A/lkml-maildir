Right now, there's not really any other way of handling it. The firmware 
may screw with pretty much everything, and it might even be safe for it 
to do so in many cases. In any case, you don't necessarily win that much 
by registering all the opregions, since SMI can go behind your back and 
write to stuff that's not declared in the DSDT anyway.
