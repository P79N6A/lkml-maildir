Yes, I've noticed this.  The fact multiple other people do _not_ consider this 
a joke doesn't seem to have sunk in yet.

The kernel didn't need perl to build until 2.6.25.  For 17 years, this 
dependency was not required.  You added it, in a way that affected even 
"allnoconfig", for no obvious gain.

So rather than debugging it, you rewrote it in perl.  Much less potential 
mysterious behavior there.

Could you please be a little more specific?

This doesn't _need_ bignum support.  It maxes out around 72 bits and the 
_result_ can't use more than about $SHIFT bits because you're dividing by the 
amount you shifted, so just chop off the bottom 32 bits, do a normal 64 bit 
division on the top (it has to fit), and then do the same division on the 
appropriate shifted remainder, and combine the results.  This is easy because 
when the shift _is_ 32 bits or more, the bottom 32 bits all have to be zeroes 
so you don't even have to mask and add, just shift the remainder left 32 bits 
so you can continue the divide.
Pulling out perl isn't always a good alternative to thinking about the 
problem.
