    Folks,
	This group was instrumental in helping me get my first-ever
	linux/PCI-bus device driver working last year, and I'm back for
	some more help if you are willing.
	I have a PCI card that generates an interrupt when it completes
	a DMA transfer to the PCs RAM.
	This works just fine on a Dell 4400 running 2.6.10-1.766_FC3
	When I try to run the driver on a Dell 2300 FC2/2.6.5-1.358smp
	or a Sun W2100Z running FC2/2.6.10-1.14_FC2smp I can see the
	DMA-done bit set in the device, but my interrupt service routine
	never gets called.
	On the Sun, I booted with "noapic" option, and it booted OK,
	but then when my device generated an interrupt, there was a
	kernel message about Disabling IRQ #5 and the system was hung
	solidly.
	I think this has something to do with the different interrupt
	hardware on the more advanced servers compared to my desktop
	Dell 4400, and I somehow need to "enable" the IOAPIC system
	so that my interrupt gets through to my service routine, but I
	don't know how.
	I tried grepping through the kernel/drivers source, and I didn't
	find anything that jumped out at me.
	The Rubini drivers book didn't help in this area either, 
	although it's a wonderful book in other areas.
	I can post source somewhere if it will help.
	I can also post the essential bits from /var/log/messages about
	all the incredibly complicated IOAPIC configuration stuff.
	Thank you for your past help, and thank you in advance for any
	tips you can provide.
