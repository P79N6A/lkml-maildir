Is it not possible that the same kernel package can be installed on systems
which do and don't need this feature?  If so, we don't want to force the
provider of that package to create two packages.
That, plus the chances of the package creator actually knowing about this
option aren't great.
Generally, if it can be done at runtime it is better to do so, no?
