iirc, there aren't any MSRs[*] on the K6-2 where we can read
the current FSB.  I think 350MHz was used as it was probably
the slowest K6-2 to be found at the time.  You can override
it with boot time arguments.
    Dave.
[*] The K6 style powernow was reverse engineered, as there were
no publically available documents explaining it. All we can
do is scale multipliers. No voltage scaling, no FSB decoding.
