The comment was referring to x86-64, but I incorrectly remembered that 
applying to "movq $imm,%reg" as opposed to loading from an absolute 
address.  gas actually has a special opcode (movabs) for the 64-bit 
version of the latter variant, which is only available with %rax and its 
subregisters.
Nevermind, in other words.  It's still true, though, that the immediate 
will always be the last thing in the instruction -- that's a fixture of 
the instruction format.

'r' is wrong for 8-bit variables on i386.  It needs to be 'q'.
