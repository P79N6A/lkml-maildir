What you've done there is fine, Randy, thank you.
But I just got out of bed to take another look, and indeed:
what is it doing in the none_mapped !vma->vm_file case?
passing back an uninitialized vector.
Easy enough to fix, but I'd say Nick's patch has by now exceeded
its embarrassment quota, and should be reverted from Linus' tree
for now: clearly none of us have been paying enough attention,
and other eyes are liable to find further errors lurking in it.
