Yes.  The ll_rw_block stuff is SMP safe only with respect to completion
of IOs.  In other words, you can take device driver interrupts without
the big lock, and ll_rw_block is properly threaded with respect to the
interrupts.
However, the submission of requests in the first place is currently
always made with the big lock.  ll_rw_block itself probably won't 
complain if you don't have it, but the device drivers assume that you
already hold it so you don't want to risk changing that.
