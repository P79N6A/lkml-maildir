This is basically how "cpuunits" in OpenVZ works. It is not limiting a
container in any way, just assigns some relative "units" to it, with sum
of all units across all containers equal to 100% CPU. Thus, if we have
cpuunits 10, 20, and 30 assigned to containers X, Y, and Z, and run some
CPU-intensive tasks in all the containers, X will be given
10/(10+20+30), or 20% of CPU time, Y -- 20/50, i.e. 40%, while Z gets
60%. Now, if Z is not using CPU, X will be given 33% and Y -- 66%. The
scheduler used is based on a per-VE runqueues, is quite fair, and works
fine and fair for, say, uneven case of 3 containers on a 4 CPU box.
OpenVZ also has a "cpulimit" resource, which is, naturally, a hard limit
of CPU usage for a VE. Still, given the fact that cpunits works just
fine, cpulimit is rarely needed -- makes sense only in special scenarios
where you want to see how app is run on a slow box, or in case of some
proprietary software licensed per CPU MHZ, or smth like that.
Looks like this is what you need, right?

Yes, CPU controller is quite different of other resource controllers.
