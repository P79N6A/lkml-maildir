	Well, I think while it is a security issue, it is not serious
enough to make it secret (it is not exploitable by anyone except those
who are able to crash the machine).

	I am sorry for this one - I am not subscribed to linux-xfs.
Next time I will post to linux-xfs first.

	As for ext3, I believe the vast majority of ext3 filesystems
run in data=ordered mode. But yes, the same problem affects all filesystem

	Yes, of course. However, the issue is probably much worse
on XFS, because on XFS it probably affects not only the files being
created/extended, but also the files being rewritten. Most other
filesystems rewrite the files in-place, so when you rewrite the file,
even with data=writeback you get only the mix of the old and new
contents. Not somebody else's random data.
	This particular problem was that one of my users apparently opened
his TeX document just to fix few typos, and ended up with the file which
contained some part of a shell script and some binary data :-(
	I agree this is hard to exploit on purpose, however it can still
leak a sensitive data. For example, this particular server runs also
a mail server for ~2200 users, so a private mail can end up in somebody
else's files.

	OK, thanks! I wish I would have time to do more kernel hacking ...
