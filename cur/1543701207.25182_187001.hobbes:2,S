Yep, I checked all threads. Not all threads have sleeps, but they do use 
semaphores or some blocking OS calls. Are you saying that's not enough? I 
think it should be, else the threads have design flaws.

Yep, IMHO you don't have to set the schedule type in "OTHER" mode.

I like that Idea, it would be really appreciated if you could give me some 
sample code, just to get me started.
Thanks a lot,
