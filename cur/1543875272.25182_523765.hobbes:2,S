I don't see why this is the case to be honest.
You can ask distros to ship your library, and if it's a sensible one,
they will. And if you can't wait, you can always bundle the library with
your application, it's really not a big deal to do that properly.
That's not a reason to make it a harder problem by tying a library to
the kernel source... in fact I know enterprise distros are more likely
to uprev a library than to uprev a kernel.... tying them together you
get the worst of both worlds....
