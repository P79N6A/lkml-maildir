1. "82489DX Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller", Intel order
number 290446.
2. "82489DX User's Manual, AP-388", Intel order number 292116.
However getting these dated 1993 docs from Intel can be a real PITA. 
 APIC_TIMER_BASE_DIV means to use the output of the internal divider (that
is configured by the Divider Configuration Register) as the time base
input for the timer.  This is compatible with the integrated APIC that
newer Pentium and P6 processors include. 
 Other possibilities are as follows:
- APIC_TIMER_BASE_CLKIN, which means to use the APIC clock directly (i.e.
passing by the divider),
- APIC_TIMER_BASE_TMBASE, which means to use the TMBASE input (a separate,
independent pin) which is present on 82489DX APIC chips.
 Additionally, the divider can be configured to use either the APIC clock
or the TMBASE input as its input source.  Using of the APIC clock is
compatible with the integrated APIC.  You can choose TMBASE by setting an
appropriate bit in the DCR, as defined by the APIC_TDR_DIV_TMBASE macro.

 It's actually the reverse -- they are not defined for later APICs
anymore.  The 82489DX is the first APIC implementation, introduced late
1992 for 486-based systems and with early Pentium (i.e. these at 60/66) in
mind.  The reserved bits of integrated APICs which are defined for 82489DX
chips are ignored for compatibility, so there is no problem.

 Hmm, it looks like we have a bug here when there is no APIC at all. 
Ingo, what about the following patch (it's against 2.3.42 but it should
work against 2.3.99, too)? 
 On the other hand if we have a SMP board with a single CPU we always
enable APIC anyway, so there is no problem.

 But why would anyone want to do this?  I believe if someone sets HZ to 0,
the resulting kernel will not work even if compiled for UP...  In other
words one gets what he deserves if messing with the kernel carelessly.

 The two mentioned docs describe the I/O APIC unit of the 82489DX (the
chip includes one local unit and one I/O unit in a single core).
 Newer I/O APICs are documented in the following datasheets:
1. "82093AA I/O Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (IOAPIC)",
Intel order number 290566.
2. "82378ZB System I/O (SIO) and 82379AB System I/O APIC (SIO.A)", Intel
order number 290571.
3. "82374EB/82374SB EISA System Component (ESC)" (I don't have an order
number handy).
Check Intel's developer site -- they used to be available online.
 I think there may also be I/O APIC specs in datasheets for some newer
chipsets targeted to P6 family processors.
