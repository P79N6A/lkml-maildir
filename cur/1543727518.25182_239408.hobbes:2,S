Subject: problems with Mandrake 10.0 + kernel 2.6.8-rc2

Hi,
I've recently moved to Mandrake 10.0 (prompted by a defunct hard disk
which neccesitated a complete re-install) and have had several problems.
As a result I have upgraded my kernel from 2.6.3 to 2.6.7 and then 2.6.8-rc2.
Unfortunately the fire may be hotter than the frying-pan (Old English
Proverb) and I'm now in a state where I can't mount CDroms. I can
read the raw device OK, so the basic driver (ide-cd) is OK, or at least
it seems to be. I've added traces to isofs.ko and established that this
initialises OK, but when I attempt to mount the driver it gets a return
code of -EINVAL when it tries to read the superblock (get_sb_bdev?()).
I'm pretty sure that this must be something set up wrong somewhere as
it's unlikely that 2.6.7 (or 2.6.8) would be released without someone
somewhere needing to mount a cdrom, but I have no idea where to go from
here. I am not a kernel-hacker, though I did some many moons ago, but
I know enough to patch and rebuild modules and test them. I took a look at
the source code of ide-cd.c but can't make much sense of the way things are
done these days, and have too many other things to do....
Can anyone give me advice (or even better a fix)?
I'd appreciate being CC'd on any response as I'm not on the
kernel mailing list (too many others to wade through).
Many thanks,
Bill
