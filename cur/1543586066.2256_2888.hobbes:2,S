This is using KFTP - which system was it compiled on? It may be linked
with static libraries since this appears to be a runtime library error or
configuration error at compile time...
Does it work (same ftp binary, same hardware) with the older kernel?

I think this is the same error.

Not a good test - this only verifys that the system used has large file support
compiled into (assuming static) ftp. This should work on the same system with
the current kernel.
