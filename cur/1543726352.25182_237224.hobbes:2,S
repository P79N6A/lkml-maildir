Could you summarize the differences?  Would you please consider posting
patches against his patches instead of starting over from scratch?
I'd really like to start looking at these patches and figure out how
we'd use them for NFS/rpcsec_gss, but this is made more difficult by
the fact that there are now 2 or 3 different pieces of code floating
around now that all claim to do PAG/keyring stuff.
