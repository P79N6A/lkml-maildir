Just a data point...
I haven't had any prolems what so ever so far at 18 hrs.
I just installed it yesterday on an Athlon XP 3200+ w a nvida 2 chipset
Distribution is Slackware 10.1
I am running W$ XP Pro under VMware 5 & have interminently heavy NFS
traffic.
I compiled 2.6.12.5 w gcc v3.3.4.  Did you by any chance build w gcc v4 ?
Cheers,
