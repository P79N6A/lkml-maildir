woops ... fortunately, I dont have that kind of problem. my code just does:
 loop {
   ioctl( SG_IO - timeout=3 seconds);
   write block to disk.
 }
SG_IO behaves a bit more friendly.... than, say, "CDROMREAD{MODE1,MODE2,AUDIO}" does.
nevertheless, the IDE interface becomes unusable until you reboot the system.
e.g., just right now, I did:
  o insert bad CD
  o read it until an error occurs.
  o "hdparm -w /dev/hdb" - this will turn DMA off. kernel log shows:
        hdb: DMA disabled
        hdb: ATAPI reset complete
  o "hdparm -d 1 /dev/hdb" to reenable DMA, "hdparm /dev/hdb" to look at the
    drive settings. the kernel log then shows:
        hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
        ide: failed opcode was: unknown
        hdb: ATAPI reset complete
        hdb: status error: status=0x49 { DriveReady DataRequest Error }
        hdb: status error: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
        ide: failed opcode was: unknown
        hdb: drive not ready for command
        hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
        hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
        ide: failed opcode was: unknown
        hdb: request sense failure: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
        hdb: request sense failure: error=0x44 { AbortedCommand LastFailedSense=0x04 }
  hdparm is now in state "D" -> reboot required.
  not so good, da?
kind regards,
herbert rosmanith
