Heck, I had a very hard lock-up with that one here after two hours of
proper operation, I cannot currently tell what it was from or if it
even was DC-390's fault. Need to research further. 
However, at least it booted properly with DC-390 2.0d14 linked against
the kernel and a streamer at #3 and a scanner at #5 and worked for a
while.
