I also think this is OK.
The comment above lock_task_sighand() is not very clear. Note that it is
_not_ safe in general to do
	read_lock(tasklist_lock);
	lock_task_sighand(tsk);
even if we know that tsk can't go away (say, get_task_struct()).
However, it is safe to do:
	read_lock(tasklist_lock);
	tsk = find_task_in_pids_database();
	lock_task_sighand(tsk);
"find_task_in_pids_database" means something like find_task_by_pid_type() or
do_each_pid_task() (our case). Because read_lock(tasklist_lock) protects us
from release_task()->__exit_signal() which clears ->sighand _and_ removes tsk
from kernel/pid.c:pid_hash[] "atomically" under write_lock_irq(tasklist_lock).
rcu_read_lock() is OK for both cases. It would be nice to convert send_sigio()
to use RCU, but we also need tasklist_lock for
	- SIGCONT, see sig_needs_tasklist()
	- group wide signals (PIDTYPE_PGID), see the comment in copy_process()
	  above the recalc_sigpending() call.
Oleg.
