Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] earlier printk output
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/11/27/277

This patch creates console devices specifically for use during early
boot, and registers them so that printk() output may be seen prior
to console_init().
The patch is available from:
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/wli/early_printk/
Included are i386 config options, early VGA text output, and early i386
serial output.
Cheers,
Bill
