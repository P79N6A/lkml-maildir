Hi,
I have been going through the containers code and trying it out. I tried
mounting the same hierarchy at two different points and I got a bad
locking balance warning.
=====================================
[ BUG: bad unlock balance detected! ]
-------------------------------------
mount/4467 is trying to release lock (&type->s_umount_key) at:
[<c017de3b>] vfs_kern_mount+0x5b/0x70
but there are no more locks to release!
other info that might help us debug this:
no locks held by mount/4467.

 =======================
Going through the code, I realised this is because when the container is
already mounted at one point, when being remounted, it just does a
simple_set_mnt which does not update s_umount which causes the warning
to come. This also cause umount to hang the second time.
The correct method would be allocate the superblock using sget (or a
variant) which would call grab_super correctly and set these locks.
Seeing the code which is there, some part of grab_super is already done
in container_get_sb where the root->sb->s_active is updated. So I have
called down_write there as well to get the locking balance. However I
believe that this is not the correct approach.
There are a few questions I had with respect to the current code,
Why is the increment of s_active dependent on the return value of
simple_set_mnt? All the other functions which I have seen (fs ones),
grab_super (which increments s_active) is called followed by a
simple_set_mnt.
What should be the correct approach to get the locking balance? As far
as I can see, the correct method would be to call sget which would then
correctly handle everything. But that would require a test function. I
saw functionality similar to a test function in the beginning of
container_get_sb(). Should that be seperated and put in a seperate test
function so that sget can be called?
Another possible approach would be to call grab_super directly (since we
know the test function is going to return true), but this cannot be done
since grab_super is static right now. Or maybe we could duplicate
grab_super's functionality.
In the meantime a temporary fix.
Thanks and regards
Dhaval
