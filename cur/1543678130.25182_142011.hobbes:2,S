Dear developers,
I am a student working in a realtime systems project at the Technical 
University of
Munich. In the time being i have to be able to write a certain data of 
one sector on
a certain CHS (actually LBA) on the hard disk. I am trying to do it with 
inserting and
removing a module which i write in C.
Please send your comments or reference codes regarding to the info given 
below.
Kindly regards.
