The cpu speed is detected by comparing the TSC against the
PIT.  The PIT is used to drive the clock.  If it is wrong by
this much you should see time drifting like mad.  If the TSC
is wrong, you should see errors in the sub 1/HZ correction
applied to get_time_of_day().  You could detect this by
looping on a get_time_of_day() call and noticing that time
slides ahead 3/HZ seconds and then back each tick.  What
would be happening is that the interpolation code would be
taking the fast TSC (i.e. 500MHZ when it thought it was 165)
and be pushing time out beyond the next tick value.  Each
tick this would reset and be replayed.  If neither of these
is happening, the reported value is most likely what is
really going on.
