_My_ home box is idle; it performs equally well with any scheduler, or with _no_ scheduler. _I_ needed the feature in order to try my hand at kernel hacking.
Others may need it if they have symmetric per-cpu threads and they wish to maximize throughput (possibly at the expense of latency). By binding a cpu to a thread, cpu switching overhead for that thread is avoided. An obvious example is distributed.net's crackers -- latency is not an issue; throughput is.

Since the machine is doing no useful work other than compiling the kernel, I doubt I'd notice the difference. But I will take a look.
