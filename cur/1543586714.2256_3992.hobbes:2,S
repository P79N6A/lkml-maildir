That sure is a very bad hack :) (For the original poster: search for
get_wchan in the various ports)
There is no comment anywhere near it that says what it is MEANT to do. You
can guess from the code and the usage that it has to do with stack-frames
and special-casing the scheduler functions..  Thanks for the 
clarification.. now I can go and fix it in arch/cris :) (I had never seen
the WCHAN field in ps before actually)
Just as a reference (everyone should get their daily dose of headache)
here is the i386 version:
unsigned long get_wchan(struct task_struct *p)
{
        unsigned long ebp, esp, eip;
        unsigned long stack_page;
        int count = 0;
        if (!p || p == current || p->state == TASK_RUNNING)
                return 0;
        stack_page = (unsigned long)p;
        esp = p->thread.esp;
        if (!stack_page || esp < stack_page || esp > 8188+stack_page)
                return 0;
        /* include/asm-i386/system.h:switch_to() pushes ebp last. */
        ebp = *(unsigned long *) esp;
        do {
                if (ebp < stack_page || ebp > 8184+stack_page)
                        return 0;
                eip = *(unsigned long *) (ebp+4);
                if (eip < first_sched || eip >= last_sched)
                        return eip;
                ebp = *(unsigned long *) ebp;
        } while (count++ < 16);
        return 0;
}
