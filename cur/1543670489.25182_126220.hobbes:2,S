Sometimes disks just go bang. They seem to do it distressingly more
often nowdays which (while handy for criminals and pirates) is annoying
for the rest of us. Putting magic in the file system to handle this is
hard to do well, and at best you get things like ext2/ext3 have now -
the ability to recover data in the event of some corruption, unless you
get into really fancy stff.
Buy IDE disks in pairs use md1, and remember to continually send the
hosed ones back to the vendor/shop (and if they keep appearing DOA to
your local trading standards/fair trading type bodies).
Perhaps someone should also start a scoreboard for people to report dead
IDE drives by vendor ;)
