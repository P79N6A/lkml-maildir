With
struct epoll_event {
        __u32 events;
        __u64 data;
};
this won't work on s390. offsetof(struct epoll_event, data) is 8 on both
31 bit and 64 bit. So it will do the conversion and corrupt all the data.
Actually we would only need the compat conversion for the sigset_t stuff.
But then again I thought most 32 bit architectures would add a 4 byte
pad between events and data, no?
Maybe we need some arch dependent struct compat_epoll_event and have
something like
#define EPOLL_NEED_EVENT_COMPAT() \
(offsetof(struct epoll_event, data) != offsetof(struct compat_epoll_event, data))
?
