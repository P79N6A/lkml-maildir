Cornelia,
in the patch is:
  +	if (dev->kobj.parent == &dev->class->subsys.kobj)
  +		return 0;
which will skip the creation of the "device"-link, right?
But still, I don't think the transaction-style of error handling is
what we want, it's for some critical subsystems the equivalent of
adding PANIC(), and this just for a failing symlink-creation. I think
we just want to print the to the logs, and not let the whole core
device registration fail entirely.
Thanks,
Kay
