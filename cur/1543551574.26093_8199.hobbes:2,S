Yeah.
It's "easier".
Until you want to actually _map_ the thing.
At which point it turns a hell of a lot harder.
In short, it's a classic case of being STUPID. Taking something that looks
easy, and staying with the wrong approach long after it turns out that the
"easy" case wasn't the easy one after all.
