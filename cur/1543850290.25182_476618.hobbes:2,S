It attempts to change NMI_DEFAULT to NMI_LOCAL_APIC for recent BIOS
versions, even when the user does _not_ specify nmi_watchdog= on the
command line.  However a few lines further down is this test which
fails because nmi_active is 0.
	if (!atomic_read(&nmi_active))
		return 0;
The calling sequence is setup_local_APIC() -> setup_apic_nmi_watchdog()
-> atomic_inc(nmi_active), but only if nmi_watchdog contains
NMI_LOCAL_APIC or NMI_IO_APIC.  Without a command line option,
setup_apic_nmi_watchdog() does nothing, nmi_active is still 0 and
check_nmi_watchdog() exits early.  Only if you specify nmi_watchdog= on
the command line so nmi_active is non-zero before check_nmi_watchdog()
is called do you get an NMI handler.  IOW, the automatic activation of
the NMI handler is too late.
