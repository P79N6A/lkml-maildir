I haven't, and in fact keep a 2.2.14 kernel available (and in my lilo config)
just so I can use the linmodem binary.  It's a pain having to reboot when I want
to use the modem, but it's the only solution I've found.

Does anyone have any success in using Lucent winmodem under Linux 2.4.0?
There's a binary at 
http://www.linmodems.org/linux568.zip
 but it
only works under 2.2
Thanks,
Jeff
