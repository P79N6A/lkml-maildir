It sounds very much like an ioctl() operation to me.  Basically, fcntl()
operations usually operate not on the file, but on the file descriptor.
They affect such things as close-on-exec, async IO status and so on.
Anything which affects the inode should probably be an ioctl().

Definitely ioctl() material.  Extending fcntl() would be appropriate for
advanced file-descriptor-specific operations such as defining readahead
properties for the fd, but what you've listed here sounds as if the
existing ioctl pass-through would be both appropriate and sufficient.
Cheers,
 Stephen
