I did, but no predictability tests, only FIPS 140-2 or so. It checked
out pretty well but someone claimed that the RNG was predictable because
it was probably only used for some of the coding for wireless. I don't
know how to test this hypothesis as I don't know enough about QAM and
whatever codings are used there (nor do I know where you'd need
(pseudo-)random numbers)
