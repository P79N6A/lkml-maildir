I can give this patch a reviewed-by: too, and I will also try to review a couple
of the pending ipoib patches.

The new QoS fields fall into fields that are currently reserved, which should be
ignored by an older SM.  I've only tested this against openSM however.

This patch was generated in response to an Intel MPI issue.  We've seen MPI take
several minutes to respond to a connection request during the middle of large
application runs.  When this happens, the active side times out the connection.
In OFED, we added module parameters to adjust the rdma_cm connection timeout on
the active side, but I believe that sending an MRA from the passive side is a
better solution.
