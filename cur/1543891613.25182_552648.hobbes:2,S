And if we have a new syscall we don't need any of that special dup2
behavior you describe.  I really don't think this should be added.  dup2
should just do what POSIX specifies, nothing more.  I would even suggest
to not allow to dup2() to a descriptor > RLIMIT_NOFILE unless it is
already allocated.  I.e., don't allow creating arbitrary high descriptors.
This behavior is completely consistent with the current implementation.
 No bad surprises.  In fact, it eliminates parts of the ABI
incompatibility I talked about.

It's not an added security issue.  It would mean removing a possible
security the current file descriptor allocation has.
If randomizing each allocator is too expensive then randomize at the
very least the number of the first descriptor you give out.

There is no requirement to duplicate everything since non-sequential
descriptors are a new feature.  Existing program will not be affected.
As said above, I think it is better if dup2() to a high descriptor which
does not exist is not allowed.  You have to be able to dup2() over an
existing one but that's it.
For F_DUPFD I also don't see justification for an extension to
non-sequential descriptors.  The concept of "greater than" makes not
much sense for non-sequential descriptors.  I think I would be more than
happy to restrict the specified lower bound to RLIMIT_NOFILE as it is now.
If latter this turns out to be a big limitation we can still extend the
dup2/fcntl functionality.  But removing functionality is harder.
