i believe you are confusing '2000 threads created and happily waiting
blocked to do something' and the '2000 threads running' case. I
specifically included a quick benchmark showing 20 thousand threads being
around on my system and not impacting Linux scheduler performance the
slightest. What i say is that more than nr_cpus*2 _running_ (ie. currently
waiting for the CPU, not some other resource) threads are bad.
