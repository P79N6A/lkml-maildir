Issue 1: magic key + h noise
I have determined that LILO on the remote box is feeding noise back to the
other machine while it's booted. When I commented the serial port in
inittab and init q'd. Shut the other machine down and brought it up. I saw
no such noise spewed out.
This is not a kernel issue.
As for the keyboard sticky issue other users are reporting this as well.
