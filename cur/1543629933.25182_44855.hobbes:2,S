here is kbuild-2.5-sparc64-2.5.14-2.  you still need to apply the hacks
patch before using this from
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/kbuild/linux-2.5.14-sparc64-hacks.patch.bz2.
  This won't be necessary once 2.5.15 comes out as Dave has already sent these fixes to Linus. 
  Changes from kbuild-2.5-sparc64-2.5.14-1 
    Build against core-12 
    Builds with kbuild 2.4 now as well
    asm-offsets.c now uses the new thread_info offsets 
    Had to use the CFLAG ugliness of ia64 to get asm-offsets.c to
    work properly as include/asm-sparc64/system.h uses thread_info 
    offsets.
