It's not trivial to write something like this :)
I'll be using something I already have.  If I can't reproduce the problem,
then perhaps it is due to sendfile and someone can write a customized
test.  The main reason I offered is because people are ignoring the
bug report for the most part and asking for a test case.  I may be able
to offer an independent verification of the problem which might convince
someone to write up a dedicated test case...
