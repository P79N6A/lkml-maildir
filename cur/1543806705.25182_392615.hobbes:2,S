The point is not only getting access to the source code, but also being 
able to change it. Being able to freely study the code is only half of 
the beauty of the GPL. The other half, being able to change it, can be 
very effectively stopped using DRM.
I agree with your position that the GPL should not be used to prevent 
implementing a DRM system, but I like the fact that it's trying to 
prevent DRM:ing the code itself (e.g. requiring signed binaries to run).
The effect would probably be that no one can implement a DRM system that 
isn't easily broken, but that only demonstrates how flawed the idea of 
DRM is.
