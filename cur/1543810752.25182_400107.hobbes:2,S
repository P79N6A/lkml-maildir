I agree that is is a _good_ thing that us kernel developers can do this,
and that it isn't impossible (I do the same thing.)  But we also aren't
worrying about the fact that our sound stopped working, or that the
desktop icons don't show up anymore if we plug in a new device.  We are
a very special case.
For any "user", they should not ever count on using a different kernel
than what was shipped with the system (or updates) for an "enterprise"
distro.  There are just too many little things that easily go wrong.

We are trying, but as everyone is so quick to point out, we (myself
included) mess up at times :)
