That's true. But currently, each useless workqueue thread is consuming a
task_struct in memory, so this patch makes actually consuming less memory than
before.
If the system is running low on memory...well perhaps I can reschedule the thread
creation after some delays...?

I did it with kpsmoused but there are so much workqueues:
$ git-grep create_singlethread_workqueue | wc -l
122
And lot of them are related to particular drivers for hardware I don't have.
So it wouldn't be easy for me to test and fix them.
And note that this patch only solves a part of the problem. It breaks the useless
threads creation, not the useless workqueue creation. So there is still some useless
memory used, and this problem can only be solved one by one.
