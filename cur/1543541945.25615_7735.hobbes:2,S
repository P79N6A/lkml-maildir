This check doesn't work.
Example: assume val.totalram = val.totalswap = val.totalhigh = 2.5 GB
Then mem_total = 7.5 GB mod 4 GB = 3.5 GB
and 3.5 GB > 2.5 GB.
qed.
(More detail: for a sum of n terms, it breaks (for example) for equal  
terms between max/(n-1) as lower and 2*max/n as upper bound. For n=2, this  
is empty; for n=3, it's between 1/2*max and 2/3*max, for n=4 it'd be  
between 1/3*max and 1/2*max, and so on.)
