Yes, it is indeed a separate mount in both cases, but in the broken case,
/proc/fs/nfsd is empty.
The patch in question introduces a proc ->d_revalidate method which does
this:
static int proc_revalidate_dentry(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)
{
	d_drop(dentry);
	return 0;
}
I'm not sure why it drops the dentry and then returns OK to the VFS; is it
to force the VFS to revalidate the dentry?  In that case, I think it should
return -ESTALE.  I also don't know why /proc needs a ->d_revalidate in the
first place (it was fine up until now).  Perhaps what proc does now is
correct, but its behavior has changed such that nfsd's /proc/fs/nfsd needs
to do something different (like grab an extra dentry ref?).
Anyway, if I comment out the d_drop line in proc_revalidate_dentry, or
remove proc's ->d_revalidate method, nfs exporting works again.
Someone more familiar with this patch and /proc should investigate.  Until
then, nfsv2/3 exporting are broken in 2.6.24-rc4.
