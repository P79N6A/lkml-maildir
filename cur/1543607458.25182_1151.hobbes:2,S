The most precise tool known to mankind is cyclesoak :)
It's at 
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/#zc
 and there's
a README in the tarball.
cyclesoak measures subtractively - rather than measuring the
load of your software, it measures how much other system
load slows it down.  For networking it gives results which
are repeatable down to about 0.2% of system capacity.  So
you should run a known workload both with and without your
netfilter code and record the difference in cyclesoak output.
Currently it tries to lump memory bandwidth load and CPU cycle
load into a single metric, which doesn't work very well - these
things are orthogonal and should be reported separately.  That's
on my TTD list.
