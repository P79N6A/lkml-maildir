Busybox "mount" maintainer's ears perk up to see if this is relevant.  (After 
all, we have a separate implementation you can try to see if it's a tool 
bug.)
But no, this one's clearly a kernel error.  If the kernel is giving write 
errors against the device afterwards, than the kernel's internal state 
toggled successfully, which is all the mount syscall was trying to do.  Mount 
is just reporting whether or not the syscall succeeded, not whether or not it 
should have. :)
