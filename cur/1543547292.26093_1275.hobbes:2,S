I agree that the MTBF can be very misleading...
But put it this way:  My server ran 2.2.14 for over 400 days before I
rebooted it.  It was down for about 5 minutes while rebooting (probably
less).
My NT Server gets a nightly reboot.  I can't get it to run for more than a
week without it developing _some_ problem.
Mind you, on both of these systems, nobody is doing any development/kernel
hacking/anything.  They're just mail/www/ftp/dns/login (for linux) servers.
To a first order approximation, they're basically the same hardware, both
protected by a UPS.
