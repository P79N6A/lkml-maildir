Subject: [PATCH][KBUILD] Fix filechk_gen-asm-offsets

Sam,
It looks like kbuild was recently broken by the filechk changes.
At least on Alpha, filechk_gen-asm-offsets is getting nothing but
stdin... Not very useful ;-). All platforms but x86 look broken too.
The enclosed patchlet fixes my compilation problems.
Thanks,
        M.

Places change, faces change. Life is so very strange.
