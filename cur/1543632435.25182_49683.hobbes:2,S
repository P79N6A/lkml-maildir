Hello,
	I wanted to know if it is possible to have a very big system V shared 
memory segment (say about 1Gb) ?
	I've quickly looked into the source code of shm.c and shm.h in ipc/ and 
I've read the following:
/*
  * SHMMAX, SHMMNI and SHMALL are upper limits are defaults which can
  * be increased by sysctl
  */
But how far is it possible to increase them ? And which sysctl must be 
done ?
Thank you for answering,
--
