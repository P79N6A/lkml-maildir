There are many locations in the kernel that due this (and similar things).
A list was generated by someone a while back. It can be found at
http://suberic.net/~kevin/linuxbugs.txt
I don't know what kernel the list was compiled against, and some of these
may have moved, or been fixed by now.
But as it's already been said, for a lot of these incidents, there is often
no 'nice way out' when things fail. Trapping all these cases to panic and
explain why would probably be not worth the space that they would take up,
as they really are 99.9% impossible to hit. (Or at least should be).
regards,
Dave.
