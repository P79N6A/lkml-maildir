This is a problem for speedtouch users too - I get regular reports from users
that their modem failed to find the firmware, usually because it wasn't in the
initrd.

I don't understand what you're saying here - what kind of situation are
you thinking of when you talk about "update your driver for a quick hardware
change"?

You're creating a new kernel API here, so it needs to be good from the
word go: "for the moment at least" could easily become "needs to be
supported forever".  It's a pity if the scheme can't handle even mildly
complicated situations.

There's no reason to think that Thomson is dead set against having
distributions distribute firmware.  I bet the problem is simply that
no distribution has yet tried to sort the licensing problem out.
Maybe one day distributions will ship with speedtouch firmware.  If
so, it would be sad to then discover that the kernel+tools are too
unsophisticated to handle the situation.

Putting in infrastructure that is adequate for most drivers but not all,
will simply make it much harder to move one day to an infrastructure that
can handle the requirements of all drivers, because most people won't be
motivated.
As I remarked in another email, MODULE_FIRMWARE could be made to work
with the speedtouch driver as long as it is possible to specify patterns,
or at least initial parts of filenames.
Ciao,
Duncan.
