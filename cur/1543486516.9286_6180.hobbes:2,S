In order to kill it, you have to find it :-).  And you won't with ps. 
There's a race between ps and the process which the process almost always
wins. So it's hidden.  The way you notice this kind of process is that the
load is 1, and top shows no processes using cpu.  Then you know something
fishy is going on.  You disable some CPUs, schedule your shell as
real-time, and only _then_ can you do a ps to find the offending user.
