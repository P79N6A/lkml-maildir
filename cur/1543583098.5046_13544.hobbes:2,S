Hmm.. are there different nvram.c drivers? I noticed that SuSE 7.1 
loads that driver in i386....
Also doesn't look a lot like Atari:
 * This driver allows you to access the contents of the non-volatile 
memory in
 * the mc146818rtc.h real-time clock. This chip is built into all PCs 
and into
 * many Atari machines. In the former it's called "CMOS-RAM", in the 
latter
 * "NVRAM" (NV stands for non-volatile).
