I am well aware of the problems of allocating more memory in some of
these places - been the bane of my life for the last couple of years
with XFS ;-)
It just feels so bad to have the ability to build a large request and
use one bio structure and know that 99.9% of the time the lower layers
can handle it in one chunk, but instead have to chop it into the lowest
common denominator pieces for the sake of the other 0.1%.
Just looking at how my disks ended up partitioned not many of them are
even on 4K boundaries, so any sort of concat built on them would
have a boundary case which required such a split - I think, still
working on my caffine intake this morning.
