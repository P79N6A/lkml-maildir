Nope. VFAT is using short name as long as it complies with MSDOS; this name
is stored in codepage character set.

You actually need both; utf8 just says it is OK not to try to mangle names;
it does not substitute iocharset option.

tell this to Microsoft. It is how VFAT works. Although umlaut should
probably be considered as MSDOS-safe, at least with proper codepage option.

mount shortname=mixed is probably what you want.

The filesystem is foobared already because it contains both capital and
lowercase versions of the same names. This is what happens when you try to
use wrong codepage.
