Hopefully, but I'm not holding out that much hope for the subvendor
stuff to be correctly initialised.
At least now we have a way to find out - as of last night, Linus' 
kernel will now displaying the subvendor and subdevice information
while it probes the hardware, and it has the tweaks to IRQMUX and
the the other PCI only IRQ hack disabled.  This, along with the
PNP fix from Adam should solve all the IRQ problems people have
been recently seeing.
Those which remain should be the result of missing or incorrect setup
of the multi-function pins on the cardbus bridge, and I'm hoping to
receive reports from people with cardbus sockets needing some kind of
fixing up - and these should come with the subvendor/device information
readily available. 8)
