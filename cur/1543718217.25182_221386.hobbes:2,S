From Olaf Kirch
 -      single application on NFS client opens file and maps it.
        No-one else has this file open. File contains "zappa\n",
        and the test app stats it once a second and reports size and
        contents.
        len=6, data=7a 61 70 70 61 0a
 -      on the NFS server, I do "echo frobnorz > file"
 -      after a while, the test app on the client reports
        len=10, data=7a 61 70 70 61 0a
 -      I ctrl-C the app and restart it. We agree that this amounts to
        a munmap+mmap of the file, right?
        The test app now reports
        len=10, data=7a 61 70 70 61 0a 00 00 00 00
my fix is untested at this time (but I expect it to fix the above
problem).

I already intentionally broke that invariant in 2.4 just to make exactly
this thing work safely, this is needed for correct O_DIRECT semantics
too.
All it matters is that the pages are re-read after munmap+mmap.

It didn't break anything in 2.4 AFIK.
