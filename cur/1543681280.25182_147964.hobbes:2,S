With the previous SCHED_ISO, moving big windows was smooth for a short time,
but then it became jerky.  Unlike with stock where it was smooth all the time.

This is also true for stock.

OK, the latest SCHED_ISO fixed my problem, but now I am afraid of the scheduler
trying to be too intelligent, because if it makes the wrong choice the bad result
will be much more noticeable.
I like the simplicity of stock, the interactivity bonus is given in a simple and
understandable way, and if it's not given to the process you want, you can always
renice it or make it RT.
I have to admit that
p->sleep_avg = MIN_SLEEP_AVG * (MAX_BONUS - INTERACTIVE_DELTA - 1) / MAX_BONUS;
and
if ((runtime - MIN_SLEEP_AVG < MAX_SLEEP_AVG) && (runtime * JUST_INTERACTIVE > p->sleep_avg))
	p->sleep_avg += (runtime * JUST_INTERACTIVE - p->sleep_avg) *
	                (MAX_SLEEP_AVG + MIN_SLEEP_AVG - runtime) / MAX_SLEEP_AVG;
are quite obscure to me.
Also, I don't understand your MAX_BONUS definition:
((MAX_USER_PRIO - MAX_RT_PRIO) * PRIO_BONUS_RATIO / 100) it evaluates to -15
I would use ((MAX_PRIO - MAX_RT_PRIO) * PRIO_BONUS_RATIO / 100 / 2) since it gives 5.
