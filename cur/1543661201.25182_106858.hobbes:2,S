Well, do "perl -v" and see if it's at least 5.004 (5.004.003 I think
would be better.)  If so, hpa's requirement that everything work on
5.004 is fine.  (And really, I don't believe that requirement is going
to be hard to follow, except that it does constrain the modules in use a
little bit - I'm pretty sure the Digest::MD5 was missing from the 5.004
default set of modules.)

If you hacked sirc...  Well, that's an example of incredibly bad Perl,
so, you should be able to follow well-written and documented Perl, imo.
(I did an amazing amount of sirc hacking in my time, and it was an
exercise in pain, to be honest.)
