Subject: run-away __cli() function call in do_rw_disk()?

I did some interrupt latency tests for linux-2.2.12, and notice an
unusal
__cli() in do_rw_disk().  See part of the related results below.
Function do_rw_disk() calls __cli() and disables interrupts.  It never
enables it again within the function.  As the results show, interrupts
were opened later in various places.
Interrupts were typically blocked for around 150 us on a PentinumII 266 
machine, which is quite long, especially for slower and/or embedded
systems.
I am really not an expert on IDE driver.  Can someone confirm if this
is a bug or not?  In either case, is there a fix to shorten the
interrupt
blocking time?
The file is drivers/block/ide-disk.c.  Line is 390.  
Verified that the code is still there in 2.3.35.
Thanks.

(It starts in do_rw_disk(), and ends in schedule(). The likely situation
is
 that do_rw_disk() is called in a bottom half which executes at the
 beginning of schedule().  This looks like a run-away cli() bug to me.)
