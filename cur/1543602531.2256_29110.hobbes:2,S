In "Character Devices" when configuring the kernel using xconfig there are
double entries for video cards under Direct Rendering Manager.  The
following cards are reported twice:
3dfx Banshee/Voodoo3+
3dlabs GMX 2000
ATI Rage 128
ATI Radeon
Intel I810
Matrox G200/G400/G450
They menu is correct when doing menuconfig. They are only reported once.
The bug is repeatable.
kernel: 2.4.9 patched with 2.4.9-ac15.
gcc: 3.0.2 (snapshot)
