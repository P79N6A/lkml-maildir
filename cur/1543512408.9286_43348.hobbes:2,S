Why thinking about rare machines with 800 USB devices? The way described
above is only for the (short?) time we do not have devfs. Users with more
than 500 devices should wait for kernel 2.5 with devfs! The future linux
should not work with major/minors (for usb and other hotpluggable devs) it
should use something like devfs.
