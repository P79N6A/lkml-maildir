On second thought, if we do this, we would be using the "next" field in
an undocumented way. It is currently documented as follows:
 * @next: at completion submit this descriptor
But that's not how we're going to use it when doing slave transfers:
We're using it to keep track of all the descriptors that have already
been submitted.
I think it would actually be better to go the other way and have the
async_tx API extend the descriptor as well for its private fields. That
way, we get the pointer we need, but we can document it differently.
So how about we do something along the lines of the patch below? We
need to update all the users too of course, but apart from making the
dma_slave_descriptor struct smaller, I don't think it will change the
actual memory layout at all.
