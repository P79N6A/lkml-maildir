I'm not completely against a minimal DIO implementation for the block
device, but right now we get block device QA for free when we test the
rest of the DIO code.  Splitting the code base makes DIO (already a
special case) that much harder to test.
It's obvious there's a lot less code in your patch than fs/direct-io.c,
but I'm still interested in which part of the fs/direct-io.c path is
taking the most time.  I would guess it is allocating the dio?
I don't think we should cut out fs/direct-io.c until we understand
exactly where the hit is coming from.  I know you've done lots of
instrumentation already, but can you share some percentages on the hot
paths?
