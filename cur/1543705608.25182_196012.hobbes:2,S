Hi Lukasz,
I wonder if this SCSI errors might have anything to do with your problem.
I'm reluctant to revert riel's patch because it does not seem to be the
cause for such problems --- it is pretty straighforward and no one can see
why it would corrupt the inode list (as per dwmw2's investigation).
When/how often do this SCSI errors messages happen ? When you saw the
lockup, which driver were you using? (Justin's latest or 2.4.25 vanilla
aic7xxx).
Justin, can you take a look at this log and enlight me, please? Lukasz
says with your newer driver, this does not happen.
