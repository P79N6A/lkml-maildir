The ondemand governor seems to be singled out not because it has unique 
problems, but because it seems to be used by Fedora Core for some strange 
reason.
I would judge that any bugs in cpufreq_ondemand.c are likely equally 
evident in cpufreq_conservative.c, for example. I think the two have the 
same background, and seem to have the same broken locking.

See above. I seriously doubt this is ondemand-specific. The whole cpufreq 
locking seems to be very screwed up.
The current -git tree will complain about some of the more obvious 
problems. If you see a "Lukewarm IQ" message, it's a sign of somebody 
re-taking a cpu lock that is already held.
