I would like to see the following patch added to -mm:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111326617622941&w=2
(I'm guessing that Nathan Scott will need to resubmit it with proper
changelog information.)
The patch fixes a problem where compiling XFS into the kernel (as
opposed to a module) causes swsusp resumes to be waaay slower than they
should be.
It's been tested and found to work by Pavel Machek:

as well as myself:

and I've been running with it for the last couple of weeks now with no
problems.
