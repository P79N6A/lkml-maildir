Try man daemon.
The way I use to do it was simply do a double fork. That is
(simplified)...
if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
	perror("fork");
} else if (!pid) {
	/* child */
	if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
		perror("child fork");
		exit(-1);
	} if (pid) {
		/* child parent */
		/* Here we detach from the child */
		exit(0);
	}
	/* Now this code is a child running almost as a daemon
		with init as the parent. */
	setsid();
	/* Now the child is completely detached from the original
	   parent */
	/* ... daemon code here ... */
	exit(0);
}
/* parent code here */
