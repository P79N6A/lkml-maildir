For sure there are some ways. One dirty way would be to add an static
lock at xc3028 driver. You can rise the lock when firmware is being
uploaded, removing it at the end. This would prevent the troubles you've
mentioned.
A cleaner way would be to create a tasklet for firmware upload. This
will also prevent the driver for a long load time, due to firmware
initialization (a similar change were recently added at ivtv driver).
For sure there are other ways of doing this.
Cheers,
Mauro
