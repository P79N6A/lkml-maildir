What is so bad with it? Note it's a debugging facility and used 
for kcrash kernels where the video output doesn't work. But they
normally only run a few minutes to dump the previous state to disk
and then reboot.

Well I suspect it will not work anymore after Stephen's patch
(or rather try to blink redundantly after panic which is quite dumb) 
If that is your aim then it might be cleaner to remove it.
But then I don't think it hurts anybody.  It's main problem
is that it won't blink for people with USB keyboard.
