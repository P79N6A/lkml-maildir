	My apologies for not having read the inotify thread, I'll go
look in the morning.
	In ->drop_inode(), OCFS2 takes care of noticing that nlink has
been changed by a remote node.  This is necessary for
generic_drop...delete operation to proceed.
	If OCFS2 had to go back to the 2.4 method of checking i_count==1
in ->put_inode(), I'm not sure we're allowed to modify i_nlink there
unlocked, are we?
	I also think we had some sort of race with inode_lock that
->drop_inode() avoids, but I'm not sure.  Mark?
