OK, good.  I thought you meant drop binding to user, rather then reduce
the accounting.

I just mean in general the only time it's valid to drop the binding
(which includes dropping refcount on the user struct) should be when
the object is destroyed.

Heh, yeah in a place like hugetlb_put_quota?

It's so tempting because of the similarity (and hence ease of
administration) with mlocked pages.  And if they can be merged,
user_struct being a fine placeholder, then it's perhaps simpler.
