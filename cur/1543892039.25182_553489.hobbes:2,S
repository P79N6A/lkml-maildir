A better description would be:
"Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and memory mapped in the 1GB
to 4GB address range."

That one would be better as:
"Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and ram mapped in the address
range above 4GB."

In the past a number of machines couldn't remap memory, so you simply
lost any that was covered by the PCI address space.  In that case 4GB
ram mean you got 3GB or 3.5GB ram, and turning on HIGHMEM64G wouldn't
help.
In your case with some ram mapped above 4GB, you want the option that
supports up to 64GB ram (the limit of PAE) which is the
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G.  After all since some ram is mapped between 4 and
5GB, it is as if you had 5GB ram, but the part between 3 and 4GB was
covered up.  You are just lucky enough that the covered up part got
moved out of the way instead so you get to use it.
