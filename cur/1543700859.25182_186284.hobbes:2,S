I tried your script on ext2 and ext3 filesystem on a ramdisk. I got errors,
too. It seems that this problem is unrelated to device driver or
hardware.
The mozilla tarball is too big for a ramdisk. I use a
zhcon-0.2.1.tar.gz (4,991,350 bytes) instead.
I only got one kind of error on ext2 filesystem. That is, the script
 said the read-only directory zhcon-0.2.1 is missing, but it _is_ there.
I used e2fsck to check the ramdisk and found no error.
I got other errors on ext3 filesystem include:
1. missing file
2. corrupted file
but when I used fsck.ext3 to check the ramdisk, the result was clean.
My system is:
CPU:  AMD Athlon XP 1800+
RAM:  256M DDR333
Chipset: VIA KT400A
Linux Distribution: Fedora Core 1
Linux Kernel: kernel-2.4.22-1.2115.nptl.athlon.rpm
