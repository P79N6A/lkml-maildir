With ATA drives, this is strictly a userspace "policy" decision.
Most of us want longer lifespan and 2X the performance from our hardware,
and use UPSs to guarantee continuous power & survivability.
Others want to live more dangerously on the power supply end,
but still be safe on the filesystem end -- no guarantees there,
even with "hdparm -W0" to disable the on-drive cache.
Pulling power from a writing drive is ALWAYS a bad idea,
and can permanently corrupt the track/cylinder that was being
written.  This will toast a filesystem regardless of how careful
or proper the write flushes were done.
Write caching on the drive is not as big an issue as
good reliable power for this.
Cheers
