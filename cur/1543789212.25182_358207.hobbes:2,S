The 6i and 7 series of cards seem to have quite a bit better relative 
speeds. Certainly the 4Lx cards can be outperformed in simple "hdparm" 
tests by a 3ware SATA controller/disks of half the price..
Plus, software RAID can't provide good performance on many server/DB 
applications without risking data loss in certain cases - for such 
things one really wants something with a battery-backed cache on it..
