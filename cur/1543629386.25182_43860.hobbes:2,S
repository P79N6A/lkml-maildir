No - Davide's is another variant.  All three had similar goals
and similar changes.  MQ was the "first" public one written by
Mike Kravetz and Hubertus Franke with help from a number of others.

The SGI folks may be using more custom scripts.  I think there
is a reasonable set of options in the released package.  OSDL
might also be playing with it (Wookie, are you out here?).  Sequent
used to have a large set of scripts but I don't know where those
are at the moment.  I may check around.

Not surprised.  That seems to be one of our problems with
volanomark testing at the moment and we have some hacks to help,
one in TCP which allows the receiver to be scheduled on a "close"
CPU which seems to help latency.  Others are tweaks of the
scheduler itself, with nothing conclusively better yet.
