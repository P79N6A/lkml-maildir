Userspace tools that are used to configure network are probable not to 
detect this device as a network card and therefore not provide means to 
configure the device (this is a case at least with yast, I don't know what 
is the situation with other configurators).
There might be also other situations, I don't know. Userspace really 
should know the proper class of the device, shouldn't it?
