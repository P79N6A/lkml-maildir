ATI won't even tell us how to do 2D mode setting or clear the code under
NDA that does so. So we don't support AMD (aka ATI) video hardware
anyway. Until they grow up its an irrelevant case.
The problem is how to support the hardware of people who will work sanely
with the free software community and how to do it well.  If it makes life
worse for those who don't then that is their problem.
