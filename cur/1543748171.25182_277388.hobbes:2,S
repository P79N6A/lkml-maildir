Sorry for not replying earlier, I've been away for a few days.
I don't think this is quite needed, because isolated CPUs should
have their domain set to sched_domain_dummy, I think?
The trick would be to just initialise sched_domain_dummy properly;
it looks like that isn't being done for some reason.
Give me a couple of hours and I'll try testing something that
should solve it.
