Yes you can.  Well, you can on ARM at least.  Between the load exclusive
you can do anything you like until you hit the store exclusive.  If you
haven't touched the location (with anything other than another load
exclusive) and no other CPU has issued a load exclusive, your store
exclusive succeeds.  Whether you have branches, loads or stores to
other locations, etc.  None of that matters.
Not so bogus as you make out.
