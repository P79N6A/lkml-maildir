So, you are concerned about the case when the window was maximally
shrunk via check_ra_success because the pages are already cached ?
Is it mainly for small reads that the performance hit due to the 
extra pagecache lookup is significant compared to the cycles spent 
in copy_to_user ? For less than page-sized reads clustering isn't
relevant, we can just keep the old behaviour there.
If on the other hand large cached reads are affected as well, then
we need to work on a solution.
