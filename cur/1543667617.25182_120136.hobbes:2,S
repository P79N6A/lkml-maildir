Yes, I sent out some patches a few evenings ago to lkml that should fix
this problem.  I'm resyncing them with 2.5.66 right now and will send
them to Linus in a bit.
If you want to get around this for now, in the bttv driver, memset the
i2c_client structure to 0 after it is initialized.  That will solve the
problem.
Hope this helps,
