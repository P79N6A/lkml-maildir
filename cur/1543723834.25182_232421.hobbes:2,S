I could not find any information on this in the archives, so I thought I 
might ask it here.
Theoretically, it should be possible to write cardbus driver as a 
regular PCI driver. It will
not support hotplug, of course, but if one can assume that the hardware 
is plugged in by the
time the driver is loaded, it should work. One issue does bother me a 
little bit - cardbus is
connected to the PCI bus through a bridge. The question is - do I have 
to configure that bridge
from my driver (to get memory mappings and interrupts), because 
obviously the OS won't
do it for me when I'm not registered as cardbus driver.
Thanks.
