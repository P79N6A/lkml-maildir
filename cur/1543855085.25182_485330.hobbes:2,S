Heh, never let reality get in the way of a good conspiracy theory.
The stack depth in XFS is more a factor of the complexity of the
XFS space allocation algorithms, and is unrelated to CXFS.
I'm sure if people would point to specific stack issues they would
(continue to) get addressed.  Its just so much easier to speculate
randomly though...
cheers.
