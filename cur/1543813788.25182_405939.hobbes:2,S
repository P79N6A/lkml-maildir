Ah, ok. Sorry for the noise. I had never seen a VCD before. I just tried
to do
	xine vcd:// 
one one of the computers and it worked perfectly.
However, under windows, what I did was simply to open the disc in the
explorer, look at the files, right-click on the largest file to open it
with windows media player, or drag and drop it to copy it on the hard
drive, without any special tool.
I find it a bit deceptive that linux lets me mount the filesystem but not
access the files. It would be actually better, I feel, if mount
would refuse to work on a vcd and display some informative failure
message rather than mount an unreadable filesystem...
Thanks,
	Éric
