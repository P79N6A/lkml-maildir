  It works for me once I got the right options.  Did you enable the
"fasttrak feature"
I'm using the following options in my .config:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y
CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST=y
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_PDC=y
  One major issue for me is that you can use, and mount both the
/dev/ataraid/d0 devices, and the /dev/hd devices.  This makes for lots
of fun in the Red Hat installer, and Cerberus.
