Yes. That's the idea of the application we posted to test the oom
killer ranking at
user space. At least, we are working to put it at boot time and these
suggestions are very helpful.

Yes, your reading is correct, but this choice should take into account
the "patterns"
of how memory is allocated for user's mostly used applications. Why?
The closer the
ranking gets to "The Best choice" the longer it will take to invoke
oom killer again.
I am wondering how could a module control a user space deamon if it
hasn't started
yet? I mean, processes at user space are supposed to start only after
all modules
are loaded (those loadable at boot time). So, this user space deamon
would break
this standard. But if we manage to have a special module that takes
care of loading
this stack of  OOM Killer ranking algorithms, then the deamon would
not need to break
the default order of loading modules. The init could be changed to
start the deamon,
and then the module would start controlling it. Am I right?
So that's why people is complaining every distro would have to update the init
and load this new module. Correct?

Very interesting idea. Will take that into account. Thanks a lot.
