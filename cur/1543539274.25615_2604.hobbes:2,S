	Hello all, Jeff,
> Hi. The definitive site for nbd is Pavel Machek's site:

http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/nbd/nbd.html.
 It has a userland

	[ibrahim]  I downloaded the nbd client/server from the above site
and
	compiled it. I followed the instructions on the web page and I was
able
	to mount device from another PC and use it as a regular partition. 
	I use Red Hat with Kernel 2.2.14-5.0
	Thanks Jeff for the link.
	Regards,
