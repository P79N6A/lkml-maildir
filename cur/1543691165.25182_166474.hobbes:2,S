Hi again,
With 2.6.0-test5, reading the docs, I found that to standby of
suspend, I should try writing to /sys/power/state, but doing so
makes it to try load apm module as it opens /dev/apmbios.  So the
questions are:
	* Is swsusp patches merged with the kernel?
	* How should I suspend/standby with acpi enabled?
	* Where is /proc/acpi/sleep gone?  It used to kinda work.
