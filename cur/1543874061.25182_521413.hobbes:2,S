I see. I guess this was plain luck.

It holds reference to device and prevents its destruction.
If dst is held somewhere, we cannot destroy the device and deadlock
while unregister.
We could not invalidate dst->neighbour but it looked safe to invalidate
neigh->dev after quiescent state. Obviosuly, it is not and it never was safe.
Was supposed to be repaired asap, but this did not happen. :-(

It should be cleared and we should be sure it will not be destroyed
before quiescent state.
Seems, this is the only correct solution, but to do this we have
to audit all the places where dst->neighbour is dereferenced for
RCU safety.
Actually, it is very good you caught this eventually, the bug was
so _disgusting_ that it was "forgotten" all the time, waiting for
someone who will point out that the king is naked. :-)
