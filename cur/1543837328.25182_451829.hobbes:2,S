This is almost *exactly* the same as on my very cheap'n stupid HP/Compaq
desktop P4 HT which doesn't support ACPI C2/C3 at all despite proper support
by other P4 HT desktop machines (missing _CST ACPI object in the DSDT,
as confirmed after messing with Intel's DSDT decompiler):
# cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU?/*
processor id:            0
acpi id:                 1
bus mastering control:   no
power management:        no
throttling control:      yes
limit interface:         yes
active limit:            P0:T0
user limit:              P0:T0
thermal limit:           P0:T0
active state:            C1
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
states:
   *C1:                  type[C1] promotion[--] demotion[--] latency[000] usage[00000000] duration[00000000000000000000]
state count:             8
active state:            T0
states:
   *T0:                  00%
    T1:                  12%
    T2:                  25%
    T3:                  37%
    T4:                  50%
    T5:                  62%
    T6:                  75%
    T7:                  87%
Note that
max_cstate:              C8
can be considered a bug (this is a C state init value from an ACPI define
mistakenly left unchanged in case of missing _CST) since I thus only have C1
and it should thus be set to C1.
What would be interesting is this output *before* any suspend, not after ;)
Oh, and your temperature after boot goes backwards since booting is a very
active period, obviously.
