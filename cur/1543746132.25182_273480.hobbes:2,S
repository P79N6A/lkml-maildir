I've been pondering this again for 2.4.29pre - the thing I'm not sure about 
what negative effect will be caused by not adding anonymous pages to LRU 
immediately on creation.
The scanning algorithm will apply more pressure to pagecache pages initially 
(which are on the LRU) - but that is _hopefully_ no problem because swap_out() will
kick-in soon moving anon pages to LRU soon as they are swap-allocated.
I'm afraid that might be a significant problem for some workloads. No?
Marc-Christian-Petersen claims it improves behaviour for him - how so Marc, 
and what is your workload/hardware description? 
This is known to decrease contention on pagemap_lru_lock.
Guys, doo you have any further thoughts on this? 
I think I'll give it a shot on 2.4.29-pre?
