Modules have lots of little disadvantages that add up.  The speed penalty
on various platforms is one, the load/unload race complexity is another.
There's a widespread "modules are free!" mentality: they're not, and we
can add complexity trying to make them "free", but it might be wiser to
realize that dynamic adding and deleting from a running kernel is a
problem on par with a pagagble kernel, and may not be the greatest thing
since sliced bread.
