It's very relevant.  It is a common occurence in projects which run a CVS
tree.  Accidental reversion of earlier work is a common outcome from the
parallel-tree problem.
One could go on at length as to why this mistake is so easy to make when
you're using CVS, but what it boils down to is that these projects are
using the wrong paradigm.  They're maintaining files, whereas they should
be maintaining *changes* to files.
