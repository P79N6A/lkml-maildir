  Okay, another quick question.
  To fix the io_32bit race problem in ide_taskfile_ioctl() (and later 
ide_cmd_ioctl() too), it seems simplest to mark the taskfile with 
something like ATA_TFLAG_IO_16BIT flag and use the flag in task_in_intr().
  However, ATA_TFLAG_* are used by libata, and I think that, although 
sharing hardware constants is good if the hardware is similar, sharing 
driver-specific flags isn't such a good idea.  So, what do you think?
  1. Add ATA_TFLAG_IO_16BIT to ata.h
  2. Make ide's own set of task flags, maybe IDE_TFLAG_* (including
     IDE_TFLAG_LBA48)
