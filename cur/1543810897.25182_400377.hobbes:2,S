If you can fix things in GNU make within minutes, please fix the
bug that causes GNU make to complain about missing include files.
This is a self non-compliance as GNU make applies all so far known rules
on any other object before trying to use them (e.g. try to check out Makefile
from SCCS before complaining that Makefiles is missing).
If you need the correct algorithm, look into the smake source...
