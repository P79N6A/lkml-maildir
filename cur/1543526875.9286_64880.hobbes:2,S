Hi,
I just spent a few hours trying to make 2.3.47 compile and boot on a
Alpha-XL (266) system. In the end it turned out it only needed this little
patch:

That is: A XL seems to be an apecs machine, not a lca one.

PS: Does anyone why the de4x5 driver sees my network card but does not
show up as eth0?
