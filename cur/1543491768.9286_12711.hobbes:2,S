Are you sure this is with the right System.map?  The symbols look very
odd.  The first oops (not the last) is usually the most important, since
any subsequent oopses may just be side effects of whatever problem
caused the first one.  If you can reproduce this on demand, could you
show what the first oops looks like?  Do you have any modules loaded?
