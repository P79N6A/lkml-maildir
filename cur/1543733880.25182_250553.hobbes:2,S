This is especially true since some architectures may have high overheads 
for this, so you may do normal spinning for a while before you even start 
doing the "fancy" stuff. So there is no ay we should expose this as a 
"generic" interface. It ain't generic. It's very much a low-level 
implementation detail of "spin_lock()".
