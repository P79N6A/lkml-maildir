How do you do this translation? Search through /dev/cpusets?

pfmon, sched_setaffinity, dplace. And this is only what I saw today.
Might develop into a longer list. The 2.4 solutions were rather
complicated.

That leads to lots of complicated scripts doing logical -> physical
translation with the danger of access or attempting accesses to not
allowed CPUs. It may be easier to contain tasks into a range of cpus if
the CPUs in use are easily enumerable.
The view from inside a cpuset could simply be of a system with N cpus
(0..N-1) with N memory areas (0..N-1). No access to outside cpus or memory
us allowed. Kernel checks for valid cpu and memory area by simply checking
against an upper boundary on both and then maps these numbers dynamically
according to the CPU set.
Thats what Simon's patch allows.
The patch would allow the use of the existing tools as if the machine
only had N cpus (as you said a soft partitioning of the machine). If
scripts are to be used with the current approach then they need to know
about all the CPUs in the system and perform the mapping. Its going to be
a nightmare to develop scripts that partition off a 512 cpu cluster
appropriately and that track the physical cpu numbers instead of the cpu
number within the cpuset.
