Tried with it both defined and undefined. When it's defined an extra line is 
added (the last one below) when loading the sata_via module:
sata_via version 1.1
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:0f.0[B] -> GSI 20 (level, low) -> IRQ 20
sata_via(0000:00:0f.0): routed to hard irq line 4
ata3: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xE800 ctl 0xE402 bmdma 0xD400 irq 20
ata4: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xE000 ctl 0xD802 bmdma 0xD408 irq 20
ata3: dev 0 cfg 49:0f00 82:0000 83:0000 84:0000 85:0000 86:0000 87:0000 
88:0007
ata3: dev 0 ATAPI, max UDMA/33
ata3: dev 0 configured for UDMA/33
scsi2 : sata_via
ata4: no device found (phy stat 00000000)
scsi3 : sata_via
ata3: command 0xa0 timeout, stat 0xd0 host_stat 0x1
