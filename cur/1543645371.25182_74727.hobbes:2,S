Nice catch!  Yup, e2fsck will create an empty directory entry, instead
of letting the previous entry absorb the extra space.  Both are legal
ways of doing things, but yes, the kernel does the latter in all cases
except when deleting the last directory entry in a block.  (But that's
OK, because the split code would never need to be invoked on an empty
directory block.)

That patch looks fine.  Push away!

Yes, e2fsprogs is endian-free.  The byte swapping happens in the
library routine ext2fs_read_dir_block() and ext2fs_write_dir_block().
Note that you have to tell these routines whether you're planning on
using the v2 version of dirent struct or not, because that affects
whether or not the name_len field needs to be byte-swapped or not.
