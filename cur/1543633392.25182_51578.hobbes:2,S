Are you really saying that you think serializing all the clients through a
single processor will gain more than than you lose by not using all the
other CPUs for clients?

I've certainly seen a "significant difference" between uni and SMP, but it
was always in the other direction. Is this particular to some hardware, or
running multiple servers somehow? I'm only fmailiar with Linux, AIX and
Solaris, maybe this is Sequent magic? Or were you talking about having
only one client total on the machine and just making that run fast?
