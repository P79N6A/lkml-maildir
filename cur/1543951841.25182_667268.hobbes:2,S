Can you try using /dev/cpu_dma_latency from an user space application.
Refer Documentation/pm_qos_interface.txt for usage. With this interface
you can change menu governor behavior from userspace, by dynamically
allowing it to use C3 or not. I am thinking that something like allowing
C3 for few seconds and blocking it for few seconds may help.
