That looks like Reiserfs to me. You can get lots of files with
just one seek, since small files (with their inode-like data) get
stored inside directories.

That is a layout and cleaner issue.

That adds an extra layer. One of the big goals of Reiserfs is the
elimination of the need for userspace namespaces. That includes any
file format designed to group tiny bits of data for performance on
older filesystem designs.
