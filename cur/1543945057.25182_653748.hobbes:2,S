heh, indeed :-) I saw the double fault and was happy that you showed how 
to fix it (it did not seem obvious to me _at all_, and i've seen my fair 
share of fixes) and i quickly lured myself into having understood it :-/ 
I've now updated the commit message with your (correct) description.

yeah, that's not really practical (especially as it would deplete our 
entropy pool pretty fast would could in some circumstances introduce a 
higher risk to the system than the risk of a canary leaking).
I think we can avoid the leakage across tasks by being careful during 
context-switch time: never calling with the old canary still in the PDA. 
I think this should be fairly easy as we'd just have to load the new 
pdaptr in the switch_to() assembly code.
[ the only (even more academic) possibility here would be an NMI to hit
  during those two instructions that update RSP and load the new pdpptr,
  and leaving the old canary on the stack. But NMIs go to separate stack
  frames anyway on 64-bit so this isnt really a practical worry IMO. ]
Hm?

yeah ... this is the second time i could have used it recently.

yeah, indeed. I fixed the comments and flipped the commits around :-)
TODO: perhaps all vsyscall functions need to move into separate .o 
files. (probably academic as the functions affected by that tend to be 
very simple and do not deal with anything overflowable.)
