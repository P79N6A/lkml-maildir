Hi, 
Attached is teeny patch that sort-of helps make IDE kernel modules 
actually be modular.
I didn't realize that IDE modules weren't supposed to work in 2.4.21pre4
before I started bug hunting.  Then, later,  I accidentally forgot
to disable IDE modules, which lead to further confusion.   The 
attached patch helps a little, but I am presuming that it is probably 
made obsolete by mainstream IDE work.  So this patch is really just 
'FYI'.
