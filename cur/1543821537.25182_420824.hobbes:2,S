Why should we? Getting the mac address and the firmware into the
chip is rather essential to make it work. When there is an #ifdef
around that code, it will only produce a non-working driver that can
be compiled everywhere instead of a driver that can only be compiled
on platforms where it has a chance of working.
If someone has the need to make it work somewhere else, it's easy
enough to change to code to whatever other method is used to set up
the chip.
