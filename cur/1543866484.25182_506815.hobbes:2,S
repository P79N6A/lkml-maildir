  Well, a self relocating image cannot be an ELF file because the code
 to relocate the ELF cannot be executed at the wrong place.
 If relocation is needed, I would better like not to link vmlinux at a
 fixed address first. In fact I wonder if we are talking of the same
 kind of relocation: you seem to talk about "ld --pic-executable" while
 I am thinking of "ld -r" to "locate" it at the bootloader loading time.
  The main problem I see is that I do not have the code for that, and
 I am going deeper/earlier into the generation of vmlinux, while comments
 are "already you are too early, loading an ELF file is too complex for
 a bootloader". The solution I have already is working.

 In fact, thinking more about that, I am going back to my implementation
 of it, because on ia32 the interrupt vectors are at address zero and it is
 obviouly an invalid address to load an ELF for this architecture.
 But for the linker, it is the right address to link it (being an offset
 into a non-null segment in real mode), and because the entry point has
 to be zero (I cannot use the ELF entry value) the program header base
 address has to be zero.
 Anyway, your loader in (probably) written in C, so a test against zero
 is a simple thing to do, and should be done anyway to check for an
 incorrect ELF program header. I wonder if this NOTE program header is
 not simply designed as an "end" marker, it does not seem to contain
 anything, so me defining the realmode after that program header may
 be a good idea.

 If you really are tring to catch an erroneous DMA into the kernel,
 is it better to keep an exact copy of the kernel you are using somewhere
 else to do a bit-to-bit comparisson after the crash, and so no relocate.
 Anyway if the DMA crash has crashed the exception handling area the system
 is dead anyway.

 I think that you are asking too much for the bootloader user, and that
is a decision he has to take *before* the crash; even me, I would select
one address like 16 Mbytes and stick with it...
 If the running Linux kernel do not erase Gujin from memory, it could
also go back to real mode and do a "longjmp()" to return to the
Gujin interface - but most of the times the system had a reason to
crash (for instance a ventilator stopped working) and you can plan
whatever you want in software...
  Thanks,
  Etienne.
