Ah, Ok ;). I was using it in a completly different manner. I was using it
to indicate that the swap cache page was not uptodate on the swap space.
But as just said this cause not ordered write to disk from shrink_mmap().
Other than that it _was_ fine.

I can't understand this. I think to know _where_ to mark the page dirty
(in the `if (vm_op->swapout)' path) but I don't understand _where_ to
write the page out to disk avoiding the fs deadlock. Writing them in
shrink_mmap() would not fix the deadlock (obviously if shrink_mmap() is
still recalled as now by try_to_free_pages() etc...).

OK, agreed ;). I am taking it here in the meantime only because it should
be at least safe.

I still don't understand from _where_ doing the writepage. If we would do
it from shrink_mmap() I can't see how we could clear the pte of the
process (or better processes) before starting the writepage(). Probably I
am missing something of important (maybe because these nights I had not a
lot of time to sleep ;)...
