In Linux, all reclaim is driven by a memory shortage. Often it
is just because more memory is being requested for more file
cache.
My patch does make it a bit more probable that process memory will
be swapped out before file cache is discarded.

But presumably if you are running into memory pressure, you really
will need to free those free list pages, requiring the page to be
read from disk when it is used again.
