But none of the existing GPIO users do that.  The goal wasn't to define
a new notion of GPIO; it was collecting the existing ones under a single
arch-neutral umbrella.

Effectively, yes.  I counted quite a few implementations in the current
tree which can trivially (#defines) map to that API.

The numerous implementations, e.g. on ARM, that effectively are
already using this same API, I'd guess.  The ones that uniformly
reference GPIOs by an integer.

I just checked RC6, and see that at91_mmc doesn't set up routing.
Which is as it should be ... routing is part of board setup, saying
"these pins go to the MMC card".  Pretty much the same with all
other peripherals.  They do have calls to read GPIO values, or in
some cases set them.  But ** NOT ** to route them.

Well, like _you_ are discussing.  I'm mostly pointing out that
pin muxing and configuration is a clearly distinct problem,
with very chip-specific nuances.

Most highly integrated chips nowadays need such functionality.  If you're
keen on it, you could try to abstract a dozen pin mux/setup implementations
and propose an API ... in the same way I did for GPIOs.  :)

And as I've defined those numbers, that's certainly allowed.  But not
required.  I'm just pushing back on the notion that it be required,
since adding such heavy requirements would prevent quick API support
for GPIOs.
