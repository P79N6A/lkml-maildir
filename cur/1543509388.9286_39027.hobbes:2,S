That knowledge is the responsibility of the MTRR driver, but not
necessarily the actions.  If the mem region is not aligned properly, the
driver is in the best position to decide whether it should relocate its
device region, or if that is even possible.
What about a resource flag IORESOURCE_MTRR which indicates a region can
be used with MTRRs?
