Yes.  See the Xen code for running the kernel in ring0 with Xen
(supervisor_mode_kenel).  The hypercall_page is conditionally filled
with hypercall traps or direct calls basically.

I don't have any numbers.

It is a hairy part of VMI.  They've done a nice job of handling the
native case, and have interseting plans for improving the non-native
case (inline where possible).  One of the differences is things that
don't actually require hypercalls are already inline w/ Xen.  So it's
conceivable that the performance hit is smaller than what VMI found
without carefully inlining native code.

It's a different approach.
