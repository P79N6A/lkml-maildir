Subject: 2.2.x & ne2000 compatible = big slowdown compared to 2.0.x

I have the following setup:
Server: 
	- 486DX2 66MHz
	- kernel 2.0.36
	- ISA ne2000 compatible network card
Client:
	- Pentium 233 MHz
	- kernel 2.2.9
	- ISA ne2000 compatible network card
With this setup, any transfer between the two machines never go faster
than 12 KB/sec on FTP transfers and approx 30 KB/sec on HTTP transfers.
Linux 2.2.5 also gave the same results.
However if the client machine is reverted to Linux 2.0.36 then all
transfers go up to 200 KB/sec.
Any idea why there is so a big difference between 2.0.36 and 2.2.9?
