Your problem doesn't look like an SCSI transport error to me. Any SCSI
controller will probably not give better result.
Your device does not like some SCSI command and returns CHECK CONDITION
status, then returns SENSE DATA that are passed to the application
client.
> CDB:  52 01 00 00 00 FF 00 00 1C 00
52 -> READ TRACK INFORMATION.
TRACK BIT=1 TRACK NUMBER=0xff -> track number of the invisible track 
ALLOCATION LENGTH = 0x1C = 28 which looks correct for the size of the 
                              response.
The SCSI command seems correct to me. But given the value of byte 15
(0xC0) of the SENSE DATA, the device wants to tell you about the field
stated invalid with SENSE DATA bytes 16 and 17, but infortunately only 16
bytes are displayed in the trace instead of 18 as it is usual. So, we will
not know.
I would suggest you to report the problem to 'cdrecord' maintainers or to
HP support.
  Gerard.
