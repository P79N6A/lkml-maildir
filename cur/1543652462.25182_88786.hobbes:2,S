If it is an i810 using the onboard video make sure you are using XFree86
4.1/4.2 and the -fixed- (using pci_alloc_*) kernel module for it.
Otherwise you may well get weird happenings
Marcelo's current tree has the kernel stuff, supporting XFree 4.1/4.2,
but 4.2 is IMHO a lot better on i810 especially at 3D.
