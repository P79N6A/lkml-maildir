On PARISC, the cache line contains the following elements:
	1) data (obviously)
	2) physical page
	3) dirty/clean/public/private/etc state
A cache access hits or misses depending on whether or not the physical page from
the TLB matches the physical page stored in the cache line.
If flushing is required during fork on PARISC, then there are cache consistency
issues elsewhere, something is horribly broken in the design (and it should be
falling all over anyway).
