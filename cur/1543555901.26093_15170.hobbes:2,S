If you are writing the sort of code that cares which section it ends up
in, you need to use __attribute__((section)).  You probably will be
using things like __attribute__((align)) as well.  Relying on compiler
behavior here is dangerous.
I agree though that an option is called for, either -fassume-bss-zero
or -fno-assume-bss-zero, not sure which should be the default.
