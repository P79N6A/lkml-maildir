I don't understand what people want in that particular kind
of case.  I made software fp emulation fixes, four of them to
be precise.  And on the first line I describe in general what
I'm doing, which is soft-fp bug fixes :-)
I do the same thing for a batch of sparc64 fixes, the first
line always is the toplevel description:
sparc64 fixes:
which proceeds the actual details:
- Fix signal blah handling
- Don't bleh during ptrace
- Disable interrupts around foo
- Fix IP checksum calculations when bar
Now tell me what is more appropriate on the first line and
I'll consider it :-)
