Yes, it can fail, and this is normal.  The problem is in
ndisc_send_ns().

A few lines later we setup saddr properly if it is NULL, what we need
to do is either:
1) Move that "if (saddr == NULL)" code block up above the send_llinfo
   check.
   I think this would break the thing the send_llinfo check
   was meant to fix, but I can't be sure.
2) Just check for NULL saddr in the send_llinfo check and if NULL
   then send_llinfo is set to zero.
For now, I've put solution #2 into my tree, patch attached below.
