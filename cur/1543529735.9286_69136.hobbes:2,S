Hi,
  is there any reason why SHM must be mounted on /var/shm? If I have
mounted it in /shmfs, it does following (with xawtv):
strace:
   shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, 221184, IPC_CREAT|0x1ff|0666) = 65538
   shmat(65538, 0, 0)                                = -1 EINAL
ipcs:
key         shmid   owner   perms   bytes   nattach  status
0x00000000  65538   root    777     221184  0
ls -la /shmfs (except strange empty entry):
-rwxrwxrwx  1  root   root    221184 Mar 13 12:19 .IPC_00010002
  When I mounted it in /var/shm, it works. Could not shm code start
walking tree in shmfs root instead of in real root on path /var/shm?
Have I different SHM namespace if I mount shm in chrooted environment?
  Unfortunately, I do not have address of author of shm changes, so
I'm asking here.
                                        Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
