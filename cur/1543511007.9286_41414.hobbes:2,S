I just now have a way to produce the crash as of tonight.
What I need to know is what parallel races are we referring/hunting and
against which kernels?
Alan just pointed out one location last night.
It is now 10:00pm here and I have about 4 hours of brain left.
I will check back in about 15 minutes.
I am off to grab AC's latest and see what "Andrea A." has to offer about
finding the races.
