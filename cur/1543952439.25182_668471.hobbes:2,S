You are right Peter, that fs/file.c contains some leftover from previous 
implementation of defer queue,
that was using a timer.
So we can probably provide a patch that :
- Use spin_lock() & spin_unlock() instead of spin_lock_bh() & 
spin_unlock_bh() in free_fdtable_work()
since we dont anymore use a softirq (timer) to reschedule the workqueue.
( this timer was deleted by the following patch :
http://readlist.com/lists/vger.kernel.org/linux-kernel/50/251040.html
But, you cannot avoid use of spin_lock()/spin_unlock() because 
schedule_work() makes no garantee that the work will be done by this cpu.
(free_fdtable_work() can be called to flush the fd defer queue of CPU X 
on behalf CPU Y,   with X != Y .
You then can have a corruption because CPU X is inside 
free_fdtable_rcu() and CPU Y is inside free_fdtable_work() )
So both spin_lock() and get_cpu_var() are necessary :
- One to get the precpu data for optimal performance on SMP (but not 
mandatory)
- One to protect the data from corruption on SMP.
