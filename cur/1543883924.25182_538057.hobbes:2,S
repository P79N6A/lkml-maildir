Hi Eric,
Following are program headers of my core file. They look sane.

First PT_LOAD header is mapping kernel text/data and others just mapping
physical memory in kernel linear virtual address range.

Given the fact it works well with gdb 6.4 as well as 6.1 (crash uses gdb 6.1
as backend and crash is working fine). I would think that it is gdb bug.

I would consider gdb to be equally important, especially because many
a times crash is broken with latest version of kernels (as some data
structures or some mechanism has changed) and gdb is the only one who
can open the dump.
