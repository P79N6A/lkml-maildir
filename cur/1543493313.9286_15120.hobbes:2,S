Well, alrighty then.  Your patch worked.  At least, /proc/mtrr is now
there, and can be interfaced with.  How to verify that X takes
advantage of it?  I saw some docs on framebuffer  stuff with mtrr, but
can't remember where...
Anyhow, the patch applied smoothly to 2.2.6 except for vesafb.c. 
Here's what I used:

        fb_info.changevar = NULL;
I'm not sure how  much of a difference that change makes, but it's
working ok, now, so...
Is Linus just waiting for stability reports on the AMD/Cyrix code
before he includes it in the kernel?  If so, what types of tests could
I run and submit to test it's stability?
