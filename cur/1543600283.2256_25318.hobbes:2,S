Basically, I don't like that idea. 'insmod -f' should only be
required if the module in question is some kind of a commercial (TM)
module. Setting a "GPL/BSD" flag might be somewhat interesting
(but enlarges needed on-disk-space), but I don't like to help
those commercials to ease the use of their broken, binary-only
modules.
