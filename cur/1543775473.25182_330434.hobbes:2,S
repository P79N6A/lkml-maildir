This is a matter of taste, and I decided upon sizeof(type) after a
discussion with Al Viro on this subject.
I believe the overwealming argument for sizeof(type) as opposed to
sizeof(expression) is that you can identify easily where likely
initialisations happen, and therefore places which need to be
properly updated if/when you change the type.
I'm also sending this to Al so he can give his point of view on
sizeof(type) vs sizeof(expression).
