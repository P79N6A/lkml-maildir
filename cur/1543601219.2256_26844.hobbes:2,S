Hi!
I suppose there is a bug in the 2.4-kernel console driver 
(../drivers/char/console.c).
It seems that (if there is a slow video device) this driver disables the 
handling of interrupts while writing or switching the consoles. 
Symptoms:
If you use the VESA framebuffer, switching to another console prevents 
updating the internal kernel clock (jiffies, xtime) for a short time. 
This effect can grow up to some seconds:
Load the GNU Midnight Commander (mc) and synchronize kernel clock and 
hardware clock with the command 'hwclock --hctosys'.
Then you can see the the difference with 'hwclock && date'.
  # hwclock && date
  Sun Sep 16 10:31:33 2001  -0,154753 ...
  Sun Sep 10 10:31:32 CEST 2001
Now hold down the keys <Ctrl+o> for a some seconds. (This switches the 
window of the Midnight Commander on/off many times)
If you now compare the clocks you yield a difference of some seconds:
  # hwclock && date
  Sun Sep 16 10:33:17 2001  -0,456384 ...
  Sun Sep 16 10:33:12 CEST 2001
5 seconds - I think this is a bug.
My system:
Intel Pentium II, 512 MB RAM
NVIdia Riva TNT2 M64 with 32 MB
Kernel 2.4.4 and 2.4.7
SuSE Linux 7.2
VESA Framebuffer 
Greetings
Michael
