There is one lockd running.  I tried this using Solaris 2.5 - 2.7, with
the jumbo patches, and still no locks, stock 2.2.10 kernel,
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y and CONFIG_LOCKD=y.  Mounts of NFS exports from the
Solaris boxes simply do not mount with locks.  Am I doing something
wrong? The Solaris boxes have no trouble mounting from these exports and
getting locks.  I am using rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard .
