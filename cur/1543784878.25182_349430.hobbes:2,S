Actually if you look closer it is a bit smarter than sysvinit and
includes latent functionality that the distros will eventually pick up
on to increase boot speed and allow parallel starting of services (it
codifies boot dependencies with provides and requires - not just boot
order like svsvinit).
http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/initscrcomconv.html
For example an extract from /etc/init.d/vmware
# Basic support for the Linux Standard Base Specification 1.3
# Used by insserv and other LSB compliant tools.
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: VMware
# Required-Start: $network $syslog
# Required-Stop:
# Default-Start: 2 3 5
# Default-Stop: 0 6
# Short-Description: Manages the services needed to run VMware software
# Description: Manages the services needed to run VMware software
### END INIT INFO
And whether you think it is awful or not - it is the closest thing we
have to universal in Linux land (which is what the original poster was
asking) ie. all of the major distros are aiming for LSB conformance.
