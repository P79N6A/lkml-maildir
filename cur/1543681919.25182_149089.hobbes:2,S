I don't think this has any to do with the calculation, you probably just have to use:
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE=y
(well, combined with...
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_PDC=y
...and a lot of other options...)
With 2.4.20 the FORCE option had to be set at "n", now it should be set at "y".

Avoiding floating-point precision,  this would do the same as your calculation:
lba = ideinfo->capacity - ideinfo->sect;
However, I don't think the expression "fails". the way it is expressed now, it will divide something integer-wise and then multiply it with the same value (and then minus sect), thus I assume this was intended: To round the capacity value to the next multiple of (head * start),  and then do a minus sect...
I don't think any hardcore programmer ever does a integerwise divide /before/ an integerwise multiply without a very good reason... (And don't give me that "you'd be surprised"!!!)
