Still, I've looked into possibly reverse engineering the Broadcom
one for 802.11g from MacOS X (with 2 machines kernel debugging and
functions names embedded in the driver, it's not _that_ bad). But
it's a +500k binary .... I didn't go very far and decided I had
better ways to spend my time.
I know a lot of you don't care, but I hate in those discussions
about binary drivers when what is for me the #1 issue isn't even
mentioned: availability on non-x86 hardware !
Ben.
