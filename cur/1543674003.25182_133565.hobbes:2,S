Subject: Re: [PATCH] Process Attribute API for Security Modules 2.5.69
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch, relative to the /proc/pid/attr patch against 2.5.69, fixes
the mode values of the /proc/pid/attr nodes to avoid interference by the
normal Linux access checks for these nodes (and also fixes the
/proc/pid/attr/prev mode to reflect its read-only nature).  Otherwise,
when the dumpable flag is cleared by a set[ug]id or unreadable
executable, a process will lose the ability to set its own attributes
via writes to /proc/pid/attr due to a DAC failure (/proc/pid inodes are
assigned the root uid/gid if the task is not dumpable, and the original
mode only permitted the owner to write).  The security module should
implement appropriate permission checking in its [gs]etprocattr hook
functions.  In the case of SELinux, the setprocattr hook function only
allows a process to write to its own /proc/pid/attr nodes as well as
imposing other policy-based restrictions, and the getprocattr hook
function performs a permission check between the security labels of the
current process and target process to determine whether the operation is
permitted.
