The problem is that LILO tries one or the other, instead of dynamically
using whichever one it needs.  Heck, you may not be able to make that
decision until boot time anyway!  You can then either always try LBA
calls and see if they are available, or default to CHS calls unless
cylinder > 1023.
LILO tries to do *way* too much at install time.  The fact that you have
to specify "linear" explicitly is a joke -- there is no excuse for
!linear.
