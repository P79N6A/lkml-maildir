Hi,
Just a quick note..
iirc, virtual interfaces are necessary in order to configure multiple
IP addresses using "ifconfig", but if you use iproute2's tools you can
add any/all IPs to one interface (the original, eg eth0, br0, vlan0001
etc) with a command like "ip addr add 12.3.45.66/28 dev eth0" and then
all the addresses are considered equal; although ifconfig will only
list one of the IPs (it appears that it is restricted to
"understanding" only one IP per interface)
Cheers,
Lee Causier.
