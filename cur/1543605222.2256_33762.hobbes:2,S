This is a "feature" of the st driver: if you get UNIT ATTENTION anywhere
else than within open(), it is considered an error. In most cases this is
true but MTLOAD is an exception. I have not thought about this exception
and noone before you has reported it ;-)
As you say, the workaround is to close and reopen the device after MTLOAD.
You should not need the second MTLOAD.
I will think about a fix to this problem. The basic reason for not
allowing UNIT ATTENTION anywhere is that flushing the driver state
properly in any condition is complicated and there has been no legitimate
reason to allow this. However, here it should be sufficient to use a no-op
SCSI command after LOAD to get the UNIT ATTENTION.
