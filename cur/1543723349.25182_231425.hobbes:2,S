Hello,
my box behaves a bit strange after "shutdown -h".  The system performs a
clean shutdown, but afterwards the front-side power button doesn't
power-on anymore.  After turning off power completely for 5 - 10 sec
using the power supply's rear-side switch system boots again.  I found a
hint that this might be caused by a power supply that doesn't fully
conform to ATX 2.01.  Though this might be the real cause of my problem,
I'd like to know if there is a workaround.  Shutting down from an older
Knoppix-CD (kernel 2.4.20 using apm) works fine, i.e. "front-side
power-on" works.  However, with 2.6 running on a SMP box there seems to
be no way to poweroff via apm.
Is there a way to let machine_power_off() behave like apm_power_off() on
a SMP box?
My system:
kernel:	2.6.7-mm1 (same with other 2.4 and 2.6)
CPU:	2 x Athlon MP
board:	Tyan Tiger MPX (S2466)
TIA
