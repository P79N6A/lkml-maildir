Hello all hackers, from 2.0 to 2.4,
In setup.S,  from the very beginning (in boot/boot.s for 0.01 kernel),
all boot GDT limits are set to 0x800. GDT limit is the LIMIT, not SIZE.
So all these 0x800 should be 0x7ff. And actually in the current 2.4.24,
it is even an odd 0x8000 which I previously just sent a patch to fix to
0x800. But it should be set to 0x7ff really.  Until now only 2.6 sets it
properly. Although these will never cause any runtime problem at all,
they are ugly. Please consider fix them.
Since it is always 0x800, i even get used to 0x800 rather then the
proper 0x7ff. If leave it 0x800, it's useful to distinguish the boot GDT
from the later final GDT setting in arch/i386/kernel/head.S. So fix it
or not.
Regards,
Coywolf
