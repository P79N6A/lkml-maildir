Good idea. Seems I have hit the edge of current
features. That's is good for now there is another food
item for a TODO list.

Ok. That's another area for me to research. edac does
not have any /dev/ entries, just the files and
controls previous mentioned. 
So, from your comment then, udev has some mechanism to
set controls in sysfs?

Yes, I have LDD 3rd and it is good. I have also have
Robert Love's book and it has some good stuff on the
device model and sysfs, but I assume since the whole
feature is fairly new its documentation and
understanding are still in the nursery.
I also came across Patrick Mochel's paper given at
Linux Symposium in June 2005. That helped.
From the src on the machinecheck currently in sysfs, I
see it implements the 'subsystem' feature of sysfs.
From that code I see the pattern I can use.

at least there is some docs AND some people to ask
questions to.
