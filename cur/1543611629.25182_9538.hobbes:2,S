Hmm.. i'll look into that. If it keeps oopsing, i'll send you the dump.

True. Actually, they're older. 0.08b seems current.

I've tried the wvlan_cs driver. It works for a few inutes, then gets all
messed up and need to be reset. When it's hosed, iwconfig just dumps out a
lot of garbage, making me think the driver is writing all over itself.
Haven't tried this driver in UP mode.
I've also tried Lucent's binary driver, but it doesn't work at all. It will
allow a single packet to be sent then shuts down the tranceiver and changes
to channel 0 (?!) then needs to be reset before another single packet can be
sent, then shuts down the tranceiver again, etc, etc.. (this happens on
several UP and SMP machines).

Well, Gibson's the one who suggested the broblem was with the pcmcia system,
and not the orinoco driver! Hmm.... can you say runaround?
Basically, before about 2.4.14, the orinoco driver would go haywire and dump
out lots of errors (Gibson is familiar with them) and need to be manually
reset. On more recent kernels however, instead of the driver crapping out
with errors, the system just hard locks.
