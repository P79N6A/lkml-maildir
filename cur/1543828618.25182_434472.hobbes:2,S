Don't be silly.  Whatever solution is arrived at will boot on all 
systems.  That's an obvious operational requirement.
This is how new technology always works in Linux.  We turn it on and see 
what works, and what doesn't.  And whether existing problems will 
disappear.  With MSI, I think we see them disappearing.
Newer systems seem to be doing better with MSI, in part because 
PCI-Express and other technologies trend towards MSI-style operation.
And the kernel's MSI code is finally getting cleaned up, and getting the 
attention it needs.

IMO that's an exaggeration.  On 50% of the x86-64 platforms (Intel), MSI 
has been working for quite some time.  On newer systems in the other 
half of the platforms, MSI seems be more usable than it has been in the 
past.
