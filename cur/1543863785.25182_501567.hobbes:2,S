This bug seems to be in the kernel's "memory management", and the last memory-related bug I had
(caused by a bad DIMM on another machine) caused creeping filesystem corruption. However, this
machine is my main desktop, and so I am keen to keep the filesystems intact. So yes, that involves
not running a kernel that has shown itself to be unreliable. 
I was hoping that someone with a deeper knowledge of the differences between 2.6.18 and 2.6.19
would have an idea of what might have triggered this problem, and yes, I was also thinking that
some more people would trip over it and help debug it.
But anyway - can someone please tell me what "Eeek! page_mapcount(page) went negative! (-1)" is
*really* saying/implying? Because I am currently translating this as "I WANT TO EAT YOUR
FILESYSTEMS".
Cheers,
Chris
