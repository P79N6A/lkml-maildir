This initial ramdisk "initrd" seems to work with the patch submitted
yeaterday, but user-mode ramdisk doesn't retain data and the loop-back
device doesn't write back data to the file that was mounted via
loop.
This means that I can boot the new kernel with an initial ram-disk,
but I can't make a new one when using the new kernel.
