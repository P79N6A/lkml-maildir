Very simple: there is no fool-proof way to do this.
How do you handle...
    * users behind firewalls
    * UUCP mail users
    * mail-only accounts that cannot be verified
    * other misc ISP funkiness
    * users whose machine cannot be reached... i.e. my machine is
      escape.widomaker.com but you'll never be able to reach it
      so is the verification and subscription software going to
      be smart enough to check/allow <user>@<domain> instead of
      insisting on finding a match at an exact machine?
The last issue has given me a lot of grief for some mailing lists
because my mail headers were rewritten to lose my machine name
and so they could not verify me.  In fact, sometimes I could not
even unsubscribe.
Most people are at the mercy of their ISP so they cannot always
fix things themselves.  As time goes on, this will likely get worse
since ISPs need only cater to Windows users who could not care less
about how their headers look.
