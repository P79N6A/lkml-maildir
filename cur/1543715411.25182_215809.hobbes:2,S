I am not sure if enabling timestamps will help.
From RFC1323,
  It is recommended that RST segments NOT carry timestamps, and that RST
  segments be acceptable regardless of their timestamp. Old duplicate RST
  segments should be exceedingly unlikely, and their cleanup function should
  take precedence over timestamps.
It looks like linux follows this recommendataion.
tcp_input.c: tcp_rcv_established()
        if (tcp_fast_parse_options(skb, th, tp) && tp->saw_tstamp &&
            tcp_paws_discard(tp, skb)) {
                if (!th->rst) {
                        NET_INC_STATS_BH(PAWSEstabRejected);
                        tcp_send_dupack(sk, skb);
                        goto discard;
                }
                /* Reset is accepted even if it did not pass PAWS. */
        }
Thanks
