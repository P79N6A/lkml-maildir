Sounds reasonable.  It would be cool if we didn't have to do this.
(Why isn't the mqueue fs not MS_NOUSER?)  Ah well.
I'm not certain about requiring CLONE_NEWNS but it looks to be
ugly if we try and work it the other way.

I don't believe the harmless part.  Creating new objects should really
come after we have the code to really make them work.  In some sense
the next patch which makes this work causes ABI breakage.  Closely
packed together it doesn't matter but...
