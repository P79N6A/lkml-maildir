Hello,
This is my first posting, so apologies if the answer to the question is
obvious to many of you. I have done a lot of investigation before I posted.
I have been attempting to isolate a hang in the Kernel which I suspect is
due to the HP insight manager daemon cmaidad. What I really need is a quick
explanation of the task_list pointers I see in the wait queues.
Here is an example of a task where I/O never returns for cmaidad. At the
bottom I get the data from the wait_queue structure and it does not make
sense to me.

Questions
-----------
The task_list next and previous are set the same, I assume this means there
is only one task on the wait queue.
Now the values:
I cannot find how to see the waiting task from the task list pointers. I
guess these are really the list_head pointers.
I cannot find these addresses in any of the task pointers, so how do I get
the task descriptors on the wait queues from these in the crash dump. 
Thanks for the help.
