I have a few questions: How stable is firewire (running at 800Mbps or
faster, if any is available yet)? How stable is the Linux subsystem,
especially for firewire disks? Is there any particularly 800Mbps bridge
chips that should be avoided or used?
How stable is the subsystem when the chain is nearly full (62 devices is
full right?)
How many controllers may be in the system before the Firewire subsystem
gets confused?
