Subject: [PATCH] double semicolon cleanup, kernel 2.6.5-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/31/78

the attached patch cleans up a larger amount of superfluos 
";;" statements in current Linux kernel sources by converting
them to the regular single ";" statments.
it seems to be a common problem that at the end of a line 
the semicolon key is producing an echo.
that sort of noise is simply unneccessary source code 
and can be cleaned up without any danger.
since the attached patch is not generated by some filter,
it does care about assembler code with ";;" and it does care 
about "for(;;)" constructs which of course must reamin as they are.
-Alex.
