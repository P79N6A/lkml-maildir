The only thing here is that it has to be obvious not only to you, but to the
judge too :)
In this case, it is not comments, but proper copyright attribution, which was
added in the tg3.c case since the first checkin :
/*
 * tg3.c: Broadcom Tigon3 ethernet driver.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 David S. Miller (davem@redhat.com)
 * Copyright (C) 2001, 2002, 2003 Jeff Garzik (jgarzik@pobox.com)
 * Copyright (C) 2004 Sun Microsystems Inc.
 *
 * Firmware is:
 *      Copyright (C) 2000-2003 Broadcom Corporation.
 */
The firmware part was not present in the original checkin you did in 2002.
Adding something about the licencing status of it would be enough.
Or even adding some comment in the toplevel COPYING file saying that firmware
blobs come under their own licence or something such, and then listing all the
firmware blobs and their licencing condition in a separate toplevel file would
be enough.
Friendly,
