It's not obvious to me why the kernel would hang with an invalid pointer
error message there: ipc_lock appears to have good safety against being
passed a random id.  Perhaps the invalid pointer message comes from
other code you've not shown (for example, I hope you shm_unlock(shp)
and return 1 when shm_lock succeeds), or perhaps I'm misreading.
But what you're doing there looks entirely weird and meaningless to me:
if shm_lock happens to succeed or fail on the inode number of some file
on some filesystem, that tells you nothing about whether that file is
SysV shm or not.  Ah, I see ipc/shm.c saves id in i_ino: so if you're
dealing with a SysV shm file, then indeed that ought to tell whether
you're dealing with a SysV shm file - but that hasn't helped much!
Since you're already patching base kernel source (you mention
arch/xyz/mm/fault.c), why don't you just patch your own VM_SYSVSHM
into include/linux/mm.h, and set it on the vma in ipc/shm.c?
