Oh, I agree that it should be there for the generic option, but I think
it is legitimate to have it disabled for MK8.  I'll defer to you though

I actually tried __setup during development of this code, and it didn't
work.  The problem was that __setup, while called early, it is not
called until after setup_arch (and we need to know our table size when
detect_calgary is called at the end of setup_arch).
