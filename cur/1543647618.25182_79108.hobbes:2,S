Doesn't bdflush let you control this? I noted in my first post that we'd
played with changing bdflush params as described here:
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-fs8.html?dwzone=linux
And set them to this:
[root@server5 hm]# cat /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
39      500     0       0       60      300     60      0       0
Shouldn't this reduce it to writing every 3 seconds? We tried lowering some
of the values even further based on the description here:
http://www.bb-zone.com/zope/bbzone/docs/slgfg/part2/cha04/sec04
So we altered the first one (nfract) to 10(%) to try and keep the dirty
buffer list small, but that didn't help either. I sort of thought that
age_buffer at 3 seconds would be more likely to activate anyway than 40% of
buffers being dirty?

So you're saying that ext3 is somehow breaking the standard kernel writeback
code? Is this something they know about, and/or are addressing?
