If they arn't SCSI, don't treat them like they are.

Amen to this... It is a very definite need. And if I may add my $0.02 US, a
unified IDE/ATA/ATAPI API for Linux will make Linux more likely to take its
place on the desktop. As it stands, I have to fiddle with things more than I
like to to get my CD-RW to work with both CD-R and Packet Writing.
