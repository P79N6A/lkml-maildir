This is on an IBM Thinkpad T23:
cpufreq: Intel(R) SpeedStep(TM) support $Revision: 1.7.2.2 $
cpufreq: chipset 0x3 - processor 0x2
cpufreq: read at pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50 returned 0x0
cpufreq: read at pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50 returned 0x0
cpufreq: writing 0x1 to pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50
cpufreq: read at pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50 returned 0x1
cpufreq: change to 0 MHz succeded
cpufreq: read at pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50 returned 0x1
cpufreq: read at pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50 returned 0x1
cpufreq: writing 0x0 to pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50
cpufreq: read at pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50 returned 0x0
cpufreq: change to 598 MHz succeded
cpufreq: read at pmbase 0x1000 + 0x50 returned 0x0
cpufreq: currently at high speed setting - 598 MHz
CPU clock: 598.500 MHz (731.500-598.500 MHz)
The low speed setting looks ok, but the high one is obviously wrong.
It's a 1.13Ghz CPU, /proc/cpuinfo lists it as this:
vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
cpu family	: 6
model		: 11
model name	: Intel(R) Pentium(R) III Mobile CPU      1133MHz
stepping	: 1
cpu MHz		: 1132.406
cache size	: 512 KB
The chipset in this machine is an Intel i830 chipset.  Let me know if
there's anything else useful I could do to provide further info.
