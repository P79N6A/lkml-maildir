The obvious question is this: How many of those warnings also occur
with the pristine source - i.e., the -rc1 without the -ac4 source. It
would probably be best to wade through the -rc1 sources fixing those
first, then worry about the -ac* sources once those have been merged
in.
Best wishes from Riley.
