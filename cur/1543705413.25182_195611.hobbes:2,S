This is starting to get stupid: I tried recreating the oops with rc2 and 
rc2-mm2, but this time they started up normal. Currently I am even using 
a mm2 based kernel. But 2.6.2-rc3 still oopses. The problem is it 
happens at kernel init time (libata doing its init) and thus I cannot do 
a dmesg. I don't have a serial console, neither. But I wrote down the 
functions called, if that is of help. I tried the kmsgdump patch to 
write the dmesg down to floppy, but either it didn't work or I am too 
stupid. Well, tell me whether it still helps making a bug report. Is 
there a way to make kernel more verbose? I mean all the acpi messages 
only appear in the log and not on screen. Then i could at least rite 
things down by hand, though it is not very inviting...
SO pleae specify which infos of the oopsing kernel you need 
specifically, minimisind my time in writing stuff down.
If you think you can work with above (lack of) informations, I will open 
a bug report and give you all the acpi and dmi dumps, etc.. you wanted.
  Here is the interrupt list, btw.
