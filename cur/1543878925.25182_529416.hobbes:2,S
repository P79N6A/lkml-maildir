Why should VMI add workaround into PIT code?  PIT code wants to know 
nothing about VMI.  It understands PIT timers on hardware.  VMI, on the 
other hand, is special - it knows exactly what hardware platform it has 
and can manipulate hardware freely.  On a generic platform, surely touch 
PIT I/O ports would be quite ill behavior.  But side effects of that on 
a vastly restricted platform are predictable based on the hardware and 
kernel, and we would not add a workaround outside of VMI unless it was 
really necessary or generally useful.
