Hmm, not sure what you're talking about - I have both serial ports working
fine, sharing one IRQ.  Not sure what the regions 3-5 are for though...
If you have a parport IRQ sharing patch to test, you can send it to me.
The card is just a bare NM9835 chip + two GD75232 chips (RS232 drivers),
no configuration EEPROM mounted, so all data is from the NM9835 defaults
and all such cards should work the same way...

OK, I'll try to be patient ;)
