Well, the use in hysdn can (and should) die, possibly by adding an
#ifndef CONFIG_PROC_FS
#error This driver won't work without procfs
#endif
until fixed properly.

I don't know, I suspect it needs it for something like firmware loading or 
so. But since that's obviously an abuse of /proc, it's okay to have it 
break IMO.

Yes. I'll look into that and fix it properly - I think just exchanging 
probably gives the same kind of problem for CONFIG_ISDN ;(
