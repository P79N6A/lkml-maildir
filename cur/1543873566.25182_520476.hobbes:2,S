Yeah, I noticed the capslock works.  Networking doesn't come back up
though, and it doesn't seem to answer to command that I type blindly.
Even trying to do something like..
pm-suspend ; dmesg >dmesg.out; /sbin/reboot
doesn't seem to execute the commands on resume.
Switching tty's to X with alt-f7 seems to lock it up to the point that
even capslock doesn't work any more.
I'll try and hook up a usb serial cable and see if I'm lucky enough
to get something useful out of it in the absense of a serial port..
