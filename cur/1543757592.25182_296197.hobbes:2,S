Nice. I have done something similar for the buddy allocator but never
got around to sending it.

The format is not really easy to parse, it probably makes sense to
split the two parts into separate files. I also think that debugfs
would be a more appropriate place to put this in than procfs.

The housekeeping that is needed for the hash implementation is rather
complicated. The code that I wrote did a static allocation from inside
a macro, like
#define kmalloc(_size, _gfp) \
	({ \
		static struct kma_caller _caller \
			__attribute__((section(".kmalloc.data"))) = { \
			.func = __FUNCTION__, \
			.line = __LINE__, \
		}; \
		_caller.count++; \
		_caller.size += (_size); \
		__kmalloc((_size), (_gfp)); \
	})
Then I could simply print out all allocations by walking through the
special linker section. OTOH, your implementation has the advantage
that it can directly match kmalloc/kfree pairs and that it does not
rely on special linker magic.
