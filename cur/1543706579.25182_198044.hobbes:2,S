A quick note about standard lists then - circular double-linked
lists are normally described in textbooks as a clever trick
allowing to avoid if's in insert() and delete(). Given what you
have noted about CMP speed above, I wonder if simple 0-terminated
lists would be something to consider for lower-end i386.
