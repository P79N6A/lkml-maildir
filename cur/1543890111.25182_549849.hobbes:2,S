Actually, it seems to be worse than that - the PNP entry for my cmos 
clock doesn't appear to mention an irq, so the wakealarm entry doesn't 
work. I can happily wake it using the /proc/acpi/alarm interface.
David, would you be happy with hardcoding the rtc-cmos IRQ to 8 on PCs 
if there's inadequate PNP information available?
