Automatic tuning is a way to set the limit to unlimited, in a sense, 
doesn't it? With this feature, we can leave the default limits as they 
are for an "every-day" usage, and when a particular application runs on 
the machine, authorize the limit to grow up as needed.

As I told Eric Biederman in another mail, DoS in ensured in AKT by 
exporting the min and max values for each tunable to sysfs (actually 
Eric complained about these min and max :-( ). These are RW atrributes 
that make it possible for a sysadmin to set the max value a tunable can 
ever reach, instead of letting it grow up to huge values.

Agree with you, BUT between the default max_files and the "too many 
files" situation, there is a gap that can be crossed by automatically 
tuning max_files, isn't there? e.g. max_file default value is NR_FILE 
(0x2000), while Oracle expects to have it set to 0x10000.
