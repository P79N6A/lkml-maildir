I noticed that anotehr thing that changed between vanilla 2.4.13pre2 and
2.4.13pre3 is the setting of page_cluster on machine with lots of ram.
You'll now find the page_cluster set to 6, that means "1 << 6 << 12"
bytes will be paged in at each major fault, while previously only "1 <<
4 << 12" bytes were paged in.
So I'd suggest to try again after "echo 4 > /proc/sys/vm/page-cluster"
to see if it makes any difference.
