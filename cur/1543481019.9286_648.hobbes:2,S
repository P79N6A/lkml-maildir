I've had close to 100% failure rate on quantum fireballs (and the dec
rz-26l which is also a quantum fireball) inside the warranty period on
some generations of quantum fireballs in our news/cache servers. To the
point that I've given up on rmaing them because quantum just keeps sending
me more fireballs. Conversly the quantum ATLAS and ATLAS-II drives I have
(their spendy line) have been among the most reliable disks I have with
some from 1995 still part of spool or overviews volumes on high traffice
news servers.
