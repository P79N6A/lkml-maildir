By the way, looking at nearby code:
	else {
		/* FIXME, make a readl uuid parser */
		printk(KERN_INFO "device fsid %llx-%llx ",
		       *(unsigned long long *)disk_super->fsid,
		       *(unsigned long long *)(disk_super->fsid + 8));
	}
aside from the readl typo here, it occurs to me that this is not
endian-safe, because AFAIK nothing ever swaps disk_super->fsid ... so
this would produce possibly confusing output if someone ever moved
storage with a btrfs filesystem on it from one endianness to another...
