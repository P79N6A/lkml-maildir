Hello,
I posted the message about squid earlier.
Now here's a logfile from an manually invoked uucp-session:

There's a great time-warp in the system cloxck settings.
These two lines were executed while I was watching the logfile.
The mail delivery took under a second but you see the difference.
cheers,
Patrick
PS: There was another person reporting clock anomalities.
    PLEASE DON'T IGMORE THAT. It's a BUG. I only changed the kernel.
