Jan
lets see to the following scenario:
	1) I've taken a pure Linux kernel (no .config at all)
	2) I started menuconfig, made a few changes and saved the file
	to .config1 as alternate
	3) Then I made some additional changes
	4) Then I'm getting out of menuconfig and of course "Save
	configuration..?" question is raising. Ok, I'm selecting
	"Yes" and as result new configuration will be written to the .config
	file. All works as it should be...
...but as you mentoined in your message "perhaps all Office Suites do
the same" - no, Office do not the same. The only question I have
(and it could resolve all our problems) - what an alternate config
file is:
	- just a snapshot of a config tree at moment of its writting
	- _working_ file to which configurator should write parameters
your comments?
P.S.
Excuse for poor eng. grammar
