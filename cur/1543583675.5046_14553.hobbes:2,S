I believe it's because the Twin Turbo was introduced into the kernel via
the PPC kernel port - was there actually a TT board for PCs? I'm not
talking about bus (the TTs were all PCI, IIRC), but rather the firmware on
the board - does it work on x86? If not, can it be flashed? If it can't,
you're out of luck.
