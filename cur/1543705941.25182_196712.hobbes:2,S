Got this when tried to run mplayer (mplayer played something audible for 
1 sec and then stalled):
irq 7: nobody cared!
Call Trace:

handlers:

Disabling IRQ #7
sound module in use is intel8x0 as seen above. Chip itself is nforce2
integrated audio.
I know there were problems earlier with this chip and new ALSA,
but thought maybe this is helpful. The kernel is booted with pci=noacpi
due to recent problems with nforce2 mb's using -mm series kernels.
It worked flawlessly in 2.6.1-rc1-mm1.
