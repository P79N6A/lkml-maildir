You can make "pseudo-hard" links by having the same offset pointer into
the data area: the hard links won't share the same inode, but they WILL
share all of the actual file contents, which is usually all you care about
if you want to create a small rescue disk or boot rom filesystem.
mkcramfs isn't clever enough to notice this yet, though.
