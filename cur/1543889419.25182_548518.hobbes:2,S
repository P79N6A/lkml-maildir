Hi Pierre,
I saw a mail thread about you working on SDIO support in existing MMC
stack in Linux, I was wondering whether you have some updates (patches)
on this.
As we have a plan to develop the SDIO layer and use the existing MMC
stack (for memory portion of combo cards and memory only cards). 
Can you please send your updates; we will follow whats there and take it
further if required.
Thanks
