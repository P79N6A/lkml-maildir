Hello,
trying to use the bonding functionality with a DFE-580TX quad port board,
I discovered I had to change the sundance.c driver to write the station
address with word access; that's actually what the sundance technology st201
and the ic+ IP100 data sheets say, so that should be ok in the general
case.
