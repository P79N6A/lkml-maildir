Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.21: Increase dynamic proc slots to 8192 from 4096
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This fixes problems I was seeing while trying to create a large number
of vlan interfaces (each interface has a proc file entry).
I hear it's even larger in 2.5.X, so if anyone wants to double it again,
please feel free!
