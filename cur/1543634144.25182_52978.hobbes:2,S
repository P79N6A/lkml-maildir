This is the NUMA "I want to be in this group" problem.  If you're
serious about this, you'll go for a sys_sched_groupaffinity call, or
add an extra arg to sys_sched_setaffinity, or simply use the top 16
bits of the cpu arg.
You will also add /proc/cpugroups or something to export this
information to users so there's a point.
Sorry, the current interface is insufficient for NUMA *and* is
impossible[1] for the user to use correctly.
