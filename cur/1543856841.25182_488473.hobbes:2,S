The HW knows which TCP connections are offloaded by virtue of the fact
that they were setup via the RDMA subsystem.  Any other TCP traffic (and
all other non TCP traffic) gets passed to the host stack.

It is possible, but not very interesting.
One could implement an all-software iWARP stack.  The iWARP protocols
are just TCP payload and _could_ be implemented in user mode on top of a
socket.  However, this isn't very interesting:  the goal of iWARP (and
RDMA for that matter) is to allow direct placement of data into user
memory with 0 copies done by the host CPU.  low latency.
