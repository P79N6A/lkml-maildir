The stock kernel shows a local-apic interrupt rate of 18Hz (HZ=250).  Other
times I've seen 13Hz.
With this patch series applied, disabling the local apic in config fixes
things up (using the PIT).
With the stock kernel and SMP, the system is slow, but not _as_ slow. 
Bootup takes maybe twice as long, but not all week.  This time the local
APIC interrupt rate is 8Hz, so something peculiar is happening here -
nothing is proportional.
It'd be nice to fix the local apic rather than working around it.  Any idea
why it's doing this?
