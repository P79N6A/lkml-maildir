What incompatible tools???
Any nfs-utils that work with vanilla 2.2.16 will work just fine with
patched 2.2.16.  They may not access any new functionality, but there
ARE NO INCOMPATIBILITIES (that I know of, and I am quute close to the
game).
Note that this is in contrast to the changes that went into 2.2.14,
which DID break compatability - all of a sudden you needed to run
lockd from user space, where as before you didn't. (with the patches
you don't any more, so they actaully improve compatability).
