That takes care of bisectability, but doesn't take care of the problem
of new stuff being merged which used the old API and is now broken.
Maybe the last step (removal of old API) needs to be taken a lot later
than it currently is (maybe a second merge window between -rc1 and -rc2
for removal of interfaces that became unused during the first merge
window before -rc1?)
