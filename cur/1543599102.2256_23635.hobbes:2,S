Well there are three causes for this generally
1.	Video cards pulling stupid pranks to get good benchmark results
2.	Chipsets that don't give the ISA bus any useful share of bandwidth
	during AGP or PCI traffic
3.	The console locks
#3 is fixed in -ac
#2 isnt generally fixable but some bioses let you alter the fairness/pci
	rules
#1 normally only appears in X11
