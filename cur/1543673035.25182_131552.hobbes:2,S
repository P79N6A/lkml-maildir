Hi!
> This should be fixed now.  We had a bad disk on kernel.bkbits.net.
It does not quite work:
delme2$ rsync -zav --delete
rsync.kernel.org::pub/scm/linux/kernel/bkcvs/linux-2.5 .
MOTD:
MOTD:   Welcome to the Linux Kernel Archive.
...
MOTD:   U.S. regulations.
MOTD:
receiving file list ... done
client: nothing to do: perhaps you need to specify some filenames or
the --recursive option?
rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at
main.c(636)
delme2$
Should I use another mirror?
