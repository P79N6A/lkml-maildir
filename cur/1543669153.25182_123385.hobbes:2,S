Hello,
Below is the backtrace of a USB oops which has has been freezing my system
since around 2.5.65 and which I've only just spotted. I have a monitor with
built-in USB hub. When the monitor is turned off, the USB hub disconnects from
its upstream hub and when the monitor is turned on again, the hub reconnects.
I can't tell if the oops happens on disconnect or reconnect though. I don't
have a serial cable atm, but I hope the information is sufficient. If not,
please let me know. Or you can send me a patch to try out.
Regards,
-Udo.
