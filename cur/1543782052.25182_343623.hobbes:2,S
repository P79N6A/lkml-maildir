Possibly, the posix timer code is rather convoluted in this area so I'm
not entirely sure my analysis is correct.

Well, the reason is because they wanted lockless pre-alloc.  If you do
it locked, you can't use GFP_KERNEL for the memory allocation flag which
rather defeats its purpose.
Perhaps the bug is in the API.  We have pre-allocate, new, find and
remove.  Perhaps what we're missing is a reuse all of which could then
rely on caller provided locking, with pre-alloc and remove requiring
user context but new, find and reuse being happy in irq context.
