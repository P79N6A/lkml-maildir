The thing is, this array never gets filled with correct values for XAPICs in
case when we go through ACPI, not MP.
I only care about it because that is how I used to distinguish Cascades from
Fosters on ES7000 (which I need to do very early, before I get to APIC mode
setup).
On the other hand, I just noticed that I could go with smp_num_siblings for
this purpose... so if this issue is too shady as of now, i will survive, I
guess...:)

Ugh.
It's indexed by the apic ID, not the cpu id. They're not 1-1.
