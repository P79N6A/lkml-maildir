The BIOS does polling only for its internal tasks. It doesn't generate
events when readouts change unless something important happened. So if
you want readouts you need to poll the SMBIOS or hardware, like on the
Zaurus.

We also need to decide on clear convention about units. Are they in
the output and/or filename? Filename is best, I think, since it's
impossible to miss and works nicely for input attributes too.

Changed since last poll? That doesn't work with multiple clients.
Changed for the last X seconds? That requires everybody to poll that
frequenty, and risks missing events due to system load.
Wild thought: how about adding a generic "event source" mechanism into
sysfs, at the same level as attributes? Maybe even make them textual,
in keeping with sysfs philosophy:
while read TYPE PARAM  < /sys/class/battery/BAT0/criticl_events; do
  echo "battery 0 generated ctitical event $TYPE with parameters $PARAM"
done
The simpler solution is to convert events into state (e.g.,
critical=0/1) and present them as normal attributes which userspace
can poll, as Greg KH suggested (did I get that right?). I'm not sure
it's always easy, e.g., does ACPI genereate an explicit
no-longer-critical event?

I can't think of a realistic scenario where it's a problem. The latest
readout is always the best one to look at.

So where does that go in the /dev scheme?
