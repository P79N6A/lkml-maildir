Yuck. I'll not mess with that one, then. But it probably needs a comment:
Tidy up sched.h a bit.
(1) ->personality has a "???" comment sitting above it. Comment it.
(2) a comment referring to the nonexistent field ->father from before
	the pidhash merge persists. Remove the comment. The replacements
	are all already commented.
(3) ->did_exec, ->leader, and ->keep_capabilities are all boolean, and
	may fit into the same word. Also comment them.
(4) used_math is used by assembly, leave it alone, but comment that.
