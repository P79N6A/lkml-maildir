Andrew,

I used modprobe 3c59x options=8 debug=7, as recommended by you (or maybe
Bogdan) on the vortex mailing list. This was after I had tried it without
the options argument.

Nope, it is connected to a Linksys BEFSR41 4-port 100Mbps router, and my
desktop connects at full-duplex to the same router.

As I stated above, I tried the special options only after I was not able to
connect without them.

Tried this, it did not help.

How would I do this?

I am able to connect successfully with a 3Com Cardbus card to the same
router , using the same cable.

This would be my last effort, but I am afraid it might be my only option. At
this point, the link light never comes on, and I am afraid that I might have
installed the card incorrectly. OTOH, there seem to be several unresolved
bug reports regarding this card on the vortex mailing list, where the card
works correctly with Windows but not under Linux. Do we know of people using
this card (the 3C556B version, not the vanilla 3C556) successfully?
Thanks for your help, and please let me know if you need any other
information.
