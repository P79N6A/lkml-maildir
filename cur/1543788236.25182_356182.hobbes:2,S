Subject: [PATCH/RFC 0/2] simple SPI controller on PXA2xx SSP port
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following this will be two reposted patches (with whitespace correctly
preserved), releasing an initial "SPI controller" implementation running
on David Brownell's "simple SPI framework" and a prototype "SPI
protocol" driver for the Cirrus Logic CS8415A S/PDIF decoder chip.  The
controller should run on any PXA2xx SSP port and has been tested on the
PXA255 NSSP port.  Complete board setup and description facilities per
the SPI framework are supported.
Your comments and suggestions encouraged!  You can e-mail me directly if
you have any question regarding running SPI controller on your board.
Thank you David for helping me make this real!
