Currently, as you can only choose one of them, it should be obvious.
With your 'you can choose n number of options' patch, it becomes
confusing why there is a generic option at all.

Sure, but that still doesn't prevent it being used on any system as
a generic kernel.

the 3.3.2 and 3.4 branches have it.

Adding in stuff like cpu specific memory copy routines for example.
There have been several cases where vendors haven't been able to squeeze a
boot kernel onto a CD by 40 or so bytes in the past, leading to a last
minute scavenge to try and reclaim that space. Every little helps.

I'm arguing for errata workarounds, not extended support.
