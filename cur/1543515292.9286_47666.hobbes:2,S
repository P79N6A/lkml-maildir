Hi,
Sorry for my delayed reply.  That was dumb of me not to check for followups.

If we do that, how can the VM still exert pressure to get rid of dirty
pages?

A "DirtyBit" in the page would give the VM the option of notifying file
systems that have big caches to get rid of pages; now the count is
irrelevant.  Is that what shmfs does?

Great I agree: a file system generic pointer would help a lot. Can we have
