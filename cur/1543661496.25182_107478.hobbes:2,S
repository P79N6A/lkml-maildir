I may have missed this in the archives, if so just ignore this.
2.4.20 UP experiences a lockup on any access to /dev.  Not sure what
triggers it, I'll watch more carefully tomorrow night.
Symtoms are: every process trying to open/readdir /dev blocks on disk
forever.  Processes already using devices continue to work.  System
rapidly accumulates defunct processes, but ALT-SYSREQ-* works to
umount/sync/reboot.
The only thing unusual about this system is that it's compiled for K6
and it's now running on a P2.  If it's determined to be because of
the CPU upgrade, it probably is wanting a printk("WARNING! Incompatable
Processor detected!")
None of my other 2.4.20 boxes have this happen, but they also don't
handle quite the volume of mail this one does.
