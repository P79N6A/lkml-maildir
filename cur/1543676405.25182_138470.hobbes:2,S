I don't mind it, but it doesn't buy much.
It's actually in some other cases where I think there is a readability 
issue, ie in more complex conditionals I personally prefer the simpler 
cersion, ie I much prefer something like
	if (ptr && ptr->ops && ptr->ops->shutdown)
		ptr->ops->shutdown(ptr, xxxx);
over the pointless NULL-masturbation in something like
	if (ptr != NULL && ptr->ops != NULL && ptr->ops->shutdown != NULL)
		ptr->ops->shutdown(ptr, xxxx)
which I just is much less readable than the simple version.
