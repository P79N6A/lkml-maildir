Greg,
There was some code added to warn if pci_get_subsys() is called and the 
pci_devices is empty.
I'm wondering if there is some point at which we know its ok for the 
pci_devices list be empty if there are no devices on the bus so we can 
stop printing the message.
On an embedded PPC reference system I see this message 6 times when I've 
got no cards in the PCI slots.
