We'd like to keep state in the driver in order to be able to control
both outgoing and incoming traffic.  I'm not sure this check will
become a performance problem, but anyone with who can measure it is
welcome to speak up.  I suspect that optimizing this now would be a
case of premature optimization.

Thanks.  That looks like the only place our packet handler is called.

Thanks.

These errors haven't happened much, but if they did, I'd want
everybody to know.  Would you suggest a per-device counter to limit
how many times this message gets printed?

Hmm.  It's just a macro for kfree_skb, but I thought that
dev_kfree_skb is the more correct one for us to call.  I mean, if
dev_kfree_skb isn't supposed to be called here, then what's it for?
