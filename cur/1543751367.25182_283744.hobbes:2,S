No where in DRM is page_table_lock being taken.  Also, no other device
driver takes page_table_lock either, so that probably implies that DRM
shouldn't start doing it to. Best solution would probably be add an mm
function for get_user_phys() that takes the lock internally. If you
add the function I'll convert DRM to use it.
