This change actually breaks USB altogether on an Asus P4P800, as I noticed when I updated to 2.6.8-rc1.
I get the following messages at boot:
-----
Jul 12 23:34:06 willdesktop kernel: ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: BIOS handoff failed (104, 1010001)
Jul 12 23:34:06 willdesktop kernel: ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: can't reset
Jul 12 23:34:06 willdesktop kernel: ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: init 0000:00:1d.7 fail, -95
Jul 12 23:34:06 willdesktop kernel: ehci_hcd: probe of 0000:00:1d.7 failed with error -95

I've seen a few other people with this problem, and reversing the change makes everything work perfectly again, maybe this was the cause of it all?  (sorry if I missed the fix before)
(included patch reverses it)
