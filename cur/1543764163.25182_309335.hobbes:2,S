Not necessarily.  As long as the windows remain mutually exclusive in
the rbtree, it doesn't matter too much if we occasionally allocate a
full one --- as long as that case is rare, the worst that happens is
that we fail to allocate from the window and have to repeat the window
reserve.
The difficulty will be in keeping it rare.  What we need to avoid is the
case where multiple tasks need a new window, they all drop the lock,
find the same bits free in the bitmap, then all try to take that
window.  One will succeed, the others will fail; but as the files in
that bit of the disk continue to grow, we risk those processes
*continually* repeating the same stomp-on-each-others'-windows operation
and raising the allocation overhead significantly.

Possible, but not necessarily nice.  If you've got a nearly-full disk,
most bits will be already allocated.  As you scan the bitmaps, it may
take quite a while to find a free bit; do you really want to (a) lock
the whole block group with a temporary window just to do the scan, or
(b) keep allocating multiple smaller windows until you finally find a
free bit?  The former is bad for concurrency if you have multiple tasks
trying to allocate nearby on disk --- you'll force them into different
block groups.  The latter is high overhead.
