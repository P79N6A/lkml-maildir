Both patches add a global function key_init, resulting in the following 
compile error:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
security/built-in.o(.init.text+0x80): In function `key_init':
: multiple definition of `key_init'
fs/built-in.o(.text+0x8e200): first defined here
ld: Warning: size of symbol `key_init' changed from 90 in fs/built-in.o to 247 in security/built-in.o
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
I'm unsure about the key management code case, but for reiser4 this name 
is definitely too generic for a global symbol (-> reiser4_key_init ?).
