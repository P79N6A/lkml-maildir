You could do it once and then store in quilt (or git/hg if you prefer that) 
for further editing as patchkits. That will simplify review and merging.

If you always add a new add_timer with timeout jiffies+1 it will always run in this

Such a hunk just shouldn't be a hidden in a huge patch. Individual patches please.

flags are cheap. Just add three if you need them.
