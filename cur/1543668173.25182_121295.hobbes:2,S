Intentional? No.
Documented? I suppose you can find complaints from others
mentioning the same thing.
Cause? eth discovery order is not well-defined.
Once or twice I have submitted patches to rectify.
They help for a while and then someone breaks things again.
I am not quite sure, apologies in case I misremember, but
maybe the most recent breakage was caused by Marc Zyngier
with EISA bus changes.
Google turns up
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0301.2/1139.html
Let me add the patch referred to there. Maybe Jeff likes it this time.
