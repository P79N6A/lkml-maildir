if you want not virtualize anything, what is this discussion about? :)
can you provide an URL to your sources? you makes lot's of statements 
about that your network virtualization solution is better/more complete, 
so I'd like to see your solution in whole rather than only words.
Probably this will help.

again, source would help to understand your solution and problem you 
solved and not solved yet.

These soltuions are in kernel implementations actually.
