  I would say "that is an understatement"...
  For several good reasons there has been an attempt at renumbering
  vger into an alternate address space.   That project, however, did
  yield massive amounts of DNS lookups failing in a way which did
  yield "NO ERROR" status, but also no data at all.
  Moving vger back to old address failed partially too, and it took
  serious gymnastics to sort things out again.
  The situation motivating for such drastic operation of renumbering
  is that some systems consider it right and proper to reject email
  just because DNS lookup does timeout somehow on them (no attempt
  of yielding 400-series error codes).
  Some people (a LOT of people) seem to think that it is right and proper
  to analyze the parameter value given to the EHLO/HELO greeting verb.
  ISP's know that they just can't do that, world is full broken MUAs
  (for some reason, usually at M$ systems) which are trying to submit
  email via ISP hubs..   Spam-spewers usually do get that part correctly.
  Some people seem to think that it is proper to even imagine of analyzing
  that the SMTP client's IP address has working DNS reverser entry.
  (Combine that with a failure to handle timeouts..)
