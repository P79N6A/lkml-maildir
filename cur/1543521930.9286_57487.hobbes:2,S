This text describes what happens on your system - the serious lack of free
memory.  Are the messages printed continuously or has stop after a time?

I'm usually able to log in through the serial console in out-of-memory
situations when the kernel kills enough processes.
Probably in your case the kernel hasn't killed the source of memory
consumption.
In any case you should significantly increase your /proc/sys/vm/freepages
numbers.
