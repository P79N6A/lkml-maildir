And in this case, the upper layers will silently drop write errors on
current kernels.
Cisco's Linux iSCSI driver has a configurable timeout, defaulting to
'infinite', btw.

Hrrmm. The potential to lose data by surprise here is not terribly
appealing. It might be better to add an accounting mechanism to say
"never go above x dirty pages against block device n" or something of
the sort but you can still get into trouble if you happen to have
hundreds of iSCSI devices each with their own request queue..
