Interesting.  Thanks.
One _could_ make the first readahead page non-READA, and then
make the rest READA.  That way, all block-contiguous requests
will be merged, and any non-contiguous requests will be dropped on
the floor if the request queue is full.  Which is probably what
we want to happen anyway.
Of course the alternative is to slot a little bmap() call into
the readhead logic :)

Extensivelytest is my middle name.
