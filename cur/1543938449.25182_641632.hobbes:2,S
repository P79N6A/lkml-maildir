it should be very easy for you to prove me wrong then. I've got a very 
simple question: please tell me, how do i run a binary compiled for an 
iBCS2 platform under Linux v2.6.23?
I've got plenty of v2.6.23-running testsystems, tell me, if i wanted, 
how could i run any iBCS2 binary on them? All i see is a massive, 
2.4-kernels-only patchkit:
   
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hch/linux-abi/v2.4/
which external patch-kit was not picked up by major distros and which 
was never integrated into the upstream kernel either. iBCS2 support in 
Linux 2.6 simply does not exist.
