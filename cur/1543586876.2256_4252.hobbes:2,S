hi!
i get a lot of messages of this kind:
Apr  6 17:44:33 home kernel: eth0: RTL8139 Interrupt line blocked, status 4.
Apr  6 17:44:33 home kernel: eth0: SMP simultaneous entry of an interrupt handler.
linux 2.2.19
dual pentium 166
rtl8139
high network load (encrypted x applications over network)
with a low load i don't get the messages.
everything seems to work fine. are these interrupt problems "bad" or merely
indicators of a high load. can/should one get rid of them?
MfG,
	Armin Obersteiner
