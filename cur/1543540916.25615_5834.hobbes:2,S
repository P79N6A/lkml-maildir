Hmmm, I guess we need to filter those bad IE commands too ;-)
Seriously, this check reminds me of the old days when VMS had a hard limit to
the amount of memory one process could have. We database implementers
thought this was a bug. Ultimately DEC agreed and removed the limit. Funny
thing, NT, when it came out years later, had the same silly limit and we
database implementors still thought it was a bug. And even MS fixed it
finally.
This kind of hard coded limit done for "the users protection" is really
patronizing: "We know better than you where you want to go today".
If as OS implementors, we cannot anticipate every use of a system, we at
least should not prohibit some uses arbitrarily.
Sorry for the rant ...

Shut up, be happy.  The conveniences you demanded are now mandatory.
