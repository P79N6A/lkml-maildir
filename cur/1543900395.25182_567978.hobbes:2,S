You made a connection which wasn't there - setserial v3 doesn't allow
this either, but it is a cleaner and slightly more extensible
implementation of setserial v2.
It does, however, drop support for the things which 2.6 kernels don't
support, such as the setting of the multiport addresses and masks.  So
it wouldn't be suitable for shipping as-is with (eg) 2.4 kernels.
