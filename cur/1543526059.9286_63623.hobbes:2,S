That would need a bit of kernel work on the bridge code for header space
copying but not a lot

Its a case of 'which'

Intel are being a pain, promise things, deny them, promise them again, blame
someone else. I've spent a while going around the loop with them on this and
the EEPro100+ server. I'm bored of it. I don't expect Intel DSL cards to
ever be supported. A guy I know is working with one of the other vendors
boards and except for a small issue to be worked out may have a GPL driver
eventually
USB DSL is likely to come along at some point. There are also hopefully going
to be DSL devices from 3com who at least historically have been very
Linux friendly.

If you are a DSL provider and would like some tools to determine if NAT
or masquerading is being used I can quote you a price 8). Seriously its
not very hard to spot.
