That is a completely separate issue since NT4 software raid also exists but 
doesn't use dynamic disks at all. The existing md driver in Linux can be 
modified to make this work. No need for a full rewrite. There are problems 
with it at the moment which make it not work for ntfs software raid but 
they can be solved. It's just not on anyones high priority list at the 
moment...
