hi
Does anyone know how to patch up 2.5 with the ide patch to allow for
Promise ATA133 support?
As previously reported (in "Error reading multiple large files"), I have
SERIOUS problems with 2.4 - problems I haven't managed to work around, so
I thought I might as well try 2.5 to see if the same problem's there as
well.
