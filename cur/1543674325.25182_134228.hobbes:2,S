Concerns have been expressed that the /proc interface may be a bit racy. 
One thing we do need to do is to write a /proc stresstest tool which pokes
numbers into the /proc files at high rates, run that under traffic for a
few hours.
There is no need to pull out the existing balancer until the userspace
solution is proven - it can be turned off with `noirqbalance' until that
work has been performed.
Nobody has tried improving the current balancer.  From a quick look it
appears that it could work reasonably for the problematic packet-forwarding
workload if the when-to-start-balancing threshold is reduced from 1000/sec
to (say) 10/sec.  Don't know - I've never seen a description of how the
algorithm should be improved.
