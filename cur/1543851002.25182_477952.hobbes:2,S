I mean page cache limiting is not needed. We need to make
sure group eats less that N physical pages. That can be
achieved by controlling page faults, setup_arg_pages(), etc.
Page cache is not to be touched.

We do not account for page cache itself. We track only
physical pages regardless of where they are.

Of course! Otherwise what do we need kmem_cache_alloc_node() etc
calls in kernel?
The second question is - what if two processes from different
beancounters try to share one page. I remember that the current
solution is to take the page from the first user's reserve. OK.
Consider then that this first user stops using the page. When
this happens one page must be put back to it's reserve, right?
But where to get this page from?
Note that making guarantee through limiting doesn't care about
where the page is get from.
