Thanks.  The patch boots, and...  doesn't solve the bug.  Weird.
CPU bug?  I've upgraded the BIOS not such a long time ago.
I guess now we know what the problem is, it would be pretty easy to
create some test code, that uses two threads, one of which loops in
lock/unlock/rep_nop and the other that tries to acquire the lock and
measures latency.
Should I try to do that?
Thanks,
Miklos
