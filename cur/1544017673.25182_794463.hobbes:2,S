Ingo,
it looks like e39ad415ac15116df213dfa2aa2a4f1b0857af9c should have
been reverted together with 7503bfbae89eba07b46441a5d1594647f6b8ab7d.
In general, perhaps all "set_cpus_allowed_ptr() -> work_on_cpu()"
conversions - if they involve any cpu-hotplug callback paths - may
lead to similar reports (and possible lockups).
