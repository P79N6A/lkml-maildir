I think the big difference is that you can't *get* an IA64 chip
without the NDA (or even with it, AFAIK).  If IA64 was available
*today* as a retail item then it would be a *very* different issue.
Note also that most of the people working on IA64 for Linux seems to
be at companies where one can reasonably expect it to be part of their
job, which again changes things quite substantially.
