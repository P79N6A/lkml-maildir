What you really want is the Linux-embedded mailing list. See
  
http://waste.org/mail/linux-embedded
4MB is doable, but 8MB+ is probably better for anything being released
today.
The trickiest part with an SBC is booting and the trickiest part of
booting is configuring your chipset (and the EX in this case) properly.
Have you properly enabled the serial port, for instance?  To debug this
sort of stuff, I wrote a small polled serial library in assembly.
To get started, you might also try booting DOS if you can, and then using
loadlin.exe to start Linux, which gets around some boot loader issues.
