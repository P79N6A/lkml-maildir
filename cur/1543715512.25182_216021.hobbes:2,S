Trying these against 2.6.5 + ia64 patch, with efibootmgr-0.5.2-test2.
Works: reading, deleting values.
Doesn't work:  creating and editing values
I note that efibootmgr prints out a warning when it can't read
nonexistant variables, like BootNext.  I'll remove that warning.
It's likely a bug in efibootmgr, as this is the first time I've tried
the sysfs side of things.  If you're in a position to help debug, I'd
appreciate it.
Thanks,
Matt
