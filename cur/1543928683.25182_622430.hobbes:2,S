Exactly because kernel messages are in general _not_ sentences.
IMO trailing periods

Well, for one it needlessly increases the size of log files.
It also IMO just looks weird to have a trailing period only for some 
messages and it certainly is completely inappropriate for messages like:
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
[...]
ACPI: RSDP 000FE020, 0014 (r0 INTEL )
ACPI: RSDT 7F6FDE48, 0058 (r1 INTEL  D945GCZ       FF9 MSFT  1000013)
If I look at my current dmesg output, *only* 16 out of 543 line have a 
trailing period, and in almost all cases they just looks out of place. See 
some examples at the bottom of this mail.

Exactly why I make an exception for those in my proposal.

I feel that to improve consistency the CodingStyle should be clear about 
when a period should and should not be used.
Some examples of IMO unneeded/inconsistent use of trailing periods:
Entering add_active_range(0, 521983, 521984) 3 entries of 3200 used
end_pfn_map = 521984
DMI 2.3 present.

ACPI: IRQ2 used by override.
ACPI: IRQ9 used by override.

PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing

The last example shows the inconsistency very well. And in this case the 
second line could easily be "reduced" to a regular message by using a 
semicolon instead of a period between the "sentences".
This is already being done in a number of other messages, for example:
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
So I'd suggest to change those last three lines to (including some textual 
improvements):
PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing
PCI: If a device doesn't work, try "pci=routeirq"; if that helps, please 
post a report
PCI-GART: No AMD northbridge found
