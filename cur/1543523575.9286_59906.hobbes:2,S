What version are you comparing it to?

There's a kernel patch which creates an "autofs4" filesystem rather than
replacing the existing autofs filesystem.  The autofs 4.0.0 daemon tries
mounting a filesystem of type "autofs4" before "autofs", in case autofs is
still the v3 version.  Unfortunately, if you don't have an autofs4 filesystem,
it will print a complaint from trying to find an autofs4 module before going on
to use the autofs filesystem.

I'll look into these.
