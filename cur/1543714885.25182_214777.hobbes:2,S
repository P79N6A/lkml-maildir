Subject: [2.6 patch] remove the STANDALONE dependency on EXPERIMENTAL

Is there a good reason why STANDALONE depends on EXPERIMENTAL?
I disabled EXPERIMENTAL and was no longer able to enable STANDALONE.
Unless there's a good reason, I'd suggest the following patch:
--- linux-2.6.5-mm6-full/init/Kconfig.old	2004-04-16 20:27:07.000000000 +0200
+++ linux-2.6.5-mm6-full/init/Kconfig	2004-04-16 20:27:17.000000000 +0200
