I think it's great! Now, the world will know what Penguin power
is all about. When I was killing babies in Vietnam, we didn't have
the authority to turn anything as powerful as the Penguin loose.
In fact, Penguin-Power didn't exist yet, and you were still pissing
the bed. But now, just let them babies come stomping across the
desert, the mighty Penguin, the mother-of-all-operating-systems,
will whack their butts into the stone-age.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
