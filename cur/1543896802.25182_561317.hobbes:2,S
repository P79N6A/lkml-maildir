Well, thanks.
I'll have a look at these, perhaps I can figure out which patches are needed
to fix them (if there are any).  Also, please add my address to the CC lists
of any new hibernation/suspend-related bug reports, so that I'm aware of them.
FYI, I've started to cherry pick patches related to suspend and hibernation
that I think are relevant for each -rc kernel (at
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/
).  [However, I don't
backport patches because of the lack of time, so when the next -rc is out, I
rediff the patchset against this one and don't add new patches for the previous
kernels any more.]
There also is the Hibernation/Suspend subcategory in "Power Management" in
the kernel bugizlla.  Please ask your users to file bug reports in there if
that helps.
Also, all of the currently tracked (with the bugzilla) problems related to
hibernation and suspend are linked to this entry:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7216
Greetings,
Rafael
