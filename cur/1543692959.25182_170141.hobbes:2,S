To clarify, the patch is a forward port from test5 of patches already submitted.
The files patched are:
# arch/i386/kernel/mca.c
# drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c
# drivers/pci/pci.c
# drivers/serial/8250.c
# drivers/serial/serial_core.c
# fs/devfs/base.c
# fs/inode.c
# fs/locks.c
# fs/super.c
# include/linux/list.h
# include/linux/skbuff.h
# kernel/kmod.c
# mm/slab.c
# net/core/dev.c
# sound/oss/via82cxxx_audio.c
The patch squelches build errors in the kernel-doc make targets by adding
documentation to arguements previously not documented, and updating the argument
names where they have changed.
Cheers,
Mikal
