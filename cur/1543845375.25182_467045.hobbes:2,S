I believe that we are way too far into the task-teardown process for
something like synchronize_rcu() to be feasible (not enough of the
task left to be able to sleep!), but thought I should bring up the
possibility on the off-chance that it caused someone to come up with a
better approach.
Another possible approach would be workqueues.  The disadvantages here are
(1) higher overhead (2) workqueues can be delayed for a -long- time in a
realtime environment, which increases vulnerability to memory exhaustion.
Again, hoping this provokes some better ideas...
