and similar code in p6 and p4 watchdog_reset.
- Why are you reading the perfctrs with RDMSR instead of RDPMC?
  RDMSR is noticeably slower on most post-P5 CPUs.
- "(low & (1 << 31)) == 0" looks like a convoluted and inefficient
  way of computing "(int)low >= 0".
- The p6 and k7 watchdog_reset procedures are identicial, except
  for the actual MSR number used. The original nmi.c makes the
  number a parameter and shares the code, causing less code bloat.
