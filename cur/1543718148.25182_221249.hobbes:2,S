Bartlomiej,
	I am running Gentoo and there is not an ebuild for the Vanilla kernel
for 2.6. I know I can still build it but since you said that I had
everything configured correctly I got to thinking. I had remembered a
"feature" to rebuild the kernel cleanly, mrproper, so I gave it a shot.
I did a make mrproper and rebuilt the kernel as normal. Now the nforce2
chipset is detected on boot and DMA is on! 
Thank you so much for your time and the help you have given me. :)
Kindest regards,
Mike
