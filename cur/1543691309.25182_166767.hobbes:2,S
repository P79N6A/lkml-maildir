[PCMCIA] Fix race condition causing cards to be incorrectly recognised
This patch that went into test5 causes my Toshiba laptop with Xircom 
pcmcia nic to freeze on boot at "Socket status: 30000020".  
test4 didn't have this issue, and test5-mm2 is the same as test5 vanilla.
If the Xircom nic is inserted after boot then everything works without a 
problem.
Backing out this patch restores normal boot.   Any tips on how i can 
narrow the problem down further would be appreciated.   lspci and
.config attached.
TIA,
Sean
