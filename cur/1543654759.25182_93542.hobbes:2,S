Well, the official gateway linux.dev.kernel was closed a long time ago
because it was seen as the Sole Reason For Spam On Linux-Kernel.  IIRC
it didn't change the spam volumes significantly, and really just
resulted in more gateways and more mail loops, but...
I also don't really think I have the energy to restart everything I
once set up, although I guess you never know.  For now, though, too
many other things to do...
