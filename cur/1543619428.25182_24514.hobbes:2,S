I doubt that is ever a good idea.  The kernel would have to track which
gcc was being used and work out what to override or duplicate.  Why
make the kernel any more sensitive to gcc than we have to?

--nostdinc is the default for kbuild 2.5.  I did not bother sending it
in for 2.4 because my kbuild 2.5 testing finds the naughty code anyway
and I send individual bug fixes for the offending files.  There is also
a risk of breaking existing third party code, I was not willing to take
that risk on a "stable" series like 2.4.
