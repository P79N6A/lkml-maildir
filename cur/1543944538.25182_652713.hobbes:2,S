Ted's description matches mine (keep quilt tree in git, edit changelog
entries, rebase on newer kernel versions, etc.)  I can go into details
if needed.

I was amazed at how slow stgit was when I tried it out.  I use
git-quiltimport a lot and I don't think it's any slower than just using
quilt on its own.  So I think that the speed issue should be the same.
I had a number of issues last time I tried stgit out, but maybe they are
now resolved, I'll try it out tomorrow and report to the git list
anything I find that doesn't work for me.
