Posix has a new posix_fadvise function for this, and Unix mmap()s
usually support madvise() for the same functionality.

We already do the background readaheads.  The trouble is, even knowing
the expected access pattern, you have no idea how fast the application
is going to request the data, how many other demands on system memory
are going to be made in the mean time and so on.  The current behaviour,
which detects sequential reads automatically and which expands the
readahead buffer to 100 or 200k dynamically, works well and doesn't
result in a huge amount of wasted IO or memory.
