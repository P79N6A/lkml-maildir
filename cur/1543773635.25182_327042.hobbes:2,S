Subject: [PATCH] kdump documentation update to introduce use of irqpoll
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Following is a patch to update kdump documentation.
Thanks
Vivek
o Specify "irqpoll" command line option which loading second kernel. This
  helps in reducing driver initialization failures in second kernel due
  to shared interrupts.
o Enabled LAPIC/IOAPIC support for UP kernels in second kernel. This reduces
  the chances of devices sharing the irq and hence reduces the chances of
  driver initialization failures in second kernel.
o Build a UP capture kernel and disabled SMP support.
