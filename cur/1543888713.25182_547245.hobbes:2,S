I think we're talking past each other.  I addressed many of the points

That's there, see the patches.

Also covered.

This is an implementation detail.  I can understand not wanting to run a 
huge X server for this purpose, but I've already said that it can be done 
with far less code for environments with different needs.
> 4) OOPS should always display even if in a graphics mode
This is definitely a goal, and something I spelled out in my initial post.  
I think we'll need a new KD_* type to cover this case (i.e. not KD_TEXT 
but not quite KD_GRAPHICS either).  This should be fairly straightforward 
once I have some good user level apps running on top of these interfaces.

This is more of a console issue, not really a graphics design issue I 
think.

Again, called out in my initial post.  Yes, the kernel should save/restore 
state by itself and not rely on some userspace application.  However, we 
don't want to break the VT switch API either, so we'll still likely need a 
heavyweight save/restore state mechanism somewhere.

A userspace console using these interfaces could do this, it's not really a 
kernel graphics problem.

This is already done.

I don't see what this has to do with the overall design, it's a driver 
problem (well aside from polluting the generic interfaces with VGA 
knowledge, which I'm not planning on doing).
> 10) Support things like cloning and output device selection.
Already done.
Again, *please* take a look at the description in my initial post and the 
patches themselves (or the modesetting-101 branch in the drm tree).  I 
think that'll lead to a more concrete discussion about what's 
missing/needed, etc.
Thanks,
Jesse
