That's not what gcc does.
Gcc silently just doesn't inline it. 
And the error message you get is 
	ld: undefined function 'serial_paranoia_check'
which is not exactly helpful.
That, together with the fact that gcc's notion of "large" is completely
undefined (for a while, it had absolutely nothing to do with size, but
with what kinds of things the function did, like having the address of a
label taken) means that it's basically not useful for what you suggest
anyway..
