I wonder if any vendors, or independent groups, would be interested in 
maintaining a POSIX compliancy patchkit for the Linux kernel?
IMO such a "POSIX Linux" project would be useful for several reasons. 
 Overall, I think there is pressure from several directions to get all 
sorts of POSIX APIs into the kernel.  On occasion, kernel hackers are 
confronted with a situation where complete POSIX compliancy may mean a 
compromise in some area, be it performance, security, API issues, code 
cleanliness issues, etc.  Or simply that the POSIX-related code just 
isn't ready to be merged into the mainline kernel yet.
The vendors also benefit by this, because the barrier to entry in 
POSIX-related cases would be lowered, which would in turn satisfy the 
demands of customers.  Which would in turn give the mainline kernel all 
the software engineering benefits that come from a more reasoned and 
gradual review and merge of new features.
Does something like this already exist?  This would need to be an open, 
vendor-neutral project...
