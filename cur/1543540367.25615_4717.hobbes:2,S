Correct for what?
I think this is silly.
There are two versions of header files people tend to be interested in:
a. The ones corresponding to the libc version their linker will link  
against. This will be good for 99% of the situations.
b. A special version for some kernel-version-dependant executable. Exact  
version depends on what they plan to do with that executable - could be  
most advanced kernel version available, least advanced version available,  
a specific version whose significance depends on the configuration of a  
different machine, whatever.
There is no reason to assume that the currently running kernel version is  
any more relevant than any of the other arguments for b.
