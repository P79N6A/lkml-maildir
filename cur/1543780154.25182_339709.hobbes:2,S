Hi,
when trying out smaps I have encountered the following problem:
> cat /proc/$P/smaps | diff - /proc/$P/smaps
239,241c239,241
< bfbaf000-bfbc4000 rw-p bfbaf000 00:00 0          [stack]
< Size:                84 kB
< Rss:                 24 kB

Further investigation shows that diff reads /proc/$P/smaps in 1 kB blocks as 
do cat if stdout is a terminal. But if stdout is a pipe cat reads the file in 
128 kB blocks.
The culprit is probably fs/proc/task_mmu.c:m_start(). I think it doesn't 
properly convert the current file position.
Reading in blocks up to 3700 bytes yields the correct result. Higher block 
sizes are wrong.
Is that a known problem?
