Ok. I agree, #2 is also a configuration language item.
(actual CML doesn't support #2).
It seems that actual language support #2:
you see that every symbol have a list of dependencies,
so a configuration tools can change these dependencies.
But also CML2 don't support #2 for strange/complex rules (<1%).
(It complains about unmet dependencies.) and we should
not support it for such rules (i.e. if a rules conflicts
with PCI or other rules that force BIG changes...).
