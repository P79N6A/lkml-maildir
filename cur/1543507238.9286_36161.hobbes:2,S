There's another way too. (used ikd salesman:)  If you want to know what
led up to any event that you know where it's happening, you can enable
ktracer and insert SUSPEND_MCOUNT at the failure point.  This will stop
further tracing.  From there, it's just a matter of working backward
through the ktrace output.
