I will look closer but I do believe that from the ioapic to the cpu the 2.6.21
code should be fairly robust with respect to inflight messages from the ioapic
to the local apics and the cpus.  What I failed to consider were inflight
messages in the other direction arriving out of order.
Part of the problem in the general case is the only way you can tell an inflight
message was transmitted is that a message that you can prove followed the first
message arrives somewhere.
I'm in the middle of tracking two other problems so I can't review this in
detail until later today at the earliest.
