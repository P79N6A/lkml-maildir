I accidently skipped one line when the kernel panics:
Right after the lines
Jan 11 17:57:43 localhost kernel: ata1: dev 0 configured for UDMA/133
Jan 11 17:57:43 localhost kernel: scsi0 : ata_piix
it is also said:
ata2: SATA port has no device.
scsi1 : ata_piix
[...]
So it doesn't seem to find any devices on the second SATA port.
Maybe that is important, too.

Hm, I don't have a serial port on my other machine.
