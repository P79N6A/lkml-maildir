Whew.  Nothing to do with quickack.  That just gave the server side of
the connection more opportunity to fill the pipe faster.  It's still a
bad sign that the client's receive queue is empty even though we see the
packets going by with tcpdump.
Can you go back down the tree until you find one which will not stall
for you?  Another idea would be to turn off SMP if you'd had it on in
the kernels you used for the tests.  These timing-related thing are
notoriously hard to debug.
