Read the COPYING file more closely, and realize that "the Program" has

It used to include it just by virtue of having the COPYING file *itself* 
be included (and that's v2), but since some people felt that was unclear, 
the COPYING file has this language pretty visibly at the top:
 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

Not for the kernel. Exactly because the kernel _does_ specify the version. 
So the sequence you quoted is a non-issue.
In other words: any file that does not *explicitly* say that it's "v2 or 
later" is v2 only.
