To be precise, it tries to sync after it has frozen the user land.

In the long run, I agree.
Still, can you please read this post from Alan Stern:
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2007-June/012847.html
?  I don't think I'm able to repeat the arguments given in there in a
convincing way.

Yeah, I think we can move the syncing before the freezing, so to speak.
And it need not be called from within the freezer, BTW.

Yes. :-)
