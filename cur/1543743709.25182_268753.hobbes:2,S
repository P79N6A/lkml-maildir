Well, since for_each_cpu() is defined like this:
#define for_each_cpu(cpu)         for_each_cpu_mask((cpu), cpu_possible_map)
We could do:
cpus_andnot(new_cpu_map, cpu_possible_map, cpu_present_map);
cpu = first_cpu(new_cpu_map);
Or maybe even:
unsigned int cpu_add(void)
{
	unsigned int cpu = NR_CPUS;
	lock_cpu_hotplug();
	if (num_present_cpus() == num_possible_cpus())
		goto out;
	cpus_andnot(new_cpu_map, cpu_possible_map, cpu_present_map);
	for_each_cpu_mask(new_cpu_map)
		if (!register_cpu(cpu)) {
			cpu_set(cpu, cpu_present_map);
			goto out;
		}
	cpu = NR_CPUS;
out:
	unlock_cpu_hotplug();
	return cpu;
}
since we want to try all possible but !present CPUs until we exhaust
them all or find one to bring online.
Simply complimenting the cpu_present_map could easily return CPUs which
aren't 'present' and aren't even 'possible' since cpu_possible_map
doesn't necessarily equal 0xFFFFFFFF (or however many FF's for your
particular platform! ;)
And FWIW, I like where you're going with this, Nathan.  I wrote a lot of
the original system topology code for sysfs, most of which is thankfully
gone now! ;)  I had hoped to clean up some of the ickier stuff, but
haven't gotten around to it.
