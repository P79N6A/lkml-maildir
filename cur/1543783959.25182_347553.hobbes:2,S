_OH_!!! Forgive me for missing the point entirely!  I can see how  
that would
work very well.  Nice trick, BTW!  Very sneaky, needs significant  
explanatory
comments in whatever header file it ends up in lest others get  
confused in
the same fashion as I.  With all of that mess out of the way, I'll  
work on
getting a few initial RFC patches out the door, and then we can  
revisit this
discussion once there is something tangible to talk about.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett

Somone asked me why I work on this free (

)
software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because
life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I  
draw
cartoons. It's my life."
