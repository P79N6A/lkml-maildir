This is virt_to_page() on i386: the object address is in %esi
     lea    0x40000000(%esi),%eax
     mov    0x0,%edx [0x0 is actually mem_map]
     shr    $0xc,%eax
     shl    $0x5,%eax
Just read the mem_map pointer and a few calculations.
And now retrieve the cachep pointer:
    mov    0x18(%eax,%edx,1),%edx
With NUMA on i386 (GENERIC_ARCH)
    lea    0x40000000(%edi),%eax
    mov    %eax,%ebx
    shr    $0x1c,%eax
    movsbl 0x0(%eax),%eax [ 0x0 is physnode_map]
    shr    $0xc,%ebx
    mov    0x0(,%eax,4),%ecx [0x0 is node_data]
    mov    %ebx,%eax
    mov    0xaa0(%ecx),%edx
    sub    %edx,%eax
    mov    0xa98(%ecx),%edx
    shl    $0x5,%eax
4 memory accesses.
    mov    0x18(%eax,%edx,1),%ebp
