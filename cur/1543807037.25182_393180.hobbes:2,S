Yes, it is some concept of abstract container. I will send a series of 
patches for this today CCing you, so that you could take a look and 
better understand what and how it cab be used for in our opinion.

OpenVZ conception is that a VPS is something like a container, with 
virtualized TCP/IP, netfilters, rounting, IPC, process tree and so on.
It looks almost exactly like a standalone system. This container is easy 
to checkpoint and restore since it has obvious boundaries and is isolated.
Feel free to ask any questions on the forum or directly from me.
