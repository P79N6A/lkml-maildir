Yes. That's what Sys-V init does. The signal 9 should have caused the
children to have their fd's closed. This does not happen for sockets.
The SIGTERM (15) can be trapped. SIGKILL (9) can't, but it doesn't get
sent to pid 1 (init) so init doesn't get killed.

Correct. I need them to be closed during the shutdown. There should
be some way so I don't have to insert a signal handler into software
I don't have the source for.
