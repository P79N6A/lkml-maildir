Where does it add overhead? It's just the interface between the reiser4
storage layer and the rest abstracted out.
Ok, there's the code that dispatches the VFS method calls to the plugin
call but I would say that's about it. I didn't develop reiser4 so I
don't know.
/* ->mkdir() VFS method in reiser4 inode_operations */
static int
reiser4_mkdir(struct inode *parent      /* inode of parent
                                         * directory */ ,
              struct dentry *dentry     /* dentry of new object to
                                         * create */ ,
              int mode /* new object's mode */ )
{
        reiser4_object_create_data data;
        reiser4_stat_inc_at(parent->i_sb, vfs_calls.mkdir);
        data.mode = S_IFDIR | mode;
        data.id = DIRECTORY_FILE_PLUGIN_ID;
        return invoke_create_method(parent, dentry, &data);
}
The invoke_create_method then just calls the create method of the plugin
after setting up a context and lookup up the plugin.
xfs_iops.c seems to do something similar.

Well, I think so. It's done relatively often.

I don't know, ask Hans. How could the VFS know it a filesystem wants to
do something specific with a file that is completely transparent to the
VFS?
