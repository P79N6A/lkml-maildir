I saw that e1000e commit from Jeff's tree and was about to push
back on him.  But I decided not to.
I will next time if it's such a big deal, but frankly I thought this
one was OK.  It's stupid to make people wait until 2.6.27 to be able
to use the e1000e cards with the new PHY type.  It causes some hw bug
workaround to need to be added to the e1000e driver, and that's where
the bulk of that 800 line change is from.
Distributions are going to add that e1000e PHY support patch anyways,
regardless of what we do, and isn't that one of the reasons we were
talking about more aggressively merging new drivers?
Who the heck are we kidding if we don't put changes like that into the
tree when pretty much every distribution will?  Yes, even after rc1.
