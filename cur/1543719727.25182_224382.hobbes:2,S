While booting linux-2.4.27-pre1 the system hangs.  If I put a 20 second 
delay in at the lilo prompt then the system always boot successfully.  
...I just pulled 20 seconds out of the air... less time might work,  but 
I haven't tried.  I've also tried linux-2.4.24 with the same results.
I've since updated the system and raid card to the most current bios. 
and it hasn't helped.  The old raid bios was build 6082.
The system hangs right before the "Red Hat/Apaptec..." line below.
