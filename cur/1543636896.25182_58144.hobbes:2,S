we abstracted simple types such as pte_t, pmd_t and pgd_t for one good
reason: it's 3 *distinct* entities that can be confused quite easily,
causing subtle VM bugs (eg. for quite some time the x86 arch had 2-level
paging only, so to have a proper 3-level paging VM we needed these type
checks).
i dont sense the same type of urge (and danger of mixup) wrt. the
interrupt flags.
