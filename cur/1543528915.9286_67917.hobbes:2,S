The Cisco router I am testing with sends keepalives with the multicast
and other traffic with the unicast. I don't know for sure that other
router models follow the same convention.
Part of the problem seems to be that different Cisco models behave
differently with respect to the address. Some accept multicast for
any traffic, and some only accept unicast for normal traffic.
