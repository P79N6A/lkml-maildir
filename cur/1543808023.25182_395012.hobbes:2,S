There are some questions I have while looking at this HOWTO,
which I think should be answered there:

Does it need to be mounted (so it possibly gets filled and thereby unusable),
or can it be a mkswapped partition?
Can it even be a swap-file? Probably not, unless you want to resume by
ro-nojournalreplay-mounting the corresponding partition.
How big does it have to be, compared to the RAM? As big + n? Bigger? BIGGER?
