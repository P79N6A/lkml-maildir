Thinkpad T61p .. I've seen a few of these.
Firstly try the card and adapter in a different PC and let me know if
that works. So far they do. If that is the case get the latest firmware
updates (BIOS etc) for your thinkpad and see if the problem goes away.
They (or our ACPI code I guess it may be) have some serious IRQ routing
problems on this box.
