I never knew of any problems that didn't affect linux clients too (and 
I did most of the NFS patches) If you know any please let me know.

It is not inherent to journaling file systems, linux software raid  5
can always corrupt your data when you have a system crash with a disk
crash (no way to write stripe sets atomically and half writen strip sets
usually give random data for any crashed block in it when xored against parity) 
Given that 2.4 should be safe.
In this case "safe" just means that you don't need a fsck to be sure that
the metadata is consistent -- data is never guaranteed to be consistent 
unless you have applications that use fsync/O_SYNC properly (=basically do 
their own journaling) 
So overall I would not be worried too much, it isn't much worse with a 
journaled fs than it is without it.
