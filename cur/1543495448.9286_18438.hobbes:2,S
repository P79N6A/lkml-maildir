Subject: 2.2.8/2.3.0 failed compile with ethertap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Error on link:
  drivers/net/net.a(ethertap.o): In function `ethertap_start_xmit':
  ethertap.o(.text+0xce): undefined reference to `__skb_push'
  make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
Using the drivers/net/ethertap.c from 2.2.7 compiled OK (untested as
of yet).  I'm not sure why 'skb_push' was changed to '__skb_push'.
I don't see anything in 2.3.1pre1 that would fix this.
The differences in that file between 2.2.7 and 2.3.0 follow.
