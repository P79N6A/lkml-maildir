OK I have replaced enough of the libs so that
rpm works again, and was able to do a verify
to get the rest of the pieces in order.

I was able to recover some stuff from old
backups, including the kernels I last used
under RH 7.1 -
I see vmlinuz-2.4.12-ac6, and vmlinuz-2.4.13
Both have preempt patches, and highmen
& smp support.
I know they were stable under the test.
I am pounding the old 2.4.13 kernel now
(filesystems mounted as ext2) with dbench
16, 32, 64, and 128 and it is holding up fine.
I will compile 2.4.14 without the preempt
patch and repeat -
Finally, I will repeat the 2.4.14+preempt
test, and I predict the box  will lock hard
a few seconds after typing "dbench 16"
Is there anything in particular you would
like me to try?
