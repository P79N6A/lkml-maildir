Nope.  Odd, eh?
Only log item of relevance was

which I get every now and then anyhow.

2.4 survived this fine.  Looking like its not the disk, then.  I will
try this in 2.5 once I backup some data and finish some work.
I should note I have been running this machine with 2.5 for about a
month now with no problems and my development machines have been 2.5
since, uh, 2.5.1 but they are all IDE not SCSI.
