Right, the same problem as using floating point in the kernel (mmx uses
the FP regs and they are not saved).  The question is: Just how long do
these routines take?  If it is very long it may be best to just say no. 
One way would be to always pretend that the "in_interrupt" flag is set. 
I think possibly some routines are short and the switch off/ switch on
pair is right, but for the long ones, well the preemption patch is
supposed to make the kernel more preemptable, not less.  Any one have
execution times for these functions?
