I once wrote a Windows 95/98 VXD that used the Microsoft mechanism - 
frequently called a 'hooker'.  In that case, you took a VXD template and made 
a system call that 'hooked' onto either a device or a filename.  In windows, 
each file I/O action generated an event.  You could listen for the event and 
then check to see if it was for your file or device, and if so, choose to 
selectively service (i.e, do the right thing), or pass it on to the normal 
driver, or a combination of both.  While at the time I thought "wow, what a 
cool way wreak havoc", it was the only way at the time to get around some 
other MS multimedia limitations.   If someone wants it, I'll be glad to dig 
it out.
