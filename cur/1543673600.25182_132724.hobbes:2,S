Jens can give the more complete answer on enforcement, and also correct
any mis-statements I made.
Base on the queue values below the aic7xxx driver should see the
following characteristics on IO. The IO should be for no more than 8k
made up of no more than 128 sg entries with no segment crossing the
seg_boundary_mask.

scsi_alloc_queue: queue for aic7xxx
