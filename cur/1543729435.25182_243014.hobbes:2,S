Of course, cdrecord won't work this way... Anyway, I tried cdrecord and
growisofs with your patch and got some more blocked commands:
This happens with a cd in a plextor cd writer  PX-W5224:
zassenhaus [10:32] fst 105) cdrecord -dao dev=ATAPI:/dev/hdd test.img
...
Supported modes:
cdrecord: Drive does not support SAO recording.
cdrecord: Illegal write mode for this drive.

Aug 18 10:29:38 zassenhaus kernel: SCSI-CMD Filter: 0x55 not allowed with read-mode
Without a cd in the drive, it gives some more commands:
...
Device seems to be: Generic mmc CD-RW.
cdrecord: Operation not permitted. prevent/allow medium removal: scsi sendcmd: no error
CDB:  1E 00 00 00 00 00

cmd finished after 0.000s timeout 200s
Using generic SCSI-3/mmc   CD-R/CD-RW driver (mmc_cdr).
Driver flags   : MMC-3 SWABAUDIO BURNFREE
Supported modes:
cdrecord: Drive does not support SAO recording.
cdrecord: Illegal write mode for this drive.

When calling the same command on a NEC ND1300A dvd writer, 0xe9 and 0xed
do not occur, the rest is identical.
"growisofs -Z /dev/hdd=test.img" on the NEC fails with
":-( unable to READ FORMAT CAPACITIES: Operation not permitted"
Aug 18 10:45:37 aiken kernel: SCSI-CMD Filter: 0x23 not allowed with read-mode
I will try to add all of those because we need to allow users to write
CDs at the moment, but I have no clue what is safe and unsafe here :-/
cu,
Frank
