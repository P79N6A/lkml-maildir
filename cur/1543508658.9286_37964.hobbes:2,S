After we went over it I happen to think Linus was right to reject it. Knfsd
is less clear - the old knfsd has problems, it is a bug fix. Im reluctant
to do it for 2.2.13 because with the stuff in the test 2.2.13pre5 it looks
like a bit of settling time for the fixes then it will be ready. 
Adding knfsd is going to add a -big- chunk of testing/fallout time.
