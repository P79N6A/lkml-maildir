Excuse me? I've never heard of that program.
0 pc-sw8:acahalan$ base64encode
bash: base64encode: command not found
127 pc-sw8:acahalan$ 
This is the latest Debian unstable. I get the same on Tru64,
Solaris, and my Red Hat system. Only uuencode is everywhere.
The rest of the MIME tools are generally absent or buggy too.
The last time I had to deal with MIME, I had to forward the
email to a Windows box. Not even mutt would tolerate it.
(that would be the latest debian-unstable mutt)
The only alternative to uuencode would be a png-logo.c or
png-logo.pl that spits out a png file without external help.
