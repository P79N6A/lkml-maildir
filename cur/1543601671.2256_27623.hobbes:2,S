this is with 2.4.9-ac12 non preempt and without the patch on an athlon 850 
k7-2 . niced to -20.  It was compiled with gcc 3.0.2  no CFLAGS

Using optimizations with this code actually slows it down for me.  perhaps 
this means something.  When using asm code, perhaps it's better to not use 
any compiler flags in the kernel config.  The patch is still needed of course 
to stop user programs from crashing the system, but maybe in the kernel for 
asm sources you shouldn't try any compiler flags and see if that increases 
performance.  this could all be a gcc 3.x'ism though.
