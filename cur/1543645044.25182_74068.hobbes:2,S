    I have a server available to test it, but the storage in question is 
already deployed. Yet, by luck (irony apart) i have a maintenance window 
this weekend for tuning and other matters, i can decrease the maximum 
number of TCQ commands per device in the proper aic7xxx driver to 32 and 
  report on the results. While trying to solve this problem i browsed 
RedHat's bugzilla, and there were several people burned with this 
problem. Hope this sorts it out for them.
