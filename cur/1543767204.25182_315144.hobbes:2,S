I am working on soft-timer subsystem rework that will do exactly this,
based upon John Stultz's timeofday-rework. Expect to see an RFC soon

Perhaps not discussed before, but definitely a known issue. Check out
sys_nanosleep(), which adds an extra jiffy to the delay if there is
going to be one. My patch, which uses human-time (or at least more so
than currently), should not have issues like this.

Your patch is the only way to guarantee no early timeouts, as far as I know.
Really, what you want is:
on adding timers, take the ceiling of the interval into which it could be added
on expiring timers, take the floor
This combination guarantees no timers go off early (and takes away
many of these corner cases). I do exactly this in my patch, btw.
