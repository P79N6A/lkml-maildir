I though about that, but what about corner cases where only a single
register can be accessed ? (typically alt status). Provide specific
routines ? Also, how does the extended addressing works ? by writing
several times to the cyl registers ? That would have to be dealt with
as well in each host driver then.

Right. We could go the darwin (apple) way and have taskfile_load/store
functions doing the entire registers controlled by a bitmask of which
registers has to be touched. it has a cost (testing each bit and
conditionally branching, which can suck hard) but probably less than
an indirect function call which isn't predictable.
