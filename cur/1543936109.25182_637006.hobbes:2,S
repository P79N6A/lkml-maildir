Here's what I think is a better patch.  Or maybe just simpler.
However, I'm still unsure what the effect of this patch on
file descriptor passing might be.  Reading the prior code,
and the parallel portions/comments in unix_dgram_recvmsg(),
it looks like there's been a lot of uncertainty as to how
file descriptor passing should be handled durning MSG_PEEK
operations.  To quote:
	/* It is questionable: on PEEK we could:
	   - do not return fds - good, but too simple 8)
	   - return fds, and do not return them on read (old strategy,
	     apparently wrong)
	   - clone fds (I chose it for now, it is the most universal
	     solution)
	   POSIX 1003.1g does not actually define this clearly
	   at all. POSIX 1003.1g doesn't define a lot of things
	   clearly however!
	*/
With this patch, passed file descriptors are ignored during MSG_PEEK.
This is essentially the first case in the comment above.  What I
can't seem to figure out is why this is incorrect.  I suspect there's
some history here that I can't find via Google, mailing list archives,
or revision logs.
So, that said, here's a cleaner patch.  It's still not ready for
application until the file descriptor passing is better understood.
Thanks,
Brent
