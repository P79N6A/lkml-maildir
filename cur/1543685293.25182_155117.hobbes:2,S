Subject: Cardbus suspend/resume of 3ccfe575bt card fails

Hi akpm,
Yes, I should've reported this sooner.
2.4 and 2.6 kernels exhibit the same problem - upon resume, the card
indicates that it has a 10base link to the hub, but the hub indicates
it has a 100base link.  No traffic is possible.
Unplugging and replugging the card restores the link correctly (100base).
The following is from 2.6.0-test2:
0000:05:00.0: 3Com PCI 3CCFE575BT Cyclone CardBus at 0x1800. Vers LK1.1.19
Before suspend, mii-diag reports:
Basic registers of MII PHY #0:  3000 282d 0300 e54b 00a1 45e1 0001 0000.
 The autonegotiated capability is 00a0.
The autonegotiated media type is 100baseTx.
 Basic mode control register 0x3000: Auto-negotiation enabled.
 You have link beat, and everything is working OK.
 Your link partner advertised 45e1: Flow-control 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx 10baseT-FD 10baseT, w/ 802.3X flow control.
   End of basic transceiver information.
After resume, it reports:
Basic registers of MII PHY #0:  ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff.
  No MII transceiver present!.
I suspect this may be caused by the device not being restored correctly:
05:00.0 Class 0200: 10b7:5157 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: 10b7:5b57

It looks like 3c59x only saves the PCI config space and restores it if
you have WOL enabled - this is obviously wrong if you're suspending/
resuming a CardBus device.
