Yes, every PPC distribution maker I talked to liked it, and I guess the 
benefits are even higher for distributions supporting multiple platforms.

I wholeheartedly agree. Initially I entered this whole "input game" cause I 
wanted to get rid of "I ruined my keyboard layout with tool xyz" reports on 
PPC (not to talk about the "big USB disaster" in early 2.2) and took a look 
at the "Linux keycodes" approach in usb/keybdev.c. But it soon appeared to 
me that it would be just plain silly _not_ to use possibilities provided by 
the input drivers.
- it factors out a lot of code (eg. it obsoletes adbmouse.c on PPC, 
replaced with 5 lines of code)
- it's convenient for driver developers
- it's convenient for users (eg. one unified mouse protocol)
- it's very lightweight
