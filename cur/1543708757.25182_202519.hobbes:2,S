So far, it looks like the vm_vfs_scan_ratio setting of '3' (instead of
'6' which was the default) made a big difference.
Currently the machine is using about ~600MB for cache (up from ~100MB),
and about 150MB for buffers (up from 80-100MB).
I'm going to let it run a little longer just with this setting, before
experimenting further.
I'll ask around about the perceived performance of the machine, and pay
attention to it myself.  I'll post the results monday or tuesday (not a
lot of interactive users during the weekend  ;)
Again, thanks a lot for the quick feedback!
