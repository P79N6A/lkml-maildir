I tend to agree with this.  Having fallocate() fill up the filesystem
is exactly what the caller asked.  Doing a write() hit ENOSPC doesn't
trucate off the whole write either, nor does "dd" delete the whole file
when the filesystem is full.
Even checking the statfs() space before doing the fallocate() may be
counter intuitive, since it will return ENOSPC but the filesystem will
not actually be full.  Some applications (e.g. database) may WANT to
fill the filesystem and then get the actual file size back to avoid
trusting statfs() because of metadata overhead (e.g. indirect blocks).
One of the design goals for sys_fallocate() was to allow FA_DELALLOC
to deallocate unwritten extents in a safe manner.
Cheers, Andreas
