Please note that there are two structs there: One of them is tagged /* 
core */ and another
of them is tagged as beeing /* disk */. The driver does only touch the 
core version, which is
supposedly only to be used by the driver itself. This is what I was 
complaining about in first
place: Why is the driver's internal struct exposed there at all
All right?
