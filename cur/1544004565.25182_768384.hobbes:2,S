so..  what's wrong with using that (possibly with some
generalisation/enhancement)?
btw, mem_cgroup_force_empty_list() uses PageLRU() outside ->lru_lock. 
That's racy, although afaict this race will only cause an accounting
error.
Or maybe not.  What happens if
__mem_cgroup_uncharge_common()->__mem_cgroup_remove_list() is passed a
page which isn't on an LRU any more?  boom?
