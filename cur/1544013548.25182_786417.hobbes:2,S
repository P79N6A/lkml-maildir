Eh, why ever care? We aren't passing NULL pointers in, hopefully, or the
code was crashing, at least before the conversion... So as long as we're
careful adding new users, I don't see a problem with not handling NULL.
FWIW, I'd think for MAC addresses there are multiple possible
interpretations, some wireless code assumes broadcast for NULL, and I'm
sure there are others like all-zeroes.
