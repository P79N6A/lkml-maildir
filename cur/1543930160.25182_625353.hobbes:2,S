It looks like it is WORKFLOW A (with the fact that each ',' is file
save stated explicitely rather than implicitely).

Why not use versioning filesystem for that, for example ext3cow
(which looks suprisingly git-like, when you take into account that
for ext3cow history is linear and centralized, so one can use date
or sequential number to name commits).
See GitLinks page on Git Wiki, "Other links" section:
  
http://www.ext3cow.com/
Version control system is all about WORKFLOW B, where programmer
controls when it is time to commit (and in private repository he/she
can then rewrite history to arrive at "Perfect patch series"[*1*]);
something that for example CVS failed at, requiring programmer to do
a merge if upstream has any changes when trying to commit.
[*1*] I have lost link to post at LKML about rewriting history to
      arrive at perfect patch _series_. IIRC I have found it first
      time on this mailing list. I would be grateful for sending this
      link if you have it. TIA.
