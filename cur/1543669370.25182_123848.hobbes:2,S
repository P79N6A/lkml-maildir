  Because hashes  1) change at slightest text changes,  2)  are quite 
  meaningless when a message gets some inserted material, like 
  numbers in them.
  In the big-iron era the messages had 32 ot 64 bit numeric identities
  (or 36 bit in such machines), and were allocated number-spaced by
  each subsystem/product.  E.g.  Assembler had codes 3AFB-**** thru
  3AFF-****,  etc.
  VMS has a bit different style, but how it does exactly do it, I don't
  recall for sure.   %Subsysid-severity-msgid   (or something like that.)
  Presently Linux kernel has just the <severity> code.  Mostly subsysid
  is "kernel", although that could be divided further, so that msgid does
  not need to carry that info, e.g. "kernel-crit-ext3fs_inode_corruption_7"
  instead: "ext3fs-crit-inode_corruption_7"  (or alike).
  The amount of text is .. considerable .. in that kind of styles.
  With:
    printk(msgidcode, KERN_CRIT "mumblemumble", params)
  produced load-time footprint is reduced somewhat.
  Could that come out as:
     <6-MSGID-CODE> mumblemumble...
  Perhaps.  (16+16 bits hex coded should be quite sufficient.
  If some kernel subsystem has over 64 000 messages, things
  are quite bad...)
  Folks at IBM do know how to do things like this.
  Mind you, this WILL NOT help something like  klogd  to translate
  received messages into language XYZ,  merely help administrator
  to find further explanations.
