I don't get it.  What do you mean by "increase the security"?
If your security relies on unpredictability, then with a non-cryptographic
PRNG, you have no security.  What am I missing?
I'm just not seeing how frandom is going to make your life any better
here.  In almost every security system I've ever looked at, either you
need a full-strength crypto PRNG, or else a simple counter is enough.

I am always suspicious of warm-n-fuzzy arguments, when it comes to
security.  Either it is security-critical, or it isn't.  And, if you
don't know whether or not it is security-critical, look out!
If the most compelling argument we can come up with for putting
frandom in the kernel is warm-n-fuzzies...  well, I think we can all
draw some conclusions from that.
