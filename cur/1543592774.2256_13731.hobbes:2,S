	Good standard don't mandate the implementation. And as
somebody doing some other language said, there is more than one way to
do it.
	ANSI C doesn't prohibit to initialise variable to zero
(AFAIK). ANSI C doesn't prevent the compiler to optimise for this
case. If I initialise the varaible 3 time to the same value in a row,
gcc will remove the other two.
	Let's put it another way... What's different between :
		for(i = 0; i < n; i++) xxx;
	And :
		i = 0; while(i++ < n) xxx;
	I would expect the compiler to produce code as efficient in
both cases, and leave the choice of coding style to the user.
