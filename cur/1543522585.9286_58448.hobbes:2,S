Subject: SCSI timeout errors betwwen 2940U2W and Chaparral RAID

    Hi,
    I've got an x86 host with an AHA-2940U2W running Redhat 6.1, 2.2.12, and
was wondering if anyone else out there is having trouble getting this kernel
(or 2.2.13) to talk Ultra2 to other SCSI devices. Basically what I'm getting
are timeouts during the AIC7xxx device detection phase, which resolve, and then
I get repeated ext2fs filesystem corruption problems on the disk. This machine
is connected to a Chaparral RAID array of nine 36GB disks, and is partitioned
into fourteen 20GB or so partitions.  I've also tried just about every
termination setting possible on the SCSI controller BIOS, and know that the
chain is physically terminated on each end properly. So, what I'm wondering is:
   o Will a 20GB filesystem freak ext2fs out? I've never build such a large 
ext2fs filesystem before, though I've never had problems with large filesystem 
support on Sun UFS or SGI xfs before.
   o Is there a known problem with negotiating Ultra2 on the AHA2940U2W and 
the standard AIX7xxx.c driver which ships with Redhat's 2.2.12?
   o The array has a bridge adapter sitting on LUN 1 of ID 1, but I've tried 
turning off multiple LUN support for that ID as well as for the boot ID, just 
to make certain that this wasn't confusing the AIX7xxx driver.  Didn't help 
either way, however.
Here's relevant dmesg output:
