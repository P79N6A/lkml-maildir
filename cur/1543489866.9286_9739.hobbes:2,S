Umm.. 
It's not that the inode cache uses bad allocators.
It's the fact that inodes have very difficult lifetime behaviour (some
very short-lived, some _extremely_ long-lived), and that makes it hard to
allocate them well using _any_ allocator scheme.
It might certainly be an option to allocate inodes in bigger chunks at a
time. That would at least make the problem become less.
