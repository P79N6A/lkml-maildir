Well, I don't see what's so bad with EXT2_IOC_GETVERSION?  It's not like
many Linux filesystems have inode generation numbers in the first place.
It may even be that reiserfs does/would implement the EXT2_IOC_GETVERSION
ioctl also (they implemented EXT2_IOC_GETATTR compatible with ext2/ext3).
You can wrap this inside glibc if you really want to, and that has the
added benefit of working with all kernels in existence.  That's not to
say this ioctl is the best interface...

IIRC, there are several other desirable changes to struct stat/stat64
(64-bit timestamps, 32-bit UIDs/GIDs, and others I believe, some searching
should show up complaintants) so if there is really a need to add yet
_another_ stat struct/syscall we may as well do it right _this_ time
(like we've said every other time we change this interface).
Cheers, Andreas
