Is this expected ?
$ cd /usr/local/src/kernel/linux-2.6.16
$ make O=/home/fredlwm/objdir/ oldconfig
...
make -C /usr/local/src/kernel/linux-2.6.16 O=/home/fredlwm/objdir .kernelrelease
Makefile:480: .config: No such file or directory
.config is in /home/fredlwm/objdir
.kernelrelease gets created in 
/usr/local/src/kernel/linux-2.6.16 . I thought nothing would be 
written to the sources directory. What if I were on a read-only 
filesystem ?
I didn't try to build it. Are these harmless ?
