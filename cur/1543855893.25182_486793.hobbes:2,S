Ok, I see that we are already doing it :(. So we can end up in a
deadlock.
Here's the culprit callpath:
_cpu_down()
!
!-> raw_notifier_call_chain(CPU_LOCK_ACQUIRE)
!	!
!	!-> workqueue_cpu_mutex(CPU_LOCK_ACQUIRE) [*]
!
!-> raw_notifier_call_chain(CPU_DEAD)
	!
	!-> cpufreq_cpu_callback (CPU_DEAD)
		!
		!-> cpufreq_remove_dev
			!
			!-> __cpufreq_governor(data, GOVERNOR_STOP)
				!
				!-> policy->governor->governor()
					!
					!-> cpufreq_governor_dbs(GOVERNOR_STOP)
						!
						!-> destroy_workqueue() [*]
[*] indicates function takes workqueue_mutex.
So a deadlock!
I wasn't able to observe this because I'm running Xeon SMP box on which
you cannot offline cpu0. And cpufreq data is created only for cpu0,
while all other cpus cpufreq_data just point to cpu0's cpufreq_data.
So the mentioned callpath within  cpufreq_remove_dev is never reached
during the normal cpu offline cycle.
However, if there are architectures which allow the first-booted-cpu
(or to be precise, the cpu for which cpufreq_data is *actually* created) 
to be offlined and we are running Ondemand governor during the offline,
we will see this deadlock.
