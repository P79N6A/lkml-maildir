For those interested, I prepared a set of high resolution timers 
patches against linux-2.6.9:
<
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=20460&package_id=63076&release_id=280281>
New for this release is support for the SH architecture.  This SH
support is to be considered experimental though.  Please send
comments to the project mailing list:
<high-res-timers-discourse@lists.sourceforge.net>
This set of patches provide POSIX high resolution timer support.
For more info see the SourceForge project pages:
