I need to avoid going through the BIOS ... this is a 
multiquad NUMA machine, and it doesn't take kindly
to the reboot through the BIOS for various reasons.
It also takes about 4 minutes, which is a pain ;-)
I have source code access to our BIOS if I really wanted, 
I just want to avoid modifying it if possible.

Hmmm ... sounds interesting ... any pointers?

I was under the impression that most BIOSes reset
memory on reboot, so this was impossible during a
BIOS reboot?
