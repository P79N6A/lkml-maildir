well the driver probes the bios for that data and assigns the irq line it gets
from it.

Can you please send me your whole boot log of 2.6.25-rc2? Thanks.

since your cdrom seems to be hda from what i've seen above, try booting with
'hda=noprobe' or maybe 'hda=none' to see which one turns the probing off for
you. See Documentation/ide.txt for details.

Roughly speaking, cdrom.c is the unified cdrom layer that delivers common
functionality to all the cdrom devices. ide-cd and others are the low-level
device drivers that offer drive-specific functionality only. In case you wanna
know more about it, see Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex (might want to
convert it to something more readable) and read the section on stackable kernel
modules in Linux Device Drivers, 3 ed.
