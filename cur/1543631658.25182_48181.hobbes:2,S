Actually, most people I know think that it's the other way around:
real-time==hard-real-time and soft-real-time==marketing buzzword.

Fine by me, it's your kernel.

Ok, so you think that having hard-rt in user-space was all done for evading
the patent?
FYI, this was designed and implemented in late 1999, early 2000. At the time,
all this patent crap hadn't surfaced yet!
So please, before declaring "zero interest" for our work, at least check it
out first.

I don't see where I said this. I do care about all of those things. Heck,
the entirety of the tools I developped are GPL. I sell 0$ of closed-source
software. >>>0$<<<
In addition to those a,b,c, I actually care about the proliferation of
the Linux kernel into a field which seriously needs it. What I have
witnessed in the field is that Linux is simply not used because of the
reasons I mentionned earlier.
It evades me, why you shouldn't care about Linux's proliferation in that
field and that you so easily dismiss the real-time Linux community's
worries which I am relaying to you.

No. This is true hard-real-time. For God's sake, download RTAI and do
the measurements yourself if you don't want to take my word for it.
These hard-real-time processes are truely hard-hard-hard-realtime!!!
