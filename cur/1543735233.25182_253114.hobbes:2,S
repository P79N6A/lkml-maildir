Subject: ESP corruption bug - what CPUs are affected?

Hello.
My question is not directly linux-related,
but I think people here can give me some clue
on an issue.
There is a "semi-official" bug in Intel CPUs,
which is described here:
http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/specupdt/27287402.PDF
chapter "Specification Clarifications"
section 4: "Use Of ESP In 16-Bit Code With 32-Bit Interrupt Handlers".
A short quote:
"ISSUE: When a 32-bit IRET is used to return to another privilege level,
and the old level uses a 4G stack (D/B bit in the segment register = 1),
while the new level uses a 64k stack (D/B bit = 0), then only the 
lower word of ESP is updated."
Which means that the higher word of ESP gets
trashed. This bug beats dosemu rather badly,
but there seem to be not much info about that
bug available on the net.
What I want to find out, is what CPUs are
affected. I wrote a small test-case. It is
attached. I tried it on Intel Pentium and
on AMD Athlon - bug is present on both. But
I'd like to know if it is also present on a
Transmeta Crusoe, Cyrix and other CPUs.
Can someone please run the test-case on some
of that CPUs and see how it goes?
Note: specifying "32" as an arg to the
test-case, will make it to use the 32bit
segment for the stack, and it will not detect
the bug. It is there to prove that it detects
the Right Thing. Run it without that argument.
I'd also like to know any thoughts on whether
it is possible to work around the bug, probably
in a kernel? Well, I am not hoping on such a
possibility, but who knows...
Anyway, I'd be glad to get any info on that bug.
Why it was not fixed for so many years, looks
also like an interesting question, as for me.
