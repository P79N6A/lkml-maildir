The

yes, but if the fd is within a chroot, then there will be a ".." above
that will be a chroot point, if you go into the orig chroot w an fd,
yea, you can go up to the "orig root" (aka the real /) from that fd. 
Otherwise, you will be stopped once you hit a chroot point.
If you are in a chroot, and you can get chroot's to stack (as per I
described b4) then any fd you ever get will be locked in, as you wont be
able to use fchdir to jump out of all the chroot's and then ".." up.
