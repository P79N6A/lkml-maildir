Let's walk through the existing code:
		i = na->name_len * sizeof(ntfschar);
now, i = na->name_len * 2
		ni->name = kmalloc(i + sizeof(ntfschar), GFP_ATOMIC);
we allocated (na->name_len * 2 + 2) bytes
		if (!ni->name)
			return -ENOMEM;
		memcpy(ni->name, na->name, i);
we copied (na->name_len * 2) bytes
		ni->name[i] = 0;
here, we zero the two bytes at byte offsets ((na->name_len * 2) * 2) and
((na->name_len * 2) * 2 + 1), and that is the bug.  We _want_ to zero
the two bytes at byte offsets (na->name_len * 2) and (na->name_len * 2 + 1),
which we can do in C via
		ni->name[na->name_len] = 0;
because sizeof(*(ni->name)) == 2.
So I'm still suspecting that you mistested that change.
