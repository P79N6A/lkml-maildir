Thank you for proving that you are completely uninformed!
Smake is able to compile a _lot_ more real world applications than BSD make.
This is because smake is POSIX compliant while BSD make is not.
Smake is even able to compile more free software that depends on non-portable
GNU make extensions than Sun make does.
And smake warns about makefiles that only work because they depend on Bugs
found in Sun make or GNU make (e.g. because they try to expand '$*' or '$<'
in explicit target rules).
