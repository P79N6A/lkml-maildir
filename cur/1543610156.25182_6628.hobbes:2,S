Hi Justin,
if the aic driver in 2.4.15-pre7 aborts the initialization, it doesn't
properly clean up:
from dmesg:
> SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
> ahc_pci:0:10:0: Using left over BIOS settings
> ahc_pci:0:10:0: No SCB space found
> Trying to free free IRQ12
The reason why it aborted it probably a hardware problem - now it
reports "PCI Device 0:10.0 failed memory mapped test".
But it should not free an irq it never allocated.
