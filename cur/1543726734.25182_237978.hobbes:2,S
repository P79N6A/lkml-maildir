One minor problem: this crashes hard (in interrupt context, stack pointer is 
bogus) during early boot iff CONFIG_REGPARM is set. With the earlier patches, 
this didn't happen. No ill effects so far with the default ABI; performance 
(apart from the usual reiserfs problems) is flawless.
Context: plain 2.6.8-rc2 + O2, gcc (GCC) 3.3.4 20040623 (Gentoo Linux 
3.3.4-r1, ssp-3.3.2-2, pie-8.7.6), EPoX 8RDA3+ (nForce2) motherboard. If you 
need more information, let me know.
Ciao,
Daniel.
