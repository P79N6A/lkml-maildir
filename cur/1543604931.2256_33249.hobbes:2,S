Perhaps.  Terminal modes & speeds & special lines and so on set on the
tty side can be seen on the pty side, although I think the pty is not
notified immediately so it has to poll if it wants to detect terminal
programs sending a BREAK signal and things like that.
I had a look at this about a year ago.  I remember that a couple of
small changes to the pty/tty layer would have been very handy to improve
the quality of serial port emulation, and that might be the thing to do.
