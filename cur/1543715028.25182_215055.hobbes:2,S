    I was reading the book "Understanding the Linux
kernel", about 2.4, and the authors: 
    1)assure that there is no process switch during
the execution of an eception handler (aka syscall).
they emphasize it.
    2) say that the execption handler may not generate
exceptions, except for page faults.
     So, if process switching occurs at page faults, I
was wondering which statement is true of if I am
missing sth. 
     You mentioned page faults due to code. Aren´t the
syscall handlers located in mlocked?
Thanks again
