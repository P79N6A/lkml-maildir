I felt ashamed by the vagueness of my previous report (below), so I
did some more digging.  
Parport builtin made no difference.  (ext2 zip disk still caused a
kernel panic).  Using a vfat zip disk, the performance sucked, but
nothing died.  Using 2.2.1ac7 made no difference (didn't think it
would).  The actual message when it dies is "kernel panic: Inactive in
scsi_request_queueable In swapper task - not syncing"
Nothing makes it to the logs (but I guess it wouldn't with a panic
would it).
If you want to replicate this:
1)sync your disks (and preferably back up)
2)insmod ppa
3)make an ext2 zip disk
4)mount it
5)tar loads of stuff onto it
6)Watch your box die...
