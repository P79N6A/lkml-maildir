Ok, so some piece of code is buggy: somebody is using GFP_KERNEL instead
of GFP_ATOMIC.  Reverting my change will only hide the real bug so I
wouldn't recommend it (except for testing purposes).
Would be very nice to find the real bug.

So you mean there's a separate issue with the task selection right? I
didn't touch the task selection at all.

I didn't recall that part of your patch, but it seems very orthogonal. I
didn't want to change the process selection at the same time. If I will
touch the task selection I'll probably rewrite it from scratch to choose
tasks only in function of the allocation rate, sure not with anything
similar to the current algorithm which is close to a DoS with big
database servers if some other smaller app hits a memleak and allocates
in a loop.
