Yah, set_current_state is inlined so it would lead to a bit of code
bloat.

If I get a chance, I'll run some tests on my dual 2.5 machine and see if
they match.  But I would not let that stop anything ... this is mergable
in 2.5 imo.
One thing I notice is the patch only increments in one case:
	TASK_RUNNING -> TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
whether we ever go -> TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE from a state other than
running I am unsure.

Personally, I would not worry about this.  This is only a statistic
after all - I am more interested in whether we are properly accounting
for everything in general.  Screw weak memory consistency computers <g>
- they need to fix nr_running too, anyhow.
