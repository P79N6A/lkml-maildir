I've had this happen a few times on 2.4.20-preX, as this time I
thoguht it was time to ask what's up about it. Every once in a while
the machine will decide to not play audio, or play it at odd speeds,
after trying to play an mp3 now I got my syslog full of these:
i810_audio: DMA overrun on write
i810_audio: CIV 23, LVI 22, hwptr ba18, count -24
i810_audio: DMA overrun on write
i810_audio: CIV 23, LVI 22, hwptr bd00, count -232 
The sound init from dmesg is here:
i810: Intel ICH3 found at IO 0x4400 and 0x4000, MEM 0x0000 and 0x0000, IRQ 5
i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 6 channels.
i810_audio: Defaulting to base 2 channel mode.
i810_audio: Resetting connection 0
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: ADS99(Unknown)
i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 Unable to map surround DAC's (or DAC's not present), total channels = 2
i810_audio: setting clocking to 68246
Any pointer to why this happens?
mvh,
A
