I have been lobbying for sys_garzik(2) for years... while you're in 
there adding stuff, can you slip that in too please?

More seriously, and a bit of a tangent, I wonder how much attention we 
need to give netlink.  Because it either has the potential to be used as 
a de facto in-kernel event-passing API, or it's too heavyweight for 
that, implying [IMO] we need a netlink-lite.
I _don't_ want to see mini-netlinks springing up every time we need 
[a]sync <foo> delivery inside the kernel.
