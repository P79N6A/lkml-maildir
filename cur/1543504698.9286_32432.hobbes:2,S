Why not just make the page look like a man page, with the usual
headings and layout, but with the added advantage of hyperlinks. In a
way, that's what I suspect the info stuff is supposed to do, it's just
a pity that it is such a disgusting interface (how intuitive is using
"(* foo)" as a 'clickable' link?!).
The only disadvantage with it all being HTML (as I see it) is that you
might lose the ability to do a "man -k" type operation and get instant
search queries (unless you are going to require Apache to be running
and cgi, etc, etc).
Now that I think about it, don't the LDP folks keep man pages online?
Maybe they could be stroked into converting info pages into the same
format?
