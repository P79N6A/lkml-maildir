This thread resulted in CONFIG_HZ. You get to choose between 100, 250
or 1000. It was not meant to allow runtime HZ modifications.

Yeah, that's a tougher one :)

Does the dynamic-tick patch help you at all? I'm not sure if it's
meant to, admittedly. I'm also not sure if it has any cap on the
maximum HZ it attempts to reprogram the hardware to... Mucking with HZ
at run-time is going to break lots of stuff, though...well, not
necessarily, depends on how you muck with jiffies :)
Thanks,
