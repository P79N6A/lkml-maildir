OK, I grabbed these patches and applied them against 2.4.2-pre4 and
recompiled, rebooted.  I am now able to use reiserfs with NFS,
basic operations appear to work as expected but I haven't done large amounts
of file IO or lots of concurrent requests.  
What is the plan with regards to these patches, or ones like it, making it into
the distribution?  I noticedAlan Cox just posted the following:

which suggests that the Configure.help mis-statement is going to be corrected but
doesn't imply the fix is going in any time soon.  I think NFS over Reiser is going
to be interesting to people who are running big fileservers, so if this patch
really does fix it (without breaking anything else) then itwould make sense for it
to go in.
