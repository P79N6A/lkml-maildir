Ah, OK; I haven't communicated what we need very clearly.  We need a way
to see if the event is supported by the device, as well as a way to turn
it off.  For some of the events (possibly not the SATA AN one, since I
know all SATA devices will be well behaved) there's going to be a need
to deal with berserk or broken devices that become trigger happy, so
turning off the event will be a useful (and possibly essential) way of
coping.
