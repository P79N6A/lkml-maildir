Hi Jeff,
I found a wonderful URL of yours 
http://gtf.org/garzik/kernel/files
 full
of useful fixes for which I am grateful. However, I think the cpqarray-fix
is incorrect because (I assume) it is broken intentionally to stop people
from compiling the driver as it is currently broken. I cc'd Charles White
who is the official maintainer - can you (Charles) confirm that you are
aware your driver does not work in recent 2.3.x series or is this a new
finding and you would like more debug information to assist with fixing
it?
Regards,
