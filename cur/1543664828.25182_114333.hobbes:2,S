2003.03.04 -- cmdline-linux-2.4.20.patch
This patch provides an optional hardcoded kernel command line
along with with specifyable override behaviour
against the command line provided by the bootloader (if any)
written for arch/i386 and arch/x86_64 in linux-2.4.20
by Eric Noack (Corvus V Corax) <corvusvcorax@gemia.de>
I have seen this feature as a patch for >= 2.5.x , but missed it for
linux 2.4.x, so i just wrote it, maybe there is already one,
which I missed, so just take the better ;-)
I guess it might be useful for floppy boot, but it needs testing
at least on the x86_64 architecture, i dont have one of these yet
patch is at
http://gemia.de/test/cmdline-patch.tgz

have fun ...
