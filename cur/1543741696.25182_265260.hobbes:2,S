GNU make distingush between ":=" and "=".
An assignment made using ":=" is done immediatly.
So when make first encounter ":=" is will execute the $(wildcard ...)
function, long
before you create the localversion-bk file.
If instead "=" is used the evaluation will be deferred until you actually
dereference the variable - so here the localversion-bk fiel may well be
created.

The prepare part is more or less made to have full control on order of
the rules - so a make -j 50 goes well.
So just hooking it under prepare1 should do the trick.

Will take a look when I'm on my Linux box.
