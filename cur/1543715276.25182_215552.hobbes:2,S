It's a bit sad to add another function call level to sys_unlink() simply
because the core dumping code needs it.
Is it not possible to call sys_unlink() directly from there?  Something like
long kernel_unlink(const char *name)
{
	mm_segment_t old_fs = get_fs();
	long ret;
	set_fs(KERNEL_DS);
	ret = sys_unlink(name);
	set_fs(old_fs);
	return ret;
}
