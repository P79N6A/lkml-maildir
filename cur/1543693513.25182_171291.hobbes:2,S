Subject: [PATCH] fix SMP support in cdu535 cdrom driver

	Hi Jens,
	Patch against 2.6.0-test6.
	Even though cdu535 is polled, not interrupt driven, Matthew pointed 
out[1] that is a good idea to fix SMP support on that bit, so that 
people who wants to fix cdu31a don't get that wrong.
	Move prepare_to_wait before enable_interrupts, so that if we enter 
the interrupt handler (after enable_interrupts) on a different CPU 
that's executing sony_sleep's poll version, "wait" is already on the 
irq_wait list, which I think fixes the race that Matthew pointed out, 
doesn't it?
	CC'ing kernel-janitors since it also replaces yield for
schedule_timeout[2], as Matthew suggested.
	Please consider applying.
	Thanks,
Felipe
