Subject: [PATCH] CRED: Fix NFSD regression
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/5/301

Fix a regression in NFSD's permission checking introduced by the credentials
patches.  There are two parts to the problem, both in nfsd_setuser():
 (1) The return value of set_groups() is -ve if in error, not 0, and should be
     checked appropriately.  0 indicates success.
 (2) The UID to use for fs accesses is in new->fsuid, not new->uid (which is
     0).  This causes CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE to always be set, rather than being
     cleared if the UID is anything other than 0 after squashing.
