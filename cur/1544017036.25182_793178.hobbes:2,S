Oh, actually, I'd think not.  If the freeze was done properly by the
filesystem, all data was flushed, the fs was quiesced, and new IO was
blocked.  pdflush should never be visiting these...
In fact emergency sync is kind of orthogonal to emergency thaw, anything
which needs a thaw should never actually need a sync.
