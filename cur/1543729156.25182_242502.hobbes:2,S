Well, it did work with 2.4.26, but I agree that it's better to get the 
new stuff to work correctly. ;) I just noticed that /proc/interrupts and 
/proc/pci, lspci still disagree on the IRQ of the IDE device.

This probably has to do with this boot message:
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:11.1
I have found absolutely nothing that explains if this is an error or 
just some sort of debug message one can ignore.

Oh, thanks for noticing. Stupid me.

Ok, I've turned on the IOAPIC and it seems to work perfectly fine. 
Except for that IRQ 255 thing I've noticed no oddities. Thanks for the 
hint. :)
