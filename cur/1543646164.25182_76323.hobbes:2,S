   That looks like a kernel from a distibution.  Official linux kernels 
don't have - in their names.  You'd be best off looking on a mirror of 
your distributions web site.
PS- I'm fairly sure it's a Red Hat 7.2 errata kernel.

PPS-  Good luck find a Red Hat mirror.  Everyone and their uncle is 
downloading 8.0.
