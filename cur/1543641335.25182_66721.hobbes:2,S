Linus Torvalds 2.5.32 announcement:

I've noticed that in 2.5.32 with CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y, the kernel no
longer beeps via the PC speaker. Both (at the console) hitting DEL or BS
at the start of input or doing a simple echo ^G are now silent.
Call me old-fashioned, but I want those beeps back :-)
