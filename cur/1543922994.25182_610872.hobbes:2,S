Shouldn't this pointer be mountpoint-specific?  I mean,
if I've two cramfs images, one using zlib and another
using lzo, the two will not work at the same time.

Hmm.  How about using modular decompressor? I mean,
it isn't really necessary for a given config to handle
both lzo- and zlib-compressed cramfs images, only one
may be needed, so the other compression library becomes
a useless dependency.  This is especially important for
embedded environments where memory/disk space is limited.
Since you're using a pointer-to-function anyway, it can
be done fully dynamically, by requesting a module to de-
compress the thing at runtime.  Pretty much like it's
done f.e. in crypto/ipsec layer currently.
By the way, your patch is word-wrapped.
