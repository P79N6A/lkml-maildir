Hi Sven!
CCing to the scsi mailing list. 
Yes the gdth driver passed an open hart surgery in kernel 2.6.24. The bad thing
about it is that all three of the Coders that did that did not have any HW to work
on. One of them is me. We did cry for tester for a long time but no one came forward.
Could you test patches for us? first thing would be to enable debug output patch below.
If you absolutely need a 2.6.24 kernel, + gdth in a production system you could
checkout the 2.6.23 driver and compile. The old driver will work the same in 2.6.24.
It will not however even compile in 2.6.25-rcx.
If any one wants to send me a card that uses the gdth driver, I will be very happy
to debug this card, and return it once I'm done.
