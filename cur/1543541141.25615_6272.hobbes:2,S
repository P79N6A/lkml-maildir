Hi,
I have a server running Linux 2.2.16 with 5 SCSI U160 disks and a hot plug
backend.
I make raid5 on them. All work fine except that when hot-plugging devices
(add-singel-device, remove-single-device), the rate of the pluged disk fall
from 35Mb/sec -> 2.5Mb/sec !!! Do you have an idea why? And a workaround?
Thanks for your help
