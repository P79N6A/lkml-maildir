look at this
http://bp6.gamesquad.net/Q6fix.phtml
i have a bp6 who has the same problem whit the dual celeron, and here
is the solution for it, looks your motherboard and see if its the same
problem, the celerons are fine whit this overvolt, they are prety
stable
its abit ... it cuold be ;)

LG> just my 2 cents
