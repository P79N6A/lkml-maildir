There is absolutely no reason to use the -mm kernel anymore for low
latency audio.  The -mm kernels were never stable enough to work well
for audio users anyway.
The latest version of Ingo's realtime preempt patch is against
2.6.11-rc4.  Supposedly it applies and works with 2.6.11 vanilla, you
just have to edit the patch not to expect -rc4 as the EXTRAVERSION.
