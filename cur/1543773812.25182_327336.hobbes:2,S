Subject: scheduler cache-hot-auto-tune patch breaks ia64 UP build

Attempting to build 2.6.12-mm1 on ia64 with CONFIG_SMP disabled will
cause the build to break because max_cache_size is undefined.  I haven't
spent the time to understand the cache-hot-auto-tune feature, so I don't
have a patch to fix the problem.
