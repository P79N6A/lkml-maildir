How much will these areas of the kernel change between now and when 2.5 opens? From Alan saying that 2.4 should be out by November or so, I'd think there shouldn't be too many changes. 
I have done no real kernel work, but I'll start working through Andreis' 4 step process for migration and work on porting my changes as new kernel versions come up. If someone with more experience is interested in doing this, I'd be willing to help keep the patches up to date with the most recent kernels or help update drivers.
