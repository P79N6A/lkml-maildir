Linus, please pull from the for-linus branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git for-linus
to receive two IEEE 1394 subsystem fixes for 2.6.20-rc2.
One addresses a grossly incorrect patch of mine after 2.6.19.
(Andreas Schwab 2006-12-29, "2.6.20-rc2: kernel BUG at
include/asm/dma-mapping.h:110!")
The other fixes an old minor bug which was discovered recently.

    ieee1394: sbp2: pass REQUEST_SENSE through to the target
    
    Delete some incorrect code, left over from the initial driver submission
    in March 2001.
    
    SBP-2 targets should provide sense data via the SBP-2 status block
    (autosense).  We have to pass the REQUEST_SENSE command through to
    targets which don't implement autosense, if there are any, and to
    accomodate application clients which use this command.
