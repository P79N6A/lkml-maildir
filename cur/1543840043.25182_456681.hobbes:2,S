MD has so many benefits anyway that it doesn't make sense to use anything but 
the finest hardware RAID.
For starters, with Linux MD, you can RAID partitions on a disk independently, 
even with different RAID types, and you can port your array to another 
machine without any reconfiguration, on completely different hardware. You 
can also RAID two different technologies, for example PATA and SATA, hot-add 
spares, run with a deliberately failed array, build incomplete arrays (nice 
if you're just about to start a RAID5 but don't have enough discs), the list 
goes on..
