These are not isolated problems. Linux needs a properly designed
graphics subsystem. One way to achieve that is to design it all on
paper first so that we can try and locate the interactions between
modules. For example the current mode setting design is definitely
broken for multi-seat support, that's because you didn't take that
feature into account when writing the code.
Putting a small module into the kernel first with a random API, then
try and build the next module is not a good development path. It is
better to design all of the modules on paper and then work backwards
to the API the first module needs.  Even better would be to get the
whole subsystem working before including it in the kernel. Once these
exposed APIs go it, it is impossible to get them out. We need to try
and make sure that they are correct to begin with.
You need to take into account that you are proposing the replacement
of an existing subsystem, not the initial inclusion of a virgin
system. Putting your code in as is does make the X server happy, but
it is not solving all of the known problems with the existing graphics
subsystem. If you just want to make to X server happy it would be
better to extend the existing fbdev API and not try and replace the
subsystem.
