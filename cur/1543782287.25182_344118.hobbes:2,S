Hi,Takashi Iwai & PeiSen Hou:
We add some codes in hda_intel.c which is in
alsa-driver-1.0.9b/alsa-kernel/pci/hda/ folder to support our HDA
controller ULi M5461.
Because that our controller has little different with Intel:
1.The M5461 have 11 streams(5 input streams and 6 output streams), and the
Intel's controller is only support 8 streams.
2.The M5461 CORB/RIRB size's default value is 2 entries, and it need to set
to 256 entries.
Could you please update the hda driver to support our controller M5461?
Thanks.
The following file is the patch of the hda_intel.c file. we have made a
full test for it.
