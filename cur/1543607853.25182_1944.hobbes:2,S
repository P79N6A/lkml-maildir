After upgrading to linux-2.4.13-ac5, everything seems to work, except all
my vtun tunnels.
a _lot_ of searching revealed this code fragment:
        /*
         * Verify the string as this thing may have come from
         * the user.  There must be one "%d" and no other "%"
         * characters.
         */
        p = strchr(name, '%');
        if (!p || p[1] != 'd' || strchr(p+2, '%'))
                return -EINVAL;
Well, obviously my devicename _do_ come "from the user", as I really like
to name my tun devices (and everything else). The problem is that vtund
passes in "tun2" as devicename, which does not contain a "%d".
Maybe this piece of code is designed to fix security problems, but it
keeps vtund from working properly.
How about this change?
-        if (!p || p[1] != 'd' || strchr(p+2, '%'))
+        if (p && (p[1] != 'd' || strchr(p+2, '%')))
