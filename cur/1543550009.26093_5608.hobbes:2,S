Well, that's not much of answer.  It certainly doesn't mean anything to people
who have port drivers with tens of thousands of lines of code, all in C++.
I haven't tried C++ in Linux drivers myself, but I assume it can't be any more
difficult than what I had to do for OS/2.  Five years ago (imagine that - OS/2
is years ahead of Linux in this regard), I hacked up a method for getting C++
code to compile into an OS/2 device driver.  I had to write some extra code,
but it was really no problem.
Sure, I couldn't use exception handlers, but so what?  All I needed to do was
define malloc() and free(), and I could create and destroy objects whenever I
wanted.  In fact, you don't even need malloc() and free() - the C++ language
allows you to redined new and delete on a per-class basis.  
Then I created some stub functions that would normally be called under an error
condition (like a missing virtual method in a subclass).  In fact, the linker
did all the work in this case - when I tried to link my driver with no runtime,
it gave me a nice list of missing functions, and all I had to do was create
stubs for them.
