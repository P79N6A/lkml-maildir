Erk! Yuk! How painful. Well, I'm definately not suggesting that. If we
were to move net interfaces into the normal device namespace, there
would be a /dev/net directory which would just have "eth0", "eth1",
"ppp0" and so on. That will provide the easy interface (for the
typical case where you only have one interface).

Blech!

Indeed. We don't want to lose that. But it would be nice to be also be
able to reference interfaces based on their location. I've set up two
routers (each with 3 interfaces) where both "logical" guesses were
wrong (the order was in fact eth0, eth2, eth1 going from left to
right).
