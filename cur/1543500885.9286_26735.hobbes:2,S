You don't need to shout. 
There is nothing wrong with having an older version of the same
compiler around.

On the systems I admin are installed two compilers, the first one
being 
$ gcc -v
Reading specs from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
And the other one
$ kgcc -v
Reading specs from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.7.2.3/specs
gcc driver version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
executing gcc version 2.7.2.3 
kgcc is only a script ... cat /usr/bin/kgcc
#!/bin/sh
exec gcc -V2.7.2.3 -b i386-redhat-linux $*
Works nicely, doesn't consume too much diskspace, and you can
compile with egcs while you are compiling your kernel (which
shouldn't happen too often) without changing one file.
