I've just now finished to patch, compile and install 2.6.1-rc1 and it seems to 
be ok, without any error.
Your patch doesn't apply clearly over rc1-mm1 or rc1-mm2 (too many hunks 
failed), so I've tryied to patch vanilla rc1.
Reboot was ok, without any warning or error about framebuffer.
I use XFree from debian experimental (4.3.0-0pre1v4) and now it appears more 
smooth than with 2.4.23-ck1! (thanks a lot!!!)
At system startup I always choose video=sisfb:1024x768x256 to show linux logo 
but if I try to boot without it, all characters aren't displayed very well... 
Glxgears shows me 250 Fps (exactly as 2.4), but when cpu (p4m 1.6 ghz) reachs 
100%, ALT-TAB switching between apps is not fluid like with 2.4...  
Probably it's a scheduler issue...
However, it's a great job!!!
So, what about your patches in 2.6 mainline ?
Ok ok ...  only another question... :)
Do you have some news about DRI for my SiS chipset? 
glxinfo shows me:
------------------------------
D998:/home/io# glxinfo
name of display: :0.0
Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
display: :0  screen: 0
direct rendering: No
server glx vendor string: SGI
server glx version string: 1.2
server glx extensions:
....
TIA,
					Jorge
PS: sorry for all lexical mistakes I made...
