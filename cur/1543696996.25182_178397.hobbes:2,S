Ok, suppose the list of entries consists of elements:
A -> B -> C -> D ->( A )
where "->" is a "next" pointer and the last element points back to A, i.e. 
circular list.
Suppose each element requires 2040 bytes of data to be passed to the user 
app.
Now, the user application issues a call:
struct elem elem[10];
len = read(fd, elem, 10*sizeof(struct elem));
(small digression about PAGE_SIZE Now, if you just strace dd
if=/proc/slabinfo bs=8192 you will see that a read for 8192 bytes returned
only 4056 bytes and then the next read for 8192 bytes returned 66 bytes.
This is why I was saying that a single read is limited to a single page.)
Now, back to our abstract list. The normal (intuitive, e.g. seq_printf())  
->show() implementation will manage to pack A and B into m->buf but
hitting the element C it will have to return -1 (otherwise the kernel will
oops because m->buf isn't large enough). So, the userspace got back A and
B in a single read, i.e. 4080 bytes. On the next read() the ->start()
routine will try to arrive at the element with offset 2 (I think it
counted from 0). And since ->stop()  routine was called we dropped the
spinlock guarding the list. So, which element is now at distance 2 from A?
It's not necessarily C because it could have been unlinked. But this is OK
because if C was unlinked then we don't want to see it anyway. The bad
case is if the element B was unlinked then the element at distance 2 would
be D and we would "miss" C.  This is the sense in which we can "miss" an
element.
Is there any error in the above?
Kind regards
Tigran
