Won't this serialize too much ?  I mean, consider the situation where we
have file-A and file-B completely in cache, while file-C needs to be
read from the physical disk.
Three different clients (A, B and C) request file-A, file-B and file-C
respectively. The send of file-C is started first, and the sends of files
A and B (which could commence immediately and complete at near wire-speed)
will now have to wait (leaving the NIC idle) until file-C is read from
the disks.
Even if it's not the entire file but only a single NFS request (probably 8kB),
one disk seek (7ms) is still around 85 kB, or 10 8kB NFS requests (at 100Mbit).
Or am I misunderstanding ?   Will your UDP sendpage() queue the requests ?
