Subject: 2.2.x - IPX overbroadcasting (badly)

I've been having trouble with IPX in the 2.2.x kernels, with an apparent
flood of broadcast packets originating from our Linux box.  It appears
to have improved slightly with the introduction of kernel 2.2.3
(previously it would begin the moment we enabled IPX, now it may take a
minute or so), but it still overloads our network so badly that no one
is able to use it.  2.0.x doesn't seem to have any difficulty.
Since I don't know what else to do, I'm attaching the output from
running tcpdump both before and after enabling IPX.  There was only
about a one minute delay between the two runs, so there was no
appreciable difference in network traffic (up until the packet storm
started, of course <g>).  Our network is token-ring, and the mac address
of the Linux box is 0:0:83:25:cb:66.
I'm not really familiar with tcpdump, so I hope I've included the
required information.  If I need to rerun it with different parameters,
or if there's any more information I can provide, please let me know.
Thanx!
