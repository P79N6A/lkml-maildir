Something committed in the last 24 hours is causing my machine
to halt partway thru bootup.  It will print appropriate messages
on the console for USB hotplug events, but networking never
comes up so I can't ping the machine, and the login process
never starts so I can't login and I can't tell what processes
are actually running.
When I boot yesterday's kernel I get error messages saying
that the kernel modules (from today) can't be loaded because
they are in the wrong format.  That's an error I've never seen
before this morning.  The only thing I can think to do is to
recompile with all the drivers compiled into the kernel and
see if I get any error messages (I'm not seeing any errors
now).
Anyone else seeing anything like this?
