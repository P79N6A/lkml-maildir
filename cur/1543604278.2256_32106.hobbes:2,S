You could try this patch I made 
http://www.geocities.com/dotslashstar/cpqfc.html
Though it was made for 2.4.10-ac8, there's a reasonably good chance it
will still work.  This patch incidentally fixes the problem you mention, but
mainly the patch removes use of virt_to_bus and bus_to_virt from the cpqfc
driver.and uses the 2.4.x PCI DMA  interfaces instead.  (Note, I haven't tried
this patch with 2.4.11 yet myself).
