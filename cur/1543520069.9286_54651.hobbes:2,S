        It is better to allow that _as an option_.  Of course you have to
allow explicit flushes.  But you also need to have implicit flushing for
the sake of performance.  The nice thing about the page fault method is
that it allows you to tune the size and faulting behavior of the ping and
pong buffers on the fly as needed.  This is a wonderful way to get the
most out of those fifo watermark interrupts I mentioned before.  If the
high watermark IRQ fires, your driver code is pushing the hardware fifo
too hard.  Usually that means that userspace code is pushing the driver
too hard, so you can throttle back the userspace command buffer filling
code by faulting more often and then raise the ping/pong buffer size so
faults occur less often.  If the low watermark IRQ fires, you are starving
the hardware and should fault more often unless scheduling priorities
prevent this or your buffer size == PAGE_SIZE.

Correct.
