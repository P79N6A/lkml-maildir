I believe what you see between 2.4 and 2.6 is just lack of readahead, 
and you should increase this for your read performance. With no other 
changes you should be able to pretty much match performance between 2.4 
and 2.6.
However, after some years of trying to tune stripe size on both Linux 
and AIX news servers, I suspect that the stripe size you have is too 
small. The optimal stripe size under heavy load seems to be at least 2x 
the largest typical io size, so that you don't have to seek on multiple 
drives all the time. Note "at least," in most cases you can go larger 
than that unless you create and delete a lot of files, in which case you 
can wind up with the inodes on one drive, which can be a real issue.
For this reason I find that most install programs are about worthless, 
they simply use too small a stripe size and generate a lot of overhead 
when used, because too many io are on multiple devices. That's good for 
huge io on separate busses where bus bandwidth is a factor, but very bad 
when most of the time is latency.
