Compilation error in Linux kernel 2.2.0 
File: drivers/sound/sb_card.c
sb_card.c has integer "esstype" defined in "#ifdef MODULE" and this
variable is needed in sb_ess.c even without compiled as a module:
drivers/sound/sound.a(sb_ess.o): In function `ess_init':
sb_ess.o(.text+0xde2): undefined reference to `esstype'
sb_ess.o(.text+0xe77): undefined reference to `esstype' 
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
When someone fixes this, could you send me the patch? Thanks.
Regards,
  Matias Griese
