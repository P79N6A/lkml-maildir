However, this has *always* been the case - there's never been a guarantee that
mounting a possibly-maliciously modified filesystem won't trash things.  That's
why "force fsck on dirty bit set" was created way back in the Unix Stone Age.
And all you have to do to exploit it is get yourself a trashed filesystem, put it on
removable media, and clear the dirty bit...
