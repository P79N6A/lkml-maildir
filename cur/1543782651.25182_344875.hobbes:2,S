You are probably right, but do you want to put in a patch that might
have a big performance impact in either direction with out verifying
it?
My suggestion is safe, but most likely sub-optimal.  What everyone
else is suggesting may be far better, but needs to be verified first.
I'm suggesting that we change the code to do the same work fork would
have done on the first page fault immediately, since it's easy to
argue that it's not much worse than we have now and much better in
many cases, and then try to experiment and figure out  what the
correct solution is.
