:) thats true, but to be 100% honest I used different code to test for
hash artifacts...
That code was created to show that it is possible to _have_ artifacts,
but not specially to _find_ them.
But it still does not fix artifacts with for example const IP and random
ports or const IP and linear port selection.
Values must be specially tuned to be used with Jenkins hash, for example
linear port with const IP produce following hash buckets:
100 24397
200 12112
300 3952
400 975
500 178
600 40
700 3
800 1
i.e. one 800-entries bucket (!) while xor one always have only 100 of
them (for 100*hash_size number of iterations).
So, your prove does not valid :)
