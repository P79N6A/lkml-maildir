Subject: [PATCH 2.6.20-rc2] Add a quirk to allow ENE PCI SD card readers to work again
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Add a quirk to allow ENE PCI SD card readers to work again
Support for these devices was broken for 2.6.18-rc1 and later by commit
146ad66eac836c0b976c98f428d73e1f6a75270d, which added voltage level support.
This restores the previous behaviour for these devices by ensuring that when
the voltage is changed, only one write to set the voltage is performed.
It may be that both writes are needed if the voltage is being changed between
two non-zero values or that it's safe to ensure that only one write is done
if the hardware only supports one voltage; I don't know whether either is the
case nor can I test since I have only the one SD reader (1524:0550), and it
supports just the one voltage.
