This is ext3 with ordered data?

Wow minix is faster than ext2 @)  That certainly looks strange. 
Any chance to test XFS too?

Normally (non data journaling, noatime) journaling fs shouldn't have any
overhead for database load, because database files should be preallocated
and the database should do direct IO in/out the preallocated buffers
with the FS never doing any metadata writes, except for occassional inode
updates for mtime depending on what sync mode that DB uses (hmm, I guess a 
nomtime or verylazymtime or alwaysasyncmtime mount option could be helpful 
for that) 
That's the theory, but doesn't seem to be the case in your test. I guess
your test is not very realistic then.

Kind of ordered I believe.
