Subject: cannot eject drive using pktcdvd

I see the following bug since I've enabled packet writing for my dvd 
drive (using the udftools package):
- eject won't open the tray unless I'm root
- whether I'm root or not, I get the following error when running eject:
     "eject: unable to eject, last error: Invalid argument"
   and in the system logs:
"program eject is using a deprecated SCSI ioctl, please convert it to SG_IO"
The command: pktsetup dvd /dev/cdrom ; eject
should allow anyone with a cd/dvd writer to reproduce this bug.
Disabling packet writing ("pktsetup -d dvd") solves the problem and 
everything works fine (no strange message in the logs).
I _think_ this could be related to Redhat bug 137349 
(
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=137349
),
but I could be wrong...
Regards,
Vince
