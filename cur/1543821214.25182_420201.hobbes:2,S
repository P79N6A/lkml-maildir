Note that if you're setting 5ms as your timeout for detecting a *crash*,
and your *ping* takes 3ms, that leaves you a whole whopping 2ms.  If you
have 1ms scheduler latency at *each* end (remember - you're in userspace
at both ends, right?) you have approximately 0ms left for the remote end to
actually *do* anything, and for the local end to process the reply.
And if the remote end has to issue a syscall during processing the request,
you're basically screwed.
You need to be adding at least 1 zero to that timeout value.
