This is really a problem for Cisco support, not the kernel people.
(And despite my email address I really have no idea who looks after
the VPN client).
However I can suggest vpnc (
http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/vpnc/
)
as an alternative.  I'm not forced to use Cisco VPN access any more,
but when I tried it, vpnc was tons better than the Cisco product.
