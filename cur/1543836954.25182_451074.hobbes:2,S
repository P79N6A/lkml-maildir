So I narrowed down the problem but it isn't obvious to me why this problem
exists.  Basically, even though bytes_out is supposed to be initialized to
0, it becomes -1 before entering decompress_kernel().  Of course, the
fallout is in flush_window() bytes_out wounds up being one less than
outcnt and hence my original problem.
Any thoughts on how to debug where this could be getting corrupted?  
Cheers,
Don
