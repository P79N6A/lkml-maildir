Correct, and your case is different than from power on cold.
Regardless, you isse EXECUTE DIAGNOSITCS and there are device which wait
until the last minute to respond.
There are things called shadow registers.
Where the slave device answers for or as the master device in this special
case.  Now if you have a master (atapi) without shadow registers but slave
(atapi) with shadow registers, guess what sometimes the master negates
the slaves attempt to report.  So this command fails here even after a
warm boot.
Now what?
