Yes, I suppose it must be. That's quite frightening.

Definitely. IIRC, there's not a lot we can do about this - at least with a 
16550a, you can't get it to interrupt any earlier. We just have to make sure 
that we service the interrupt PDQ.
I think I calculated that this shouldn't be too much of a problem - we can't
run at more than 19200 baud (I don't think we can set a divisor for 93750) so 
we have 11/19200 = ~573 microseconds to respond.

Don't do that then. Seriously, if you're using IDE disks in a machine you're 
trying to do this kind of thing on, then I don't want to know you.

Definitely. The strict checking on the receive side is only for purposes of 
attaining certification. We can get it to work happily without that. We just 
need to ensure that we wait for 33 bit times before sending, and that we don't 
have gaps in the packets we send.
I'm handwaving at this point - I'm not ready to specify exactly what I want, 
I'm just pointing out my requirements as the subject happened to come up.
I'm fairly sure can get software Profibus to work without really having to play
silly buggers with the existing line discipline interface. 
Once I get to that stage, I'll have a far clearer idea of exactly what I want
to change in order to get certification, and I'll get back to it. Or just 
decide that I don't actually want to get certification for it anyway.
