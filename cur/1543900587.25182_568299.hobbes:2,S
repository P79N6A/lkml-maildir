Ah, good to know others are looking at it.
On a different front, I see .21.6-rt21 came out in the last 24 hours.
Were there any fixes that went in between rt20-21 here, or was it simply
a forward port?  If fixes, could you possibly share them to save me the
effort of working it out myself?  I will then push the next version of
the 22-based forward port to rt21 today.
