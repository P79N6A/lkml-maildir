I looked at this and got even more puzzled.
__handle_sysrq temporarily sets the loglevel to 7 (KERN_DEBUG) for the
duration of the sysrq-<whatever> output.
Which is odd, as KERN_DEBUG stuff is usually hidden, yet the
printk's that lack loglevels still seem to end up onscreen.
Ted's patch also misses a few of the printk's in show_free_areas()
which seems inconsistent, or am I just confused?
