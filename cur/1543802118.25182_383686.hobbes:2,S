This is correct.

That's a slightly different problem, one which is handled by the mm
layer.  Basically, whenever a page is unmapped from userspace on
aliasing caches, user cache lines need to be invalidated.  Consider
this case:
- A page is mapped into userspace, and is subsequently removed and
  freed without invalidating the cache lines.
- The kernel allocates this page for it's own purposes and writes data
  to the kernel mapping of the page (eg, a slab page).
- At some time later, the cache lines corresponding with the old
  userspace mapping are evicted from the cache and written back to
  the page.
The result is that corruption occurs to this re-used page - and no
device driver has been involved.  So this isn't a problem that
device driver authors need to care about.

For msync(), it uses flush_cache_range() prior to marking the pages
dirty (and therefore candidates for being written to devices.)
In the case of swapping pages out, flush_cache_page() is used to
ensure that user data is written to the page.
The final case is write(), where the standard rule is followed -
if the kernel mapping of a page cache page is written by the CPU,
flush_dcache_page() is used after the page has been written.
There's probably other cases as well (I'm not a mm hacker so it's an
area of the kernel I'm not familiar with.)

That depends.  The common case for reads from device drivers is
that a page has just been allocated, but not mapped into user
space.  It has been submitted to the block layer to have the
required data placed into the page.
Given that, and a read of Documentation/cachetlb.txt, if an
architecture implements the idea given there, flush_dcache_page()
should just set the PG_arch_1 bit for this case.
So it should be rather light.

That's something I can't comment on.
