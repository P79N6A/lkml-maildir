OK, this one boots but Gnome does not start.  It hangs at "Session
Manager".  The system does not hang, but I never get to my desktop. 
Nothing useful in the logs.
While this was going on I switched to a text console and noticed that if
I enabled/ Caps Lock at just the right moment then _all_ text output
(LOGIN, PASSWORD, etc) would be in caps.  Toggling it a few times seemed
to get rid of the problem.
Any particular debug options I should try?
