It seems that io_request_lock will be completely removed in 2.5 tree, so
there is no io_request_lock in linux/blk.h. This global lock now exsist
only in scsi layer, and it will be replaced by Scsi_Host->host_lock soon.
So i hope this patch will help a bit in this direction.
2 Paulo Andre: DON'T use this patch before Jens Axboe will agree with it,
because i even haven't scsi here, so this patch was written only with
common sence. I hope this will help you.
