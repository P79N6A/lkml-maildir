But they can already do that, by subscribing to the respective mailing list 
(obviously, the bot posts to the list as well as forwarding to the 
maintainer) and running the mails through a filter of their choice.

OK, it would be nice, but you wouldn't want to pile on so many features that 
this never gets implemented would you?  The minimal thing that forwards and 
posts patches is what we need now.  Like any other software it can be 
improved over time.

Automating the applied/dropped status is clearly the next problem to tackle, 
but that's harder, it involves behavioral changes on the maintainers side.  
(Pragmatically, providing a web interface so somebody whose job it is to do 
that, can efficiently post 'applied' messages to the list would get the job 
done without making anyone learn new tools or change the way they work.)
By the way, who is going to code this?  Or are we determined to make 
ourselves look like wankers once again, by putting considerably more time 
into the lkml flamewar than goes into producing working code?
(Hint: I am not going to code it, nor should I since I should be working in 
the kernel.)
