Oops, I forgot to test that: I had both implementations.
Doing a million loop (so there's loop overhead):
	350MHz dual Pentium II, atomic is almost twice as fast
	PPC 500MHz G4: atomic is 3.5 times as fast.
	Power3 4-way 375MHz machine: atomic is 10% faster.
	Power4 4-way 1.3GHz machine: atomic was 20% slower (depending
	       on version if irq_restore).
I suspect a P4 might get similar pro-irq results (code below,
anyone?)
Ideally we'd have a "local_inc()" and "local_dec()".  Architectures
which do soft interrupts enabling should see a real win from the
save/restore version.
Meanwhile, I'll revert to atomics, since it's sometimes dramatically
faster.
Thanks!
Rusty.
