Hm, if you look at SuSE and Fedora, they too are putting usbfs in
/dev/bus/usb/ now, not mounting the filesystem, but using the device
nodes for access due to ACLs for local users.
libusb works just fine with this, and I think that all other programs
that directly access the old /proc/bus/usb mount are fixed up, with the
exception of usbview (but I do have patches floating around for that to
solve it.)
