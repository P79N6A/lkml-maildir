Hello:
Quick swap file question here:
Under 2.2.x what is recommended swap sizes?
I'm running 384MB of RAM and as was pointed out yesterday making a
768MB swap is a bit of overkill....I seem to remember that in the
"old" 1.x days the recommendation was to have swap 2x RAM
amount...what would you suggest for the above setup? I'm also running
a P-II 366MHz chip.
Thanks,
George
