I'ma happy user of dm-crypt since march, too.
No problems here.
However I wonder: can people switch to a 2.4.*
kernel if they are using dm-crypt? Even if the
disk format is compatible, the software used
to setup the decrypted access is different.
I guess for / partitions people need to use
loop-crypt, if they want to use 2.4.* and 2.6.*
kernels?
