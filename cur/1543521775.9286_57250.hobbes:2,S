Andrea,
you fixed the last race in sys_wait4() and you often tweak the
scheduler, perhaps you can help me:
sys_wait4() calls put_user() with current->state == TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.
other functions call get_user() with this current->state.
If put_user() must page-in the target page, then it would return with
current->state == TASK_RUNNING, correct?
But: is it guaranteed that the function will return? In the worst case,
there is no wait-queue that would force a wake-up.
Thanks,
	Manfred
