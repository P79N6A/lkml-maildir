If select was restarted it would wait its timeout again.
With a SIGALRM timer in just the right period you could make a select()
block forever, even if it was supposed to timeout. This happens in practice,
e.g. with some versions of the DNS resolver when you have a periodic timer
running. Fixing this would complicate the system call restart mechanism a lot
and also probably break some programs.
