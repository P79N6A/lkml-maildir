Because irq_exit() doesn't call do_softirq() in 2.4 where I developed this
arch in the first place. And because 2.6 didn't malfunction due to
do_softirq() being called twice, I didn't notice.
Actually... it's probably also bad that it calls irq_exit() first and then
__clr_MASK(). That means it runs softirq processing with at least one
interrupt level disabled:-/
