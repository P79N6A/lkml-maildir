There is a connex, fork() might be a bad example,
it's simple - yes but 20 years have passed as Solaris
is finding:
pid_t fork(void); vs. 
the next step in the evolution CreateProcess
BOOL CreateProcess(
  LPCTSTR lpApplicationName,
  LPTSTR lpCommandLine,
  LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpProcessAttributes,
  LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes,
  BOOL bInheritHandles,
  DWORD dwCreationFlags,
  LPVOID lpEnvironment,
  LPCTSTR lpCurrentDirectory,
  LPSTARTUPINFO lpStartupInfo,
  LPPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation
evolved to .Net Process Class
System.Object
   System.MarshalByRefObject
      System.ComponentModel.Component
         System.Diagnostics.Process
[C#]
public class Process : Component
[C++]
public __gc class Process : public Component
with a full list of members mapping to the overall
model per se (link to hell, but they've got a point) 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdiagnosticsprocessmemberstopic.asp
So let me restate the need again for a:
* unified well architected core component model
which is extensible from OS services to application
objects
* the object model should be defined from the kernel
layer for process/events/devices etc. up and not
started at the application layer
