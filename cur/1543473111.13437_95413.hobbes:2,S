There is only one place in sound_core.c::init_module, where we
can return -EBUSY:
        if(register_chrdev(SOUND_MAJOR, "sound", &soundcore_fops)==-1)
        {
                printk(KERN_ERR "soundcore: sound device already in use.\n");
                return -EBUSY;
        }
But there is also KERN_ERR message printed and I do not know of any
linux distributin, that disables displaying of messages of such loglevel
on console. Seems strange for me.
Bye,
