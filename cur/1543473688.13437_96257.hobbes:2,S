yes, i am having similar problem with 2.2.0-pre2.
i've been digging around, and the error is coming from
/usr/src/linux/fs/fat/inode.c
370:  printk("fat_read_super: Bad fsinfo_offset\n");
but i don't know where to look from here. i guess it
might be useful to examine the patch from 2.1.132->2.2.0
(yes i am *totally* new to this and very lost! some one
help me learn to hack this beast! please)
brent
that's all i can
