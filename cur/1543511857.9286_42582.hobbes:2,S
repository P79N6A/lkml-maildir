hmm, stat based...  So presumably it does something like:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    struct stat statBuf;
    unsigned int major, minor;
    stat("/", &statBuf);
    major=minor=statBuf.st_dev;
    printf("/ is on device major %d, minor %d\n",
            major>>8, minor&0xff);
    return( 0);
}
while that does work, the problem with this approach is you have to look
under the kernel's hood to discover how the kernel _currently_ defines
a dev_t. Suppose somebody next week decides we don't have enough minor
numbers for the new XP-37 5000-slot DVD changer... boom.
Having just read the util-linux mount source more carefully, I realised
that the /etc/mtab entry mount writes is correct and that has to come
from somewhere. I couldn't believe they would abuse stat, and I was right;
I have found a better solution:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fstab.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    struct fstab* fstabBuf;
    printf("/ is on device %s\n", 
	(getfsfile ("/"))->fs_spec);
    return( 0);
}
which works and won't be as fragile.
of course, /proc/mounts is still wrong, but I can special case "/"
pretty easily now without needing the kernel to be fixed.

Ok, bad example, sorry. however, my point was that the kernel is lying.

same thing as always. I didn't mess with NFS (which is a special case in
the kernel mount code), I just touched the non-NFS cases. I don't know
what can be done to make the NFS case in /proc/mounts more correct.
