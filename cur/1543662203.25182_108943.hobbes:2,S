I've seen a number of postings to the list complaining of output to the 
console ceasing after the Uncompressing Linux line at the beginning of 
boot.  I ran into this myself.  
I believe one cause of this is the new console on framebuffer console 
configuration option.  I believe some people are not turning on the 
option, but then are trying to output to the framebuffer by selecting a 
video mode which does that.
I've also ran into what seems an anomaly in the configuration options.  If 
Input device selection is set to modular (CONFIG_INPUT) then it doesn't 
seem to be possible to turn on virtual terminal (CONFIG_VT) or support for 
console on virtual terminal (CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE).  At least in make 
menuconfig, those  options don't appear if the former isn't set to y.  It 
is going to be rather difficult to see console output if those aren't  
available isn't it?
