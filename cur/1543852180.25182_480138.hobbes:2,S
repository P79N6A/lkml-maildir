Because mutexes are not supposed to be released by anything other than
the thread that took them, as enforced by the various checking code and
noted in the docs...
"The stricter mutex API means you cannot use mutexes the same way you
can use semaphores: e.g. they cannot be used from an interrupt context,
nor can they be unlocked from a different context that which acquired
it."
this particular resource can sometimes be locked & unlocked from 2
different userspace threads.
