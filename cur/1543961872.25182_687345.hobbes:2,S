We've found some bugs that may explain what you've got. Anyway, most of they
are fixed. I'm preparing a pull request for Linus later today.
> I have now done the merge of the v4l-dvb tree in linux-next and I have had several conflicts, the worst being in the file drivers/media/Kconfig between commit 7c91f0624a9a2b8b9b122cf94fef34bc7f7347a6 ("V4L/DVB(7767): Move tuners to common/tuners") in Linus' tree and commit 9c76e847539ab7a73e82ff692862f3de9fa19ddb ("V4L/DVB(7767): Move tuners to common/tuners") in the v4l-dvb tree. 
The same patch were on both Linus and my tree. -git sometimes don't like
this ;) 
Anyway, I've already dropped those patches that were already applied from my
tree. You should get a clean merge tomorrow.
Cheers,
Mauro
