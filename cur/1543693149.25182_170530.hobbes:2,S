uh, i guess this masm/windoze/elf32 stuff is too much for me, i could 
try, but don't have time to dig into this. but you could try my script, 
and run benchmarks on your machine too.
but: how is this twofish optimization supposed to go into mainline 
anyway? one had to use a special compiling environment to compile a kernel?
i set up these benchmarks for me too, because i needed to know what 
cipher is fast enough for my own use. usually i sticked to serpent, now 
aes-i586 looks quite good on this PC. i wonder if it will compile and so 
something on ppc32 too, but probably not. which is a pity, because my 
primary use of the cryptoloop is a ppc :-(
Thank you,
Christian.
