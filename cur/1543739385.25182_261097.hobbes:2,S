OOPS. I think I've made a terrible mistake. It seems that
SMP+PREEMPT_REALTIME is NOT solved after all in my P4/HT box, even with
PREEMPT_TIMING not set.
As one may check from the .config.gz I've sent just about minutes ago,
PREEMPT_REALTIME wasn't being set, and the RT label was bogus.
So sorry to mislead you all. I should have known, it was too good to be
true :(
Take care.
