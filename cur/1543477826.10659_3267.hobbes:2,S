Tested both but got no better performance.

Correct!
That's the cause, why i made a quick hack (not that smart for sure ;*) )
which free's buffer memory again, limits page cache and avoids all that
swapping (see patch below).
If the hack makes sense to you my refill_freelist() code should
go to linux/mm/vmscan.c and buffer_mem.max_percent should come back to
implement a better check in grow_buffers().
Did anybody think about correcting linux/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt?

I agree to Andrea's argument and vote for extension of the admin interface
(buffer_mem.max_percent etc.)
