Hi,
I'm having some problems with my via-rhine ethernet card.
I have a crossed cable running from the card to an ADSL modem.
Regularly (at least once every two days) I have connections problems 
and I'm unable to even ping the ADSL modem. On /var/log/messages I see the 
message:
kernel: eth0: reset did not complete in 10 ms.
kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status 0000, PHY status 782d, 
resetting...
Removing the ethernet cable, unloading/loading the module doesn't change a
thing, only a cold reboot fixes the problem (until next time).
Is this a known problem? Any fixes?
