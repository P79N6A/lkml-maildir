Seriously.  If we're going to have devfs, let's do it right rather
than half-hack it in /proc.  The /proc stuff has all the problems of a
super-naïve implementation of devfs, and unlike Richard's devfs
doesn't have even a hacky way around the problems.
Now devfs is in the kernel, so let's just work out the kinks and make
it do what we need it to do.
