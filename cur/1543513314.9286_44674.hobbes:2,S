Sorry, you're confused about this.  The point of raw devices is so that
the application can KNOW that the data has got to the device and that
another system reading from the same device will read the data which it
just wrote.  This is exactly what is needed for multiple-server database
applications.  Think how bad it would be for your database to write a
block to the shared disc, and then have a different machine access the
stale data which happens to be in its buffer cache.
