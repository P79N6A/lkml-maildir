A little bit of readahead will be helpful for flash memory.  Its latency is
low, but sure not zero. Asynchronous readahead will help to hide the latency.

My favorite test cases are
big file:
        time cp $file /dev/null &>/dev/null
        time dd if=$file of=/dev/null \ bs=${bs:-4k} &>/dev/null
big file, parallel:
        time diff $file $file.clone
small files:
        time grep -qr 'doruimi' $dir 2>/dev/null
Don't forget to clear the cache before each run:
        echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
Cheers,
