Subject: [PATCH] itmtouch: fix inverted flag to indicate touch location correctly, correct white space
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Mark Assad <massad@gmail.com>
There is a bug in the current version of the itmtouch USB touchscreen
driver. The if statment that checks if pressure is being applied to
the touch screen is now missing a ! (not), so events are no longer
being reported correctly.
The origonal source code for this line was as follows:
#define UCP(x) ((unsigned char*)(x))
#define UCOM(x,y,z) ((UCP((x)->transfer_buffer)[y]) & (z))
if (!UCOM(urb, 7, 0x20)) {
And was cleaned to:
 unsigned char *data = urb->transfer_buffer;
....
 if (data[7] & 0x20) {
(note the lack of ! )
This has been tested on an LG L1510BF and an LG1510SF touch screen.
Patched applied from: linux-2.6.18
(resent because I mangled the whitespace from gmail. Sorry!)
