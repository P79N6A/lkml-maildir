I am not persuaded by this example. Why didn't thread A close the file 
when it finished the network I/O? That would be logical time to do it. If 
it wasn't a file descriptor, but a shared memory region, would you argue 
the same about a mutex protecting that memory region?
I think this should not be a question of personal opinions or specific 
examples. It should just be consistent. Two reference platforms for 
threads are Solaris and Windows. I don't know how Solaris handles this, 
but on Windows file locks are per thread, not per process.
