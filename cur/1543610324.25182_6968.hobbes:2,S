imagine 
typedef volatile int sig_atomic_t;

Imagine this:
if (likely(foo))
	c = 1
else	c = 2
I could see it optimized as
c = 1
if (unlikely(foo))
	c = 2
Given enough register pressure.... I've seen similar optimalizations proposed
in "advanced compilers" book.

PS: but wrapping access to current->flags in macro is probably okay for now.
I just wanted to show that writing unwanted value is not as broken as you
think.
