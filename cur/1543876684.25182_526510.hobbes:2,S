So "make oldconfig ARCH=powerpc" will accept a config that doesn't have a 
platform selected?

Hmmm...  So CONFIG_PPC_MULTIPLATFORM doesn't cover it?  ("There is no help 
available for this kernel option"...  Maybe a website somewhere?)
I just ran "make oldconfig" again and it didn't complain about any of those

Er, never.  I was largely guessing at what I needed via menuconfig.  (I'm 
trying to get something I can boot to a shell prompt under QEMU.)
I'll try this CHRP thing...
