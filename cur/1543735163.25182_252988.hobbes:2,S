Is that really more frequent than just 'foo->le16_field = 12' ? 
I'm surprised. 
Certainly, it was the frequency of pure assignment without _any_ attempt
at byte-swapping which caused me to introduce the 'jint32_t' et al
structures in jffs2, which even gcc then bitches about if you use them
wrongly.
I suppose I can ditch those now -- I always intended to after a while
anyway.
