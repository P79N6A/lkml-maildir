It sounds you are still struggling to get something that works and gets
done what needs to be done.  So let me suggest a simplified semantic that
should be easier to implement and test, and solves the biggest problem
that we must solve in the kernel.
- container-init ignores SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.
- container-init is responsible for setting the rest of the signals
  to SIG_IGN.
If that isn't enough for all of the init's we can go back and
solve more in kernel land.  That simplified semantic is certainly
enough for sysvinit.

That sounds like correct behavior.
