Please please please use a different name for "I know I'm not preemptible but
I can handle it" or a flag or something.
That leaves us with the possibility of a BUG() in the "normal" copy_to/from_user
for all those "I'm holding a spinlock while copying to userspace wheeee!" bugs.
Very common mistake for new kernel authors.
With the preempt count we have an easy way of detecting this at runtime: I'd
like to keep that.
Rusty.
