In lhms tree, current status is below: (If I'm wrong, plz fix)

For mlock, direct page migration will work fine. try_to_unmap_one()
in -mhp tree has an argument *force* and ignore VM_LOCKED, it's for this.
For direct-io, we have to wait for completion.
The end of I/O is not notified and memory_migrate() is just polling pages.
For hugepages, we'll need hugepage demand paging and more work, I think.

When a process migrates to other nodes by hand, it can cooperate with migration
subsystem. So we don't have to be afraid of some special using of memory, in many case.
I think Christoph's approach will work fine.
When it comes to memory-hotplug, arbitrary processes are affected.
It's more difficult.
We should focus on 'process migraion on demand', in this thread.
