3) Re-write/replace drivers/char/rtc.c in 2.5.  This is something I've
been thinking about for a bit because of the number of 'generic' RTC
drivers, and how they only vary slighlty.  And then there are some
hw-specific RTC drivers (efirtc.c) which could be modified to be a
personality for the new generic rtc driver.  The m68k/APUS version right
now uses a 'mach_hwclk' which handles the actual get/set bits.  I
haven't worked out all of the details just yet, but I'm thinking some of
the arch/hw-specific bits will be in a different file and on a per-arch
baises on how mach_hwclk is actually done.  Eg PPC would still end up
calling the right ppc_md version, x86 (and default) would yeild the
current behavior.
And this all relates to the original post since we could make sure that
other arches have access to any functions they might need internally.
Is there anyone else out there who's been thinking about reworking the
RTC driver?
