Hi,
Firstly, it seems my 'make loops forever' issue have been solved
somewhere along the line (sorry, have not checked much after rc3 I
think, so not sure when).
Then, I tried to build it against klibc, but eventually ended up
hacking configure.in, some Makefiles, some more source files, and
generally butchered it to submission, followed by manual linking
to actually get a working binary.  Is this a known issue, or does
it currently only work against some special (RH?) version of klibc?
Also, what about including klibc/libdevmapper trees like udev, etc
to make this a bit more painless?
Lastly, is it planned to enable the user to specify his own dm
volume names ?
Thanks,
