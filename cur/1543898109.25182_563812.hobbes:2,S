OK, I was really using no_hz, and with nohz I got approx the same result
as with CONFIG_NO_HZ=n.  Uups.

Probably you understand that better, but your argument only convinced me
for a short time.  Is it really better to program at least once and in
the idle case a 2nd time instead of only once every time.  Moreover
if you program the timer late you can notice if the time to tick is
already over because the timer irq handling took to long (or CONFIG_HZ
is too large).

I found the problem, it had only indirectly to do with nohz.  I didn't
acknowledge the serial interrupt but as the timer and the serial need
the same acknowledgement the serial irq got his ack always when the
timer triggerd.  Up to now that delay didn't stick out as the delay was
< 10ms.

done.  (But I reserve the right to evaluate the 64bit case and check how
worse the overhead is :-)
