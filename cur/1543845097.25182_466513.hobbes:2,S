For now, I only expect two kinds of structures :
One for the architectures which implements the MARK_JUMP optimisation and one
where they don't. Does it make sense to assume that each architecture will offer
the possibility to write a 1 byte offset calculated from the difference between
two addresses ? If not, then, it can be useful to think of a per archtecture
structure, but module.c shall be modified accordingly too. So for now, I would
stay with only one definition in linux/marker.h and if we see the need for it,
we can put the structures in asm-*/marker.h and adapt module.c per architecture
accordingly (probably by using a macro).
