Type 'make config'. Make is clever enough to get the Makefile from SCCS for 
you. Add the missing dependencies to the Makefile so that make will fetch 
stuff like scripts/Configure before trying to run it, etc. 
Making it get all the Config.in files by parsing arch/$(ARCH)/config.in is
a fairly trivial task... but you do need to explicitly check out all the 
include directories, because we don't know how to deal with that yet. With 
kbuild-2.4, make dep won't work very well, but kbuild-2.5 ought to be OK 
with everything but the include files, I think.
Or you could just check it all out beforehand with bk -r co.
