It should stay in the private part of the in-core superblock of course.

With pagecache I meant the library of pagecache methods in buffer.c. Even
if they are recalled by the lowlevel filesystem code and they can be
overridden by lowlevel filesystem code, they aren't lowlevel filesystem code
but they're infact common code.  We can implement another version of them that
instead of knowing about get_block, also know about another filesystem
callback and when possible it only reserve the space for a delayed allocation
later triggered (in parallel) by future kupdate. They will know about this new
callback in the same way the current standard pagecache library methods knows
about get_block_t. Filesystems implementing this callback will be able to use
those new pagecache library methods.

Of course.
