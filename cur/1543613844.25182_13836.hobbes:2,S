  Hello!
   I'm suffering some problems last two days with (seems ext3)
   It happens both for 2.4.16 and 2.4.15 (I have not checked yet what
  happens with 2.4.17).
   The log I get is attached below, but seems that kjournald is trying
  to access beyond the device limits. This makes all access to that
  device impossible (even trying to umount it) and I have to reboot 
  the system. After that, the journal is played and all seems fine. 
  But after a while the error appears again. It seems that it has nothing
  to do with an concrete event, but some process trying to write
  something to disk (usually exim/procmail)
   The device that fails is a software RAID 5 device (/dev/md3) with
  three SCSI hard disks attached to an adaptec UW controller 19160.
   I have another 3 raid devices (RAID 5 and RAID 0 levels), which have
  not suffered any problem at the moment. I have also other RAID 0
  device with reiserfs.
   Anyway, currently I have returned to ext2 in all my devices for
  safety (this is a production server)
   The modules I have loaded are:
    Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
    ipt_MASQUERADE          1248   1  (autoclean)
    iptable_nat            12884   0  (autoclean) [ipt_MASQUERADE]
    ip_conntrack           13324   1  (autoclean) [ipt_MASQUERADE
    iptable_nat]
    ip_tables              10560   4  [ipt_MASQUERADE iptable_nat]
    nfsd                   66624   8  (autoclean)
    lockd                  48288   1  (autoclean) [nfsd]
    sunrpc                 59604   1  (autoclean) [nfsd lockd]
    reiserfs              148448   1  (autoclean)
    ne2k-pci                5056   1
    8390                    6016   0  [ne2k-pci]
    3c59x                  24968   1
   I also can send you my configure file if you need it.
   Also, if you need any other info, please e-mail me. I have the
   SysRQ+T and the SysRQ+P log just after the failure.
     Thank you
