Whenever vmalloc is called, it calls set_pgdir to add any new pgdir entries to 
all process page tables.
I blindly copied it from include/asm-i386 to include/asm-um, and the following 
happened to me:
	vmalloc is called when swap is turned on
	it allocates some memory, allocates a page for ptes, adds that page to 
		the kernel page table, and calls set_pgdir to update all of
		the process page tables similarly
	one of those processes exits
	exit_mmap frees the process page table, including the one representing
		the kernel vm entry
	that page gets reallocated for some other purpose
	the kernel page table is now corrupted
So, I have two questions:
	What does it mean to have kernel vm entries in process page tables?  Are
		processes mapping kernel memory?
	Why doesn't the above scenario happen on i386?
