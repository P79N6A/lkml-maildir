Well aparently lilo compile breaks w/ 2.2.? ive only tried this on 2.2.3.
I would toss a bit of the compile in, but I wont. Suffice it to say.
Lilo 21 doesnt compile under 2.2.3.

        A manager went to his programmers and told them: "As regards to
your work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and
leave at five in the afternoon."  At this, all of them became angry and several
resigned on the spot.
        So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own
working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule."  The
programmers, now satisfied, began to come in a noon and work to the wee
hours of the morning.
