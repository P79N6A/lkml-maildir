Hello Stephen, Andrew,
I have recently moved the async_tx git tree to kernel.org.
For linux-next please add:
    master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djbw/async_tx.git next
For -mm please replace the 'git-md-accel' url with the following, it
should also be renamed to 'git-async-tx' as anything that impacts MD
will go through Neil.
    master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djbw/async_tx.git upstream
Currently both trees contain the following:
Dan Williams (7):
      fsldma: do not cleanup descriptors in hardirq context
      dmaengine: fix sparse warning
      ioat: fix 'ack' handling, driver must ensure that 'ack' is zero
      async_tx: checkpatch says s/__FUNCTION__/__func__/g
      async_tx: fix multiple dependency submission
      async_tx: kill ->device_dependency_added
      iop-adma: remove the workaround for missed interrupts on iop3xx
Zhang Wei (1):
      dmaengine: add driver for Freescale MPC85xx DMA controller
Regards,
Dan
