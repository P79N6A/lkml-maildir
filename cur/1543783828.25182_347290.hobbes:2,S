Subject: [patch] i386 seccomp fix for auditing/ptrace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
This is the same issue as ppc64 before, when returning to userland we
shouldn't re-compute the seccomp check or the task could be killed
during sigreturn when orig_eax is overwritten by the sigreturn syscall.
This was found by Roland.
This was harmless from a security standpoint, but some i686 users
reported failures with auditing enabled system wide (some distro
surprisingly makes it the default) and I reproduced it too by keeping
the whole workload under strace -f.
Patch is tested and works for me under strace -f.
nobody@athlon:~/cpushare> strace -o /tmp/o -f python seccomp_test.py
make: Nothing to be done for `seccomp_test'.

The malicious bytecode has been killed successfully by seccomp

The seccomp_test.py completed successfully, thank you for testing.
Thanks.
