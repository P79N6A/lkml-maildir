It is a shame we can't use "struct pid*" lockless, note that "struct pid"
itself is rcu-protected. I hope we can find another usage for put_pid_rcu
(in fact I suggested it before, but didn't have a reason). However, I don't
see any other example immediately.

Yes, this is possible, and probably we should do just this.

I don't think this is good. It was converted from task_struct* to pid*.
Eric, what do you think?
