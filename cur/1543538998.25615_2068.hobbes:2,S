So you didn't read my last replies to your email at all?
When we're OUT OF MEMORY, there is NO MEMORY LEFT to even get
information from /proc. Well, in some cases there may be memory
left, but in other cases there isn't so you can't operate on
that assumption.
Let me repeat myself: NO MEMORY LEFT. NADA. ZILCH. NOTHING.
In that case no userspace "solution" will be able to get the
relevant info from /proc and make a sane choice as to which
process to kill. That is why an OOM killer has to be in the
kernel (which, incidentally, is where my OOM killer patch runs).
regards,
Rik
