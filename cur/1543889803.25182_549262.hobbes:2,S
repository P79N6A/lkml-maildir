Agreed. I am optimistic that we can achieve good degree of SMP
fairness using similar mechanism as smpnice ..

sure, although the more levels of hierarchy scheduler recoginizes, more
the (accounting/scheduling) cost is!

Yeah I agree that providing hierarchical group-fairness at the cost of single 
(or fewer) scheduling levels would be a nice thing to target for,
although I don't know of any good way to do it. Do you have any ideas
here? Doing group fairness in a single level, using a common rb-tree for tasks 
from all groups is very difficult IMHO. We need atleast two levels.
One possibility is that we recognize deeper hierarchies only in user-space,
but flatten this view from kernel perspective i.e some user space tool
will have to distributed the weights accordingly in this flattened view
to the kernel.

Good point. Essentially all users should get fair cpu first, then all
sessions/pgrps under a user should get fair share, followed by
process-groups under a session, followed by processes in a
process-group, followed by threads in a process (phew) .. ?
The container patches by Paul Menage at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/27/146
provide a generic enough mechanism to group tasks in a hierarchical
manner for each resource controller. For ex: for the cpu controller, if the 
desired fairness is as per the above scheme (user/session/pgrp/threads etc), 
then it is possible to write a script which creates such a tree under cpu
controller filesystem:
	# mkdir /dev/cpuctl
	# mount -t container -o cpuctl none /dev/cpuctl
/dev/cpuctl is the cpu controller filesystem which can look like this:
	/dev/cpuctl
		|----uid root
		|       |-- sid 10
		|	|      |------ pgrp 20
		| 	|      | 	  |-- process 100
		|	|      |          |-- process 101
		|	|      |          |
		|       |
		|	|-- sid 11
		|
		|--- uid guest
(If the cpu controller really supports those many levels that is!)
user scripts can be written to modify this filesystem tree upon every 
login/session/user creation (if that is possible to trap on). Essentially it 
lets this semantics (what you ask) be dynamic/tunable by user.

Thanks for this list of tests. I intend to run all of them if possible
for my next version.
