The only thing on the stack is the regs, thus no backtrace.
Someone modified entry.S and added code just before the sysexit.  There is
no 'sysenter_exit' in stock 2.6.16 for one, and there's new code before
the sysexit:
   3:   e8 81 ca 03 00            call   3ca89 <_EIP+0x3ca89> <== new
   8:   fb                        sti                       <== new
   9:   8b 4d 08                  mov    0x8(%ebp),%ecx
   c:   66 f7 c1 ff fe            test   $0xfeff,%cx
  11:   0f 85 4e 01 00 00         jne    165 <_EIP+0x165>
  17:   e8 ed ea 00 00            call   eb09 <_EIP+0xeb09> <== new
  1c:   8b 44 24 18               mov    0x18(%esp),%eax <== new
  20:   8b 54 24 28               mov    0x28(%esp),%edx
  24:   8b 4c 24 34               mov    0x34(%esp),%ecx
  28:   31 ed                     xor    %ebp,%ebp
  2a:   fb                        sti
   0:   0f 35                     sysexit    <===== oops
But that doesn't explain the oops.  Maybe the SYSENTER MSR got screwed up?
