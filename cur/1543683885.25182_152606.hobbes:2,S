This is sort of what interactivity bonus is all about, although
on a more general level.  I.e. app wait for io, io
happens, app wakes up with priority bonus which it may use for processing
the io or start another one.
This goes for sound, graphichs, and ordinary disk file io.
There is no explicit connection between sound drivers and
processes - the processes get the bonus because they waited for
the io (in this case sound) to happen.  Explicit connections
of this kind is hard to set up, because there may be several
processes using the sound device, or even several sound devices.
Even more so for graphichs - lots of processes use the same display.
If you care more about sound than  anything else, run your
sound apps at higher priority than other processes.
