I personally think that it's not a difficult choice at all. Please don't
even consider doing it. At the moment, I post through my ISP's relay, but when
they are having trouble, I deliver direct. Sometimes when I'm using my laptop
on someone else's connection it's quicker to deliver direct than reconfig to
use their gateway.
I know _my_ postings to l-k aren't exactly rocket science, but I'm sure there
are others out there who would be really put out by this. There's also a
security issue -- going through a gateway is a potential point for someone to
read your mail.
Spam is definitely a pain, but taking measures to block it which inconvenience
legitimate users is - in a way - letting the spammers win. I oppose invalid
e-mail addresses in Usenet From: lines for the same reason.
As for not allowing posts from non-subscribers, I don't have a definitive
position, but a couple of points / ideas:
i) we do get a lot of cruft from people reporting bugs days or weeks after
they've been fixed, just because they don't read l-k and therefore haven't
seen the discussion about it.
ii) How about creating a `null' linux-kernel-posters list, which never sends
mails to subscribers, but only subscribers to it can post to l-k? To save
inconveniencing the regulars, the list could be pre-stuffed with people who
have posted over the last N weeks.
