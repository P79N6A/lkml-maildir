I looked around a bit with grep -R and a few search terms but didn't
find something definite.  Is there any other user of a crc16_itu_t or
crc_ccitt or whatever which operates on a (CPU byte ordered) u32[]
instead of on a (network byte ordered) u8[]?
The only value in having a shared implementation would be a potentially
smaller kernel.  Sharing it to ensure correctness is not an issue;
fw-topology.c::crc16_itu_t is simply the one in IEEE 1212 table 5.
Performance is also not an issue (if better algorithms exist) because
the FireWire stack uses it only infrequently on a moderate amount of data.
