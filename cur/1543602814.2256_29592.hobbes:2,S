Subject: 2.4.10 problem with APM on Inspiron 8000

My Inspiron 8k loves kernels 2.4.* up to 2.4.9, but has problems with 2.4.10.
In particular, it seems that any APM event (suspend, etc.) causes a hard
freeze.  In fact, on 2.4.9 and lower, I can even use the function-setup key
which lets me examine/change bios while the kernel is running.  On 2.4.10,
this causes a kernel freeze.
My .config files are essentially identical for 2.4.9 and for 2.4.10.
On thing I noticed that seems a little suspicious is this start up message:
    Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling.
    Found and enabled local APIC!
For 2.4.9, I get:
    mapped APIC to ffffe000 (01442000)
Both kernels print:
    apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.14)
    ...
    ACPI: APM is already active, exiting
