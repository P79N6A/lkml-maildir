Hi,
	if drivers in the tree still compile (and work) after 	removing
some #include -s does it mean that they don't need them at all?
	May they fail to compile on other arch -s ?
     For instance vgacon.c  includes among others fs.h which it seems
never to use.I could send a patch for it.
Are these frequent in the tree?
