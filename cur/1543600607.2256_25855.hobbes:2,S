I am not sure what module problem you are talking about.  There was a
bug in my original patch that caused a link error in most situations
where CONFIG_MODULE was set, but this had to do with
atomic_dec_and_lock, not preempt_xxx -- what preempt_xxx symbols?
Anyhow, I suggest you grab 2.4.9-ac10 and
http://tech9.net/rml/linux/patch-rml-2.4.9-ac10-preempt-kernel-1
 and
enable CONFIG_PREEMPT and give that a whirl.  You should have no
problems on a UP system.

Very glad.  Especially to hear there are no problems on Athlon.

Great.  Data points such as this are welcome.  What about the actual
throughput?  Both I and Nigel (see 
http://kpreempt.sourceforge.net
) 
benched the patch with `dbench -16' and we both got decent throughput
increase.
