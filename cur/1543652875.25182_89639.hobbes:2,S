I use SuSE 8.1 ( kernel 2.4.19-4GB) and a program with semaphores.
It runs okay on many PCs and laptops except one laptop (with Pentium
Mobile).
Every semaphore function (semget(),..) ,  "ipcs -s" ... results in
"uninterruptable sleep".
The processes cannot be killed by kill -9.
cat /proc/sys/kernel/sem returns   250  256000  32 1024 
I always use the default kernel without special configurations.
What can I do ??
Thanks for your help,
Josef
