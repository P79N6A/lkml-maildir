"very little support" seems excessively positive to me given that even RHEL3
(which, notwithstanding its progressing outdatedness, is incredibly more recent
than RH9) gained SATA support in its last update only (update 7),
IOW only RHEL4 has good SATA support (I'm not even sure whether its
initial release had it).
Why I know all this? Been there, done that... (piggybacked RHEL3 non-update-7
SATA install via Debian master boot)
So yes, RH9 is DEAD, especially when playing with SATA hardware, deal with it.
