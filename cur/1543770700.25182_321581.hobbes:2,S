People routinely post "Why does this cheap IDE drive outperform my shiny new
high end SCSI drive?" questions to the postgres mailing list. To which people
point out the IDE numbers they've presented are physically impossible for a
7200 RPM drive and the SCSI numbers agree appropriately with an average
rotational latency calculated from whatever speed their SCSI drives are.

Well guaranteeing write order will at least mean the database isn't complete
garbage after a power event.
It still means lost transactions, something that isn't going to be acceptable
for any real-life business where those transactions are actual dollars.
