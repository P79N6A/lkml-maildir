I resisted playing devils advocate yesterday, but I just cant do it
anymore :-)  Does anyone want to speculate as to how many feature
freezes we will have this time around?  Historically the kernel
release cycle has been an interesting process.  I remember jumping
to version 0.95 because 1.0 was really close, maby even ready by
Christmas....

PS: Please dont take this as a criticism of anybody.  I certainly couldnt
    do any better.  Its just funny to remember all the times we have done
    this before and how it has always worked out.
