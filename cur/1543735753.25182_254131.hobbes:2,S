I don't think the requirement is so much to be able to dynamically change
policies while the system is running, I think that the requirement is to be
able to set the global policy at boot time or near then.  We don't want to
have to recompile the kernel to boot it for a webserver or fileserver (likely 
local page cache allocation) versus an HPC system (likely round robin
page cache allocation policy).
The rationale for the local policy is partially implementation (see below),
and thinking that even on your big HPC system, some processes in some cpusets
might be running a file server application, and they would want local
allocation.  Having said that, of course, begs the question as to whether we
need a per cpuset policy, I suppose.  But read on for the implemenation
argument, and if that is not persuasive, then I'll go with a global only
policy and see where that leads.

Bill,
That would capture most of our requirements, I think.  Part of the reason
for doing a global and local policy is that is the way that the code works 
now, and all I did was piggyback on that.  So, because there is a global
policy with a per process override for the existing page allocation policy,
you get a similiar structure for the page cache policy.
The overhead is an additional word per task structure, an additional
mempolicy copy (if there is a per process page cache allocation policy)
and structure, plus some code that looks like this in alloc_pages_by_policy():
struct page *
alloc_pages_by_policy(unsigned gfp, unsigned order, unsigned policy)
  {
        struct mempolicy *pol;
        if (policy >= NR_MEM_POLICIES)
                BUG();
        pol = current->mempolicy[policy];
        if (!pol)
                pol = default_policy[policy];
. . .
Som it is elegant that way and readily allows for additional memory
allocation cases (slab cache, anyone?).

Yes, it is getting a little out of hand.  However, if we can get by without
the MEMPOL_ROUNDROBIN, we are back to where we were there.
