Can you please explain why this can't be done in userspace?  In fact
all existing suspend solutions seem to be doing fine doing things like
this in userspace.

No need to cast kmalloc return values, and please split assignments and
conditionals into separate lines.

NACK.  emergency_remount is exactly what it sais and should never ever
be used for a system that you want to keep on using later on.  If you
look at it's implementation it's not correct and can't serve as more than
a bandaid for susrq.  In fact we should probably just remove it..

And something like this for sure should not be exported.

ditto.
