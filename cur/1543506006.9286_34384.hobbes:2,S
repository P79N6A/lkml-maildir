Guys (Gals?),
I THINK, but do not know for sure, that sw raid was finally upgraded to
0.90 for the 2.2.12pre1 (at least it is in 2.2.12pre4 that I'm
running).  I think you need to translate your mdtab into a raidtab
file.  Different syntax.  Much better features.  You may need to
"upgrade" your current raid disks to the new format.  A backup would be
handy...
(I've been waiting FOREVER to get the raid 0.90 into the "official"
kernel every since I discovered that RedHat put the "alpha" 0.90 in
their kernel releases for RedHat 6.0.  Since there were not patches
released with each kernel revision it's been kindof a pain.  Thanks
Alan and Ingo for finally getting this in the official kernel.  Now all
I have to hope for is the VPN (PPTP and IPSEC) masquerading. 
Can/should I attempt to modify the patches so that they apply cleanly
to 2.2.12pre4?)
hth,
