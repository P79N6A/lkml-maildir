It's hard to know what to say about this.  The infrastructure for
scanning did move to separate scanned (old parallel and a few other)
busses from hotplug ones (which is what sbp2 is).  You really need to
look at the scan_finished and user_scan callbacks.  Unfortunately the
latter is a transport class function and how all the modern busses (FC,
SAS and the like do this).
