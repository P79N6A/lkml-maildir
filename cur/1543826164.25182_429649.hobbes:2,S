Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17-rc5 0/8] Kernel memory leak detector 0.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a new version (0.4) of the kernel memory leak detector. See
the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more detailed
description. The patches are downloadable from (the bundled patch or
the full series):
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patch-2.6.17-rc5-kmemleak-0.4.bz2
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patches-kmemleak-0.4.tar.bz2
What's new in this version:
- full kernel modules support
- kmemleak now depends on DEBUG_SLAB. The detection is improved by the
  objects poisoning caused by this configuration option
- freeing orphan pointers is no longer reported since these can be
  false positives
- replaced some _rcu list traversal loops with their normal or _safe
  form
To do:
- better testing
- test Ingo's suggestion on task stacks scanning
- NUMA support
- (support for ioremap)
