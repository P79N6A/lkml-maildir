in fact there was an unconditional qsort() done after scanning all tasks,
until i pointed it out to Alex. It never caused any problems, and sorting
never showed up as a source of overhead in the profiler, so i'm not sure
why you insist on sorting so much.
if procps hangs then that's a bug in procps. I'm not quite sure what you
mean by 'it hits a particular process'.
