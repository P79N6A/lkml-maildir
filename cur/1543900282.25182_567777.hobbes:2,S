I agree that people still use setserial that way, and we shouldn't
make this change because it would break things.
But I also agree with Yinghai that these extra phantom devices are
just weird.  It would be a lot nicer if there were a way to say,
"please, Mr. Serial Driver, create me a new ttyS device with these
parameters."
But no, I'm not volunteering to do that.
