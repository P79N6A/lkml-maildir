It's such a custom case that the other device
names didn't matter.

Let's do this, but design the code to
allow more by just changing a #define.

Maybe for a desktop or generic server where
you don't know what's going to be configured,
but it's not unusual to do so with custom
embedded systems.  The small experimental
or user allocations often don't cover what
is needed, so we just grab some allocation
from a device that isn't ever going to be
used on the system.
Thanks.
