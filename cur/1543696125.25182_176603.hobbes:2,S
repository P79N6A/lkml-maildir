After compiling kernel 2.4.22 I don't see HT feature.
dmsg output & messages from boot sequence are attached, as far as 2.4.20 
configuration which was succesful in identifying and using HT.
I am compiling kernels from times of version 0.9. And starting from 2.4 kernels 
it become too cripting. Many new devices are not documented in an understandable
style. Specifically frame buffer parameters, i2o, i2c, agp, usb. 
configure.help mention CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING parameter which is not generated by
make menuconfig and menu xconfig and do nothing if inserted manually.
Can you also give me hints how to know if given PC has i2o or i2c buses? I'm 
using Sandra and Aida32 programs to explore hardware under Windows. By the way,
they shows that I have Intel 82801EB (ICH5) South Bridge and I'm not sure if
it's supported in Linux. Sound from this chipset is not supported for sure.
One more question: if chipset support ISA but mainboard don't have ISA slots, 
should I compile in a kernel ISA support or not?
Does it have sence to add new PCI device to PCI database if current kernel 
don't support this device?
Best regards, E.
