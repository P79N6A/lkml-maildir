Does anyone know exactly how big the window is from when a compiled in
console activates until one that relies on initramfs loads? I don't
think it is very big given that a lot of the early printk's are queued
before they are displayed.
Other than embedded systems, are there machines that have no BIOS/PROM
display at all and rely entirely on a bootable kernel for display? If
so, how do machines like this put up a message that they can't find
the kernel? How do you get hardware diagnostic messages from them?
In the case of something like a Mac you would want to keep the display
blank until the early user space code initializes the display in
graphics mode. Only if you get a fatal error before this would you
dump the info using the Open Firmware display. Same strategy would
apply to x86.
