Hmm.  How does the interaction work.  I've been meaning to track it for
a while but haven't yet.  
From the cases I have observed it seems to be connected with arp requests
that aren't answered. (I.e when something is misconfigured and you try to nfsroot off
of the wrong ip on your subnet)
And I keep thinking neighbour table underflow would have been a better message.
