Linux Trademark -- what are the rules for lawful use of the word "Linux" ?
Does Linus hold "the right to bust whomever I want" for any use of the
word "Linux" that he doesn't approve of, or has he declared a set of uses
that he does approve of ?
  Any pointers would be appreciated.
      thanx,
             Jan
