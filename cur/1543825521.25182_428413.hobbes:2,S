Because you have vgacon that knows nothing about your videocard, then
try to run 3D acceleration over it. Suspend/resume can't work properly
in such case... fbcon is pretty good for your stripped-down system,
too.
...and we do not want to support 1000 different configs, because then
they all become buggy.
