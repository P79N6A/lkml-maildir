Not really.
I see I/O jammed up on reiserfs:.text.lock.journal, but you said
reiserfs and ext3 both stall the same way.  If the journal is in the
raid, I'd try moving it, but I can't really imagine seek troubles
leading to 15 minutes of grinding.  I noticed that those last two
instances of bash got nailed because of atime.  Do things get any better
if mounted noatime, nodiratime?
