Like it or not, power management is far from trivial, and people
writing device drivers have limited resources. Calling them lazy
does not help that in the least. If you try to put pressure on them
by refusing to merge their work as long as it doesn't provide this
or that functionality, you *may* end up with a few drivers having
that functionality which otherwise wouldn't, but you *will* also
end up with a number of drivers never making it into the kernel
because their authors just have to give up.
Also, in your argument you neglected a few cases:
- What if my device does not require power management?
- What if I don't know whether my device requires power management?
- What if I know my device would require power management, but don't
  know how to implement it?

Exactly.

Your argument falls down the moment you consider the alternative:
not merging the driver means that the device won't work at all.
(Given that out-of-tree drivers are actively discouraged, to put
it mildly.) That's arguably farther from "desktop readiness" than
a device not supporting power management.
