I was able to constantly reproduce this problem on another machine with
1 cpu, and find the bug.  
In the ext3_new_blocks() code, if the # of allocated blocks (num) is
less than the requested # of blocks to allocate (*count), we will need
to free some quota via DQUOT_FREE_BLOCK(), which will eventually adjust
i_blocks value properly. the delta value *count-num is wrong, as we re-
set the *count too early.
The patch seems fixed the bug on my machine, could you please give it a
try?
Thanks.
