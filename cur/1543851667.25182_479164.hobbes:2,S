Ugh.  This simply changes NR_IRQS from 256 to 512.  Changing
the size of data from 1K to 2K.
So unless there is some other array that is sized by NR_IRQs
in the context switch path which could account for this in
other ways.  It looks like you just got unlucky.
The only hypothesis that I can seem to come up with is that maybe
you are getting an extra tlb now that you didn't use to.  
I think the per cpu area is covered by huge pages but maybe not.
