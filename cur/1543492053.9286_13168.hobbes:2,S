Subject: Q: using kmod to invoke a user application

Can someone point me to v2.2 technical documentation on the new kmod
mechanism (replacing kerneld)? I've seen Documentation/kmod.txt and
kmod.c, but need more info.
Specifically, my modularized net driver would like to invoke an app in
user space when it is _opened_. The app does some private ioctl()'s to
the driver (to download the NIC's firmware). Is there a way to have a
modularized driver invoke a user-mode program? (I am trying to avoid
bloating my driver with the downloadable NIC firmware. I'd like to load
the firmware during the open() procedure and stall the open until the
download completes. There is no FLASH on the NIC so the NIC firmware
must be downloaded every time it is initialized.)
Thanks
