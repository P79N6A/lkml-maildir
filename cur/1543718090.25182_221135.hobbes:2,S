No one asked the ia64 folks who did that work "Hey, have you looked at
the grand unified kgdb project on kgdb.sf.net ?" would be my guess.
Having said that, if you're willing to go with a slightly late
initalizing (I saw part of the early_param work get dropped again I
think, so I'm gonna guess you don't wanna deal with that again yet) KGDB
for i386 and PPC32, I can whip something up vs 2.6.6 in a day or so.
