There is plenty of justification all right.  Besides adding metadata 
versioning, they built it around an optimal binary-dff algorithm borrowed 
from Josh Macdonald's PRCS/Xdelta, so the version database is more compact 
and efficient than you can achieve with a diff or pure SCCS-based design.

For the long run, svn looks very good.  I've seen many pot shots aimed at it, 
but few survive scrutiny.  The ones that do are:
   - It's not quite here yet
   - It's not Linus-compatible
The second one will take longer to solve than the first. In the meantime, 
those who can't use Bitkeeper (that includes me, since I did some work on a 
versioning filesystem, never mind annoying Larry) need some tools in order to 
have any chance of keeping current with Linus and other maintainers.  The 
contributions of Andrea, Pavel and Rik in that area are extremely valuable, 
and I thank them for it.
Regards,
Daniel.
