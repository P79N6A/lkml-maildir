The simplest example that comes to my mind to explain the need is
through quality of service. Consider a single system running two
instances of an application (lets say a web portal or a database
sever). If one of the instances is production and the other is
development, and if the development instance is being stress tested -
how do I provide reliable quality of service to the users of the
production instance?
I am sure other people will probably have better examples.
