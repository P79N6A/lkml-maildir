The relation to UHCI probably has to do with ongoing DMA.  The amount
of DMA varies according to whether or not the USB devices are
suspended, whether or not they have drivers, and the speed at which 
they run.
You can test whether suspending the onboard USB devices changes 
anything.  See Documentation/usb/power-management.txt.
