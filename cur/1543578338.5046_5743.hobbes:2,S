I've seen exactly nil cases where there are any security holes in apps caused
by that pthreads api non adherance. There are also far too many overheads
imposed by implementing something in kernel space that is nearly useless,
not needed for any application 99.9999% of users (possibly 100%) have and can
be done just as well in the pthreads library glue - where it will only be
a penalty to pthread using apps.
Making everyone suffer for a bad standard corner case is bad. Especially when
the 'security hole' is pure FUD
