I quickly hacked this up and did a UP test build (patch at the end),
but there is another consequence to consider.
With this, we have to either:
1) Mark all IPI functions with ifdef CONFIG_SMP, or
2) Mark them with __attribute__((__unused__))) which is what
   the net/core/flow.c case does
Because if we just leave the static IPI functions there without the
CONFIG_SMP ifdef and without the unused attribute, this new
smp_call_function() will generate an unused static function warning.
What we could do is hide that detail behind some kind of
"DEFINE_IPI_FUNC()" macro, and put the gore into a header file.
I'm sure there are other clean ways of handling it.
