Maybe the MODE SENSE page cache is causing problems (known problem with
some USB storage devices), triggering the error (i.e. timeout) handler to
run, leading to the command being retried forever.
Turn on all scsi logging (you must be logging and booting over IDE, so
the following won't cause infinite logging):
sysctl -w dev.scsi.logging_level=0xffffffff
Also get a trace of the hung process via sysrq.
After you get that data, try removing sd_do_mode_sense() calls in sd.c to
see if MODE SENSE commands are causing problems.
You could also try using sg (sg_utils) to send a MODE SENSE page 8, and
see what happens.
