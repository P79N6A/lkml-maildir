Let me repeat what I said and you snipped:
If there is a security problem, then it should be solved in user space.
Some people actually use the console. They want to be able to reassign
CapsLock, set their own function keys, set dvorak keymap etc.
It is a bad idea to restrict that functionality to root.
There are a thousand things one can do to put the kernel keyboard/console
in an interesting state. The solution is to have init/getty/login reset
state to a useful initial state. Not to have the kernel forbid one
to change the settings of the very keyboard one is typing on.

Yes.

Didnt I show a "bleeding edge" patch some April 1st or so?
At least I had a red border on some console a few years ago.
The patch must still exist somewhere. I seem to recall that Paul Gortmaker
submitted a somewhat more general version.

marc.theaimsgroup.com tells me that the change was due to horms and akpm.
Let me cc them and see whether they have reasons why this had to be done
in kernel space.
