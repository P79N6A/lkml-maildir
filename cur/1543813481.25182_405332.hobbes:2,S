I think it makes sense to treat mapped pages separately because only
mapped pages require clearing of young-bits in pte:s. The logic for
unmapped pages could be driven entirely from mark_page_access(), no
scanning required. At least in my head that is. =)
Also, what might be an optimal page replacement policy for for
unmapped pages might be suboptimal for mapped pages.

Yeah, I know that. =) I think your ClockPRO work looks very promising.
I would really like to see some better page replacement policy than
LRU merged.

Yes, true. But this happens already with a per-zone LRU. LRU pages
that happen to end up in the DMA zone will probably stay there a
longer time than pages in the normal zone. That does not mean it is
right to break the page ordering though, I'm just saying it happens
already and the oldest piece of data in the global system will not be
reclaimed first - instead there are priorities such as unmapped pages
will be reclaimed over mapped and so on. (I strongly feel that there
should be per-node LRU:s, but that's another story)

I'm definitely interested, but I also believe that the page reclaim
code is hairy as hell, and that complicated changes to the "stable"
2.6-tree are hard to merge. So I see my work as a first step (or just
something that starts a discussion if no one is interested), and in
the end a page replacement policy implementation such as yours will be
accepted.
Thanks!
