i just added something ad-hoc. I wanted it to be accurate across
interrupt entries. I have not looked at the relayfs locking but how does
it solve that? Also, cli/sti makes it obviously SMP-safe and is pretty
cheap on all x86 CPUs. (Also, i didnt want to use preempt_disable/enable
because the tracer interacts with that code quite heavily.)
