Just because two things have name spaces and hierarchies, doesn't
make them interchangeable.  Name spaces and hierarchies are just
implementation mechanisms - many interesting, entirely unrelated,
solutions make use of them.
What are the objects named, and what is the relation underlying
the hierarchy?  These must match up.
The objects named in cpusets are subsets of a systems CPUs and Memory
Nodes. The relation underlying the hierarchy is the subset relation on
these sets: if one cpuset node is a descendent of another, then its
CPUs and Memory Nodes are a subset of the others.
What is the corresponding statement for CKRM?
For CKRM to subsume cpusets, there must be an injective map from the
above cpuset objects to CKRM objects, that preserves this subset
relation on cpusets.
