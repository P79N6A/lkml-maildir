    Hi, I have this chip on a MSI KT4 Ultra (KT400 and VT8235) and an 
Athlon 2400+.
I have noe the kernel 2.4.19 and all works fine, but 2.4.19 don't 
support this chip (so no DMA & Co) and I've decided to upgrade to 2.4.20 
to get it working.
I've compiled in the Debian Way ( kernel-package) and installed the 
kernel, then I've rebooted it.
During the startup progress it have initialized the HDs fine , but when 
he had reached the first CDROM ( a NEC DVD READER) it locked up with 
this message:
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: drive is not ready for command
ide1: reset: success!
and it repeats this messages in an infinite loop , I don't know how to 
solve this , there isn't a patch or something else?
The kernel that I've tried (without success) are:
kernel 2.4.20 (original)
kernel 2.4.20 -ac2
kernel-source-2.4.20 package by debian + patches
kernel-2.5.50-ac1(doesen't boot)
kernel-2.5.53 (doesen't compiles)
Please help
Thank u
Byez
