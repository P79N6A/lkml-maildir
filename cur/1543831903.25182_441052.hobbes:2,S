While working on some HAL issues I hit some not clear - to me at least - 
behavior. I was testing HAL Eject method that under Linux effectively 
calls 'eject /dev/block'. Now for USB stick - at least, that I have, this 
results in "ejecting medium" without apparently any way to get it back (the 
only way is to replug stick).

PHYSDEVDRIVER=sd
In this state I do see device:
{pts/0}% sudo sdparm -a /dev/sda
    /dev/sda:           128MB             2.00
{pts/0}% cat /proc/scsi/scsi
Attached devices:
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor:          Model: 128MB            Rev: 2.00
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
but any attempt to get partition back results in
{pts/0}% LC_ALL=C sudo blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sda
/dev/sda: No medium found
I tried 'sdparm -C start' without much success as well:
{pts/0}% LC_ALL=C sudo sdparm -v -C start /dev/sda
    /dev/sda:           128MB             2.00
    Start stop unit command: 1b 00 00 00 01 00
{pts/0}% LC_ALL=C sudo blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sda
/dev/sda: No medium found
Well, I just try to understand if this is a expected (and reasonable) 
behaviour or a bug in hardware or possibly software?
Thank you
