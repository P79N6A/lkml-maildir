This is discouraged. :)
Better, IMO, to compare behaviours with realistic queue depths. As you
know, more than 64 for hard disks does not make sense (yet).
Personnaly, I use 64 under FreeBSD and 16 under Linux. Guess why ? :-)

There is no BH in the driver. The stock sym53c8xx even uses scsi_obsolete
that requires more load in interrupt context for command completion.
SYM-2 that comes back from FreeBSD uses the EH threaded stuff that just
queues to a BH on completion. Stephan may want to give SYM-2 a try, IMO.

The sym* drivers also uses an internal data structure to handle I/Os. The
SCSI script does not know about any O/S specific data structure.

Agreed.
