we return -ENOIOCTLCMD if we didn't have a valid compat ioctl, and in
that case the vfs code will try to find it in the core translation
table.

I'm not sure moving everything from fs/compat_ioctl.c is a good idea.
Everything that is just in a single driver or subsystem that has
common ioctl code - sure.  else it doesn't make a lot of sense.
