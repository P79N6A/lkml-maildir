Right, it does not matter, we just need to be able to fnmatch()
modalias and the string in the module.
We prefer every modalias to be prefixed with the subsystem, to be able
to hook userspace configs into the alias processing. The string itself
is completely up to the subsystem to decide whatever fits. If there
could ever be several types of strings per susbsystem, it is usual to
prefix the string with some character, but some subsystems know that
this is not needed, and just put a plain single string there.
