If we decide to remove the file, I would rather go through deprecation of the
file with filing an entry in feature-remove-schedule. There still seems to be
some users of the file.
With deprecation done with sth. like
#ifndef __KERNEL__
#warning Don't include this file from userspace, it's emtpy.
#endif
