I'm wondering more and more why you choose the GPL and not the BSD 
licence for the Linux kernel...
Companies are violating the GPL and this only works as long as noone 
starts taking legal actions against them.
And taking legal actions easily takes all of your fortune at risk.

And there are some companies for whom it's better if they can take the 
open source code and turn it into some closed thing. There's a reason 
why TiVo warned it's investors that the GPLv3 might hurt their business.

And what are the risk of your allies actions?
Consider e.g. that your ally AMD offers legally questionable non-GPL 
modules and Debian shipping binaries.
If one of the many copyright holders of the kernel wants to take legal 
actions against this suing AMD might simply be out of reach due to 
financial reasons.
But legal actions against the maintainers of ftp.<your_country>.debian.org 
distributing binaries of these legally questionable modules have a good 
chance of success.
The legal risks might not be a problem for a big company like AMD, but 
anyone seeking an easy legal win will _naturally_ attack mirrors.
And considering the lucratice "cease and desist letter" business in 
Germany, it really seems to be only a matter of time until mirrors will 
have to pay (the lawyer costs of the ones sending the cease and desist 
letters) for the actions of your "allies".

Look at AMD.
Look at NVIDIA.
Will they ever switch from providing illegal modules to open source?

Until someone starts to attack ftp mirrors and other people distributing 
the questionable code.
There are so many copyright holders of the Linux kernel (including e.g. 
the former Caldera), and if someone wants to spread fear among Linux 
users legal actions against people maintaining ftp mirrors or selling 
their old Linux distribution at ebay will be the cheap and effective way 
to achieve this goal.
