Yep. These holes are what I have in mind, and random other things
like the !(bad_ppro && page_kills_ppro(pfn)) check.

Well, as far as I had been able to gather, ioremap is trying to
ensure it does indeed only hit one of these holes, and not valid
RAM. I thought the fact that it *won't* bail out when encountering
kernel text or remap_pfn_range'ed pages was only due to PG_reserved
being the proverbial jack of all trades, master of none.
I could be wrong here though.
But in either case: I agree that it is probably not a great loss
to remove the check, although considering it will be needed for
swsusp anyway...
