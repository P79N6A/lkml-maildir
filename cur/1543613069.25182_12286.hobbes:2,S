Subject: [PATCH] cciss 2.5.0 for 2.5.1-pre9
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/12/11/92

Here's a patch for the cciss driver in the 2.5.1-pre8 tree
(patch also applies to 2.5.1-pre9):
http://geocities.com/dotslashstar/cciss_2.5.0_for_2.5.1-pre8.txt
This patch:
* adds support for SCSI tape drives. 
* adds support for dynamically adding and removing      
  logical volumes on the fly.
I can't include this patch inline for a variety of reasons:
(it's too big, Mozilla pukes when I try to paste it into yahoo mail,
My Compaq MS mail account seems to insist on mangling whitespace, 
etc.  Sorry.)
Variants of this patch have been submitted before with little or 
no response.  Perhaps it's too big.  Perhaps it does 2 things,
and so is unacceptable.  Perhaps a hybrid scsi/block driver is
just too weird.  Perhaps it was just too weird and big for 2.4, but
maybe it's ok for 2.5.   In any case, here is the patch, rearing
its head again. :-)
Enjoy, and thanks.
