Looks promising. But it's not going to be merged because of objections by
the cryptoapi maintainer.

It's not a patch, it's an add-on. I'm working on a gas version of the
assembler code so it can be merged, but it's far from being complete
(although it works).

Well that's the cost of an assembler implementation ;) it's not portable. 
Probably you can one of IBM's compilers to compile the cipher of your
choice.

 ... Rumours say
they're fast than gcc.
