This is a kernel module to allow real-time synchronization of connection
tracking tables between two linux routers. It will be useful for people willing
to achieve high availability of stateful firewalls, or NAT routers. It's our
first attempt at kernel hacking, so there is probably many errors and things to
fix, but it Works For Us (TM). you can even test it without recompiling your
kernel. see attached README file for the gory details. You would be so kind to
cc: us when replying ! :)
