I don't know much of anything about usb-serial, but I'll take a whack at 
it. Could you enable debug for that driver, launch apcupsd, and report 
any intersting messages that show up in dmesg? I'd be especially 
interested in any "Not setting..." or "Not writing..." messages, because 
some critical-looking code for baud rate setting and similar became 
conditional in 2.6.22.1 whereas it was always executed before. Apcupsd 
is going to be rather unhappy if the baud rate doesn't change when it 
asks. The debug should show if the these operations are being ignored on 
your hw.
