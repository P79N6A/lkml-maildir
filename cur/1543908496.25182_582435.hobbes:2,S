Subject: DRBD - what is it, anyways? [compare with e.g. NBD + MD raid]

sorry, I did not have the time to "beautify" our code base further,
so still no patch submission for the in-depth review. looking at my
schedule, this probably has to wait for september at the very least
 :(
meanwhile, please, anyone interessted,
the drbd paper for LinuxConf Eu 2007 is finalized.
http://www.drbd.org/fileadmin/drbd/publications/drbd8.linux-conf.eu.2007.pdf
it does not give too much implementation detail (would be inapropriate
for conference proceedings, imo; some paper commenting on the source
code should follow).
but it does give a good overview about what DRBD actually is,
what exact problems it tries to solve,
and what developments to expect in the near future.
so you can make up your mind about
 "Do we need it?", and
 "Why DRBD? Why not NBD + MD-RAID?"
thanks,
	Lars
