Well spotted, this is definitely a huge bug in the driver.
However, I think on closer examination that DTD_IN actually means
transfer from device to host, so DMA_FROM_DEVICE is correct for that
case.  It should be DMA_TO_DEVICE in the else if() piece.
Could you correct and resend the patch and I'll apply it.
Thanks,
James
