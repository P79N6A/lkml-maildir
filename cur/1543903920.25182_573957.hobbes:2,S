um.
I'm OK with merging patches and given lguest's newness, the timestamp on
these patches, the fact that they don't change code generation (right?) and
my reluctance to carry large do-nothing patches for two months, I'd be OK
with squeaking them into 2.6.23.
But I worry that you're proposing adding what appears to be new
Documentation-related machinery and infrastructure when there's already
increased activity in that area from other people and we might all be
headed in different directions and stuff.
So first I think we'd best form a kernel kommittee and mull this for a
while (preferably months) to screw you around as much as poss, OK?  ;)
Items for consideration would be:
- if this stuff is good, shouldn't other code be using it?  If so, is
  this new infrastructure in the correct place?
- if, otoh, this infrastructure is _not_ suitable for other code, well,
  what was wrong with it?
- if the requirement is good, perhaps alternative implementations should
  be explored (dunno what).
IOW, I'd be interested in hearing Rob and Randy's opinions on it all,
please.
