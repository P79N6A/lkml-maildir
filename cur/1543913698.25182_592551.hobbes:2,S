Let's step back a moment and consider the actual scale and impact of the 
problem at hand.
The vast majority of users are consumers of pre-compiled kernels, built 
by People With Clue(tm), who figured this stuff out as soon as it was 
introduced.
The current setup expresses the dependencies as they exist -- OPTIONAL 
extras, and that is a problem once a year or so, when someone builds 
their own kernel but must learn this fact anew.
There is simply no compelling need at all to change things from the 
current setup.
Our Kconfig system is for people who already know the kernel, not Aunt 
Tillie.
