I can't even find the docs for their "tcc".  Their "tchk" appears to  
have a "#pragma longlong type allow" or something, so I'd imagine the  
same exists for tcc and would be required to build stuff using kernel  
headers.  On the other hand, their compiler looks so immature that it  
does not appear to be worth spending much time worrying about now.   
When somebody shows up with a solution for that compiler then we can  
look at it at that time.
Cheers,
