Btw, this does depend on the fact that a regular "kmem_cache_create()" 
with a alignment of 0 had better return a pointer that is always "aligned 
enough" for the architecture in question. 
But that had better be true anyway, since otherwise everything would 
basically have to specify the alignment by hand, and the alignment of 0 
would be useless.
