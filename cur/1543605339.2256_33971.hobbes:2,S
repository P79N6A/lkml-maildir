actually, it seems on my system, if my system goes to sleep (haven't 
played around with it enough to figure out how to prevent that from 
happening), it seems to crash on "wakeup" if I use the xircom_tulip_cb, 
while the xircom_cb doesn't have that problem.
other thing is, xircom_tulip_cb used to work on my system (2.4.10) (xircom 
realport card, rebranded for IBM), but with 2.4.12-ac3, it can't seem to 
drive the card.  it loads fine, detects the card, but no blinky lights. 
<shrug/>
if it doesn't need promiscious mode always, shouldn't this be a module 
param?
thanks,
shaya
