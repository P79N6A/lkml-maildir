Hmmm, it seems to me that it is primarily *Intel* that is hurting Sun
by taking away their low end.  If the Sun gear was competitive on
price/performance at the low end, Wall St would still be buying Sun
boxes and would still be running Solaris on them.
At the high end Sun is also having big problems being competitive,
of course, but that has nothing to do with Linux.  Basically the
ultrasparc is about the slowest general purpose microprocessor in
current production, and that's got to hurt.
Paul.
