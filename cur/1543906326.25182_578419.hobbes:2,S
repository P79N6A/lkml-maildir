The issue is that you can actually kill hardware by setting this wrong.
We've had such cases where trip point problems eventually lead
to overheated laptops with hard disks dying etc. 
Also it runs the system out of spec and is similar to overclocking
which we also do not support.

I don't think it's that unreasonable to require source code modifications
for anything that can kill hardware. At least that raises the barrier
a bit and hopefully ensures people think twice about it and then really
only blame themselves if anything goes wrong.
