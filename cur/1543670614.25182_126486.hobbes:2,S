Subject: build failure due to scripts/modpost.c compile error since 2.5.67

2.5.67 and .68 don't build on RH6.2 / glibc-2.1.3 / i386.
The initial 'make oldconfig' results in:
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=scripts
  gcc -Wp,-MD,scripts/.modpost.o.d -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer   -c -o scripts/modpost.o scripts/modpost.c
scripts/modpost.c: In function `handle_modversions':
scripts/modpost.c:302: `STT_REGISTER' undeclared (first use in this function)
scripts/modpost.c:302: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
scripts/modpost.c:302: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [scripts/modpost.o] Error 1
make: *** [scripts] Error 2
2.5.67 added a check for a SPARC-specific elf thingy (STT_REGISTER)
in modpost.c and include/linux/elf.h. However, script/modpost.c
#includes glibc's elf.h not the kernel's. Older glibcs don't have
this constant, resulting in a compile error.
#ifndef STT_REGISTER at the offending code in modpost.c works
around the problem, but I assume the real fix is to make modpost.c
#include from the kernel's include dir instead.
