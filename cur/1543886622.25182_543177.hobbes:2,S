In the same way that enable_irq() and disable_irq() must be matched,
and for the same reasons:  when the IRQ is shared between drivers,
they can't all treat enable/disable status as boolean.  Those calls
mask refcountig.

Yes ... runtime warnings flagging various misbehaviors associated
with refcount mismatches.
