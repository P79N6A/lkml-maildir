Do you have both IEEE1284 and FIFO (CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO) compiled
into the kernel?  The parport code changed in 2.3.10 and I know it broke
interrupt-driven printing for me with only FIFO.  I added IEEE1284
support and SYSCTL(don't know if this makes a difference) and was able
to print normally in 2.3.10, 2.3.11, and 2.3.13.  It still doesn't work
for me in 2.3.12.  I didn't have any problems with text files; my print
jobs would just hang forever printing graphics.
As always, YMMV

the Spirit of God.  We have not received the spirit of the world but the
Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given
us.
