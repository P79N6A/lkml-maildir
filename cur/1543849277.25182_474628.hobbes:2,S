The problem is this workaround doesn't fix a chipset issue, it fixes
incorrect entries in the BIOS ACPI tables.  This bug existed in the
NVIDIA reference BIOS for nForce2 and got copied to all customer BIOSes
for nForce2.  Even though our reference BIOSes and documentation for all
chipsets since then have the correct interrupt overrides in the ACPI
tables we still see customer BIOSes that get shipped with incorrect
entries that were probably copied from their nForce2 BIOS code.
I believe the HPET check was because the workaround was causing problems
when enabling HPET on systems that support it.  Andy probably has more
details on that.
