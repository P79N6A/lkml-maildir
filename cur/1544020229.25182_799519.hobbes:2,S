I take this as a motivation to give a status of my current work.
My git repo[1] has a branch rt-master that is regularily rebased on
Steven's linux-rt/master branch.  This is my working branch.  Currently
all ARM defconfigs but clps7500, msm and omap_2430sdp can be build
without error after enabling PREEMPT_RT.  (I have a script to build all
these configs.  If someone wants it, just ask for it.)
That branch has some netx related patches as this is my current
platform.
Currently booting my machine results in two BUGs:
	...

I havn't looked into these issues yet, but will do now.
If someone has questions (or even can and wants to help) you can reach
me by mail or on #linux-rt when online.
