I can't speak about the irq routing issue, but I'm interested in your
issues with the ACPI PM timer.

So keeping the above settings, does removing just the "clock=tsc" cause
the sluggishness to appear?
The TSC is *much* faster then the ACPI PM, however it is just not usable
for reliable timekeeping on many SMP systems. That said, the ACPI PM
should not cause performance issues unless you are constantly calling
gettimeofday().
Also would you open a bugzilla bug on this and attach your .config and
dmesg?
thanks
