I wonder where the information got lost...  I miss docs on submitting
patches from git ONLY.  The general documentation is pretty good and
helpful, just doesn't treat git (not using git in general, but using
it for submitting patches to the Linux kernel).  On the other hand
there's a multitude of repositories to clone times a zillion branches
to follow.  Which should be the basis of the patches?  That's not very
clear.
Anyway, find them in my previous mails.  Too bad I realised just after
the fact that cosmetic changes should go first.  Hope it's mostly OK.
