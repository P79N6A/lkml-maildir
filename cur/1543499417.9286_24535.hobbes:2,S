Exactly. This demonstrates the silliness of the "policy" argument.
The kernel always has and always will dictate some policy. And we've
always been able to build a structure on top of that which follows a
different policy. Devfs+devfsd actually makes that easier.
And there's a lot to be said for the kernel providing a decent,
human-friendly policy that is guaranteed to be there. It allows
portable programmes to be written, without having to worry about what
a particular distribution maintainer has put in /dev.
With devfs+devfsd a distribution can provide a structure which they
think is logical and works well for them, and get compatibility for
free.
