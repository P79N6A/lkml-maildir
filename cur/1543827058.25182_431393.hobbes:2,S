I'm not arguing against you - I'm arguing with you.
I just tried to explain what you saw as "surprising" - the fact that ext3 
developers don't see this as a problem at all. They don't see it as a 
problem, because it's how they have always worked, since before ext3 was 
ext3, and it was just a crazy extension to ext2.
And yes, it's a serious problem. Ext3 is pretty damn messy. It's not as 
messy as some, but it sure has potential.
