Ok. I have started implementing your idea. But the implementation is no
simple.  Its becomes a complex mess. Atleast in the case of pnode
datastructure implementation, the propogation was all abstracted and
concentrated in the pnode datastructure. 
Here is a sample implementation of do_make_slave() with your idea. 
static int do_make_slave(struct vfsmount *mnt)
{
        int err=0;
        struct vfsmount *peer_mnt;
        spin_lock(&vfspnode_lock);
        if (!IS_MNT_SHARED(mnt)) {
                spin_unlock(&vfspnode_lock);
                err = -EINVAL;
                goto out;
        }
        peer_mnt = list_entry(mnt->mnt_share.next, struct vfsmount,
mnt_share);
        if (peer_mnt == mnt)
                peer_mnt = NULL;
        list_del_init(&mnt->mnt_share);
        if (peer_mnt) {
                /* move the slave list to the peer_mnt */
                list_splice(&mnt->mnt_slave, &peer_mnt->mnt_slave);
                list_add(&mnt->mnt_slave_list, &peer_mnt->mnt_slave);
                set_mnt_slave(mnt);
        } else {
                struct vfsmount *slave_mnt, *t_slave_mnt;
                list_for_each_entry_safe(slave_mnt, t_slave_mnt,
                                &mnt->mnt_slave, mnt_slave_list) {
                        CLEAR_MNT_SLAVE(slave_mnt);
                        list_del_init(&slave_mnt->mnt_slave_list);
                }
        }
        list_del_init(&mnt->mnt_slave);
        mnt->mnt_master = peer_mnt;
        spin_unlock(&vfspnode_lock);
out:
        return err;
}
Do you still believe that your idea is simpler? 
The most difficult part is, attaching shared vfs tree, which needs to be
attached at someother shared mount point. The problem here is while
traversing the propogation tree, one has to build another similar
propogation tree for the new child mount. Its a 2 dimensional tree walk,
i.e one walk is along the vfstree, and the other walk is along the pnode
tree for each mount.  Its much easier to abstract out the pnode
operations and concentrate on them separately than mixing the
functionality of vfs and pnode in a single vfs datastructure.
In my code, I have abstracted out the pnode tree traversing operation
using a single iterator function pnode_next().
Think about it, and let me know if it is worth the effort of changing
the implementation. I sincerely feel it just shifts complexity instead
of reducing complexity. I can eventually come up with a fully tested
implementation using your idea, but I am still not convinced that
it reduces complexity.
