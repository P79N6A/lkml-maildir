Infrastructure is not what matters when it comes to SMP
scalability on modern systems, since lock contention is
not the primary SMP scalability problem.
Due to the large latency ratio between L1/L2 cache and
RAM, the biggest scalability problem is cache invalidation
and cache bounces.
Those are not solvable by using another underlying
infrastructure - they require a reorganization of the
datastructures on top, the data structures in Linux.
Note that message passing is by definition less efficient
than SMP synchronisation mechanisms that do not require
data to be exchanged between CPUs, eg. RCU or the use of
cpu-local data structures.

SGI ?  IBM ?
