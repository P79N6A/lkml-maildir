Of course, userspace would have to use separate data structure. [Hash table?]

Well... for resume. If userspace does the allocation, it is:
userspace reads image
userspace relocates it
sys_atomic_restore(image)
if something goes wrong, userspace is clearly responsible for freeing
it.
How would you propose kernel<->user interface?
userspace reads pagedir
sys_these_pages_are_forbidden(pagedir)
userspace reads rest
sys_atomic_restore(image)
if something goes wrong, userspace must dealocate pages _and_ clear
forbidden flags?

Until someone will want to get page flag bits back ;-), ok.
