gcc logs:
	* expressions of form <....> can be reduced to cheaper form
	  by <....>.  Tested and merged.
gcc logs a year later:
	* revert commit <...>, it causes subtle problems (see PR<....>,
	  <....> and <....>).  Proposed replacement is too intrusive
	  for stable branch.
gcc logs a month later:
	* tested and merged the real fix for PR<....>; will go into the
	  next release.
foobar logs a year later:
	* gcc versions between <...> and <...> refuse to compile baz.c,
	  complain about non-constant index in initializer.  Waded through
	  the sewers of macros we have in barf.h and blah.h, found what
	  had been causing that.  Fixed.
Ain't fun...
