Hi!
A local ISP asked me to ask this question.
They have ~3500 users on a machine that had 128M
memory and they use quota on that machine.
They frequently get messages from random programs
that cannot fork. init, pop3d and other programs
appear in the logs complaining about this.
It happens with many kernelversions with quota
turned on. It does not happen with quota turned off.
They doubled the memory in that machine almost a week
ago and the errors haven't showed up since then.
The question is: is it normal? 128M is not enough
for quota against 3500 users? It should be documented
somewhere that kernel service X eats Y amount of memory
with Z number of users, at least some rough estimates.
Thanks,
Zoltan Boszormenyi
