I have.  And so has GPLv2, look:
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                         ^^^^

Trying to get you to see what is so obvious to me.

Red Hat is not stopping you from making changes.  The media is, and
that's not something Red Hat can control.
Compare this with the TiVO.  TiVO *designs* the thing such that it can
still make changes, but customers can't.
That's the difference.
TiVO is using hardware to "impose further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein", and this violates
section 6 of GPLv2.

It does.  You're making the mistake of thinking that it doens't.  And
even in the legal terms that you claimed to have understood so
thoroughly.
> The rights granted are the rights to "distribute and modify the software". 
More specifically, some of the rights are:
  copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
  you receive it
  modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
  forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
  modifications or work
