Hi Trilok,
The current Trace Clock implementation uses the generic fallback in
include/asm-generic/trace-clock.h as a time source on ARM. It has a 1
jiffy precision and uses a logical clock in the least significant bits,
incremented a each event, to keep track of the event order. Therefore,
you should not rely on timing information more precise than 1 HZ.
However, I wonder if some of the newer ARM boards would happen to have a
cycle counter (timestamp counter), so we could implement a get_cycles()
and trace clock for them ?
