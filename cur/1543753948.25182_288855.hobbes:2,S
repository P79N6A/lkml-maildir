Well, I'm not having much luck.  strace isn't installed on the system
(and is giving errors when trying to compile it).  Also, the ssh session
(and sshd) quits whenever I try running the following growfiles command
manually, so I'm having trouble replicating the kernel panic manually.
# growfiles -W gf14 -b -e 1 -u -i 0 -L 20 -w -l -C 1 -T 10 glseek19 glseek19.2
Anyway, if anyone wants to investigate this further, I can provide
access to the machine (email me).  Otherwise, I'm probably just going to
wait for -rc2 and see if the problem's still there.
Thanks,
Bryce
