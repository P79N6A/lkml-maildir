That's a question for a quiz in introductory course on C:
	what type should x have for !!x to be a valid expression?
	what will be the type of result?
	what are the possible values of the result?
	describe which values of x correspond to each possible value of !!x
You have 10 minutes (and that's a fairly generous, actually).
