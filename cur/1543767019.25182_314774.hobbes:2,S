Ohhh. _NEAT!_ Simple. Me like simple. This will work just perfectly well
with our current approach (well, with some minor adjustments on our side
for the mapping table).
I assume that we're allowed to update the nodeid/sockaddr mapping while
suspended too? ie, if we were to reassign the nodeid to some other
node...?
We can drive this almost directly and completely with a simple plugin.

Okay, understood. So the boundary is within user-space.
