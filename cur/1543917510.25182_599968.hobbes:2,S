 OK, thanks for clarification.  Then both patches already submitted:
patch-netdev-2.6.23-rc6-20070920-sb1250-mac-typedef-9
patch-netdev-2.6.23-rc6-20070920-sb1250-mac-29
apply cleanly to net-2.6.24 one on top of the other in this order.
 I can resubmit them -- where?  netdev?  As I say I am fine with 2.6.25 as 
the target.
