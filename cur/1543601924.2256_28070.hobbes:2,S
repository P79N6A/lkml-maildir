Hey folks,
I have what may be a dumb question, but I can't seem to find a suitable answer.
Let's say you install RedHat out of the box.  When you do that, even if you 
install the kernel source, you don't get a .config file.  Is there some way to 
create a .config file based on the running kernel?
I thought "make oldconfig" would do it, but from what I've read, it doesn't 
sound like that's necessarily true.
Email me privately with your scorn, flames, or even an answer if you have one.
Thanks.
