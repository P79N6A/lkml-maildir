Fine with me. If you remove that line, there are a few others you
should be able to remove as well (declaration of slave_add module
parameter, definition of DEFAULT_OWN, etc.)
Waiting for your updated patch :) Thanks for all the changes you
accepted to make, BTW. I believe the driver is in a better shape now.
