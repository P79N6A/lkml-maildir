So.. if you find long term stability with this.. then maybe it relates
to disconnect but perhaps is just a method of increasing the time
between crashes and the patch is a correct workaround? But why isnt it a
"real" fix if the timer IRQ is not set up correctly without?
I would also like an nvidia or apic opinion on this one.
