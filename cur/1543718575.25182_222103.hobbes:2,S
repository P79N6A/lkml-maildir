I didn't mean that as any sort of insult. I am just tired of the XFree86 
people telling me "implement a generic interface". I write one single 
driver and want the users of this driver to have some sort of comfort. 
Waiting until someone comes up with some generic solution (for a design 
of which I don't have time nor the required knowledge about a zillion 
different systems) I am old and grey.

Well, before I start implementing it (further), I thought it would be 
smart to be able to rely on certain things. As long as I don't even know 
if I get the numbers I don't write code... but frankly, the current 
development sisfb version available on my website has a very few of the 
intended ioctls already implemented.
The interface I intend to use matches the one the X driver has (using 
the Xv extension as an ioctl replacement) and will be documented. Since 
I develope both the SiS kernel framebuffer driver as well as the SiS X 
driver this will reduce duplicate code and ensures good cooperation. 
Furthermore, there could be a common library for both the framebuffer and X.
Hm. Were the matrox folks asked for a "clear interface" in advance when 
they started using the 'n' ioctls? Am I too polite? ;)
sisfb uses a few ioctls already, as an extension to the generic fb 
related ioctls. (Although the version currently in mainline 2.4 is not 
in any way 32/64 bit safe, and neiter is the mainline 2.6 version yet as 
regards the obviously required ioctl32 emulation stuff - investigating 
this at the moment).
