Ok, I definitely agree with the approach (I've not become schizofrenic
yet, but as others can attest, I obviously change my mind occasionally, so 
sometimes I disagree even with my own suggestions ;)
Looks pretty clean as an implementation. The question is whether we should 
aim for 2.6.9 or 2.6.10 - if the first, then I should probably take it 
now, otherwise it should go into -mm first and be merged early after 2.6.9 
has been released, for the first -rc.
I _looks_ pretty safe, and it's hopefully much less likely to have subtle
bugs and races than our old approach had, but I have a hard time judging. 
I assume you ran all your gdb tests on the result? What's your gut feel?
