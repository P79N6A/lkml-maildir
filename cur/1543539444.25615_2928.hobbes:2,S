Hello
Patch vs 2.2.17-pre13 for smbfs
    
http://www.hojdpunkten.ac.se/054/samba/smbfs-2.2.17-pre13.patch.gz
* Tidying some more debug printks (%.*s to get reasonable output &
  __FUNCTION__ to make things fit in one line).
* use linux/ctype.h definition of 'tolower'
* disable smbfs directory cache for all servers to make it see changes
  made on the server (treat NT like 95). (Matt Maynard)
* aDIR flag to allow renaming directories on OS/2 (win95?), fix from
  smbclient. (Matt Maynard)
* fix 2 places where smbfs trust the server data to be correct and reads
  outside the allocated buffer if the server is being "creative" in its
  response (Oops ... quite literally).
Alan, assuming that there will be a 2.2.17-pre14 I'd like to see this
patch included.
In the hope that this message has caught the attention of people willing
to test smbfs patches I'll mention my "features" patch that adds support
for:
  OS/2 lanman2 <something> server
	should work, assuming 2.2.14/15 did.
  nls
	old patch + selectable default codepages in 'make config'
	(need smbmount ioctl hack to enable per-mount setup, I assume most
	 people don't actually need that. Export defaults through /proc
	 and allow changing it through that? maybe).
  recieve timeouts
	avoid processes "hanging" (killable, but not interruptable) on
	mounts from disconnected servers.

This patch goes on top of the other. Testers + feedback wanted.
