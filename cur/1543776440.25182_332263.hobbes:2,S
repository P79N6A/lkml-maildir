Why?
I think it would be more logical to either
  - return -EINVAL if it's not a mountpoint
  - change the type of the mount even if it's not a mountpoint
Is there some reason the user can't do the 'bind dir dir' manually if
needed?

I'm just wondering, why do you need to return 2/3 times per node.  Are
all these traversal points needed by propagation operations?  Why?
Some notes (maybe outside the code) explaining the mechanism of the
propagations would be nice.  Without these it's hard to understand the
design decisions behind such an implementation.

So it just does the propagated 'bind dir dir'?
Why not use the generic propagated bind routine (defined in a later
patch I presume) for this?
