Let me give you and example of the difference between
Linux open source world brain damaged thinking and
what it's like out here in the real world.
Go to a directory with 10k files and type:
rm *
What do you get?
/bin/rm: Argument list too long
If you map a network drive in DOS and type:
del *
It works.
That's the problem with the type of thinking in the
open source world. Why can DOS delete an infinite
number of files and rm can't? Because rm was written
using the "vi" editor and it causes brain damage and
that's why after 20 years rm hasn't caught up with
del.
Before everyone gets pissed off and freaks out why
don't you ponder the question why rm won't delete all
the files in the directory. If you can't grasp that
then you're brain damaged.
Think big people. Say NO to vi!
