It is, but it can be read out either by INT calls at initialization 
time, or by reading out the byte at physical address 0x417:
--------K-M00400017--------------------------
MEM 0040h:0017h - KEYBOARD - STATUS FLAGS 1
Size:   BYTE
SeeAlso: MEM 0040h:0018h,INT 16/AH=02h,MEM 0040h:0096h
Bitfields for keyboard status flags 1:
Bit(s)  Description     (Table M0010)
  7      INSert active
  6      Caps Lock active
  5      Num Lock active
  4      Scroll Lock active
  3      either Alt pressed
  2      either Ctrl pressed
  1      Left Shift pressed
  0      Right Shift pressed
SeeAlso: #M0011,#00587
The same information is available through INT 16h, AH=02h.
