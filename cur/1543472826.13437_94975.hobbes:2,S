Rot.  I've had arguments with RMS about ideology in the past, but more about 
methods than about goals.  The ideology is far from a failure --- and Linux 
itself is proof thereof.  (Which is undoubtedly why RMS wants to make sure 
the world knows it.  Evidently you're one of those who needs the reminder.)
"Rome wasn't built in a day", and the current "order" of the software 
industry can't be ripped apart and reassembled in a different fashion 
overnight.  It takes time and it takes the active cooperation of those 
involved (and this is why Eric Raymond is just as important --- he has the 
ability to make Free Software a goal they can accept, instead of a challenge 
to their very existence.  This is a matter of communication, not of 
differences in goals) if it's to be done relatively painlessly.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
