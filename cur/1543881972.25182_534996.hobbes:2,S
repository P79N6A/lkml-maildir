I'd prefer thaw to be similar to module insert, yes.

I'd actually prefer resume to be similar to module insert, too... Do
you think that resume is _that_ time critical?

[I'd like you to drop me a line saying you understand current design
and that it works -- even if it is very inelegant]
Now, we can separate suspend/freeze and resume/thaw (with some common
helpers). It will speed the code up by avoiding unneccessary
operations. It also needs attetion from driver writers (ouch).
Do we want to do that?
