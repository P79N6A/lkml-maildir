You misunderstand, I think: on *all* archs, smp_processor_id() <
NR_CPUS is an axiom.  Always has been.
The generic solution involved cpu_possible(), but it's too early in
boot for that: attempts to make it a requirement have to change
numerous archs.  Not that I'm against that change...
Of course, an arch can override this default allocator, and may have
more info with which to do optimal allocation.

Because we still need the __alloc_percpu for DECLARE_PER_CPU support
in modules 8(
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
