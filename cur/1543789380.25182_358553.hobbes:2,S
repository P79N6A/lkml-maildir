Sure. You can do it that way too, as I mentioned in the original mail 
about why it was ugly.
But the point is:
 WHY?
Your insistence on CONFIG_SCSI_SATA being a boolean only results in uglier 
configuration, for no gain. And it's not even TRUE. It's only true if you 
consider it to be a "do we support SATA or not" thing. It's not true if 
you consider it "how do we support SATA" thing.
In other words, a tristate makes total sense, if you say that 
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA describes how SATA is supported.

But it's just another sign of you thinking about that config variable the 
wrong way.

No it's not.
CONFIG_NET_BOOL is not a tristate, because it can't be a module. There's 
nothing that forces network drivers to be modules only. Same goes for 
NET_ISA.
In contrast, CONFIG_SCSI=m _does_ force SATA drivers to be module only. 
See? They are not the same at all.

Sure, that makes sense.

No it does not. You continue to ignore the fact that it's not an 
enable/disable thing. It's a "can we enable SATA drivers" vs "can we 
enable SATA drivers as modules" vs "do we do any SATA drivers at all?" 
thing.
A tristate.
Adding the SCSI config is a pure hack because you refuse to see the fact 
that CONFIG_SCSI_SATA _is_ a tristate. Thinking it is a boolean causes you 
to then have to mix in other issues.
