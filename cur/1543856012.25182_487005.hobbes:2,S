  Hi
  Here is the latest rework of the AIO completion signal notification patches.
  This set consists in 5 patches:
	1. rework-compat-sys-io-submit: cleanup the sys_io_submit() compat layer,
	   making it more efficient and laying out the base for the following patches
	2. aio-header-fix-includes: fixes the double inclusion of uio.h in aio.h
	3. export-good_sigevent: move good_sigevent into signal.c and make it
	   non-static
	4. aio-notify-sig: the AIO completion signal notification
	5. listio: adds listio support
  Description are in the individual patches.
  Changes from v3:
	All changes following comments from Zach Brown and Christoph Hellwig
	- added justification for the compat_sys_io_submit() cleanup
	- more cleanups in compat_sys_io_submit() to put it in line with
	  sys_io_submit()
	- Changed "Export good_sigevent()" patch name to "Make good_sigevent()
	  non-static" to better describe what it does. 
 	- Reworked good_sigevent() to make it more readable.
	- Simplified the use of the SIGEV_* constants in signal notification
 	- Take a reference on the target task both for the SIGEV_THREAD_ID and
	  SIGEV_SIGNAL cases.
  Changes from v2:
	- rebased to 2.6.19-rc6-mm2
	- reworked the sys_io_submit() compat layer as suggested by Zach Brown
	- fixed saving of a pointer to a task struct in aio-notify-sig as
	  pointed out by Andrew Morton
  Changes from v1:
	- cleanups suggested by Christoph Hellwig, Badari Pulavarty and Zach Brown
	- added lisio patch
  Thanks for your comments, more welcomed, as usual.
  Thanks,
  Sébastien.
