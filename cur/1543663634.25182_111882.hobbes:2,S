The x86 has that stupid "executablility is tied to a segment" thing, which
means that you cannot make things executable on a page-per-page level.  
It's a mistake, but it's one that _could_ be fixed in the architecture if
it really mattered, the same way the WP bit got fixed in the i486.
I'm definitely not saying that the x86 is perfect. It clearly isn't. But a 
lot of people complain about the wrong things, and a lot of people who 
tried to "fix" things just made them worse by throwing out the good parts 
too.
