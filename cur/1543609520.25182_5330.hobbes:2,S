I gave up Usenet years ago, about when the signal to noise ratio fell
under 0.1% and I got tired of wasting time wading through the flames.
Now, on to your points about coding style. I'll say this once only. I
don't want to waste time with an argument about this.

And one of the very first things that document says that coding style
is very personal and he doesn't want to force his views on others.
So, as a symbolic gesture, I printed out and burned that document.

If and when I step down as maintainer (if I do so, I'll publically
pass the baton to the new maintainer), the new maintainer can indent
to their preference. Until that time, *I'm* the maintainer, and *I*
need to be able to read the code efficiently. It's the part of the
kernel I spend the most time in, after all.
And the coding style used elsewhere in the kernel is revolting to
me. More importantly, it's harder for me to parse than my own style.
I shouldn't have to constantly stumble over an appalling coding style
in my own code!
