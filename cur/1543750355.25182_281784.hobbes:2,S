It looks like the line status monitoring implemented in the driver in
2.6.10 interferes with that in modem_run.  Unless you have a reason to
keep using modem_run, you can let it go and use the line status
monitoring and firmware loading facilities provided by the driver
itself.  Just follow Andrew's advice.
