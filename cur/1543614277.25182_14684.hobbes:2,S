The way LILO does things is perfectly valid.  Not flexible, not dynamic
but valid.

GRUB is a good proof of concept bootloader but I wouldn't call it
a good way to implement things.  As for the Multi Boot Specification
it is hardly a standard, and it got a lot of details wrong.  A big
one is who is supposed to do the BIOS calls.
It should be o.k. for a bootloader to be static, but still useful on multiple
machines for years.  What comes out of GRUB does not encourage a
static bootloader.  But the development of GRUB is slow enough that it
is practically static...

So tell me how you make an MBS compliant alpha kernel again?
