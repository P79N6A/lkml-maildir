Server is the side providing the service - direction of data is
irrelevant. If the service is logging, the side doing the logging is the
server. If the service is console message generation, then the machine
generating the messages is the server.  Client/server architecture
generally implies the possibility of multiple clients per server, and that
seems to make more sense with a 'logging server' than a 'console message
server'.
