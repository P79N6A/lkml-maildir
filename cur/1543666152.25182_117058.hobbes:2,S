I remember, but havn't heard anything for a long time and don't know
the current status.

Look how /sbin/{hotplug|modprobe} is called if needed.

Unlikely.  To ugly to live with (says Linus, and lot of people agree),
and not really needed.  Doing it in userspace also has the advantage
that you can play alot more tricks.  XFree86 for example has a x86
emulator to execute vga bios code on !x86 platforms.  _That_ you
really don't want to do in kernel mode ...
