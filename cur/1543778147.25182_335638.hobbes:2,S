   Probably a very minor point, but shouldn't it be
                        "m" ((tsk)->thread.i387.fxsave))
because that's the largest possible operand that could end up being read?

  Is that function called __save_init_fpu because it saves and then
initializes the fpu?  Unlike fsave, fxsave does not init the fpu after
it saves the state; to make the behavior match it should be "fxsave ; fninit"
