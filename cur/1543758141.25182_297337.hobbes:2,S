Yes, you hit the nail on the head. Well, the other (potentially
more problematic) part of the equation is "3) keep me close to
my parent and siblings, because we'll be likely to share memory
and/or communicate".
However: I'm hoping that on unloaded or lightly loaded NUMA
systems, it is usually the right choice to spread tasks across
nodes. Especially on the newer breed of low remote latency, high
bandwidth systems like Opterons and POWER5s.
When load ramps up a bit and we start saturating CPUs, the amount
of balance-on-forking should slow down, so we start to fulfil
requirement 3 for workloads that perhaps resemble more general
purpose server stuff.
That's the plan anyway. We'll see...
