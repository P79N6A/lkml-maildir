No. They spent some small money on it and wait and see how it works
out. If it doesnt't, well, life goes on.
If IBM, Intel, Compaq, HP, Dell, SGI and other companies would
wholeheartedly drop their Windows support in favour of Linux, that I
would call "a move". If HP would spent only 5% of their driver writing
buget for Windows into Linux driver development, that I would call "a
move". 
Everything else is just "Keeping our options open".
In this market, there are IMHO only two companies that have themselves
openly and clearly committed: SUN and Microsoft.
