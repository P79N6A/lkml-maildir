This sentence above has the tone of you telling others what they
should be working on. I would suggest that adding some words like "but
I hasten to add that I'm not telling people what to write" would have
avoided a negative interpretation.

1) You can't control volunteer work
2) while people are interested in working on something, let them, no
   matter how misguided you think they are. They might come up with
   something really interesting. Their continued efforts are not
   necessarily unwise

Linux may make an evolutionary jump that gives it a tremendous
advantage over (possibly then superion NGOS's), *while remaining
monolithic and POSIX-compliant*. I'm not saying it will do this, but
it *may* happen. Saying that Linux (monolithic and POSIX-compliant) is
doomed to obsolescence is an unprovable statement.

As I showed above, that was the tone of what you said. You didn't say
so explicitely but you implied it.

See above. People are not robots, and they respond to the tone of the
message as well as the explicit content. I'm glad you've made you
position clear in the above sentence. I just think that your original
message could have been less inflammatory.

I'm happy with my message as it stands. But thank you for your
concern. I would ask, however, that you refrain from a condescending
tone.

Let me clarify. By very shortly, I mean in the timescale of a year or
two. That being the same timescale you expect Linux (monolithic and
POSIX-compliant) to become obsolete.

Read further, and will see the connecting sentence.

I think 90% of buggy users switched to cars before my father was
born. So, yes, the analogy applies. Linux has not seen 90% of it's
userbase switch to a NGOS kernel.
Let me be more explicit: *if* 90% switch from Linux, *and if*
developers run out of ideas, then I would consider Linux
obsolete. I'll go futher, if 50% switch to a NGOS kernel and if Linux
kernel developers run out of ideas (to compete with NSOS's), then the
writing will be on the wall.
BUT: while linux Kernel developers keep having new ideas, I don't
expect to see a mass exodus, because it's likely that Linux
(monolithic, POSIX-compliant) will be performance competitive.
And, like I said above, Linux may yet evolve, remaining monolithic and
POSIX-compliant and still compete with NGOS's. I would not be so bold
as to make a prediction either way.

Your thanks are premature. I don't agree.
