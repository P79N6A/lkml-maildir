This can be done today in the bus specific match functions.  And because
of that, I would argue that this belongs in the bus specific code, and
not in the driver core, as it's up to the bus to know what the different
types of "matches" that can happen, and what the priority is.
And yes, I agree that this needs to be done, I've been talking with a
few other people who are interested in it.  I think the lock-rework code
needs to be finished before it can happen properly, so that we can do
the "unbind from one driver and give it to another one" type logic
properly.
