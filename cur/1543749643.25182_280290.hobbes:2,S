The thing is right now we dont try to reclaim from icache/dcache _at all_ 
if enough clean pagecache pages are found and reclaimed.
Its sounds unfair to me.

Why not? If we have a lot of them they will probably be hurting performace, which seems
to be the case now.

Following this logic any workload which generates pagecache and happen to, most times,
have enough pagecache clean to be reclaimed should not reclaim the i/dcache's.
Which is not right.
But yes, feedback based on other workloads is required. I'm hoping people do test 
the next 2.4.29-pre3 and send feedback.
So I'll probably revert the patch if any considerable regression is found.
