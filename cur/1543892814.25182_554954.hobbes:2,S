Subject: [SERIAL] Don't optimise away baud rate changes when BOTHER is used (v2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The uart_set_termios() function will bail out early without bothering to
touch the hardware, if it decides that nothing "relevant" has changed.
Unfortunately, its idea of "relevant" doesn't include c_[io]speed. So if
the baud rate bits are BOTHER and you just change the speed, the change
gets optimised away.
This patch makes it ignore the old Bfoo bits in c_cflag and just check
whether c_ispeed and c_ospeed have changed. Those integers are always
set appropriately for us by set_termios().
This version of the patch lacks the debugging printk which I
accidentally left in the previous one.
