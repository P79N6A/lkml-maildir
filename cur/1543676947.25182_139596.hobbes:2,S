Just out of curiosity, what are "Physical Cluster" and "Logical 
Cluster"?  This terminology doesn't appear in Intel documentation. 
AFAIK, IPIs are currently always sent using logical destination mode, 
and in your patch ioapic entries have logical mode in cluster case. So 
where does physical cluster  come into play?
