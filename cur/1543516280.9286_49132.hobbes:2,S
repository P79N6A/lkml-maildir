(a) I use no new syscalls.  It is backward and forward compatible, and
    more fields could be added if necessary.  (I add them at the end of a
    struct dirent, in an unambiguous and fast way).
(b) getdents64 is the wrong next generation syscall.
    It should be getdirentries{,64} because every app calls Glibc's
    readdir, and that calls getdirentries which currently does redundant
    lseek syscalls.
(c) Is there any point in a 64-bit getdents/getdirentries?
    I see no point in having 64-bit offsets into *directories*, and
    64-bit inodes are unfortunately incompatible with Glibc.
(d) I could always stick bits 63-32 of d_fileno in that struct at the
    end, still with no new syscall...
Summary: no new syscall required even for 64-bit inodes :-)
