 Code in arch/i386/kernel/head.S (look below checkCPUtype) clears
boot_cpu_data.x86_vendor and it does not get reconstructed after secondary
bootstraps.  A common x86_vendor does not make sense anyway, at least in
principle (the whole cpu_data handling needs a rework but I have no time
to continue what I started last year and nobody else seems to work on it
either).  Wouldn't current_cpu_data.x86_vendor suffice?  That will work
for sure.
