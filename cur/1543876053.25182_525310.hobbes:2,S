But this is *not* malloc().  It's mmap().  Are you prepared to guarantee that
there are no applications out there that don't rely on anon mmap() giving
zeroed memory?
The MMU-mode clearing is done for security reasons - there shouldn't be any
leakage between processes, and because the zero page can just be faulted in.
Personally, I'd prefer to maintain compatibility with MMU-mode wherever
possible, but I'm happy with overrides like the MAP_UNINITIALISED flag
suggested.
