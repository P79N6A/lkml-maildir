yeah. I'm totally open to such efforts. I'd also be most happy if this 
was primarily driven via the KAIO effort: i.e. to implement it via 
kernel threads and then to benchmark the hell out of it. I volunteer to 
fix whatever fat kernel thread handling has left.
and if people agree with me that 'native' state-machine driven KAIO is 
where we want to ultimately achieve (it is certainly the best performing 
implementation) then i dont see the point in fibrils as an interim 
mechanism anyway. Lets just hide AIO complexities from userspace via 
kernel threads, and optimize this via two methods: by making kernel 
threads faster, and by simultaneously and gradually converting as much 
KAIO code to a native state machine - which would not need any kind of 
kernel thread help anyway.
(plus as i mentioned previously, co-scheduling kernel threads with 
related user space threads on the same CPU might be something useful too 
- not just for KAIO, and we could add that too.)
also, we context-switch kernel threads in 350 nsecs on current hardware 
and the -rt kernel is certainly happy with that and runs all hardirqs 
and softirqs in separate kernel thread contexts. There's not /that/ much 
fat left to cut off - and if there's something more to optimize there 
then there are a good number of projects interested in that, not just 
the KAIO effort :)
