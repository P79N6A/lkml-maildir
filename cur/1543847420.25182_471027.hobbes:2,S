I think that code does belong there. Yes clocksources and timekeeping
are different. Which is the point of the patch set.
htimers is intrinsically connected to time keeping, but they aren't
housed in the same files. Just because one subsystem uses another
doesn't mean they shouldn't be organized/optimized/maintained on their
own.

Moving the code is a separation issue. I _could_ move it back, but you
haven't convinced me that it wins anything. In fact you've convinced me
that it would be a step back instead of forward.

It's not less maintainable now, or if it is your going to have to be a
lot more specific.
