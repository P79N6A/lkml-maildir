It is.  asm/a.out.h does not exist for MN10300, therefore the export process
breaks unless it is told not to export this header.  The alternative is to
move this line into each arch's individual header Kbuild file.
Whatever, I've moved this to the AOUT suppression patch as that's where it
logically belongs.

Done.  However, I suspect these should be moved into an arch header file
somewhere.

I've ditched the extraneous cleanups.  The jedec file needs a lot of cleanup
work anyway as it's got a lot of lines that begin with a space and a tab, but
that's outside of the scope of these patches.
I've split the addition of the jedec chip type, the fix for the net2280 driver
and the allocation of UART port types into separate patches.  These can go in
advance of the main patch.
I've split the remaining MTD changes into their own patch that goes after the
main patch.

I've moved that into asm-mn10300/kprobes.h.

Upstream and been there for years I believe.
