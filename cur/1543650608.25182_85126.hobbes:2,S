Technically speaking you can achieve ACL like permissions/behavior using
the historical UNIX security model by creating a group EACH time you run
into a unique case permission scenario.
Without ACLs, if Sally, Joe and Bill need rw access to a file/dir, just
create another group with just those three people in.  Over time, of
course, this leads to massive group proliferation.  Without Tim Hockin's
patch, 32 groups is maximum number of groups a user can be a member of.
