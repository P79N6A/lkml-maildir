Mike, are you saying to reverse all of the test6-preN patches
to fs/ext2/inode.c?
I'm having a similar problem, don't know if it's the exact
problem though.
On my system (x86, RH 6.0 + 2.4.0 upgrades),
test6-pre1 and test6-pre2 hang after:
Enabling swap space
INIT: Entering runlevel: 3
Bringing up interface lo
   <HANG HERE>
Is "interface lo" a kernel build option or always present?
If an option, which one?
Now back to booting/using 2.4.0-test5.
