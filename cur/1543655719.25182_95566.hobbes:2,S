The problem is related to this message:
    ACPI-0189: *** Warning: Buffer created with zero length in AML
I have a patch for the oops caused by this, but there may be an additional
underlying problem where the AML is causing a zero length buffer to be
created.

Hmm, when I boot 2.5.51 w/ACPI on it with a battery installed, it panics. 
By booting without and then inserting the battery, I got the attached oops. 
See also the messages in the dmesg output.
