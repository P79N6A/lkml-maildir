Do you mean "struct zone_table" is better as its name?
If so, I'll change it.

Hmmmm.....
Current radix tree code uses slab allocator.
But, zone_table must be initialized before free_all_bootmem()
and kmem_cache_alloc().
So, if I use it for zone_table, I think I have to change radix tree
code to use bootmem or have to write other original code.
I'm not sure it is better way....
Bye.
