....mmmhhh
I have connected a USB-MS-Natural-Keyboard to my machine. With german
keyboard-layout pressing the "numbersign"-key* leads during bootup to a
message "inavalid scancode e0  1e". I had a look at input.h and found
that the "numbersign"-character is not defined there. Up to 2.3.35 the
same key had a scancode of 50.
Okay I mapped the numbersign to another key, but I believe some of you
know a far better solution.
 Nice Day
