I am running 2.6.0-test11 with a duron 1.3ghz with 630mb ram using 
reiserfs and suns 1.4.2_01 jre, with 2.4.xx kernels the java based 
application I run used around 35-50mb memory, with the 2.6.0-test11 it 
goes right to 250mb and rises from there.  When I revert back to 2.4.23 
it is back to 35-50mb memory usage.
