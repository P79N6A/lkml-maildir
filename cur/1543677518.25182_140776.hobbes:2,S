I think i see what you mean.
Still, then what's the explanation for this thing: if i run a non-APIC
kernel, lots of devices are on the same IRQ. Just enable APIC in the
kernel, and change nothing else, and the busy IRQ becomes less busy.
In either case, there are tons of spare IRQs, which just sit there idle,
unused.
If the problem would be entirely in hardware, i would say APIC shouldn't
make a big difference.
Do i miss something?
