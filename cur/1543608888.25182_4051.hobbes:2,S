That can be added. We just have existing interface, and I don't propose to
stick on its actual state as it isn't convenient, but to extend it to cope our
needs.
> Then I need the other /proc/* files as well, not just /proc/sys/*
IMHO whole /proc should be mirrored by sysctl. Then, we can in 2.7 slowly move
those only to /proc/sys. Ideally, only /proc/[pid]/ and /proc/sys/ should be
present in /proc/.

 From the sysctl() manpage:
 size_t *oldlenp;  /* available room for old value,
                      overwritten by actual size of old value */
So, it will happily give you first/last 32 bits (at least something and your
application won't crash UNhappily ;), however it will write to location pointed
by oldlenp that jiffies are 64 bits.

Obviously they shouldn't. Any reason to change them? If you decide it would
be nice to give you also size in something different from blocks, you can just
introduce new ctl with suffix e.g. kb or so.
