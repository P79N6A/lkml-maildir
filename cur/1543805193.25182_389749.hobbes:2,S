Yes, it's a kernel boot option if libata is in the kernel image.
If libata is a loadable module, just use something like
	modprobe libata atapi_enabled=1

Sorry, I mean that I built and booted a kernel with libata/PATA
hard drive (vs. legacy drivers/ide/ PATA support).  I have not
tested ATAPI at all and didn't mean to imply that I had.
I reported on libata.atapi_enabled=1 based on documentation
and other emails that I have read.

HTH.  Please continue to post any questions or problems.
