Last I checked, the Linux kernel build system did compile each .c file
as a separate compilation unit.

Yep.  For example, if it knows the current value of a given such local
variable, and if all code paths that would change some other variable
cannot be reached given that current value of the first variable.
At least given that gcc doesn't know about multiple threads of execution!
