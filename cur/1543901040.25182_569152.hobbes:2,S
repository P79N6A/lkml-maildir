Hi
We have a WIFI driver that only supports a single device at a time. We
want to use 2 devices with the same vendor/device ID, but spawn 2
instances of the same driver. Each instance will handle a single
device.
If we bought the devices from 2 vendors, we'd have 2 DeviceIDs, we can
modify the driver to look at different IDs, which will solve our
problem. But how can we achieve this if we wanted to use the same
device from the same vendor?
Regards
Keith
