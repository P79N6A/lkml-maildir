Well, I am fairly new to Linux. Only since a month or so I am regurlarly 
using Linux and only since 2.6 kernel. I always used preempt and had no 
problems. The only problem I have, is with APIC. 2.6 is very smooth for 
me. I don't know whether it is because of preempt or not. I just was 
curious, why Craig didn't use it and whether the is a connection.
