Hi Chris,
Thank you for your help, indeed this oneliner fixes the corruption. I have
tested with 2.6.12.3 + bio_clone fix and also built an updated RedHat EL4
kernel with the fix included. No corruption anymore.
This fix should be applied to most kernels shipped with the latest Linux
distributions. At least those products called Enterprise something should
hurry in the interest of their customers. Do you think this will happen
anytime soon?
