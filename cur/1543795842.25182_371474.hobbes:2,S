On AMD you only have 4 counters. That's not a lot for some measurements.
The other thing is that PERCTR0 is not like the TSC. It can count cycles
but it does only implement 47bits. At a high clock rate, this can wrap
around fairly rapidly. It all depends on what is the intended usage model.
Suppose you would have a "stable" performance monitoring interface.
One could just use that interface to measure time only when needed.
