NAK.  There's no need to touch i_ino and a lot of reasons for not doing
that.  ->getattr() can fill 64bit field just fine without that and there's
zero need to touch every fs out there *and* add cycles on icache lookups.
WTF for?
Filesystems that want 64bit values in st_ino are welcome to
	* set it in ->getattr() and
	* use iget5()
Less PITA for everyone and less intrusive patch that way.
