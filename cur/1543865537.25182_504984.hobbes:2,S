I'm somewhat stuck. fbmon has the library functions to parse and
optionally fix EDID block, but it lacks the knowledge of the source of
the data; IOW it's not possible to ignore the EDID coming from a certain
head, the flag would be global (which may be less that optimal with
multi-head setups).
So instead of adding an option I'd use the existing broken EDID db,
adding another state (say 'unfixable') which causes the data to be
discarded. Comments?
Giuseppe, can you send me the EDID block of your monitor?
