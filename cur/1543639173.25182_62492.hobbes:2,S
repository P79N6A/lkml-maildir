The specific case of the hack for EZdisk I have no issue with the

Partition handling doesn't show up in any scalability benchmarks. Show
me an IBM 8 way with partition reading showing up in lockmeter

So fix the heuristics to the official algorithm. Thats a good thing to
do and test in a development kernel tree.
And btw lots of people still use < 512Mb and < 4G disks. No doubt you'd
prefer your kernel only ran on a pentiumII or higher
