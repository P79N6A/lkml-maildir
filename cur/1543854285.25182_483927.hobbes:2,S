Yeah, Al Viro noticed that about reiserfs earlier this month. The
problem is that there's really no good fix for it. I was under the
impression that csum_partial would be arch-independent and was in asm/
for performance reasons. The comment in asm-x86_64 indicates that's not
the case, but the comment in asm-i386 still doesn't. I developed the
code on i386. Moving forward we can define an arch-independent hash
function for that and accept the old arch-dependent checksums, but
there's still the issue of old kernels not understanding it on any arch.
Kind of a nice shot to the foot considering the work I put into making
reiserfs endian safe in the 2.4 days.
I'm hoping there's a better solution to be found than creating a
checksum verifier that checks all known versions. :(
