Same cam be applied to shm ? Thus kernel Documentation/Changes should be
changed:
System V shared memory is now implemented via a virtual filesystem.
You do not have to mount it to use it. SYSV shared memory limits are
set via /proc/sys/kernel/shm{max,all,mni}.  You should mount the
filesystem under /dev/shm to be able to use POSIX shared
memory. Adding the following line to /etc/fstab should take care of
things:
none        /dev/shm    shm     defaults    0 0
to
shm        /dev/shm    shm     defaults    0 0
