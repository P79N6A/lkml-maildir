Building on top of the memory cgroup makes sense given that it has a
lot more knowledge of the actual state in different contexts compared to
something like security_vm_enough_memory()/__vm_enough_memory().
Despite that, a notification layer on top of cgroups in general might be
worth thinking about, particularly since each controller may want to use
notifications for different things. It is conceivable that people will
also want different types of notifications from the memory controller
beyond a simple lowmem notifier.
The LSM lowmem module itself used multiple notification levels to tune
application behaviour for instance, though obviously this is something
that is highly workload dependent.
