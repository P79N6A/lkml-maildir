That isn't what the Configure.help entry claims to do though.  Let me
illustrate:
On the server we have two filesystems, / and /usr.  On the / filesystem,
we have a /usr directory which has a file `foo' in it.  But the /usr
filesystem is mounted on top of the directory which contains foo, so on
the server one sees the contents of the /usr filesystem, which does not
include the file `foo'.  The question is, when one exports /, does one
get to see /usr/foo or not?  And that is what CONFIG_NFSD_SUN decides.
The only place this is mentioned is in fs/nfsd/vfs.c:
#ifndef CONFIG_NFSD_SUN
        if (dentry->d_mounts != dentry) {
                return nfserr_perm;
        }
#endif
That is, the behavior with CONFIG_NFSD_SUN set to No is to check
if this is a mountpoint and if it is, return a permission error.
If CONFIG_NFSD_SUN is turned on, one can see `under' a mount point on
the server.
Would someone care to knock up a better description for this config
option and submit it as a patch to Linus?  The current text is evidently
confusing.
