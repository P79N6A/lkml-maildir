I thought about extending the current Oops report:
* include the complete stack dump, including current
	(i.e. 8 kB on i386, 16 kB otherwise)
---> ability to reconstruct all local variables, in
	the complete call chain.
ability to find buffer overruns on stack etc.
* test all registers if they point to valid memory,
	and dump a few hundert bytes if the memory
	is valid.
--> ability to analyze the structure where the bad
	pointer came from.
The overall dump would be 10-40 kB binary data.
I know that this would be overkill for most oops'es,
but disk space is cheap, and ksymoops could throw
away most data unless e.g '--realy-verbose' is set.
Note: I usually use a kernel debugger for finding
bugs during development. If I analyze an oops than
the oops is from a linux end user - the fewer times
I must ask for more details the better.
