I agree with Guennadi's concern about removing clients' notification
of new devices available in the system.
I understand that this design is based on polling instead,
however polling is always less efficient approach.
Do you think that restoring notifications in this redesigned dmaengine
would be more painful than limiting clients to polling solution?
