    I'd be interested in knowing how a tmpfs that's gone far into swap
performs compared to a more normal on-disk fs.  I don't know if anyone
has ever looked into it.  Is it comparable, or is tmpfs's ability to
swap more a last-resort escape hatch?
    This is the part where I would add something valuable to this
conversation, if I were going to do that. (But no.)
