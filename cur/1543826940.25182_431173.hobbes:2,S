Enumeration is a separate issue.  You wouldn't argue that every potential
PCI or USB device must get registered, right?  Only the ones that are
actually _present_ get registered.
But here you argue that platform bus should not work that same way ... it
should register devices that can't be present.  If nothing else, that's
an inconsistent aproach.
Plus, consider the common situation that a given pin could potentially
be used with several different devices.  On a given board, only one of
those devices will be wired up.  It's counterproductive to register any
of the others ... error prone, waste-of-kernel-address-space, etc.

Whether the device is there or not is a hardware issue.  Board schematics
will show which devices are relevant ... registering any others is just
wastage.  "Clean" is somewhat in the eye of the beholder; in mine, wasting
system resources is not clean.
