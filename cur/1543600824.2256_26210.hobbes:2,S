latency isn't critical, infact the point of rcu is not to care about the
performance of the writer, so it wouldn't be a showstopper if it takes
more time, but still this doesn't change that with RT threads the writer
will be faster.

They almost only costs memory. I also don't like unnecessary kernel
threads but I can see usefulness for this one, OTOH as you said the
latency of the wait_for_rcu isn't very critical but usually I prefer to
save cycles with memory where I can and where it's even cleaner to do so.
