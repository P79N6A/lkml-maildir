I dunno about Adrian, but I'd rest easier either way
if we knew which optimization in -Os causes the problem,
and whether this is a compiler bug.
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.3.1/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize
%20Options
has a nice list of the optimizations performed by -O2, but
the list for -Os is a bit fuzzy, darn it.

p.s. For the curious, the url of that patch seems to be
