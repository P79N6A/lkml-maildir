NFS is a bit tricky. Reiser used to be broken on it, and at least from large
XFS NFS Servers I know that they tend to be unstable, still.
For the Database Servers, I am not sure how well they operate with
journaling filesystems. I think Linux Journal had an article on performance
on that.
Reiser might be your bet, depending on the usage pattern of the filename
space, with Ext3 catching up. Personally I love the XFS features for
resizing in connection with LVMs, but i guess you can have that with Ext3
and Reiser, too.
