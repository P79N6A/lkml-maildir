Good catch on this fix, but really he's hitting the
BUG_ON() in fib_sync_down()  (I hate i386 backtraces,
it's an art to decode them properly)
So if you rmmod() a device before any routes are ever
created in ipv4, this triggers.  I didn't think this
was possible, but it is.
The fix is simple enough.
