I've freshly installed last kernel on RedHat 5.1 distribution and compiled
it.
After booting new kernel it crashed after TCP-kernel-message. Screen is
disturbed (flickering pixels) and further processing is stopped.
Kernel 2.0.36-3 from RedHat is normally booting.
Following hardware content is provided by NEC:
CPU:		Pentium II 300MHz
RAM:		64 MByte
Corelogic:	IntelBX
Video:		ATI Mach64 Rage LT Pro rev 220, Aperture @0xfd000000,
Registers @ 0xfebff000, Block I/O @ 0xec00;  4 MByte RAM (most possible
cause)
Cardbus: 	RICOH RL5C478 (i82xxx - Driver)
Sound:		ESS Maestro -2E (ES1978) PCI
FastIR:		NatSemi NSC 338
Software:	gcc-2.7.2.3-11
		binutils-2.9.1.0.4-2
		glibc-2.0.7-13
Because of nonworking XFree-Server (also Mach64-3.3.3.1) under 2.0.36 I
stepped down from disabling fb-drivers via exclusion of mtrr-option  to
Pentium-Processor instead PPro. The (optical) patterns have changed, but the
location of the break seams to be the same.
I haven't actually tried the X-demo from XINSIDE under 2.0.36, but they have
published the 2nd patch related to this graphics device from ATI. This may
be a hint to some more sophistcated problems with this chips.
	- Points a not working VGA16-driver in basic 640x480 resolution to a
not correct detection in OS?
	- What PCI-information is used from an eventually broken BIOS?
Some hints of bios related video problems are shown in
"
http://ftp.pbnec.nl/support/itemnr/NECBIOS00221000.html".
 But the link
won't work. I've noticed the hotline of NEC Germany.
May be somebody can fix some parts. Beside I'm not an artist in kernel
configuration (can only compile it), I'd assist with best effort.
