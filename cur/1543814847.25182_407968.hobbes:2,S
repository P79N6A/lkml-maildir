It's not clear what you mean by this.   What does "silently caught" mean?
I _think_ you mean "a negative tv_sec gets treated in a random fashion, but
with my preceding patch it will incorrectly get -EINVAL, so fix things to
accept this large tv_sec".  Or something else.
Please clarify.
What happens if change sys_setitimer() to normalise the incoming timeval as
I suggested?  I guess that doesn't affect this..
