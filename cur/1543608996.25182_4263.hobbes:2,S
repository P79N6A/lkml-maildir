It's dumb that an unrecognised option be a fatal error.  Same
problem with modules, actually.  If you add a new module option
to modules.conf and then go back to an older kernel your module
won't load (here's where kaos pokes me with the rtfm stick).
You can create a second entry in lilo.conf which refers to the same
kernel image, but which doesn't have the rootflags option.
