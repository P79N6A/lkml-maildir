It is unfair for you to separate 1. and 2. They should work
together. Remember, you said "return error from close is
useful BECAUSE my smart application may deal with it."
If fsync works, the argument does not hold water at all.
Your smart application can do fsync just as easily.
If it does, it does not need the return code from close.

I know about the improvements. They are applicable to NFS too.
What I am trying to tell you is that there was NO reason to break
close in particular. Even on ancient AIXes without fsync they
could have used an ioctl.
