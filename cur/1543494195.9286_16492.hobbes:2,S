Yes.  So on a perfect real-time operating system this would be
entirely sufficient for monochrome operation.

   Or memory map the frame grabber and write to the file - thats how the
   existing video4linux rtjpeg tools work
Well, if the frame grabber driver does not mind mapping 20GB in one
piece...  I have to test both and see what I will do.

Well, if it does not, it is 2.2.x news.  On our stock RedHat 5.2
Alpha, a write via dd if=/dev/zero is aborted after 2GB, with an
appropriate error message.  Of course I will be glad to hear of any
change made.  I would guess that >2GB files on the Alpha are possible
on NFS and some foreign file systems.

   Right now you can set it up so that you DMA from the capture card to
   the memory and then write it ought through the buffer cache. Stephen
   Tweedie has O_DIRECT patches for Linux (I dont know how tested they are
   on Alpha but they survive Oracle on x86 so ..) that willl mean you are
   doing DMA direct back out from the same memory
Sounds good.
Thank you,
