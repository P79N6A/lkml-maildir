Hi, I'd like to fix a minor nit I've had with linux for a while, however I
need a bit more information, and would like to know if a patch would be
accepted.  After running make menuconfig (and it's friends) you get told
to type "make bzImage" which is only right for i386, and IMHO should be
changed to be arch dependant.  Has anyone done this, does anyone have a
recommendation as to how, or failing both those two, can I get a complete
list of the correct "make blah" lines for each arch?
	Thanks
		Nick
