Well, I didn't mention that I first sent this to him more than two
months ago.  He hasn't had time to reply about it so it may be that
he's not actively maintaining the serial driver.  Queried a couple

BTW, in the original thread, David M. seemed to indicate that
Russell was in support of this FWIW.
