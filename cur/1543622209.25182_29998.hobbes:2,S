Aha, here is my output on 2 x 1 GHz:
<4>Using local APIC timer interrupts.
<4>calibrating APIC timer ...
<4>..... CPU clock speed is 1004.5421 MHz.
<4>..... host bus clock speed is 133.9388 MHz.
<4>cpu: 0, clocks: 1339388, slice: 446462
<4>CPU0<T0:1339376,T1:892912,D:2,S:446462,C:1339388>
<4>cpu: 1, clocks: 1339388, slice: 446462
<4>CPU1<T0:1339376,T1:446448,D:4,S:446462,C:1339388>
<4>checking TSC synchronization across CPUs: passed.
<4>Waiting on wait_init_idle (map = 0x2)
<4>All processors have done init_idle
And the same part for 2 x 933 MHz:
<4>Using local APIC timer interrupts.
<4>calibrating APIC timer ...
<4>..... CPU clock speed is 937.5672 MHz.
<4>..... host bus clock speed is 133.9380 MHz.

I would say this means the TSC skew fix is broken and shooting down your box. What do you think, Alan?
