Possibly a known kernel problem, you may have read past the end of data 
into the pad sectors of the DVD and gotten garbage at the end of the ISO 
image. Use isoinfo to determine the correct size of the ISO filesystem, 
and compare. You can try setting readahead on the DVD reader to zero 
with blockdev.
If the file is smaller, other bug, if readahead hit EOF it returns no 
data instead of a short read, the blockdev fix should handle that as 
well. This was supposed to be fixed in recent kernels, that may be true.
I suggest the cdwrite@other.debian.org mailing list is a better forum 
for CD/DVD/BR problems, good technical people, unfortunately with 
personal agendas in some cases.

That's odd, I would expect the data on the disk to just be the wrong 
size, and get a CRC on that. You might also use readcd to pull the data, 
that almost always does what it should.

Could be anything, in no order dirty lens, bad drive, bad DVD, firmware 
error, cable, power supply, acpi confused... could even be a poorly 
handled end of data on the DVD. Not enough info for me to tell, for 
sure. Trying readcd is cheap, turning off readahead on the DVD drive is 
easy, if the problem persists you probably want to take it to the 
mailing list.

I'm not sure I helped, but you now have more and better things about 
which to be confused.  ;-)
