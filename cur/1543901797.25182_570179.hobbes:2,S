The exploiting application would have to run in the role of the
userspace cache manager. In other words, you need to,
  - open /dev/cfs0
  - mount the Coda filesystem and pass the file handle of the opened
    cfs0 device as one of the mount options
Both of these actions already require root, and if you can get this far
without root priviledges it would be considerably easier to just hand a
setuid root shell through the mounted Coda file system.
So I didn't consider this a critical root hole.

Well, in that case someone forgot to update the MAINTAINERS file.
