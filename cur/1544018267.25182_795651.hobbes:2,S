Okay, thank you for explanation :)
I think it's better to explain "why this is much easier to use rather
than oom_adj and what is the benefit to users." in your patch description
and to improve your documentation.
+But it is very difficult to suggest an order among tasks to be killed during
+Out Of Memory situation. The OOM Killer controller aids in doing that.
As.
 Difference from oom_adj:
 This allows users to specify "strict order" of oom-kill's select-bad-process
 operation. While oom_adj just works as a hint for the kernel, OOM Killer
 Controller gives users full control.
 In general, it's very hard to specify oom-kill order of several applications
 only by oom_adj because it's just affects "badness" calculation.
