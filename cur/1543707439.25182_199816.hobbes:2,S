Ok,
now that Intel has finally come clean about their x86-64 implementation
(see
http://www.intel.com/technology/64bitextensions/index.htm?iid=techtrends
+spotlight_64bit
for full details), can somebody write up a list of differences? I know
there are people who have had access to the Intel docs for a while now,
and obviously Intel is too frigging proud to list the differences
explicitly.
>From what I can tell from a quick look, it looks like it is basically just
the 3DNow vs SSE3 thing, but I assume there are other details too. Can
people who have been involved with this make a quick list for the rest of
us who only got to see the final details today?
(And I assume there's somebody with a few patches pending..)
Thanks,
Linus
