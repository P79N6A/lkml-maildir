What does this prove. PA-RISC has this problem in reverse for I/O cycle access
to PCI slots on hppa1.1 at least. Cookies work _fine_
And by the time you are taking a spinlock who cares about the add, you can do
that while the bus transactions for the atomic op are completing
On the other hand each call, each push of resource * pointers costs real clocks
on x86
