I think we're still digesting it.  I need to sync up with Michal and the 
Xilinx people.  The libc and kernel API changes have to happen in 
tandem, otherwise Michal can't properly test the kernel he's pushing.
I am the defacto MicroBlaze uClibc and toolchain "builder" but somewhat 
reluctantly - am trying to convince Xilnx to hand that over to someone 
who is expert at it.
Michal, John L, any thoughts?
