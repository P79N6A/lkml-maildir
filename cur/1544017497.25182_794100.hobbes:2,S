Applied to tip/x86/urgent, thanks Mike! Note: for such changes we want a 
more comprehensive changelog that explains the motivation - i wrote one 
up, see the commit below.

Subject: [PATCH] x86: put trigger in to detect mismatched apic versions
Impact: add debug warning
Fire off one message if two apic's discovered with different
apic versions. (this code is only called during CPU init)
The goal of this is to pave the way of the removal of the apic_version[]
array. We dont expect any apic version incompatibilities in the x86
landscape of systems [if so we dont handle them very well and probably
never will handle deep apic version assymetries well], but it's prudent
to have a debug check for one kernel cycle nevertheless.
