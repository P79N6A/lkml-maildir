This patch wouldn't compile with CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y (I'm using
2.6.0-test4-mm5).  Simple fix below.  With this patch my machine is worse
off than without it.  In either case the machine hangs during boot (not
in the same place, of course).  And booting with pci=noapci works w/out
the patch, but leaves the machine nearly disfunctional w/ the patch.
Any particular information helpful?
thanks,
