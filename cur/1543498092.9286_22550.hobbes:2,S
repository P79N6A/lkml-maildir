That's one way to get around it, but it is the wrong fix: you should
not rely on order of execution of the init scripts, because a PCMCIA
network card doesn't even need to be present when these scripts are
executed.  The real problem is that RedHat customized the PCMCIA
network configuration script /etc/pcmcia/network, rather than putting
their changes in /etc/pcmcia/network.opts file where they belong.  The
PCMCIA-HOWTO shows how to set up network.opts properly on Red Hat, if
you install PCMCIA from scratch.  If Red Hat just updated their PCMCIA
tweaks, this would never be an issue.  And I reported this to them
YEARS ago.
