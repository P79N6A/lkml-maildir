Absolutely. I would want to see some real benchmarks before we do this.  
Not just some microbenchmark of "how many page faults can we take without
_using_ the page at all".
I agree 100% with you that we shouldn't shift the costs around. Having a
hice hot-spot that we know about is a good thing, and it means that
performance profiles show what the time is really spent on. Often getting
rid of the hotspot just smears out the work over a wider area, making
other optimizations (like trying to make the memory footprint _smaller_
and removing the work entirely that way) totally impossible because now
the performance profile just has a constant background noise and you can't 
tell what the real problem is.
