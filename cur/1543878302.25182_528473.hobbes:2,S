Nice.  But on what workloads? 
Anyways it looks promising. I hope we can just
replace old style sparsemem support with this for x86-64.

Sorry that triggered my usual RDTSC rant...
Not on NetBurst (hundred of cycles) And on the others (C2,K8) it is a bit dangerous 
to measure short code blocks because RDTSC is not guaranteed ordered with the surrounding 
instructions.
