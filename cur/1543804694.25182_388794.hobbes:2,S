      That seems to have been an observation of the current patchset.

You don't need a same container check.  If something is in another container
it becomes invisible to you.

I concur.  Except I think the initial impact could still be large.
It may be worth breaking all users of pids just so we audit them.
But that will certainly result in no long term cost, or runtime overhead.

Similar. But I was actually talking about just adding another flag to
sys_clone the syscall underlying fork().  Basically it is just another
resource not share or not-share.
