Hi Marcelo,
I just realized that the ChangeLogs from 2.2.23 to 2.4.24-pre-3 are 
apparently missing on kernel.org.
They do not appear in /pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/ChangeLog-2.4.24, which 
is right, AFAIK.
However, they didn't made it to
/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/testing/patch-2.4.25.log ;-(
Of course, google groups has a copy of the ChangeLogs ;-)

PS: Thanks for maintaining the 2.4-kernel.
