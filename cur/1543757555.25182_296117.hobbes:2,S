Subject: Getting the page size of currently running kernel

Is there any way to get a running kernel to tell you the size of its pages?
Why: I'm writing a quick Perl hack to monitor the memory usage of the TCP 
stack over time.  Easy enough: /proc/net/sockstat gives the current value of 
tcp_memory_allocated.  But how do I convert this into bytes?  I don't want to 
hard code PAGE_SIZE into my Perl script, complete with a lookup table for 4K 
vs. 8K architectures!  Am I missing something obvious here?
Thanks,
