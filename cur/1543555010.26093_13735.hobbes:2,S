Agreed. Posting to linux-kernel (as opposed to only the maintainer and/or
Linus) serves the following purposes:
 - For patches introducing new features or changing existing ones,
   this exposes them to public review. (Every once in a while, even
   seemingly trivial and harmless patches are found to be wrong.)
 - For patches fixing problems, this confirms the existence of the
   problem to people who are dimly aware of it, it provides a possible
   solution to those looking for one, and it tells those who are trying
   to fix it that somebody else is already working on it.
Concerning Cc to Linus, well, I'd be surprised if he's dying to get
more mail of the "FYI" type ;-)
- Werner
