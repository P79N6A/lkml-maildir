Since "noexec" was already rendered useless - yes.
Before, people could use it and hope the binaries
won't get executed (and if it was possible to execute
them by invoking ld.so directly, then ld.so could have
been fixed). Now the only possibility is to not use the
"noexec" at all.
So does that add to security or substract?..
