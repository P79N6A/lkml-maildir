Hello.
I noticed something similar discussed before but I found no answer..
I downloaded a 700M ISO to a file server and then, as usually, tried
to md5sum it. When I md5summed it where I downloaded it, it was OK.
However, when I did md5sum over NFS, I got _different answers every
time I tried_. Also, I recieved much of these errors on the client
machine during the md5summing period:
"NFS: server cheating in read reply: count 8192 > recvd 1000"
(Server side did not give any errors.)
I have seen this error for many times before but I didn't count it
as anything serious. But when md5sum fails like that, then it means
NFS actually screws the data aswell, right?
The server is 2.4.20
CONFIG_NFS_FS=m
CONFIG_NFS_V3=y
# CONFIG_ROOT_NFS is not set
CONFIG_NFSD=m
CONFIG_NFSD_V3=y
# CONFIG_NFSD_TCP is not set
# CONFIG_NCPFS_NFS_NS is not set
And client is 2.5.66-bk10
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
CONFIG_NFS_V3=y
# CONFIG_NFS_V4 is not set
CONFIG_NFSD=m
CONFIG_NFSD_V3=y
# CONFIG_NFSD_V4 is not set
# CONFIG_NFSD_TCP is not set
I think that these errors started to come along after I went over to 2.5.
