Code reformatting, unless 100% automatic with a 100% proven and C99
aware formatting tool, also introduces instability.

So did many when reiser 3 was fresh, it was much raved about its speed,
stability, its alleged recoverability and recovery speed, and then
people started sending full filesystem dumps on tape and other media to
Namesys...
It's impossible to fully test nontrivial code, every option, every
possible state exponentiates the number of possibilities you have to
test to claim 100% coverage.
