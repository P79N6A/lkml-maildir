Subject: latest list of unused Kconfig variables

  now that 2.6.25-rc1 is out, i can start updating the output from my
scanning scripts.  the first updated output is the list of currently
unused Kconfig variables -- variables that are defined in some Kconfig
file somewhere but appear to be entirely unused throughout the source
tree.
  latest output here, sorted by architecture:
http://www.crashcourse.ca/wiki/index.php/Unused_CONFIG_variables
as always, there will probably be some false positives for one reason
or another.
  output from the other scanning scripts will be up in short order.
