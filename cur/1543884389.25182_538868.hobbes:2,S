You are being very mysterious.  Please describe this bug (privately
if you think it's exploitable), and let's work on the patch to fix it,
rather than this "debug" patch.

Your addition of page_add_new_anon_rmap clarified the situation too.

The patch which changed do_swap_page?
commit c475a8ab625d567eacf5e30ec35d6d8704558062

[PATCH] can_share_swap_page: use page_mapcount
Or my intended PG_swapcache to PAGE_MAPPING_SWAP patch,
which does assume PageLocked in page_add_anon_rmap?
Yes, I can send you its current unsplit state if you like
(but have higher priorities before splitting and commenting
it for posting).
