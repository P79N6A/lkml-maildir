Have you tried your code by writing the data with-out performing any
operation on data (like xor) ? This will tell you whether your
__block_write_full_page is working fine or not because you will get
exactly the same data as of the original file !
And are you also taking care of write operation other than
address_space_operations->writepages ? Because there is also
file_operations->write which ext3 is assgining do_sync_write
(
http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/fs/ext3/file.c#L111
), so are you
handling this too ?
