  find . -name Kconfig\* | xargs grep select | grep CRYPTO
It seems, you have one or more of the following options enabled:
BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP
DM_CRYPT
INET6_AH
INET6_ESP
INET6_IPCOMP
INET_AH
INET_ESP
INET_IPCOMP
IPV6_PRIVACY
IP_SCTP
NFS_V4
RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5
Disabling all of them should enable you to disable CRYPTO.
