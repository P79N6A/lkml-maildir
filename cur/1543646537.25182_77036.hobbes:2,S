Hello,
I'm trying 2.5.40 and frequently my keyboard and mouse are "freezing",
usually accompanying a change in the console (exiting xfree86 or
switching virtual consoles).  Otherwise everything is fine, I can telnet
in and reboot.
This is the message that I found in the logs:
kernel: uhci-hcd.c: ef80: host controller process error. something bad
happened
kernel: uhci-hcd.c: ef80: host controller halted. very bad
If I can provide more information, please email me directly as I'm not on 
the list.
-Michael
