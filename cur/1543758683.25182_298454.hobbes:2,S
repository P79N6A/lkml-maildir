How about changing this to:
          - "Geode/MediaGX" for the AMD (formerly National) Geode family
and the Cyrix MediaGX.
And similarly for the MGEODE option and help text?  Since the AMD Geode
family is current and the MediaGX is old.  And perhaps expand the help
text to list the various SoCs since it's not immediately obvious from
their names that they have a Geode core?
