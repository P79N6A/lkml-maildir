If I haven't misunderstood completely, you can use the package at
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net
 to read LDM information on spanned
disks under w2k/XP. What is not clear [to me anyways] is;
a) Is it possible to mount and read/extract the data on a 5-disk w2k
Dynamic Disks? In case, what commands do I use [commands, options, etc]?
b) Is there any difference between NTFS 3.0 and NTFS 3.1 in regards to
handling the file systems and/or commands?
Thanks,
