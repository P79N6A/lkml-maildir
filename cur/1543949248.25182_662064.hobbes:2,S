I was able to reproduce the system exception on resume with a 3rd-gen 
Titanium PowerBook G4 667, and this patch does let the system resume 
successfully now.
Not quite clear if there was possibly an updated version coming using 
pci_enable_device() instead of the pair of pmac_call_feature() calls, 
but either way, this is a definite must-have, at least for older ppc 
macs -- my Aluminum PowerBook G4/1.67 suspends and resumes without this 
patch just fine.
