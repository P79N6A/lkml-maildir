There are at least 3 arches already using this scheme there is no 
speculation here. The slab use in i386 is for exactly the same purpose. 
There is nothing new here. It consolidates code and fixes the page struct 
use conflict between slab and arch code. The conflict is the main reason 
why I want this. That way I will not have the special casing in SLUB and 
we can make SLAB support debugging for all slab caches.

Lots of arch code depends on page table pages being in a known state for 
reuse this is nothing new.

If you decide to optimise the full-mm teardown then you will have to 
rework more than half of the arch handling of page table pages since they 
all rely on pages being zero on return.

Yes it is if its a funky idea without code or any data to support a major 
change in the way we handle page table pages. And this falls into that 
category.
