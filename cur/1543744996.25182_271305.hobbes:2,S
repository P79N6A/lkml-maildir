Adam,
I agree with your point that every device in the system should have a
driver attached. And i8042 does have one bound to it. It is i8042 platform
driver that does power management and ensures proper integration into driver
model.
There is no need to keep secondary "drivers" around, their sole purpose is
to provide information about avalilable resources. It would be ok if the
code was shared among several devices on a bus but for most (all?) legacy
devices it has to be programmed explicitely and will not be reused.
Also i8042 should not rely on either ACPI or PNP simply because the driver/
chip works on boxes other than x86/ia64 so we can't make ACPI or PNP drivers
"main" ones. 
As far as binding/rebinding goes I guess sysdevs and platform devices will
just disable this functionality.
