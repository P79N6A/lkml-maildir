The 2.6 kernel needs new tools to load the kernel modules, because they have a 
different format (not just a different extension with .ko).  
module-init-tools provides those necessary upgrades, and also aids in 
creating /etc/modprobe.conf, which is used instead of /etc/modules.conf under 
the 2.6 kernels for loading modules on startup.  If you don't have 
module-init-tools, then I'm not surprised you are having problems.  You 
probably need an updated mkinitrd as well if you are using an initrd on 
system startup.
They should be at 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/
You probably want to read a document that summarized the changes that happened 
in 2.6, which is where the link above was located.  It is 
http://www.linux.org.uk/~davej/docs/post-halloween-2.6.txt
Not knowing much about Slackware, I couldn't give you much help about where 
the best place to get your tools from might be, except for the source above.

/var/log/XFree86.0.log would be the place.  I don't think there will be 
anything interesting there until you get your module-init-tools installed.
I hope this has helped.
