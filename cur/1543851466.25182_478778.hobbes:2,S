	To be clear that's a limitation of configfs as an interface. In the
Resource Groups code, for example, there is no hard limitation on length
of the underlying list. This is why we're talking about a filesystem
interface and not necessarily a configfs interface.

	That depends on how you do it. For instance, if you don't have an
explicit list of tasks in the group (rough cost: 1 list head per task)
then yes, it could be difficult.
