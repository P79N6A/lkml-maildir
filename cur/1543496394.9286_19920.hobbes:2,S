 Hi,
 Some files in the kernel source tree are not world readable by default.
(i.e. with permission set by tar xzf linux-2.2.9.tar.gz from the
kernel.org mirror on metalab.)  It has been this way for a while, not just
in 2.2.9.  Don't know when it started though.  It has alway been the two
files
Documentation/kernel-docs.txt
Documentation/proc.txt
 demonstration:
tar tvzf linux-2.2.9.tar.gz | grep -e ---
or (on this machine)
cd /usr/src/linux
find -not -perm -044 | xargs ls -ld
-rw-------   1 root     root        15872 May 17 14:54 ./Documentation/kernel-docs.txt
-rw-------   1 root     root        53064 Feb  6 16:46 ./Documentation/proc.txt
( That find command will find any file or directory which is 
(not group readable) || (not world readable)
, assuming I got it right.  (I did check it with chmod, though, so it
should be finding any problems.)
 This is not exactly an urgent problem, but it is really easy to fix.
Paste this into your shell:
chmod 644 Documentation/{kernel-docs.txt,proc.txt}
should do it.
Thanks for writing my favorite OS, keep up the good work :)
