Its small, its relatively sanely structured and its not that bad
stylewise. Nothing a few seds, an indent and a polish wouldn't cure. As
to the ioctls - its a specialised driver for specialised purposes so the
ioctls are not IMHO an issue beyond worrying about compat_ and if you
want compat_ interfaces for them or not.

Public domain is GPL compatible.

Some of that comes about because a lot of them are out of tree
maintaining non-free stuff, shipping binary products - often entirely
binary without a Linux or GPL label - until the man in black catches them
and sues them in Germany.

Quite honestly your stuff is *less* obscure than some of the hardware we
have in-tree drivers for, and rather cleaner.

The problem is that its very impractical. If I change a kernel API I fix
up the in tree users and test those I can, that's "accepted practice" -
you make mess doing a job you clean it up. I can't do that for out of
tree code because its out of tree.
