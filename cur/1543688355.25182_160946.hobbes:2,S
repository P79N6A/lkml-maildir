Hi.
Has there been any changes recently? I search with google for that patch 
but could'nt find anything, maybe I missed something?
And how about 2.6 kernel + 1210sa + sata seagate 120G?

   I've tried this card with all of the hdparm options that I could
think of. I got no success either. However, Andre Hedrick claims[1] to
have got the SiI3112 and 3114 working in his tree (a couple of weeks
ago). He's testing it[2] before release.

[2] I believe that one of the tests is whether he's got paid for the
work by the people who contracted him to do it, which is where I
suspect the real delay is.
