I suppose that means I need to update the ppc64 iommu code to actually
honor the DMA mask when allocating ;) That will be easy for "dumb"
iommu's like the G5 but might be a bit more tricky with pSeries.
Anton, Paul, we have no control on the DMA ranges allocated to each phb
in the system, do we know if they go beyond 32 bits ? (And if yes,
beyond 40 bits)
Ben.
