Isn't there a conflict here between standard kernel code and ALSA?
Documentation/sound has examples for char-major-14 pointing to various
modules, including sb, opl3, mad16 etc.  ALSA uses soundcore for
char-major-14.  Which one is correct?  Until ALSA is in the kernel I
prefer to follow the kernel documentation.
The kernel has no examples for sound-service or sound-slot.  ALSA maps
sound-service-0-0 (two numbers, not one) to snd-mixer-oss, not sound
and maps sound-slot-0 (one number, not two) to snd-card-0, not sound.
What are the correct values for these entries?
