Without the patch any of the 10 of 11 fields can go negative after enough
activity, not just rd_ios
With or without these patches, when there is activity on a partition
ios_in_flight[1] looks sane for the individual partition statistics since
ios_in_flight doesn't go negative, but the same activity causes
ios_in_flight on the drive (hda instead of hda1 for example) to be
consistantly negative (usually -2 or -3 in my case) with brief periods of
being positive.  This causes use and aveq (hd->io_ticks and hd->aveq in the
kernel) to have bogus numbers.
I'm hoping that there is a nice patch that has been waiting around
somewhere, and that it's trivial enough for 2.4.24 inclusion.
Here's[2] an example from my test box.  There is activity on md0 which
consists of hd[aei]3 and almost no activity on the other partitions.  Look at
use and aveq on hdi.  There is no correlation to use and aveq on hdi3 since
it has overflowed so many more times than hdi3.
ricklind@us.ibm.com seems to be involved in the 2.6 diskstats code, is he
also involved in the 2.4 code?  Unfortunately he seems to be on vacation at
the moment.  There is no maintainer mentioned in the 2.4 MAINTAINERS file...
