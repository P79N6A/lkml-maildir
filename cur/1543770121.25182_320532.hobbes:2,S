Greetings Everyone.
I've written, with significant help from MosChip which provided me with
some extra data, the driver for MCS7780. The official documentation
for the chip is available at:
http://moschip.com/data/products/MCS7780/All_7780.zip
The driver is in a *very* early alpha stage but works a little bit.
It can:
* Setup hardware.
* Talk at 9600 bps.
* Receive packets and pass them to irda stack
* Send packets from the stack to the outside world.
It can't:
* Change the speed althoug hardware supports up to 4Mbps FIR mode.
* Handle most of possible errors.
* Make a cup of tea ;-)
* A lot more
The lists are quite equal at length ;) I would like to ask you kindly to
look at my code and maybe, if you have an MCS7780 IR dongle, try it. I
will appreciate any comments, patches and flames.
You can download it from either:
http://www.ee.pw.edu.pl/~stelmacl/mcs7780-0.1alpha.1.tar.bz2
or
http://stlman.fm.interia.pl/mcs7780-0.1alpha.1.tar.bz2
For the record the code is quite havely based on stir4200 driver since
both chips has simmilar principles of operation. They both need a
software do the framing for them. I also borrowed ;) the makfile from
the Broadcom Gigabit Ethernet driver sources.
I am not subscribed to LKML, please CC any answers.
Thank you in advance
Best regards.
