Well, it's one of the primary arguments for the expensive infrastructure
behind the per-mount r/o patches, as checkin the counter here means
we can now do exact tracking of the writable status of the superblock
and thus avoid the remount r/o races.
But there's another argument for it which is unrelated to the per-mount
r/o patches.  fs_may_remount_ro is the last non-trivial user of
sb->s_files and the file_list_lock.  Peter Zijlstra identified the
latter as scalabilty problem, and I'd really prefer to get rid of the
list and the lock instead of hacking around these issues.  Removing
sb->s_files will also allow removing a list_head from struct file
with some additional hackery to the tty core which should be a nice
memory safer on big systems.

Well, the first revisions of the patches added a list of vfsmounts
to the superblock, and I wasn't quite happy with that because I though
we could get around that easily.  Given that we can't get around it
easily I'd be happy to take my comments back.
