Then we have a problem... Either we chose to keep 2 different interfaces
for MMIO and "PIO" with the "s" versions on PIO and not on MMIO, the
raw versions on MMIO but not PIO, etc...
Or we decide to unify this properly.
In all cases, the current abstraction doesn't allow to re-implement
{in,out}s{b,w,l}. This is already a problem as if a driver need to
pump a fifo with some udelay's (like doing a _p version of one of
the above), it can't or has to do some arch specific crap to deal
with byteswap, barriers, etc...
