Do you have one of those systems to hand? My betting is on that when you 
enable APIC/IOAPIC you will see crashes very frequently. This isn't enabled in 
the default kernel config..
PS, Ross: Again, great work, thanks. I am running the patches you posted in 
the thread starter (without the previous ones) on 2.6.3-rc2-mm1 without problem.
