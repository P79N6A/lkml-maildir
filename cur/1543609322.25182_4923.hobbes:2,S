I know that much. I was just curious whether there was any particular
reason why it was that way.
Somebody suggested that it was because of "scheduling hooplas" causing a
serious loss of performance if modules were moved to ring 1. I've no
idea whether such is the case

They've been getting problems from me - I just checked, and the main
suggestion appears to be to replace /dev/rtc with a sysctl call. I can't
see the point in that myself, and /dev/rtc makes far more sense to me.
I will add that I personally see no problem with the kernel reading RTC
on boot to set the syste clock, although some of the correspondents
appear to have problems with that idea as well.
Best wishes from Riley.
