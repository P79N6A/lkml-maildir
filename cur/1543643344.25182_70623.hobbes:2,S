What I don't like about that is, module_exit doesn't know the exact state
module_cleanup was in when it encountered the error.  Look at how error
cleanup is done normally: a bunch of gotos that jump into a sequence that
releases resources in reverse order to the way they were allocated, so
that each initialization state has a corresponding error cleanup state.
How are you going to recover that level of precision if the error
cleanup is in a separate function?

Yep, another point nailed down.  I'm keeping a list ;-)

Ah, this relys on synchronize_kernel only being called when necessary.
In general, that can only be known by the module itself.  This is one
more point we agree on, and which differs from Rusty's proposal.

User space complexity is an issue too, if there is an approach that
avoids complexity in both the kernel and user space.

Humble apologies.  I will rewrite it now that I've had some practice
at explaining the points.  The second try should be much more concise
and backed with more actual code.  Some of which I will shamelessly
lift from you and Rusty ;-)
