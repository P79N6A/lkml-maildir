The problem that you can have with multiple threads calling epoll_wait() 
on an SMP system, is that if you sweep 100 events in one thread, and this 
thread goes alone in processing those, you may have other CPUs idle while 
the other thread is handling those. Either you call epoll_wait() from 
multiple thread by keeping the event buffer passed to epoll_wait() farily 
limited, on you use a single epoll_wait() fetcher with a queue(s) from 
which worker threads pull from.
Davi's patch will be re-factored against 22-rc1 and submitted in any case 
though.
