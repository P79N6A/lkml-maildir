Huh? That means (the admittedly rather useless, but still common)
setgid directories without group write are inacessible. They get
created that way in a setgid directory if you umask group execute.
FWIW, Solaris lets you access "mandantory locked" directories, but
not files.

Right. And if you don't allow access to mandantory locked files, there
is no problem here.

It is, and statd.
