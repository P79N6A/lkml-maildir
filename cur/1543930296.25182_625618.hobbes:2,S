As it turns out, preallocation is not a such a good solution I
think because in the general case the system may need many
allocations to support the added memory, so it would be difficult
to know how much pre-allocated memory is needed.  I think a
preferable solution is to use memory from the newly added
region.
I don't plan to work on a pre-allocation method.  I think I can
free up sufficient memory in other ways.
