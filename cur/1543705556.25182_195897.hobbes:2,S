it does already zero the meta-data. I was simply asking if you think the 
whole "erase" operation should be under the control of chattr 's', or 
just a subset (i.e. only data overwriting is optional). Its clear now 
that you want the whole thing to be controled by chattr 's'. I'll knock 
that up then, and re-submit.
peace,
