i strongly disagree. It's a nightmare to have three variants of the same
code at once. (mdtools, raidtools and raidtools2.) This mess has been
cleaned up in 2.4, and we shouldnt touch 2.2's RAID code beyond bugfixes.
This is not support for 'old hardware', it's support for the very same
thing.
moving the RAID files into a separate directory is a natural cleanup in
the context of 2.4, but it's just causing confusion in 2.2.
