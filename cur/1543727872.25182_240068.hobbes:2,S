Discussions are based on exchanging arguments.......
It seems that Linus is just trying to prove that he still has no arguments.
Wouln't it be wise for him to stay quiet instead of wasting other people's time?
He should takle an advise, spend 5 minutes on something useful and fix the show

/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h
