"cleaner" = much harder to upgrade to new upstream LZO versions -> bad
"perhaps faster" = different from the well-known original code and
                   might again contain new bugs -> bad
"perhaps faster" = if we fork LZO and actually get it faster, all the 
                   other LZO users will not benefit -> bad
zlib and LZO are special because they are maintained userspace code 
imported into the kernel.
