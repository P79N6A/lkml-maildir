You totally ignored all the evidence to the contrary, and have made use of 
clever, circular logic. He needed access to the code to make a modification 
he'd made for other printers. But that doesn't change the facts. Its about 
source code access. It has *NEVER* been about being able to run program X on 
platform Y. It has been about the ability to change Program X to do task Y. 
If the distinction between "run" and "modify to perform a task" isn't clear 
to you, then I have no hope of you ever understanding my statement or the 
truth of it.
