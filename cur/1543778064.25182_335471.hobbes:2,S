It's a very - very - very old and bad logic (at least nowdays) from the
stone age to free up memory. Memory is for using ... If you have memory why
don't you want to use? For an actively used system, memory should be used as
much as possible to maximize the performance. The only problem when kernel
does not want to "give back" used memory for eg caching for an application
though but it's another problem ...
Anyway, want to have 'free memory' is a thing like having dozens of cars
in your garage which don't want to be used ...
