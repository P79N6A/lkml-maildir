I've got no plans to care about 2.2 and gcc 3.0. Trying to deal with all
the fun things gcc 3.0 does (quite legally too the ones I looked at) is
hard. The amount of work required to fix it is large and given 2.2 is
there for maximum stability also pointless, since its an untrusted compile
combination.
