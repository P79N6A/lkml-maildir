Gene,
The Received: header data are telling something else.
You read them from bottom-most up -- new one is always inserted on top of
the existing headers.

It does look like you have a forwarding setting at gmail to your
verizononline.net service.  If you had chosen to pull email out of
gmail, then perhaps you would not have had any verizon problems.
While conspiracy mongering has its fun, I do think that you are in fact
causing this all to yourself by trying to push the message flood to
Verizon..  For what it matters - LKML has 3 subscribers on  @verizon.net
addresses.
I do run my own mail-server, and my Linux mailboxes are at present over
1 GB/y.  Gmail mailbox would be a bit larger - underlying database
granularity is around 128 or 256 kB, as I recall having read about
google technology.

Yes, I would fetch directly from gmail, if I were you...
