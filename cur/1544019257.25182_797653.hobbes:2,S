NACK. Epoll allocates globally about 100 to 160 bytes (32/64 bit) for each 
file added to the interface:
	for i 1..1024
		for j 1..1024
			if i!=j
				add j -> i
That's (N^2 * {100, 160}) = 100MB to 160MB of pinned kernel memory, 
explotable by simple users with untouched NFILES.
This is the reason such limit was introduced in the first place. Again, 
for the 10th time, if you have a loaded server with multiple processes 
using epoll:
$ echo NN > /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_instances
Note that NN does not consume any resource "per se", so if you feel 
threatened by such limit, you can go wild with it.
