Well here is the comments in mm/vmscan.c
        /*
         * Hey, if somebody wants to kill us, be our guest.
         * Don't come running to mama if things don't work.
         */
        siginitsetinv(&current->blocked, sigmask(SIGKILL));
So basically a word of advice...if you don't want it dead
don't be killing it...I guess there could be reasons as
to why you'd want to kill kswapd.  I can't think of any
though.  I guess if you want to defeat this "feature"
Just #if 0 out the siginitsetinv line in mm/vmscan.c
