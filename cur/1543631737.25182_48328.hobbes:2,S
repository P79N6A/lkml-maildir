Yeah. I am having a hell of a time with HP keyboards, and
I would like very much if you can help.
With 7.3 we roll a pretty stock 2.4.19-pre (called 2.4.18-4.x),
so there is practically no difference in this area. You may
be better off looking at stock kernels because the problem
is not Red Hat specific.

Yep. "rmmod hid && insmod hid" fixes it, and this is what
makes it hard to debug. However, your hint about the disconnect
is very important.

This is also needed for Linux: LILO or GRUB won't work unless
this is enabled. Kernel does not care, naturally...

It is linked from this bug:

Please make sure that Vojtech is in the loop. I do not really
follow the input and HID code (after months of trying :).
