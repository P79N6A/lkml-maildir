Ehh, it's getting pretty clear that you are looking at
2.6.16-rc5-git<latest> and I'm using -mm here, since that code is not
present in mm/slab.c in 2.6.16-rc5-mm2 in anything near that form.
And since 2.6.16-rc5-git8 is not experiencing problems I'd suggest you
perhaps instead take a look at what's in -mm... That's where we need
to work (it seems) to find the bug...
