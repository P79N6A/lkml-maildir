This seems to be turning into a rehash of the argument over paging versus
overlaying.  Paging does an okay job of keeping code around when it is
probably going to be useful soon, and doesn't require much thought to use.
Overlaying can do a superb job of keeping just the code you're going to
need real soon, but using it takes lots of thought and measurement by
people who know how to think about it.  Likewise, those 200 small files
may have been selected and packed into that tarball because the designer
*knows* that they are related and that many subsets will be wanted all
together, and that they are not usefully related to any other files he's
aware of.  The question is, then, how hard is it going to be to do good
selections?  Is it worth the bother, or should we just let a
general-purpose filesystem continue to do an okay job?
