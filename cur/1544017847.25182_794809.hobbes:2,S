Ext[234] is sophisticated to have on-disk uuid record. Most file systems in the patches (except jfs
and reiser3) do not have a persistent uuid, a reasonable/feasible solution without media format
modification is fsid in boot/mount life cycle. That's why huge_encode_dev(sb->s_bdev->bd_dev) is
used here.
For jfs and reiserfs3, is there any use case for persistent fsid cross boots ?
Thanks for your reviews.
