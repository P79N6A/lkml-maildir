No you're not missing anything. This problem causes many machines to 
break horribly when MMCONFIG is enabled. There's a patch in -mm to fix 
this. (It special-cases the case of host bridges and doesn't disable the 
  decode bits for those, since some are known to do crazy things if you 
do that.)

Good to know. There was some speculation that it did not.
