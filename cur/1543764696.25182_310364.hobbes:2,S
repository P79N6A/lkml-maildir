Subject: [PATCH linux-misc-2.6] scsi: remove volatile from scsi data structures
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/10/1

 Hello, James.
 Hello, Christoph.
 This patch removes volatile qualifier from scsi_device->device_busy,
Scsi_Host->host_busy and ->host_failed as the volatile qualifiers
don't serve any purpose now.  While at it, convert those fields from
unsigned short to unsigned int as suggested by Christoph.
