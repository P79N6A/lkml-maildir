I got the same impression too, but I do think this statistic is 
important if someone wants to know which program suffers most when 
(heavy) swapping happens. Some programs like "top" would also get 
benefit since  its "swapped" accounting is just based on virtual-rss, 
which is wrong (just showing parts that haven't been brought to RAM)

Let's see if I can adapt this idea. Actually, in the first place, I was 
thinking this way but sometimes it is easier to get pointer to 
vm_area_struct rather than to mm_struct. I'll take a deeper look...
Avoiding atomic operation is also my another primary target....

Yes, I use anon_rss a the "guidance" on where I probably put the 
swapped_out accounting and decide whether it  actually has anything to 
do with swapping or not. Hmmmm, looks like I still miss a lot...

:( OK, re-checking...

Perfect closing, i forgot to clean that printk(). Thanks for reminding 
me...
Refined patch will follow ASAP..
