There's a file system protocol used by many digital still cameras,
which isn't actually camera-specific.  Not MSFT-specific either.
Originally called "Picture Transfer Protocol" (PTP) it's actually
more of a remote hierarchical filesystem protocol ... with an event
channel (handy for "new picture" or "inserted new flash memory")
and some built-in search capabilities ("what JPGs do you have").
The strangest capability was a file type tag, which isn't actually
that bizarre.
As with RNDIS, and USB Mass Storage, I understand that support for
PTP is part of MS-Windows since about Win2K.  So a PTP gadget
driver would probably be a useful contribution to Linux.
