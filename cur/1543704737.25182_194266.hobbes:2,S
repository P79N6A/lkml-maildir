Hello MLs,
today I switched from no-raid to linux kernel software raid 1 on a jfs
and a ext3 partition. Both are working fine, but jfs_fsck reports an
error on the jfs md device (md2 <-- hda3+hdc3):
Superblock is corrupt and cannot be repaired 
since both primary and secondary copies are corrupt. 
Did I miss something? jfs_fsck runs without any error on hda3 and hdc3,
but fails on md2.
I'm using the 2.6.2-rc2 kernel with raid autodetection.
TIA
	Florian
