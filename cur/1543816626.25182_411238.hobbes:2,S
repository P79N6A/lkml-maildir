AFAICR, the problem with gcc3 and unit-at-a-time was stack usage with 
local variables on automatically inlined functions.
For instance, if function A called B and after B returned called C, both 
local variables of B and C would be given a reserved space on the stack 
during the execution of A if both functions were automatically inlined. 
So the space needed now was A+B+C whereas before was Max(A+B, A+C).
