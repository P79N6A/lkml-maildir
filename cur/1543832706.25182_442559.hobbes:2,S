Updated version available.
* Link resume handling in the previous version was broken causing libata 
to ignore hotplug event after a link has been hot-unplugged.  Fixed.
* A few other hotplug related problems are fixed.
I expect this version to have well-behaving PMP and hotplug support. If 
anything seems weird, please report.
