If I would be acquiring the big kernel lock in inode.c you would now
complain me that I am not allowing SMP threaded fs to scale (and I would
agree with you and that's why I didn't do that in first place).

locked != dirty. If you want to make progress with slow bdflush syncs
you'd better try to free inodes once they are not dirty.
