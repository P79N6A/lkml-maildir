Yes, but I meant a program which reads a single binary value and outputs it
as ascii, as a generic layer between the binary /proc and the ascii world
of shell scripts.
I don't like a binary /proc.

I've been around for six years (that is, six years on Linux, not quite as
long on lkml), which isn't quite long enough, I think.
But I agree: /proc is populated with files that don't really belong there.
Maybe everything should be moved to /kernel? (except for the process info,
offcourse).

It will be very, very hard for distributors to create a distribution which
runs one the native 2.6 /proc interface as soon as 2.6 comes out. I think
we must assume rewriting things like procps, init scripts, etc. will only
start as soon as 2.6 comes out. We should provide some transitional period
for userspace to adapt, but make clear to everybody that compatibility
isn't going to last forever.
