linux-2.4.3-cryptoapi-hvr4/drivers/block/loop.c lines 270...279 after your
kernel patch:
static int lo_read_actor(read_descriptor_t * desc, struct page *page, unsigned long offset, unsigned long size)
{
	char *kaddr;
	unsigned long count = desc->count;
	struct lo_read_data *p = (struct lo_read_data*)desc->buf;
	struct loop_device *lo = p->lo;
	unsigned long IV = loop_get_iv(lo, (page->index * PAGE_CACHE_SIZE + offset - lo->lo_offset) >> LO_IV_SECTOR_BITS);
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	if (size > count)
		size = count;
Have you tested that code with partitions or files that are larger than
4 gigs? On systems where int is 32 bits, that computation overflows.
If you want 512 byte based IV computation without modifying your kernel at
all, you can use the loop.o module from my loop-AES package. I haven't tried
using your modules based cryptoapi and my loop-AES drivers together, but I
don't see any obvious reason why they couldn't be used simultaneously.
My loop-AES package is here:
