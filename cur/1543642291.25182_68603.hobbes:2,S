Won't happen:
					O_DIRECT write starts
					+ takes XFS iolock exclusive
					- invalidates pagecache
					+ downgrades iolock to shared
					- perform write
	xfs_setattr for truncate called
	+ takes XFS iolock shared
	  -> blocks
					- write i_size to something
					+ releases iolock
	  -> gets woken
