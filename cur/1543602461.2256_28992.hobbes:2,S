Last time I looked, those patches made the already ugly vm locking 
even worse.  I'd rather try to use some of the rcu techniques for 
page cache lookup, and per-page locking for page cache removal 
which will lead to *cleaner* code as well as a much more scalable 
kernel.
Keep in mind that just because a lock is on someone's hitlist doesn't 
mean that it is for the right reasons.  Look at the io_request_lock 
that is held around the bounce buffer copies in the scsi midlayer.  
*shudder*
