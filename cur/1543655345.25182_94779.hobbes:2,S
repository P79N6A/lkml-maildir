    I've tried too with a home-made boot loader which works in LBA
mode (I use it in my system and works OK) using a no-emulation boot
CD, but then the kernel is not even loaded :(
    Thanks for the explanation :)) Why this did work on older kernels
but not on 2.4.x :????
    Anyway, I think I will use a patched version of Isolinux. Less
complications and more power than a raw disk image :(
