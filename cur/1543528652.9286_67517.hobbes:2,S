	I don't know when si_band field is ported in 2.3 but I'm using
2.3.47+ where SI_SIGIO is already not generated. Now POLL_xxx events are
generated instead. There is no problem with si_code < 0 in 2.3.
	I consider rt mechanism in 2.2.x (x<15) as unusable because:
- we don't receive the event type/mask
- sometimes SI_SIGIO can't pass the permission checks (EPERM), this is a
2.2 bug, as you found it.
	I backported si_code/si_band patch from 2.3 in 2.2.15 and now I'm 
happy. Now si_code contains POLL_xxx and there is no problem with the
unexpected SIGIOs.

	You can check all problems You found in 2.3 too. For 2.2 may be
nobody wants to modify this behavior - the "applications" could be broken.
In 2.3 you have to check si_code for POLL_xxx instead for SI_SIGIO.
si_band is useless as the events are not merged and the info in si_code
is enough.
	May be it is time the problems, if any, to be fixed in 2.3.
May be sys_rt_sigqueueinfo really need to be fixed, current->uid/pid can
be used to replace the user provided si_uid/pid.
	I don't see SI_MESGQ, SI_TIMER and already SI_SIGIO to be
generated from the kernel (2.3.49). But SI_ASYNCIO is generated which is a
bug if SI_ASYNCIO < 0 and if it is generated not from user space. Any
SI_xxx < 0 generated from the kernel must be corrected. But may be these
codes are still not used.
	So, the only correction which is needed for now is in
sys_rt_sigqueueinfo. Are the other codes generated not from user space?
Or they are still not implemented.
