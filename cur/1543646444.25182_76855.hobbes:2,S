Hi Alan, thks for replying.
So, this basically means 2.4.20 final will contain all improvements on
the -ac branch plus the critical backports from 2.5.x? Will this be the
cure to all my probls? ;)
Seriously speaking: do you have confirmartion that the IDE updates on
the -ac branch fix the cd audio ripping timeouts? Do you want me to try
it out? <newbie>If so, can I simply apply the 2.4.20-pre8-ac3 on top of
my vanilla 2.4.19 source code or is any other patch required?</newbie>
Again, thks for looking into this.
Best,
Andre
