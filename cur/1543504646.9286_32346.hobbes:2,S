ok, i may have missed something, but i'm not talking about unmapping.  
all i want to do is "unreference" these pages -- simply clear the
reference bit.  if there is no memory pressure, nothing else will happen.

a max-rss is already maintained (via get/setrlimit).  are you thinking of
some other value that could be computed by the VM system?
