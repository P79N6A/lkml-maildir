You could do that from userspace probably, by doing some math 
on all processes statistics versus global stats, but does not 
seem very practical.

That would be "nr_mapped".

Hum, the core pagecache code does not deal with such details, 
so adding (and maintaining) accounting there does not seem very 
practical either.
You could walk /proc/<pid>/{maps,smaps} and account for different
types of pages.
$ cat /proc/self/smaps
bf8df000-bf8f4000 rw-p bf8df000 00:00 0          [stack]

Shared_Dirty:         4 kB
Private_Clean:        0 kB
Private_Dirty:        0 kB 
But doing it from userspace does not guarantee much precision
since the state can change while walking the proc stats.

Problem is that any kind of information maybe be valuable,
depending on what you're trying to do.
For example, one might want to break statistics in /proc/vmstat
and /proc/meminfo on a per-zone basis (for instance there is no 
per-zone "locked" accounting at the moment), per-uid basis,
per-process basis, or whatever.
Other than the pagecache stats you mention, there is a 
general lack of numbers in the MM code.
I think that SystemTap suits the requirement for creation
of detailed MM statistics, allowing creation of hooks outside the 
kernel in an easy manner. Hooks can be inserted on demand.
I just started playing with SystemTap yesterday. First
thing I want to record is "what is the latency of 
direct reclaim".
