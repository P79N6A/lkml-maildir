I just tried installing 2.5.7.
After patching the sys_nfsservctl problem, I got everything installed, started to boot it, and it Oopsed ('attempted to kill init!', whee!).
So I went looking for ksymoops, and, lo and behold, it's not with the kernel anymore.
So I downloaded it, tried to compile, and got a bunch of 'undefined reference's from merge.o in libbfd.a.
I googled every possible combination of this, but couldn't find a solution.
How do I get this oops decoded?
