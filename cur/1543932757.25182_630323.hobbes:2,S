Subject: [PATCH 0/4] add task handling notifier

With more and more sub-systems/sub-components leaving their footprint
in task handling functions, it seems reasonable to add notifiers that
these components can use instead of having them all patch themselves
directly into core files.
Patch 1 introduces the base definitions and hooks for task creation
and deletion.
Patch 2 switches delayacct to make use of the notifier.
Patch 3 makes the procevents/connector use the infrastructure and adds
additional notifiers needed there.
Patch 4 makes the security keys handling use this, too.
