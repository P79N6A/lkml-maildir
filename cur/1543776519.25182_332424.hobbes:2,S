No Flame from me.  One thing to remember is that Hans and friends _have_ supported
R3 for years.  This is an undisputed fact.  Second third parties have be able to add much
function (like journaling) to R3 so the code must be sort of readable...  With R4 they have
created a new FS that is _fast_ and _can_ do things no other FS can - I also expect they have
written cleaner code...  Why are we fighting about adding this sort of function to the kernel?  
Yes it may not be the absolute best way to do things.  How many times has tcpip be rewritten 
for linux?  The answer is more than once.  Lets put R4 in, see how it works, generalize the ideas 
and if we have to rewrite and rethink part of it lets do so.  
Please do add R4 to the kernel!
Thanks,
Ed Tomlinson
