Subject: [PATCH 000 of 4] md: assorted md patched - please read carefully.

Following are 4 patches for md.
The first two replace
   md-allow-devices-to-be-shared-between-md-arrays.patch
which was recently remove.  They should go at the same place in the
series, between
    md-allow-a-maximum-extent-to-be-set-for-resyncing.patch
and
    md-lock-address-when-changing-attributes-of-component-devices.patch
The third is a replacement for
    md-change-iterate_rdev_generic-to-rdev_for_each_list-and-remove-iterate_rdev_pending.patch
which conflicts with the above change.
The last is a fix for
    md-fix-an-occasional-deadlock-in-raid5.patch
which makes me a lot happier about this patch.  It introduced a
performance regression and I now understand why.  I'm now happy for
that patch with this fix to go into 2.6.24 if that is convenient (If
not, 2.6.24.1 will do).
Thanks,
NeilBrown
