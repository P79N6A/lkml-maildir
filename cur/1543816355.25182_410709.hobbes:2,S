__wait_queue.private already holds a
pointer to the task structure of the waiting process
I might be able to implement what I need in a way
that more closely resembles how wait_on_bit extends
the standard wait queue. But the result is the same:
a new wrapper (new structure containing wait_queue_t
and access/init functions) built on top of the
existing wait queue.
I'll revisit this tomorrow to make sure I'm
thinking about this correctly.
