Install the package "kernel-source" from zq (source) series.
The patch in the archives you have to look for is named ...boot-splash...
The important files in the patched kernel tree are:
linux/drivers/video/fbcon-splash.[ch]
There are some more changes in the whole fbcon* files (for alpha blending
etc.).
