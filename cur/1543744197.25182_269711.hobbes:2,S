Christian, I don't know if this patch explicitly fixes your problem, but
it fixes problems other people have been having with the driver core
lately.  I'd appreciate it if you could test it out and let me know if
it solves your problem, with CONFIG_EDD enabled, or if it doesn't help
at all.
thanks,
