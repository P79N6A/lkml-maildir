Subject: 2.2.1-ac5, poll returns EINVAL

I have been testing the many file descriptor stuff, and things generally
look quite good.
There is one puzzling problem though.
Calling poll with an array of 48 entries (all the same fd and mask)
returns an error with errno = EINVAL.  This isn't a documented error for
poll.  Reducing the poll array to 24 entries does work.
I don't see this under vanilla 2.2.1.
This happens on UP and SMP.  The systems are plain RedHat 5.2 except for
the kernel.
I have run over 20,000 fds through poll in other programs.  The count
shouldn't be a problem.  Having the same fd everywhere (and event mask)
is odd, but never explicitly discouraged.
Is this a kernel bug or are we abusing the usage too badly?
