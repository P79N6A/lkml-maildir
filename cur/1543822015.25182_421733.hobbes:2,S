I must say I always hated them because adding code to the context
switch for such an obscure POSIX bu^w"feature" is just a bad idea.
Maybe it would be best to remove it again instead of adding the 
scaling needed to make it actually work
(since we got along with such a broken implementation for so long I 
would guess that nobody uses these timers anyways)
