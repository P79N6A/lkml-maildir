That would be fine, it's what I suggested in an earlier email. In the
future Jamie's suggestion is probably the one that makes the most sense
- just keep a per-driver limit setting which informs the block layer of
max sectors the hardware truly can do, and try and time request
execution if you care about latencies.
But lets not forget the original question, which is when and if 32MB
request make sense at all. Right now they probably don't.
