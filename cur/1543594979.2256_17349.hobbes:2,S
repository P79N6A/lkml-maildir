1- This symbol is mine;
2- It is part of 2.4.6-pre5 only as a dependency argument, with no
   point where a value is actually assigned to it;
3- It is likely to be different when the actual question for which the
   user need an help text is merged into the mainline kernel.
So you can safely ignore it for now.
Maybe it could be a good thing for your tool to ignore missing help text for
symbols that don't get enabled interactively by the user?
