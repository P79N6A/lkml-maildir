I have tested the 2.6.10-rc* kernels too. Here is the full list:
2.6.8      : ntpd working : low drift
2.6.9      : ntpd working : low drift
2.6.10-rc1 : ntpd working : low drift
2.6.10-rc2 : ntpd working : low drift
2.6.10-rc3 : ntpd failed  : high drift
2.6.10     : ntpd failed  : high drift
2.6.12     : ntpd failed  : high drift
2.6.14     : ntpd failed  : high drift
The picture is very clear: the problem start from the 2.6.10-rc3 kernel. 
All the kernel that make ntpd failed can be fixed by the "noapic" option 
to make ntpd working.
Log of kernels 2.6.8 to 2.6.10-rc2 say this:
kernel: ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
kernel: ..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=2 pin2=-1
kernel: ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
kernel: ...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...  failed.
kernel: ...trying to set up timer as Virtual Wire IRQ... failed.
kernel: ...trying to set up timer as ExtINT IRQ... works.
Log of kernel 2.6.10-rc3 to 2.6.14 say this:
kernel: ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
kernel: ..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=0 pin2=-1
I don't understand if the problem is the pin1 that change from 2 to 0 or 
if this is because the code to solve the "MP-BIOS bug" is not executed 
(maybe because it is not in the kernel anymore, I have not verified).

After trying several time, I am unable to upgrade the BIOS of this 
machine. The flash utility hang all the system at the very beginning of 
the real access to programm the flash! This is maybe because I use a 
freedos image over pxelinux. I will try with a floppy and a MSDOS if I 
found such olds stuffs somehere.
Thanks a lot for the support,
