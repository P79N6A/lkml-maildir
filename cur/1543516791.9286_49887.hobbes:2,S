I'm afraid that's all there is.  The system hung hard after that and
was unable to write anything else to the log.
We can see something in general, anyway ...
Nov 20 06:25:39 bgpc kernel: VM: Removing swap cache page with wrong inode hash on page c2105000
Nov 20 06:25:39 bgpc kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
Nov 20 06:25:39 bgpc kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 00b61000, %cr3 = 00b61000
Nov 20 06:25:39 bgpc kernel: *pde = 00000000
Nov 20 06:25:39 bgpc kernel: Oops: 0002
Seems to be a VM problem, doesn't it?  And if so, are there VM
problems in 2.2.13 that could cause such an Oops and are there patches
I should try?
