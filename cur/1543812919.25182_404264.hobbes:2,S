I've double checked that our current DMA code always stays below 32
bits. I was more wondering about some not-yet there stuff but it looks
like we are safe on that side too.
One thing i've been looking into doing with the iommu code is to make it
capable of respecting the DMA mask precisely (by constraining the
allocator to any arbitrary mask, not just 32 vs. 64 bits) to make it
more useful for bcm44xx and 43xx... but that's a different story.
Ben.
