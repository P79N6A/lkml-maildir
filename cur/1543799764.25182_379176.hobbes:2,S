Hi,
Thomas, Ingo, I would really appreciate if you didn't pick up on some small 
detail in my mail and draw final conclusions from it for the whole 
discussion, before you even have seen the final result. I really thought I 
made it clear, that this patch is more a proof-of-concept patch, which make 
your comments rather pointless, especially since you leave the central parts 
of the mail uncommented, you didn't even have a single question about it. 
This either tells me you understood what I wrote, but it's beneath you to 
comment on it or you didn't understand it and you just want me to shut up. 
Either way I have a hard time not to take it personal.

Fine with and that's exactly what the rest of the mail was about.

ktime_t doesn't magically solve all problems, it just hides them better.
The main point of my mail is to provide a theoretical base of a good 
gettimeofday implementation, which would allow a generic _and_ fast 
implementation. Why do you insist on 64bit, if I can actually prove it's only 
a waste of time?
bye, Roman
