	I have also used solderable BNC plugs, Tech America has them.  Donno if
you know about Tech America, they are ok, but what is good is that you
can get catalog from any Radio Shack.  If they don't have one they can
get it easy.  They also have ones that do not require crimping tool, they
are called "clamp on" and I used these in the Service.  They work the
best, because you clamb the braiding (an shielding) into the plug itself.
	All in all I would use store bought until you NEED to make one because
molded plugs handle stress where the coax goes into the plug better than
cables where you add your own BNC.  Unless you have done BNC solder-ons a
lot.  They are pain in the ass to make em work unless you have small
table vice or something to hold em while you solder.
