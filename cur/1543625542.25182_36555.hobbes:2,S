I am afraid this will get slightly problematic since I upgraded several system components (LVM update and some ext2->ext3 partition changes amongst others) which would probably make booting back into a working 2.2 system a rather adventurous task.
I think I'll try to do it tomorrow, however. Hope nothing gets broken.

As a matter of fact I keep getting the following kernel messages when accessing large chunks of data on ide2 or ide2 only while X is running:
Mar 21 09:56:41 localhost kernel: hde: drive not ready for command
Mar 21 09:56:41 localhost kernel: hde: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady 
                                                   SeekComplete DataRequest }
Mar 21 09:56:41 localhost kernel: hde: drive not ready for command
Mar 21 09:56:41 localhost kernel: hde: write_intr error1: nr_sectors=128, 
                                                                stat=0 xd0
Mar 21 09:56:41 localhost kernel: hde: write_intr: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Mar 21 09:56:41 localhost kernel: ide2: reset: success
Mar 21 09:56:41 localhost kernel: hde: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady                                                     SeekComplete DataRequest }
[...and so on, mostly without the write_intr error, just status errors...]
When X is not running (aka opencount 0 for nvdriver) all runs smoothly.
Alas, I can't find a way to assign that nv module to its own interrupt.
