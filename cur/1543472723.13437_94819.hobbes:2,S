Using swapfiles is still not so safe as swap partitions. Eg.:
# dd if=/dev/zero of=s1 bs=8192 count=1024
# ln s1 s2
# ls -l s*
-rw-r--r--   2 ankry    staff     8388608 Dec 22 13:16 s1
-rw-r--r--   2 ankry    staff     8388608 Dec 22 13:16 s2
# mkswap s1
Setting up swapspace, size = 8384512 bytes
# swapon s1
# swapon s2
######  ^^^ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! works !!!!!!!!
# cat /proc/swaps
Filename                        Type            Size    Used    Priority
/tmp/s1                         file            8188    0       -1
/tmp/s2                         file            8188    0       -2
You can double swapspace in the *same* file !
2.1.131
I think it's also possible with 2.0...
