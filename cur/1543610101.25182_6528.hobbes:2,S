Well, it's not really faster if you don't have that much spare disk
space.  You end up doing lots of resizes of the old fs, to gradually
make space for the new fs, and between each resize copy over some of the
files.  Oh, and lots of scary "dd" commands to slide the new fs down the
disk as it grows.
I know this because it's what I had to do, on two computers.
