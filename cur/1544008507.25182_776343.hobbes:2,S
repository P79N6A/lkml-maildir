I couldn't find anything on the list about this.
I've built and booted 28-rc7-mmotm-081203 on both x86_64 and ia64.  I
can ssh into the x86_64 platform fine.  On the ia64, I'm seeing sshd
[from RHEL5 distro] seg faulting.  [Same sshd worked on the
28-rc6-mmotm-081201 kernel.]
Has anyone else seen this?
