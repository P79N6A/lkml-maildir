Subject: I have an i82365-compatible PCMCIA PCI that is non-CardBus, I'd want that PCI detection for it was put back.

I have a PCMCIA controller Cirrus Logic CL 6729 that is PCCARD only,
not CardBus, *BUT* is PCI not ISA. Everywhere I seem to read that PCI
are all CardBus. There are some exceptions. I was locked to 2.3.36
because at first glance changes made in kernel didn't allow my
PCMCIA bridge to work and origin pcmcia-cs package doesn't compile
anymore (bridges, then later cards) modules for 2.3.37+.
I never compile the CARDBUS option since I don't have (and don't
want to include in kernel) the feature. Recently I read discussions
about PCMCIA & 2.3.46-pre2 and I decided to tell that there are
non-CardBus PCI bridges, in hope support for mine will not disappear ;)

Till 2.3.36, I don't use kernel source's PCMCIA options
Using the pcmcia-cs sourceforce, my card is detected as:
Feb 26 16:30:17 blackhole kernel: Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11
Feb 26 16:30:17 blackhole kernel:   kernel build: 2.3.36 unknown

Feb 26 16:30:18 blackhole cardmgr[5368]: watching 2 sockets
For later kernels I'm using these options:
CONFIG_ISA=y
CONFIG_PCI=y
CONFIG_PCMCIA=m
CONFIG_I82365=y
CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA=y
CONFIG_PCMCIA_PCNET=m
CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL=m
CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL_CS=m
I found that giving io=0x3000 to the i82365.o module made it
successfully detected (as ISA-to-PCMCIA device instead of 
PCI-to-PCMCIA) on 2.3.46+ (surely before).
Using the kernel native code on 2.3.47 and option io=0x3000:
Feb 24 04:17:39 blackhole kernel: Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11

Feb 24 04:17:40 blackhole kernel:     ISA irqs (default) = 3,5,7,10,11 polling interval = 1000 ms
on 2.3.46 I even got:

Anyways it's not very interesting to have lost PCI autodetection.
By the way: linux/drivers/pcmcia/i82365.c still has:
printk(KERN_INFO "Intel PCIC probe: ");
but all PCI probe code is removed. So some people would think their
PCI card was really probed (it wasn't at all), but not correctly
detected.
On the origin code: 
ftp://sourceforge.org/pcmcia/pcmcia-cs-3.1.11.tar.gz,
in pcmcia-cs-3.1.11/modules/i82365.c the PCI detection code is still
here, and there's somewhere a line describing my controller as PCI:
    { "Cirrus PD6729", IS_CIRRUS|IS_PCI, ID(CIRRUS, 6729) },
(but not IS_CARDBUS)

I hope it is destined very soon to be independant from CardBus.

Well my laptop (Clevo 862) is more than 2 years old.
that is past, not future hehe ;)
So would it be possible to reconsider the assertion that "today, PCI
PCMCIA is always CardBus" , and have functions in pci_socket.o used
by i82365.o if kernel has options CONFIG_PCI (CONFIG_PCMCIA_PCI?)
and CONFIG_82365 ?
