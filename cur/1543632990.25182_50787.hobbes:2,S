STOP!
What madness is this?
You have a damn mutex system call, don't introduce mode crap in /dev.
Do we create pipes by opening /dev/pipe? No. Do we have major and minor
numbers for sockets and populate /dev with them? No. And as a result,
there has _never_ been any sysadmin problems with either.
You already have to have a system call to bind the particular fd to the
futex _anyway_, so do the only sane thing, and allocate the fd _there_,
and get rid of that stupid and horrible /dev/futed which only buys you
pain, system administration, extra code, and a black star for being
stupid.
