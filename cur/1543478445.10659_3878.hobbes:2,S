	Any plan in adding support for it?, it seems very similar to the 
New Hauppage, works great with it if we ignore the problem with the mute,
so it should only need some changes in the tvcards struc, but I'm to new
to bttv to understand how to do it. I can provided a "patched" version
that works with the AVerMedia (it brokes every other card but I think it 
shows what might be done)
	Thanks, and keep working 2.2 is at the end of the tunnel (and I 
think I can see the light :-)
