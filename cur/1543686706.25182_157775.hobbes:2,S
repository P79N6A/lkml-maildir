That's what I find extremely annoying. Especially in the context of
Intel's trumpeted announcements about support for Linux (see the URL in
my previous E-mail). I mean, you either support Linux, or you
don't. Intel announced that support is coming and then hasn't delivered
it.
This is offtopic on this list, but frankly, I'm surprised why RedHat (or
any other Linux company for that matter) hasn't filed an unfair
competition suit yet. Intel's approach basically favors Microsoft over
other companies by giving them a year or so headway before anybody else
has a chance of getting the hardware supported. That surely sounds like
an unfair practice to me.

I keep dreaming about the day when I'll be able to have a modern laptop
with a stable Linux kernel. As for now, it has taken me (on one of my
laptops) about 1.5 years to get to a point where 2.4 works, most of my
hardware works, and software suspend (pretty much a requirement for
laptops) works. I'm not about to give that up easily, so I'm not that
eager to jump to 2.5/2.6.
Question time:
1. Will cpufreq make it into the standard 2.4 kernels?
2. If not, will Alan incorporate swsusp into -ac kernels? (given that
   -ac kernels seem to have cpufreq included)
3. Where does one get 2.4 cpufreq?
thanks,
