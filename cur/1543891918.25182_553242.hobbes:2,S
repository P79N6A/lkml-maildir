Andrew, Andrian,
If you really have the opinion of not going for major cleanups,
optimizations outside of original LZO code (basically a fork), then
there is no point in me continuing this work.
If you think otherwise, please let me know and I will post a newer
version with improvements from all these feedback I got.
Thanks,
Nitin
