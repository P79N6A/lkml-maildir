There aren't really any.  There are some unexpected ones - such as 
setting SYSENTER_CS during a context switch, but only if leaving v8086 
mode, which isn't a common case.  But most importantly, the MSR 
functions were challenging to get correct, because they combine two 
novel elements - 64 bit values, as well as non-C calling conventions.  
They were actually some of the first functions I inlined, because I knew 
there would be problems, and the solutions would yield more powerful 
inlining macros.

We currently don't support configurations without a TSC.  But we're not 
trying to virtualize the TSC without CPU support.  It is possible.  But 
I have no idea _why_ you would want to do such a thing.
