OK, someone should tell Tyan:
TYN TITAN-PRO V5.1  5/8/98
V5.1 Award BIOS for all Titan Pro series motherboards.  Includes a pci vga
irq setup item and support for UDMA33 HDD, Zip/LS120 floppy drives and CPU
1Mb cache.  Now supports the Oxygen 3D Video Card.  AWDFLASH.EXE included
in archive.
Is there any theory why it seemed to be working with the Western Digital
drive connected to the secondary controller?  That's what I found odd.  I
can supply boot info and hdparm output with that drive connected if it
would be informative.

I'll do this.  Right now the performance is terrible.
Thanks,
