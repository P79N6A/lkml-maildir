I've been watching this now for a couple of hours. Still no xruns. Max
latency has only gone up to 19uS, so this is all good. However the
thing I am seeing is that all my free memory has gone away and I've
now swapped out just a little nit. There was really no change in the
state of the machine, other than xscreensaver starting and running for
a while, which is standard for me. None the less here's the sort of
state things are in - 17uS right after booting, and only 19uS now.
That's good. But in the middle look at the change in memory statistics
during a one hour time period.

Now, I know these command line methods are probably frowned upon by
folks in the know so I'm happy to do this in a more rigorous way. (Is
it called valgrind?) Should free memory drop like that over time?
The only apps running were Aqualung, hdspmixer and Firefox. Is one of
them leaking, is the kernel leaking, or is this normal?
I will continue to let this run for another 4-6 hours today and hope I
catch another xrun. If not I'll start it up again tomorrow and
certainly will get something.
Thanks much,
Mark
