Setting the thread flag being an atomic operation, I would expect
setting/clearing it asynchronously from another thread to be a valid
behavior. The only race that I foresee happens if the code that uses the
thread flag reads it more than once and expects it to stay unchanged
between the reads.

Iterating on each thread running on the system and stopping them when
we start kernel tracing seems to have the same impact as throwing a
brick in a quiet lake. :) I would prefer not to do that if we can do
otherwise.
Here is a modified version where I add my test only in the path where we
know that we have work to do, therefore removing the supplementary test
from the performance critical path. Would it be more acceptable ?
Fix x86_64 TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE race in entry.S
When the flag is inactive upon syscall entry and concurrently activated before
exit, we seem to reach a state where the top of stack is incorrect upon return
to user space.
Fix this by fixing the top of stack and jumping to int_ret_from_sys_call if we
detect that thread flags has been modified.
We make sure that the thread flag read is coherent between our new test and the ALLWORK_MASK test by first saving it in a register used for both comparisons.
