We do actually serialize, but we do it _after_ the page has already been 
mapped back. Ie we do it for the dirty page case at rthe end of 
do_wp_page() and do_no_page() when we do the "set_page_dirty_balance()", 
but that's potentially too late - we've already mapped the page read-write 
into the address space.
That said, this means that only threaded apps should ever trigger any 
problems, which would seem to make it unlikely that this is the issue.
But Andrew: I don't think it's necessarily true that 
"try_to_free_buffers()" callers have all unmapped the page.
That seems to be true for vmscan.c (ie the shrink_page_list -> 
try_to_release_page -> try_to_release_buffers callchain), but what about 
the other callchains (through filesystems, or through "pagevec_strip()" or 
similar?) That pagevec_strip() is called from shrink_active_list(), I 
don't see that unmapping the pages..
