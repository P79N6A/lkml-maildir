Every -mm release if available via git://, as described in the release
announcements.
The scripts which do this are a bit cantankerous but I believe they do
work.
<tests it>
yup, 2.6.25-mm1 is there.

Fatal, I expect.  A tool which manages source-code files is just the wrong
paradigm.  I manage _changes_ against someone else's source files.

Really?  Doesn't Stephen handle all those problems?  It should be a clean

Don't know what to do about that, sorry.  An off-site git->http proxy might
work, but I doubt if anyone has written the code.
