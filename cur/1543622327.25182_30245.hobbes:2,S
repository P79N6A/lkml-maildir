   Interesting. I'd expect 25 myself ... then we'll definitely need two
   clock values in struct pci_bus - because the hi-speed one isn't always a
   double the low one - as shown by your example.
You only need one, the current active one.
If you think that hot-plug is an issue, the arch dependant could would
need to recalculate the "current bus speed" and all would be fine.
So why do we need two values?
