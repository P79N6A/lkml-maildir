On the other hand, you probably want to keep the 2.4.23(no-ext) directory
around as well, so you can boot a 2.4.23 kernel to clean up after a broken
build of a 2.4.23-fnux won't boot.
There's a reason why my /lib/modules has 6 subdirectories - I have 6
bootable kernels sitting around, Just In Case (well... OK. 2 spares would
probably be enough, but it's easier to do a "which -mm did the problem start?"
regression if you have the most recent few handy to try.. ;)
