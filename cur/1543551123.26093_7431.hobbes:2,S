In extreme cases, though, you could arrange things so the
machine only has 100K of RAM when it loads init, at which
point init tries running, say, rc.sysinit - and everything goes 
bang. Of course, a machine like that won't be very much use
anyway...
More realistically, though, I could be running with something
like init=/bin/sash - does your statically linked sash binary
fit in 70K? :-)
