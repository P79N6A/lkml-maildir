True, however, one might question the utility of supporting 
character disk device (raw) I/O on older IDE drives, as it is
primarily useful for high-performance disk I/O (e.g. for Oracle)
which is not a strength of IDE/EIDE/UDMA devices, and 
the block device can always be used on IDE devices, it's just 
slower (and may affect the page cache behavior).
