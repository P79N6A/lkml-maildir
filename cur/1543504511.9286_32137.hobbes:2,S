Just noticed this when I did a free command on a 2.2.11pre4 box:
$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        256992      20236     236756       9812       1864      11620
-/+ buffers/cache:       6752     250240
Swap:       130748          0     130748
$ 
That does not seem right to me. In particular the -/+ buffers/cache: under
free.
