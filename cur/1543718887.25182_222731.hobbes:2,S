Yes, and that has been done. Currently we have two such classtype  
(class task and network class) both supplied as independent "modules" 
atop the ckrm core.
And you are right again wrt the difference aspect. Each class registers 
the callbacks its interested in.

That is the "stickling" point. Yes, PAGG provides this feature that one 
can chain private data to the attach/detach callback. CKRM at this point 
does not do that as we do not see the need for multiple class 
associations in the core. Instead we can drive such things through the 
extended RBCE interface. Here you register callbacks to the task 
classtype to be notified of the ckrm events.
Since we do networking, PAGG is not sufficient for us as it only deals 
with processes. Hence we need our generic infrastructure at the core 
level. Sure we can try to modularize further to take the CKRM EVENTS 
out. Then potentially one could implement task types on top of PAGG on 
top of CKRM Events (which are needed anyway for other the task class 
associations), but then again PAGG brings nothing but another indirections.
It worthwhile to consider to bite the bullet and allow PAGG to enter its 
task class association chain (1 word) and allow CKRM its own. CKRM is 
going after the integrated resource schedulers, PAGG/CSA (afaik) does not.
