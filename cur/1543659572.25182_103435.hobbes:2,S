Last time must have been in an alternate reality.
You just overwrote all your arguments (argv[0] and others) and part of
the environment.
Try this for a change:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
extern char ** _environ;
int main(int cnt, char *argv[]) {
    char **eptr;
    for ( eptr = _environ; *eptr; ++eptr )
        printf("ENV before: %s\n", *eptr);
    strcpy(argv[0], "How-long-do-you-want-this-string-to-be?--is-this-long-enough?");
    for ( eptr = _environ; *eptr; ++eptr )
        printf("ENV after: %s\n", *eptr);
    pause();
    return 0;
}
Phil.
