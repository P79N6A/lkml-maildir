Using V0.7.34-01, I'm seeing the 'lock held at task exit time' bug. 
It's coming from a kernel module which in its init function creates a
thread.  The thread does a daemonize() and then goes to sleep waiting
on a semaphore which will be up'ed elsewhere.  In other words:
init_module()
 - sema_init(&sem, 0)
 - kernel_thread(thread_func, 0, 0);
thread_func()
 - daemonize()
 - down(&sem)
The BUG() (see below for log) seems to be triggered when insmod exits.  
BUG: insmod/2115, lock held at task exit time!
 [c883225c] {&tinfo[i].sem}

hm, PI interest held at exit time? Task:
