No. If my process comes along after yours, then grabs a big chunk of
memory, MY buggy app gets killed, to protect yours.
If your app started, immediately grabbed a chunk of memory, then slept
for a while, while mine comes along, does a load of calculations and
then allocates a buffer to put the results in, your process does get
killed to make room for mine. Legitimately so, IMO - it's MY process
which is doing something useful in this case, normally.

If just initialising the data arrays puts the system short of memory,
your process shouldn't be running at the moment anyway - your quota
should prevent it anyway, if you had a quota set properly.
Don't start huge simulations when the system is busy - that's
precisely when your process SHOULD be killed!
