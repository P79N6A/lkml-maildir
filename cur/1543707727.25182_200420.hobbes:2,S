I'm running udev for some time now on my main development
machine and it works (almost) great.
Thanks Greg and all the others who made it possible!
But I've a little issue left. My parallel port doesn't show
up in /udev. I guess it's because of missing sysfs support?
I'm running linux-2.6.3.
I did not find an entry for the parallel port in sysfs.
If I create the device node manually I can access lp.
