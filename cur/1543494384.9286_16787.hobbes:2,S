Dear Experts,
looking at kernels 2.1.75 and 2.2.2 I noticed two changes I'm wondering
about.
1. former member timeout in task_struct in 2.1 seems to be an extern
parameter to calls now
2. there has been added a function schedule_timeout
Could someone please give me the reasons for those changes or provide me
with a hint for further reading in the archives?
TIA,
Ralf
