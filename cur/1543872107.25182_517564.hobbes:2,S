You can get a similar effect on 4kb platforms by specifying slub_min_order=2 on bootup.
This means that we have to rely on your patches to allow higher order 
allocs to work reliably though. The higher the order of slub the less 
locking overhead. So the better your patches deal with fragmentation the 
more we can reduce locking overhead in slub.
