I tried the mentioned patch, with a modification for my CPU type, but
still get the problem:
"Jan 20 21:30:23 ksyrium kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal,
correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
Jan 20 21:30:23 ksyrium kernel: MCE: startbank = 1, vendor : 0, x86 = 6,
model = 9, mask = 5.
Jan 20 21:30:23 ksyrium kernel: Bank 1: f200000000000185"
As you can see, I added a little extra debugging info. Here is the
relevant portion of the code:
" if ((boot_cpu_data.x86_vendor == X86_VENDOR_AMD && boot_cpu_data.x86
== 6) || (boot_cpu_data.x86_vendor == X86_VENDOR_INTEL &&
boot_cpu_data.x86 == 6 && boot_cpu_data.x86_model == 9 &&
boot_cpu_data.x86_mask == 5))
startbank = 1;"
Comments would be appreciated.
