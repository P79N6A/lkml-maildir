the original e-mail should have said 2.4.17-pre2 so it should have looked
like:
I basically just copied the source files from the xfree86 4.1.0 nv driver
and
then tweaked the rest of the rivafb files to get it to work. The patch is
against the 2.4.17-pre2 tree. I'd like anyone with a geforce3 card at their
disposal to please test this out and lemme know what you think.
