hi all
i'm trying to understand the kernel COW system, and i'm having trouble
in one spot.
handle_pte_fault() locks the kernel immediately, and either unlocks it
by itself or relies on do_no_page(), do_swap_page(), or do_wp_page()
to take care of it.  my problem is with do_wp_page().
i can't see how the global kernel lock is released if any of the gotos
to end_wp_page or bad_wp_page are taken.  the only thing i can think of
is that it is released in __get_free_page() somehow, but i couldn;t
see it.
any clues would be greatly appreciated..
