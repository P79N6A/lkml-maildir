Well whatever bug it is, it's in Linus's tree now.  Happens for me too.
I traced the failure down as far as acpi_processor_get_performance_info(),
where it's failing here:
	status = acpi_get_handle(pr->handle, "_PCT", &handle);
	if (ACPI_FAILURE(status)) {
		ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT((ACPI_DB_INFO,
				  "ACPI-based processor performance control unavailable\n"));
		return_VALUE(-ENODEV);
	}
