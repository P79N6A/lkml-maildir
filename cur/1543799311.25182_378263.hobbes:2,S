Yes.

We did look at that. Cases RUSAGE_CHILDREN and RUSAGE_SELF are always called by the 
current task, so we can avoid tasklist locking there.
getrusage for non-current tasks are always called with RUSAGE_BOTH.
We ensure we  always take the siglock for RUSAGE_BOTH case, so that the
p->signal* fields are protected and take the tasklist_lock only if we have 
to traverse the tasklist hashlist. Isn't this safe?
Thanks,
