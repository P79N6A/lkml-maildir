To be able to do that, they have to have extra capabilities in the first
place. And under a reasonable capability system they won't unless
specifically granted to them, not just by being run by root or something
like that.

This means placing unrestricted power at the disposal of whoever cracks
sperl or sbash or..., and as these are (by their very nature) complex
programs, this is likely to happen. If the capabilities are granted to the
process running the interpreter that is running the script, the interpreter
itself isn't a vulnerability except through a capable script (which is
pointless for an attacker).
