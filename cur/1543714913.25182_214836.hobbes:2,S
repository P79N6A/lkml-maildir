Well, that's one problem with using POINTERs, but I think perhaps the
more serious one is that a lot of HPC code is written by scientists
who aren't programmers, and who still think in FORTRAN77.

Well, indeed.  Note that this "demand paging" set of patches don't
actually do paging out to disk - they just do on-demand allocation of
physical hugepages, rather than prefaulting them all.  My only real
interest in it is that part of the mechanism is identical to that
needed for COW (handle_hugetlb_mm_fault(), in particular).
