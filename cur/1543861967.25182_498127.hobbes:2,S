Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Improve swap page error handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Improve the error handling when writes fail to a swap page. 
Currently, the kernel will repeatedly retry the write which is unlikely
to ever succeed. Instead we allow the pages to be unused and then marked
as bad at which prevents reuse. It should hopefully be suitable for
testing in -mm.

I think you were cc'd on some of it but you never commented. Anyhow,
I've reworked this patch series based on your comments. The hints were
appreciated, thanks. This was the way I'd originally hoped to be able to
work things, I just couldn't find the right way to do it.

I have a swap block driver where hardware write errors are more likely
and hence have a need to handle them more gracefully than IO loops. It
seems like a good idea to avoid the IO loops anyway.

You can't proceed to do that until you're able to identify the bad pages
so this would be a necessary first step towards that, yes.

Agreed, see the following 1/4. 
Patch 4/4 in this series is optional but its appended in hope. It cleans
up code at the expense of what looks like a performance optimisation. I
found the code as it stands rather confusing as a newcomer to that code.
