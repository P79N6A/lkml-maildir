We figured removing error handling was not safe, the previous post was 
only reporting test results to ask for more suggestions.  I have now 
tested your suggested patch above and it seems to crash in the same way 
as originally.

This makes me curious, the other elevators lacked this type of error 
checking.  Did this mean they were possibly allowing data corruption to 
happen with buggy drivers like this?  Kind of scary!  We were lucky to 
test this now, because this was one of the first FC kernels that 
included cfq by default.
Do you have any advice regarding the atomic type removal problem that we 
experienced from our previous post?
