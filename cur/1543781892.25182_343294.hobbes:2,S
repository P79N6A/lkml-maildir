I've never heard of this before. However, cheking the list shows that 
every vendor which has a "Wrong ID" entry also a normal one. So my guess 
is that "wrong ID" means that somewhere in the process of putting the 
PCI ID (during the design of the device) someone mistook which ID to 
put. So this would mean that your device doesn't have the official ID of 
VIA, but it uses an unofficial one (famous enough to be listed though). 
Nothing to worry about.

Well, as I said before, it's just pure guess, but it's cool to invent 
stories ;-)
