It a question, how to process cache flush errors correctly. A cache flush 
error reported for one filesystem may belong to the data written by other 
filesystem. So should some flag "there was an error" be set for all 
partitions and report it to every filesystem when it does cache flush? Or 
record the time of the last error in the driver and let the filesystem 
query it (so that the filesystem can tell if the error happened before or 
after it was mounted).
BTW. how does SCSI report cache flush errors? Does it report them on 
SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command or does it report them on defered senses?
Another point is that unless the sector remap table is full, there should 
be no cache flush errors.

I meant for example loose cable or so --- does it make sense to retry 
indefinitely (until the admin plugs the cable or unmounts the filesystem) 
or return error to the filesystem after few retries?
