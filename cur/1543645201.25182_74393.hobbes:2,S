kmem_cache_destroy() is falsely reporting
"kmem_cache_destroy: Can't free all objects" in 2.5.39. I have
verified my code was freeing all allocated items correctly.
Reverting this chunk :
-                       list_add(&slabp->list, &cachep->slabs_free);
+/*                     list_add(&slabp->list, &cachep->slabs_free);            */
+                       if (unlikely(list_empty(&cachep->slabs_partial)))
+                               list_add(&slabp->list, &cachep->slabs_partial);
+                       else
+                               kmem_slab_destroy(cachep, slabp);
and the problem goes away. I haven't investigated why.
This is with CONFIG_SMP, !CONFIG_PREEMPT
