Make sure your BIOS is up to date. If so, post your dmesg output and the 
contents of /proc/mtrr. There are a number of Intel boards which 
have/had BIOS bugs where the BIOS didn't set up the MTRRs to mark all 
RAM as write-back. This results in the last bit of memory being 
uncacheable and causes a major performance drop.
