Hi,
thanks for your answers. I didn't know of UUIDs and user defined labels and 
you're right, it is much more flexible. But, according to man fstab, it is 
currently only supported by ext2 and xfs. What about the others?
One last note about the term "current hd" I used: I did not define it as the 
hd where the root fs is located, but I said that it should be defined by the 
kernel at startup. That is, it could be any disk. The default could have 
been, for example, the root fs.

Do you really think, that it is such a specialized case? I know that Linux is 
used much more on servers than on desktop computers, but I suppose we all 
hope that Linux' market share on desktops can grow further.
cö,
