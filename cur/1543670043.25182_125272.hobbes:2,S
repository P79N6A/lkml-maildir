Subject: compiling 2.4.21-pre7-ac1 with quota support disabled

When quota support is disabled, file fs/dquot.c is not compiled;
however, it contains function sync_dquots_dev() which is called twice
from fs/quota.c.  This causes fs.o to fail to link.  #ifdeffing out the
two calls in quota.c seems to do no harm, but I haven't tested it,
other than to boot the resulting kernel and run some file operations.
