I've implemented this in another operating system before.  Permissions are
handled by a security manager daemon which holds the various keys that the
machine trusts and what they are trusted with.  Executables are signed by
one or more keys, and the executable contains the permission information. 
When a program needs to be executed, the security manager is consulted,
and permission mask of the executable is essentially ANDed with the
permission mask of that particular key, granting access.  Allows copying
privledged executables freely by any user, to any machine, as well as
executing over NFS.  You could also then force all executables to be
signed, as well. 
I wonder if this can be implemented elegantly under Linux?
