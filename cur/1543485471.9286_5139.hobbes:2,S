Am I the only one seing this? For an iso9660 mounted filesystem through
the loop device (on top of ext2fs)
find /mnt/loop -type f -exec cat {} > /dev/null \;
gives:
procs                  memory    swap        io    system         cpu
 r b w  swpd  free  buff cache  si  so   bi   bo   in   cs  us  sy  id

The same command after the files have been copied to an ext2fs partition
on the same physical disk gives:
procs                  memory    swap        io    system         cpu
 r b w  swpd  free  buff cache  si  so   bi   bo   in   cs  us  sy  id

I understand it isn't fair to compare iso9660/loop/ext2fs to ext2fs but
> 3 times slower? I have re-run the test for both cases 3 times (for the
whole 650 MB). What is going on here? Any takers?
One more thing. I can make my box totally unresponsive by running a cp
-r from/to UDMA to/from UW-SCSI. A totally new phenomen to me. Am I
alone with this one too?
TIA.
