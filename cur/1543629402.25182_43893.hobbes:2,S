Me too.  HP's zx1 platform also has a rather giant hole above the 1GB
boundary.  I don't know the exact reasons for this hole, but it's
related to the fact that (many) PCI devices need <4GB memory.
The current solution for zx1 is to place the mem_map in virtual
memory.  This obviously increases TLB pressure when touching lots of
mem_map[] entries randomly, but I haven't really seen any benchmarks
so far (real or artificial) where this has a signifcant performance
effect.  The nice part of this approach is that it is a rather general
solution, provided the kernel's page-table mapped address space is
sufficiently big.
