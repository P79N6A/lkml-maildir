Why? What do you want to achieve? Performances? I think it make no sense
as far as the IOAPIC will run as now (and the current setting of the
IO-APIC is sure the best for general purposes). I think that to give it a
_sense_ you should at least also drive all irqs of your machine to the
other CPU (it's possible setting the IOAPIC in a different way, and in
such different way the IOAPCI will also allow you to select different
priority for irqs).
