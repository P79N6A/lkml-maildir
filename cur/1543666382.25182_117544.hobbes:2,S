I've seen reports of ridiculous bugs in Win98 that make it crash if you try
to set our timezone (Chile/Continental), so they run it on UTC and fix up
the time for summer/winter, if they even care about the right date (many
people just don't bother setting up the clock of their systems). A large
site around here had a hard time analyzing a breakin because their server
systems were all running on wildly inaccurate clocks, so that correlating
logs was a huge pain. For laughs, just check the origin date of the email
you get.
