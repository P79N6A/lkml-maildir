I may be wrong, but I think a reader never look at next_fd.
next_fd is only used (read/written) by a 'writer', with file_lock hold,  in 
locate_fd(), copy_fdtable() and get_unused_fd(), __put_unused_fd()

Yes, sure, but those fields are not part of the embedded struct fdtable

This simple bench can be used, I got good results on a dual opteron machine. 
As Opterons have prety good NUMA links (Hypertransport), I suspect older 
hardware should obtain even better results.
$ gcc -O2 -o bench bench.c -lpthread
$ ./bench -t 2 -l 10   # run the bench with 2 threads for 10 seconds.
2 threads, 10 seconds, work_done=1721627
To run it with a small fdset (no more than 3 + (nbthreads) files opened)
$ ./bench -s -t 2 -l 10
2 threads, 10 seconds, work_done=1709716
Unfortunatly I cannot boot the dual opterons at the moment to try to move 
next_fd close to file_lock
