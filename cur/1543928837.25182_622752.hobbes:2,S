Sorry if I was a bit harsh, but no change to the in-kernel API [1] 
could ever be called a regression since we do not have a stable 
in-kernel API.
And what annoyed was that this was one of at least 3 ongoing 
linux-kernel threads where people tried to bring the notion that any 
part of the in-kernel API had any kind of stability.
