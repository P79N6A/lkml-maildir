Will try... I have upgraded to ubuntu edgy yesterday, where I think some
thing changed (it's a 2.16.17-based kernel). I had no time to test it
more thoroughly, but the change is that now (standard edgy kernel): 
- only the first function is recognized
- if i start cardmgr, without the .cis, the two function are recognized
but now I *do* have the irq problem, and the modem is all-time-busy.
If tomorrow my little one sleeps a bit more, I will try to test your
patch. I hope I'll find how to apply it to that kernel, I do not want to
change it (for the first time my vaio suspend to ram and my  wifi works
without ndiswrapper!).
