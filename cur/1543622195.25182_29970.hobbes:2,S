Absolutely not.

About 95% in our source base.  You can actually run a script over the
tree, and retry all the merges with the CVS alg and the BK alg.  The BK
alg automerges about 95% of the ones where CVS would not (could not).
These results are typical, in fact, the percentages go up as the number
of parallel developers go up.
