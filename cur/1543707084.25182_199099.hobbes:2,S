Hi,

So you overclock your CPU but then throttle it down... strange, but well...

It's just a change of appearance -- the cpufreq driver uses the theoretical
speed of the CPU for its calculations; the actual CPU speed isn't
affected. You can verify this by looking at /proc/cpuinfo which still tells
3124.376 MHz.
By doing so it becomes easier to enter different frequencies e.g. into
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed -- on my desktop, typing in
1200000 is easier than 12121224... [*]

[*] The _actual_ CPU speed should be used on all cpufreq drivers where this
specific CPU frequency has implications to external components, e.g. LCD,
memory or pcmcia devices. Where only the _frequency ratio_ is of importance
[for loops_per_jiffy and friends] such "rounding" is acceptable, as long as
the ratio is constant.
