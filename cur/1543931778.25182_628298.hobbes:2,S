Yes, we use uninitialized data. But it's not a leak in any useful
sense. To the extent the previous data is secret, this actually
improves our entropy.
It's getting folded into the random number pool, where it will be
impossible to recover it unless you already know what was in the
pool. And if you know what's in the pool, you've already broken into
the kernel.
But I'm sympathetic to making Valgrind happy.

That's hideous. How about a memset instead:
       /* clear uninitialized bytes at the end to make valgrind happy */
       memset((char *)tmp + bytes, 0, -bytes & 3);
Also, don't bother putting dates or the like in comments. We've got a
version control system for that.

And that change is broken..

..because it makes this line wrong. We have to add precisely the
number of bytes returned by extract_entropy to keep the books
balanced.
