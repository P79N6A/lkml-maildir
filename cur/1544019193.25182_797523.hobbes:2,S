So you can have priority over kernel threads.... Sounds very dangerous.

Never used -rt. This is an issue seen in regular kernels.

Run a loop reading tsc and see the variances?
In HPC apps a series of processors have to sync repeatedly in order to
complete operations. An event like cache cleaning can cause a disturbance
in one processor that delays this sync in the system as a whole. And
having it run at offsets separately on all processor causes the
disturbance to happen on one processor after another. In extreme cases all
syncs are delayed. We have seen this effect have a major delay on HPC app
performance.
Note that SLAB scans through all slab caches in the system and expires
queues that are active. The more slab caches there are and the more data
is in queues the longer the process takes.

The cross-bar queues are a significant problem because they mean operation
on objects that are relatively far away. So the time spend in cache
cleaning increases significantly. But as far as I can see SLQB also has
cross-bar queues like SLAB. SLUB does all necessary actions during the
actual allocation or free so there is no need to run cache cleaning.
