ah ... that makes sense. It is most likely level-triggered IO-APIC
interrupts that break. Could you try to turn off redirection for every
interrupt that says 'IO-APIC-level' in /proc/interrupts - does that
stabilize things? (besides the 'noapic' workaround you already
discovered.) How does your /proc/interrupts look like btw?
the 'XT-PIC' interrupt controller (i8259A) is fine for redirection. (and
that's what i used for testing almost exclusively.)
