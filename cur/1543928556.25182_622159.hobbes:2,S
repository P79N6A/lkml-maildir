Matthew,
Yes, as I mentioned, our applications are built in 32-bit environment
(except for ia64).
We may see a different behavior if we build it in 64-bit for x86-64. 
Regards.
Bo Yang

Are you saying the application is built 32-bit for x86-64?
Is it true that, if this application were built 64-bit for x86-64, you
would have the same situation as with ia64?
