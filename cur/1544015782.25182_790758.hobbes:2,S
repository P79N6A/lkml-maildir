Linus,
Please pull two dlm patches for 2.6.29-rc1 from:
 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/teigland/dlm.git for-linus
The first fixes incorrect seq_file usage in the debugfs lock dump.  I had
to rework all the seq ops which created the large diff.
The second isn't a fix, but changes an rwlock (used prominently in the
first patch) into a spinlock.
Thanks,
Dave
