What is significant is not the affect of code size on modern 
architectures, code size hurts developers as the code becomes very hard 
to make deep changes to.  It is very important to carefully design your 
code to be easy to change.  This is why we tossed the V3 code and wrote 
V4 from scratch using plugins at every conceivable abstraction layer.  I 
think V4 will be our last rewrite from scratch because of our plugins, 
and because of how easy we find the code to work on now.
I think XFS is going to stagnate over time based on the former 
developers who have told me how hard it is to work on the code.  
Christoph probably disagrees, and he knows the XFS code far better than 
I.;-)
