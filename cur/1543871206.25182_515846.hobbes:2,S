This patch has been queued at test.kernel.org (thanks Andy Whitcroft).
Here is a summary of the first few benchmarks from those tests rsdl 0.26 vs 
mainline 2.6.20 (However much it is that you value these particular 
benchmarks...) on amd64 4x:
Kernbench (lower elapsed is better);
=========
2.6.20:
Elapsed: 103.058s User: 351.974s System: 36.474s CPU: 376.6%
2.6.20-rsdl:
Elapsed: 102.848s User: 359.186s System: 36.666s CPU: 384.6%
tbench (higher is better):
======
2.6.20:
Throughput 165.5 MB/sec 1 procs
2.6.20-rsdl:
Throughput 261.418 MB/sec 1 procs
reaim (higher is better):
