That would work if the alternate kernel is suspend-enabled. Suspend2
handles that case nicely and I'm sure swsusp will handle it as well
(although exactly what it does, I'm not sure. It used to panic IIRC).
If the mistakenly booted kernel isn't suspend enabled, however, you need
a more generic method of removing the image, such as mkswapping the
storage device. This is what I was speaking of.
