I don't think that's true. valgrind can only detect uninitialized 
local variables in one special case (first use of the stack region).
But as soon as you reuse stack which is pretty common it won't 
be able to detect the next uninitialized use in a stack frame. 
Luckily the compilers do a reasonable job at detecting them at build time.
And static/global variables are never uninitialized in C.
