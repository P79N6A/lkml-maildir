Yes.  ISO C only defines pointer arithmetic with in arrays.  
I believe gnu C makes it a well defined case.
Currently we do not appear to have any problems on i386.
But I have at least one case of code that is shared between
i386 and x86_64 and it is appropriate to use __pa_symbol on
x86_64.
So I added __pa_symbol for that practical reason.
I would have no problems with generalizing this but I wanted to
at least make it possible to use the concept on i386.
I will be happy to add in the assembly magic, if you don't have
any other problems with this.
