G'day all,
I got this in my logs this morning.
My machine was locked hard.
Kernel : Fresh 2.2.1
Uptime : 5 days.
Other problems : Every now then when I reboot the machine it says it is
unable to unmount '/' because device is busy.
Feb 10 02:38:45 tt2 kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at
virtual address 00000004
Feb 10 02:38:45 tt2 kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 0425e000, `r3 = 0425e000
Feb 10 02:38:45 tt2 kernel: *pde = 00000000
Feb 10 02:38:45 tt2 kernel: Oops: 0002
Feb 10 02:38:45 tt2 kernel: CPU:    0
At this point the machine had locked up and nothing else was in the logs.
I know this may be useless but something is sometimes better than nothing.
Cheers Mof.
