Yes, and the above command is equivalent to `loadunimap def'.
    I fixed the problem by adding this to the profile
    UNIMAP=iso01.uni
    export UNIMAP
    I haven't had a problem with this since.
    It seems that if it doesn't see that environment variable it defaults
    to some crappy anglo unimap.
Since UNIMAP does not occur in the kbd sources, you must be using
some other version of setfont, perhaps the one from console-tools.
When discussing things, please mention versions.
