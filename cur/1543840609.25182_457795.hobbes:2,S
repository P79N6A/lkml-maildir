Using sky2 on Intel motherboard and git bisect. But Jesse found same problem
on e1000. Bisect was relatively fast since it was either base net code or driver.
Starting with 2.6.17, everything worked, and latest was busted.
	git bisect start net drivers/net/sky2.c
Test was ipv6 slogin, then run dmesg. If that worked then run top and cause
lots of other traffic by just doing a firefox open-tabs to blast lots of connections.
Wanted to induce tcp-ipv6 to get congested.
