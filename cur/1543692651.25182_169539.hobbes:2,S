I have written a patch against the linux 2.4.x kernel and I want to port 
it to the 2.6.x Kernel now.
What it is
- ----------
The trackpad on the MacIntosh iBook notebooks have a feature that 
prevents unintended trackpad input while typing on the keyboard. There 
are no mouse-moves or mouse-taps for a short period of time after each 
keystroke.
I thougt that was a nice-to-have for my i386 notebook and have 
implemented it ( with some very important help of other people, namely 
Torsten Foertsch ).
This feature is fully configurable via a proc entry.
How it currently works
- ----------------------
In the 2.4.x kernel the handling of keyboard and PS/2 mouse where both 
done in linux/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c. So it was easy to apply a patch 
without touching other files.
It simply stores a timestamp whenever a key event occurs. If a mouse 
event occurs it compares the timestamp of the mouse event with stored 
timestamp of the key event. If the delta of these timestamps is less 
than a treshold value, than this mouse event is simply discarded. There 
where some things more to consider about, but I think you have the idea.
Where I need help now
- ---------------------
Since I do not want to touch the keyboard driver, I wonder if there is 
better way to get the timestamp when the last keyboard event occured?
Maybe a function call, a callback function where I can register to the 
be notified when a event occurs, a global accessible variable, a proc 
entry or something like that.
Any ideas ?
