It could be. One possible way:
1. your system is clogged with dust
2. gcc runs the CPU hard, generating lots of heat
3. the heat causes crashes
4. a new Linux version that sets a Cyrix-specific power-saving mode
5. your heat problems go away, and so do the crashes
Another possible way:
1. you have buggy motherboard or disk hardware
2. when you swap, gcc gets corrupted by the hardware
3. you get a new Linux kernel that has a bug work-around
4. your problems go away
Yet another way:
1. your room is hot, your computer is near a huge motor...
2. you upgrade to Linux 2.2.12 and move your computer
3. soon you realize that the crashes are gone
4. you credit the kernel, but location was the problem
