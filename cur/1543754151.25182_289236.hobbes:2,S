Subject: [PATCH] [Bug 3736] Bug in tty_io.c after changes between 2.6.9-rc1-bk1 and 2.6.9-rc1-bk2

Tried to fix a bug 
 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3736
which appeared between kernels 2.6.9-rc1-bk1 and 2.6.9-rc1-bk2.
Suceeded to localize it to part of changes in drivers/char/tty_io.c.
I guess changes were according changelog:

  [PATCH] /dev/ptmx open() fixes
  
  If tty_open() fails for a normal serial device, we end up doing cleanups
  that should only happen for failed open of /dev/ptmx.  The results are
  not pretty - devpts et.al.  end up very confused.  That's what gave
  problems with ptmx.
  
  This splits ptmx file_operations from the normal case and cleans up both
  tty_open() and (new) ptmx_open().  Survived serious beating.
-----------------------------------
Finally located that a problem seems to be a simple typo (

 }
 
At least as I tested, it fixes the problem on one of systems on which I 
tested.
