Btw, I can re-pull and just do a rebase and fix things up by hand myself, 
so if you don't want to, I can clean up this sequence myself. But I just 
don't want it to become a habit, so I want to make sure that at least in 
the future these things won't look as horrible.
In case you wonder what the easiest way to fix things up is: just export 
the series as a mbox ("git log -p --stat --pretty=email linus.. > mbox") 
and then just edit the single mbox file to remove crud. Then you can 
re-apply it with "git am".
Of course, with git you can do it in a million different ways: You could 
do it with "git format-patch" or with "git rebase -i" too, for example, 
but exporting it as an mbox means that you can do it in one single editing 
session, which is how at least I personally work. Much nicer than having 
to handle each commit individually.
