Hi Jens,
I guessed from the oops that you might have an idea what's causing this oops 
on shutdown/unmount. The git version (describe), a screenshot showing the 
oops, a config, and dmesg for a booted kernel are available from:
http://devzero.co.uk/~alistair/oops-20071031/
I went back to -rc1 and it still happens there too. If you need any more 
information or want me to bisect it, please let me know.
