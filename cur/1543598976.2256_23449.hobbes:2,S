Some time ago, I posted a few messages that got rejected by the moderator.
This, hopefully wont.
I was having problems involvine my kernel (2.4.5) dying when i would try
to ssh from my webserver to my local work station (using scp).
Here is what i have discovered so far:
iptables -A INPUT -j LOG -p tcp -i eth0 --syn --dport 22 -m limit --limit
2/s causes a lock up when i try and SSH
Is this a bug or just my missuse of the limit match?
