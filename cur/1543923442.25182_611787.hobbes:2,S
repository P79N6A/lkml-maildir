That is no excuse for extreme verbosity.  It makes ls(1) displays ugly, 
it makes diffstat ugly, it causes long pathnames to be truncated in 
various display-oriented programs.
Pick a shorter word like probes or profile or what... or better yet... 
just leave most things in their current directories.
Shuffling files around just to put them into directories with extra-long 
names is highly undesirable.
