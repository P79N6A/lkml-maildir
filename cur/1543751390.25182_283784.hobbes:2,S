Hello,
we've noticed that in recent 2.6.10 kernels that the inter_module_
routines (such as inter_module_get) are marked deprecated. it appears
that the __symbol_ routines (such as __symbol_get) are intended as the
replacement routines.
unfortunately, __symbol_get is only exported as a GPL symbol (I see a
reference to a _gpl verion in module.h, but no definition). is this
intentional? will there be a non-gpled version of an equivalent
routine?
Thanks,
Terence
