Not having had the problem of jailing things for almost a decade, I
haven't been following this field, but certainly after looking at POSIX
and chroot, I don't think we can both be secure and compliant. Adding
jail() would be a better approach, preferably with a BSD-compatible API so
people could move programs here.
I have been doing some reading on UML, and it sounds as if that could be
at least as secure as jail, but it is almost certainly higher overhead. I
want to try running multiple machines in UML and see how well it works. If
disk is the only issue it's cheap enough to to have enough per
application, but I doubt if it's practical per-user in most cases.
