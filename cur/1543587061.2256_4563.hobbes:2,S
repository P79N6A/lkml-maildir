	You are tinkering with the wrong value. FD_SETSIZE affects fd_sets used in
the 'select' system call. If you don't use select (and you shouldn't) it's
not an issue.
	Also, tampering with the system-wide limits is the wrong approach too.
There is no problem in the kernel for you to fix.
	What you are hitting is a per-process resource limit. Read the man pages on
'setrlimit' or the bash help on 'ulimit'.
