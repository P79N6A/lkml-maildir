Which is, IMO, a bug, albeit a kind of specification bug, given the 
way the drivers tend to be written. An Ethernet link can be up or 
down independent of the logical up/down state of the interface, and 
with most drivers the link state is hidden as long as the interface 
is logically down.
One place where you might want to know: an HA system where a 
redundant interface is available to be configured in place of an 
active interface. We'd like to know the state of the link on the 
backup interface, which is logically down, as an indication that it's 
hooked up and ready to go.
It's unfortunate that the two conditions are conflated by most net drivers.
