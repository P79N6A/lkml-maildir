I need it to access chip-specific configuration registers on a PCI 
Express card.  It's under NDA so that's all I can say.
This will become more common as PCI Express becomes more common, as 
well.  It's largely only luck that we haven't run into more cases like 
this.  Most PCI-Ex devices, like most PCI devices, just don't need a 
whole lot of PCI configuration space.

Can you then please share the list of known BIOS bugs?
All I have to do on my machines is work around the disable-mmconfig 
code, and things start working.
