The zero_id stuff is required to differentiate between the struct 
shmid_kernel of a "real" shared memory segment and one that
represents a /dev/zero mapping. This is used in shm_swap_core(),
for accounting purposes, but that can be changed by adding a 
new flag to shm_swap_core. The more important use is in
shm_nopage().

Would this need to be done for each /dev/zero mapping? If so, then 
I prefer the way the code is right now, since the interference with
"real" shared memory is minimal. I was also trying to look for a way 
to prevent the zshmid_kernel hacks in shmat/shmctl (including setting
strict permissions), but couldn't come up with one ... Tell me in more
detail what you are suggesting here.

I do not believe there is any good reason to expose the special shared
memory segment used as a place holder for all /dev/zero mappings to users
via ipc* commands. This special segment exists only because we 
want to reduce kernel code duplication, and all the zshmid_kernel/
zero_id checks just make sure that regular shared memory works
pretty much the way it did before. (One thing I am unhappy about
is that this special segment eats up a shm id, but that's probably
not too bad). 
Thanks.
