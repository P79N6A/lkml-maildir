This may be completely off-track but I've seen it cause wierd problems
in the past, so worth checking - was the directory you were in when the
machine crashed one that still existed as far as the file system was
concerned?
To test this, try the following...
	# cd /tmp
	# mkdir X
	# cd X
	# mv ../X ../Y
	# cd `pwd`
	bash: /tmp/X: No such file or directory
	#
...and then perform the test. As far as the test is concerned, the
current directory is /tmp/X but, as shown above, the file system reports
that the said directory doesn't exist, and it's not hard to work out
that you're actually in /tmp/Y instead.
Best wishes from Riley.
