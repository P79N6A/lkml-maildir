Subject: [PATCH] show_task() and thread_saved_pc() fix for x86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/11/10/197

	* thread_saved_pc() on x86 returns (thread->esp)[3]. Bogus, since the
third word from the stack top has absolutely nothing to return address of
any kind. Correct value: (thread->esp)[0][1] - ebp is on top of the stack
and the rest is obvious. Current code gives completely bogus addresses -
try to say Alt-SysRq-T and watch the show.
	* kernel/sched::show_state() used the wrong check for process being
on some CPU - p==current is nice for UP, but on SMP it's obviously wrong.
Moroever, nothing prevents schedule() another CPU while we are going through
the process state. Fix: show_state() grabs runqueue_lock, show_task() checks
p->has_cpu instead of p == current.
	Please, apply.
							Cheers,
								Al
