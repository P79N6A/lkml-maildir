Thanks Albert! Actually I was aware of this patch (saw it in the
archives), but, it seemed to me that this patch hadn't made it into
the standard kernel (2.4.0-test8 didn't have it), so I thought I might
bring up this issue once more. I just learned from Alan, that he added
it in 2.2.18pre, so I'll test that one and if it works, I'll be all
happy :-).
