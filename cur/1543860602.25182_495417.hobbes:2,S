Subject: [PATCH] cdrom: longer timeout for "Read Track Info" command
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have a DVD combo drive and a CD in which the
"READ TRACK INFORMATION" command (implemented in the
cdrom_get_track_info() function) takes about 7 seconds to run.
The current implementation of cdrom_get_track_info() uses the
default timeout of 5 seconds.  So here's a patch that increases
the timeout from 5 to 15 seconds.
The drive in question is a TSSTcorpCD/DVDW SN-S082D, and I have
a Silicon Image 680A adapter, in case that's of interest.
