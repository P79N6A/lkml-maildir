Hi,
1st you should put this information on 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
(choose enter a new bug, may choose Category ACPI with component
config-interrupts ) for better organization, instead make your own bug
documentation.
The documentation is very good  you should attach the same information
on bugzilla
your bug kept me the attention because on bad interrupts  you have :
21:     100000   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ohci1394
Exactly oops on 100000 interrupts, I had seen this before .
I have my bug on 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6419
which one of the bugs looks like similar to yours. 
So, You are saying with kernel 2.6.16.31 with xen 3.0.2, you don't have
this problem , I like to try it, how or where you build this Xenified
kernel ? 
Thanks,
