Hopefully on an idle system there isn't any access, so there isn't any
atime impact. It would be nice if the atime write was very lazy, as in
only when the file is closed or something. Like an atimeonclose option.

Someone will have to explain that one, in a normal mount I would not
expect an idle system to be doing anything on the filesystems.
