Me too.  I've been here before, I was one of about 8 people who actually
knew that AT&T should have won the BSD lawsuit because I diffed the code.
And you can't diff it with a perl script, that simply doesn't work.  The
only real ways that I know of are
    a) have a human do it, function by function
    b) compile the code to an expression tree and then diff the expression
       trees.
