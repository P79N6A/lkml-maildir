I applied this patch this weekend, and, wholla (how the hell is this
"word" supposed to be spelled?), I've been running an 2.2.13pre15+ikd
with SOFTLOCKUP enabled for over 2 days now.  Looks like that fixes
the SOFTLOCKUP stability problems, at least as far as I can tell.
I'll run it for a few more days before booting up 2.2.13 to test that.
Good job!
BYW, the latest IKD patch does not apply cleanly to 2.2.13 -- is there
an ikd patch that does?  I didn't take the time to find out exactly
what was the problem, though -- I was in too much of a hurry at the
time.  Also, is there an "official" ikd patch that incorporates the
above patch?  I can't seem to get to 'e-mind.com' to check, but it's
not out on andrea's page on SuSE.
That's it for now.
