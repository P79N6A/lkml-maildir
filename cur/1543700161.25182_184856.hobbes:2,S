Hi,
I just learned that it is expected behavior for a module
to be in use while having an in-use count of zero, see
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1693.
 If this is
so, how am I supposed to know whether a module can safely
be unloaded? It also seems the old 'autoclean / modprobe -k'
functionality from 2.4 is no longer available in 2.6.
In case this has been discussed before, please accept my
apologies. I just wasn't able to locate the information, so
I am posting here. If anyone wants to respond, please CC me
on your reply, since I am not subscribed to this list.
