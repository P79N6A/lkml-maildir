That should be fine ... the application copies the sense out of
scmnd->sense_buffer ... it can take as much or as little as it wants
(sense_buffer is actually a SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE array inside the
command). There was one thing I missed, which is that the sense buffer
size of the command is 252, whereas I need to set it back down to
sizeof(scmnd->sense_buffer).
This is another area where we "could do better" ... the request actually
gives us a sense buffer, but we use our own and later copy data out of
it back into the request.
