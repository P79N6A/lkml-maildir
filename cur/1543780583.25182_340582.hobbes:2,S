I don't know if this is the same problem... Let's hope that it IS the 
same problem, because the fix that Bodo speaks of has already been 
included in 2.6.13-rc6:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=history;h=00dd1e433967872f3997a45d5adf35056fdf2f56;f=drivers/media/video/bttv-driver.c
Please test again using Kernel 2.6.13-rc6 and let us know if the problem 
persists.
