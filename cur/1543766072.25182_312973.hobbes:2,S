Someone (aka Tospin, infinicon, and Amasso) should probably post a patch
adding '#define VM_REGISTERD 0x01000000', and some extensions to
something like 'madvise' to set pages to be registered.
My preference is said patch will also allow a way for the kernel to
reclaim registered memory from an application under memory pressure.
