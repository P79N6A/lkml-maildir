Subject: [Suspend2][ 05/28] [Suspend2] Enable/disable swapfile.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/448

Routines to enable and disable a swap file specifically for suspending. The
swapon is called after userspace is frozen and the swapoff is done prior to
restarting userspace. We can't completely remove the possibility of it
being used by the vm. We're just doing the best we can.
