No, but the maximum timeslice (sole metric changed by nice) is 200, the
min is 10 (5%). And between them, timeslices are calculated linearly.

No, but it should get 2000% of what a nice +19 process will get in the
same system (regardless of what else is running).

I don't know exactly what nice is supposed to do other than "raise
priority", but its fairly well accepted that it should increase the
process' % cpu time (vs others) without completely starving everyone.
It is probably a justified criticism that 5% is too much for a +19 task
to get vs a -20 task, but it has to get something.
