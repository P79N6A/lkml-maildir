and there's an interesting note that i should add here, cause there's
a downside to using fadvise() instead of O_STREAM when the programmer
is not careful.  I spent at least a month doing some complex blktrace
analysis to try to figure out why Digeo's new platform (which used the
fadvise() call) didn't have the kind of streaming performance that it
should have.  One symptom I found was that even on the media partition
where I/O should have always been happening in nice 512K chunks
(ra_pages == 128), it seemed to be happening in random values between
32K and 512K.  It turns out that the code pulls in some size chunk,
maybe 32K, then does an fadvise DONTNEED on the fd, *with zero offset
and zero length*, meaning that it wipes out *all* the pagecache for
the file.  That means that the rest of the 512K from the readahead
would get discarded before it got used, and later the remaining pages
in the ra window would get faulted in again.
Most applications don't get the kind of performance analysis that
Digeo was doing, and even then, it's rather lucky that we caught that.
 So I personally think it'd be best for libc or something to simulate
the O_STREAM behavior if you ask for it.  That would simplify things
for the most common case, and have the side benefit of reducing the
amount of extra code an application would need in order to take
advantage of that feature.
