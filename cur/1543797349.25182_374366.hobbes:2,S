I don't think so - some platforms could discover platform devices
separately from drivers being loaded (think separate modules). Then,
like with PCI, they would have devices without drivers... My question
was more along the loines "do we want to waste some memory registering
a driver that does absolutely nothing except for signalling userspace
that drive is indeed has a driver attached". And letting userspace
know that device is handled is probably a good thing.
