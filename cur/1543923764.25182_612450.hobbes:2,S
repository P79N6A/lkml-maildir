In general it looks good ... I suppose the only way to test it is to
stick it in and see what happens.  However, there are a few rough edges.

This bit isn't quite right ... this will return true if there's a
collected sense code and false otherwise (so it returns 0 on failure
that doesn't produce any sense information).

Unit attention won't necessarily mean the media is OK ... unit attention
can mean the media or tray status has changed.

Actually, all asc 0x4 codes are some type of in progress operation,
format doesn't necessarily have to be treated specially.

This is also a bit odd.  asc 0x3a ascq 0x2 definitely means tray open,
but there are a lot of other not ready conditions that don't mean this.
