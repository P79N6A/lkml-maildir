	Yup. That's what UMSDOS tries to do. And it's broken.

	Not that simple. Linux VFS differs from 4.4BSD one - our lookup() 
method sits in inode. Good to have such beasts in vnode layer and do
everything from there, but... We'll have to do it in harder way.

	Yes. That's what I'm hacking on since September.
rmdir()/rename()/unlink()/mknod() cleanup in 131-ac* is byproduct of that
hacking - I've stumbled across the bugs that were way too serious to leave
them till 2.3 ;-/ Current showstopper being how to deal with FAT-based
filesystems. They do lots of nasty things to dentry layer (e.g. flip inode
under living dentry). It's an artefact of the old scheme (no dentries, all
lookups go through inodes), but now it can be fixed. After I'll clean that
up (and find enough people to test it - hint, hint ;-) I'm going to do
partial rewrite of fs/namei.c (lookup and namespace-changing operations)
to obtain atomic lookups (that would exterminate most of fs races). Then
the stacked filesystems will go. I know how to do it, but right now we
have a mess on the border between VFS and filesystems and hacking anything
into that mess wouldn't do any good.

	If you think of moving some operations to dentry layer - forget
it. inode_operations is used by drivers. MANY drivers. Third-party ones at
that. Moreover, we don't actually need that - there is cleaner solution.

	Nah. Not the way to go - what we need is a *stack* of dentries.
