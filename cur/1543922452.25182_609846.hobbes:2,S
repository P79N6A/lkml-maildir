OK. Let me try.

'noflush' is currently the only option for userspace to suspend without
risking otherwise-avoidable I/O lost, because failure of underlying
device might occur *after* the userspace started normal suspend
but *before* the flushing completes. (normal suspend = flushing suspend)
E.g. if userspace wants to resize dm-mpath device with queue_if_no_path,
it has to use 'noflush' suspend on table swapping.
Otherwise, path failures during the suspend will cause I/O error,
though queue_if_no_path is specified.
Other possible solution would be allowing the suspend to fail if it
can't flush all I/O and letting userspace to retry after fixing
the device failure.

If userspace cares about not losing I/O, it should wait for the I/O
before trying to shrink the device size.
After the shrinking started, any I/O beyond the new end of the device
would have a possibility of lost.
Reducing the size of the device while actively running I/O on it
would anyway have a possibility of losing some of the I/O.

Issuing the I/O beyond the end of the existing device would get error.
If the issuer knows the device will be extended, it should wait for
the completion of the extention.
If it doesn't know, such I/O won't be issued.

There is no guarantee that the I/O flowing through the device again.
The table might need be replaced again, but to do that, the resume
should have been completed to let the userspace know it.
bdget() in noflush suspend has a possibility of stall.
Once it stalls, the remedy is userspace to replace the table with
working one. However, since bdget() occurs inside of suspend_lock,
it's not possible to run other instance of suspend/resume.
OTOH, calling bdget() and i_size_write() outside of the lock
can cause race with other table swapping and may result in setting
wrong device size.
Also, bdget() allocates new bdev inode if there isn't.
But dm wants to access bdev inode only when it exists in memory.
So something like bdlookup() will fit for the purpose, IMO.
