Hello,
obviously this is the case. This morning I tried a different non-cardbus 
PCMCIA card and it worked, which in turn was the case for the other test 
candidates, NICs and CF adapters: they all are accessible right now. In 
the moment I am trying to find out which update caused the improvement.
Thank you very much for your attention and, please, excuse me for 
bothering you.
Best regards, Alexander.
