I've been twaddling with getting SpeedStep right on my laptop (HP
nc6000, 1.6GHz P-M) and noticed a few odd things:
Using regular SpeedStep is says to use speedstep-centrino due to
voltage regultion, etc.
Using SpeedStep for Centrino og gived me this line on boot:
speedstep-centrino: found "Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor 1600MHz": max frequency: 1600000kHz
This seems to work and make the battery last an useful amount of time.
Using SpeedStep for Centrino with decoding the speeds and voltages
(CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI) will not yield any output during
boot regarding cpufreq at all and the battery useage is heavy. ACPI is
enabled. 
mvh,
A
