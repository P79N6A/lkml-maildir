No, not really.  If things can be done outside of kernel, we like to 
keep them there.  e.g.  SMART is implemented in the userland and it fits 
there.  Kernel only has to provide mechanisms to enable such implementation.

Streaming / relaxed reliablity is a very specialized feature requiring 
very specialized software to drive it.  I can't think of much use in the 
generic vm/fs/block framework.  So, I don't see it happening in the kernel.

No, it's not a horrible hack.  Again, no one thinks smartd is a horrible 
hack.  Even core things like irqbalancing and CPU speeding down are 
controlled from userland.  Being in the userland is a good thing - it's 
much safer & more convenient/flexible out there.

One thing to think about before supporting streaming from/to harddisks 
from userland is how to make data flow efficiently from userland to 
kernel and back.  But, no matter what, kernel <-> userland usually 
involves one data copy, so I don't think making sg similarly efficient 
would be too difficult (it might be already).

Why direct kernel device support necessary for such things?  What kind 
of interface are you proposing?  I can't think of anything better than 
libatastreaming (or whatever, just focus on the leading 'lib'), which 
uses sg to issue commands and manage everything.
