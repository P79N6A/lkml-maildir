correction to my ealier message - your patch is absolutely fine (assuming 
you meant brackets like these:

The "other mmap-related problems" I mentioned are in 2.3.24 also (I 
checked 2.3.18 and *assumed* "probably works in 2.3.24 - a few kernel 
versions... what is that betwixt me and thee" :)).
So, this "other" problem is that malloc(0x3000) results in a system call 
brk(0x4000) whilst I expect to see something like brk(0x804cdef). So it 
fails with ENOMEM. I will have to look at 2.3.18->2.3.24 and see whether 
brk(2) semantics has changed (it always had a *endds argument so I 
assumed it is still teh case).

Tigran.
