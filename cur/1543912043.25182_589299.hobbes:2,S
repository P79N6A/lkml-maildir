I apologize for not recognizing your approach from our earlier discussion on 
the LSM mailing list in July.  Unfortunately, I have the same objections to 
these changes that I did back then and from what I can recall of the 
discussion the rest of the kernel networking community agreed that these 
changes are not the preferred way of solving this problem.  We offered 
suggestions on how to accomplish your goals in a way that would be acceptable 
upstream and I would encourage you to investigate those options further.
