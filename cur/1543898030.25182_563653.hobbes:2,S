This is what my / Frank's patch was aimed at: give the user the ability to
(painlessly, without rebuilding the kernel) debug suspend problems. Keep the
default safe, like Linus likes it (consoles suspended), but give the user a
switch to make it unsafe (consoles not suspended) for the sake of debugging.
Of course, fixing up all console drivers is an option that i'd very much like
to see. It is however debatable if it is really worth the effort. If it works
with consoles suspended, the user does not care. If it doesn't, he turns on
debugging (knowing, or being told that this will break using netconsole).
I strongly oppose Pavel's approach to "declare all console drivers as
nonbroken except netconsole". Even if he has not seen any failures apart
from netconsole, in general i had the impression that suspending consoles
did help. At least suspend works on many more machines than half a year ago,
and i'd not be surprised if this was partly due to suspending the consoles.
Remember that wrt. suspend "i did not get a bugreport" very often just means
"people tried it, it did not work, but they expected that and just turned
 away". It does not mean "it just works for everyone".
