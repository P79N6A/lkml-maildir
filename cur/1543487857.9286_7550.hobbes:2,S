I'd check again using strace or such.  It definitely doesn't work here over
NFS, just locally.  We tested programs (written in C) in a mixed environment
of Solaris and DU boxes.  fcntl() locks were recognized by other machines,
flock() locks were not.  There was, however, a newsgroup posting by a DEC
employee some months back stating that they may extend flock() to work over
NFS in 4.0E.  I haven't verified if they did or not.  I hope not.
