Subject: [PATCH] Change x86 Machine check handler to use unlocked_iocl instead of ioctl
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/9/8

The Machine check handler registers ioctl handler that is called
with the BKL held. Changing to register unlocked_ioctl instead.
Also mce ioctl handler does not seem to need any lock protection.

Change the Machine check handler to use unlocked_ioctl instead of
