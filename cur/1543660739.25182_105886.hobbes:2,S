I guess not :
Recently I moved one drive from one old system to a new one. The new BIOS
couldn't be configured to use the old geometry -> I couldn't use the drive
to boot (unless repartitioning the 120GiB beast).
During the migration process I tried different geometry settings and at
several times the cylinder number was way above the drive's actual limit.
I could hear loud "bumps" when the drive accessed the higher cylinders.
Each time I rushed to the reset button...
This was with a SiS735 chipset and a Maxtor 4G120J6.
