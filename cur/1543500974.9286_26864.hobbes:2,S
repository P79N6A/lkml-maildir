I have to admit thaat I was under the saame misunderstanding

Perhaps I can suggest the enclosed patch - if you like it, you can
forward it to Linus...
Best wishes from Riley.

 Emulate Sun NFS daemon
 CONFIG_NFSD_SUN
-  If you would like for the server to allow clients to access
-  directories that are mount points on the local filesystem (this is
-  how nfsd behaves on Sun systems), say yes here. If unsure, say N.
+  If you say Y here, then when this system is used as an NFS server,
+  the behaviour of nfsd on Sun systems will be emulated. If you say
+  N here, then a cleaner (and potentially more secure) behavioural
+  style will be used. If unsure, say N.
+
+  To clarify the behaviour of Sun systems in this respect, imagine a
+  system where the /home/ftp partition has a subdirectory pub with a
+  file in it called pub/.message and where a second partition has
+  been munted over /home/ftp/pub and has thus hidden the pub/.message
+  file.
+
+  With the Sun systems behaviour, that hidden pub/.message file will
+  be visible to NFS clients that mount the /home/ftp partition from
+  your server, UNLESS they also mount the /home/ftp/pub partition on
+  top of it.
