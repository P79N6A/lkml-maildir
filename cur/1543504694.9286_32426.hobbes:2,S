wouldnt it be better to explicitly list initialization dependencies in
some way? Thats a whole lot more generic and flexible than static
'priorities'. (eg. just because you introduce a new intermediate
dependency you'd have to shift down all sub-modules.) The boot code then
would resolve these dependencies. (and detect things like circular
dependencies as well)
