So you have two programs running, one at priority 10 and 30 right?

So, are these programs still running?  Are they in busy loops?

How did the filesystems go into read-only?  Did the tests do that?

I'll need more info to understand these.

Don't know yet.

Nope, you can use any rt priority you want.  It's up to you whether you
want to preempt the softirqs or not. Be careful, timers may be preempted
from delivering signals to high priority processes.  I have a patch to
fix this, but I'm waiting on input from either Thomas Gleixner or Ingo.

No need.
