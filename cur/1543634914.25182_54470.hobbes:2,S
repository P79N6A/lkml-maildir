Identifying the valid execution address in a stack traceback isn't
possible on many architectures (in particular, i386 without debugging
support enabled) so this wouldn't work if one of the functions had
called into a function outside the module.
On the other hand, if it was made a rule that any code in a module that
might theoretically be running without reference counts wasn't allowed
to call out of the module (or maybe was allowed to call out to a very
specific small set of library functions that were known to the module
system), then something like this might work.
