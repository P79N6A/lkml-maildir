We've already determined that /dev/sda is the partition table and should 
thus fail.

Hmm so it passes.
Could you try passing -v (for verbose) to the fsck...
Also perhaps just do
  cat /dev/sda1 > /tmp/file
  dosfsck -v /tmp/file
  mount -o loop /tmp/file /mnt/somewhere
and see if that fails, if so the bug is pure vfat
then try bzipping the /tmp/file and posting it somewhere and pass the link 
and I'll take a look...

FAT32 is one possibility of VFAT - VFAT is any FAT(12,16,32) with long 
filenames.
