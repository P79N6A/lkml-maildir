Good question.
It should be safe because of the magic return value from "writepage()".
If "writepage()" returns 1, then that implies that the page is locked down
somehow. But you're right, this is ugly, if not outright buggy (maybe the
locked down state could change after the writepage, who knows?).
Moving the test is probably a good idea.
