i've been meaning to ask this since i saw the thread on pgcc
optimization options...
arch/i386/Makefile sets these options for most variants of x86:
	-malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -malign-loops=2
1.  "2" is the compiler's default for all of these options.
    why are these specified at all?
2.  why are these separately specifiable?  under what circumstances
    would you want to set all three differently?
i've been wondering what is the appropriate value for these, based
on populating the CPU cache most efficiently.  i dimly recalled
that the Pentium family had a 32-byte cache line, so i hopefully set
these values to 5 (2 to the 5th is 32 bytes).  performance dipped
(measured experientially and with lmbench).
i set the values to 4 and recompiled again.  performance seems
about the same as before, although i haven't run lmbench again
to confirm the difference.
btw andrea -- where did you find the cache specs ??
