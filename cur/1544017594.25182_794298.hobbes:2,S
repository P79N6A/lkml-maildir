To be fair to SLUB, we do have the pending slab defragmentation
patches in my tree. Not that we have any numbers on if defragmentation
helps and how much. IIRC, Christoph said one of the reasons for
avoiding queues in SLUB is to be able to do defragmentation. But I
suppose with SLQB we can do the same thing as long as we flush the
queues before attempting to defrag.
