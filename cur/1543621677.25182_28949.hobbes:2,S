I wouldn't read too much into the variance, swapping is fairly brain-damaged at
the moment.  Please stand by for an update after we kick around the question of
how to repair the swap locking and we'll get better numbers.  They are going to
be in the same ballpark, hopefully with less variance.  Thanks a lot for the
graph.
