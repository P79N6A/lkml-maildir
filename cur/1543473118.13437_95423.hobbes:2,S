Hi there.
Does anybody know whether SyQuest's SyJet 1.5G Parallel Port Removable
Hard Drive works with Linux, and if so, what options I would need to
use with it?
I'm thinking of getting one of these beasties, and would prefer to
have it work under Linux rather than LoseSleep, hence the question.
From the box, I note under "Technical Data" that it lists various
flavours of Windows operating systems it will work under, then
comments that it...
 Q> Will perform as EIDE compliant under UNIX or Novell Netware.
It also notes on the box that a "SyQuest Provided Parallel Port to
SCSI Adapter" is included, if that helps...
Best wishes from Riley.
