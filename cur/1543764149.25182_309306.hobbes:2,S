Yeah, I know. *sigh*

I'm not seeing a printk storm, at least, none that I can discern...

I'm working on it right now.
2.6.11 + linus.patch from 2.6.11-mm3 works.
2.6.11 + approx. 292 patches from 2.6.11-mm3 is broken.
2.6.11 + approx. 130 patches (a proper subset of the 292 patches) works.
(this is counting each subsystem bk tree as a single patch)
The diff between the latter two trees is still larger than the
2.6.11-bk9 -> -bk10 diff, but after one or two more iterations of
(psuedo-)binary search, it should be much smaller.
I'm planning to go as far as I can before going to bed tonight.
