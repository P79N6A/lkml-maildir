You may have DMA turned on, but it may be ineffectual if you don't
have the right IDE driver handing your disk.

What does hdparm -tT /dev/hda say? If the numbers are reasonable
(~400MB/s for cache reads, ~25MB/s for buffered disk reads), then
you're just doing a lot of seeking on the drive, and that takes a long
time. (Drives can seek about 100 times a second. If every seek reads
only 4k of data, that's 400k of data processed per second, or a lot of
time spent with the CPU waiting on I/O.)
