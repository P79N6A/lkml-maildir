Does the same on my system here.. I stumbled on it by accident after
doing an ldconfig -v after replacing a library without rebuilding it..
shocked me really cause I didnt know what happened..
Instantly rebooted.. No warning..
Nasty really cause none of the disks were cleanly unmounted.. machine came
back up fine tho..
running redhat 5.2 here.. Pentium 166 - Non MMX.. on kernel 2.2.0
Regards, Jim.
