Okay, now I have to start talking about implementation. Assume ext2 as
a base. Theres new object "cowid" which contains, well, id for
get_data_id() and usage count. Each inode either has pointer to
"cowid" object, or it is plain old regular file.
INODE123 Usage count = 2.
> What happens, if you copyfile() a file that has two links?
copyfile results in:
INODE123 Usage count = 2, pointer to cowid 567
COWID 567: Usage count = 2
INODE124 Usage count = 1, pointer to cowid 567
> Then you link() the result.
No, problem just increase usage count on inode124:
INODE123 Usage count = 2, pointer to cowid 567
COWID 567: Usage count = 2
INODE124 Usage count = 2, pointer to cowid 567
> Then you copyfile() one of those two links.
Creates another inode pointing at same old cowid:
INODE123 Usage count = 2, pointer to cowid 567
COWID 567: Usage count = 3
INODE124 Usage count = 2, pointer to cowid 567
INODE125 Usage count = 1, pointer to cowid 567
> Then you link()...
INODE123 Usage count = 2, pointer to cowid 567
COWID 567: Usage count = 3
INODE124 Usage count = 2, pointer to cowid 567
INODE125 Usage count = 2, pointer to cowid 567
Now, if I write to any inode with has cowid, data have to be copied,
and pointer to cowid deleted from that inode .
