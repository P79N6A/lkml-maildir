This is pointless, as %eax will be clobbered by the callee of the
subsequent call.
>+	push %edx

>+	CFI_REL_OFFSET edx,0
This likewise is pointless, as the argument is owned by the callee.

And this too - the value now in %eax has no relation with the
value known by the caller of this routine (which doesn't expect
any return from here anyway).
