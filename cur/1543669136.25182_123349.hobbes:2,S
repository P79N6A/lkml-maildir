It is a good idea to do so (although its a matter of taste too). It
doesn't need a foot long pile of blurb. Its quite sufficient to say
Copyright (C) <year> <author) and state where the GPL is found.
Some people advise that the no warranty piece by present in each file
and you'll see IBM I think do that.
