No, you are. Keith is asking module owners to change their part of the  
*implementation*, not any *intent*. He says that if a BSD/noadv module  
source is in the kernel, the correct tag is GPL/BSD, not BSD/noadv.

Sure. What it needs to be, when included with the kernel and distributed  
(and the inclusion and distribution are the critical points here, not OSS- 
freeness) is GPL-compatible; that means that the combination *will* be  
GPL. That is the famous "viral clause" in the GPL.
That doesn't mean that non-GPL-compatible stuff isn't OSS, just that it  
cannot be distributed with the kernel, because the kernel *is* GPL. It's a  
consequence of the GPL, not of the OSS rules.

Aah, so it seems *you* are on a witch hunt against the GPL!
I have no idea why someone using the BSD license - which, after all,  
allows for relicensing under any proprietary scheme you care to dream up -  
should have any problem whatsoever with relicensing under the GPL. Nor do  
I have any idea why someone using the GPL should have any problem with  
anything else also available under the GPL.
There's no conflict here. We're not talking about who is more free.
