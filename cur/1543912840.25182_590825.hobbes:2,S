that is *so* not my call.  i just thought that, if you were about to
embark on this clean-up, you knew what was ahead of you.  if you're
still interested in doing it, my best advice is to do it a subsystem
at a time, and submit the patches just to those subsystems or the
appropriate maintainers, rather than to the whole LKML, in order to
keep the traffic down.
and i'd encourage you to keep working on this.  and if you have any
more general questions, you're better off asking on the kernel
janitors list, not LKML.
