They don't exist in the kernel right now, that's why you haven't found
any examples.
To support SDIO, the MMC layer would need to be extended to handle the
initialisation of SDIO cards (they're a bit different from SD storage
and MMC). After that, a driver model needs to be constructed. It might
be possible to build upon the current MMC driver model, but one would
need to make sure that cards that are both storage and SDIO are handled.

It's a subset of the SD standard suite. Note that it only specifies how
to get access to registers in the card (like for instance PCI). To
actually use the card you also need a specification for how to use the
registers.

Depends on if there is a generic interface for SDIO WLAN cards. SD is a
very closed world so we know very little about the protocols.

Depends on context. It might refer to the driver for SD storage cards.
Or it might refer to a driver for the SD controller (that interfaces to
the card(s)).

If we're talking about SD storage vs SDIO, then the drivers use
different parts of the SD protocol. They share the same bus interface
though (which is implemented as the MMC layer in Linux).

There are a lot of people interested, but I haven't seen anyone working
on it yet.
