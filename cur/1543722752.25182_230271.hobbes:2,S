I haven't seen what is in -bk7 so I don't know if there's an issue with
applying it to that. Anything's possible, though. See if you can
reproduce it and isolate it to staircase or not and collect some more
info about what is happening with the task from top, vmstat and
/proc/$pid/status
Cheers,
Con
