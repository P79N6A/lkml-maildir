If. They. Are. Splitted. Into major and minor. Which IMO is better to
avoid if possible. Besides, users also see 33,  76 along with /dev/hdf12.
Now, the kdevname() in mounting root is worth replacing with check for
device existence + more detailed flame (either "you asked root on 8:12 and
I don't know a device with such major:minor; recompile the kernel or FOAD"
or "no valid filesystem on /dev/sdb2").
