You must be kidding, aren't you ? I would better say that the very high
number of reports on lkml about 2.6 seems to confirm that 2.6 still is
a toy !
Marcelo has done a great job at getting 2.4 stable, and now people are
installing it in remote locations or embedded system with no planned
updated at all. And it works. Just like people did with 2.0 recently.
This may be why there are so few reports.
