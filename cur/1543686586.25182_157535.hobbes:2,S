Hi all,
I don't know if this is the right place to ask this question but I tried
Google and irc and couldn't ind an answer. I have an old Thinkpad 760EL
and a 8139 based d-link 690txd ethernet card which just wont work properly
under 2.4.18.
The card gets recognized, however in the process the following is printed
out:
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:02.0
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin B of device 00:02.1
Yenta IRQ list 06b8, PCI irq0
Socket status: 30000020
Yenta IRQ list 06b8, PCI irq0
Socket status: 30000006
cs: cb_alloc(bus 1): vendor 0x1186, device 0x1340
PCI: Enabling device 01:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 01:00.0

8139too Fast Ethernet driver 0.9.25
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A device 01:00.0
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 01:00.0 to 64
divert: allocating divert_blk for eth0
eth0: D-Link DFE-690TXD (RealTek RTL8139) at 0xc5073000,
00:40:05:0b:8a:66, IRQ 0
eth0: Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8139C'
All looks more or less fine and dandy, however there is no network
connectivity. If I do ifdown eth0 and then ifup eth0, I get:
SIOCSIFFLAGS: Device of resource busy
After a slight wait, ifup returns with the message "failed" (I am using
dhcp).
Any ideas?
Thanks (and please don't kill me for posting to this mailing list, I know
it is for discussion of kernel development issues).
