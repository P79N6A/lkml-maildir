Not true.  I sent my response to the bug to linux-scsi and cc'd bugzilla.
Unfortunately, the bug reporter sent the information requested to bugzilla
instead of linux-scsi.  So it got lost and overlooked.
If there's willingness to change, I'm willing to put some effort into
moving us to a bug tracking system that fits our workflow better than
bugzilla.  But if that effort will be disregarded, then let me know now
so I don't waste my time.
