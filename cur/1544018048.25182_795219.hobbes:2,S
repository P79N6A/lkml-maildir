In a case like that, a user would have to do their own signal sending
rather than letting the "signal" subsystem handle it. The signal
subsystem is more useful for doing things like sending less-refined
signals like SIGSTOP or SIGKILL to all tasks in a cgroup.

Yes.

Supporting mounting a subsystem in multiple different hierarchies
would pretty much involve supporting mounting a hierarchy with no
subsystems (at least in the way I envisaged it), so you wouldn't need
any subsystem in that case if you were just trying to do grouping.
