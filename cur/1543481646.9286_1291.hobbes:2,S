I'm not an experienced kernel hacker, nor am I subscribed to this list,
but I think my findings might be of some importance....
While trying to compile and install lm_sensors-2.1.2 (hardware
temperature, etc. monitoring), I ran into a compile error in one of the
kernel header files.  Here is gcc's output:
*** begin gcc output ***
gcc -I. -Ii2c -O2 -DLM_SENSORS -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wshadow
-Wpointer-arith -Wcast-qual -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings
-Wnested-externs
-Winline -DI2C -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -fomit-frame-pointer -D__SMP__ -c
src/smbus.c -o src/smbus.o
/usr/include/asm/semaphore.h: In function `waking_non_zero':
In file included from i2c/i2c.h:33,
                 from src/i2c.h:26,
                 from src/smbus.c:25:
/usr/include/asm/semaphore.h:141: `PAGE_MASK' undeclared (first use this
function)
/usr/include/asm/semaphore.h:141: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
/usr/include/asm/semaphore.h:141: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [src/smbus.o] Error 1
*** end gcc output ***
it is generating an error, because the function waking_non_zero
references a macro defined earlier in the file, which references a
constant (PAGE_MASK) which is not defined.
after a bit of grepping, I found that this constant is defined in
<asm/page.h>
after much finding and grepping and whatnot, I concluded that none of
the files that semaphore.h includes include <asm/page.h>.  By inserting
a #include <asm/page.h> at line 25 in semaphore.h (just after all the
other includes), the compile error was resolved, and the program built
without errors.
another item of some interest to note:
the comments at the beginning of semaphore.h look to be identical in the
2.0.36 kernel tree and in the 2.2.0-pre9 tree, including the "modified"
date (a date in 1996).  However, the rest of the files seem to be
COMPLETELY different, not even declaring the same functions.
Like I said, I'm not an experienced kernel hacker, so I will leave the
analysis of what really should be done with this (perhaps some other
file is supposed to include page.h?) to those that are experienced.
Again, I'm not subscribed to the list, so if you have any questions,
