I'm not good with names :-)
Note that there also might be cases where using such a memcpy
variant might be the wrong thing to do.  For example, for a very
tightly coupled CMT cpu implementation which has the memory controller,
L2 cache, PCI controller, etc. all on the same die and the PCI controller
makes use of the L2 cache just like the cpu threads do, using this
kind of memcpy would always be the wrong thing to do.
