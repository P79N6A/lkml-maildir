A minor PCI terminology point: PCI buses are subdivided into devices, not (necessarily) slots. So, for example, a multiple-device PCI card (say, two SCSI controllers) might have a PCI bridge creating a new bus, and two devices (not slots) on that bus. (It could alternatively be implemented as a single device with two functions,  given a dual-interface chip, but not necessarily.)
So a better name would be /dev/bus/pci0/dev1/fcn0/bus0/tgt1/lun2/part3 (taking the liberty of abbreviating some of the other names).
How, if at all, would RAID devices, using more than one physical device, or SCSI bus, or PCI card, fit into this naming scheme?
