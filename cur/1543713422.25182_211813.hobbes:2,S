In my previous reply to Rusty, I wrote:

Brain dead code alert (as well as a typo alert for the 'cpumap') - that
last line needs to be:
	    bitmap_or(s.bits, d1.bits, d2.bits, NR_CPUS);
Which is why the 60 odd cpumask and nodemask specific operation macros
exist, to avoid having to explicitly specify the bitsize on each call
In other words, I understand that the following three possibilities
exist for coding these masks:
    /* specify bitsize both on declarations and operations */
    struct cpumask { DECLARE_BITMAP(bits, NR_CPUS); };
    struct cpumask s, d1, d2;
    bitmap_or(s.bits, d1.bits, d2.bits, NR_CPUS);	/* explicit bitsize */
or:
    /* specify bitsize on declaration; use specialized operations */
    struct cpumask { DECLARE_BITMAP(bits, NR_CPUS); };
    struct cpumask s, d1, d2;
    cpus_or(s.bits, d1.bits, d2.bits);			/* 'cpu' implies NR_CPUS */
or:
    /* carry the bitsize in the structure [pseudo C alert] */
    struct mask { int nbits = NR_CPUS; DECLARE_BITMAP(bits, NR_CPUS); };
    struct mask s, d1, d2;
    mask_or(s.bits, d1.bits, d2.bits);			/* mask_* ops get size from struct */
Am I missing any choices?  Which do you prefer?
I understand that the kernel currently does the 2nd choice, encoding the
bitsize in the operation name.
My personal preference is to continue doing this 2nd choice.
