Don't know if this has already been reported, but:
  when the code starts at bootup, screen goes wild with colored lines
  like in a bad TV transmission. Letting the boot sequence end and
  starting X afterwards yields no significant improvement - screen
  is slightly less wild but entirely unusable.
2.4.22-pre4 works fine.
base of RedHat 8.0 on a Dell Latitude C640, with this from lspci:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M7 LW [Radeon Mobility 7500]
