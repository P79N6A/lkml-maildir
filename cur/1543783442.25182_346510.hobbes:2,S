You're presenting PowerOP as a multi-platform thing in its own right.
I think that's my missing "higher level framework".  Although given the
other two patches in this group, maybe it was the sysfs API?  :)

Something like -- certainly.  I suspect what I'm thinking about as the
API-visible structure is what you might want to call a range of operating
points, not just a single one ... example, "any CPU rate, low voltage, with
audio and display off".
In that example, suppose there are five choices for the CPU clock setting.
One way defines a different point for each choice, leading to five times
as many states as the one that just says "doesn't matter".
Come to think of it, I'm not clear how you think device drivers (a common
generic structure!) would interact with changes to power constraints.
Would you see the display driver being responsible for turning its power on
and off?  Or would code that switches operating points handle that too?
Should drivers get "here's the next operating point" calls?

Surely at least drawing a line between the on-chip hardware and
the drivers for external stuff is simple enough, though.  This
current construction would make it hard to draw that line, since
there's no distinction between the SOC logic (potentially very
reusable) and the board specific details (often less so) including
discrete devices and their drivers.

I'm not sure why you say either of those things.  Surely the point
of the "echo pointname >file" operation is to change several
power constraints at once?  And I don't think you've talked much
about the layers on either side of PowerOP ... except maybe to say
they should exist.  :)

So you see why I want the "thing" seen by userspace to cover a range
of power states:  otherwise those "very frequent" adjustments would
always involve userspace transition and scheduling delays.

Much less "usermode" ones.  ;)
There will certainly be globs of functionality on a given platform
that don't factor nicely, and demand more monolithic approaches.
Groups of interrelated clocks seem to give good examples.
Then there will be other globs that _do_ factor more politely.
