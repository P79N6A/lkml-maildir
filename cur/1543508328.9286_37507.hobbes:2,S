Is this documented somewhere?
Perhaps in the absence of the new config option mentioned above, it should
be automatically enabled if the backing store is a file rather than a block
device (we already know about this inside the loop driver, don't we?). Though
something should winge (the driver to syslog, or losetup to tty) in this case.
And the option should be settable to 'no' to override the default.
