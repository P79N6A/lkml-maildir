Hello,
I have some binaries built on a RHEL 3/EM64T platform. Can I directly port them to an RHEL 3/AMD64 platform and run without any issue? 
I know that EM64T and AMD64 are ISA compatible, but there could be some differences in ELF32 between these 2 processor architectures. 
Any input will be appreciated. 
Thanks
Rajib
