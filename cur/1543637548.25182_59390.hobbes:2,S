Yes, provided that module and kernel have the same version string 
("2.4.18-preX").

No. If you enable modversions, that will always cause stricter checking - 
without modversions, basically only the comparison of the version string 
protects you from inserting an incompatible module. If you have 
modversions enabled, the generated checksums provide additional checking 
for mismatching ABIs (interfaces).

The build process in 2.4 will generate a modversions.h file no matter what 
CONFIG_MODVERSION says (but it'll be empty if it's switched off). For some 
insight in what magic happens I put a lengthy comment into the 2.5 version 
of include/linux/module.h - "So how does the CONFIG_MODVERSIONS magic 
work?", if you're interested you may want to check that out.
