I'm interested in finding what magic is required to get a stable
setup with qlogic drivers and LVM. I have tested many kernel combinations,
vendor kernels, stock, -aa and variety of different qlogic drivers
inclusing the one with the alleged stack hog fixes and they all ooops
when using LVM (can take up to 10 days of production load). Removing
LVM 45 days ago and now I have 45 days uptime on these boxes.
I'm currently building a test setup to try and excercise this problem
as all my other boxes with qlogic cards are production and can't be
played with. I really miss having volume management and a SAN setup
is really where you need it the most.
