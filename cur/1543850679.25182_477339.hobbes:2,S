Ok, we have one bug and one mistake on your part:
1) we should include <stddef.h> instead of <linux/stddef.h> in files using 
host headers (I don't have the error message at hand, so please handle this 
yourself, Jeff)
2) /usr/include/{linux,asm} being symlinks inside /usr/src/linux/include is an 
unsupported configuration since ages. #1 is still a valid bug because when a 
distribution will distribute glibc and kernheaders based on 2.6.18.1+/2.6.19 
ones we'll break anyway.

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
