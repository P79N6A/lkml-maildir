Realistic app which is something users really run?
Also do the other constraints above apply?
If you use pci_alloc_coherent() then it will already take care of the rules
above btw (e.g. DTRT when the machine has <3GB etc.)

You should be probably using pci_alloc_coherent() at least on x86.
It might get more expensive on some obscure platforms (which DRM
likely doesn't support anyways), but if it does perhaps a pci_alloc_noncoherent()
or so would be useful (on x86 it would be the same)
