It can even take forever when people piss me off.
This patch set affects 5 different subsystems and several
dozen drivers. All these drivers have been (ab)using the previous
and current I2C device naming and device/driver matching logic in

changing this now to break it again next month when other kernel
developers will complain that the new model doesn't work for them.
