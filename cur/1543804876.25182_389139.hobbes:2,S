This is the group descriptor per-group blocks and inode free counts.  The
current mke2fs code limits the number of blocks and inodes per group to
EXT2_MAX_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP (2^16 - 8) and (2^16 - EXT2_INODES_PER_BLOCK)
so that this won't overflow.  We still get linear growth of filesystem
limits with blocksize, but not cubic growth that would otherwise be there.
Bull has a patch which enlarges the group descriptor fields to allow
more blocks and inodes per group.

Hmm, I'll have to take a look at that when I get a chance.
