One of the crashed was caused by out of memory, but all the memory was 
allocated through slab.  More specifically to ip_dst_cache.

No, running OSPF with around 760 subnets.

Yes, very large number of flows.

On this machine, rigth now, between 14000 to 60000 entries in the route 
cache.  On other machines, rigth now, I have a max of 151560 entries.

On this machine 1Gb memory (and 4 others), most of the machines have 2Gb.

There is definitly high memory pressure on this machine!
Slab memory usage, range from 39Mb to 205Mb (at the moment on the production servers).
