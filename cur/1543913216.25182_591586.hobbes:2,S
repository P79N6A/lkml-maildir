Hi Jarek - thanks for the comments.
I don't see much, if any, runtime impact to having it on all the time,
except maybe the end-of-stack zeroing, which would have at least some
impact.  Everything except that single " = 0;" only runs if you've
already oopsed...  I'd hate to clutter it with #ifdefs unless there's a
good reason.

You mean, don't print unless the free value is in some range?  My
thought was, if you always print *something*, then you know for sure
you're looking at an oops from a kernel with this code in place.
Though, if "all's well" I suppose the bytes remaining isn't so
important; it would really be enough to just say:
	if (!(*stackend))
		printk("Thread stayed within stack space\n");
	else
		printk("Thread overran stack\n");

I thought about that, though really *anything* could legitimately be on
the stack, so I guess it's a question of probabilities.  And, "0" is
compatible with CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE, which sets the the whole stack
to 0 and uses that to detect max stack excursion...  I guess that option
could probably be tweaked to zero the whole stack, and then also set the
last position to something magic (0xDEAD57AC - deadstack?), and check
for that as well.  (I had thought about making helper functions for
DEBUG_STACK_OVERFLOW, right now the checks are open coded in a few places).
Thanks,
