Yup, the online/offline part works and it helped me to decode the other
reason (/me needs a dark brown paperbag) why Pavel noticed that his box
turned into a brick. I'll send out a full series of fixups (including
your online/offline one) tomorrow morning. I want to give that some more
testing.
Vs. the resume reevaluation: I don't think it's an urgent problem. It's
only my VAIO which does not tell the kernel after resume that the power
supply source has changed. All my other boxen do that and we never had a
complaint about that from other folks.
