I try to thread ipc/msg.c. My new design is nearly finished, but I have
one problem:
In a certain case, I want to rely on memory ordering instead of a
spinlock:
struct test {
	atomic_t a;
	atomic_t b;
}
CPU1:
atomic_set(a,return_value);
atomic_set(b,1234);
CPU2:
	if(atomic_read(b) == 1234)
		return atomic_read(a);
IIRC, the x86 CPU can reorder read ahead of write, and atomic_read(),
atomic_set() are normal read/write operations, so is this code SMP safe?
Which memory barrier calls are required for portability?
