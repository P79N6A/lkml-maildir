The same reason that (for instance) lp depends on parport, not parport_pc.
There are lots of chips out there, and EPAT is only one of them.  pd only
needs PARIDE, and PARIDE needs a driver like epat.o.

Use a post-install rule for paride in modules.conf (conf.modules):
post-install <module name> <action>
For instance,
post-install paride modprobe epat
