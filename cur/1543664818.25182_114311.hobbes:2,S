I have tried both your method and also booting Linux without any
interfaces enabled, then enable eth0 and after that also lo.
When only eth0 was enabled, I got the following error from sdr:
 pangsit:~> sdr
 setsockopt - IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP: No such device
 setsockopt - IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP: No such device
 sd_listen: setsockopt IP_ADD_MEMBRSHIP err, addr: 224.2.127.254
I can send strace if this helps.
This is the same problem I see with other multicast applications. It
really doesn't want to bind to the ethernet interface.
  pangsit:~> ifconfig eth0

After bringing up the loopback interface again the applications binds to
this interface.
