you missed the point that the original open() call is on /dev/fd/N,
not /proc/PID/fd/N; /proc/PID/fd/N only comes into play because the
linux implementation foists it on the user

no, in the notation above N is the fd number "so you could simply call dup(N)"
here is one reason why /dev/fd/N is useful:
/dev/fd/N is the underlying mechanism for implementing the bash and ksh
	cmd-1 <(cmd-2 ...) ... <(cmd-n ...)
each <(cmd-i ...) is converted to a pipe() with the write side getting the
output of cmd-i (and marked close on exec) and the read side *not* marked
close on exec; cmd-1 is then executed as
	cmd-1 /dev/fd/PIPE-READ-2 ... /dev/fd/PIPE-READ-n
where PIPE-READ-i is the fd number of the read side of the pipe for cmd-i
