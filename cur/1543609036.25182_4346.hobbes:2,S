I had a similar Problem while running sql-bench on Mysql ( must be mysql :-) ).
First I thought it happened since the Mysql-Tables were on the root-fs and
the Disk did not manage to retrieve normal libs and files for login usw.
But the System (2.4.14-pre8) took about 25 seconds to give a screen after
wakening from  apm (triggered by xscreensaver under gnome).
Console-Switching took even longer. Mouse-Movement stopped etc.
Disk-Activity was very high.
I had seen smaller Problems with huge loads on the root-fs earlier. But
never had a Problem with switching consoles or mouse.
