Dear devs,
In a moment of serendipity I thought of a concept which may be advantageous
if incorporated into the kernel. I was going to offer it to the OIN but
they responded they only consider existing patents and I don't have the
money to afford one.
I am seeking advice on how to proceed. It could be used as a defensive
patent in which case I can email an expert who can file it. If that is the
concept is sound. I am not expecting any royalties from this myself. The
alternative is to dump it here to the LKML.
It should be said I'm not a kernel coder and if I attempted this I would
probably do it wrong. The concept is a different way to attain performance.
The area pertaining is filesystems.
Not wishing to overstate things lest the flames scorching a bad idea get
too hot.
Regards,
Graeme
