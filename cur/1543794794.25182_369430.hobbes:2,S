Surley you would just use a single bit in the first page of a MAX_ORDER
block.   We guarentee that the mem_map is contigious out to MAX_ORDER
pages so you can simply calculate the offset.  The page free path does
the same thing to find the buddy pages when coallescing.

All of that said, I am not even sure we have a bit left in the page
