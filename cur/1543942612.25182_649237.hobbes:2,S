Yes, I know all about Jungo, and have never heard anything good about
them from either the Windows developers I know, or anyone who has tried
to get their stuff working on Linux using their framework.
I would not recommend their stuff at all, it's much easier to just write
a native Linux and Windows driver instead.  Especially with the new
Windows Driver Framework, which helps those developers out a lot more
these days.
