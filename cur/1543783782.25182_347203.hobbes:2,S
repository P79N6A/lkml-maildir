Hi Andrew,
here's another DVB update, mostly small fixes and improvements.
Patches have been prepared against 2.6.13-git4 and IMHO could
go straight into Linus' tree, but have been tested to apply
cleanly against 2.6.13-mm1.
The dvb-bt8xx-dst-doc-update.patch depends on
dvb-clarify-description-text-for-dvb-bt8xx-in-kconfig-fix.patch
which is currently in -mm1.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Johannes
