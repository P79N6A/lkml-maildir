My main point is not the number of bugs, but the number of regressions.
If you do install a new machine or do a major upgrade (e.g. 2.4 -> 2.6) 
you do some testing whether everything works as expected and if 
something doesn't work, you try to get it working or work around the 
problem.
Inside a stable kernel series (e.g. 2.6.x -> 2.6.y) you hope that an 
upgrade doesn't contain regressions and goes smoothly.
Even the introduction of CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB in 2.6.9 [1] has bitten 
several people I know.

[1] this is not technically a bug, but e.g. similar common problems
    for users in the input code were already fixed during 2.5 long
    before 2.6.0
