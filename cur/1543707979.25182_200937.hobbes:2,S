Remounting device 03:0a ... R/O
Done.
03:06, 03:08, and 03:09 are ext3.
03:05 is FAT32.
I don't know what 03:0a is (root device ?).
From the documentation:
'u'     - Will attempt to remount all mounted filesystems read-only.
But why didn't it do it for the FAT32 partition ?
# mount -o remount,ro /mnt/vfat
...
/dev/hda5 on /mnt/vfat type vfat (ro)
So, it works fine manually.
This is on 2.4.25.
