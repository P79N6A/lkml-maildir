Nothing at all.
Just post the raw Oops message as-is (from console or dmesg).

At least since 2003 and the 2.5 kernel series.
The oldest reference I could find in the archives is an email by Dave
Jones dating back to Mon Apr 14 2003 - 14:31:44 EST
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0304.1/1533.html
The interresting part of that mail is this bit
"Merging of kksymoops means that the kernel will now spit out
 automatically decoded oopses (no more feeding them to ksymoops).
 For this reason, you should always enable the option in the
 kernel hacking menu labelled "Load all symbols for debugging/kksymoops".
"

They should have.
Please read a recent Documentation/oops-tracing.txt (here's a link:
http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt?v=2.6.14-rc2
)
See the note at the top :
"NOTE: ksymoops is useless on 2.6.  Please use the Oops in its original format
 (from dmesg, etc).  Ignore any references in this or other docs to "decoding
 the Oops" or "running it through ksymoops".  If you post an Oops fron 2.6 that
 has been run through ksymoops, people will just tell you to repost it.
