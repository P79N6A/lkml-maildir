That's different.
It tends to be the case that when the dirty-data-generator hits
a particular threshold, it blocks while we write out vast amounts
of data.  So the throughput is very lumpy.
It's probable that it can be tamed a bit by fiddling with the
/proc/sys/vm/bdflush parameters.

The -aa patches fiddle extensively with the bdflush thresholds and logic.
There's stuff in there which might addresses this.
