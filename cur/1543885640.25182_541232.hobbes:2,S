How would that confusion arise?  Only arch/.../board-xxx.c writers
normally even see spi_board_info; the exception is that someone who
writes an add-on board -- maybe a USB-to-SPI adapter -- would call the
rarely used spi_new_device() routine.
Developers writing a SPI drivers -- controller drivers touching some
SOC's serial controller hardware, or "struct spi_driver" protocol code
talking to a chip through such a controller -- never see board info.
They only see "struct spi_device".  So I don't see why they would have
a reason to be confused.
