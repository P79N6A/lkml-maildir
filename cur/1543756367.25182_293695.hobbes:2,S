Something broke my box after 2.6.10-ac8.  Both -ac11 and -ac12 cause
problems when backing up sata/md-raid/dm-snapshots/reiserfs to a SCSI
tape drive.  (Works fine when writing to /dev/null :-)
Backup started 1:30 a.m., errors messges start with:

etc. until hard reboot via sysrq-b
I found only one patch that seems to be related:

Can this by any chance cause my problems?
