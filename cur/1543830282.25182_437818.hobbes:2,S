it is impossible to have bridged networking, tun/tap and many other 
features without it. I even doubt that it is possible to introduce 
private netfilter rules w/o virtualization of routing.
The question is do we want to have fully featured namespaces which allow 
to create isolated virtual environments with semantics and behaviour of 
standalone linux box or do we want to introduce some hacks with new 
rules/restrictions to meet ones goals only?
 From my POV, fully virtualized namespaces are the future. It is what 
makes virtualization solution usable (w/o apps modifications), provides 
all the features and doesn't require much efforts from people to be used.
Thanks,
Kirill
