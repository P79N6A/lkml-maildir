The hardware for this driver comes in 30-, 32-, and 64-bit flavors. After determining which flavor
we have, the driver sends that information to the ssb driver, which actually handles the PCI
enabling. For the device that fails, I'm passing DMA_BIT_MASK(64) to the appropriate routine in ssb,
which calls dma_supported() with that mask. There are no other calls to any of the dma or pci mask
routines. I changed the dma_supported() to a set_dma_mask(), but it didn't make any difference. My
32-bit device works OK - just the 64-bit one fails.
