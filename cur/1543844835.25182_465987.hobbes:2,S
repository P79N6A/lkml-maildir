The other way around. Try to get rid of the evil includes in arch-$(ASM)
that is just sitting there for no other purpose than to let a developer skip
a single include.
In this case the right fix IMO would have been to kill the include of
linux/vmalloc.h from asm-i386/io.h and let all users that previously failed
to include vmalloc.h now do so themself.
Looking through asm-i386/io.h at fist look there is zero use of
linux/vmalloc.h so the include has no business there.
With this your patch would obviously be needed and on top of this we would
have to fix other places that 'forget' to include vmalloc.h but the good thing
would be that this is now a bit more consistent across architectures.
