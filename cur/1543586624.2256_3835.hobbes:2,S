I know there was a thread on this previously and I was thinking it had been
resolved (or was that only for a specific mobo mfg?).  When I finally got my
VIA chipset machine up to date with a 2.4.3 kernel I noticed the following on
boot up:
	PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:0a.0
	IRQ routing conflict in pirq table for device 00:0a.0
The only device on irq 11 is an agp voodoo3 card.  I don't seem to see any
negative effects (unless what I believe is an unrelated scsi error is tied to
this somehow).
Should I just disregard this message and assume it's a mobo quirk?  The mobo
in question is an AOpen AX59Pro with the current bios.  I can run any test
code or send futher system info if desired...
Tim
