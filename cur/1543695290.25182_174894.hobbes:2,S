You should provide more information before opening any bug, for example,
exact kernel version used, filesystems mounted and their types (as well
as mount options used). In older kernel 2.4.x versions there were
similar problems to the one you describe, related to (if I recall
correctly) writing the journal contents back to disk after heavy IO load.
