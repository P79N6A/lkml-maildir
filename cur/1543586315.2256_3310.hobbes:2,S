Yes, mine is a Comet - here's the exact detection message:
Mar 30 13:09:06 ulthar kernel: Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.14 (February
20, 2
001)
Mar 30 13:09:06 ulthar kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 00:0c.0
Mar 30 13:09:06 ulthar kernel: eth0: ADMtek Comet rev 17 at 0xb000,
00:20:78:0D:
D2:E1, IRQ 5.
I must say that I really appreciate the effort that all of the kernel
developers put in...
Thanks,
