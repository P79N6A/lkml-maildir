I have a problem with user quotas on alpha. The disk is NFS exported to
intel clients. Several times a day it happens that quotas reported
increase without apperant reason. If a large file is created over NFS and
removed several times, quota increases but does not decrease. If the limit
is reached, opened files get corrupted. quotacheck repairs the quota file,
but running that on large filesystems takes time...
Alpha and intel systems run RH 5.2 with 
 - kernel 2.2.2-ac4 (same problem for all 2.2.x)
 - knfsd-981204-3 
 - quota-1.66-3  
 - util-linux-2.9g
 - binutils-2.9.1.0.19a-1
