The problem is that sometimes you cannot have a filedescriptor at
all. Think about a PPS source connected with a CPU's GPIO pin. You
have no filedes to use and defining one just for a PPS source or for a
class of PPS sources, I think, is a non sense.
RFC simply doesn't consider the fact that you can have a PPS source
__without__ a filedes connected with, and a single filedes is
considered __always__ connected with a single PPS source.
Ciao,
Rodolfo
