The current state is not good either

Can you prove no existing application on the planet relies on the
existing behaviour ? Actually more limited but sane as a test would be
"Can you prove that the glibc behaviour visible to applications does not
change"

I disagree - firstly because of not breaking stuff, and secondly because
it separates two discussions - merging AppArmor being one of them , and
the correct behaviour for getcwd & /proc/mounts being the other.

Because the viewing apparatus on the other side of the monitor is not
operating in current directories/contexts.
