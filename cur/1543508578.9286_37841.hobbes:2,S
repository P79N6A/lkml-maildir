Take a look at 
http://www.close.u-net.com/
 and 
http://linmodems.org/
The Lucent winmodem driver is being reverse engineered, and they have
made a lot of progress already:  It can dial and detect the remote
modem's answer tones.  Code is available at the first URL above.
Also, PCTel has announced that a Linux driver for their [DPS-less]
winmodems went out to OEMs... though I have not seen anyone mention
seeing or obtaining such a driver yet.
