The sym53c875 detected a PCI data parity error while it was acting as a
master (i.e. doing DMA). This checking can be disabled from the boot
command line:
	sym53c8xx=mpar:n
If your system then runs stable, it may well be that the error is not
real. FYI, it seems that some rare combination of hardware + symbios chips
can trigger such errors without the DMAed data having been corrupted.
Another possibility might be that your hardware is actually broken.
You also may give a try with the ncr53c8xx driver. Historically, this
driver leaves unchanged the bit in the PCI COMMAND register that refers to
PCI parity error reporting. Given that BIOSes generally donnot set this
bit, any PCI parity error detected by the sym53c875 will be silently
discarded.
