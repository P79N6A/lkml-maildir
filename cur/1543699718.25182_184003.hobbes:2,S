| For now, my patch only allows up to around 10 kHz. At that frequency, I
| don't hear anything because the noise is not loud enough (ear is much

Stop! This is Linux we're talking about, if we can have Morse code panic
messages, we can certainly have the idle loop change frequency to play a
tune on the output capacitors (or whatever else make noise). How about
the Penguin army marching music from the Saturday morning cartoon, and
maybe hack LinuxBIOS to check for Windows running and have the idle loop
play Twilight of the Gods.
I better stop before someone actually does it.
