That's a physical interface like V.35 or RS232.

What's that?

I don't think so. Frame Relay uses only standard CRC. Correct me if I'm
wrong.

An (existing) union, of course. That's part of ifmap struct, with
meaning determined by ioctl command code.

Only one struct at a time :-)

> What type of operation do you mean by get/set ?
Get/set all device characteristics described by the struct.
For example, get/set interface type, clock type and rate. Or, with
other command(s), get/set Frame-Relay related parameters.

Do we really need another ARPHRD for that?
BTW: What protocol(s) use such CRC-less HDLC?
