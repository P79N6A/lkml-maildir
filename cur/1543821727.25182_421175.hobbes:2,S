Badari's usage case inspired me that on suspension we can
- first invoke a user-land tool to do all the cache
  status-logging/analyzing/selective-dropping jobs
- then let the kernel write all the remaining caches(made up of many
  small chunks) to the suspend image
And do the reverse things on restoring.
With that we moved all the strategies to userspace.
