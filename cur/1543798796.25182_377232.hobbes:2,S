Don't bother putting i386 in that list.
Quite frankly, you've done it before, and I think it's intellectually 
totally dishonest.
i386 does semaphores with a "lock decl". You CANNOT DO IT FASTER. I dare 
you. Why the hell do you try to make it sound as if x86 would need this 
new thing, when it absolutely does NOT need it.
Yes, x86 _also_ has an xchg instruction, but hey, that's a total 
non-argument. We don't actually use that. 
Of the other architectures you list, only ARM is really important. And no, 
arm doesn't do swap. It does LL/SC (except they call it "ldrex/strex", 
which I assume stands for "load/store with reservation and X just because 
X is cool. Yeah, we're cool" (*)).
68k is dead. Nobody cares. So just say it outright: this is totally just a 
FRV feature, and NOBODY ELSE IS IN THE LEAST INTERESTED.
Ok? Just to inject a little honesty here.

(*) Actually, some arm docs I found implies that "ex" stands for 
"exclusive", but that leaves me wondering what the "r" stands for?
