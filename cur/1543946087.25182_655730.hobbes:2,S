I've yet to see a user who wants WC. Lets face it, WC *sucks*. This is why
the folks who care about performance (the graphics guys) stopped using it.
WC is slow, and on modern cpus leads to really bad performance. I'm really
half tempted to just ignore WC entirely and suggest that we don't even implement
it in the kernel. Yes it's really that bad.
