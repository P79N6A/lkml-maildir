Several
-	We aren't about to release an official kernel right now afaik,
	there are bugs left to sort out first
-	Anyone can apply the patch themselves
-	Anyone can go and get a vendor kernel
-	Anyone can go and release their own 2.4.20.1 or 2.4.20-sec or
	whatever if they feel strongly about it
Just go do it. If someone wants to be a contact point for build existing
base kernels + published security fix trees I'm pretty sure kernel.org
would host them too.
