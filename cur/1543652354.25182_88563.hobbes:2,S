I agree.  You can simply drop the lock with no adverse consequences.

The queue doesn't need plugging, because only the error handler is a consumer 
of this function (which stops the queue as it begins and  restarts the queue 
on exit).  As Alan said, the lock stuff is a bit daft since the whole reason 
the new eh came into being was to do this from a kernel thread so you could 
sleep...

The API exists (scsi_block_requests, scsi_unblock_requests).  It was 
previously never really used because calling block_requests with no commands 
outstanding hung the driver.  However, this problem has been fixed.
The one thing this API doesn't do is stop timers on the outstanding commands, 
but that could be done too, probably by a flag passed in.
