If I understand well the only wrong thing I said is point (2). But if you
would read better my email I stated clearly that point (2) it not the pure
reality, but instead I said that it's a very good approximation of the
pure reality.

You should rereadd my previous email. I never said it's useless, I have
said that it's not worthwile.
You mean that a preemted process has all rights to preempt a even lesser
priority CPU. But ask you _why_ such process is been preempted. Simply
because in general we can see it as the _less_ priority one.
Also think that the preemted task has prev->processor pointing the only
not reschedulable CPU.

I agree that it's possible (I _never_ said the opposite) but my only 
comment is and was that I am not sure it's really worthwhile. I also said and
I repeat that as global design I prefer to have such call in schedule_tail
even if according to me it's only a performance _hit_.
