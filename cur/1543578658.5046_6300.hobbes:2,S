please try it with the focus CPU enabling change (we want to enable that
feature, i only disabled it due to the stuck-ne2k bug), but with
TARGET_CPUS set to cpu_online_mask. (this later is needed for certain
crappy BIOSes.)
i believe the ne2k driver change is the key.

does not help. I've tried it (and many other combinations). I did not find
any direct workaround for this problem. (i tried very hard.)
