I actually merged Lee's patch into -mm, copied James on it and then I
dropped it when I saw that it spat rejects against an updated version of
James's tree, assuming that it had been merged.
Often I'll check that a patch reverts successfully from the upstream tree
before dropping it, but for an obvious one like that I guess I didn't
bother, and assumed that James had taken it.  Only he hadn't - instead he'd
gone and merged something else, hence the rejects.   Oh well.
