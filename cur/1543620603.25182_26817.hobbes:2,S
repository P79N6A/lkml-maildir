Great I just want to say that sonypi in 2.4.18-pre9 works fine.
I have a vaio pcg qr10. This is the first kernel Version in which I can 
changing the background lite.
Just one Problem. Maybe a spicctrl Problem but if I try to get infos like:
spicctrl -p
BAT1: 2202/2479 88.83%
It works fine.
But sometimes (every 10 times) I get this:
BAT1: 2191/44975 4.87%
Or:
spicctrl -B
1
and than
spicctrl -B
100 (the right one)
As you can see I can get the battery status from spicctrl. But apm can't get 
the status, is there a way to enable apmd to use sonypi, or work correct.
This is the output from /proc/apm:
1.16 1.2 0x03 0x01 0xff 0x80 -1% -1 ?
At this time there was no AC only battery
spicctrl -p shows this:
BAT1: 2120/2479 85.52%
Is there a way to help you to get this problem fixed (I mean debug infos or 
something like this ;)
thanks
have fun
