The tty_init patch is gone, so ghash is the only nasty bit outside the arch
tree.

Yeah, it will be, but requires a bit of surgery.

Not sure about that.  hch complained about the cow driver last time, which
can disappear until there is something that vaguely works.

Yup.  I've come to the conclusion that I've painted myself into a corner a
bit with BK and my currently style of working.  I'm looking at quilt, and
I'm pondering taking all the changes since the last time Linus merged UML
(2.5.69 or something), and breaking them up into sensible patches.
That'll be a lot of work, but I think it's something that needs doing.
