How does the current reiser4 semantics break that?
In a reiser4 filesystem, a file _is_ a directory.
opendir() is supposed to succeed on it.
There's bound to be some security issue, but I'm not sure what you're
getting at with /tmp.  What sort of sort of security problem arises
with a world-writeable directory such as /tmp, that cannot arise with
the standard fs semantics?
