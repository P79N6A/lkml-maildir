> What's the meaning of the 65535 max limit in bios_cyl?
It is meaningless.
(Maybe there was some meaning long ago, for example because
HDIO_GETGEO only uses a 16-bit field for #cyls.
These days bios_cyl is not used anywhere. Not in the kernel,
not in user space. It is just some random number, computed
by taking disk-size / (heads*secs).)
