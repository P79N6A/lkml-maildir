No... I know of tg3.c:
        /* Configure DMA attributes. */
        if (!pci_set_dma_mask(pdev, 0xffffffffffffffffULL)) {
                pci_using_dac = 1;
                if (pci_set_consistent_dma_mask(pdev, 0xffffffffffffffffULL)) {
                        printk(KERN_ERR PFX "Unable to obtain 64 bit DMA "
                               "for consistent allocations\n");
                        goto err_out_free_res;
                }
        } else {
                err = pci_set_dma_mask(pdev, (u64) 0xffffffff);
                if (err) {
                        printk(KERN_ERR PFX "No usable DMA configuration, "
                               "aborting.\n");
                        goto err_out_free_res;
                }
                pci_using_dac = 0;
        }
As you can see it tg3 uses consistent_dma_mask = dma_mask so this one
doesn't need two masks.
Ok, I assume there is a real need for two masks. Still, having different
archs rely on different variables for the same task is a bug which needs
fixing.
Example:
$ grep DMA_MASK sound/oss/emu10k1/main.c
#define EMU10K1_DMA_MASK                0x1fffffff      /* DMA buffer mask for pci_alloc_consist */
        if (pci_set_dma_mask(pci_dev, EMU10K1_DMA_MASK)) {
Do you see a problem here? It will work if and only if pci_alloc_consistent
uses dma_mask rather than consistent_dma_mask.
Ok, I will make a patch which uses consistent_dma_mask for consistent allocs
on all archs. This will break drivers but they are already broken on
x86-64 and ia64, and it's easier to fix drivers than to write them when
the core is faulty.
Hope that it is ok?
