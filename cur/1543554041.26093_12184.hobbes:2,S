It booted but then it oops'ed before userland I belive.  I tried it this
morning and didn't have much time.  It did find the scsi controller (which
is across the bridge) and the drives attached so it does appear to be
working.  Maybe they can add that patch in for test11pre2 (or 3 if 2 is
already out)
