As I mentioned before I more like the byte approach, since atomic bit
field handling is quite expensive on most architectures, where a simple
set/clear byte is only one or two instructions, if there is byte
load/store instruction. So I'd really like to see to leave the decision to
the architecture, whether to use bit or byte fields.

That I can agree with. :)
