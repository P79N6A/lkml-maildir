Thanks.  Will fix.

I'll clarify it further.

Sounds like more clarifications :-)
A unionfs mount can be readonly or readwrite.  If it's readonly, none of the
branches will be written to.  If the union is readwrite, then the leftmost
(highest priority) branch must be writeable (for copyup to take place); the
remaining branches can be any mix of read-write and read-only.
In a writeable union, Unionfs will create new files in the leftmost branch.
If one tries to modify a file in a readonly branch/media, unionfs will copy
it up to the leftmost branch and modify it there.  If you try to modify a
file from a writeable branch which is NOT the leftmost branch, then unionfs
will modify it in that branch; this is useful if you, say, unify differnet
packages (e.g., apache, sendmail, ftpd, etc.) and you want changes to
specific package files to remain logically in the directory where they came
from.
