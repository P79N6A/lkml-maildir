Either of these two would work.  Another alternative could be to
let test_and_clear_pte_flags have an exception table entry, where
we jump right to the next instruction if the instruction clearing
the flag fails.
That is the essentially variant you need for Xen, except the fast
path is still exactly the same it is as when running on native
hardware.
