Some of us have already thought about it. :-) 
We have standard debugging macros that are used in many driver subsystems
defined in include/linux/device.h (dev_printk(), dev_dbg(), dev_err(), and
friends). The ACPI drivers are not very different than other Linux driver
subsystems (at a very basic level). They are very Linux-specific (not 
portable like the CA), and should be using Linux-specific constructs as
much as possible to match the rest of the kernel. This makes it much 
eaiser for people to understand exactly what those drivers are doing..
