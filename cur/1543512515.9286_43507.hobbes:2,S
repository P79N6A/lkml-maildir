NFSv3 only really cares about the contents of that arbitary device identity
in order to ensure a mknod on the server or client create the same device
viewed on both. That didnt used to be true in NFSv2 and could be a real
nightmare with managing NFS boxes before v3. 
The rest of the argument is valid even with NFS - and we do effectively
subdivide further.
