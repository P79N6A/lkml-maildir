okidok.... I got an new flashdisk from the vendor, but managed to ruin
it again. anyway, I also managed to repair it again. the vendor ships
a seperate formating-tool, which will repair the device, even when you
get "SCSI sense key errors".
however, I still don't understand what's going on and *why* it is not
allowed to format the drive "at will". I'd also would like to know how
this vendor supplied formating-tool works. Possibly some vendor-specific
usb-commands to ... do what? hm. I can only guess.
I purchased another driver (TraxData, USB-1, 6 euros cheaper and it
my mainboard can even boot from this device).
by the way: the manufacturer is Panram, www.panram.com.tw/ ... does anyone
of you have experience with them? Is it likely that one gets documentation
from them?
thx
