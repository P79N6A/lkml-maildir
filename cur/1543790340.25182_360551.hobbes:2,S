Yeah, that ktimer_interrupt patch was for something completely
different. Is this happening on boot up, or is this consistently
happening?
Also, Rui, do they show up at different times or clustered together?
(William, I see your output is clustered) The reason I asked, is that
the test may produce more than one warning message for the same time
warp. Since the time used to check for the time warp is not updated if
time goes backwards, so if you call the this routine more than once
before the time warp catches back up, it will warn again.

Is this SMP? And if so, do you get this with UP other than on boot up?
Unfortunately, all my test machines are running other tests that will
take all night to finish, so I can't look into this till tomorrow.
