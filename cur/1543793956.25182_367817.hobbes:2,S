I think it's harmless. I saw things like that, and initially I plugged
them with workarounds like this:
/*
 * Pete Zaitcev <zaitcev@yahoo.com>, from Patrick C. F. Ernzer, bz#162559.
 * The key does not actually break, but it returns zero sense which
 * makes our SCSI stack to print confusing messages.
 */
UNUSUAL_DEV(  0x0457, 0x0150, 0x0100, 0x0100,
		"USBest Technology",	/* sold by Transcend */
		"USB Mass Storage Device",
		US_SC_DEVICE, US_PR_DEVICE, NULL, US_FL_NOT_LOCKABLE ),
But perhaps we want the SCSI stack to do something about it, dunno.
If you're nervous about messages, use ub, it's mostly silent :-)
