How about I just explain it instead?  We preserve a criterion of nodes 
must be 50% full for internal nodes and criterion of no 3 nodes can be 
squeezed into 2 nodes for leaf nodes.
A tree that satisfies the criterion that no N nodes can be squeezed into 
N-1 nodes is an SN tree.  I don't remember where Konstantin Shvachko 
published his paper on this, maybe it can be found.
In Reiser4 we abandon the notion that fixed balancing criteria should be 
used for leaf nodes.
