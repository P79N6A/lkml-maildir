Of course it can't prevent shocks :-)
It can try to minimalize the impact of a shock though.
I am a happy owner of a X40. Just got it, so it still runs XP. The
software parks the heads of the disk if it detects movement. It is very
sensitive and quick so I believe it can protect the harddisk if the
notebook gets dropped during use.
In a car the software adapts to the usual bumps so the notebook is still
useful :-)
The windows software shows a picture of the notebook in 3D which tilts
if you tilt the actual notebook. Neat :-)
