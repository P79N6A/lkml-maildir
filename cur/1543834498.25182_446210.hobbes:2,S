That's a huuuuuge leap of logic.
Metadata plugins found in reiser4 are far better done at the VFS level, 
than burying "reiser4 can look like ext2, if it wishes" functionality 
inside the filesystem.
I guarantee such a patch to reiser3 would get rejected.

New stuff goes in all the time.
The bar is set too high in some cases (read: SCSI subsystem 
submissions), but reiser4 submission cannot be generalized as you have 
done here.  There are very real issues present, that need to be dealt with.

reiser4 tries to be another VFS.  That's a bit more than needing 
additional minor fixes over time.
