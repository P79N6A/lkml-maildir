Only if your ACK was within my SEQ window, which adds about 20 bits of
random when my initial window is 5840. You would then need to send one
million times more packets to achieve the same goal.

I agree with you on the fact that people who need security must use
secure protocols. I had the same words last year when people discovered
that a TCP RST could kill a BGP session, and the end of the internet was
announced. Hey, if someone needs secure BGP, he must use MD5 sums from
the start.
I'm not meaning to make TCP as secure as IPsec, but I think that when
supporting a feature (simultaneous connect) that nobody uses and many
OSes do not even support introduces a weakness, we could at least make
it optional. It could also rely on a #if CONFIG_TCP_SIMULT which will
slightly reduce kernel size for people who know they don't want it.
Cheers,
Willy
