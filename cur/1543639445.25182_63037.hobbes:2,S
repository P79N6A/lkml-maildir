Maybe we were looking for separate things - I had a firewall box with
100base-TX interfaces and when flooding it at full rate with small
(40 bytes, i.e. empty IP headers) packets the system was unusable
because of the interrupt rate. After I turned the bundling on, there
was no signs of overload. Of course, I tested throughput of the
card as well but on the IP level there was no difference I could
worry about. But as I said, this was a firewall box and I was looking
for a way to stop possible DOS, not for tiny packet delivery time
slowdown, which may be important in other applications.
