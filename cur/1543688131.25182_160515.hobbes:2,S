One thing to watch out for, with fftw:  I believe it will benchmark
various kernels, and decide which one to use, at run-time.  If the
scheduler fools it into thinking that a particular kernel is going to
perform better, it might do the wrong thing.
Does fftw have a switch to write a debug log?
("kernel" in this context means "the small section of code used to solve
the fft", not "the OS code running in privileged mode".)
