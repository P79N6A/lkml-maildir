Ahh, ok, I did indeed misread your code. Fair enough, then that's pretty
much equivalent to what I was asking for.
The reason I like sub-positions is that I worry that some application does
an lseek() to a position it already held earlier.
But you're probably right that it doesn't really matter, and as we really
have "pipe"  semantics we might as well dis-allow any lseek except to the
beginning (I know that there have been apps out there that avoid
re-opening /proc files by lseek'ing to zero and re-reading - they may not
be common enough to matter, though).
Ok, I'll re-read your patch with this in mind. But it sounds like I'm
going to approve of it with this background...
