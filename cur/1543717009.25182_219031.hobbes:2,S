It's usually best to keep increasing the number of SDET iterations that
you average against, at least until the averages start to become a bit
less bouncy.  Also, mounting ramfs on /tmp can _really_ help lower its
variability, probably because of gcc.  
You might be lucky enough to get some consistently good numbers that
way.
