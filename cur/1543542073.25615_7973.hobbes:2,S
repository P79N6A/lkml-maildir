You have that backwards. The uuencode command, including the
algorithm, is defined by The Single UNIX Specification, Version 2.
MIME is not a UNIX requirement; the standard does not contain
even a single mention of "MIME" or "mime".
If your uuencode is broken, submit a bug report just as you would
for a broken MIME encoder.
