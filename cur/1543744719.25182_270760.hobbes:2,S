Subject: Strange hang at init, kernel bug?

 I have this situation:
 computer A: ahtlon 1600 with fibre channel hard disks connected with
mpt fusion controller.
 computer B: dual pentium III with ide software raid.
 in computer A hard disks have unused partitions, so I connected
computer B to fc hard disks in A with another mpt fusion controller.
 I have tried with kernel 2.6.8-2.6.9 with/without kolivas, smp and
nosmp, etc.
 I have tried also raid/noraid smp/nosmp 
 I use debian/unstable, tried with different "init" packages.
 I copy using computer B the ide raid contents in fc hard disks (cp -a)
all ok without errors, I check filesystems: no errors.
 Now I reboot computer B from fibre hard disk and it hangs just after
init:
 I have tried with several file systems:
 - with reiser it says filesystem corrupted
 - with jfs it hangs with "respawning too fast"
 - with xfs it hangs with init: segmentation violation
 I boot the same partition with computer A and it works...
 I am desperate, what can I do?
 Thanks in advance for any reply!
