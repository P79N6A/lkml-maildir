Hi,
Here is my topology..(all m/cs are RH 5.2 with 2.2.3 )
Box1  <-----> Box2 <-----> Box3
Box 2 is a router..(cat  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward has value 1)..and
the kernel is compiled as a router..
The route table for box 2 is :: (slightly snipped..)
Destination     Gateway         Genmask          Iface
10.0.1.0        *               255.255.255.0    eth1
10.0.1.0        *               255.255.255.0    eth1
10.0.2.0        *               255.255.255.0    eth2
10.0.3.0        *               255.255.255.0    eth0
10.0.3.0        *               255.255.255.0    eth0
127.0.0.0       *               255.0.0.0        lo
(why the duplication in route table..??)
Now what happens is packets go from 1 to 2 and also from 2 to 3 but not
from 1 to 3..why is that..This used to work before..till all of a sudden
it
seemed to stop working..
Also from 1 and 3 I can ping all the interfaces of 2..
Any suggestions..??
Thanks,
Arni
