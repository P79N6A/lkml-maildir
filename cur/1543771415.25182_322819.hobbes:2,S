Yes, that's it! I've just successfully booted into 32-bit userspace (I 
have a separate partition with old 32-bit Debian) with x86_64 kernel and 
LATENCY_TRACE enabled. Everything seemed to work.
Then I mounted my normal root partition under /mnt/64 and tried
   chroot /mnt/64
I got a SIGSEGV. Then I copied some simple binaries from /mnt/64/bin to 
/root/test/bin and some necessary libraries to /root/test/lib and did
   chroot /root/test
I could run 64-bit sash, ls, cat, date, mkdir - it worked. 64-bit bash 
however segfaulted.
