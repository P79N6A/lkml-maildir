welcome to Unix.  this is how it is, and it's not just linux.  and it's
not just glibc/linuxthreads.  in your code do you go about setting all
signals to SA_RESTART?  if not then you're subject to the vagaries of
whatever the default signal settings are.
ted mentioned ^Z... there's also strace/truss/ktrace (depending on your
flavour of unix).  there's also page-out/in (and on some unixes there's
swap-out/in).
it's something which bites lots of folks.  gnu tar had this bug for at
least 5 years, and may still have it -- i got tired of submitting the bug
fix.
