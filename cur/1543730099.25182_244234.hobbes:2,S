Xorg and XFree assume the kernel will have intelligent limits. When the
range went up the EnableIO code in turn switched to ioperm.
The actual code is:
       if (ioperm(0, 1024, 1) || iopl(3))
                FatalError("xf86EnableIOPorts: Failed to set IOPL for
I/O\n")
(os-support/linux/lnx_video.c:xf86EnableIO)
Flip those around and rebuild.
