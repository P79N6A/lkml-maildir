Hi!
We have strange problem with Celeron on i810 mainboards here: machine
reproducibly hangs in test 8 from memtest, and randomly hangs running
linux. (Problem is not bad RAM, not bad powersupply, and not related
to powersaving).
It seems that heavy memory traffic just makes it hang, as soon as main
memory (not L2 cache) is hit.
CPU runs at 8.5x bus clock, ISTR something was wrong with half
multipliers somewhere.
Unfortunately, Intel's web is less than helpful:

> which may cause the product to deviate from published specifications. Current

...so perhaps someone else can help?
