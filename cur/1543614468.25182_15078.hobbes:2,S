Well, there were not so much reports like yours on this list recently,
which should mean something.

You can make a backup first.

You've just described the way I tracked down memory problems several years ago ;)

Perhaps several samples of corrupted files (and their original versions),
also make sure that while this corruption occurs with reserfs on the new drive, it
does not occurs with non-reiserfs filesystem on the new drive.
Also try to copy your files and see if you get random corrupted files or is the corrupted
filelist is the same all the time.
Look into your log for any strange messages. (you might even recompile your
kernel with CONFIG_REISERFS_CHECK enabled to allow for more checks to be made)
