It obviously depends on number of modules / size of vmlinux.
With x86_64 and defconfig + all oss drivers configured as modules the
modpost stage takes around 0.2 sec in total. So this is down in the
noise level. Building allmodconfig kernel atm and if I see > 2 sec
difference with and without the check I will do a follow-up post.
Obviously the more modules with problems the longer time. So I will
skip the warning messages in the measurements since I assume they will
be taken care of.
