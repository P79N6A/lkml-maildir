If you don't mean "kill -TERM", no there isn't. It would be evil
to the process anyway.
Some[1] programs ask their resource limits on startup to scale to a
sane amount of memory usage for caching, operation buffers and
the like. If your readjust it to sth. smaller, they'll be killed
soon and if you readjust to sth, bigger, they wouldn't use it.

[1] I would like to write "most programs", but most programs
   assume, that they will never run out of memory and leave it to
   the administrator/user to care for this issue :-(
