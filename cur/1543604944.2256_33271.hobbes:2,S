Nice function. Used to use it. 2.4.8. 2.4.12-going-on-13 and it's no
longer there. No BH_Protected field in the bh either.
OK, so how do I stop buffers being reclaimed now? My intention
is to keep the buffer hanging around forever once I have written to it,
so that further reads to that block of my device return the buffer
content without ever getting to my device (that's right, write-once,
read-many).
He's off to read the ramdisk code, tara, tarum, tara ...
