Subject: [PATCH] fix trident.c lockup on module load 2.4.22-rc1

Hi Marcelo, 
This patch fixes a kernel lockup with 2.4.22-rc1 when the trident.c
driver is loaded and the driver attempts to initialize the card. The
problem is that in ali_ac97_get() we lock the card->lock spinlock, but
never release it on the good path, only on the error path. This patch
adds the missing spin_unlock_irqrestore().
Patch is against 2.4.22-rc1-cvs, tested and works, and fixes a pretty
severe lockup bug. Please apply. 
Cheers, 
Muli.
