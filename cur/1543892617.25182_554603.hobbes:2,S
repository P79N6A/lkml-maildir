Yes I figured it was a hardware problem, but that was not really the 
point I was trying to raise ;). I would like, if possible for Linux to 
automatically fallback to USB 1.1 like Windows does (preferably with a 
suitable warning).
Regarding getting the systemboard replaced, this machine is already 
scheduled for replacement, and I should be getting a new one in the next 
few weeks. But other users apparently have been having similar problems, 
and might not want to get the (presumably out-of-warranty) systemboard 
replaced.
