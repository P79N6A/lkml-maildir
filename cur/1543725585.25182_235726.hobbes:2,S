Dan,
We have some patches that we use at TimeSys that allow a linux kernel to
build on cygwin.  They fall under:
1. case insensitive issues
2. kconfig using shared library
3. header file issues under some cygwin versions (typically types.h)
4. arguments handling limited to 32K (large number of modules are issues
in Makefiles)
1 and 2 have already been discussed and Chris Faylor mentioned just a
while ago that with managed mounts under newer cygwin versions, this is
not a big issue for cygwin at least.
Sometime later today, I will send in the patches we are using for 2.6.6
that allow a full build, in case they are useful (at least the arguments
handling patch is a kludge, but I will send it in to start with).
