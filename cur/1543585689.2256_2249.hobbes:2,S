Well, in that case you'll have to live with the current OOM
killer.  Martin wrote down a pretty detailed description of
what's wrong with my algorithm, if it really bothers him he
should be able to come up with something better.
Personally, I think there is more important VM code to look
after, since OOM is a pretty rare occurrance anyway.
regards,
Rik
