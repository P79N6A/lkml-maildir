Presumably not all architectures are doing that.   And some of the problems
we've had are with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n.

That seems a quite bad idea.  If we know which CPUs are possible we should
populate cpu_possible_map correctly, whether or not CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is
set.  Setting all the bits like that wastes memory and wastes CPU cycles.

That comment came from the tender pinkies of pj@sgi.com, although I suspect
it was just a transliteration of then-current practice.
