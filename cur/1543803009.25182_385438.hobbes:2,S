OK I'm just going to close that bug, the one person who seemed to know
anything about it had this to say:
"The cyberpro 5050 is an old combined video+audio controller - and
is/was used in some settop boxes (German Siemens Activity and also
Loewe).
There will be no "desktop users" around.
And because I don't work for Loewe anymore: I don't have access to
hardware.
If you ask me: leave it out!"
Anyone who finds one of these is free to reopen it.
