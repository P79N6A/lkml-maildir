Ok, that's a new trick ;)

Yes.  The iret faults, the fault pushes a new kernel frame - and the 
fault handler's iret returns, removing the kernel frame.  So the kernel 
frame is gone by the time the fixup runs.

It's really hard to catch bugs that could otherwise happen when a 
non-zero based stack gets used (for example, C code which uses %ebp with 
-fomit-frame-pointer).  Setting the limit to THREAD_SIZE should 
guarantee that the non-zero based stack never is used to access anything 
but the stack and current thread.
