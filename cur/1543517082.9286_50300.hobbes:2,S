I'm pretty sure that we err on the side of paranoia here sometimes.  There
is a LOT of software which depends on us being right, and it's better to
hedge than to get an extra cycle or two and lose something due to other
troubles...
But, it is not needed to avoid any kind of re-ordering that IA32 will
do.  I still maintain that.
IA32 just doesn't do program visible reordering.  Any reordering is
done only as a performance enhancement and with temporary results that
are checked prior to becoming committed state.

No.
To guarantee that you've observed the store to "i", you HAVE to read
the store to "j" first!  Plus, your second "for" loop could have blocked
just after reading "i" into "a", while the first loop could be continuing
to count upward.  "b" could end up with an arbitrarily larger value.
To make this work correctly in the face of both Processor Ordering
and pauses in the process execution, the second loop should actually say:
	for (;;) {
		b = j;
		a = i;
		if (a < b)
			BUG();
	}
With Weak Ordering, this could fail, since you may have not gotten
all the updates to "i" yet.
What you know from Processor Ordering is:
	If you see a particular store from processor A, you know you've
	seen all PRIOR stores in program order from processor A.
This means you have to gate relying on data from another processor until
you've checked that you have seen kind of "completion event".
This is exactly what you get with a spinlock situation:
	P0				P1
	X = 0;
	spin_unlock(Y);  // does a store to Y
					spin_lock(Y);
					READ  X;
So, P0 does the stores to X, then Y, P1 waits for the store to Y,
which guarantees P1 will see the right data in X.
