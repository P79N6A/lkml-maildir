Maybe it is related.
This is at least a Sony Vaio problem, because attaching the same USB
device to other PCs with the same (kernel)installation works without
problems.
It was checked to be USB-device-independent with the Vaio (same problem
with any device).
Because USB even works on the Vaio under Windows, the USB developers
(uhci) told me to look in linux-kernel for the PCI/IRQ programmers due
to a potentially broken BIOS ("IRQ routing problem")- that's where I am
now (?).
A kernel without the patch results in the same non-recognition
(non-USB-number-assignment) of the USB device, but when booting I get
errors concerning a multiple reservation of IRQ9. With the patch there
are no errors of that kind (see last mail). And the "feature", that USB
works when the shared interrupt is busy (same effect with unpatched
kernel), makes me feel that there is a IRQ problem, specific to Sony
Vaio. So, the PnP-BIOS-patch is my hope because it cares about Sony Vaio
(BIOS/IRQ?) specials.
Very hopefully,
