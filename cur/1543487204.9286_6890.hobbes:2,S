I had NT4WS and RHL5.1 on a machine, with NT installed on FAT16. (I actually
removed NT recently and now have the entire machine for Linux :-)
I used the NT bootloader to start Linux, by running LILO on the linux
bootsec, and dd'ing the linux bootsec to a file in the C: drive. 
Every new kernel, I had to do both steps (LILO followed by DD), but then I
told lilo.conf to write the bootsec code directly to the /mnt/c/bootsec.lin
file which also worked like a charm. If NTFS support under Linux is still
read-only (dunno, not running NT any more:-), this will of course only work
with NT bootloader on a FAT16 partition.
