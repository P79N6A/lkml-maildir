Hmmm..... This is a performance issue for preempt kernels.

Here we potentially loose our per cpu structure since the process may be 
rescheduled.

One additional cacheline referenced in the hot path. Ok the counter may be 
hot as well if this is a preemptible kernel. Nevertheless a cause for 
concern.
