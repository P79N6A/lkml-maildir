just changed line 13 on kexec.h from:
"long kexec_load(void *entry, unsigned long nr_segments, struct
kexec_segment *segments, unsigned long);"
to:
"long kexec_load(void *entry, unsigned long nr_segments, struct
kexec_segment *segments, unsigned long flags);"
and it gives me this error:
# ./do-kexec.sh /boot/bzImage-2.6.2-g
kexec_load failed: Function not implemented
entry       = 0x91764
nr_segments = 2
segment[0].buf   = 0x80b3480
segment[0].bufsz = 1880
segment[0].mem   = 0x90000
segment[0].memsz = 1880
segment[1].buf   = 0x40001008
segment[1].bufsz = 19795a
segment[1].mem   = 0x100000
segment[1].memsz = 19795a
