I'm getting these errors after about 15d of uptime:
Jan 27 17:43:18 mir kernel: NFS: giant filename in readdir (len 955ae5)!
Jan 27 21:06:14 mir kernel: NFS: giant filename in readdir (len 74000000)!
And doing an ls (ie. readdir()) inside an NFS-mount always produces
an empty directory listing. I can still access files and
subdirectories OK, though.
This seems to be a problem on the client side and only occurs when
using NFSv3. When I unmount and then remount using NFSv3, the problem
persists, but goes away once I remount with nfsvers=2. Also I tried
downgrading the other server's kernel to 2.4.21 and the problem still
persisted until I remounted with NFSv2.
I'll wait and see wether the downgrade helped on the client side, but
that might take a few days.
Both boxes have an almost identical setup of Slackware 9.1 and were
running 2.4.23-pac1+security bugfixes. The boxes are connected to the
same switch and VLAN. They mount filesystems from each other (yeah, I
know cross-mounting with NFS is a bad idea...) and the problem
occurred on both servers simultaineously.
The mounts look like this:
mir:/home on /home type nfs
(rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,lock,addr=XXX)
mir:/archive on /archive type nfs
(rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,soft,intr,addr=XXX)
sputnik:/var/spool/mail on /var/spool/mail type nfs
(rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,lock,nfsvers=2,addr=XXX)
sputnik:/files on /files type nfs
(rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,soft,intr,nfsvers=2,addr=XXX)
I tried searching with Google but couldn't find a resolution to this
problem. I did find references of it occurring as far back as 2002.
Any ideas, folks?
