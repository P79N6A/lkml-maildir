Yes, you're right. I just checked. Only the encrypted traffic passes the
netfilter rules, never the unencrypted data. So if you open the
protocols 50 and 51, the encrypted data can pass, gets
encrypted/decrypted and that data can always pass unchecked.
These packets should get reinjected into the netfilter mechanism after
decryption and should pass the rules before getting encrypted.
