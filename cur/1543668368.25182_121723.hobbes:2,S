I have been considering that. I'd suggest this would be more than
just a boolean. I could imagine using the lowermost bit to decide
if ptrace is allowed for root, and the next bit to decide if
ptrace is allowed for other users. But do we really want this
sysctl? When do we expect the next root exploit in ptrace?
