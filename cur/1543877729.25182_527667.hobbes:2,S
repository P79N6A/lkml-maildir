So, a kernel_thread should call freezer_exempt(FE_XXX) somewhere at the
beginning if it doesn't want to be considered as freezeable. But what if
the freezing is already in progress? In that case freezer_exempt() should
somehow clear TIF_FREEZE (if exempt_freeze_event doesn't match freeze_event
parameter of freeze_processes()), otherwise we may hit a nasty bug, much
worse than a freezing failure (which could be restarted).
try_to_freeze_tasks() succeeds because the task is !freezeable(), the
task goes to refrigerator (while it should not), thaw_tasks() ignores
process and it stays frozen.
Alternatively, we can do a re-check in refrigerator() to fix this race.
In any case, it looks like freeze_event should be stored in a global var.

This is a real nitpick, but it was hard to me to understand this change.
Because it looks as if we have a subtle reason to set TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
before freezer_exempt(). Unless I missed something, I'd suggest to move
freezer_exempt() up, before set_current_state().
The same for apm_mainloop().
