Small suggestion - when your thread is created, make sure that all /proc
accesses to stuff relating to this thread doesn't cause the kernel to panic.
I used to create some processes with '0' as the third arg until Debian's
start-stop-daemon script started killing peoples machines with a kernel
oops.  Now I always use CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND as per
fs/buffer.c (which I used as the reference for creating kernel threads).
