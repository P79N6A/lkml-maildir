Hi
 I have cpu frequency scaling with p4-clockmod in my kernel, and until
v2.6.15 I was possible to set governors and custom frequencies at
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/*.
When I changed the governor or the frequency scaling_cur_freq
represented the change.
With 2.6.16 this isn't possible anymore, I didn't change anything in the
kernel .config, just did 'make oldconfig'. There is no 'cpufreq'
subdirectory in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/ anymore.
I think this user has the same problem:
