Same problem with a SMP + an UP, both 2.2.14aa10 (Linux _ONLY_),
only one keyboard, one screen and one mouse
connected with a master view switch-box (electronic).
Setting the SMP at lowest possible rate (1 sec, for SYSRQ),
the UP ignores his original rate, set in BIOS and with YaST,
and runs also at >= 1 sec rate.
Please cc me in replies as I'm not a subscriver.
