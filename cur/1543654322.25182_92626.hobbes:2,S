From memory, if both ACPI and APM are enabled, the ACPI notices the APM
and doesn't enable (or partially disables). Have you tried booting a RH
kernel with "noapm" to see if ACPI is there and would work for you if APM
were not there?
Do note, I haven't gone back to look at the RH config, I will try it for
grins the next time I reboot.
