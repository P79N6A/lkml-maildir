I liked this idea, and was working on implementing it when I ran into a
few roadblocks.  Your ideas are welcome.
First, "preempt_count()" is used as an l-value in a lot of places, i.e.
look at all the "preempt_count() += foo" in the IRQ code.  We cannot
mask things out of it.
Thus, I then looked into doing a separate function for the raw value,
say an "atomic_count()" ... the code just looked ugly mixing
"atomic_count()" and "preempt_count()" for no apparent reason.
Third, PREEMPT_ACTIVE actually _is_ part of the count.  It helps assure
us a task is not preempted repeatedly.  If we did not have it, we would
have to bump preempt_count on preemption.  So we still need it in the
preempt_count().
Simplest solution is to:
	#define in_atomic() \
		(preempt_count() & ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE) != kernel_locked())
although I still dislike the masking just to make the schedule()
code-path cleaner.
Oh, and there is another problem: printk() from schedule() implicitly
calls wake_up().  My machine dies even with just a printk() and not a
BUG()... I suspect there may be some SMP issue in that whole mess too,
because setting oops_in_progress prior did not help.
Comments?
