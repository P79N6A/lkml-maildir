Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add support to map multiple blocks in get_block() and remove get_blocks()

Hi,
Following patches add support to map multiple blocks in ->get_block().
This is will allow us to handle mapping of multiple disk blocks for
mpage_readpages() and mpage_writepages() etc. Instead of adding new
argument, I use "b_size" to indicate the amount of disk mapping needed
for get_block().
Now that get_block() can handle multiple blocks, there is no need
for ->get_blocks() which was added for DIO. Second patch removes
them.
[PATCH 1/2] map multiple blocks in get_block() for mpage_readpages()
[PATCH 2/2] remove ->get_blocks() support
Andrew, Please let me know if you want to pick these up into -mm
tree, since they need to be integrated with Mingming's ext3 multiblock
support.
Comments ?
Thanks,
Badari
