Greetings All.
I feel dumb as never so please enlight me. Is ther a way to find out which
process is on the other end of a unix socket pointed by a specified fd in a process.
Lets say that I have got a process gconfd-2. I've straced it and got:
writev(25, [{"GIOP\1\2\1\0\267\1\0\0", 12},....
now I look at lsof
COMMAND     PID     USER   FD   TYPE     DEVICE SIZE  NODE NAME
gconfd-2   2282 jdoe       25u  unix 0xc55a9380       4222 socket
and netstat
Proto RefCnt Flags       Type       State         I-Node PID/Program name  Path
unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     4222     2282/gconfd-2
OK, fine when the gconfd-2 has written the data something's had to read it. I
ask: How can I find what has read the data? Forgive me if it's trivial but I
really find no way to learn it. Neither in /proc nor using some tools like above.
Best regards.
PS. please don't forget to CC.
