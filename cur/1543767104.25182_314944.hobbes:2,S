Subject: [QUESTION] why redhat and others disable lcall7/lcall27?

All redhat kernels contain the patch given below which disables 
lcall7/lcall27. Why? I've heared from some people that these calls are 
insecure or something like that. But what is the real problem with it?
Why mainstream kernel still keeps these calls then?
