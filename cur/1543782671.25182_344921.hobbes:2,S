Overmount_rootfs shouldn't take place until you know for sure the
kernel detects an initramfs.
I know the patch only has one purpose and you can assume the user is
using it just for that, but if the user uses the patched kernel without
an initramfs it runs overmount_rootfs anyway.
Also, in shmem.c init_tmpfs isn't run because it assumes that
overmount_rootfs will be, so if the kernel is being used in a
non initramfs way (tmpfs isn't registered). 
   #ifndef CONFIG_EARLYUSERSPACE_ON_TMPFS
   module_init(init_tmpfs)
   #endif /* !CONFIG_EARLYUSERSPACE_ON_TMPFS */
