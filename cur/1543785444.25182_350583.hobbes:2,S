well, in theory this works as well.  If you do this in the kernel source 
directory:
make allmodconfig
that makes a kernel with all possible configure options that can be built as 
modules enabled.
make install
and you have a couple of nice files in /lib/modules/(version)/modules.*map
-rw-r--r--  1 root root    73 Sep 14 23:15 modules.ieee1394map
-rw-r--r--  1 root root   132 Sep 14 23:15 modules.inputmap
-rw-r--r--  1 root root    81 Sep 14 23:15 modules.isapnpmap
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7834 Sep 14 23:15 modules.pcimap

the usual favorite of mine is modules.pcimap, which, when compined with lspci 
can give you the proper module for your pci device.  Granted it has the fault 
of a) how to figure out the configure option.  Sometimes it's CONFIG_[name], 
sometimes it's not (grepping maybe?) b) sometimes two drivers do the same 
thing, but if enabled together will cause kittens to cry and babies to pull 
flowers.  Therein lies one of the main issues.  I'm going to assume by seeing 
the rules_file bit that you address it in that way.  However, seeing the 
development model of the kernel, trying to keep that updated may get a little 
weird.
