What backdoor?  Please spell it out.  Plugins are not dynamically 
loadable.

Hunh?  No, target market is hackers who like to spend a weekend dreaming 
up funky new kinds of files.  One guy (Jason Holt, clever guy) came up 
with an idea for write only files for which even root cannot read the 
parts of the file written prior to the time root was achieved, because 
the encryption key is changed in a forward computable only direction 
with every write, and the start key is kept on another computer.  Lots 
of folks will have plugins I would never dream of.   Think of photoshop 
plugins, and what plugins did for photoshop.  Same thing will happen to 
reiser4 next year (or earlier).

I am one of those free software hippy-child anarchists who thinks that 
random people should come up with ideas and contribute them.  You 
understand me well.;-)
