Just curious, do you know of any system where that recommendation was
not followed? On all motherboards where I have seen a AMD-8131 or a
AMD-8132, they were alone on their hypertransport link, and other
"northbridges" (more precisely hypertransport to pci-express or
pci-whatever, often nvidia) with a "MMCONFIG BAR" where on one of the
other available hypertransport links in the system.
