Please the kexec_jump code just be triggered off of a flag in
struct kimage.  We just need to define an extra flag to sys_kexec_load
say KEXEC_RETURNS.  Ideally in the long term we would not have to
do anything except to accept the flag.  Adding a flag makes
a nice feature test if you want to see if your kernel supports
the extended version of kexec.
Until we get the hibernation methods sorted out storing the flag in
struct kimage and making the methods that we call conditional feels
like a more maintainable interface.  Especially since we have to
know at kexec image load time what we are going to do with the
kexec image.

I understand where you are coming from with this implementation of
kexec_jump but it looks like this is one of the big parts of this
patch that have not reached their final form.
The line above is racy with sys_kexec_load.

This as everyone knows needs to be device_shutdown or a better hibernation
replacement.

Can't we just catch the noboot cpu's in a mutex.
disable_nonboot_cpus is actually impossible to implement 100% reliably
with current hardware.  But something smp_call_function so we trap them
at a specific location and then the equivalent when we come back should
be simple.  I guess the tricky part is bringing the cpus back up again.
Using the broken by design version of cpu hotplug really annoys me here.

This of course should go away when we have the proper methods.

This line might even be reasonable.

Yep this can go away.

I haven't looked at the cpu start up code yet to see if it
is generally implementable.  I would think so, but I guess
we need to be careful with our data structures.

This of course should change.

Odd.  I'm a little surprised that the console is the last
thing we restore.  But it does make sense to treat it specially.
