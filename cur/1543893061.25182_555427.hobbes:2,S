  from kernel/module.c:
...
        ks = lookup_symbol(name, __start___ksymtab_gpl_future,
                                 __stop___ksymtab_gpl_future);
        if (ks) {
                if (!gplok) {
                        printk(KERN_WARNING "Symbol %s is being used "
                          "by a non-GPL module, which will not "
                          "be allowed in the future\n", name);
                        printk(KERN_WARNING "Please see the file "
                          "Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt "
                          "in the kernel source tree for more "
                          "details.\n");
...
  but there's nothing in the feature removal file that expands on that
issue.  (there *is* an entry regarding *unused* symbols, but that
doesn't seem to address the above.)
