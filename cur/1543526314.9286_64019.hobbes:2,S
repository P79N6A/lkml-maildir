Hello,
finally have a working 2.3.46 kernel... only one problem I have
with ..44, 45, .46 the login program has become horribly slow.  At the
login screen after typing my password it takes up to 2 minutes for it to
log me in.  Rebooting back to 2.3.34 and it works perfectly, logging in
almost instantaneously.
Were there any changes that might have caused this?  Should I upgrade
packages?
I have a K6-2 350, 64 megs of Ram, glibc2.1 system [an old slackware
install upgraded over the years].  I think the version of login I have is
from a fairly recent version of the shadow-utils.
A strace shows this happening
gettimeofday({...}, NULL)               = 0
getpid()                                = 360
socket(PF_UNSPEC, SOCK_??? (0), , 0)    = 3
getpid()                                = 360
bind(0, NULL, 0)                        = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
ioctl(3, FIONBIO, 0xbfffe110)           = 0
sendto(0, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 0)          = 56
select([...][...])                      = 0
sendto(0, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 0)          = 56
select([...][...])                      = 0
sendto(0, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 0)          = 56
select([...][...])                      = 0
sendto(0, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 0)          = 56
select([...]
with the above repeating over and over.....
on a semi-unrelated note starting with kernel 2.3.45 the system time has
been reset to 1 January 1997 whenever I reboot, but I think this might be
a BIOS problem, since it also happened after I changed my parallel port to
be ECP mode and wrote that to CMOS....
thanks for any help...
Vince
