I guess it would make sense to file this as a bug in the gcc
bugzilla
Another useful enhancement might be to have a -finline-string-functions
or similar that could be set with -Os. In general I've been wondering
for some time if the kernel really doesn't need some new optimization
setting somewhere between -Os and -O2. -Os occasionally has a few other 
bad side effects too.
