Just for reference (as its not in the thread linked above), this issue
disappeared for me after some config changes (I somehow changed my
selection when I backtracked and then moved forward w/ git bisect).
I've not been able to reproduce it since, but I know others (BCC'ed on
this note) have seen it and might prod them to come forth with details
(and broken .config files)
thanks
