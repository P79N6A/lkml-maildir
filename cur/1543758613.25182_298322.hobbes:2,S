Thanks.  Many of these fixups are due to a 64-bit-resource patch in Greg's
bk-pci tree which he has now reverted.  That being said:
- That patch will come back sometime
- Fixes like the below make sense anyway and can be merged any time.
- All the fixes which were only applicable when the 64-bit-resource patch
  is present have been sent to Greg for when that patch reemerges.
