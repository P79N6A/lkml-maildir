I can't comment on that combination, but have been using the reverse
(ne built in and ne2k-pci as a module) for some time without problems.
Are you sure you're not suffering from the fact that ne as a module
lacks some of the functionality it has when it's built in?

If it's true, it needs to be documented...
Best wishes from Riley.
