	I had the same problem with my M/B. Last week it was posted to the
list a patch from Walter Hofmann <Walter.Hofmann@physik.stud.uni-erlangen.de> 
which puts the system in real mode before shutting down, so non-compliant
APM BIOS can halt the system. I send it attached; it is against
linux-2.2.2. Try it if you like and tell Walter if it works in your
system.
	The patch works nicely on my system; it powers off again.
	Anyway, it wouldn't be a bad thing if you checked your M/B
manufacturer's web site, to see if you can find an updated BIOS fully
32bit compliant. If not, you could/should ask'em to fix it. It seems that
certain manufacturers are becoming a bit more sensitive about linux users,
and are updating his BIOSes (after what I read in a couple of messages to
this list).
	Good luck and good hunt!-)
