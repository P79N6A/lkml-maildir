Hey.
I saw the new LED subsystem in 2.6.17.1 (maybe earlier, but maybe it's
been expanded?) and I thought of some ideas for more classes and
triggers.
Classes:
	Keyboard LED's
	Various laptop LED's (Asus, others)
Triggers:
	CPU busy (could include varieties such as user, system, IO wait, etc.
	network device transmit/receive
	wireless device state (associated or not)
	per-disk read/write
	RAID array status
I'm willing to try to write some of these, but I've never worked on any
kernel before, and I'm pretty new to C.  If someone's willing to answer
a few annoying questions as I go, I could probably get some of it done.
Anyway, the LED subsystem looks really cool.  I've always wanted the
kernel to be able to control my blinkenlights instead of having to write
shell scripts.  Keep up the good work!
