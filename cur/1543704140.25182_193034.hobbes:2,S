I'm using grub from RedHat 9. I did have redhat installed on my 3rd disk 
and moved it to my
raid array (a lot later). When I installed it, i had to install grub on 
floppy,
boot from floppy, enter command-line and install to HDD from floppy. 
This is because
the grub from redhat (i mean after you booted) doesn't detect the RAID 
correctly, and still sees
hd0 as the primary master disk (hda, my 3rd disk).
Anyway, this is what i've done, and it works. I actually installed it on 
the ext3 partition (from my
raid) , and the MBR is the "standard" one from windows, with the ext3 as 
primary (so I can
reinstall the other OS anytime without reinstalling grub).
