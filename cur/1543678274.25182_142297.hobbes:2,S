Because often that lock protects driver-internal objects that are used
by all queues.
Prefered variant (actually, we'll have to do it in 2.5 anyway) is to
allocate request_queue dynamically.  Just put a pointer to it into nbd_device.
BTW, could you please kill the ..._t silliness?  There is nothing wroung
with using 'struct nbd_device' directly.

htonl() honours constants.  If it doesn't, we are in for much more serious
problems, simply because a lot of codepaths in networking are using it.
A lot.  IOW, you are obfuscating code for no good reason (and add an extra
memory access, thus giving actually worse code - it's not an optimisation
at all).
