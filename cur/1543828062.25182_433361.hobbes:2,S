That's inherent in NUMA. No good way around that.
We have a similar problem with caches because we don't color them. People
have learned to live with it.

I tried something like this a few years ago and it just didn't work
(or rather ran usually slower) The scheduler would select a home node at startup and 
then try to move the process there. 
The problem is that not using a CPU costs you much more than whatever
overhead you get from using non local memory.
So by default filling the CPUs must be the highest priority and memory 
policy cannot interfere with that.
