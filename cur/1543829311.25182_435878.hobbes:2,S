It's not that they no longer ship it, it's that when they're not careful
enough about their updates an rely on the "testing" tree, they get their
compiler automatically upgraded to 4.0. At least from what I've been told,
since I don't use this distro myself. They always have the option to reinstall
an older one but it's not intuitive to them at first glance. Fortunately,
there's a clear error message now.
