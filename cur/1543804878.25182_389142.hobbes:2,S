Just as a curiosity... does anyone have any guesses as to the runtime 
performance cost of hosting one or more swap files (which thanks to on demand 
creation and growth are presumably built of blocks scattered around the disk) 
versus having one or more simple contiguous swap partitions?
I think it's probably a given that swap partitions are better; I'm just 
curious how much better they might actually be.
Cheers,
