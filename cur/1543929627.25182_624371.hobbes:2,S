I suspect that the best option is probably to make that thing a unnamed 
union of the actual different types the different restart cases needs, 
which also allows you to name things appropriately and not have any wasted 
space.
Leave the arg0-3 ones around as one of the unions, both to avoid having to 
change other things and to have a "generic" one for stuff that simply 
doesn't much care (in order to not have tons and tons of substructures to 
the union when most users really don't need any fancy types).
I think we already depend on recent-enough gcc's that unnamed unions are 
ok and we don't need to play games with naming.
