Luben,
Here was your entry point to state SCSI uses "taskfiles" in the packet
transport.

Not everyone has to be a "storage engineer", but a "storage engineer" must
be able to explain to any OS developer/engineer the scope of the transport
and work within the OS or explain why a change is required.
