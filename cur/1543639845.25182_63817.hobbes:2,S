Note that I personally think the "you screw with me, I screw with you"  
approach is a fine one. After all, the GPL is based on "you help me, I'll
help you", so it fits fine.
However, it doesn't work due to the distributed nature of the GPL. The FSF
tried to do something like it in the GPL 3.0 discussions, and the end
result was a total disaster. The GPL 3.0 suggestion was something along
the lines of "you sue any GPL project, you lose all GPL rights". Which to 
me makes no sense at all - I could imagine that there might be some GPL 
project out there that _deserves_ getting sued(*) and it has nothing to do 
with Linux.
