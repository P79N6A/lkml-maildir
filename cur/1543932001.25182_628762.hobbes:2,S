Hi folks,
Is there a way to replace the system beep by something more
melodic?
I remember some 10 years ago there was a patch for the kernel
to call an external "beep daemon" playing an audio file instead
(no kidding). But it never worked very well. Sometimes there
was a huge delay, and some programs were not very nice to the
system beep.
My X-mas wish would be to get an improvement here.
Regards
Harri
