From my current troubles I have the confirm that flushtime = 0 is needed
in the io_completation callback.
My problem now is that with a real 50 delay before update will flush
buffers back to disk, under heavy I/O, on my system dirty buffers have all
the time grows too much and so mark_buffer_dirty is forced to call bdflush
by hand, and this cause all processes to block waiting for bdflush I/O
completation!!
So with this flushtime-bug fixed by my previous patch, in order to get
performance back, I need to rebalance the system with sane sysctl values
that previously wasn't needed due the flushtime-bug.

This way I get improved and my system doesn't stall as with the two
previous patch applyed while doing heavy I/O.
The if (buffer_uptodate(tmp)) was wrong, I meant !buffer_dirty(tmp), the
point is that I don't want to put dirty buffers in the top of the list in
order to make sure to sync them, but it's not relevant for the performance
system-completly-stalled-all-the-time issue.
This third patch is against the two "stable" previous ones.
