In addition to what others have mentioned, there's also the situation
where swap is on a logical volume. In that case, the initramfs needs to
get LVM up and running before you can even think about resuming.
Swap on a logical volume is the default Fedora Core 3 partition layout,
and I imagine it's the default for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as well.
