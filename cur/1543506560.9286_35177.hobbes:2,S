You know how on Unix we implement spawn as fork+exec?  Well, according
to Cygwin docs, they have to do the opposite: they implement fork as
spawn+exec!  Along with a lot of weird code glue between "parent" and
"child" to get the POSIX semantics right.  It's butt-ugly, no doubt.
Having read all that I understand why VMS used spawn to halfheartedly
emulate vfork+exec (the vfork just set a flag or something, the exec
did the spawn) and didn't [AFAIK] bother trying to implement a true
fork at all.
