Come to think of it, the following refinement may be preferable:
 o Use PCA DMA interface for managing all DMA buffers.
 o limit = min(~(dma_addr_t) 0, MAX_ADDR), where MAX_ADDR is the maximum
   address that can be reached by the controller (i.e.,
   0xffffffffffffffff for a truly 64-bit-capable PCI controller).
 o Call pci_set_dma_mask(dev, limit).
 o If limit > 0xffffffff, turn on DAC mode.
This "algorithm" should be correct for all PCI controllers.
