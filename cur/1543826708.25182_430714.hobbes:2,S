heh, I think I found the thread you are on about, including your 4kb 
zone.
For future reference, the memory present in zones should be the same 
before and after the patches. Spanned pages and holes will be different on 
x86_64 because I don't account the kernel image and memmap as holes. 
Spanned pages may be different on ia64 as I start nodes on the first real 
page frame, not pfn 0 there and end them at the last real pfn. However, 
present pages should be the same before and after the patch :)

I can't argue with that logic as it makes sense with the current 
uncertainties. I'll keep it rebased and resubmit later. In the meantime, 
I'll keep an eye out for issues in -mm that I can hit a kick or two.
