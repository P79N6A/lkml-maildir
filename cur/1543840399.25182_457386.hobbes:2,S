Sourcing the bc Kconfig from arch Kconfigs would seem to suggest that
resource management is only possible on a proper subset of archs. Since
this is not the case wouldn't it be better to source the bc Kconfig from
an arch-independent Kconfig (init/Kconfig for example)?

Also, thank you for CC'ing CKRM-Tech with your earlier posting of these
patches.

Yes, it can be difficult to keep track of all the email authors.

	CC'ing only the known-interested people wouldn't be better. If anything
I think it's harder for everyone than simply CC'ing a relevant mailing
list like LKML and CKRM-Tech in this case.
