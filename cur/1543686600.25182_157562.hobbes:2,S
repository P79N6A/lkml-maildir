Hi.
Havent had time to track this down but the ipaq.c driver seems to have a
problem since about 2.5.57 or so.
I get repeatable stiffing of 2.6.0-test3 if I place my toshiba e750 in
the cradle while ipaq.ko is loaded. if it isnt loaded the machine is
fine. Im using uhci-hcd.
the e750 needs ipaq.c too be modified btw. (its prod id is 0x0409 not
0406 as is the toshiba e740).
