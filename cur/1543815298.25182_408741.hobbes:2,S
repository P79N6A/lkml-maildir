Sorry, I was wrong.  After resume the image pages in the swap are visible as
free, because we allocate them after we have created the image (ie. the image
contains the system state in which these pages are free).
Well, this means I really don't know what happens and what causes the
slowdown.  It certainly is related to the aggressive prefetch hook in
swsusp_suspend().  [It seems to search the whole swap, but it doesn't
actually prefetch anything.  Strange.]

Basically, yes.  swsusp.c and snapshot.c contain common functions,
disk.c and swap.c contain the code used by the built-in swsusp only,
and user.c contains the userland interface.  If you want something to
be run by the built-in swsusp only, place it in disk.c.
Still in this particular case it won't matter, I'm afraid.
Greetings,
Rafael
