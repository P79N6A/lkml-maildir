Hi!
Has anyone managed to get the onboard sound on the Asus K7M to work with
linux?  I've tried the VIA82cxxx module, and i managed to get sound, but
it was SEVERELY distorted (unrecognizable), and OSS complained to syslog
about it not being a real SB16.
Asus' webpage has lots of information about the chipset on the k7m, and
here's what I can get linux to report:
/sbin/lspci shows:
00:04.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc.: Unknown
device 3058 (rev 21)
cat /proc/pci (snipped off a bit) shows:
  Bus  0, device   4, function  5:
    Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo
Super AC97/Audio] (rev 33).
      IRQ 9.
      I/O at 0xd800 [0xd8ff].
      I/O at 0xd400 [0xd403].
      I/O at 0xd000 [0xd003].
thanks for any help.  I am willing to help in getting the VIA driver
working if needed, but my experience in C/asm is VERY limited.
