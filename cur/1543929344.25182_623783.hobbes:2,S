I'm pretty sure I've seen responses from Ingo describing this multiple 
times in various threads.  Google should have them.
If I remember right, the default is to simply recalculate the task's 
position in the tree and reinsert it, and the alternate is to yield to 
everything currently runnable.

The new scheduler doesn't really have a concept of "timeslice".  This is 
one of the core problems with determining what to do on sched_yield().

The problem is where do we insert the task that is yielding?  CFS is 
based around a tree structure ordered by time.
The old scheduler was priority-based, so you could essentially yield to 
everyone of the same niceness level.
With the new scheduler, this would be possible, but would involve extra 
work tracking the position of the rightmost task at each priority level. 
  This additional overhead is what Ingo is trying to avoid.

sched_yield() isn't a great API.  It just says to delay the task, 
without specifying how long or what the task is waiting *for*.  Other 
constructs are much more useful because they give the scheduler more 
information with which to make a decision.
