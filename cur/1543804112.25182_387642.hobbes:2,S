Since we have the majority of existing bttv code in drivers/media/video, 
i was planning to move some existing dvb code into drivers/media/video. 
If we have alsa code also in the same place, we can have a consolidation 
of code, might be easier to go through the code, but that is my personal 
opinion, but having code related to one chip in one place might make it 
look better probably..
