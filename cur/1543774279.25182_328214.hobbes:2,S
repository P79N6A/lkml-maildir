Running -50-17 on the Xeon/HT box, now with the ICH5 USB controller
disabled in BIOS.
The strangely regular ~200us idle jumps for both CPUs went away.  Now I'm
seeing one CPU at a time disappear (often completely absent) in the 
traces, with a the maximum wakeup generally hitting between 150us and 
300us.  While compiling a kernel and running vlc (which would skip frames 
like mad, even with RR scheduling) I was able to get one trace of 2556us.
There's also BUG warnings for update_out_trace().  I'm not quite sure if 
the trace behavior I'm seeing is related to this bug, but judging by the 
behavior of vlc, I wouldn't bet on it.
Since the 2556us trace is quite large all the info is posted at:
