Running 2.5.66 (plus Ingo Molnar's sched-2.5.66-A2), and I don't seem
to see a growth in the task_struct slab after repeated forking:
$ grep task_struct /proc/slabinfo ; for i in $(seq 1000) ; do /bin/true ; done ; grep task_struct /proc/slabinfo
task_struct           79     80   1552   16   16    2 :   54   27
task_struct           79     80   1552   16   16    2 :   54   27
