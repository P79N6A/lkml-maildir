My patch for this, while a bit large, is simple enough it can be merged
after the freeze.  E.g., if rmap is merged this is just "more rmap work"
and sane.
I would bump this down to "After feature freeze..." although I see no
reason it cannot go in sooner (I just do not consider it a pre-freeze
item in terms of its impact).
> After feature freeze:
Easily 90% of this stuff should _not_ go in after the freeze.  It either
needs to make it in now or hold its breath until 2.7.
I would much prefer a rush of merges now and less "improper" merges
after the freeze.  In fact, I do not care much what we do now as long as
we treat the freeze as a freeze and work solely to stabilize stuff.
