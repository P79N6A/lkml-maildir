very strange backtrace:

i've once seen the 2.5 IDE code doing a schedule_timeout() from an IRQ
handler, but the above has to be something else. Could you hack sched.c to
print out the exact preemption count? It could be a preempt-count
underflow due to an unbalanced spin_unlock, or an inbalanced
preempt_enable. [or the IRQ code - but i doubt that, we'd have seen
problems much earlier if this was the case.]
Oleg, do you have CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK enabled? That should catch an
unbalanced spin_unlock().
Robert, i'd suggest to add some sort of debugging code for this anyway, if
preempt_count goes below 0, right now we do this:
 #define dec_preempt_count() \
 do { \
         preempt_count()--; \
 } while (0)
this should be something like:
 #if CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
 #define dec_preempt_count() \
 do { \
         if (!--preempt_count()) \
                 BUG(); \
 } while (0)
 #else
 #define dec_preempt_count() \
 do { \
         preempt_count()--; \
 } while (0)
 #endif
or introduce a separate debug config option, CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT - until
all code is converted. This should catch a bad preempt_enable where it
happens.
