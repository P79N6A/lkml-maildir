People don't test 2.6-rc releases because they know they are not 
"release candidate, with only bug fixes" releases, which is how the rest 
of the world interprets the phrase.
Making them official releases in the even/odd manner is what neilb 
implies.  You'll just be diminishing the value of releases.  A "real 
release" won't be a real release anymore.  You're just renaming the -rc 
that isn't really an -rc.
