I'm seeing a cpu distribution problem running this on my P4 box.
Scenario:
listening to music collection (mp3) via Amarok.  Enable Amarok
visualization gforce, and size such that X and gforce each use ~50% cpu.
Start rip/encode of new CD with grip/lame encoder.  Lame is set to use
both cpus, at nice 5.  Once the encoders start, they receive
considerable more cpu than nice 0 X/Gforce, taking ~120% and leaving the
remaining 80% for X/Gforce and Amarok (when it updates it's ~12k entry
database) to squabble over.
With 2.6.21-rc3,  X/Gforce maintain their ~50% cpu (remain smooth), and
the encoders (100%cpu bound) get whats left when Amarok isn't eating it.
I plunked the above patch into plain 2.6.21-rc3 and retested to
eliminate other mm tree differences, and it's repeatable.  The nice 5
cpu hogs always receive considerably more that the nice 0 sleepers.
