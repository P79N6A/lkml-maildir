See if this makes sense:
http://developer.novell.com/support/sample/tids/bs98au6h/nwerrors.txt
#define ERR_INSUFFICIENT_SPACE          0x8901  /* 001 */
#define NWE_INSUFFICIENT_SPACE          0x8901  /* 001 */
And can you, just in case, check if IPX is enabled? ncpfs can work with
tcp/ip as well and this can possibly be not related to IPX
