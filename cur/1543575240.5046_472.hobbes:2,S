Yes, and I believe that this is what's broken about the SCSI midlayer. The the
io_request_lock cannot be completely released in a SCSI HBA because the flags
for that save are way up the stack somewhere. This means that if you need to,
for example, sleep on something like loop coming up, you can spin_unlock_irq,
but you can't restore flags, so for the UP case, you just hang. To avoid this,
I'm having to build a kernel thread to handle all of this kind of stuff in a
separate context. What a PITA.
