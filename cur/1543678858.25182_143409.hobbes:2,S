Subject: [BK PATCH] More PCI fixes for 2.5.73
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here's some PCI fixes that are against the latest 2.5.73 bk tree.  They
fix some PCI domain issues in the core and acpi, a reference count bug
in the PCI Hotplug core, and a fix for a character driver I broke with
one of the older PCI reference count patches.
I've also added a "fake" pci hotplug driver that might be useful for
some people to test their PCI drivers with, if they don't have access to
any PCI hotplug hardware.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
