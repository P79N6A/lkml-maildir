I for one use i386 simply because I do not have any computer that would 
support 64bit. But when I'll see a 32/64bit question during
"make oldconfig" I'll also know what to answer.

Let's check who the "people" affected are:
Aunt Tillie isn't affected since she doesn't compile her own kernel.
People compiling kernels have to learn that the choice went from 
ARCH={i386,x86_64} to a Kconfig option. I'd say it's more consistent 
that the 32/64bit question is now handled the same way as the 
K6/K7/K8/... question. And there doesn't seem to be any "longer" or 
"more work" in this case.
What's left are kernel developers who have not read the toplevel README 
and who do therefore not know about KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG. Getting people to 
write documentation is a hard task, but it's only second to getting 
people to read documentation....
And although you might argue that you have a few characters more to type 
when using KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG it has the advantage that it's generic,
and it e.g. allows you to create a CONFIG_X86_32=y, CONFIG_SMP=n 
allyesconfig configuration.
