Strictly, I should say on 32-bit, EFI runtime service won't work in
kexeced kernel. That is, on EFI 32 platform, it is possible that:
- Boot kernel A with EFI runtime service
- kexec kernel B without EFI runtime service (such as with noefi in
kernel command line)
I suspect this method can be used on 32-bit platform. Because the
fixmap area on 32-bit is more limited than 64-bit. And because
identity map area on 32-bit is too limited, it is possible that all
EFI runtime code, data, IO areas need to be mapped via  fixmap.
