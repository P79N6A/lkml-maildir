Without answering your specific question, but addressing $subject, what 
problem is caused by the PCI device order you see?
You can use ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO to get the PCI bus info for an ethernet 
interface, so you know at all times what device is associated with what 
PCI device.  And among other ways you are notified of device 
addition/removal by the execution of /sbin/hotplug for each ethernet 
interface.
