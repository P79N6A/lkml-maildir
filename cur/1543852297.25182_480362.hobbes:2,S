Subject: [RFC PATCH 1/2] sys_syslog: check open permission for reading and getting unread count
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/8/99

The "read" (2) and "get unread count" (9) operations of sys_syslog() may
also be invoked through /proc/kmsg; however, /proc/kmsg also performs
security checks during open.  Perform the same security check when these
operations are invoked through the syslog system call.
Currently this does not change the behavior - for cap_syslog() and
dummy_syslog() the "read" and "get unread count" operations are
identical to "open", and selinux_syslog() maps all of them to
SYSTEM__SYSLOG_MOD.  The next patch will enable syslog read for normal
users, so that a process could open /proc/kmsg, then drop privileges and
continue reading kernel messages from the open file descriptor - then
the added check in sys_syslog() will catch attempts to read kernel
messages without having /proc/kmsg open.
