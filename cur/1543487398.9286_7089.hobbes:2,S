*IF* you are controlling nuclear power station, use relays. They are
less sensitive to radiation, and they do not contain programs. That is
big advantage, because everybody knows every program contains at least
one bug.

PS: I can not imagine running nuclear power plant on any os bigger
than few lines. rtlinux maybe can meat goals in speed limits, but I
don't believe _any_ system as big as linux is can meat goals with
stability neccessary for nuclear power plant control...
PPS: I've seen post-crash analysis software running on windows
95. Let's hope that nuclear power plant never crashes...
