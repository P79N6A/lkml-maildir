It is needed if thread was not in the ready_list but existed because of
some global flag. Current code does not use simultaneous exit and this
function is entered only when there are threads in the pool, so it
should be correct. But if called by several threads, it should be an
exit condition. I will put it into the loop termination check for the
completeness.
