I agree.

shrink_dcache_parent() has been added back to generic_shutdown_super in
-mm3 (just checked). With that being the case, I have only one concern
with your patch
wait_on_prunes() breaks out if sb->prunes == 0. What if shrink_dcache_parent()
now calls select_parent(). select_parent() could still find entries 
with d_count > 0 and skip them and shrink_dcache_memory() can still cause
the race condition to occur.
I think pushing wait_on_prunes() to after shrink_dcache_parent() will
most likely solve the race.

I'm extremely grateful that hundreds of you have taken time to read these
patches, and to detect and report errors that you've found.
Your comments have helped me improve enormously. But I must confess that
I'm also disappointed to have had absolutely no feedback so far on several of
the patches on which I worked hardest when I was preparing these patches.
Could it be that (1) you've said nothing about them because I somehow managed
to get the details perfect? Or is it that (2) you shy away and are busy, hence
you are unable to spend more than a few minutes on any particular topic?
Although I do like to think that readers like to provide feedback, I fear that
hypothesis (1) is far less likely than hypothesis (2).
