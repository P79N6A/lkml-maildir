The X driver already relies on EV_SYN to decide when it should act on
the data from the kernel. The problem is that the packet stream is
used as a time base for gesture decoding, because the touchpad was
designed like that to make driver implementation simpler. From the
Synaptics manual:
        (Specifically, the TouchPad begins sending packets when Z is 8
        or more.) The TouchPad also begins sending packets whenever
        any button is pressed or released. Once the TouchPad begins
        transmitting, it continues to send packets for one second
        after Z falls below 8 and the buttons stop changing. The
        TouchPad does this partly to allow host software to use the
        packet stream as a time base for gesture decoding, and also to
        minimize the impact if the system occasionally drops a packet.
For example, if I press the left button, the X driver can not
immediately generate a left button down event, because maybe I will
press the right button real soon, in which case the middle mouse
button emulation will be activated and generate a middle button down
event. This and similar things are easy to implement by just counting
packets.
I guess it would be possible to rewrite the driver so that it doesn't
rely on the packet stream for timing, but it would make the driver
more complicated.
If I could generate only EV_SYN events from the kernel without the
EV_MSC events, that would of course be OK too, but I don't know if
that is possible.
The event parsing code int the X driver currently looks like this:
static Bool
SynapticsParseEventData(LocalDevicePtr local, SynapticsPrivatePtr priv,
			struct SynapticsHwState *hw)
{
    struct input_event ev;
    while (SynapticsReadEvent(priv, &ev) == Success) {
	switch (ev.type) {
	case 0x00:			    /* SYN */
	    *hw = priv->hwState;
	    return Success;
	case 0x01:			    /* KEY */
	    switch (ev.code) {
	    case 0x110:			    /* BTN_LEFT */
		priv->hwState.left = (ev.value ? TRUE : FALSE);
		break;
	    case 0x111:			    /* BTN_RIGHT */
		priv->hwState.right = (ev.value ? TRUE : FALSE);
		break;
	    case 0x115:			    /* BTN_FORWARD */
		priv->hwState.up = (ev.value ? TRUE : FALSE);
		break;
	    case 0x116:			    /* BTN_BACK */
		priv->hwState.down = (ev.value ? TRUE : FALSE);
		break;
	    }
	    break;
	case 0x03:			    /* ABS */
	    switch (ev.code) {
	    case 0x00:			    /* ABS_X */
		priv->hwState.x = ev.value;
		break;
	    case 0x01:			    /* ABS_Y */
		priv->hwState.y = ev.value;
		break;
	    case 0x18:			    /* ABS_PRESSURE */
		priv->hwState.z = ev.value;
		break;
	    }
	    break;
	case 0x04:			    /* MSC */
	    switch (ev.code) {
	    case 0x02:			    /* MSC_GESTURE */
		priv->hwState.w = ev.value;
		break;
	    }
	    break;
	}
    }
    return !Success;
}
static Bool
SynapticsReadEvent(SynapticsPrivatePtr priv, struct input_event *ev)
{
    int i, c;
    unsigned char *pBuf, u;
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof(struct input_event); i++) {
	if ((c = XisbRead(priv->buffer)) < 0)
	    return !Success;
	u = (unsigned char)c;
	pBuf = (unsigned char *)ev;
	pBuf[i] = u;
    }
    return Success;
}
