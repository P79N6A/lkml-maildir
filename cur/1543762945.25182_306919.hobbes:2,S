I think the most people use hardware accelerated devices to
speed up theirs calculations - embedded world is the best example - 
applications that are written to use /dev/random
will work just too slow, so hardware vendors
place HW assistant chips to unload that very cpu-intencive work
from main CPU.
Without ability speed this up in kernel, we completely [ok, almost] 
loose all RNG advantages.
