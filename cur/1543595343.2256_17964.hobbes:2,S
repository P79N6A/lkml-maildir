As a start:
wait_queue_head_t	Now defined.
You can do '#if !defined(...)` and make code changes backwards compatible.
Macro, THIS_MODULE	is now the first member of struct file_operations.
Include <linux/init.h>	__init data type for one-time initialization code
			or data.
This is new, hense not backwards compatible.
Explicit initialization of spin-locks, SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED and/or
			spin_lock_init(spinlock_t *);
If you fix this, it's backwards compatible.
ioremap() and friends is now required even for low memory stuff.
You can no longer access this with a simple pointer, you must
use readl()/writel(), etc., for proper defererence. If you fix
this, it's backwards compatible.
These changes should get your module to compile (or nearly so).
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
