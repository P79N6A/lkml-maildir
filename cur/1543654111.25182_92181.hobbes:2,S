Oh, I realize that. What I do not see is the point of the typedefs AT
ALL. They must go. They are crap. They have no reason for their
existence.

That helps, by removing half of the reason why they are crap - the using
of types that are not architecture-safe in a generic ABI file. But the
other half of the reason is still there:
It doesn't remove the rest of the reason: that "__kernel_" prefix is
meaningless (since the type shouldn't be visible in a non-kernel
namespace ANYWAY, and that is the only reason for the prefix in the
first place). 
Basically, you have two cases:
 - you have types that are _truly_ generic 32-bit compatibility stuff,
   and are the same on all architectures that use this compatibility
   layer. 
   But if they are truly generic, they shouldn't need a new typedef AT
   ALL.  You should just realize that "loff_t" is always a "s64", and
   then just use s64 in the compatibility functions/structures. No need
   to make up some new typedef.
 - You have types (like the above) where the compatibility layer
   actually has _different_ types for different architectures. In which
   case they should be in an architecture-specific file, not in some
   generic file. And the name should not be "__kernel_xxxx_t32", but
   "compat32_xxxx_t" or something.
In _neither_ case is it valid to have a generic architecture-independent
file that makes up new types.  See? And THAT is why I thin kthe patch is
crud.
