The problem is that unlike CPU niceness, where you can literally rip the
CPU away from a hog and give it to some more deserving process, it's not
as easy to rip an active disk I/O away so somebody else can have it.
If the updatedb issues a seek/read combo to the disk, and your process gets
into the I/O queue even 200 nanoseconds later, it *still* has to wait for that
I/O to finish before it can start its seeks and reads.
For an extreme example, consider those IDE interfaces where fixating or
blanking a CD/RW will cause *all* the disks to lock up for the duration.
No matter how high your priority is, you *cant* get that I/O out the door
for the next 60-70 seconds unless you're willing to create a coaster.
