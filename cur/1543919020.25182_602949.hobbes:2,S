I want what we have for the rest of the kernel.  The ability to build
one kernel binary that can do everything and that is configured at
boot time or run time.
My perspective is that if we are going to have an in-kernel labeling
operation running that may be an unconditional function that can
only be enabled or disabled as the system runs.
I'm not after the kind of flexibility that allows us to do things late
in the game, at least not inherently.  I'm after things like being
able to have the checks separated from the labeling, roughly where
are today with iptables.
I'm really after refactoring the problem so that we don't get these
winner take all fights for use of the LSM.  If we can break things
up into small enough factors so that a solution does not all come
from one project then I think we have a chance of getting multiple
security module authors to work together.  Right now we don't seem
to have that kind of cross pollination when using the LSM.
But frankly even the ability to compile in all of the kernel security
modules at compile time and be able to switch between them with a
kernel command line option would be a start.

My perspective of the stacker module was that it's problem was it
did not change the problem into a more useable form.  That it didn't
dig deep enough to have useful consequences.  I don't think the goal
was bad.
In one sense what I'm proposing is putting the stacker functionality
into the LSM.  Allowing me to choose after I boot my kernel which of
the compiled in security modules I want to run, and ideally for each
logical kind of security test which order I call the security modules
in if I have more then one.

Communication error.  I can't do small pieces that are useful in an
upstreamable fashion.  That is the problem I see.  I don't care about
out of kernel code.  If we have to compile all of the code into the
kernel and have no exports to modules that is fine with me.
My question is how do we get more interesting functionality into the
kernel.  How do we get the generic kernel support simple and easy to
hack so it can be used by people who have unique unanticipated
problems.

Quite likely, or at least I expect that they are close.
I just think we should solve this at the LSM layer if it is at all
possible not in selinux.

What is the kernel compile option for that?
Or is LIDS yet another security module that hasn't made it upstream
because the way the problem is currently factored it is nearly
impossible to your code upstream?
