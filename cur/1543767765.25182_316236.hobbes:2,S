Actually, mem_read(), the read handler for the "mem" file, calls
may_ptrace_attach(), which makes exactly the same checks as ptrace_attach().
In fact, mem_read() makes these checks each time it is called, while if
you were to use ptrace() to read data, these checks would be made only
at PTRACE_ATTACH, and not at PTRACE_PEEKDATA.
The only security that mem_read() gets from checking whether the process
is tracing the child seems to be as an indicator that some checks have
been done in the past. But these are exactly the checks that are being done
again right after this tracing check.
I don't see how that's going to affect any race conditions.

This question isn't about requiring the child being traced by the reader
or not. I'm asking why the process that opens the "mem" file needs to be
the one that does the reading. There are no special checks being done
when the file is opened.
As for stopping the child process: if that's necessary, then it looks like
there's a race condition present as it is. Because as far as I can tell,
there's nothing preventing a process from sending a SIGCONT to the child
process while the mem_read() is going on.
Please CC me in replies again.
Cheers,
