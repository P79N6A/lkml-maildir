This part is fine.

I think Mark has probably mentioned the need to support CPUfreq drivers
with no struct device. I had a quick scan of the current in tree ARM
CPUfreq drivers and could not find one that uses struct device (someone
will now find one). 
I wonder if there is another way to approach this as I do agree that
passing NULL is probably not the best solution. Alternatives like
embedding struct device with the CPUfreq core or adding a regulator_get
API call for CPUfreq drivers all involve some work. Fwiw, I'd be happy
enough with the latter option.
Thanks
