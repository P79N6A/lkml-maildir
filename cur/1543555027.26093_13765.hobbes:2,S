Frank,
You must be looking at Oracle 8.0 docs. If you are looking to update a production
system we only support stable kernels.  Pre kernels  are not yet really stable and
therefore not supported.  (We had to draw the line somewhere.)
That said, we will look into O_DIRECT and kiovects.  We may be able to do some
performance testing on that.
Regards,
