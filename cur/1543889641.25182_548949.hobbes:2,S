Right. And if we had had the nice old /sbin/hotplug thing, it would all 
have worked fine - because it would just have done an execve(), and things 
would be happy.
But people screwed that up too, and now udevd is an undebuggable user 
thread. Shit happens. See my other email about why even user threads can 
probably not be frozen, and the whole freezer thing is misdesigned.
And I repeat: PowerPC had working and stable suspend five _years_ ago, 
without any of that freezing crud. We should rip it out.
