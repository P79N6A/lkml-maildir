Dump the eeprom and send us a copy, plus any and all information to the card,
system etc.. I realize that you need the patch to actually create it but the
danger is that people will start using it *without* troubleshooting the real
issue. In various systems the eeprom checksum failure is actually due to a
misconfigured powersavings feature and the checksum is really not bad at all, but
the card just reports random values.
In any case, this patch should not be merged. We often send it around to users to
debug their issue in case it involves eeproms, but merging it will just conceal
the real issue and all of a sudden a flood of people stop reporting *real* issues
to us.
for e100 the case is completely different: there are many boarded e100 chips out
there mostly on embedded devices where the embedded manufacturer just forgot to
even program the eeprom, and the device really does not care that much at all.
