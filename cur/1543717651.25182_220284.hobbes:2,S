Does not work for me. But looks like that's because I had to turn off 
ACPI processor module since 2.6.6 since it would hang my system. It could 
also be that the hang is caused by the powernow-k8. I will check that.

Sure if the ACPI table check works properly. But even with 2-state PST,
being able to change from 1800MHz to 800MHz on battery increases the 
battery life quite a bit. And it does not necessarily require ACPI :)
