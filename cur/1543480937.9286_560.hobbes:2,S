Hello Linuxers,
If you are using the bleeding edge of the kernel, you might be
interested in "timefix.tgz", a diff on top of Linux-2.2-pre7 (or also
2.1.132) that implements the equivalent stuff that went into Linux
2.0.32. Basically it should provide a working adjtimex (known as
ntp_{get,adj}time) in Linux 2.1/2.2). Maybe test it if you can...
