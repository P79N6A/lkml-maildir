Clark,
Could you make sure that your modules in the initrd that you use are the
ones created with the LATENCY_TRACE option.  After converting all the
modules into compiled in options, I successfully booted the kernel.  So
you might have an incompatibility with the modules in initrd, when you
turn on LATENCY_TRACE.
