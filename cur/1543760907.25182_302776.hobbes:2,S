I'm having some intermittent build problems on 2.6.11-bk10.  First of
all, doing a 'make -j8 O=... install' errors out not being able to find
a vmlinux:
$ make O=../mhp-build/i386-plain/ -j8 install
make[3]: *** No rule to make target `vmlinux', needed by
`arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin'.  Stop.
make[2]: *** [arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux] Error 2
make[1]: *** [install] Error 2
make: *** [install] Error 2
Also, I just ran menuconfig, changed an option, and did another 'make
install', and it went straight to the install script with no
compiling.  
Note that these are with O=, so it might be just a separate build tree
problem.
Any ideas?
