As said the save part isn't necessary.
This is a trace of the deadlock:
	irq 2 runs
	keyboard_interrupt
	irqs are been left enabled
	spin_lock()
	here irq 12 runs
	keyboard_interrupt
	here doesn't matter if irqs are enabled or disabled of course
	spin_lock() -> dealdock
Really if you really want to, you could remove the local irq disable by
replacing it with a disable_irq_nosync(other irq).  Something like this is safe
and obviously right. But I don't think the keyboard_interrupt is long enough to
justify playing with the irq controller [that in IA32 UP isn't memory mapped]
instead of using the fast in CPU core local cli, also the cli version allows
the other irq to be started in parallel to us in another CPU.
	keyboard_interrupt(irq, ...) {
		int other_irq;
		switch(irq) {
		case KEYBOARD_IRQ:
			other_irq = AUX_IRQ;
			break;
		case AUX_IRQ:
			other_irq = KEYBOARD_IRQ;
			break;
		default:
			panic("wrong irq");
		}
		disable_irq_nosync(other_irq);
		spin_lock();
		-- critical section --
		spin_unlock();
		enable_irq(other_irq);
	}
BTW, after reading the code some more it seems you could remove the irq disable
also if CONFIG_PSMOUSE is not defined. So you can probably also do:
	keyboard_interrupt(irq, ...) {
#ifdef CONFIG_PSMOUSE
		int other_irq;
		switch(irq) {
		case KEYBOARD_IRQ:
			other_irq = AUX_IRQ;
			break;
		case AUX_IRQ:
			other_irq = KEYBOARD_IRQ;
			break;
		default:
			panic("wrong irq");
		}
		disable_irq_nosync(other_irq);
#endif
		spin_lock();
		-- critical section --
		spin_unlock();
#ifdef CONFIG_PSMOUSE
		enable_irq(other_irq);
#endif
	}
Or the __cli version:
	keyboard_interrupt(irq, ...) {
#ifdef CONFIG_PSMOUSE
		__cli();
#endif
		spin_lock();
		-- critical section --
		spin_unlock();
#ifdef CONFIG_PSMOUSE
		__sti(); /* this wouldn't be necessary if 2.4.x would
			    honour SA_INTERRUPT for the shared irqs
			    as 2.2.x */
#endif
	}
