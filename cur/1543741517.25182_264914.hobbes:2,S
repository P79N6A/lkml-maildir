Ugh, why would _anyone_ design a laptop like that?  You have 4
perfectly good interrupts that you are not using at all.  Is it really
cheaper to put everything on the same irq?  Does this work better under
Windows or something?
AFAIK there is nothing you can do - any other irq that fires on 9 will
mask out all the others until it completes.
I am increasingly convinced that the vast majority of laptops are
horribly broken and completely unsuitable for low latency audio work.
