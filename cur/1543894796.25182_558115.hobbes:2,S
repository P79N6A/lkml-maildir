Linux maintainers will enforce \t "being"[1] 8, and will also enforce
the 80-column limit[2].
(Assuming maintainer != developer)
To [1]: There is actually no substance in how wide a tab is. The developer
may set a tab width of 4, the maintainer may have his tab width set to 12,
and the end user to 6. As far as I interpret CodingStyle, it reads:
	Use \ts for indent, spaces for align, and make sure your code
	fits into 80 columns when the tab width would be 8.
	(You can test that by adjusting your tab width temporarily)
To [2]: There's always code slipping in that disobeys this ;-)
