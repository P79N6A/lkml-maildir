Like he said, he (and most users in my experience) has little interest
in why something happens, and his only interest is in what to do to
fix it once it happens.
I have explained the precice meaning of the latter comment. In reply,
he pointed out to me that when an agent is using the computer, the
customer can also see the screen, and were any such expressions to
appear on the screen at such a time, it would be unlikely to enhance
the company's reputation much.
Since it happens to be an upmarket company, that matters to them, so
even if the relevant applications were available (which they're not),
they wouldn't convert to Linux if there was any possibility of
suchlike occurring.

I thought M$'s most popular form of error was of the "I'm fed up with
behaving, so I'm going to crash and upset you" variety...

So do most TECHNICAL minded people, but an operating system is not
just for the technically minded, but for the general public as well.

Personally, I'd prefer to see Linux move over to having any error call
a separate module to generate the actual error message, and leave that
module to sort out the precice wording thereof. That way, it could be
dealt with in a similar way to the keyboard map at the moment, with a
language-specific module being loaded as part of the kernel startup,
and all messages would then appear in the selected language.
Given this scenario, the following would be a reasonable base set of
languages:
	English
	Spanish
	BrothelSpeak
	Technobabble
However, when I proposed such a system some months back, and offered
to do the necessary, it was turned down by all concerned, apparently
on the basis of the loss of performancee that such a system was
claimed to inevitably suffer from.

Like you, I hate "Oops 00" and "Exception 0E at address..." type
messages, but I'm well aware that what suits one person doesn't suit
another, and in some contexts (such as the one quoted above), use of
profane language in even its mildest form is considered totally
unacceptable.

Only if every likely user agrees to the use of suchlike language.
Best wishes from Riley.
