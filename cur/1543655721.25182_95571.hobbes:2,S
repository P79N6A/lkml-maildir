At times, yes :(
I've not yet traced this fully, but it looks like it might be the RSCS
gateway in action - I'll try to get the relevant folks to look at it.
Unfortunately, there are several groups involved - AT&T handles the
exterior gateway servers, another group handles the Lotus gateways,
and I beleive a third does the ip->rscs(mainframe) gateway.

from that! Har har har!"
