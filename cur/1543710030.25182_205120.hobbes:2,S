Yes, it is really firmware.  It is loaded from disk as a block of data and 
passed to the card.  The system CPU doesn't execute anything out of the 
firmware, nor does the firmware know anything about the kernel.

It is our intention to support a/b/g WLAN with a driver for Linux, but details 
are being worked out so we have no dates or commitment at this time.
