I know.  The reason I split them up is to maintain consistency through
the way we lock vs unlock and enable vs disable interrupts.  Partly for
style, partly in case we ever decide to hook the different calls in a
different manner.
I do not see this in your patch, though ...

Ah yes, very good.  I was too busy noticing the optimization I _did_ put
in: not calling rq_unlock here as we can just leave interrupts disabled
on return...
Very good.

Excellent.
