Sure. It's IMHO good and working, modulo the tag being removed
on the master device (optional cloning or something, IIRC).

I wasn't aware of devices doing 3. Aren't we able to tell them
to receive all packets anyway (even unknown VLANs#)?

I'm not sure if we really want it. If needed we can disable
acceleration, can't we? While accelerated we can see the packets
(without tags) on logical devices.
However seeing unknown tags on master device (with tcpdump etc)
would certainly be useful.
