Commercial devices have been produced in the past with sensors (not
unlike an eeg) built into a headband. There've been hands-free mice,
keyboards, and joysticks..You may have seen the advertising for them in
computer magazines around 1981-1984-ish. The keyboard was almost
impossible to learn to use (but that was actually a strategic problem,
not a technological one. I know how to fix that). The mouse and joystick
conversions were quite good. Easy to learn to use (that is, about 2-3
days before you could get 'em to behave). I liked 'em so much I built
one myself once (a mouse - which I later sold to a disabled Mac user to
offset the disgusting (at the time) cost of off-the-shelf
high-sensitivity epidermal pickups). The spooky thing about these
gadgets is that there's a brief delay between you making a conscious
decision to take an action, and actually KNOWING that you've made the
decision (I mean being aware of it). It's eerie to have the mouse
double-click on an icon just as you become aware that that is what you
want to do.
For my money, a combined keyboard/mouse/joystick unit, with an IRDA link
in my top pocket, and voice-recognition can go jump in the lake. Who
needs it?
