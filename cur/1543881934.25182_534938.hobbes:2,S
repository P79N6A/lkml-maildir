yes.  I'm increasingly reluctant to merge things which have had no visible
review from any third party.  Nowadays I'll shove such patches into a
pending folder and will wait a day or three to see if anyone has any
feedback.  If they don't I have to either ignore the patches or review them
myself.
I expect (and hope) that more formal processes will come about here.  Perhaps
up to it-won't-be-merged-without-a-Reviewed-by:.
But that only applies to things which I merge.  There's heaps of stuff
coming in via the git trees which is obviously inadequately reviewed - look
at all the instances of open-coded kernel_thread() which were merged after
the kthread() API was introduced, for example.
And other basic stuff like "use mutexes, not semaphores":
box:/usr/src/25> grep '^+.*[    ]down[  ]*[(]' patches/git-*.patch | wc -l
32
Ever wonder where all those whitespace bugs are coming from?
box:/usr/src/25> grep '^+.*[    ]if[(]' patches/git-*.patch | wc -l
265
box:/usr/src/25> grep '^+.*[    ]while[(]' patches/git-*.patch | wc -l  
35
Code which use spaces where it should be using tabs?
box:/usr/src/25> grep '^+        ' patches/git-*.patch | wc -l
1346
Heaven knows how many more serious problems are being snuck into the tree
via this route.
What do we do?
