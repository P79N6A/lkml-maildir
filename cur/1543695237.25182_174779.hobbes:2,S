Correct.  2.4.22 had this same problem.

I have never had a kernel that has worked with this box as is.  The
2.4.22 kernel worked fine on the system before I replaced the
motherboard/CPU/RAM.  2.4.22 was compiled with Pentium optimizations for
a Pentium 100 on a 430FX chipset.  2.4.23-pre6 (now pre7) is compiled
with K6 optimizations for a K6 2 500 on a MVP3 chipset.  ACPI was
initially enabled on the 23-preX kernels, but disabled when Jeff
suggested it might have been the problem.  Both systems
used the same OS/harddrive/NICs.
