Hi all,
Back to 2.4... I've just released Linux 2.4.35-pre3.
We're getting closer to 2.4.35. It is in good shape, and the major
change I was most afraid of (e1000 driver update) works like a charm.
Kudos to intel people on this one !
I will still have to see whether the skge/sky2 drivers are stable
enough to be kept, or if we can either update them or if I'll have
to revert them. I've encountered some trouble with sky2 that I could
mostly fix by backporting other fixes, so I'll have to decide what to
do with it.
I'm observing a slight trend of updates from people in the embedded
world. I encourage those people to continue to propose their changes
so that we can judge whether they will be needed in 2.6 too. It's an
area where it is quite common to secretly keep fixes and drivers, so
whatever can be done to collect all the work already done on 2.4 is
worth it.
BTW, please note that the changes under my name below are not from me
but fixes that I had to backport from 2.6.
Regards,
Willy
