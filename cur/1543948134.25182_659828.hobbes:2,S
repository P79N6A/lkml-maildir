Hi!
Andrew is trying to get s2ram to work on Fedora:

...unfortunately, it does not ship s2ram by default, and does not even
carry its dependencies.
Is there some custom mechanism to get suspend-to-ram to work on
Fedora? If not, would it be possible to start shipping s2ram from
suspend.sf.net? 
(Unlike s2disk, this will not eat filesystems, I promise  :-).
