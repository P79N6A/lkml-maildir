Subject: 2.5.44 : move files from drivers/media/* ?

Hello all,
  There are video and radio drivers within
drivers/media/video and drivers/media/radio respectively.
Shouldn't those drivers move from drivers/media/video to drivers/video ? 
and same with radio (either a new directory or within an existing 
directory). It just seems that the drivers/media/ directory is unneeded. 
Thoughts?
Regards,
Frank
