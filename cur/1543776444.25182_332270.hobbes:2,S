Ah.  In that case, enum is a pretty tortured way to declare it, though it 
does have the practical advantages over define that have been mentioned 
because the syntax is more rigorous.
The proper way to do bitfield masks is usually C bit field declarations, 
but I understand that tradition works even more strongly against using 
those than against using enum to declare enumerated types.
>there is _nothing_ wrong with using defines for constants.
I disagree with that; I find practical and, more importantly, 
philosophical reasons not to use defines for constants.  I'm sure you've 
heard the arguments; I just didn't want to let that statement go 
uncontested.
