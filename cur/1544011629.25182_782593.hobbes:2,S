Since it seems that libata developers need more time to fully analyze
issues with ata_id_has_dword_io() and I don't want to delay this fix
because if it could you please modify the patch according to Sergei's
suggestion of removing id[ATA_ID_DWORD_IO] check altogether?
[ It is a safe thing to do since the old code has been enabling 32-bit
  I/O _unless_ the ATA-1 dword I/O bit for VU compatibility was set... ]
Thanks,
Bart
