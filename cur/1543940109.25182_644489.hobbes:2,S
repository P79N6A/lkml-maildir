But nouveau is much less stable than nv.  For testing purposes, go with
stable.
I'm not sure why it won't run his screen though.  I can use nv to run a
1920x1200 laptop LCD.  It *is* dog slow (although nouveau was not any
better with a NV17 / 440-Go -- render support for AA fonts seems to be
missing), but it does work.
