Note: I just did a swsusp and resume and here's the same data:
$ grep . /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/*
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/cooling_mode:<setting not supported>
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/cooling_mode:cooling mode: passive
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/polling_frequency:<polling disabled>
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/state:state:                   ok
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature:temperature:             60 C
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/trip_points:critical (S5):           88 C
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/trip_points:passive:                 81 C: tc1=4 tc2=3 tsp=100 devices=0xcf6c2338
And just leaving my system idle for a few minutes:
$ grep . /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature
temperature:             62 C
and a few more minutes:
temperature:             64 C
And a few more:
temperature:             66 C
right now after typing this:
temperature:             69 C
So this definitely shows somethings not letting the CPU rest.
