  Hello,
  cogito-0.17.4 was just released - bugfixes release on the latest
stable line of the Cogito user-friendly Git user interface.
  Just a few tiny bugfixes.  So, what's new?
  * Make cg-commit -p imply -e
  * Fix cg-commit -M with relative path called from a subdirectory
  * Be way more paranoid when failing to apply patches w/ cg-commit -p
  * Do not use type -P (bash31ism)
  * Make documentation build with `make` not being GNU make
  * When fetching, autofollow lightweight tags as well
  Happy hacking,
--
