Forget it, my brain finally got a clue ;) Though I don't like the
solution. Adding pm_step & pm_state to struct request or a ptr to
rq_pm_struct seem the way to go to me, though I'm not sure which
of these 2 solution is the best, struct request is already a can
of worms imho... ;) If we ever need more PM fields in there, then
the pointer may be the best solution, but right know, I can't think
of any reason to add more stuffs
