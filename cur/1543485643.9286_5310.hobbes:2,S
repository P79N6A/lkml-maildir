So far nobody has shown that there is any bug in the VJ compression
on the Linux side. It would very likely not only hurt ISDN sync ppp, 
but async PPP too (they share the same vj compression routines), and if
that was broken we would see tons of reports (which we don't). I 
would say that it is much more likely that the other end is to blame,
until proven otherwise.
