So I think we're agreed that we want some core function to fall back to 
different mask values, but yeah, making it take dma_get_required_mask into 
account would also be good.
Most drivers just do the fallback themselves, right?  So it makes sense to 
just update the current code to fallback, and update drivers wanting specific 
mask values to check afterwards.  I hate to inflict that kind of driver wide 
update on Michael though... :)
