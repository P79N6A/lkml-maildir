I agree.  It seems very ugly.  I looked at a few drivers which loop 1 or 2
jiffies, but to busy-loop for 1/10th of a second, or even 20 seconds
is terribly bad.  I took a look at the functions scb_rdcmd() and
scb_status() and they are only reading from an I/O port, so no chance
of sleeping/blocking, just busy waiting.
