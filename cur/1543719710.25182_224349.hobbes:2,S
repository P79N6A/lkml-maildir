To put my PCMCIA hat on, are you sure you should be registering with
a subsystem which can cause you to create tty devices before you've
registered with the tty subsystem?
Eg, what could happen if you register with PCMCIA, PCMCIA hands you
a card to drive and register a tty for, and you do all of that
_before_ you've registered with the tty subsystem?
