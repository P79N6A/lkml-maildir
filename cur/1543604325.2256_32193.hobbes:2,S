    I was under the same impression about the module licensing tagging.  I
had read that it was suppose to be for maintainability (.i.e. source
available so kernel gods can debug) and not to enforce ideological
conformity.  Now I read that anything not licensed under the GPL, including
BSD or simply public domain source code, will taint my kernel and modprobe
complains about non-GPL stuff including parport_pc which apparently did not
have a license.  Should I expect a Linux kernel KGB to show up next?
    Furthermore I have to agree with the previous poster.  Any module could
easily lie to MODULE_LICENSE about its licensing terms and that would not
make it's source automatically "free" and GPLable so I am now wondering if
this tainting mechanism is of any use at all.
    Just out of curiosity do all of these license tags in the modules take
up any permanent kernel memory, especially in a heavily modularize system?
