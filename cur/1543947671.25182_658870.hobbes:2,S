This sounds like a wonderful idea.  But I'm a little unhappy with
some of the rather cosmetic things in this patch:

These macros are rather ugly.  If you really want them please
	a) make them inlines and lowercase with a descriptive name
	b) introduce them in a separate patch before the first real
	   path in the series.

I think this is a bad name for this helper, arch_dup_task_struct
would be more descriptive.
But we actually have an arch hook for this kind of thing called
setup_thread_stack which is used by ia64 and m68k just a few lines
later, so it'd be better to look into having a single hook.
(And possibly rename it to arch_dup_task_struct because the name
is a lot more descriptive)

Also if you reference the save area so often it'd be better to just
have a local variable for it.  Much better readable.

this should be struct task_struct *alloc_task_struct(void)

This is quite butt ugly.  But then again it's fpemu, so there's
probably no point touching it until a bored janitor comes around.
