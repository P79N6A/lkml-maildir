I am trying to use Speak Freely for Voice over IP. Generally it does work
but I only have half duplex.
Now follow my questions:
I have an Aztech Sound Galaxy NX Pro (compatible with Sounblaster Pro
2.0), is there a full duplex driver available (can the HW even do it?)?
The normal OSS/free driver from 2.2.7 does not support full duplex.
Will full duplex work with a Soundblaster 32 PnP? (the source just
mentions the SB16 explicitly and I have no clue whether the 16 bit sound
part of the SB16 and the SB32 is identical).
I would love to hear that there is a possibility with OSS/free or the ALSA
sound system. But I would even be glad if the commercial OSS can do it
(but with my Aztech card it did not work).
Secondly if only the SB32 can do full duplex I would need to know whether
Speak Freely works for hosts behind Masquerading/NAT (if the standard
kernels support this/patches are available/a gateway is needed). The
reason is that only my computer equipped with the Aztech card is directly
connected to the Internet.
I hope this message is not too much off topic and wish to thank for all
helpful replies in advance.
Best Regards,
