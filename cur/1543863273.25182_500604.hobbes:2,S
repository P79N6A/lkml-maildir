I also have an Asus A8V motherboard that cannot boot a newer kernel
because the SATA controller does not come up properly. I have tried
kernels 2.6.19.2 and 2.6.20-rc5 with no luck. It looks like later
kernels don't recognize the proper IRQ of the device as compared to
the 2.6.18 boot logs.

Similar output as above.
Does any one have any ideas?
