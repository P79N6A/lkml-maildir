Real world example is nss_ldap / pam_ldap -- these needs open socket to 
ldap server.  That socket is cached. And because they can not trust that 
application does not have closed file description of them, they check it with 
getpeername + getsockname  (at least it did when I looked code on
some years ago.)   
( opening socket again includes using starttls and  authentication  .. so it is 
  quite some overhead )
