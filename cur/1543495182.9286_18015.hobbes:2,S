Subject: file locking over NFS in 2.2.7

elm and mutt fail when they use fcntl() to lock the mail spool file which
is mounted over NFS in our case (/var/spool/mail served by SunOS 4.1.3 and
mounted by Linux clients).  strace shows that after fcntl() the variable
errno is set to "No locks available". It worked when 2.0.36 kernel was
used. It also works from SunOS clients. 
On Linux side: kernel 2.2.7, latest userland nfsd, lockd is compiled into
the kernel.  A test program showed that Linux-Linux locking didn't work
either.
Can someone explain it or point to relevant information sources?
Thanks,
Pavel
