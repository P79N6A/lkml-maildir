no, AFAIK there is no performance counter support in the vanilla kernel,
but there is an NMI oopser. And even if there was performance counter
support, having a default NMI oopser on UP *is* a much higher priority.
and there is no forcing here. nmi_watchdog=0 on bootup and the NMI
watchdog is disabled. (right now this is not enforced for the APIC-NMI,
but thats a detail.)
