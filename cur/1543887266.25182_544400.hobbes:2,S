sensors.conf supposedly _is_ the the documentation ;)
Search for the following line in /etc/sensors.conf:
chip "via686a-*"
After this line, add:
set fan1_div 4
set fan2_div 4
Save, quit, run "sensors -s" (as root), that should do it.

Great, this is good news.
The 0 RPM reading isn't related to the problem you had, this is a
coincidence. 2657 RPM (which your other example shows) is the lowest fan
speed this chip can measure with a fan clock divider of 2, anything
slower is reported as 0 RPM. That's the reason why I suggested
switching the divider to 4.

The problem affects almost all hardware monitoring chips, so this is a
general advice. I've added a note about it on the lm-sensors website.
Alternatively though, you could have recompiled your kernel with
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y, then lm_sensors 2.10.1 would have worked
fine again. Sorry for not mentioning this before, this might have been
easier than upgrading lm_sensors.
