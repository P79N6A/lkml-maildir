This seems a bit off-topic for LKML, because you should *always* check 
user-space for memory leaks before blaming the kernel. A few things that 
can help you with your questions:
- the 'ps' utility, to see who eats the memory
- valgrind - an excellent tool for tracking down memory leaks (and other 
bugs, too). Comes with Fedora, but check the Web for a newer version.

Leo.
