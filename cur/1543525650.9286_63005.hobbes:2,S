The main reason that the drive guys are looking at stuff like this is 
margin.  Drive companies are more or less giving away their products,
the margins are very thin and the competition is very tough.  What the
drive guys would _LOVE_ is a way to add enough value that they can 
raise the cost.  I suspect that when these drives come out, they'll
be a hell of a lot more than the $300 I hope for.  They'll be around 
$1000 or so.  The company that comes out with them first will enjoy
a certain amount of success and then there will be competition and the
prices will get driven down. 
Even so, the HD guys are hoping that adding this sort of feature adds
enough value that the entire industy can support higher margins.  And I
personally think it will work.  A disk drive is a pretty worthless thing
by itself.  But a disk drive with Linux on it, plugged into a network,
spawns a whole new industry.  You can imagine self backing up, mirroring,
etc., drives.  All sorts of add on packages which cost a little more.
If the common man wants a web server that is backed up by Maxstor, they
can buy Apache/Pro from Maxstor for an extra $50.  That's essentially
free money for Maxstor if they can get enough volume.
I'm not positive that all this will work, but I am positive that the
drive guys want it to work.  They need some margins.  I don't blame 'em
a bit, I remember when a 200MB drive cost $500.  The drive guys seem to
be outpacing Moores law...
