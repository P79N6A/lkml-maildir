  Hello !
  I have encountered few troubles while compiling the 2.4.20-7 debian
(testing) version of teh Linux Kernel. I got one compiling error
ide-cd.h:440: error: long, short, signed or unsigned used invalidly for
`slot_tablelen'
  Which I corrected by commenting out "short"
        __u8 /*short*/ slot_tablelen;
  And during the linking
net/network.o(.text+0xd577): In function `rtnetlink_rcv':
: undefined reference to `rtnetlink_rcv_skb'
  which I corrected by commenting out the "inline" stuff in the file
net/core/rtnetlink.c line 397
/*extern __inline__*/ int rtnetlink_rcv_skb(struct sk_buff *skb)
  It looks like it does work, but I guess it is not normal ! Is there
actually anything to be done about this ?
