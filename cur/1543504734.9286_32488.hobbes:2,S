Hello, all...
I've been experiencing semi-random 2.2.x hangs for quite some time now,
and have been unable to resolve the situation, so I thought I'd ask
for some help..
I'm running SUSE 6.1: I've tried the default 2.2.7 kernel, 2.2.10,
2.2.10-ac12, 2.2.11-pre2, and I'm testing 2.2.11-pre4 at home right
now.  -pre4 has hung on me yet (just built it this morning before
work), but I suspect that it will.  All hangs exibit the following
behaviour which has me stumped.  During 'normal' use, they behave
wonderfully.  When I leave X idle, and xscreensaver kicks in, however,
is when I experience the hang.  Usually within several hours of being
idle, sometimes up to several days.  Every time that I've been able to
trap it, the screen hack running 'halo -root'.  I have reduced my hack
set down to a small set so that I can reproduce it more readily, but
it's still a somewhat wait-and-see process...
When it hangs, it hangs tight.  ALT-SysReq-xxx do nothing, caps lock
& num-lock are dead, etc.  The built it screen-blanking has been kicked
in, and I can't un-blank, so I don't know for certain that there's
nothing on the screen.  I can't find a way to disable this behaviour
easily...  Is there way to disable the screen blanking, so that I can
see if there's an oops report?
The same is stable as hell running RedHat 4.2 / 2.0.36, so I really
don't think that its a HW problem.
Yeah, I know that I could disable the problematic screen hack, but
getting the kernel fixed is the right thing to do.  How can I help in
this endeavor?  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.  Even a
RTFM would be great if you can point me at an FM that I haven't
already RTFM'ed.
Thanks in advance
- Nick
