I know that the pointer is NEEDED (from the compilers pov); what I don't
know is whether it has any ill side-effects to change it to a char [].
Most of this stuff is a version-string outputted at initialization time and
is not needed any more (afaik) but, as you noted, sometimes it could be
used by modules.
IIRC it doesn't matter if a symbol points to a pointer or an array - the
symbol is resolved either way.
BUT, if there is something that absolutly EXPECTS this as a pointer - is
this replaced in memory by insmod/modprobe on every occasion?
Well, just as well, I'll make a patch and post it.
