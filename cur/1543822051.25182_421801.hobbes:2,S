Subject: [PATCH 0/10] bulk cpu removal support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

CPU hotremove will migrate tasks and redirect interrupts off dead cpu.
To remove multiple CPUs, we should iteratively do single cpu removal.
If tasks and interrupts are migrated to a cpu which will be soon
removed, then we will trash tasks and interrupts again. The following
patches allow remove several cpus one time. It's fast and avoids
unnecessary repeated trash tasks and interrupts. This will help NUMA
style hardware removal and SMP suspend/resume. Comments and suggestions
are appreciated.
Thanks,
Shaohua
