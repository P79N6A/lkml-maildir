Hi Alan,
here is the fix, tested, it works fine. The only unsatisfactory thing is
that we do an extra if() on each iteration making misc_register()
typically a few instructions slower. I will think a few minutes on how to
make the old version work (i.e. I suspect it was just an incorrect walking
of the misc_list in ac8).
Regards,
Tigran
