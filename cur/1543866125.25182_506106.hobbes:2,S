Hi list,
I have a kernel image about 600 KB in size that I intend to program to
flash memory on my target board (hence size required in flash=600 KB).
1) But how do I determine the size of the RAM required to run that
image? (Since I believe the image will be uncompressed in RAM, plus
will also need some extra memory)? Can I determine this info from the
kernel image / System.map etc?
2) Also, is there any way to determine (accurately) the amount of RAM
eaten up by the kernel (plus modules), on a RUNNING system?
TIA,
Rick
