No. You propmt only one invalid assertion.
After you this prompt you continue to validate rules and you
will
maybe prompt for another invalid rules. But these invalid
rules
are generally infrequent.
Thus in my proposal the number of questions on the *worste*
case
are equal to your proposal (rm configuration an reconfigure it
again, the vi methods is not serious).

It is very unlikely to have constraint on string or on
integer.
But anyway, where is the problem?
You simple ask the new value of this symbol.

But how do you help such users? Telling them to use vi?
Broken configuration will always exist (with generally few
errors).
Surelly also you produce incorrect configuration. (You can
garantee
that configuration for CML2 for kernel 2.4.3 is fully
compatible
with rules you use for 2.4.4? and for the 2.5.x?
We make always error. But if you don't correct the behaviour
of
oldconfig we will tend not to correct CML2 rules, because it
can
broke our configuration (and we will prefer a incorrect but
working
configuration that a correct configuration (but that requires
a complete reconfiguration, or some luck with vi)

PS: I think you missundestood my previous email.
No autimatic recovery of broken configuration, but it is need
a 
usefull tool to produce a valid configuration from an (maybe)
invalid or old configuration. In a manual manner.
