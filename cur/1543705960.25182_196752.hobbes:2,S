So it does ;-/
Anyway, in both of those cases BUG() is gratitious.  What that code tries
to do is "if we decided to use one of the old modes, we'll need 3 ports;
otherwise we should claim 8".  So simple if() would be enough.  I'll send
a patch in a few.
It would be nice to have gcc understand that BUG() is a sink.  Oh, well...
