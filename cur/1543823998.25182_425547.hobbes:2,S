Subject: Re: [PATCH] HPT37x: read f_CNT saved by BIOS from port

    The undocumented register BIOS uses for saving f_CNT seems to only be
mapped to I/O space while all the other HPT3xx regs are dual-mapped. Looks
like another HighPoint's dirty trick.
    With this patch, the deadly kernel oops on the cards having the modern
HighPoint BIOSes is now at last gone!
