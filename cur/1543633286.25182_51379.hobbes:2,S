I know they don't; they've complained about it in the past.  However, this
_is_ mandated by POSIX so we can't really fix that (Turns out everyone
thinks POSIX locks are broken in a different way, so my definition of
sane locking semantics is very different from yours).

Looking at samba-2.2.4/source/locking/posix.c, it seems to me that samba
trusts the OS file locking so little that this change will have no effect.

if you're locking between threads, you should be using posix thread
mutexes, not file locks, IMO.  There's nothing in SUS v3 which says
you can do what you've described.
