Documentation targets:
  Linux kernel internal documentation in different formats:
  xmldocs (XML DocBook), psdocs (Postscript), pdfdocs (PDF)
  htmldocs (HTML), mandocs (man pages, use installmandocs to install)
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
and 'man 9 yield'
works for me.
or are you saying that you want large *.txt book-like generated files
instead of larger *.html etc?
