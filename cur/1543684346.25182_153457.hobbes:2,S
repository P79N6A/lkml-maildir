Oh I'd be okay with merging a change like this into (say) 2.6.3-pre1,
without it having had a run in 2.7.  We need to be able to do things like
that.
But right now we need to be fully focussed upon important features which
are late (cpumask_t, 64-bit dev_t, 4G+4G, etc) and upon stabilisation of the
current tree.
