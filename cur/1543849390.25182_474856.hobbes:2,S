Well that's the problem.  The issue only existed in the nForce2
reference BIOS (and maybe early in nForce3) but we still occasionally
see shipping customer BIOSes to this day that have this same bug for
nForce5 (like M2NPV referenced in this thread).
Probably what ASUS is doing in the M2NPV BIOS is copying the ACPI tables
from an earlier nForce2 product.
Probably what needs to happen is to make the HPET check more robust and
only return 1 if HPET is present and enabled.
