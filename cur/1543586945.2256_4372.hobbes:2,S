Okay, I misunderstood.	I'll take a look at doing this for 2.4.
First of all, parport_pc will need to export the equivalent of
register_serial (its equivalent is probably parport_pc_probe_port).
[It actually already does this (conditionally on parport_cs).]
drivers/parport/parport_serial.c sound okay, or is a different place
better?
