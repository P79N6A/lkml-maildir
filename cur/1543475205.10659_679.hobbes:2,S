Linus knows about this -- please wait for pre5, and if it is still
inconsistent then, bring it up again.

Do you have this line turned on:
    [ ] IP: firewall packet netlink device
If you do, then you and CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_NETLINK are fighting over
the value of this option.  I am working with Andi Kleen on this problem.
If you don't have CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_NETLINK turned on, please e-mail
me your .config file privately, and I will look at it.
