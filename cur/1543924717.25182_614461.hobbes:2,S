Yes; specifically, boot_params.hdr.hardware_subarch == 0 (as opposed to 
compile-time subarchitectures, like Voyager, which still boots the same 
way as far as I know.)
It would definitely be good to document what other values in this field 
changes, of course.

Specifically, with this bit set the decompression code won't touch the 
segment registers at all, and it's up to the caller to have all code and 
data segments set up with suitable descriptors.  The kernel will still 
try to install its own GDT when the kernel proper starts; this becomes a 
hardware_subarch issue.
