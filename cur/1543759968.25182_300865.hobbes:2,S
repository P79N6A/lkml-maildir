Subject: [PATCH][SELINUX] Fix selinux_setprocattr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/8/163

This patch against 2.6.11-mm2 changes the selinux_setprocattr hook function (which
handles writes to nodes in the /proc/pid/attr directory) to ignore an
optional terminating newline at the end of the value, and to handle a
value beginning with a newline or a null in the same manner as a zero
length value (clearing the attribute for the process and resetting it
to using the default policy behavior).  This change is to address the
divergence from POSIX in the existing API, as POSIX says that write(2)
with a zero count will return zero with no other effect, as well as to
simplify use of the API from scripts (although that isn't
recommended).  Please apply.
