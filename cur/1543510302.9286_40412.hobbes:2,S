grep CONFIG_ $(find . -type f -a -name '*.[chS]') |
        grep ':#if' |
        grep -v -F "$(grep ^CONFIG Documentation/Configure.help)" | 
        awk -F: '{print $2}' |
        sort -u
almost does what you want. But there are a lot of CONFIG_ #ifdef's that
never appear in the Configure.help file for i386, so this ends up
producing too much output. If you replaced "$(grep ^CONFIG
Documentation/Configure.help)" with some other way of generating a list,
one per line, of all the CONFIG_ options that you think *are* used, then
the output would be more useful. Also if you got the output down to a
managable amount, you'd probably want to remove the awk and the sort so
that you could see exactly where the problematic #ifdef's are.
