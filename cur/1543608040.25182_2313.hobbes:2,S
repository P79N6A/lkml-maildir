 Assuming the code is correct at one stage, what do you need detailed
debug data, for?

 There are 4MB systems out there, too.  Sizing the buffer dynamically is
probably OK.

 The MPS tables are tiny comparing to other stuff, I'm told.  Switching
them to KERN_DEBUG is a good idea at this stage; as is probably undefining
APIC_DEBUG.  Anyway, I'm told APIC debug messages are small comparing to
ones output by certain other subsystems.
