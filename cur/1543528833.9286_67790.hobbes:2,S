Normally, an FPU exception is reported as an exception to the CPU. Some old
ix86 boards did hardwire this also to IRQ 13. The kernel tests this on
bootup and therefore you see the 1. If you produce FPU excpetions normally,
you should see exception 16 instead, IIRC. However, as long as noe occured,
you won't see it vai /proc/interrupts.
I don't know how FPU exceptions on the AXP are reported ...
