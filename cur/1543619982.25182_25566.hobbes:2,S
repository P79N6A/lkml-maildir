I agree with this sentiment.  As far as the filebased interface implying 
it is self-contained/loaderless, we can just look at this thread as well 
as Linux history -- the boot sector in a Linux kernel is basically 
useless and doesn't even work on a lot of hardware today, yet people are 
still refusing to deprecate it "because it's so convenient"...
