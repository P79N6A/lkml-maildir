Please don't remove Linux-Kernel from the CC, I think this is an
important discussion.

POSIX and such include information about signal handling and the
user-mode environment for C programs, both of which are completely
irrelevant from the compiler's point of view, including libc stuff.

I don't see how this applies.  We're only talking about the Linux
kernel here, right?

Personally, I don't care what you feel like requiring for purely
in-kernel interfaces, but __{s,u}{8,16,32,64} must stay to avoid
namespace collisions with glibc in the kernel include files as used
by userspace.

This is kinda arguing semantics, but:
A particular set of software (linux+libc+gcc), running in a particular
translation environment (userspace) under particular control options
(Signals, nice values, etc), that performs translation of programs for
(emulating missing instructions), and supports execution of functions
(syscalls) in, a particular execution environment (also userspace).
Without the kernel userspace wouldn't have anything, because anything
syscall-related (which is basically everything) involves the kernel.
Heck, the kernel and its ABI is _more_ a part of the implementation
than glibc is!  I can write an assembly program that doesn't link to
or use libc, but without using syscalls I can do nothing whatsoever.
That's not to say that I _like_ the way things are set up, but it's not
practical to change them at the moment.
<Wishful Thinking>
It would be nice if GCC provided a set of __gcc_foo inline definitions
for all sorts of useful functions and types, including various types of
memory barriers, sized types, etc and other platform-related garbage
that it would be good to have in the same place.  Then the kernel and
glibc could both just assume that they are there and not worry nearly
as much about what platform you're on.

Uhh, how about:
	grep -rl __u32 . | egrep '[^:]+\.h:'
or:
	grep -rl __u32 . | egrep '[^:]+\.c:'
Both of those return a _LOT_ of stuff.

Which is why it reserves __ for use by the implementation so it can
play wherever it wants.

But when I write my framebuffer library, I do:
#include <linux/fb.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
And I expect it to work!  I want it to get the correct types, I
don't want it to clash with or require the libc types (My old
sources might redefine some stdint.h names, and I don't want it
to clash with my user-defined types.

But the _entire_ non _ namespace is reserved for anything user
programs want to do with it.  I think most of the kernel types in
the current headers use __kernel_, which is safe enough.

But in a world with more than one register size, you _must_ use them,
for example, the x86-64 code uses them to handle 32-bit backwards
compatibility, and the ppc64 code does likewise.  When a program
compiled as ppc32 gets run on my ppc64 box, the kernel understands
that anything pushed onto the stack as arguments is 32-bit, and must
use specifically sized types to handle that properly.
