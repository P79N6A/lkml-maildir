The host bridge should preserve the byte numbering, i.e. byte address
0 on the host side should access byte 0 on the PCI side, not byte 3.
In your example:

So we have byte[0] = 0x11, byte[1] = 0x71, byte[2] = 86, byte[3] =
0x80, right?  If we read individual bytes we will get the same results
on a little-endian or a big-endian platform.

On a little endian platform, pci_read_config_dword will return
0x80867111, since byte 0 is the least-significant byte.  Thus we have
vendor id = 0x7111 and device-id = 0x8086.
On a big-endian platform a 32-bit read will return 0x11718680 (since
byte 0 is the most significant byte), and pci_read_config_dword will
byte-swap that to 0x80867111.  Thus we once again have vendor id =
0x7111 and device-id = 0x8086.

You do in fact get the same effect because of the invariance of the
individual byte addresses.
Doesn't the fact that people have been successfully using PCI devices
in PowerPC machines since 1995 or 1996 suggest to you that it might be
your understanding that is faulty rather than the code? :)
