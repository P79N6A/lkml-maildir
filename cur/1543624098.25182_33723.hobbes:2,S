  Hi, Al. Looking 2.4.19-pre2 I came across this in init/do_mounts.c:
	sys_chdir("/dev");
	sys_unlink("root");
	sys_mknod("root", S_IFBLK|0600, kdev_t_to_nr(ROOT_DEV));
(line 354 onwards). This will have the effect of blowing away the
/dev/root symlink that is carefully created a few lines above. Is
there a reason you did this, rather than something like:
	sys_chdir("/dev");
	if (do_devfs)
		sys_mount("devfs", ".", "devfs", 0, NULL);
	else {
		sys_unlink("root");
		sys_mknod("root", S_IFBLK|0600, kdev_t_to_nr(ROOT_DEV));
	}
				Regards,
