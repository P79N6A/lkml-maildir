This indicated to me that you were still developing a test here and 
discovered some startling things.

Indeed remote frees are slightly slower in some situations. Dont really 
dispute that. I am just not sure that the TPC test is really suffering 
from that symptom. I thought for a long time that the tbench regression 
was due to a similar effect too until I got down to it.

AFAICT the last state was that you were tinkering around with a test.

Ignore it? That is pretty strange statement given that I helped you 
analyze the behavior of your test and understand what was going on the 
system.
