This my belief too - we looked into patenting a while back, and in general
you cannot patent something that is already public knowledge. Ie. if you
have already published information, one way or another, no patenting.
This certainly applies to hardware (of any kind) - whether the same
rule is applied to software - no idea - but it seems probable.
Also, our information originates at the EPO - the US regulations/laws
might be different.
