i've not added any new lock, i'm merely reusing the existing ->i_lock. 
So there's no data or code bloat whatsoever.
one doesnt need any measurements to tell that a global cacheline
dirtying for every (most of the time completely unrelated) open(WRITE)
will hurt workloads that do that, especially on NUMA systems. I'd not be
surprised if it showed up in dbench/netbench.
