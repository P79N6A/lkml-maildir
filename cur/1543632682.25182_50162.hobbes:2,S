I tried another small patch that was sent to me
yesterday by JeffN. I applied it on top of 
the recent 2.4.19-pre10. The hunk did not 
match up, so I just entered the line
with 0x24cb in it, into pci-pc.c. I also added
ide0=ata66 ide1=ata66 into my lilo.conf.
DMA worked. Xine played a DVD with no jerkiness.
As stated yesterday, Andre's patch also worked on
2.4.19-pre9ac3. I will eyeball Andre's patch after
work and see if I can get it to work with -pre10.
Thanks for the help!
Tony
