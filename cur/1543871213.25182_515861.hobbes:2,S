This was something I was concerned about, it's hard to avoid since it 
shouldn't be run when scheduled tasks are which leaves running it 
before those tasks run as the only other option. To do that you need 
some idea of how long it's going to take to run.
Mar  1 22:36:17 redrum [  639.147319] calc_load(1) jiffies=311500 count=0 [start]
Mar  1 22:36:17 redrum [  639.147331] calc_load... count=5000 [run]
Mar  1 22:36:17 redrum [  639.147336] calc_load... count=5000 [finish]
While I really doubt the accuracy of these timings using printk (they 
vary a lot only going as low as 4 + 4µs), it does show that 1ms is plenty 
of time and that it *could* be scheduled at 1 tick before the second even 
at HZ=1000.
Of course then you miss out on ever catching tasks scheduled with 
round_jiffies since they'd need to run for a full second to affect it.
Also, calc_load with NO_HZ only appears to run every time the system 
needed to wake up for something else (calc_load itself is already able 
to handle this appropriately), so this isn't as much of a problem as it 
might seem. Someone whose CPU only needs to be woken up every 5s (or 4.5s 
for a round_jiffies task) will find their load being higher than it 
should be - but the current version does that already. (Mine doesn't 
stay below 0.5 with NO_HZ because of this).

Since Eric Dumazet seems to have disappeared for now I really need 
other people to comment on this too. Although you shouldn't literally 
time travel ;) (Date: Tue, 1 Jan 2002 03:05:07 +0000).
