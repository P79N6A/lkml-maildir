Subject: [PATCH] O5int for interactivity
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/14/143

More interactivity work for audio and X smoothness. I have fixed all my test
 cases and need feedback about others to develop beyond this.
Changes
The idle code now gives just under interactive state based on the runtime
 instead of min_sleep_avg - minor startup speed improvement.
Tasks that drop their priority while running are now put to the end of the
 queue to continue their timeslice. Fixes a little flutter when tasks are
cpu hogs for short periods (eg mozilla).
Tasks that are complete cpu hogs are put on the expired array every time they
 run out of timeslice.
