As far as I'm aware that's just a consequence of the way linux does memory 
management. If we ignore highmem, virtual memory is simply +/- PAGE_OFFSET 
away from physical so allocating virtually contiguous pages that are _not_ 
physically contiguous requires mapping them somewhere (the vmalloc area) 
which is limited. Given that large number of threads _are_ the problem you 
wouldn't solve things -- you'd again be out of space, although now for a 
different reason.
