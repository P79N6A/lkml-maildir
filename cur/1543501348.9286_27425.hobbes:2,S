sys_times and accesses to the /proc fs report wrong time informations, if
not patched. I hope, I did not forget anything within my patch.
The factor of 4 was chosen, becaus it permits the Compiler to optimize the
division by to be replace by a right shift, so calling sys_times incurs less
overhead. Anyway, it should not matter too much.

I think with iPII hardware, you can go well above 1000 withouzt loosing too
much time. 
Basically, you loose more time with higher timer frequencies, because
* the scheduler is run more often (code which has to be executed)
* context switches due to the timer interrupt
* task switches as a consequence of scheduler runs
* useless cache contents after context switches
...
Advantages are probably:
* Smaller scheduling latencies
* Higher serial speeds possible without enlarging the buffer
* Better performance of multithreaded apps in presence of scheuler bugs
  (this was the case before 2.2.8)
