It's normal (and consistent with EPIA-M). The first UHCI USB (#0)
could get it, too (but it may be connected differently with IO-APIC,
I haven't checked).

That "INT_A/B/C/D" stuff depends on the point of view. In the BIOS
setup you can select some IRQs (which Linux could change anyway)
but it's a chipset-centric view (not very useful here).
Every PCI card have INT_A/B/C/D signals and they are (may be) remapped
on the riser card and on the motherboard.
