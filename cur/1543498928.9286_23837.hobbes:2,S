Subject: 2.3.6 boot-up memory allocation problem

Hardware: Pentium 200, 96MB RAM, AWE64 SoundBlaster
Software: RedHat 6.0 kernel 2.3.6
Problem:  On boot-up I get this msg:
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 44K freed
init: error in loading shared libraries: libutil.so.1: failed to map segment 
from shared object: Cannot allocate memory
After this it just stops where it is.  Nothing gets logged to 
/var/log/messages  Same system booted fine with 2.3.5 and lower.  kernel 
config is very vanilla... basically just added Firewalling support and 
modules for ppp and sound.  Hope this is useful.
~Tim
