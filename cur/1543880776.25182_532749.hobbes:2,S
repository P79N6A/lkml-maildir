It's now possible to QoS significant parts of the kernel since we now
have a deadline mechanism in place. In the original 2.4 kernel, TimeSys's
irq-thread allowed for the processing of skbuffs in a thread under a CPU
reservation run category which was use to provide QoS I believe. This
basic mechanish can now be generalized to many place in the kernel and
put it under scheduler control.
It's just a matter of who and when somebody is going take on this task.
