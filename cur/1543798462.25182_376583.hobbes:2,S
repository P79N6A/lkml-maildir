Just FYI, according to Dijkstra[1] V means "verhoog" which is dutch for
"increase". P means "prolaag" which isn't a dutch word, just something
Dijkstra invented. I guess he did that because "decrease" is "verlaag"
in dutch and that would give you the confusing V() and V()
operations...
Other explanations you see in dutch CS courses are "passeer" (pass),
"probeer" (try), "vrijgave" (unlock).
I do agree that Dijkstra should have used Prolaag() and Verhoog(), but
I guess those operations wouldn't have sticked in the english CS
literature.
