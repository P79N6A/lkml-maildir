Because you are using insmod. The guys who break into your computer probably 
are not in their own language "that lame".

TLB miss overhead for kernel modules is very very hard to measure, at least
on the x86 platform. It can be an issue in userspace as you address much
larger objects and in certain cases like scanning an element in an array
of objects hit a TLB reload each scan or two (think about vertical line draw
unaccelerated in X11)

If you are that worried just burn a new root file system on CD when you 
upgrade your firewall. At least I hope if you are going to pretend to be 
so secure that tar is a bad idea you have no writable file store on the
machine ?
