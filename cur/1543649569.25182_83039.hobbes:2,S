epoll has another benefit: it works with read() and write().  That
makes it easier to use with existing libraries like OpenSSL
without having to recode them to use aio_read() and aio_write().
Furthermore, epoll is nice because it delivers one-shot readiness change
notification (I used to think that was a drawback, but coding
nonblocking OpenSSL apps has convinced me otherwise).
I may be confused, but I suspect the async poll being proposed by
Ben only delivers absolute readiness, not changes in readiness.
I think epoll is worth having, even if Ben's AIO already handled
networking properly.
