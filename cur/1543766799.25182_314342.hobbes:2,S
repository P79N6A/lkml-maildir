Yes, you are right, sorry. I missed the fact that message is not injected
into callback queue. Hmm, might be useful if it was, for implementing
various kinds of in-kernel notifications.
Other thing to consider - even if there is explicit schedule on userspace->
kernelspace path there is no quarantee that connector thread will be
scheduled before userspace - userspace could be higher-priority bursty task.
Although this scenario it not likely I guess.
