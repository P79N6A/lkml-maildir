Yes and no.  Junio C. Hamano explained the same thing to me, but he ALSO
explained a trick that he uses.  He ALWAYS tells the kernel to do a resume.
Then the kernel detects sufficiently early if a resume is really possible or
not.
Hmm, I guess I still see that if we wait for the kernel to mount / and read
/etc/fstab to find where the swap partition is then it will already be too
late to try resuming from the image in the swap partition.  But
theoretically it must be possible, because a certain famous monopoly
software maker can resume from an image stored in a FILE after starting its
boot sequence.

Exactly the opposite.  Regular halt works.  For some reason I hadn't tested
regular halt under Linux on this particular machine before first writing the
above (many reboots and suspends but not plain shutdowns).  But I tested a
regular halt later and it powered down automatically.  Only swsusp refuses
to power it down.
