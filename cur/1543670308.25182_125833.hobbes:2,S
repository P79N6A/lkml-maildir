You are exactly right.
The video BIOS on a card often contains information that is found
-nowhere- else.  Not in the chip docs.  Not in a device driver.
Such information can and does vary from board-to-board, such as RAM
timings, while the chip remains unchanged.
You mention "windows drivers" above... even some Linux X drivers
depend on video BIOS.  The S3 Savage XFree86 driver, for example,
uses video BIOS quite heavily unless you tell it not to (or are on
a platform that prevents such).
WRT save and restore, it is certainly possible without video re-POST...
However, support such will require a monumental effort of testing and
debugging for each video board.  This monumental effort _will_ include
XFree86 hacking and possibly the additional of some save-n-restore
video drivers, if we do not wish to simply require CONFIG_FBDEV if
CONFIG_SUSPEND is set.
Video re-POST is simply a Real Life(tm) shortcut to that monumental effort.
