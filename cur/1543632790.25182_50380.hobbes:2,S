Kernel does not seek for modules to load in any way. Actually, in usual
installation there are tons of modules compiled an mostly unused. You
must put the insmod command (or better modprobe command) somewhere in
the init scripts. Since I expect your installation is RedHat (the kernel
version looks like a RedHat one), there should already be one a it
should be loading all modules listed in /etc/modules.conf (not sure abou
the exact name - I don't have RedHat).
