It has to be correct.  We do the following in a hell of a lot of places:
	pfn = pte_pfn(pte);
	if (pfn_valid(pfn)) {
		struct page *page = pfn_to_page(pfn);
		/* do something with page */
	}
basically this type of thing happens in any of the PTE manipulation
functions (eg, copy_page_range, zap_pte_range, etc.)
If pfn_valid is returning false positives, and you happen to mmap() an
area which gives false positives from a user space application, your
kernel will either oops or will corrupt RAM when that application exits.
I believe the comment in mmzone.h therefore is an opinion, and indicates
a concern for performance rather than correctness and stability.
