Dear All,
Inside sys_ptrace, the function get_task_struct is invoked after
retrieving the child's task srtuct pointer. Why is it done? I have
tracked down the code and noticed that it is in fact an increment
on the (page?) counter. Can you help me understand it? 
Is it necessary to call free_task_struct whenever its get counterpart
is called?
** arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c
>  read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
>  child = find_task_by_pid(pid);
>  if (child)
>              get_task_struct(child);
>  read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
Thanks in advance,
Fabiano
