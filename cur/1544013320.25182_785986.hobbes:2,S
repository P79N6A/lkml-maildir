A kernel without SMP doesn't solve the problem. It gives the same
output as before, except without the CPU notices. I also found out
that a "vanilla" 2.6.27 does have the same problem. A patched 2.6.27
kernel (by Gentoo Linux) doesn't have this problem. I attached that
patch, so you might see what the problem is now.
