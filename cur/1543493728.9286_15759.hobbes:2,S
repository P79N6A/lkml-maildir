I run kernel 2.0.36 on my masq box.  So far, I've about exhausted all
the other avenues for finding answers, so here goes...
There are certain sites which simply will not make it through the masq
box to my internal net.  I'm at a loss as to why, as most sites work
fine.  This is a problem with Netscape, Amaya, IE, Lynx, and Opera, so
I've discounted the possibility of a foobared browser (well, aside from
IE).  And it's only http which causes a problem.  ftp, irc, ssh,
telnet, all work fine.
From what I can see, headers come back just fine.  I can grab a header
every time with webgrab.  But the bodies don't make it through.
Note that all the problem sites work just fine if I browse them from
the masq box; it's only when I try them on the internal net that I
experience problems.  And since my workstations are where I browse
from, it is a fairly irritating problem.
Here's an example of tcpdump.  This is from when I first try to browse
the site.  The browser just sits there, waiting for a response.  I've
let it go overnight before, just sitting there waiting.
root:/root $ tcpdump -i ppp0 host cpwright.villagenet.com
tcpdump: listening on ppp0

Is there something in the kernel that starts dropping packets or
sommething?  What would cause something liike this to happen?
Aany ideas would be welcome.
