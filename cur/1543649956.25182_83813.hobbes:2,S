We also need to indicate other things here though, which is why
Matt Dobson implemented a more complete topology description
under driverfs. If you're really interested in that level of 
detail from userspace, you probably also want to know things 
like whether the evil twins share a TLB cache or L1/L2 cache.
I can't help feeling that's the more correct & complete solution
to the problem. His patches are in the latest -mm tree, and would
need some more work to be extended to hyperthreading, but that
seems like the better way (for 2.5 at least).
