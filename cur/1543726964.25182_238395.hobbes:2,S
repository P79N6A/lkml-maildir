Hi all,   
I'm writing a driver for a mouse.   
When a button is pressed, the driver must send a char to the keyboard buffer. 
So, mouse buttons must behave like keyboard keys.
I would like to know how to send a char to the keyboard buffer. Is it need to
use the outb() function?
Does anybody know how to do that?
Thanks!
Maikon.
