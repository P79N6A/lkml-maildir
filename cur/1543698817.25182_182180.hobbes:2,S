I've noted this at boot several times with 2.6.0-test11
Dec  4 23:59:21 e-d0uble kernel: ide-scsi is deprecated for cd burning! 
Use ide-cd and give dev=/dev/hdX as device
Removing the ide-cd bootparams: (I didn't try the patch)
Cdrecord 2.00.3 seems to like the sony-dru500a, denoted as 
--dev=/dev/hdc, I burned several disks this way.
crdao and growisofs don't like to parse /dev/hdc as an argumenet, but 
I'm sure these are easily fixed.
