I am using ubuntu gutsy.
Kernel details :
2.6.22-14-generic
Lan card details :
DFE-538TX 10/100 Ethernet Adapter
RTL8139 Ethernet chipset
While booting, if the LAN wire is not connected and I connect it
later, the network does not get activated.
If the LAN wire is connected during the boot process and I remove and
reconnect the wire later on - it works.
ps : sorry i dont know where to report bugs..
