This is correct.
mq_notify is a function from the posix message queue interface:
It allows user space to request that a notification should be sent if a 
new message is waiting in the message queue. There are two options for 
the notification: a signal or a callback that should be called in the 
context of a new thread.
Signals are trivial, but calling a function in the context of a new 
thread is tricky: the kernel can't create new user space threads.
Thus the kernel interface for mq_notify with sigev_notify==SIGEV_THREAD 
is an asynchroneous interface: the initial syscall just registers 
something and if a message arrives in the queue, then a notice is sent 
to user space. glibc must then create a SuS compatible interface on top 
of that.
The problem is how should I sent the information that a message is 
waiting to user space?

Correct, always only one process interested in the notification.

I'm looking for the simplest interface to send 32 byte cookies from 
kernel to user space. The final send must be non-blocking, setup can 
block. Someone recommended that I should look at netlink. 
netlink_unicast was nearly perfect, except that I had to split setup and 
sending into two functions.
