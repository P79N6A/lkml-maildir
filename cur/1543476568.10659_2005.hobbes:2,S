	Hello Carlos,  The statement below of always on block group 17
	would lead me to beleive that the HD has a weak spot at that
	location .  When you e2fsck that partition are you shutting down
	down or are you umounting it ?  If shutting down watch your screen
	output carefully & see if possibly that that partition is really
	being umounted ,  there was a rash of 'Not being umounted at
	shutdown' a few months back .  If you umount it and then e2fsck
	the drive and get the error repeatedly then I'd start suspecting
	the drive is having problems , I'd then recommend replacing it.
