It's not just about Linux.
Applications behave differently too from the way they were 15
years ago.
Some databases, eg. sleepycat's db, map the whole database in
memory.  Other databases, like MySQL and postgresql, rely on
the kernel's page cache to cache the most frequently accessed
data.
To make matters more interesting, memory sizes have increased
by a factor 1000, but disk seek times have only gotten 10 times
faster.  This means that simplistic memory management algorithms
can hurt performance a lot more than they could back then.
In short, I am not convinced that any of the simple tunable knobs
from the "good old days" will do much to actually help people
with modern workloads on modern computers.
