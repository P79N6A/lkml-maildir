Right, it's an unfortunate side effect of the command table.

You need to explain why you think that is so, since this is the core of
the argument. The only thing I can say is that perhaps SEND_KEY should
even be root only, since it has a fairly large scope. It's really a
device exclusive type situation, where is a user has exclusive access to
the device it would be ok to issue a SEND_KEY but otherwise not. It's
not clearly a read vs write thing. It's impossible to shoe-horn a more
complicated permission model on top of something as silly as read vs
write.

DVD_AUTH by-passes scsi_ioctl.c, so yes.

It's not my decisions. The problem is that it is policy, and it has to
be restrictive to be safe.
