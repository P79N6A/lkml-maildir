You seem to be making 2 controversial assertions:
1. pthread_mutex_unlock must cause an immediate reschedule if other
threads are blocked on the mutex, and 
2. if the unlocking thread immediately tries to relock the mutex,
another thread must get it first
I disagree with #1, which makes #2 irrelevant.  It would lead to
obviously incorrect behavior, pthread_mutex_unlock would no longer be an
RT safe operation for example.
Also consider a SCHED_FIFO policy - static priorities and the scheduler
always runs the highest priority runnable thread - under your
interpretation of POSIX a high priority thread unlocking a mutex would
require the scheduler to run a lower priority thread which violates
SCHED_FIFO semantics.
