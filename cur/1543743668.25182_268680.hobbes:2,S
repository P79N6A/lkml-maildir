This is nonsense: If so, I'd be commiting a crime each time I fire up emacs
on Solaris (linking (GPLed) emacs to (propietary) libc in RAM). [Yes, just
an example; haven't done so for the best part of 5 years now...]
Besides, Linus has _explicitly_ said that binary (closed source) modules
are OK (under certain conditions). And AFAIU there was legitimate
discussion wether this particular excemption was required at al.
