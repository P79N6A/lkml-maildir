Subject: PATCH: linux-2.5.29/drivers/block/rd.c did not work with new do_open()

Hi Linus,
	linux-2.5.28/drivers/block_dev.c has a new do_open that broke
initial ramdisk support, because it now requires devices that "manually"
set bdev->bd_openers to set bdev->bd_inode->i_size as well.  The
following single line patch, suggested by Russell King, fixes the
problem.
	There does not appear to be anyone acting as maintainer for
rd.c, so I posted to lkml yesterday to ask if anyone objected to my
submitting the patch to you, and I also emailed the message to Russell
King and Al Viro.  Nobody has complained.  I have been running the
patch for almost a day without problems.
	Please apply.  Thanks in advance.
