How many people are sitting on the sidelines waiting for guarantee that ide is 
not going to blow up on our filesystems and take our data with it. Guarantee 
that ide is working and not dangerous to our data, then I bet a lot more 
people will come back and bang on 2.5. 
I know this whole ide mess have taken me away from the devolemental series. 
And I bet a lot of others. 
My vote for reason to advance to v3.0 would be more based on our filesystems 
surport. .i.e. XFS and the latest Reiserfs and redoing our middle layer, 
.i.e. treating a cdrw as another drive instead of an ide-scsi device and 
ridding us of  /dev/[hs][dg][a=z] and replacing it with a lot saner 
replacement (I know this talked about it, don't know if it has been or will 
be implemented.)   Along with the changes others have mentioned, but I really 
can't judge those because I have not used 2.5 lately for reasons stated 
above.
