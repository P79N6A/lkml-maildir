yes, indeed my patch is bad if you have PAT enabled: conflicting cache 
attributes might be present. I'll go with your patch for now.
should we perhaps do UC by default for early_ioremap() as well? Normally 
those mappings are only temporary - but in case of a leak they might 
hang around in the pagetables and the CPU might stumble upon them. Also, 
should early_iounmap() do a wbinvd() [/clflush()] call as well, to be 
safe?
