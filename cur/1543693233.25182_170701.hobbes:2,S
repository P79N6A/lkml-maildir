I would hope that it is more because the grsecurity documentation 
suggests it is still a work in progress.  Perhaps its author might 
consider dividing his work up into smaller patches for Linus to consider.
The original poster was right that restricting ports below 1024 is an 
unclean hack, and a poor substitute for a better permissions model.  
Unfortunately it is an unclean hack in an area where it is difficult for 
society to achieve the decision needed for change.
