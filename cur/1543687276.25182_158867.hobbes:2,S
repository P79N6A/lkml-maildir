The box is UP with I/O-APIC, configured for !SMP, IO_APIC, !ACPI.
2.6.0-test3 worked fine, but 2.6.0-test3-bk7 panics and halts on
boot in arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c:setup_ioapic_ids_from_mpc():

BIOS bug, IO-APIC#0 ID 1 is already used!...
Kernel panic: Max APIC ID exceeded!
This happens because cpumask_t on UP implements "a set of CPUs"
as "a set is 0 or 1" (asm-generic/cpumask_up.h), while io_apic.c
actually wants "set of CPU (local APIC) and I/O-APIC IDs",
which obviously doesn't fit the "0 or 1" assumption.
As a quick-and-dirty test I changed linux/cpumask.h as follows
--- linux-2.6.0-test3-bk7/include/linux/cpumask.h.~1~	2003-08-19 23:48:50.000000000 +0200
+++ linux-2.6.0-test3-bk7/include/linux/cpumask.h	2003-08-20 00:07:17.000000000 +0200

 #if NR_CPUS > BITS_PER_LONG
 #include <asm-generic/cpumask_array.h>
 #else
Since NR_CPUS==1 this makes UP_IOAPIC use cpumask_arith.h,
which is what the code used before the cpumask_t conversion.
With this change, the box boots Ok again.
(I believe this is the correct thing to do, except having
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC in generic code isn't quite right.)
