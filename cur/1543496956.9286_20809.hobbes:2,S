My understanding was that current is always PAGE aligned, which means
that on an ix86 based system, it can only be guaranteed to be 4k
aligned, not 8k as per your comment.

It's possible that such a value could occur as a result of somebody
making a false assumption somewhere...perhaps an assumption similar to
the above?
Best wishes from Riley.
