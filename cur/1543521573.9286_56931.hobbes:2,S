You missed the point. In the mount() you DON'T HAVE ANY STRUCT FILE.
Period. There is _no_ mount() method and there is no sane fs-independent
semantics to associate with it. It applies _only_ to block devices and it
does precisely the same as ->open(). So once you've introduced it you are
(a) facing the lack of object and (b) just got a caller-visible flag
->is_block_device. Fine, but... what did you win? You still have to create
fake struct file, struct dentry and struct inode and you _already_ have
both the method and flag. You've just bloated the set of methods. Great
idea, that...

Per-fs part outweights any small changes in inode proper at least 30:1.
_That_ is the target for cleanup. And yes, I prefer to have readable VFS
code first. Minor cleanup of struct inode may go when the things will
become stable.
