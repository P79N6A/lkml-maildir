For those who missed the first episode: my x86_64 system goes into a mad
oops frenzy as soon as it tries to run init.  Having discovered
panic_on_oops, I can now actually read the system's complaint.  As it turns
out, the actual process and call chain is different every time.  The common
factors, however, are:
	General protection fault: 0000 [1]
	RIP: __switch_to+51
	Call trace ends with thread_return+0
Might that ring any bells with anybody, or suggest areas for further
investigation?
Thanks,
jon
