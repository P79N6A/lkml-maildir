The problem is that my server is already in production
mode. I'm running great portion of my business on it,
where there is very little tolerance for downtime.
Because the server is located in a remote datacenter,
every time it goes down it takes several hours to have
someone sent up there to manually reboot it for a hefty
emergency fee. So this bug has already cost me a lot of
money, and I'm worried that it will cost me a lot of my
clients as well if it persists.
Remote hands are rather expensive, so it will cost me
$100/hr to have someone runs memtest86 on my server
since I can't perform it remotely. I'll do it though
since that's your recommendation for the time being.
Hope it will not take more than an hour to run the
test, and hope it turns out as bad memory modules as
you expect because I hate to downgrade after all the
time and money I expended on the upgrade.
