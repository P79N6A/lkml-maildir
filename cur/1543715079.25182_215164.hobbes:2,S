  I just got a new Quickcam Zoom.  I compiled the pwc usb driver as a
module for my 2.6.5 kernel.  I also downloaded the latest pwcx driver
which patched in cleanly (
http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/release.html
).
When I run camstream the window locks up dead tight and I have to reboot
to get rid of the process.  When I run motion I get this:
pwc Frame buffer overflow (flen = 582, frame_total_size = 76812).
pwc Frame buffer overflow (flen = 582, frame_total_size = 76812).
pwc Frame buffer underflow (4 bytes); discarded.
pwc Frame buffer overflow (flen = 582, frame_total_size = 76812).
pwc Frame buffer overflow (flen = 582, frame_total_size = 76812).
Anyone have any ideas?
Robert
