This large a fraction of things don't currently compile.
And don't call me Shirley. 8-)
Seriously, you got unlucky, and seem to be hitting just about
every broken driver/filesystem there is in 2.5 right now.
If you take a look at bugzilla.kernel.org you'll see that
most of the compile errors noted there are those that you've
highlighted.
Things like Intermezzo don't affect a large proportion of users,
so remain broken for some time. The framebuffer changes in 2.5.51
fixed up a whole bunch of problems that had been lingering for
a while, but there's still a lot of drivers not converted over
to the new API.
Compile-time breakage is to be expected in 2.5.x. It's a hard-hat
area. You may have more luck with 2.5-ac.
