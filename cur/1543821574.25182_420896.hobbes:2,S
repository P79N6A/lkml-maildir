s/single file/single entity/ and this may be useful.  Your filesystem
exports a directory tree, which is nice and easily parsable.  The
problem is that it is a single resource for everyone.  If different
users could have their own views of this filesystem, each with a
private snapshot, many problems would be solved.
Spufs might have something similar already.  Istr something about
returning a directory fd and then using openat(2) and friends.
