Absolutely.  However, reworking the entire VFS to make absolutely sure
that there are no holes in the implementation, and auditing every suid
binary in the system to make sure that there are no security holes 
introduced by adding new and interesting types of file descriptors,
is a bit more work than adding a new inode-operating syscall.  :-)
O_NONE has been proposed before, but the devil is in the detail.
