This patch set looks good now.  I'm happy to give it a 
  Reviewed-by: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>
Two remaining issues that I would like to see address, but don't
necessarily need to be part of this set, are:
 1/ When the last nfsd thread dies, lockd should drop all locks, even
    if there are active nfs mounts.
    One approach might be:
      export nlmsvc_invalidate_all
      call it from nfsd_last_thread
      worry about how to change grace_period_expire.
 2/ get rid of svc_wake_up and ->b_daemon
    Maybe change b_daemon to b_rqstp and just call
	wake_up(&block->b_rqstp->rq_wait)
Thanks,
NeilBrown
