swap prefetch stores the data at the tail end of the lru list which means that 
even if you do want to use that ram for something else, the prefetched pages 
will be immediately dropped. Since the pages are still on backing store 
(swapspace) they will be droppped without any further I/O.

Even on 2GB ram at home, where I regularly move iso images around, compress 
large files with big window compression apps (like rzip), manipulate gimp 
images, print large colour photos in high resolution and so on, I hit swap 
regularly and do notice it being helpful. This is what normal desktop users 
do.

It can't help the updatedb scenario. Updatedb leaves the ram full and swap 
prefetch wants to cost as little as possible so it will never move anything 
out of ram in preference for the pages it wants to swap back in. The use once 
logic in the vm might if you're lucky help the next time you use the memory, 
but anything you used prior to updatedb is trashed beyond oblivion and this 
has nothing to do with swap prefetch.

They're not mutually exclusive. We will _always_ have a load that causes 
swapping. Whatever the resources available on a pc, an application will come 
along that outstrips it. The nature of normal desktops is they're always 
driven to this level.

I'm stuck developing code I'm having trouble proving it helps. Normal users 
find it helps and an artificial testcase shows it helps, but that is not 
enough, since the normal users will be tainted in their opinion, and the 
artificial testcase will always be artificial. My mistake of developing novel 
code in areas that were unquantifiable has been my undoing.  If it's 
unquantifiable, but "obvious" then it has a chance...(like most of what goes 
into mainline). Precious few of the patches that I keep in -ck belong to that 
group though. 
P.S. Sorry about being harsh in the last email Jos, I understood your 
frustration.
