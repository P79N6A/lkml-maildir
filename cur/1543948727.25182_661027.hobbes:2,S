Not much cleaner compared to what?  I think padding stuff is bound to be
somewhat complex.  It's a nasty thing in nature.  I think ->extra_len is
better than ->raw_data_len because ->extra_len only needs to be updated
where the dirty jobs are done and extra buffer areas are added.  Any
better suggestions?
Thanks.
