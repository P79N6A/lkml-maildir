   While I agree that 2.6 is looking better every day.  I've been 
running my desktop on it for sometime.  I'm not sure agree we should be 
forcing  people to use 2.6 simply to be able to read their hard drive.
   It's getting harder to find a newly released motherboard without 
onboard sata.  Not having  libata support means that anyone running 2.4 
unpatched will be unable to use such systems.
