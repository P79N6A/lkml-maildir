I agree.
If I had a mis-plugged cable, I can guess it with tcpdump.
Because I cannot see the packets. It means no such packets on the wire 100%.
But if I had a incorrect vlan configuration, it's hard to sure.
In a case both of mis-plugged and mis-configured situation, I cannot
see anything.
Moreover, if I am configuring a machine via vlan interface which is
mis-configured partially, I cannot disable vlan hw acceleration
feature.
Thanks.
