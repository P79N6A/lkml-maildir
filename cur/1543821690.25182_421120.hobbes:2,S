Wow.  The extra debug patch yields... exactly the same address that's
already being printed.
The real problem is that the stack-dump code prints the wrong symbol
name here.  I don't see any easy way to fix it other than to put some
filler at __sched_text_start so the first sched function has a unique
address.
