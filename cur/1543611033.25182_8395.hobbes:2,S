Answering self, this I tracked down to a reported problem with mkinitrd 
3.2.6 that shipped with RH 7.2. The original reporter states that 
putting a 'sync' before the 'umount ${LOSETUP}' does the trick. This I 
can verify...
But, he had problems with > 2.4.14, whereas I got 2.4.15 to work but 
failed starting at 15-pre1.
