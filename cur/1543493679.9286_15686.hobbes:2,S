I'm getting a lot of these messages (about 1-2 per day):
Apr 21 14:00:52 anjala kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 536932, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 Read (6) 12 e3 52 08 00
Apr 21 14:00:53 anjala kernel: SCSI host 0 abort (pid 536932) timed out - resetting
Apr 21 14:00:53 anjala kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
Apr 21 14:00:56 anjala kernel: (scsi0:0:0:0) Synchronous at 40.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
(btw, why is the pid so high? some occur with reasonable pid's too: 2000ish)
The numbers after the Read (6) are variable.
boot messages:
