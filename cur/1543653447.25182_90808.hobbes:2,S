It's not "in the balance". 2.4 is a stable kernel series. The problem is
that if you switch from one stable kernel series to another
(e.g. 2.2 -> 2.4) on a production machine you know that you have to
check whether everything works as before you upgrade your production
machines. This can take quite some time. Within a stable kernel series
everything that worked in earlier kernels within this series should work
in future kernels in this kernel series. Don't forget that e.g. a
fixed security problem might force people to do a quick upgrade of
production machines to the latest kernel in this series.
There's always the possibility that you apply patches or use one of the
many two-to-four-letter patches which might contain the patch you
need.
Note: I don't know the specific situation with the new ACPI code and
      whether it might be good to include it, my arguments are an
      answer to your "in the balance" argument.
