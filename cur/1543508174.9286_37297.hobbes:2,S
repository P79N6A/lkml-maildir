This is WRONG. VFAT (but NOT plain old MS-DOS FAT !!!) has three times as it
should be: Modification time (this is old good MS-DOS "modification time";
preserved by copy), Creation time (not preserved by copy) and "Last access
time" (date actual -- time is not stored; not preserved by copy). At least it
is on disk -- I'm not sure if Linux's VFAT driver supports them...

Why so ? Why not use existing three times ? Even if "Last access time" is not
time but date...
