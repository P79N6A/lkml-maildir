I am impressed: I had 2.6.20 running with ipw3945 + wpa_supplicant. I
installed the d80211 system and the new driver, rebooted, and you won't
believe it, I had network connection even with WEP encryption.
That was a big surprise for me that it worked out of the box without any
magic.
If you are interested in any dmesg/log output, please let me know.
Ahhh ... one thing: The LED on my Acer Laptop (TM3012) does not show up,
maybe because I have CONFIG_D80211_LEDS off?
Again, thanks a lot for the good work!
Norbert
