True, and it could to tricks like listing space used for undelete as "free"
in addition to dynamic garbage collection.
Though, with a daemon checking the dirs often, or using Daniel's idea of a
socket between unlink() in glibc and an undelete daemon could work quite
similairly.
Also, there wouldn't be any interaction with filesystem internals, and
userspace would probably work better with non-posix type filesystems (vfat,
hfs, etc) too.
IOW, there seems to be little gain to having an kernelspace solution.
