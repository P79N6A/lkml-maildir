It can't be turned off. It is a way of managing non-swappable kernel memory
and if you are in memory pressure, then you may not get 'ideal' buffers.
There are a couple things you *can* do, though; take a look at
Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt in the kernel source. In particular,
tcp_wmem and tcp_rmem. It's not a good idea to set min and max the
same, but if you make your default the 'ideal' and the min/max slightly
less/more you should get good results.
Also look at your settings in /proc/sys/net/core/[rw]mem_[max|default].
Here are a couple of tuning links I've found useful:
