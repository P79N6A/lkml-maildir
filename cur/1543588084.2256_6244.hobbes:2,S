I tested my systems to try to reproduce the recently reported SCSI
tape corruptions. I did not find any errors, the tape works OK.
Linux version 2.4.3 (olaf@bigred) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)) #1 Sat Mar 31 11:51:54 CEST 2001
K6-III-400, 96MB
NCR53C815 SCSI controller
HP C1533A DDS-2 tape drive
Tape drive compression turned off
These were the tests:
1. Copied (with "cp") and verified (with "cmp") two 650MB CD images
   from an NFS server.
2. In a  directory on an IDE disk:
   tar cSvf /dev/tape .
   tar df /dev/tape .
3. On the same disk, ~6.5GB directory:
   tar cSf - . | tarmill -F1500 -m8M -C6M zip 3 list >/dev/tape
   tarmill -m8M -C6M unzip  </dev/tape | tar df -
   (tarmill is a tar archive compression/encryption program, available
   from <URL:
http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/sw/>.
 It reads/writes in
   blocks the same size as tar, just in case this is relevant.)
Still have to test copying from a SCSI disk on the same bus as the
tape drive.
