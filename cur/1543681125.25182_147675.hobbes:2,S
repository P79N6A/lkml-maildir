Escape is more intuitively obvious though - I would expect the suspend
button to only start a suspend. And the idea of escape cancelling
anything is well in-grained in peoples' minds.
Of course the other advantage is that reading lid & button switches adds
more code (To implement and to configure - the functions of those keys
ought to be optional?)
