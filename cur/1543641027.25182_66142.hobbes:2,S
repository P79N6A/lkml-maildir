Could be anywhere, really.  A network interrupt doing GFP_ATOMIC
while kjournald is executing.  A radix-tree node allocation 
on the add-to-swap path perhaps.  (The swapout failure messages
aren't supposed to come out, but mempool_alloc() stomps on the
caller's setting of PF_NOWARN.)
Or:
mnm:/usr/src/25> grep -r GFP_ATOMIC drivers/scsi/*.c | wc -l
     89
