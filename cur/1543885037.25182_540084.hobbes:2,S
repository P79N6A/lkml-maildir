I think we should avoid using %fs and %gs (no use for them, anyway); but
 I think it's a decent expectation to have %cs, %ds, %es, and %ss set up.
Gujin seems to have a near-zero user community, so if they have to rev
their code it wouldn't be a big deal (the author keeps trying to push
some crack-smoking "Gujin native" patches into the kernel, too), but
breaking ELILO would hurt anyone using Intel Macs.
