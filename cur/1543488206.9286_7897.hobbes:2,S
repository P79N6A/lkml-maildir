D'oh. I've looked into FreeBSD implementation of AF_UNIX and it's, erm,
funny.
	* accept() doesn't return closed connections.
	* unp_gc() (their equivalent of unix_gc()) ignores listen queues
		* ... and is horribly bad in performance
	* connect() behaves as our one does.
	* unless they have a limit on amount of unp (== unix_socket)
	  somewhere else they are vulnerable to Andrea's DoS.
OpenBSD security logs:
	They've recently found a select()/accept() race (Feb 17). And
fixed it. We were lucky here. Their fix seems to be still vulnerable to
Andrea's DoS (modulo independent enforcement of unp limit). unp_gc()
ignores listen queues (inherited from 4.4BSD).
