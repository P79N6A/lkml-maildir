I have found the problem (thanks to Mitch). This is due to have NIS enabled in
nsswitch.conf. Without NIS, boot and shutdown is OK.
When I'm at home, all is OK, because I don't have a NIS server. But when I will
come back at work, I need NIS, so, if someone has a tip on how to also cover
this problem, you are welcome.
Let me know if I'm wrong, be it seem this is due to a change in the kernel
between 2.2 and 2.4.
Good day.
