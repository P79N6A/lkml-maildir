I've been wondering about this, and it is questionable whether we
should allow any serial port which isn't owned by the legacy platform
device (the one called "serial8250", iow by the 8250 driver itself)
to have the base addresses and interrupts changed.
IOW, we apply this "fixed port" to any port registered by probe
modules external to the 8250 driver itself, such as PCI, PNP, etc.
