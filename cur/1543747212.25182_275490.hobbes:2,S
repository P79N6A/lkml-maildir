I have always felt (pretty strongly) that the /usr/include/xxx contents 
should not be kernel-dependent, but be linked to your glibc version. 
That's why the symlink from /usr/include/xxx to /usr/src/linux/include/
has been deprecated for the last, oh about ten years now..
Yes, there are some _very_ specific things which might care about system 
calls or ioctl's that have been added later, but let's face it, we don't 
actually do that very often. The kernel may change at a rapid pace, but 
user interfaces don't, and user interfaces that would bypass the C library 
change even less frequently.
