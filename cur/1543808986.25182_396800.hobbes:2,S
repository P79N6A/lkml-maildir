Subject: Question: possible bug in setrlimit

A test suite uncovered a possible bug in setrlimit(2).
A code that does
        mylimits.rlim_cur = 0;
        setrlimit(RLIMIT_CPU, &mylimits);
does not set a cpu time limit.
No signal is sent to this code when its "limit" of 0 seconds expires.
Under the 2.6.5 kernel (SuSE SLESS9) a signal was sent.
I don't see any obvious difference in sys_setrlimit() or
set_process_cpu_timer() between 2.6.5 and 2.6.16.
Is a cpu time limit of 0 supposed to limit to 0 seconds, or be unlimited?
