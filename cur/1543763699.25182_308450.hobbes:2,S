Subject: AIM9 slowdowns between 2.6.11 and 2.6.12-rc1

While testing the page placement policy patches on 2.6.12-rc1, I noticed
that aim9 is showing significant slowdowns on page allocation-related
tests. An excerpt of the results is at the end of this mail but it shows
that page_test is allocating 18000 less pages.
I did not check who has been recently changing the buddy allocator but
they might want to run a benchmark or two to make sure this is not
something specific to my setup.
