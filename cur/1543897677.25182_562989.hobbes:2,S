It's (IMO) by far not the optimal "solution"  :)  If it is felt a
solution is really needed, re-introduction of a
security_ops->module_exit hook and introduction of CAP_SYS_CAPDISABLE
would be better.
But I'm well aware there are far too many (separate and not so separate)
agendas driving this, and have no expectations of being able to stop it.
James, FWIW, I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to actually test the
patch.  I'll try to get around to that today or at least this week.
