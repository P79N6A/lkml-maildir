(I said that because most things go in because they have uses, not just

And that benefit is...? :-)
I suppose it's for example a convenient way to test-build a kernel
without deprecated stuff, run the kernel, and see if anything in
userland breaks.  Then take measures to update userland in time, or get
in touch with whoever declared the deprecation, before it's too late.
You probably have more applications in mind and maybe even posted about
them before.  (See also at the end of this mail.)

Ah, I see.  (It gets better because you reduce redundancy of Kconfig
expressions vs. Kconfig display strings.)

Sorry, I didn't express myself clearly.  It's quite clear what the
labels mean.  But it can be controversial whether a piece of code
deserves one of these labels.  Except for BROKEN, whose applicability
can be proven or falsified.

The difference is that there will be even more tags which require
attention to keep them up to date.  Although that's hardly a problem if
there is an alert maintainer or janitor, or at least an enthusiastic
user who sends a notice to LKML.

It is sometimes true for years, although that's not the goal for
software in mainline.

Yep.

"maturity" is just like "depends on" with the added feature that UIs are
supposed to print the flag onto the screen even if the user did not
enable a debug mode of the UI.
It's really nothing more.  Nobody stops you for example from writing a
derivative of make allyesconfig which says N to CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.

Yes, they have different meanings.  No, they are not exclusive, they are
orthogonal.
DEPRECATED = "I don't want you to build or run this if you can possibly
avoid it."
OBSOLETE = "There is other stuff which does more or less the same, and
this here could go away in the future."

Aha, a tool to split and prioritize an integrator's efforts to unbreak
things.  It's another of the applications you could have mentioned to
show the benefits of the facility. :-)
