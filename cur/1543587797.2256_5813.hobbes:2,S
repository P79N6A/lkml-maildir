No, you just need a half dozen microphones. They get
tossed back to assistants on a least-recently-used basis.

This is a reason to have athletic assitants, and another
reason to have a half dozen microphones instead of just one.
Still, the post-conference mixing from dozens of overhead
microphones looks best. It adds cost, setup time, and
post-processing time, but is totally reliable and does not
interfere with the conference at all.
If you wanted to get fancy, multiple overhead microphones
ought to let you cancel any sort of background noise with
a bit of 3d audio processing. Sneezes, coughs, footsteps,
people falling out of their chairs... all processed out.
