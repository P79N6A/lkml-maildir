Just tested, and I confirm this too :
gcc -D_GNU_SOURCE -O2 -Wstrict-prototypes -Wall -g -I../include-glibc -I/usr/include/db3 -include ../include-glibc/glibc-bugs.h -I/
sr/src/linux/include -I../include -DRESOLVE_HOSTNAMES   -c -o ip.o ip.c
In file included from ../include-glibc/netinet/in.h:7,
                 from ip.c:23:

make: *** [all] Error 2
These fields are of type 'struct sockaddr_storage' :
struct group_source_req
{
        __u32                   gsr_interface;  /* interface index */
        struct sockaddr_storage gsr_group;      /* group address */
        struct sockaddr_storage gsr_source;     /* source address */
};
But sockaddr_storage is defined in socket.h within such a #if :
#if defined(__KERNEL__) || !defined(__GLIBC__) || (__GLIBC__ < 2)
So it is clear that compiling with such headers on a recent libc outside the
kernel may fail. I don't know what changed exactly, the #if or
sockaddr_storage declaration.
BTW, wouldn't it be interesting to have some sort of way to bypass these
checks when we know that we want to compile against kernel headers ? I
encountered the case for arptables a few weeks ago. I find it very dirty to
add -D__KERNEL__ to user-space makefiles, and I don't find it logical to rebuild
a libc with pre-release kernel headers either.
So perhaps something like this would be useful for a limited set of userspace
programs :
  #if defined(__KERNEL__) || defined(REALLY_USE_KHDR) || !defined(__GLIBC__)...
Then, the affected programs could simply add a '#define REALLY_USE_KHDR' line
before including particular headers.
Any ideas ?
Willy
