Why is that too fine grained?  You would just set the values from 1000 
to 255000 instead of 1 to 255, and round up.
I have a board that sets the time value in wierd times (like 225ms, 
450ms, 900ms, 1800ms, 3600ms, etc.).  I wouldn't be against the 
WDIOS_TIMEINMILLI option, but milliseconds should be good enough for anyone.
