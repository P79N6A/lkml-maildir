The big question is, of course: Can you do that?  Can you make a fs
shareable
the way you want it with only a 2-times slowdown?  That'd be interesting
to see.

Cool if it works, but then the next question is if you can make it
scaleable like that.  Will it really be 4x as fast with 4 nodes?
Maybe.  But it won't scale like that with more and more nodes,
that you can be sure of.  Sometime you max out the disk,
or the network connections, or the processing capacity of the
node controlling the shared device.  After that it don't
get any faster with more nodes.

No thanks.  It is the details that is the hard part here.

Try, but thousands of nodes sharing one or more devices isn't
easy to get right.  People struggle with clusters much smaller than
that.
