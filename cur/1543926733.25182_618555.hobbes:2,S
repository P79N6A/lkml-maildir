Patch looks fine (thanks for fixing it) but please replace the changelog
above with the proper patch description (more like in your first mail which
contained the description of the problem encountered and of the solution,
also please try to keep it within 80-columns limit) - for git history patch
changelog is not really that interesting/valuable.
PS patch summary ("Subject:") may also be improved while at it - it should
describe the main goal of the patch, also since patch will be applied to
the current git tree giving the kernel version is not necessary.
