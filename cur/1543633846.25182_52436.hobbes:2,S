	You are incorrect. If you have ten threads each waiting for an I/O and all 
ten I/Os are ready, then ten context switches are needed. If you have one 
thread waiting for ten I/Os, and then I/Os come ready, one context switch is 
needed.

	I'm not advising eliminating the threads approach. I'm only advising not 
using threads as your abstraction for clients or work to be done. Use threads 
as the execution vehicles that pick up work when there's work to be done. 
(Think thread pools, think separating I/O from computation.)

	Even if that's true, and it's often not, how many different types of data 
acquisition can you have? Ten? Twenty? That's a far cry from 300.
