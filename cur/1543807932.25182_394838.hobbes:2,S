I suspect the sshd on the firewall gets woken up for each line and it
behaves exactly like an xterm. After having done a lot of "ls -l|cat"
on 2.6, I'm not surprized at all :-/
A good test would be to strace sshd under 2.4 and 2.6. You could even
use strace -tt. Probably that you will see something like 1 ms between
two reads on 2.6 and nearly nothing between them in 2.4.
