OK I'll just drop this patch but can't we also use scatterlists in MMC?
The point is that I now think bio walking was a mistake and accessing
bios directly from low-level drivers is a layering violation (thus
all the added complexity). Moreover with fixed IDE PIO and without
bio walking code it should be possible to shrink struct request by
removing all "current" entries.
