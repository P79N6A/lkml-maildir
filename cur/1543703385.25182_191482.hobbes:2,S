When I first saw this thread I thought "yeah, that's a low limit", but
now I'm not so sure.  
The truth is, up until a few days ago when this thread started, I
wasn't even aware that there was a limit.[1] Which means, that for me
at least, I have never had the need to exceed the limit.  Because, if
I had I would have discovered what that limit was.
I'm not an "occasional dual-booting" Linux user, I've been using Linux
_exclusively_ since late 1996.  In that 7, going on 8 years I have
_never_ hit the limit.  Does that mean that it is high enough?  For
me, yes.  For others, I can't say.
Footnotes: 
[1]  Not quite true, I knew that there probably was some sort of
     limit, I just didn't know what it was.
