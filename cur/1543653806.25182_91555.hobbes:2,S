This is a FAQ by people who think a module is just some 'C' code that
you hack.
To use open/close/read/write files, you need a process context. You
can make one by creating a kernel thread. The kernel is some protected
code that performs tasks on behalf of the caller, in the context of
the caller. You can't call the kernel from within the kernel, i.e.,
sys-calls because you will never get back. It's like main() calling main()
in user-mode 'C'. And if you "know about swapping DS and ES", as you
state, then you know nothing and shouldn't get near kernel code.
If you need read or write from a device in the kernel, you just
read or write, just put your request in the queue for that device.
Of course if you really mean "files", then your module is broken by
design.
