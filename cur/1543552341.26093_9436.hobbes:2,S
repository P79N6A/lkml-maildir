Some of the stuff we do is hardly trivial. Could you explan what you
have found wrong with printk()? I have never had any problem with it.
If you are referring to the limited-size buffering of the output, this
is not something that requires a "fix". It is deliberate so that even
and out-of-memory situation can be displayed. Printk()'s buffer is
allocated once and is fixed-length. If you use printk for what it
is supposed to be used for, you will never have any problems.
There are other ways than printk() to write output to the current
task's output. printk() is most useful where there isn't a well-
defined 'current'.
static void print_string(char *str)
{
   struct tty_struct *tty = current->tty;
   (*tty->driver.write)(tty, 0, str, strlen(str));
   (*tty->driver.write)(tty, 0, "\r\n", 2);
}

Look, if you are doing product development, it's counter-productive to
use a __development__ kernel. You can spend too much time keeping up
with the changes. Instead, just like you should never change your tools
during a product design cycle, you should not change the effective
kernel you use. 
The "stable" kernel, i.e., 2.2.5 -> 2.2.17 has been kept up-to-date
as far as bug fixes are concerned. My drivers work fine in this
series.
At some later date, when the current development kernel becomes
the "stable" kernel, I will make whatever changes are necessary to
my (at last count) 12 drivers so they work in the new kernel.
This is something that will happen during the normal product lifetime,
not before the products are being shipped.

Not true. You can't have reviewed or understand any of the kernel code if
you believe this. All major elements are modular. When somebody comes
up with better memory management, it's encorporated, better scheduling,
it's encorporated, etc. This is what development kernels are for.
Bugs that were found when changing the design of various kernel
procedures, have been back-ported to the stable kernel series.
