Maybe the real answer is for someone to scope the sync signals and
work out whether the original or the patched version is correct.
Then someone's left with a buggy monitor (which, quote honestly
wouldn't surprise me in the least.)
If a buggy monitor is the problem, it might be an idea to introduce
generic "invert_vsync=1" and "invert_hsync=1" options to the kernel
(since a buggy monitor will affect _all_ cards, not just radeon)
