wow, now you again use big scary words like "breaking" and 
"frightening", with is a nice addition to the ticking timebomb 
metaphore.
Andi, sadly you are not listening AT ALL, you are repeating the same 
argument again and again that has been disputed and countered. Either 
come up with a new argument or please stop wasting everyone's time.
It is undisputable that for most users an unexplained hang is far more 
"frightening" than a hang followed by an explanation in the syslog. That 
is a _hard fact_, and if you cannot accept that it's really your 
cognitive problem not ours...
