in_interrupt() checks for both, hard- and softirqs.  Since
spin_lock_bh() disables softirq's you have to be as fast as possible to
avoid softirq latency.

Perhaps a call_rcu() which vfree()s the node?  But I am just guessing
wildly here.

That's basically a lacky in_irq().  The 256 you see here is
1<<SOFTIRQ_SHIFT but softirq disabling can be nested and you can not
check for 256 directly.

Can not judge that.
