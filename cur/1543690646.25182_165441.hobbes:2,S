Subject: 2.6.0-test5: "ifconfig down" loop on wireless interface

In my Dell laptop with a orinoco card (Dell True Mobile) ifconfig blocks 
while trying to bring down the wireless interface.  It doesn't give any 
error. ACPI is disabled, APM enabled.
It doesn't occur always, only if there was some traffic in the wireless 
interface. The process cannot be killed, but sending it kill -9 makes 
ifconfig to eat 100% of the CPU. ps axl shows the ifconfig process as 
"running", even before sending the signal. 
It's particularly annonying because the system cannot be halted properly.
-test4 doesn't suffer this problem.
Regards,
