Dear All!!
A core kernel developer  NEEDS to get these features straightened out properly 
in a clean fashion.  People WANT reiserfs integrated and working with LVM and 
RAID,  with good quota support.  These are 'Enterpise' level features.
It does not look like that much work is needed to fix the stuff the base kernel
and get better integration of these features.  The rough edges on them make us 
look like a bunch of amatuers.
Alan, will you look into it as a project???
Best Regards,
Matthew Grant
