Out of curiosity: Where does this limitation even come from? What
prevents kmap_atomic from adding slots dynamically?

Hm, alright. So I'm going take the internal of kmap_atomic into
scatterwalk.c. to test if the page is in highmem, with PageHighMem. If
it is, I'm going to kmap_atomic and mark the fixmap as used. If it's
not, I do the "mapping" on my own with page_address.
Btw folks: why are there UpperCamelCase functions in linux/page-flags.h
and you're whining about my camelcase style in gfmulseq.c? My file isn't
even intended to be included by other files, unlike this include file.

Ok, then relay on kmap_atomic, solely.
