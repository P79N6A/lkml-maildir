We have been using the #1395 adaptors from Ultraspec for years.  I just
received two yesterday to use with some old Suns.
As for monitors, I know that the ViewSonic 17GS will work; its horizontal
sync range is 30-69 hz, vertical is 50-160 hz.  That unit is out of 
production, but the current model GS771 should work as well.
The Acerview 99C also works, but I prefer Viewsonic...
