Hi!
Very clever. Invent new naming scheme of patches every couple of
weeks, so that as many people as possible damage their trees.
All other patches are called patch-VERSION. This one has to be called
prerelease-to-final. And applying it over test12 if you missed the
fact -prerelease exists (like I did) has some pretty fatal
effect. Why can't you stick with 3 version numbers, Linus?
