Well, I wasn't combining code that wasn't already combined :)
Just moving code that was referenced by another arch to a common
directory that showed the code is shared.
So, I moved a total of 44 files that were shared. Some of these were in
places where a full directory was shared (the mtrr code). And this
doesn't count the Makefiles and Kconfig files that were also modified.
There were only three files with the 
#include "../../<arch>/<path-to-file>" code.
These three where early_printk.c, tsc_sync.c and msr-on-cpu.c.
The rest is referenced by the Makefiles. This still doesn't make it easy
to find functions via TAGS or search scripts.
If you looked at the 18/18 patch, it has a list of the moved files, with
the exception of the speedstep-lib.h, which was moved in it's own file,
and those that referenced that header.

Does the Linux code tree already support sym links? IOW, are there
already sym links in the code tree? (/me probably should just look ;)
So should we have an effort to label the shared code that's already
shared.  As Andi stated, he doesn't like "large scale" renaming since
that doesn't "fix a single bug", and will only "just cause pain".
Although I disagree if in the long run it will make it easier to work
with.  Once one knows about the crazy linking going on then it's not
much of a problem, but what about all those that will have to go through
this learning curve.
The problem I have with the current approach is that it just isn't
clean.  Yes it "works", but it still is a hack.  And if I do need to
write code that will be shared among the two archs (still don't know for
sure if this will be the case), I would like to have a clean method in
doing it.  I don't care what the final solution is, as long as it is
clean and not a hack.
