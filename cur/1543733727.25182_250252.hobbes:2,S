Some semantics questions I have thinking about it from the I2O and
aacraid side: You talk about it as a barrier. Can other I/O cross the
cache flush ? In other words if I issue a flush_cache and continue doing
I/O the flush will finish when the I/O outstanding at that time has
completed but other I/O may get scheduled to disk first.
Secondly what are the intended semantics for a flush error ?
