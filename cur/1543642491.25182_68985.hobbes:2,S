  My machine is not exactly an 8500r.  It's an Intel pre-release
engineering sample (8-way 900MHz PIII) box that is similar to an 
8500r... there are some differences when going across the choerency 
filter (the bus that ties the two 4-way "halves" of the machine 
together).  Bill Hartner has a test program that illustrates the 
differences-- but more on that later.
  I've got 4 PCI busses, two 33 MHz, and two 66MHz, all 64-bit.
I'm configured as follows:
  PCI Bus 0     eth1 ---  3 clients
   33 MHz       eth2 ---  Not in use
  PCI Bus 1     eth3 ---  2 clients
   33 MHz       eth4 ---  Not in use
  PCI Bus 3     eth5 ---  6 clients
   66 MHz       eth6 ---  Not in use
  PCI Bus 4     eth7 ---  6 clients
   66 MHz       eth8 ---  Not in use

  2900 simultaneous connections, each at ~320 kbps translates to
928000 kbps, which is slightly less than the full bandwidth of a 
single e1000.  We're spreading that over 4 adapters, and 4 busses.
