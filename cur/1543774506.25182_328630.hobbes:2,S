Hello world!
Dave, please consider this patch.
I'm a newbie so I'm sure I've done a lot of mistakes starting with the
ugly name :)
Sorry in advance.
'condemand' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor.
The governor does a periodic polling and 
changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.
The support for this governor depends on CPU capability to
do fast frequency switching (i.e, very low latency frequency
transitions). 
This driver takes inspiration (and code) from the ondemand and
conservative governors, it does fast scale down like ondemand
and gradual scale up like conservative.
