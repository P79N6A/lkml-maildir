Isn't "blinking" a kind of policy, as is brightness (== duty cycle of
a high speed toggling)?  What if someone wants synchronised toggling?
I still think anything over a very simple interface being exported to
userspace is completely overkill and completely bloated.  Hell, I got
laughed at for creating an abstracted LEDs interface in the first
place because many thought the current version was far too bloated.
I _know_ people have issues with the current interface, whinging that
"it only exports the colour" but that's something which is actually
very trivially solvable and therefore _not_ a major problem to solve.
