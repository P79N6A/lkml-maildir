It reduces readability, IMO. Possible example: you missed two instances of
awk (lines 16, 33).
If you're aiming to be bulletproof, then you should also go ahead and use
backslashes on the echo and cat commands - even echo can be aliased into
something nonfunctional if you're insane enough. :)
Finally, it would be a good idea to add a comment at the top explaining why
the backslashes are there. (I meant to do this in my first patch, but forgot.)

I have included a patch below, against Riley Williams' new ver_linux, that
includes all of the aforementioned changes, in case anyone's interested...

"sh ver_linux" works fine with the current permissions.
