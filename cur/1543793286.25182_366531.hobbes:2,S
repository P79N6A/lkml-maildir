Following a crash last night (suspect buggy Dell BIOS, since upgraded), I'm 
now seeing thousands of: 
ReiserFS: dm-5: warning: clm-2200: last commit 2158066944, current 2158066945
ReiserFS: dm-5: warning: clm-2201: last flush 2158065946, current 2158065947
This is on both 2.6.12.5 (last night) and 2.4.14.1 as of tonight.  fsck 
reports no corruption and I have no reason other than these warnings to 
believe there is any, but this is (obviously) troubling nonetheless.  The 
relevant code is in fs/reiserfs/journal.c.  
For the flush case: 
        if (journal->j_last_flush_id != 0 &&
            (jl->j_trans_id - journal->j_last_flush_id) != 1) {
                reiserfs_warning(s, "clm-2201: last flush %lu, current %lu",
                                 journal->j_last_flush_id, jl->j_trans_id);
        }
And for the commit case:
        if (journal->j_last_commit_id != 0 &&
            (jl->j_trans_id - journal->j_last_commit_id) != 1) {
                reiserfs_warning(s, "clm-2200: last commit %lu, current %lu",
                                 journal->j_last_commit_id, jl->j_trans_id);
        }
The filesystem is mounted notail, no options with the journal.   Any hints as 
to what's up?  Should I expect corruption here?
