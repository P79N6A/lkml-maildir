Yeah, I did (in a plain text console) :
export DISPLAY=:0.0 ; sleep 3 ; eclipse
then switched to tty0 and got the following - written down by hand so
I left out some bits, hope I got the important bits - a few things may

If needed this is completely repproducible, so in a pinch I could
reboot with a higher fb resolution + write down every little bit by
hand, but I hope the following is enough :
