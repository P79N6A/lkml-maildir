Hi,
I'm currently looking at a possibility to synchronize the
filesystems of two Linux machines in realtime. It would
make clustering of web, mail and other services very easy
and reliable.
I've been looking into the omirr patch, but it's only
available for 2.0 kernels -- unless anybody has a newer
version of omirr or a better alternative...   <hint>
Anyone?  Or should I try and port omirr myself?
