That would be a false positive then.
In Martin's case he's 100% out of swapspace and has only a few tens of
pages letf mapped into pagetables, so Iassume that all memory is unmapped
swapcache (but that cannot be confirmed from the info which we have).  But
it looks like a real oom.
That's not to say that we don't have omm-killer problems.

What's the testcase?
