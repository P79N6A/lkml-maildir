  include/linux/skbuff.h shows skb->csum as an unsigned it however it's
irrevelant to my point. If the only time I see bad checksums is when
the skb->h.raw == skb->data and where the final byte is 0xb0 then
perhaps somewhere we are miscalculating something. This is providing
that tcp_v4_rcv() is called for every packet which is what I was trying
to determine.
