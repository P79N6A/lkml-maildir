Hi everyone,
I have just released a second bluesmoke patch:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/bluesmoke-2.4.0-test11-pre5-2.diff
This implements support for MCE on chips which don't support MCA (in
addition to enabling MCA for non-Intel chips, like Athlon, which
supports MCA.)
I would appreciate it if people who have chips with MCE but no MCA --
this includes older AMD chips and some Cyrix chips at the very least
-- would please be so kind and try this out.
