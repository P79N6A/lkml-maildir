The pyk code is for PICkit 2 and include the PICKit 2 bootloader.
it is an HID device so it is different from PICDEM FS-USB but you
might be able to reuse part of the codes.
By the way, there is another perl based code for the bootloader.
Just in case you are interested. Again I do not know perl and I
am not so sure if it is good enough for you.

Thinking about it, if the Linux USB maintainers agree to include your
driver, I have no objections. It should not affect the existing libusb
based applications and the users have one more choices.
