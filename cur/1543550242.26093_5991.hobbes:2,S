It's really absurd to attack Lehmann but I understand that's
your job.
RedHat workers should accept that they working for a company
that works against the community. This does not mean that
each individual worker works against the community but this
fact is not really important.
That's simply a fact that you can't discuss away by attacking Lehmann
who is one of the main integration persons (gcc/egcs).
