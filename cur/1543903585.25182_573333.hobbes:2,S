Err, that's crap. Have you even looked at gitweb? There's at least:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git
This has trees all the way back to 2.5.0.
and Linus also has:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/old-2.6-bkcvs.git
for the BK history.
That's already more history than most people have any immediate use for,
going beyond that starts getting in to general completeness before
practical application territory.
Anyone still sending 2.4 patches with the intent of them being moved
forward and applied to a current kernel needs to be killfiled.
