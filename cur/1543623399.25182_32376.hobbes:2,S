Please check the code. scsi_resize_dma_pool is called when you insmod a
module. It doesn't really matter if kswapd runs for 2 seconds during
insmod. And anyways if there would be some buggy code allocating dma in
a flood by mistake on a high end machine, then I can fix it completly by
tracking down when somebody freed dma pages over some watermark, but
that would add additional accounting that I don't feel needed, simply
because if you don't need DMA zone you shouldn't use GFP_DMA, I feel
fixing scsi is the right thing if something (but again, I don't see any
flood allocation during production with scsi).

You won't free the buffer headers only if you do DMA allocations and
by luck there will be no buffer headers in the DMA zone, otherwise it
will free the bh during DMA allocations too. remeber highmem classzone
means all the ram in the machine, not just highmem zone.

I don't see anything to fix, that should be just handled flawlessy.
