Sorry, I'm not in a position to merge all this stuff up.
There's a significant rewrite of the suspend code in -mm and we're having
trouble getting that merged up because Pat has limited time to work on
these things.
Until we get the existing rework settled and Pat has time to look at
suspend2 I'd rather not have to take it on.
