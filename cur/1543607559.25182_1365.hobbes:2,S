 Ah, that is a fine approach as well; I just considered the change small
enough it's not worth making it arch-specific.  Besides, my patch alsoo 
has a small advantage of keeping the search algorithm the same across all
the archs.

 I mean, the original algorithm as implemented in 2.4.9.  If you had asked
e.g. for memory above TASK_SIZE you would have got an error no matter how
much address space was still available below.

 OK, but I'd prefer to avoid searching overlapping areas over and over
again for performance's sake.  My solution does a single lookup and a
single search, effectively covering at least the whole space that would be
used if no address preference was specified; more if a program asked for
space below TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE (= "yes, I know what I'm doing, I want to
limit my brk() space").
