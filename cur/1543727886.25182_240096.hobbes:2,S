Just picked up on KernelTrap that there were some problems with
optimized AES code; if you wish, I can provide my own LGPL licensed (or
I can relicense them for you under GPL), as included in the BeeCrypt
Cryptography Library.
I have generic i586 code and SSE-optimized code available in GNU
assembler format. Latest version is always available on SourceForge
(
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=8924
).
Please cc: me for responses, as I'm not a list subscriber.
Sincerely,
