Sure it makes sense.
A program loads, runs and terminates. The OS of course recovers the
process' data space. If the bit is unset, it recovers the code space
as well.
If the bit is set, it should be keeping the program code in memory
(possibly paging it out, but that is irrelevant) unless/until it
has some other urgent need for that memory.
