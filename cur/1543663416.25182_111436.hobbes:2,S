Hmm. It seems to that all you need for SIOCDEVPRIVATE is ability to register
ranges of ioctls. 
i.e. something like this
        int register_ioctl32_conversion_rage(uint start, uint end, handler);
net/core/dev.c
        register_ioctl32_conversion_range(SIOCDEVPRIVATE, SIOCDEVPRIVATE + 15, siocdevprivate_ioctl);
Am I missing something here ?
