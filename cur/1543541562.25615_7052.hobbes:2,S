Can you please double-check exactly which kernel started doing this? I
have some mixed reports about the "test1-ac" series kernels doing this
too.  Which implies that the bug crept in somewhere during the -ac
series, and got propagated into the "proper" releases when I merged the
changes from Alan. 
But I would really _really_ prefer to know exactly which kernel it
started with. Otherwise there's going to be a ton of time wasted on
trying to figure out where it is..
The "test4-pre3 or so" report is useful, but it would be a lot more
useful to hear something like "I can definitely not reproduce the
problem in test4-pre2, but test4-pre3 _definitely_ shows it". Just so
that I _know_ I'm not chasing shadows.
(Sorry for the inconvenience, but I'd _really_ appreciate this problem
being farmed out a bit and people trying to help figure out at which
point it broke.  I don't see anything obviously wrong.  Which probably
just means that I'm blind)
		Thanks,
