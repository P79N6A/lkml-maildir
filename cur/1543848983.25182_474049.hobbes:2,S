Hi,
I can see that that makes it simple, but.. what would it MEAN? Eg what
would a system administrator use it for? It then no longer means "my mp3
player is guaranteed to get the streaming mp3 from the disk at this
bitrate" or something like that... so my question to you is: can you
describe what it'd bring the admin to put such an allocation in place?
If we find that it can be a good approach.. but if not, I'm less certain
this'll be used..
