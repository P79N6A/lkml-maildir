The most practical way of doing this would be to download bitkeeper and do
a binary search.
 1: Do `bk changes > foo'.
    This generates a monster changelog file which is your
    bisection-searching guide.  It has stuff like:
 ChangeSet@1.1734, 2004-05-21 22:59:48+01:00, tony@com.rmk.(none)
   [ARM PATCH] 1887/1: Update OMAP low level debug functions again
   
   Patch from Tony Lindgren
   
   This patch makes the low level debug functions work when support is
   compiled in for multiple OMAPs. The patch also removes now unnecessary
   include, incorrect comment, and SERIAL_REG_SHIFT ifdefs.
 2: Do
 	bl clone -ql -r1.1734 ref-repo test-repo
    and you have a tree up to and including 1.1734.
 3: cd test-repo ; bk -r get
 4: build, test, choose new revision, goto step 1.
It's probably possible to do the same with the CVS tree - I haven't tried.
