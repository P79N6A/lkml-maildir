Note that these ioctls _should_ still have different numbers because
of the struct sizes, but it is still a small conflict.

I had proposed a patch to the ext2 folks to remove the use of the 'v'
space ioctls from ext2.  This would (naturally) be a slow process,
first adding new ioctl numbers in the 'f' space with equivalent function,
then when we expect a reasonable percentage of systems with the new
ioctls, change the tools to try the new ones first and fall back to the
old ones, and finally removing the old ioctls completely.
While there were no complaints, it was a rather luke-warm reception.
There is one good reason to fix the conflict - strace doesn't have
to worry about IOC number conflicts, and can print the symbolic name.
Since these particular ioctls (EXT2_IOC_{GET,SET}VERSION) are not
particularly widely used, it shouldn't be a huge effort to change.
The first part of the change is below (it is already part of ext3 for
2.4).  It should pretty much apply cleanly to 2.2 as well as I don't
think this area has changed very much at all, and it can not possibly
do any harm.
Maybe for 2.5/2.6 a warning message would be printed if the old ioctl
number is being used, and 3.x would remove the old ioctl (4+ years
from now or so).
Cheers, Andreas
