	I have confirmed by email with Jens (cc'ed to Martin) that
Jens did not mean that Martin should step down as IDE maintainer
or anything like that.
	Jens was referring to the generic block code that he
maintains (including elv_add_request and drivers/block/block_ioctl.c,
which Martin had submitted patch for in IDE 115 without consulting
with Jens).
	Personally, I hope that Martin stays on as IDE maintainer.
Getting IDE to a maintainable state was a minefield that had to
be crossed.  Could someone else have done with fewer mistakes?
Maybe, but there was plenty of time for someone else to do it,
and nobody stepped up to the plate.  Of course there is a
trade-off point that point is more conservatively set with the
software that controls disk storage, but, in general, I think
it's important to be supportive of those who actually produce.
