Hi!
how could automatic system module loading be made with the latest
kernel? with 2.4 kernels, everything works fine, with 2.5, I have
installed the modules, but there's no modules.dep file, and not even my
network card module is loaded. Should I install some additional
software? My modutils version is 2.4.21. Thx.
Paco
