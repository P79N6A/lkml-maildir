	Nope. Sorry, I should have explain it better. If we are renaming
over the directory we should unhash the target at least for the time
between the beginning of emptiness check and the moment when we
cannibalize the target. Otherwise we are open for races (somebody could
grab the target and make it non-empty).
	d_move() is called only from rename() and since (a) all d_drops
are protected by semaphore on the parent and (b) we would cry foul if
somebody tried to pass unhashed dentry there we are OK. Bugs would be
caught in vfs_rename(). Now, if I missed a place where (a) would not be
true we are in much bigger trouble. It will screw a lot of places, not
only rename().
	Now, we could lock the target along with both parents, but I don't
like the perspective of triple_lock() somewhere in namei.c. Up to you,
indeed, but it seems to me that it's the only alternative.
