Well, in 20 minutes of playing, I am so far VERY impressed, the kmail 
composer is typing to the screen in unison to my keystrokes, where with 
the older version it often went away for 10 or more seconds at a time, 
then displayed the last sentence I had typed in one (or 2 sometimes) 
swell foop.  Now I can back up and correct a typo in real time whereas 
before, it was often faster if the typo was half a line back, and the key 
repeat so darned slow it was often over a second per character cell 
moved, to go grab the mouse, position the cursor on the typo, click, wait 
for the indicator to move, and then fix it.  Typing is now pleasurable 
again.  Key repeats seem to remain at the set in the bios key repeat 
speed.  Amazing.  I do believe you have given me back my machine.
I may find something to squawk about in due time, I think that Murphy guys 
laws may have a corollary on that subject, but it sure feels good right 
now.
