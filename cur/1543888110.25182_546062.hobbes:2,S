Thanks for doing these kinds of consolidations Sam, most of
us arch maintainers really appreciate it.
Looking at these patches reminds me of a quirk in the generic
RODATA definition:
>  #define RODATA								\
>  	. = ALIGN(4096);						\
>  	.rodata           : AT(ADDR(.rodata) - LOAD_OFFSET) {		\
It uses ALIGN(4096) which is likely supposed to be something
like ALIGN(PAGE_SIZE).  Perhaps we should handle this by
definiting a LD_PAGE_SIZE at the top of vmlinux.ld.S files
that need a value other than 4096, and define the default of
4096 in asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h?
If you could take care of this I'd really appreciate it.
