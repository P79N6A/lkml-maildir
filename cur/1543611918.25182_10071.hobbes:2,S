Hi!
I am implementing a kernel module for taking a packet out from the stack
at the IP level, redistributing the packet to another stack and puting
the packet into the new stack.
Question: do I need to register a target for this?
Can I call a hook in the same way that I am getting called if I am
registering to a hook?
