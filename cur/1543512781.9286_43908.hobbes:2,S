Actually, the process can only use the amount of CPU time not consumed by
tasks of high priority. The way that real time systems use this is
controlling what tasks are at the higher priority and figuring out what the
maximum schedulable priority is given the tasks which have to be performed.
MPEG players would be a rather simple RT task to schedule since you have a
fixed amount of work that is very periodic.
Look into Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA), sometimes also known as Rate
Monotonic Scheduling, it will show how to design and verify operation of a
hard real time scheduling problem.
I'm not sure how much of this is applicable to Linux, since I've never
looked at the RT priority support on UNIX varients.
