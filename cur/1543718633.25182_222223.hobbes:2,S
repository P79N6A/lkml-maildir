You have to parse all the valid header bytes (the opcode prefixes) that
change segment, cause repeats and change sizes. DOSemu has a worked example
of this particular set of horrors.

gcc generates a lot of cmov on i686 so many that people I've talked with
on the compiler side also feel cmov emulation isnt useful. Newer Eden btw
has cmov.
