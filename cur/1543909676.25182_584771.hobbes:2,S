So, looking at load instead of store, understand I correctly that in
your opinion
	int b;
	b = atomic_read(&a);
	if (b)
		do_something_time_consuming();
	b = atomic_read(&a);
	if (b)
		do_something_more();
should be changed to explicitly forget(&a) after
do_something_time_consuming?
If so, how about the following:
static inline void A(atomic_t *a)
{
	int b = atomic_read(a);
	if (b)
		do_something_time_consuming();
}
static inline void B(atomic_t *a)
{
	int b = atomic_read(a);
	if (b)
		do_something_more();
}
static void C(atomic_t *a)
{
	A(a);
	B(b);
}
Would this need forget(a) after A(a)?
(Is the latter actually answered in C99 or is it compiler-dependent?)
