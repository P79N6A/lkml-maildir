Hi Bernhard,
I can reproduce this problem only on one machine. I think there is some
race condition and your code somehow just exposes it.
I put few WARN_ON(!desc->action) in handle_edge_irq() and what I find
that after handle_IRQ_event(), desc->action has become null. That means
in the meantime somebody has gone ahead and modified the desc. This must
have happened because we have release desc->lock while running
handle_IRQ_event().
This means there is a race somewhere. It is verified by the fact that
this problem does not occur if same system is booted with only one
cpu (maxcpus=1).
Thanks
Vivek
