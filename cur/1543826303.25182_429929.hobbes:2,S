This is exactly backwards, and so it tests different code paths.
The line discipline is involved into driving a cooked mode port,
e.g. the one where getty is.
Running uploads and downloads with things like xmodem is a good
test of hardware flow control, so someone will have to do it too.

PL-2303 already has a DB-9, you actually you need a DB-9-to-DB-9
Null Modem (cross-over) cable.
Anyway, I do not expect pl2303 failing this test, mind. It's more
of a problem for simpler devices.
