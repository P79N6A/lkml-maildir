hmm..  Overlapping emails.
The crash with e2fsck was easily repeatable with the above patch.  Just
dirty a few buffers and run /sbin/sync.  It's due to the __make_request
queue_head thing which you fixed in test12-pre3.  Yes, this was IDE.
However the original problem of a list_del being performed on a wild
pointer is being seen on SCSI systems.  I expect the above patch will
catch it if it's still happening.
