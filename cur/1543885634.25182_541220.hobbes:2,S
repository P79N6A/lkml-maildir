yeah ..this is truly a problem if SCHED_FIFO user-space cpu hog task is
running at MAX_USER_RT_PRIO (which happens to be same as max real-time
priority kernel threads can attain - MAX_RT_PRIO).
One option is to make MAX_USER_RT_PRIO < MAX_RT_PRIO. I am not sure what
semantics that will break (perhaps the real-time folks can clarify
that).
The other easier option is to add a wake_up_process_to_front() API in
sched.c, which essentially wakes up the process and enqueues the task to
the front of runqueue.
