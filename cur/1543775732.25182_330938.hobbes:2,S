Hi Jens,
thanks for your quick reply!

Thanks for the hint! As others already mentioned, STANDBY_NOW may not be
the best option in this case - we shall investigate what the IBM Windows
driver is using here.

Sorry, my comments may have been misleading - I agree that this should
be better done in userspace.
The kernel module just reads out the accelerometer, a user space app
could then interpret the values and take appropriate action (e.g.
parking the hdd head). This allows other apps to make use of these
acceleratometer values as well (think SDL for games).
Bye,
