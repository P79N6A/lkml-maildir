I have not seen any explanations:
- Why did the upstream author write the code that way?
- Why are your changes correct?
- Why do your changes allow the compiler to produce faster code?
The upstream author of the code is available - and he might be able to 
help you getting answers. No matter whether your changes are incorrect 
or correct optimizations that should go upstream, in both cases 
discussing these issues with upstream is the best solution.
And testing is nice, but if you broke some case that's outside of your 
tests you'll never notice.
