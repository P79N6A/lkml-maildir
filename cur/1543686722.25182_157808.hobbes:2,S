For this particular bug (before all the patches started flying around),
you'd have to add a kernel annotation to the "struct i2c_msg" field
buf.  But you still have the problem that sparse silently ignores
missing annotations, so you can never tell if you've missed something
important.  Cqual infers the annotations on its own, so you never have
to worry that some might be missing or wrong.
That's also how we get away with just ~200 annotations.  From these
"seed" annotations, cqual figures out everything else on its own.

That's a good idea, but is that possible?  In other words, can the tty
core always tell how much to copy into kernel space?  The solution I
propose is a very simple change that fits easily into the current
architecture.

I was afraid that might happen.  I'll do a patch against test4 when it's
available.  Thanks for your suggestions.
Best,
