Mmm, what is the current status on all this.
How does the new fbdev api compare with ruby, is it the same thing or not, and
how does the ruby tree compare with the -dj one ?
And what is the current status of fbdev in 2.5.x ? 2.5.1 + ruby hang my box
early in the boot process, but that is probably because pm3fb is not working
yet for ruby. Does matroxfb work ? i have an older pci matrox board that i
could install to test and do some pm3fb work if needed (and if i get the time
for it :(((0
