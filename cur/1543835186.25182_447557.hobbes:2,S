The app must try mmap.  From the application side, you can't know
whether you're 32bit-emulation mode or it's really on 32bit
architecture.  And, mmap is usually done automatically via alsa-lib
plugin for optimization or soft-mixing purpose.

Dunno.  pcm_compat.c is only for 32bit context on 64bit architecture.
The 64bit program will never go there.
