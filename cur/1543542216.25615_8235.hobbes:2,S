Nobody will send you a sane patch without you at least hinting
at what you might like to see. I'm sure many of us would be happy
to write the code, but not under the expectation that it will
be rejected. I wasted quite a bit of my time on the last patch
I sent you, and I'm not about to do that again.
The thread-process mess mostly hits me with procps, which can
not be fixed without kernel changes. I need the kernel to spit
out /proc entries in an order such that threads of a single
process appear next to each other; sorting is not OK to do.
BIG PROBLEM: if the lead thread of a process exits and the PID
gets reused, then the new process has unrelated threads????
Perhaps you could answer this post from March, which dealt with
PID wrap-around, kill(), and the ugly mess in /proc:
