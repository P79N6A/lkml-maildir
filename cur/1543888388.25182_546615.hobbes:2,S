Here is the tool to make such calculations.
Result of running the tool on / partition of ext3 file system (each
chunk is 4 times a block group):
./cref.sh /dev/hda1 dmp /mnt/test 4
-------------------------------------------------------
Number of files = 221763
Number of directories = 24456
Total size = 8193116 KB
Total data stored = 7179200 KB
Size of block groups = 131072 KB
Number of inodes per block group = 16288
Chunk size = 524288 KB
No. of cross references between directories and sub-directories = 869
No. of cross references between directories and file = 584
Total no. of cross references = 13806 (dir ref = 1453, file ref = 12353)
