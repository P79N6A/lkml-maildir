I repeated the test on an ext3 partition, and the response with 28
dbench clients running is definitely better, although I'm starting to
get some stalls of a couple seconds while typing this in Evolution on
the machine under test.  Now it's becoming intolerable, so I aborted the
dbench run so I could finish this email.
This was with 2.5.65-mm2 and elevator=as.  I'll repeat soon with
elevator=deadline.  I didn't try typing in Evolution with 2.5.65-bk
under high loads, so I'll also give that a try.
Summary: using ext3, the simple window shake and scrollbar wiggle tests
were much improved, but really using Evolution left much to be desired.
