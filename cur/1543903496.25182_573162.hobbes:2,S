For review purposes the split is often file based.
Something along the lines of:
Makefile + Kconfig
include/linux/drdb*   <= why 5 files for one module?
drdb_main.c
drdb_req.{c+h}
etc..
So essentially smaller pieces that can be revied but when ready for inclusion
it should go in as _one_ commit to avoid breaking bisect.
But please finish off all the CodingStyle issue before submission so the
review can concentrate on the actual content.
Quickly browsing drdb_int.h shows that there are a few issues yet to sort out.
typedef usage, funny macros, volatile etc.
