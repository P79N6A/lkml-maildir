Unfortunately the unplugging changes in Jen's block tree have trashed these
patches to a degree that I'm not confident in my repair attempts.  So I'll
drop the fasio patches from -mm.
Zach's observations regarding this code's reliance upon things at *current
sounded pretty serious, so I expect we'd be seeing changes for that anyway?
Plus Jens's unplugging changes add more reliance upon context inside
*current, for the plugging and unplugging operations.  I expect that the
fsaio patches will need to be aware of the protocol which those proposed
changes add.
