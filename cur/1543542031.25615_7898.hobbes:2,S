I would like to provide a new printk() (unlocked_printk()) that does not
take any locks.  This would be used by panic() and the like, were we
don't care about the locks an _REALLY_ want to get the message out.
What I am proposing is that printk() take the locks and then call
unlocked_printk(), i.e. share the real body of printk().  The problem I
am having is in how to set up the var_args call.  Does anyone know how
to pass var_args comming in on to the inner function?
Also, another mystery, how, where, does printk.c include std_args.h?
