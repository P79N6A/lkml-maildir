Linus/Alan,
please accept the following patch for knfsd in 2.4.0-prerelease.
What it does is extend the protection offered by  s_nfsd_free_path_sem
to cover the first call to nfsd_iget.
I had previously avoided this as I didn't think it was necessary and
it ment that the semaphore wasn't claimed at all on the common path.
However Chip Salzenberg managed to convince me that it is needed.
I think that his case-in-point is mentioned towards the end of
  
http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/computing/01/03/linux.mission.idg/index.html
under "Taking the plunge".
There is actually more that I would like to do to this code, but I
don't think now is the right time.  This is the minimal change that
will fix a real bug.
