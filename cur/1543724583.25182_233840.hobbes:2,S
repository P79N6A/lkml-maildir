Actually, it does work on most of UP/IDE machines by now.
Remaining problems tend to be unsupported drivers. I can't help
with devices I do not have, unfortunately, so there's little I can do.
I'm working on smp support just now... But some progress indication is
must have in future - we had people going "ouch I thought it is stuck"
when they in fact needed to wait 30seconds.
