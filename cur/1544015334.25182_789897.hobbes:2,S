This is a major disadvantage of the btrees.
See all the hoops we ended up jumping through with things like
radix_tree_preload() and idr_pre_get().
The IDR code there wasn't very well designed and still has holes.  The
radix-tree code afaik is solid, but look at all the stuff it does!

No, mempools won't help, particularly if items are being added from
atomic contexts.
This is a major major shortcoming which greatly limits the usefulness
of btrees and which greatly reduces the chances of anyone migrating any
rbtree users over to btrees.
