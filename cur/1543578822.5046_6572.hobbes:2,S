in this case there could still be valid performance differences, as
copying from user-space is cheaper than copying from the pagecache. To
rule out SMP interactions, you could try a UP-IOAPIC kernel on that box.
(I'm also curious what kind of numbers you'll get with the zerocopy
patch.)

no, in the case of a single thread this should have minimum impact. But
i'd suggest to increase the /proc/sys/net/tcp*mem* values (to 1MB or
more).
