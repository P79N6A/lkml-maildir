You dont realistically expect to learn how to program reading 
Documentation/CodingStyle, do you? CodingStyle merely serves as general 
guidelines of what is considered good practice among kernel development, 
no more no less. If you dont know how to code in the first place (which 
you have proved spectacularly, by now), you're SOL.
Go educate yourself and stop trolling. Somewhere, along the bucketloads 
of vomit you insisted in throwing here, you asked who were the other 
top-rank trolls -- sincerely, and as far as I can remember, you're ahead 
by a fair margin. Not even imel96@trustix.co.id with his delireous 
"single user linux" crap came anywhere near you, although he was, too, 
very resistant to being clued in.
See things from this end -- when 99% of the people tell you you're wrong, 
consider the possibility you are _actually_ wrong, and not the other way 
around.
Now, off to ~/.killfile you go.
