If only it were that easy.
There has already been a case mentioned of a binary module that messed up something that was only 
visible once that module was unloaded and another one loaded.  It all depends totally on usage patterns.
Generally speaking, if a user is technical enough to patch their kernel, they're aware of the 
possible problems and will submit bug reports with things like "kernel version blah, with the foo 
and bar patches applied".  The developers can then say "there's a known issue with foo/bar together".
Binary modules, on the other hand, are often loaded up by users that know just barely enough to 
download them and run an install script.  In this case, it can be helpful to know up front that 
there has been proprietary code running in kernel space, and aside from calls to kernel APIs, we 
have no clue what else it was doing, what memory was being trampled, what cpu registers were 
whacked, etc.
