It is even worse since it can return same values. Suppose counter is 0 :
TASK0                   TASK1
top:
ret <- v->counter     ; ret = 0
inc ret               ; ret -> 1
LOCK incl v->counter  ; counter -> 1
			top:
			ret <- v->counter     ; ret = 1
			inc ret               ; ret -> 2
			LOCK incl v->counter  ; counter -> 2
			cmp v->counter, ret   ; match !! got 2
			jz end
			...
cmp v->counter, ret  ; ret == 1 , counter == 2 no-match
jz end
LOCK decl v->counter ; counter -> 1
jmp top
Then TASK0 starts again with no interruption and gets 2. You need
instrucions that does atomic mod/cmp to do this kind of tricks.
