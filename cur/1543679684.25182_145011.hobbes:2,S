That is an inappropriate comment in this list.  As far as the
kernel code is concerned, Documentation/Changes defines what C
is :-), and it says "GCC 2.95.3 or later".
Since 2.95.3 does not support declaration-in-the-middle,
decl-in-the-middle is not a valid C (yet).  On the other hand,
other C99 extentions that compiler can grok (e.g. '.FIELDNAME ='
style initializer) is now already part of valid C :-).
