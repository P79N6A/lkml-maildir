Ingo,
	I obtained some latency measurements of migrate_all_tasks() on 
a 4-way 1.2 GHz Power4 PPC64 (p630) box. They are as below:
Number of Tasks		Cycles (get_cycles) spent in migrate_all_tasks (ms)
===========================================================================
     10536 			803244 (5.3 ms)
     30072  			2587940 (17 ms)
	Extending this to 100000 tasks makes the stoppage time to be for
8 million cycles (~50 ms).
	My main concern of stopping the machine for so much time
was not performance, rather the effect it may have on functioning of the 
system.  The fact that we freeze the machine for (possibly) tons of 
cycles doing nothing but migration made me uncomfortable.  _and_ the fact that 
it can very well be avoided :)
Can we rule out any side effects because of this stoppage? Watchdog timers, 
cluster heartbeats, jiffies, ..?  Not sure ..
It just felt much more "safe" and efficient to delegate migration to more 
safer time in CPU_DEAD notification, when rest of the machine is running.
Plus this avoids the cpu_is_offline check in the more hotter path 
(load_balance/try_to_wake_up)!!
