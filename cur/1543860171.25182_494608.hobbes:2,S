Existing possibility to mark event as ready works following way:
event is queued into storage queue (socket, inode or some other queue),
when readiness condition becomes true, event is queued into ready queue
(although it is still in the storage queueu). It happens completely
asynchronosu to _any_ kind of userspace processing.
When userspace calls apropriate syscall, event is being copied into ring
buffer.
Thus userspace readiness will just mark event as ready, i.e. it queues
event into ready queue, so later usersapce will callsyscall to actually
get the event.
When one thread is parked in the syscall and there are _no_ events
which should be marked as ready (for example only sockets are there, and
it is not a good idea to wakeup the whole socket processing state machine), 
then there is no possibility to receive such event (although it is
possible to interrupt and break syscall).
So, according to injecting ready events, it can be done - just an
addition of special flag which will force kevent core to move event into
ready queue immediately. In this case userspace can event prepare a
needed event (like signal event) and deliver it to process, so it will
think (only from kevent point of view) that real signal has been arrived.
I will also add special type of events - userspace events - which will
not have empty callbacks, which will be intended to use for user-defined
way (i.e. for inter thread communications).
