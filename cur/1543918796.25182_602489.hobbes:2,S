Bitfields are wrong. Period. Don't use them.
__LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD vs. __BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD is Linux way to cope
with existing code using them that needs fixing on architectures that
have C bitfields in reverse order but that's not even something that can
be properly relied upon generally.
Just don't use bitfields and be happy.
