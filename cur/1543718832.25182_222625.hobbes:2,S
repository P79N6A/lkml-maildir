Personally, I'd like to see this evolve into something along the lines
of ISO-9000. If linux development can have the ability to create
detailed audit trails of code changes there would never be a question
about who contributed what and who owns it.
It would be nice if some sort of ISO-9000 compliance were a long term
goal here. The proprietary software houses would go nuts.

If you think what I'm saying is "politically incorrect",
you've got the wrong politics.
Tired of `netiquette'? Fed up with endless discussion of
what is '[OT]'? Linux, Free/Open Source discussion without
the "political correctness:"
