Yeah, maybe ARM never cared for SMP. But we do care :)

Non-x86 could have it set to NULL, in which case it doesn't get called.
(I know the current code does not take care of this situation).
But having an explicit 'all_cpus_idle' interface may be good, since 
Tony talked of idling some devices when all CPUs are idle. So it
probably has non-x86/PIT uses too.

If we consider that only s390 needs it and other arch's dont, then it need 
not be even part of the init code. Basically the notifier list can be maintained
by s390 in its arch-code entirely and have 'stop_hz_timer' call into
dyn_tick_reprogram_timer (or something like that)? But I feel there will be 
other uses for the notifier list (I know the slab reap timer fires every two 
seconds and that may be unnecessary on idle CPUs if it is not reaping 
anything - perhaps it could use such a notifier to fire at longer intervals on 
idle CPUs? That may be true of other short-timers that kernel/drivers may be 
using. This is just a thought and may need more consideration before we 
put a notifier mechanism in arch-independent code).

Everything can be represented in bits! I was just comparing composition
of structures in ARM and x86. The state bitfield is part of 
'struct dyn_tick_timer' itself in ARM while it is part of a separate structure 
(dyn_tick_state) in x86. Similar minor points need to be sorted out while 
unifying.
