2.2.18pre24 works just fine, sound and everything, with KDE 2.0.  That's
what I'm running right now.  I had to fool around with the reiserfs-3.5.27
patch for one file, but that was no problem.

OK, I patched in the above for both 2.4.0-test12-pre4 and pre5, but did not 
get any "unable to enable" printk messages appearing in /var/log/messages.
The behavior of course is the same, that is, sound will work under GNOME, but 
starting up KDE 2.0 freezes the machine.   To get modules to work with 
2.4.0-test12-pre5, I had to modify linux/include/linux/module.h, line 348, as 
was the case with test12-pre4. This was the patch that was posted to the list 
by Mohammad A. Haque. (Put parenthesis around the bare some_struct).
Here are some lines from messages for the three bootups which I tried:
From 2.2.18pre24: (sound works with both KDE 2.0 and GNOME)

I guess my next step is to learn how to set up a Serial Console for further 
troubleshooting.  Any further help appreciated.
