OK, without any of the DEBUG_* options enabled the kernel SEEMS to work with 
no problems. But I don't know how I can assure there actually is no memory 
corruption...
For me the big question stays why enabling the DEBUG_* options results in a 
corrupt cursor and the false dots on the top of each row... (with both 
kernels)
And, of course, why enabling vesafb in -mm1 leads to memory corruption. (as 
Vladis already mentioned, the same binary works if vesafb is not enabled via 
the 'vga=xxx' boot option).
