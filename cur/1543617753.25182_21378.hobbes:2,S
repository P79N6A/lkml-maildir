Uh .. why not let Linus just run this program on *his* machine, and putting
up the patch again as a "program to be run"? ;-)
Saves Linus of the headache to check if there are any bugs in the patch
before applying ( and that too, with the funny label of "lossy something"
he's earned ... saves a lot of bandwidth! ;-) )
