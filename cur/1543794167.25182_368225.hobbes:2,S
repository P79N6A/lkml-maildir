Yes, I agree with your analysis: I was expecting Dominik's resume
failure to have a more conventional cause, but yes, it's from that
new vbetool actually corrupting the memory instead of using it as
a template.
Right, no warning message then.  (Some other time we might want to
withdraw the feature - as you said, they could just read /dev/mem -
and put in a research warning in preparation; but right now I've
had enough of such noise.)
Dominik's Bad page states I'll be thinking about later in the day.
