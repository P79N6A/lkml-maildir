Ok, right, sorry, the patch was indeed correct, just the reason for the 
compilation breakage was not quite what you suggested. So, I'll apply your 
putch, but please fix mt9m001.c in the same patch too - it also includes 
gpio.h conditionally. Although, it does test the correct macro.
Actually, this CONFIG option might disappear completely in the future, if 
we decide to switch to a module parameter instead. So that one kernel can 
be used on systems with and without the GPIO.
Thanks
