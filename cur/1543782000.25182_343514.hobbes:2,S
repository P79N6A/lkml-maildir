Somewhere there is a mistake in the white space processing code of the
firmware driver. Before this patch we had inconsistent handling of
whitespace and sysfs attributes. This patch forces it to be consistent
and will shake out all of the places in the drivers where it is
handled wrong. Sysfs attributes are now stripped of leading and
trailing white space before being handed to the device driver.
Fbdev sysfs attributes are also broken for white space handling and
need to be fixed. Overall the patch should be correct and it is the
drivers that are broken.
