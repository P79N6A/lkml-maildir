Hi.
It would be good to have a ioctl to erase the scrollbackbuffer. This
ioctl could be issued (as one possible application) by a small
programm, every time a user logs out, so nobody can read afterwards
what the user had on the display.
Now this is only possibly by changing the terminal. This can be
automated by two VT_ACTIVATE/VT_WAITACTIVATE-ioctls, but this
is an ugly hack.
What do you think?
