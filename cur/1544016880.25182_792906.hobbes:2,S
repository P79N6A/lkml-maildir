Does it translate into a temporary network hiccup, say a few seconds,
or does it mean a final loss of networking ?
Given the timestamp, the driver seemed to worked for some amount of time
before breaking, did it not ? It would thus be different from the usual
"no link at startup" problem.
Can you send a complete dmesg, including the r8169 XID line ?
