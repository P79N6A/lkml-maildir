In the current implementation, it's only happens if the only clocks that
exist are "tsc" and "jiffies" which makes verification impossible
anyway .. It's unlikely, but it is possible , the fix is not that
complex.

Do you know that this is needed ? The current implementation
(clocksource watchdog) doesn't fully settle until after
device_initcall() .. So boot-up is about 99% complete ..
It's trivial to make my version do verification during most of
device_initcall() ..
