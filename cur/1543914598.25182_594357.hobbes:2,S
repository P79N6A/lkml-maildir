Andrew:  
I originally sent in the "update-n_high_memory..." patch against
23-rc3-mm1 on 27aug to fix a problem that I introduced when I moved the
populating of N_HIGH_MEMORY state to free_area_init_nodes().  This would
miss setting the "has memory" node state for hot added memory.  I never
saw any response, but then it ended up in 23-rc4-mm1.
This Tuesday, Paul Mundt sent in a patch to fix a build problem with
MEMORY_HOTPLUG_SPARSE introduced by my patch.  He replaced zone->node
with zone_to_nid(zone) in the node_set_state() arguments.
The latest patch, from Yasunori-san, I believe, starts kswapd for nodes
to which memory has been hot-added.  As I understand it, his is needed
because the memoryless nodes patch results in no kswapd for memoryless
nodes.
Does that help?
