This approach is not particularly synchronous.  Take the case of an add
failure: how long would an application wait before deciding that the new
device is not going to appear?
It might be preferable to have the write to the probe function fail. 
For example, if we can't find the device node, return -EINVAL or
something.

If we are scrapping the use of of_device for ibmebus devices, can we
still create a devspec file for OF correlation purposes?
Thanks-
