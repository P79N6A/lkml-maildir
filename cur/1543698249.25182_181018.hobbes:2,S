We could probably implement a generic striped allocate, which would
do a vmalloc or similar on 64 bit, and either the magic boottime
node-alloc hack, or just a straight node 0 alloc on 32 bit (ie use
vmalloc where needed, without crippling other platforms).
Someone had a patch to do round-robin already (Manfred?) - IMHO doing
it from the node with the most free mem each time would be better, if
we're not going to stripe.

but yes, that does look utterly screwed ;-)
