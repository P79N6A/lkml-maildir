I tried downloading and compiling the futex-2.2 package, and ran into 
some snags.
The linux/futex.h file uses a number of nonstandard data types but does 
not itself include any other headers.  IN addition, the "u32" data type 
  is problematic, since it is only defined in the kernel headers if 
__KERNEL__ is defined.  Perhaps it should be defined as "__u32"?
Also, there is a definition of sys_futex in the package headers that 
does not match the definition in the latest kernel headers.  Any plans 
to update the package?
