Please get in touch with Steffen Evers and Riley Williams if you want to
do such things and look in the kernel-list archives for the thread
called 'script for compiling the kernel' (in reverse order :-). You may
also want to check out how caldera manages their hardware recognition,
however, I don't know how good that is.
