That's -185 ppm (parts per million) error, or -0.0185%.
Typical cheap quartz crystals are +/- 100 ppm, but there are some cheaper
than that, and ceramic resonators like

I know Dave Mills learned from experience that the original +/-100 ppm
specs in NTP weren't wide enough and he had to change it to cope with
+/-500 ppm error in some clocks.
It *could* just be your motherboard's clock source.
