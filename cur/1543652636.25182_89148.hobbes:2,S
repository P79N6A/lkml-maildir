Oh well... it was just an idea.
All I know for certain is that I've got a machine here with fiber channel
running to a 7-disk Linux software RAID-0 array (240GB, stolen from a defunct
NetApp) that would lock up and die all the time, even using 2.4.19. Using
2.5.44, which includes the patch I mentioned before, it's been up for 23
days rock solid. [side note: The layout of the disks in my raidtab reversed
annoyingly between 2.4 and 2.5... whose bright idea was that?].
Providing more information (hardware info, log messages, so forth) might
allow the more capable people on the list to debug your problem.
Thanks,
-Eric
