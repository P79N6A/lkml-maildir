You sound alarmed!  If that's alarmed enough to find out what
the real problem is, maybe you'll end up fixing it ... :)
I could be wrong about the problem being in the HID code, but
that does look like a likely home for the bug.  We know there
are other issues with HID/input/hiddev/... that need attention.

Agreed, oopsing == bad.  HID needs more attention.  I suspect whoever
dives into that will want to know what you mean by "(mostly) fine";
that might give a clue about what 2.6 changes worsened the failures.
