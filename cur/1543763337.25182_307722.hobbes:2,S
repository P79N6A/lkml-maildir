Well, REQ_SPECIAL is the signal to the mid-layer that we've allocated
the resources necessary to process the command, so in practice it will
be turned on for every requeue request (because we set it when the
command is prepared), so this patch would have no effect on your stated
quiesce problem.  However, if you think about how requests work with
head insertion and one command following another, there's really not a
huge problem here either.
The other reason I don't like this is that we've been trying hard to
sweep excess block knowledge out of the mid-layer.  I don't think
REQ_SOFTBARRIER is anything we really have to know about.
