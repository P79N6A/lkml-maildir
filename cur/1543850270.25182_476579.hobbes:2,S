  git-1.4.3.3.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)

  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.3.3-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
Sorry to be doing three follow-up releases in a row.  This is
primarily fix the partitioning of programs in generated RPM.  If
you are installing all of git it does not matter, but by mistake
we were placing git-archive into git-arch subpackage, which
meant that you need to install tla only to use git-tar-tree and
git-archive --format=zip.
Thanks for Gerrit for noticing and reporting it, although he is
from Debian camp ;-).
