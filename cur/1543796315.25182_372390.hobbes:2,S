I'm only guessing since I'm not entirely sure what Mr. Boldi means,
but my guess is that he's proposing that an app can bind to an IP
address without that address being assigned to any currently available
interface and then later if that IP does get assigned to an interface
the app will start recieving traffic then. Also possibly allowing the
address to be removed from one interface and then later assigned to
another one without apps noticing.
I don't know /if/ that is what was meant, but that's how I read it.

I'm believe Mr. Boldi is refering to OSI as in Open Systems
Interconnection (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
), not as in
Open Source Initiative.
