The ea-in-inode patch totally relies on getting all the available inode space 
cleared out by the kernel (or mke2fs, or e2fsck). If this is not the case for 
any inode we find, then i_extra_isize may contain a random number, and we've 
just lost, period: There is no way of sanitizing a random i_extra_isize; we 
cannot know what the right number would be.
We have two options for going forward from here: (a) depend on the fact that 
all inodes have been cleared out for us, or (b) don't rely on that, fix 
e2fsck before going any further, and have the fixed mke2fs and e2fsck set a 
filesystem feature flag that tells us that all the extra space in all inodes 
is "sane".
For (a) we can make an (ugly) exception because we know which inodes mke2fs 
created. As far as I can tell we can also fully rely on the kernel having 
cleared out the extra space for us. e2fsck may currently fail to move the 
extra space around when moving inodes, but that did not matter without 
ea-in-inode, and if we fix it now, that's probably good enough. We don't 
really care which inode's zeroed extra space we look at without ea-in-inode.

IMHO it's not debatable. Taking an i_extra_isize that looks odd and simply 
changing it to something we think is better is a really bad idea. We might as 
well find an unusual but still valid i_extra_isize and use it, then a future 
patch allocates a few more fields in the inode, and suddenly we start to see 
garbage.

You may have an access acl on the inode. Not being able to read an access acl 
is a clear sign of trouble. The same applies for everything else in the 
system.* and security.* namespaces, at least.

Repairing the filesystem has no place in the kernel code. If what you assume 
is the case (and I sure would have assumed you to check before proposing the 
kernel patch for inclusion), we have to go for the filesystem feature flag 
approach.

That's even better, yes.

I disagree. We cannot just use the space when we think the inode is corrupted.
