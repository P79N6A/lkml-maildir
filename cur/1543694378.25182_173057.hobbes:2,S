I don't think that's true.  For example, the perfmon module in ia64
needs a fast pseudo-random number generator in order to randomize
sampling intervals.  It doesn't have to be a great RNG (certainly not
crypto-secure), but it does have to have reasonable properties to
avoid statistical bias.  We have tried without in-kernel RNG and the
results were unusable (e.g., resetting the sampling intervals in
user-space was far too costly and not randomizing the sampling
intervals caused horrible bias).  The RNG we settled on for now is the
Carta's (see arch/ia64/lib/carta_random.S), which is quite fast and
compact (all of 19 machine instructions).
