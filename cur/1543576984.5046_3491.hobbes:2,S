Hi all,
Here is a problem we have been strugling with and we hope someone can
offers us some clues:
We have a server that handles a large number of client requests (approx
200 req/sec) and has a large memory footprint (approx. 1.3GB). From this
1.3GB, 512MB are allocated as a big chunk during startup and are use as
a local memory cache inside the server process and ~700MB are
dynamically allocated for an internal data structure used to serve
requests.
Also, to service each request many small amounts of memory (from a few
bytes to ~10 KB/request)
are allocated using new() and are later released when the request has
been served.
We run this server on a machine with 2GB of physical memory and after
24hr of continuous operation select() and poll fail with ENOMEM (and
without
change in the number of file descriptors that each must handle compared
to earlier in the run). 
At this point top(1) reports (it's a multi-threaded application).

So why is the kernel having difficulty allocating memory for its
internal operations? We are suspecting memory fragmentation issues 
(at the application level which might have adverse sideefects for the
kernel). Is it something that we can do so that the kernel will be
able to allocate the needed memory for carrying out the system call?
We are running RH 6.2 (kernel 2.2.14-5.0) Kernel configured with BIGMEM
enabled and CONFIG_1GB (Are those config options even related?)
thanks in advance,
