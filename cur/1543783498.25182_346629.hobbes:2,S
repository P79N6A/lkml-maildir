Only as an option - it's not always possible.
For example one might have a Windows partition already in place, etc..

Fair enough.  It took 5 seconds of googling to find a guy whose GRUB
stopped working because of the HPA, so at least *some* people are
already having problems...

I can't think of any, but you might be right.

If HPA were exposed as /dev/.../hpa then it wouldn't be possible to
create such a filesystem. I'm guessing it's not possible with Windows
either, or with any BIOS-based OS.
Creating filesystems that include the HPA defeats the entire idea of
the HPA in the first place.
If one does not care to use the HPA, one should disable it in the BIOS
entirely, so that everywhere (!) the entire disk is seen.
The inclusion of the HPA in /dev/.../disc should be a special case for
those unfortunate souls with laptops where the HPA cannot be disabled
because their BIOS is crap, IMHO.
