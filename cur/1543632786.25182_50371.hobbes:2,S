It will actually survive any 3 disk failures. It is reasonable
if you have a lot of disks. It requires at least 9 disks and
I would prefere at least 25 disks.
RAID-4 and RAID-5 are very similar. And it happens to be the
case that if you only use two disks RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5
are all identical. And each of them can survive a single disk
failure.
Any two of these RAIDs on top of each other can survive three
disk failures. That is true because it takes four disk failures
to loose data. On the upper most RAID you must loose two of the
lower level RAIDs, each of these two must have lost two disks.
RAID-4 on top of RAID-4 is actually just a two-dimentional
parity. RAID-5 on top of RAID-5 is very similar.
