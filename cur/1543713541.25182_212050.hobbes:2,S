I was seeing this when I added it to my tree circa 2.6.1: 
 701262   58619   15616  775497   bd549 vmlinux before 
 700530   58619   15616  774765   bd26d vmlinux after
..which I would expect to grow with code size.
On the other hand, I'm now seeing:
      0       0       0       0       0 arch/i386/kernel/i386_ksyms.o
So something's changed.
