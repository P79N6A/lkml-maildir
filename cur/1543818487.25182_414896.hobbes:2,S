What you say with the above is that you want to create two modules.
One module named: bfin_ad7171fb
and another module named: rgb2ycbcr
But kbuild does not support creating modules based on a .S file alone.
What I expect you to say is that you have one module named: bfin_7171
this is expressed like this:
obj-$(CONFIG_FB_BFIN_7171) += bfin_7171.o
bfin_7171-y := bfin_ad7171fb.o rgb2ycbcr.o
And then it works with your .S file.
