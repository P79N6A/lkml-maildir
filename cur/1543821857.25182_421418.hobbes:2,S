The page_zonenum() checks look good, but I'm not sure I understand the
page_in_zone_hole() part.  If a page is in a hole in a zone, it will
still have a valid mem_map entry, right?  It should also never have been
put into the allocator, so it also won't ever be coalesced.  
I'm a bit confused. :(
BTW, I like the idea of just aligning HIGHMEM's start because it has no
runtime cost.  Buuuuut, it is still just a shift and compare of the two
page->flags, which should already be (or will soon anyway be) in the
cache.
