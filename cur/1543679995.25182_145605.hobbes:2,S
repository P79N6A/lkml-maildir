Subject: [linux-kernel][BUG since 2.4.21] PCM sound volume not working

Hello,
I'm currently running 2.4.22pre3 and noticed adjusting
the sound volume using XMMS didn't work anymore (but using
gnome-1.4's sound-applet works, it controls the Master volume).
Booting back into 2.4.21, I realized it didn't work either...
Booting back into 2.4.21rc7 solved the problem.
XMMS is set to use OSS (not ESD), and volume controls PCM, not
Master.
I'm currently not subscribed to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org due to
a mail server problem, please CC me.
