so far I've been using kernels 2.4.32. I've upgraded to 2.6.17.1 and I've 
noticed a something not right. TCP connection arent closed when user is over 
his limit for open connections (ulimit -n). In my previous kernel 
connections was new imedietly closed is user were above limit. Now however 
connectios are kept open until client site timeouts - so it might be forever 
open.
