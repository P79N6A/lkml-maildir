Hi
I found the following error messages in my system log this morning.
===snip===
Jul 27 08:34:24 dalwhinnie kernel: wait (CPU#0)
Jul 27 08:34:24 dalwhinnie kernel: stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU#0)
Jul 27 08:34:24 dalwhinnie last message repeated 494 times
Jul 27 08:34:24 dalwhinnie kernel: eth0: card reports no resources.
====snap===
The machine is an dual 550 with 2gb RAM and twin eepro100 cards running 
2.2.16 which is patched with the appropriate Reiser FS and "Combo" patches. 
It also has an perc/2 controller running a 137.2gb (6*34gb RAID5) reiser 
formatted array.
The machine is pretty loaded chucking @10gb of data around each hour.
Any thoughts?
Regards
Martin A Brooks

The package said Windows NT 4 or better... I installed Linux.
