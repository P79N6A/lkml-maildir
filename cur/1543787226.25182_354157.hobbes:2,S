OK, I'll change that.

What IF both bits are set?  This is why we have a debounce timer to
take care of the problem :P
The way this is set up, unplugging will win out (plugging will come
first, unplugging will come and destroy 'plug's timer, and then the
unplug action will be performed on timer expiry).  Personally, I like
it this way, but I can reverse the order of these two to make plugging
the default action.  Which do you prefer?

Excellent.  I'll repost when the issues you point out have been addressed.
