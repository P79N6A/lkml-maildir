Greetings,
I ported an Object Oriented infrastructure to work with the Linux
kernel about two years ago.  For various reasons, that work was
dropped for a while.  Now, upon picking it back up again, there
are some new features that were not present in the original port
that I need to support.
Among these is a simple exception support system.  The core
of this system is based on the existence of a setjmp/longjmp
facility.  In digging through the source code, I've found a
few, architechturally specific implementations of such a
facility, but no generalized, multi-platform support.
A FAQ I found seems to suggest this deliberate, and that such
support will not ever be added to Linux.  Am I correct in
my understanding?  If so, is an architechturally specific
implementation (such as was done for ppc) acceptable?
Thanks,
John S.
