Re: IPv4 and IPv6 stack multi-FIB, scalable in the million of entries.Hi,
    We working on a edge application for aggregateing a lots of mobile (up
to 100k), then go on the backbone.  We are talking about an access
application not a core.  Each mobile can than have to talk with services we
want to provide to them.
    Our need for now, is around 100k.  But why not try to have a solution
future proof, where can scale up to a memory footprint dedicated for it.
Not limited by the architecture himself.
    Like I said before, it's not a home linux box.  It's a commercial server
serving a lots of users.  But, nothing can prevent home user to benefit from
a more scalable stack.

Gaak.
The guys at 
http://www.cidr-report.org
 are only showing 130K or so prefixes
in
the global routing table (and estimate that it could be kicked down to 90K
or
so with better CIDR aggregation.
I won't ask what sort of totally martian network design is leading to a
routing
table of millions of entries - even the "stick PMTU info into a host route"
trick
should expire routes to hosts you're not talking to, and you're probably
going
to be wanting a load balancer if you're talking to hundreds of thousands of
machines at the same time.....
