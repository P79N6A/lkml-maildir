Safe? Look, if process does not hold any spinlock and interrupts
disabled, then any distant implicit call to resched_task() silently
enables irqs. At least, this must be documented.

No, I meant process context in both scenarios! Note also, that it
happens even in UP case.

I can't see, how this can happen. Can you explain?
But it seems unrelated...
