My vision of Linux extends to people who don't have the ability, desire or
time to "man fstab" *.

Windows, somehow, detects the difference.  Whatever method used by Windows
will be the one tested by the makers of most DVD/CDROM's.
Right now the behavior is deterministic from the Kernel's point of view,
but random from the users point of view (e.g. "the last 5 DVD-ROM's I bought
just worked, this one does not work").  Can detection be automated?  How
does Windows do it?  Can Linux do it even better?
If the distinction is something that can be automated well, then what is
the argument against doing it?

* I fit under "desire".  Once I learned that udf existed (it's not in 
"man fstab"), I knew what to do.  I'd rather not know or care :-)!
