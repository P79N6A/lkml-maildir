Subject: 2.3.21 No way to boot with loadlin 1.6a

I've tried all *.S lkml patches ( included Linus one's )
but I can't boot kernel 2.3.21 with loadlin 1.6a
any hints ?
Of course 2.3.20 was fine.
Follow my RH 6.0 environment:
[root@pclucam /root]# ld -v
GNU ld version 2.9.1 (with BFD 2.9.1.0.23)
[root@pclucam /root]# gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
thanks,
luca
