When I do this, I still cannot enter unicode chars "as usual". I see
them, mutt (for example) displays everything correct with a UTF-8
locale. However, I cannot insert them correctly. When I use vim, I have
to press another key (eg. Space) 2..4 times after an umlaut was pressed,
only then the char appears.
Needless to say that the same applications work fine in X with the same
UTF-8 locale.
Regards,
Eduard.
