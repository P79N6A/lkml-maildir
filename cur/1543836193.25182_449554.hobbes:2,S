Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.33-rc3 needs to export memchr() for smbfs

Hi Marcelo,
just finished building 2.4.33-rc3 on my dual-CPU Sun U60 (works
fine BTW). I noticed that smbfs built as a module needs memchr()
since a recent fix, so this one now needs to be exported, which
this patch does.  Sources show that the lp driver would need it
too is console on LP is enabled and LP is set as a module (which
seems stupid to me anyway). I've pushed it into -upstream if you
prefer to pull from it.
Overall, 2.4.33-rc3 seems to be OK to me. I don't think that
an additionnal -rc4 would be needed just for this export (Grant
CCed in case he's wishing to do a few more builds, you know
him...  :-) ).
Regards,
Willy

Subject: [PATCH] export memchr() which is used by smbfs and lp driver.
Recently, an smbfs fix added a dependency on memchr() which is
not exported if smbfs is built as a module.
