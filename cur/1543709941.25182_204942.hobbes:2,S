Subject: [PATCH] call_usermodehelper needs to wait longer

During my testing of call_usermodehelper, I noticed that 
if it is called from a workqueue function, it does really wait
(when asked to) for the usermodehelper to exit.
Patch below should fix it. It has been tested against 2.6.4-rc2-mm1
on a 4-way x86 SMP box.
