I tend to disagree.
IMHO every selectable configuration should result in a kernel that 
compiles. Yes, it's neaarly impossible to achieve this 100%, but at 
least on i386 we are in 2.4 near to it for all not-very-obscure 
configurations.
Where's the win if you are able to select an option that doesn't 
compile? This will only cause confusion for people who compile more into 
the kernel than needed (but it does no harm).
Don't forget: The vast majorit of people compiling the kernel don't know 
anything about the internals of the kernel.
If you _really_ want to see the cmpile errors it's easy to edit the 
Kconfig file.
