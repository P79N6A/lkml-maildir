Good, this is exactly what I wanted.  How many times you tested with
this
hack without hang?  If s3 hang really goes away , then probably you can
move on , and come up with a real patch that could go into the 2.6.16. 
What do you think? :-)
The short-term proper way could be:
1. add a global variable: acpi_in_suspend.
2. in acpi_pm_prepare:
	a.call acpi_os_wait_events_complete()
	b.set acpi_in_suspend = YES.
   in acpi_pm_finish :
	set acpi_in_suspend = NO.
3. in acpi_thermal_run:
	if (acpi_in_suspend == YES)
		do nothing.
The long-term proper way should be:
1. ACPI subsystem should stop invoking BIOS before Suspend except
for several necessary AML methods that are required to put 
the platform into S3 state.  Otherwise, un-tested BIOS code path 
could cause trouble to linux, because I assume such platform 
should have been tested under windows.
