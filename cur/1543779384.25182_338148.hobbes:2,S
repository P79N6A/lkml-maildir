It's still failing on a large number of machines, but it's working on a
larger set. We (Ubuntu) shipped with suspend to RAM support in our
previous release. Frankly, at this stage the three biggest problems are:
a) resuming video (not going to be fixed in the ACPI core)
b) SATA resume (not going to be fixed in the ACPI core)
c) Motherboard chipsets that don't seem to be programmed to handle
memory refresh (not going to be fixed in the ACPI core)
People /do/ use this code, and breaking a large number of working setups
in order to fix a bug that appears on a small number of setups (and can
be worked around in a rather less invasive way) isn't sensible.
