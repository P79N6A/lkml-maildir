the pretty much only meaningful way to measure this is to:
- start a really long 'ab' testrun. Something like "ab -c 8000 -t 600".
- let the system get into 'steady state': i.e. CPU load at 100%
- reset the oprofile counters, then start an oprofile run for 60 
  seconds.
- stop the oprofile run.
- stop the test.
this way there wont be that many 'cpu_idle' entries in your profiles, 
and the profiles between the two event delivery mechanisms will be 
directly comparable.

So we are now up to epoll being 83% of kevent's performance - while the 
noise of numbers seen today alone is around 100% ... Could you update 
the files two URLs that you posted before, with the code that you used 
for the above numbers:
