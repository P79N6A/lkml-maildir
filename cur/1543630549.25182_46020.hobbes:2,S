Fibrechannel can have congestion control failures. Its not something
you see badly because scsi timeouts are incredibly conservative (often
30 seconds for a read or write). They do deal with head of queue blocking
but thats a tiny bit of it

According to folks at Quantum the IB stuff isnt doing 'true' congestion
control. At the moment its hard to tell since 1.0a doesn't deal with
congestion management and the 2.0 congestion stuff isnt due out until
later this year. Even then the Infiniband trade association folks use
words like "hopefully eliminating the congestion" in their presentation to 
describe their mechanism.
I've seen no mathematical proofs and no nice answers to the fact that FECN
has latencies and that the notification assumes the Ack packet with CA set
doesn't actually get dropped. People seem to model FECN as if the feedback
was instant whereas the feedback is one round trip on a loaded network if
the acks get back. For unreliable you end up introducing congestion 
notifications which I'm also not clear is perfect. I understand folks have
been doing the maths on this stuff though and it will be interesting to
see what they conclude
Finally for the centralised congestion manager the IBTA completely wash
their hands of policy - thats less of a problem as its mostly about telling the
boss to buy bigger toys.
TCP itself btw has issues over infiniband, stuff like convergence time,
clocking rates and window management reno style all begin to break down
at 10Gbit. On the other hand we have to solve those anyway along with other
upcoming horrors like extreme packet re-ordering.
