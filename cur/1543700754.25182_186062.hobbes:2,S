On the other hand, the synaptics touchpad on my laptop works under 
2.6.0-mm1 without the need to use the above parameter.  I don't get the 
jitter I reported for vanilla 2.6.0 synaptics support, but I do get an 
occasional small mouse jump.  
Other than that, 2.6.0-mm1 appears to be working well on my Presario 
12XL325 laptop.
