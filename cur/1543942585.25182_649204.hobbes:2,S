Or there's the complementary case of a VM_EXECUTABLE vma being
split in two, for example by an mprotect of a part of it.
Sorry, Matt, I don't like your patch at all.  It seems to add a fair
amount of ugliness and unmaintainablity, all for a peculiar MVFS case
(you've tried to argue other advantages, but not always convinced!).
And I found it quite hard to see where the crucial difference comes.
I guess it's that MVFS changes vma->vm_file in its ->mmap?  Well, if
MVFS does that, maybe something else does that too, but precisely to
rely on the present behaviour of /proc/pid/exe - so in fixing for
MVFS, we'd be breaking that hypothetical other?
I can understand patches to avoid mmap_sem for /proc/pid/exe, but
this one just seems too messy for too special an out-of-tree case.
(I've no last word on this, but that's my opinion.)
