I separated it only because cxgb3 is maintained by Jeff.  Feel free to
make it one commit.  That is the proper way IMO. But I didn't know what
SOP was for changes that hit different maintainers but are prerequisites
of each other...

I was asked to package the firmware version change along with my rdma
changes by Divy since they didn't have any other cxgb3 changes right
now.  I believe Chelsio wants folks on this new firmware asap.
