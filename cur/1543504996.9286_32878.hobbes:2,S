My experience of using Babelfish to translate into English (the only
language I'm reasonably fluent in) is that it works much better with
longer texts than shorter ones. In fact, I would say that anything
short of a dozen 80-character lines isn't worth feeding into it.
Anyway, this is off-topic here, so this will be my last comment on the
subject...
Best wishes from Riley.
