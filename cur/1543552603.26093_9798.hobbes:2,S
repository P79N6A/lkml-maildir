There is a tool to recover the whole partition table, gpart, if
your partition table is corrupt.  However, it sounds more like
just the filesystem is corrupt.

Since you have a filesystem > 500MB it will default to having 4kB blocks,
and the backup superblocks will be aligned on 32768 block boundaries.
Try "e2fsck -B 4096 -b 32768" (or 98304, 163840, 229376, 81920) to see
if that works.  I think I will submit a patch to Ted which offers more
suggestions than 8193 for backup blocks, since not too many people know
where the backups are located on more recent filesystems since they
will normally have 4kB blocks these days.
Cheers, Andreas
