I'm on gentoo here, and just copied the ck2 ebuild to ck5, and it missed
on a patch called ck-sources-2.6.IPTables-RDoS.  Any idea what this is,
and is it already in?
Con, I have no idea where it came from, but could mail it to you (I
won't post it to the list because it's not mine and I have issues about
doing such things) if you want.  I'm not sure if it applied to ck3; it
may have not existed at the time.
