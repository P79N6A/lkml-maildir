But we can't actually distribute this file under GPL because we are
not allowed to modify it.  They own the copyright, so they can release 
it
under any terms that they want.  One of their terms is that we can make
copies and give them to people.  The other term is that nobody but them
can change it.  The two aren't incompatible, but the second is anti-GPL.

Unfortunately the GPL requires that everybody has the right to *modify* 
and
distribute *modified* copies of any files released under it.  If a file 
is to be
distributed as a part of the GPLed Linux kernel must also follow GPL.
