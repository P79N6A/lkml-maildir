Note that the change to shrink_mmap to decrease the count in the while
clause, it's not fixing any deadlock.
To infinite loop the below conditions should be true:
o       none page have page->count = 1
or
o       all pages with page->count = 1 are locked
or
o       all pages with page->count = 1 and unlocked doesn't
        belong to the dma zone and the allocations wants pages
        from the dma zone
The above can never happen because we have in the DMA zone the kernel code
(at address 1M) and all the pages of the kernel have page count = 1 and
they're all unlocked.
