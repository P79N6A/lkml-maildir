That doesn't address the underlying requirement that arch specific code
should be told of change in protections.  For ia64, you are right that
it equates to flushing icache in some cases, but this API is more
generic.

I'm sure this is doable.  Though it is more of design issue of whether
that is the right way to do it.  I understand this extra API is
difficult at this time because of one single consumer.
