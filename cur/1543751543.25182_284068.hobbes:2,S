Hello
http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0021-uselib.txt
[...]
Locally  exploitable  flaws  have  been found in the Linux binary format
loaders'  uselib()  functions  that  allow  local  users  to  gain  root
privileges.

Version:   2.4 up to and including 2.4.29-rc2, 2.6 up to and including 2.6.10

It's was fixed by Marcelo on 2.4.29-rc1. Thank's :)
What about 2.6.X? Is any patch available? I don't see any changes 
around binfmt_elf in 2.6.10-bk10?
