Good.

An ostrich might reason that way too. And that is basically my main gripe.

Oh I've seen it. What I resent is the kneejerk reaction. Most people
replying obviously hadn't even looked at the source. Keith Owen's reaction
was wonderful:
	The kernel model is "get it right the first time, so we don't need
	exception handlers".  You have not given any reason why the existing
	mechanisms are failing.
Or Edgar Toernig, who also had an implementation and rejected Dan's in one
line: 
	Bad idea ...
Richard B. Johnson:
	What is this supposed to do?  Are these a bunch of solutions waiting
	for a problem? Or is my Calendar wrong?
Davide Libenzi:
	Is today the 1st of April ? You kidding, don't you ?
I mean, this is just pathetic. There is valid criticism to new ideas, but
this isn't it.
