Someone else asked this, so I'm posting to linux-kernel for all to
see.  Simply answer `Y' to CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL, then use the `ipchains'
tool; create a rule which doesn't do anything to packets, eg:
     ipchains -A input -s 192.168.1.1
And use `ipchains -L -v' to view the counters.
ipchains is part of Debian's slink, RedHat's RawHide, and usually
available from www.rustcorp.com.
Rusty.
PS. Until rustcorp.com's DNS is fixed use:
