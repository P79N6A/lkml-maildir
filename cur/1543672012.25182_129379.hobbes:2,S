CONFIG_EEPRO100=y
# CONFIG_EEPRO100_PIO is not set
# CONFIG_E100 is not set
I can test E100 again to verify if that would help.
Also, I found that if I mistyped the argument to do-kexec.sh, the
system would stay up, but the interface would get hosed, fixable with
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart.
Otherwise, kexec works fine here so far over about a dozen reboots on
both machines.
