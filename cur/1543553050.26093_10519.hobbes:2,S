Hi folks,
in my LAN there are users working on battle.net (Starcraft,
Diablo2 etc.). There is a Linux 2.2.14 box routing the LAN
with private IP addresses to the internet (with IP masqerading).
A feature that does not work is the battlecom communication. 
Is there an ip_masq module available for this (like e.g. 
ipv4/ip_masq_cuseeme.o or ipv4/ip_masq_quake.o) or is anybody
working on this?
Regards,
Gerry
