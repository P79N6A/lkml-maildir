thanks a lot for the tip !
I compiled a kernel from the "plain" 2.4.13 sources with the ac-8 patch
and it works fine.
haaa... my radeon works and I can play tuxracer; great !
more seriously, thanks to all the people making the ac kernel-variants.
Just one more -silly?- question: it seems -for me at least- that some
of the ac patches should be integrated in the kernel, why aren't they ?
(I repeat that ANY 2.4.17 variant I compiled won't even boot ! I'm not
talking about kernel panic here)
is my hardware so exotic ??
thanks again.
PS: it worked also with a 2.4.13-ac5 :-)
PPS: I don't mind to buils a few more kernel to identify which part(s)
of the ac patches is(are) responsible of this non-non-booting ;-)
situation but I need someone to guide me.
PPPS: I'll have some time in a week; tomorrow I go skiing 8-)
