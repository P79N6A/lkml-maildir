   I want to do a non-blocking read from a file, from within the kernel.
   Is this, at all, possible? I have been tracing how userspace does this,
   but the userspace does not seem to be non-blocking either.
 ...
   By looking at the code (2.3.6), there seems to be no possibility to do
   this. Am I wrong or is it not worth the effort (I might disagree) or just
   impossible?
You probably want "filp->f_flags |= O_NONBLOCK"
Later,
