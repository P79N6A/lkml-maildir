Yes, but the queued vs non-queued stuff showed up out of order.
The queued messages go through the wrong Tx path. ie. they end up
going into to NIT etc, since the deferred send uses a work queue
it wouldn't work for last-gasp messages or netdump since getting
a work queue to run requires going back to scheduler and processes
running... and it should use skb_buff_head instead
of roll your own queueing.
The other alternative would be to make the send logic non-blocking
and fully push retry to the caller.
I'll make a fix to netdump, if I can find it.
