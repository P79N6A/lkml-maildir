I can't tell you exactely what's wrong unfortunately, but after
looking at your dump & dmesg I notice two things that might be worth
trying to change :
1) You seem to be running without any swap space at all. I't usually a
good idea always to have some swap configured - try adding a swap
file.
(note: I don't think this will help with your current problem, it's
just a good thing to do generally).
2) You should try the latest stable kernel. Currently that's 2.6.16.18
(
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.16.18.tar.bz2
).
There have been lots of fixes added since 2.6.15.x and perhaps you are
lucky that whatever is giving you trouble  has already been fixed in
that kernel.

You can find some info in Documentation/sysrq.txt &
Documentation/oops-tracing.txt .
As for posting good error/bug reports, please read the REPORTING-BUGS
file in the root of the kernel source dir.
