Yes, that's called the "real world." Arguments of the "I don't need it, 
in a perfect world you wouldn't either, therefore it's a bad idea" type 
simply contribute nothing.
Because user threading can avoid context switches, there will always be 
cases where it will outperform o/s threads for hardware reasons.
