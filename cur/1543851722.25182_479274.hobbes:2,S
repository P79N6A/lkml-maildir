Hello,
it is not so easy to find online an *working* example of how to by hand
build a module.
gcc -o foo.c -ko foo.ko -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__
-I/usr/src/kernel-headers-directory/include/
with module license define macro
almost worked, but it misses thoes extra symbols created in
post-compilation.
How to add them by hand (not using all the big Makefiles normally
included in kernel tree)?
Like
some-command foo.ko foo.c
insmod foo.ko
done
