Subject: [PATCH] Add generic file support to sysfs ...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Patrick
How opposed would you be to something like this? [see inlined patch below]
Basically I am adding the ability to create short of an "attribute"
that has specific file_operations and a private pointer. The struct
generic_file contains that. Once any of the fops is called, from
the file->f_dentry->d_fsdata it is possible to get to the 'struct
generic_file', from where the 'private' pointer can be obtained
for whatever purpose.
[as a matter of fact, I could just put the 'generic_file->private'
ptr in f_dentry->d_fsdata and things would be the same].
Usage for this: I am working in this 'kue' silly thing for event
delivery, and I wanted to be able to have a /sysfs/events/ directory,
and then, on there, different files for different message queues.
Some other people around here also voiced that it'd be interesting
to have it.
Only issue I see right now is that it is left to the fops to 
do kobject_{get,put}() management of the parent. Maybe they could be 
wrapped in tin foil, do the get(), call the actual method, do the put()
and return the obtained value ... but I am not sure this is really
needed.
Need to clean up this patch, though, this is just a draft. If 
you are ok, I want to add some doc in Documentation/ and whatever
else you/anyone else might need/want.
If not ok ... why? :)
Thanks,
PS: Patch is vs. 2.5.66 ... should patch fine in others as long
as the bin support is there already.
