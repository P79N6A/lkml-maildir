Hi!
Recently I discovered that, at least under linux, my CD-ROM drive is not running at full
speed.
Details :
Abit BH-6 MB , Celeron 300A CPU
   ( intel PIIX4 IDE controller, MB chip-set is Intel-BX , I believe )
Linux kernel 2.2.6 ( on a RedHat 5.2 system )
CD-ROM is Teac CDR 532E-B as /dev/hdc.
WesternDigital Caviar 36400 is /dev/hda    ( UDMA , almost 10MB/s reads from the lower cyls )
I noticed that it read only about 2.6 MB/s at the end (faster part)  of CDs.
It operates in DMA mode, according to hdparm.
After tweaking the system with TweakBIOS and then loading linux, the speed went up 
to the expected 4.5MB/s.
I changed some timing for the secondary IDE channel in TweakBIOS, 
which is a tool for setting the hardware, it looks like the Award BIOS,
only has much more settings. Homepage : www.entechtaiwan.com
So my question is , will linux support the chipset in a way,
so that this tuning can be made from within linux ( TweakBIOS runs under DOS ) ?
