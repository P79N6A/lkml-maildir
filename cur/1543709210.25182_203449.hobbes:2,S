I wonder whats different here. Even in this case, IO did complete
with EFAULT. 
Just for argument, if the IO completed correctly (without errors) -
how would it not run into this ? io_submit_one() will call
aio_complete() is the return code is NOT -EIOCBQUEUED.
Isn't it ? How do we prevent calling aio_complete() twice ?
Thanks,
