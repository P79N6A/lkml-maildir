We use a PS/2 port, so without a reboot, this would not work. IIRC 2.6 kernels
with keyboard support compiled into the kernel cannot be forced to re-detect
the keyboard when the line was interrupted (which is a big problem with old KVM
switches). Of course, with USB keyboards this approach would work.
And if it weren't for the typical nvidia driver problems, we wouldn't allow
students to reboot the computers using the power button and let it restart the
X server instead.
