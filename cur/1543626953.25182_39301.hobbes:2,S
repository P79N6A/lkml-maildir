I think we're talking about slightly different things. I'd agree that
one call to printk is atomic, and won't get interspersed with other
things, but if we output a line via multiple calls to printk, then I 
think we have a problem. Say CPU 0 executes this bit of code:
for (i=0; i<10; i++) { printk ("%d ", i); } printk("\n");
and CPU 1 does "printk("hello\n");" then instead of getting either
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
hello
or 
hello 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
either of which would be fine, we may get
0 1 2 3 hello
4 5 6 7 8 9
which I don't think is fine - obviously the example is somewhat 
trite, but with the real instances of things that build output for one
line through multiple calls to printk, you can get unreadable garbage,
if I read the code correctly ?
