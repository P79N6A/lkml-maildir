Hi,
while looking how to fix modular FB_SAVAGE_* (both FB_SAVAGE_I2C=m and 
FB_SAVAGE_ACCEL=m are currently broken) I asked myself:
Do modular framebuffers really make sense?
OK, distributions like to make everything modular, but all the 
framebuffer drivers I've looked at parse driver specific options in 
their *_setup function only in the non-modular case.
And most framebuffer drivers contain a module_exit function.
Is there really any case where this is both reasonable and working?
