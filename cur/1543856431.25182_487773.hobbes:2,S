The HDA Intel sound driver still fails to load on my Acer Aspire 5102
notebook (Turion64 X2, ATI chipset):
Here is the PCI info while running x86_64.  I tried i386 and x86_64 and it fails
on both:

On i386 I get this after doing
        insmod snd-hda-codec.ko ;  insmod snd-hda-intel.ko

The last three lines repeat many thousands of times, followed by:
Dec  1 17:38:39 ac kernel: hda_generic: no proper input path found
Dec  1 17:38:39 ac kernel: hda_generic: no proper output path found
Dec  1 17:38:39 ac kernel: hda_generic: no PCM found
Looking at /proc/interrupts, I see exactly 110 interrupts were processed
by the driver while all this was happening:
 18:          0        110   IO-APIC-fasteoi   HDA Intel
On x86_64 I forgot to enable verbose messages, so there's less information
but it fails the same way.
