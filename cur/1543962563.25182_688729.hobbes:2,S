I dunno.  Return-by-reference is a bit nasty and forces the compiler to
generate extra code to put local storage into a stack slot rather than
keeping it in a register.
Does anyone actually test whether hex_to_foo returns -1?  Probably not
many.
In which case it might be better to do
u64 hex_to_u64(const char *buf);
and, if we encounter a non-hex char, do a WARN_ON(1).
One could legitimately do
	int c = hex_to_int(some_user_input);
	if (c < 0) {
		printk("user: you're an idiot\n");
	}
to perform validation and conversion in a single operation but I expect
that such code is in the minority, and could be covered by running a separate
bool is_hex_string(const char *bug, size_t nchars);
beforehand?
