But they were already broken.
And the patch actually helps here.
See the following table:
                                          Current kbuild                With patch
simple module, no grepping
kernel source + output mixed                  OK                           OK
simple module, no grepping
kernel source separate from output            FAIL *1                      OK
module grepping in src
kernel source + output mixed                  OK                           OK
module grepping in src
kernel source separate from output            FAIL *2                      FAIL *3
FAIL *1	Module cannot build because it fails to locate the compiled files used for kbuild.
        Also the kernel configuration is missing.
FAIL *2 Same as FAIL *1. Module cannot build because kbuild compiled files are missing and
        it cannot access kernel configuration.
        Also it fails to locate files when grepping.
FAIL *3 Grep will fail because it try to grep in files located under build/
The above table clearly shows that this patch fix building external modules in the
case where no grepping were preformed.
And the error were simplified in the last case.
So improvements all over.
What one should realise is that the patch makes it less painfull when kernels
are build using the separate output directory option.
And when that feature is not used - no change in behaviour occur.
