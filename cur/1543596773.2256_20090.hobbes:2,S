No, but that doesn't appear to be the problem.  The patchlet below
fixes^Wmakes it work ok without ooming, whether I have swap enabled

Rik.  Kswapd should check oom even if there is no inactive shortage,
else you get livelock when you can't scrub instead of kaboom.  Maybe
a count of loops before killing things, but IMHO a check is needed.
