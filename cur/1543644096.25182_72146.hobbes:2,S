You didn't read the post carefully.
They started and waited for 100,000 threads.
They did not have them all running at the same time. I think the
original post said something like "up to 50 at a time".
Basically, the benchmark was how _fast_ thread creation is, not now many
you can run at the same time. 100k threads at once is crazy, but you can
do it now on 64-bit architectures if you really want to.
