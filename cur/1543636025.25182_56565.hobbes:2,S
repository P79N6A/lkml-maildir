I'm in violent agreement that it should go into 2.4 *now that it is merged
in 2.5*.  You may have noticed that Marcelo has been occupied with a few
other issues (VM, IDE).

I'm not asking you to do it on your Solaris boxen -- I couldn't give a
damn about slow, buggy Solaris I'm asking whether you have tested this
on ext2/ext3 with/without dirsync.  The gentlemanly thing to do when asking
for a change to the kernel is to (honestly) assess its impact.

Cheating benchmarks -- bah!  Safety for *one* (naive) application class!
dirsync buys me no useful safety on my build host, all it will do is
slow down things like rpmbuild --rebuild.
This is all rather silly.  An MTA requires configuration, so what is
the difficulty in using -o dirsync, or alternatively, and quite a bit
more simply, executing chattr +D on the spool directory.  It's quite
simple: put dirsync in the kernel and tools, then add chattr +D to the
post-install scripts for your favorite package manager.
