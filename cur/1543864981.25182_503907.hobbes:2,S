Along with "Message-ID: <20070131093542.GA3471@flower.upol.cz>" -- yes.
Note, that they also make a little bit of cleanup to top makefile's mess,
And, i think, have more elegant, portable, clean solution.
Roman commented on another my patch, saying, that tilde in the end isn't
the only way to name backups. Filename, containing '~' is a backup in the
sources, thus i'm proposing new patch.
Unfortunately still no more comments from anybody. Roman joined, but
seems busy now, to comment on such minor stuff.
Anyway, thanks.
