D'oh!  How embarrassing..

It might be caused by a bug, in a sense.  The detection code in 2.3 checks
for a common bug in Intel chipsets.  See parport_EPP_supported (in
parport_pc.c) for more details, or David Campbell's id_probe, which is
where the logic came from.
Basically, ECP+EPP is to be avoided, or at least so I'm told.
