I never argued with this. And, let me repeat. I am not arguing against
waitfd! Actually, I always try to avoid the "do we need this feature"
discussions.
What I disagree with is that waitfd adds the functionality which does
not exists currently.

Cough. You don't have to explain me why signalfd is nice ;) I participated
in discussion when it was created.

That is what I meant. Not more.

Indeed. We use read() only to wait for the signal death.

Nice argument to add the new syscall ;)

Heh. I also don't like this ;) A reason for waitfd ?

I could blaim waitfd because it fills siginfo in the manner which
is not compatible with signalfd, despite logically the same structure.

Can't understand... waitfd doesn't clear the signal too?
And you forget to mention another drwaback with the current code:
a lot of pathetic comments ;)

Yes, sure, indeed, of course.

Huh.

Well, I think this is off-topic, and more importantly I don't think
this change is possible.

Yes, the user-space code (for this particular artificial example)
becomes simpler. Following this logic, let's add sys_copyfile()
to kernel? From time to time I regret we don't have it...

Scott, this is unfair. Yes, some arches do not implement restore_sigmask()
logic. So what? Let's suppose ppoll() has a bug. So, this means we should
add waitfd? No, let's fix ppol(), and waitfd is orthogonal. Imho.
Again, again, again. Please don't forget about "I am not arguing against".
But I don't buy your arguments.
Oleg.
