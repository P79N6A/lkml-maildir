I'm sorry I can't get to the machine now till Tuesday. I'll try to get it 
into a smaller font, or failing that a serial console if you like.
I've posted e100.{,k}o, vmlinux and System.map to the above URL. FWIW, 
they both give "c010e840 T apply_alternatives". I've also posted ".config" 
which Apache elects not to list :)
Does any of the above help?
