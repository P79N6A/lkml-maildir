I had some problem too, but not commented because it was not
reproducible.

Yes, klogd died on me --- there where a rogue ftpd (connection from a
win95 box that died, ftpd stayed around, 64Mbyte size but it seemed
"quiet") --- than I had to reboot --- they were switching off power in
the office, and could not do more investigations... never occured
again. 
Sometime --- blocked sendmail connections to localhost 
on pipe_write or pipe_read, for a long time. Then they resumes. 
Neverthless, 2.2.2 is running quite good here. So not so much as a
"development kernel", but yes, tere is some little sharp corner 
in it :)) 
Bye,
