To put credits right I just ported the functionality of the two scripts
developed by Keith Owens (reference_init.pl and reference_discarded.pl)
to modpost so the check is run each time moduels are build. All errors
introduced in the process are mine.
The scripts are kept for now so one can double check.
I had in mind to fix some of the easier ones but work is hindering it
atm.
For now it gives a warning when a drivers uses module_parm_array() and
uses __initdata for parameters. This is a false warning - at least if
sysfs attribute is '0'. Hope to look into this later.
