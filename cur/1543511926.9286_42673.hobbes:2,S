This can be handled Solaris style with a slight modification
to devfs.  In compatability mode, devfs can report the major and
minor number pairs associated with each device.
This information can be used with a currently hypothetical
"builddev" to populate and verify ownership and
permissions on /dev using device nodes.  This does
nothing for the Major/Minor number problem, that still
needs to be dealt with seperately, but it does directly
address most of the remaining objections.  It also 
provides a place to kill a lot of the /proc pollution
we have been getting since 1.3.x. In addition it obsoletes
/dev/MAKEDEV for systems where it is in use, simplifying
the job of writing a new driver by one step.
For a static system this program only needs to be run
when you would run "boot -r" on Solaris, for a dynamic
system in can be run continually or at every reboot (depending
on the particulars of the system).  It can also use either
the devfsd config file, existing permissions in /dev, or
a combination of the two to set permissions.
It allows "policy" for the /dev directory to be set _entirely_
in userspace, it allows dynamic creation _and_removal_
of devices as needed, and it does the jig on Sundays.
Anyone got a problem with this?
