I agree that sync/async is not too much of a difference when you do a memcpy
behind, so you can just have wrappers. I am still not convinced that it
will stay
reasonably small with all that duplicated stuff, but since it's easy to
do I just
gonna give it a try to see how it'll look alike. Bet the patch size will
double.
