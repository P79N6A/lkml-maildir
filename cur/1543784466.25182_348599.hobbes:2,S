x86_64 kdb does have the code to follow them, it's pretty much the same.
(kdb does have a bug in its x86_64 setjmp with framepointers, but that's
irrelevant to whether the x86_64 kernel supports framepointers.)

In an ideal and bloat-neutral world.  I've always imagined it to be
quite a lot of work, bringing in its own set of problems: but great
that that work has now been done, and yes, it might one day get
ported to kdb.  But removing "&& !X86_64" is much easier.
