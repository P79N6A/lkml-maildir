I see, but I didn't mean _this_ is bug. Please see below.

In that case the patch doesn't make the difference, because if the
task runs in the global namespace then
	task_pgrp_nr(current) == task_pgrp_vnr(current);

And now we have a problem afaics, because without this patch ->oz_pgrp
does not necessary match the pid of automount.
Let's look at
	static inline int autofs_oz_mode(struct autofs_sb_info *sbi) {
		return sbi->catatonic || task_pgrp(current) == sbi->oz_pgrp;
	}
Please note that task_pgrp(current) is "struct pid *", not pid_t.
It does not belong to any particular namespace, it "represents" all
namespaces this task is visible in, up to global.
Let's suppose automount starts in the level 2 namespace.
It's pgrp == 10 in the global namespace, and at the same time
it is == 20 from automount->nsproxy->pid_ns pov.
We need sbi->oz_pgrp == task_pgrp(automount).
But, by default parse_options() sets pgrp == 10, this is what
task_pgrp_nr(current) == task_pgrp_nr_ns(current, init_pid_ns)
returns.
Now autofs_fill_super() does sbi->oz_pgrp = find_get_pid(10).
This means: find the pid which has the numeric value == 10
in our namespace == automount->nsproxy->pid_ns.
But we should use 20, not 10. Otherwise we get the wrong pid or
NULL.
In short. Let's suppose automount(8) startes within the
pid namespace, and there is no "pgrp=" parameter. Then,
Before the patch
	sbi->oz_pgrp != task_pgrp(automount)
After the patch
	sbi->oz_pgrp == task_pgrp(automount)
And please note that these "!="/"==" apply to any namespace. I mean,
when we call autofs_oz_mode() it does not matter in which namespace
autofs_oz_mode() is executed, we compare "struct pid*", not pid_t.
Ian, please let me know if I am answering the wrong question,
I am not sure I understand you.
Oleg.
