Aehhm, you are completely on the wrong track! I installed 2.6.11.7 the same way I installed 2.6.11, with sound support statically included, but, though it worked fine without ACPI under 2.6.11, the same configuration under 2.6.11.7 does not work. There was no change in practise, only a change in behaviour.
