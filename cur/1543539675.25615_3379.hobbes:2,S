Hi
i to have the same problem i asked about this before in
numerous places and always got the same response
tcp is fine when it uses the old ip address becuase
it will die and timeout by its self but with udp
it will not nor does it die when the interface
goes done and it also does use the new ip address
from an interface like ppp0 even when
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr = 1
it has been like this since i started running a nameserver
behind a MASQing computer this was since about 2.2.10 or so
how i managed to get around it was to set the timeout on udp
packets to 1 second and bring up and interface dummy0 so the
next packet will make the MASQ entry go away when ppp0 comes up
all works again
i had problems that when i did not do this udp packets could 
come from the nameserver often enough so that the MASQ entry's
timeout was always refreshed to 2 minutes hence never using 
the new ip address
are there anyother ways around this the method i use
still fails sometimes
thanks
