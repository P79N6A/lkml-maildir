Forgot to tell, my kmem_cache_destory is just robust against freeing a
slab header that has still some object allocated (not yet
kmem_cache_freed) in it. If there are still objects queued you get a
different retval from kmem_cache_destory and the slab header won't be
destroyed. It will also printk a kernel error. That will allow us to catch
bugs and the code may do some recover action at runtime looking the
retval.
