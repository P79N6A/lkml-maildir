heh, I must say that the ones I've seen haven't been very useful.
However...  Given the amount of time I (and others, to a lesser extent)
spend complaining about and scratching heads over crappy changelogs, we
would benefit from having a standard changelog template.
Something which guides people to creating a good changelog.  But it
would have to be short, and carefully written.  It should learn from
history, to wit:
- ./REPORTING-BUGS has a template and afaik it has never elicited any
  useful information.
- Documentation/SubmittingPatches has info on how to write a
  changelog, and people blithely ignore it.
- kerneldoc provide a template of sorts, and we see that filling out
  templates puts people's brains into "filling out a template" mode,
  rather than into "communicating information" mode.
An interesting problem.
