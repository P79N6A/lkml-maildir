I've not looked at what it would take to do that, nor what measures
are currently in place, *at all*, but as I see it, all it would take
would be some "tag" present for each message stating if it was "build
in", or "currently loaded as a module", then on each module load check
the "tag" of the to-be-loaded module against the list of current
in-kernel tags, then reject if already on the list.
I can't see why there would be a catch...
