Yep, at the cost of increasing the total amount of computation
required: you now have to compute the outer D layers of each of your
neighbours, too.  Total work on each node goes up from N**3 to
(N+2D)**3.  Ouch, that looks nasty.
This might be a workaround, but it's not a generic solution.  For
special cases where the domain density is extremely high and so D<<N,
it can improve performance somewhat.
