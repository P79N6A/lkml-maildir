Or doing double kunmaps, or doing a kunmap_atomic() on the page, not the
address. I've seen both of those end up triggering that BUG_ON() in a
later kmap.
Looking over the 2.6.22..2.6.23-rc1 diff, I found one such error in
ocfs2 at least. But you are probably not using that, so I'll keep
looking...

[PATCH] ocfs2: bad kunmap_atomic()
kunmap_atomic() takes the virtual address, not the mapped page as
