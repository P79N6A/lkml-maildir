that's right, i did.  and given that it was a trivial, aesthetic patch
but a couple "git pull" cycles went by without it being applied, i
figured i might as well submit it again.
quite honestly, at this point, given that it's this much trouble to
fix a freaking comment in a single file, i'm seriously losing interest
in wasting any more of my time at this.  life is just too short to
volunteer unpaid labour that just gets dropped on the floor because
you don't know the secret handshake.
