So you just ignored my letter on that subject :(
The fact that you don't need it doesn't mean that other people won't.
The fact that there's no clean way to suspend USB doesn't mean that 
there shouldn't be one for SPI.

So driver->suspend is going to be called 3 timer with SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN 
parameter, right?
I'm afraid that won't work :(
Especially in our case, where we *do need* preparation steps that are 
taken in *normal* suspend sequence - i. e. we need to set up the wakeup 
credentials for the *SPI* since the wakeup's gonna happen from a call 
incoming through the network module residing on the SPI bus!
