At one time there was a per-user accounting patch, but it was dropped,
because it was deemed an unnecessary additional compexity.
max_user_mounts is analogue to files_stat.max_files (which is a sysctl
tunable also), and it's purpose is really to make sure that a user is
not able to create an insane number of mounts, and not to acurately
limit normal usage.
So I'm not sure a per-container or per-user count is really needed.

Just to check, why I got that (EPERM or whatever) error for the mount
command.

No, I don't think such corner cases really matter in this case.

Yeah, maybe some of the patches should be folded together.  If a
resubmit is necessary I'll look into that.
