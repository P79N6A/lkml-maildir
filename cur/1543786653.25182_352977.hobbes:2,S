This is partially due to the netfilter hooks that are registered (so we
always take nf_hook_slow() in the NF_HOOK() macro).
The default policies inside an iptables chain are internally implemented
as a rule.  Thus, policies as built-in rules have packet/byte counters.
Therefore, without making a semantic change, we cannot do any of the
following optimizations:
1) not take a lock when the chain is empty
2) not register at the netfilter hook when the chain is empty.
This is well-known, but I don't think we can change the semantics for
the user during a stable kernel series.  That's one point where not
having 2.7.x really hurts.
