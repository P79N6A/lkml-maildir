When you don't have one at all.  Look at the fcntl case a few
patches later, or even the spawnpid case.  It simplifies things to
just cope with the fact that sometimes the users just have a NULL
pointers.
Then of course there is the later chaos when we get to pid spaces
where depending on the pid namespace you are in when you call this
on a given struct pid sometimes you will get a pid value and sometimes
you won't.
