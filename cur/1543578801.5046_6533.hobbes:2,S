Ok. Should I keep reporting new syslog messages as they appear ? This
machine has lots of traffic, both TCP (SMTP) and UDP (DNS). Since the
last email I also got (minus the "Undo loss" ones, and I only included one
of each message types, as they repeat):
Undo partial loss 193.230.129.57/33659 c1 l5 ss2/3 p5
udp v4 hw csum failure.
