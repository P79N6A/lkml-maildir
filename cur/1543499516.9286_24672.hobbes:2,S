  subject:  Program tracing.
  Sirs:
  Can anyone tell me how to start a program file (typically an ELF file)
  and halt its execution just before the first instruction of the
  program?  The facility must work even for programs that have no tracing
  compiled in.
  I have written a Linux debugger similar to Quaid Analyzer for DOS
  that uses ptrace to display memory and registers, including disassembling
  the code.  The last feature I need is getting control just before
  the first instruction of a process.
  DOS and Windows provided this ability, through an undocumented
  but easily discovered system call.  As far as I can tell, the ability
  is not provided in gdb.  I earlier struck out trying to get an
  answer through the Red Hat developers mailing list.
  As an aside, I have found that the specification for ptrace, distributed
  with Linux and widely reproduced on the internet, is erroneous in
  some respects.  Is there any place to post a corrected document and
  get it included in the distribution?
  I only subscribe to the digest, so a separate cc would be helpful.
