To implement the master enable/disable switch they want. The messages
don't get send out anyway but why bother doing all the work if nothing
will get send out in the end? It implements a well defined flag
controlled by open/close on fds (thus handles dying applications)
stating whether the whole code should be enabled or disabled. It is of
course not needed to avoid sending unnecessary messages.
