setsockopt i.e. set socket options
I think that Andrea's point is that SIOCPUSH don't set anything (i.e.
don't change a state), but ask for an action to be done now.
For this reason the name setsockopt is counter intuitive (apart from man
page) and it seems to violate the principle of least surprise.
I think this point of view is easily agreeable.
