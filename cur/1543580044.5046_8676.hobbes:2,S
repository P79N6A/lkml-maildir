No, but that's really interesting..

Your "link" values are in the range 1-4. Which makes perfect sense, but
that's absolutely _not_ what the Linux SiS routing code expects (the code 
seems to expect them to be ASCII 'A' - 'D').
It looks very much like "pirq_sis_get()" and "pirq_sis_set()" in
arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c are broken for your setup.
Can you replace them with the following:
	static int pirq_sis_get(struct pci_dev *router, struct pci_dev *dev, int pirq)
	{
		if (pirq <= 4) {
			u8 x;
			pci_read_config_byte(router, 0x40+pirq, &x);
			return (x & 0x80) ? 0 : (x & 0xf);
		}
		printk("Unknown SiS pirq value %d\n", pirq);
		return 0;
	}
and
	static int pirq_sis_set(struct pci_dev *router, struct pci_dev *dev, int pirq, int irq)
	{
		if (pirq <= 4) {
			pci_write_config_byte(router, 0x40 + pirq, irq);
			return 1;
		}
		printk("Unknown SiS pirq value %d\n", pirq);
		return 0;
	}
and see if that changes the behaviour. 
Anybody else with SiS chipsets that want to try the above? Please..
