Yes, that's better from a code staging/reviewing pov.
But there's a practical problem: if I put the patch in -mm for testing, and
the ocfs2 guys put the patch into their git tree for their testing, I get
rejects.  So I drop the core patch from -mm again.  If the ocfs guys _dont_
put the patch into their tree, they need to add this additional patch for
their testing.  It's all screwed up.
So for both -mm and for the ocfs2 team, leaving the patch in the ocfs2 git
tree is the most convenient place for it.
Obviously, merging it into Linus's tree will fix up everyone's patching
problems, but it has no users at this time...
