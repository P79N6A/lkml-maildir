It's pretty much the same, with a couple of small changes.  After
forward porting your patch and the one from AA's patches (hch says that
one was actually done by Ihno Krumreich, thanks for the info), I added
the fix from (c) for the race, and moved the check for if(flags &
CLONE_IDLETASK) outside of get_pid into copy_process() since there's no
need to call get_pid and return just to find out that we need to use 0.
