Greetings,
Reason for posting/sending this email.
1. the actual message:
pppoe[1857]: Linux select bug hit! This message is harmless, but please 
ask the Linux kernel developers to fix it.
I connect to the InterNet via my ADSL provider. From time to time, my 
adsl connection dies and following it, i receive a message in my logs 
concerning a Linux bug hit.
I'm using N_HDLC line discipline for synchronous mode.
The adsl daemon is provided by the rp-pppoe package. If for any reasons, 
anyone on this list wishes to look in further, please contact me, so 
that i can provide them with accurate information. Perphaps concerning 
the adsl scripts, log information, etc. I'm obviously not at your level, 
but please critize this.
Al Castro
