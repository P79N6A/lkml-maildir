Yep. Look at POWER5, 2 cores on a die sharing a l2 cache and 2 threads
on each core. On top of that you have the higher level NUMA
characteristics of the machine. So we need SMT as well as (potentially)
2 levels of NUMA. The overhead of enabling multi levels of NUMA may
outweigh the gains, we need to do some analysis.
Looks like a lot of the other architectures are going multi core multi
thread...
(HT is an intel trademark for what boils down to being SMT)
