Crazy ideas :
Could we do something along the lines of the thread local storage ?
Or could we map a per-thread page that would contradict this
"definition" ?
Or can we move down the beginning of the user-space thread stack of 4
bytes (it's already put at a random address anyway) and use these 32
bits to put our variable ? We don't care if userspace also modifies it;
the kernel would blindly increment it, so there would be no security
concerns involved.
