Thanks for the hint. This seems to make things a little better, but I'm
still far away from 2.4 performances. I thought that anticipatory sched
could be part of the problem, and booting with elevator=deadline
does a little better... but using 2.4 is completely another thing.
By the way, -a 512 vs -a 8 is a kernel "change" or an hdpam one?
