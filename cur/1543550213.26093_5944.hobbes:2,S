I have been thinking about adding this for some time.  Post mortem
analysis of multi-threaded programs is a Good Thing(tm).  I haven't
heard any news on whether anyone has started implementation of the
ideas kicked around on this list with regards to the thread group ID.
It seemed like a good kernel compromise to bring Linux up to speed
with other OSs.  I should probably get on the glibc mailing list as
well since there would have to be some changes made there to make
things work properly.
