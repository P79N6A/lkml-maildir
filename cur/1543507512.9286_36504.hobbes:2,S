Not sure if all is clear (as you say my script may not terminate on a
possible dialing error), the error is not fatal. When i setup a
connection everything works fine, then, after a 30 seconds, i get this
error in my log - still the connection works perfectly.
Any idea's how to find out what it wrong exactly? And on what side
(myself or ISP)? Any idea? All works fine, but i don't like errors.
Thanx in advance, -Rejo.
