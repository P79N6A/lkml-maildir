The basic idea is "everything which can be a module will be a module", 
even scsi is a module. And if you use grub, it's 100% transparent as the
initrd
will be automatically added to the grub config when you install the RH
kernel rpm;
even if you use lilo the initrd is supposed to be made for you
automatically.
