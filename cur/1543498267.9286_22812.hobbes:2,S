Hi,
I have a laptop with a NE2000 compatible PCMCIA card. In the PCMCIA
configuration, I have excluded IRQ 3,4,7 (being careful) and 5
(sound chip). The network card used to grab IRQ 9 and live happy
ever after since Linux 2.0.31 or so.
Until I upgraded from 2.3.2 to 2.3.5. After some testing with
pcmcia-cs 3.0.1[0-2] I found out that the card didn't get any
interrupts. So I excluded IRQ 9 from the configuration. After a
restart the card grabbed IRQ 10 and is now happy again.
What could have caused this problem?
Thanks,
hjb
