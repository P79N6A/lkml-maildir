the "traffic policing" entry in that list refers specifically to the
config option "CLS_NET_POLICE" in net/sched/Kconfig:
config NET_CLS_POLICE
        bool "Traffic Policing (obsolete)"
        depends on NET_CLS_ACT!=y
        select NET_ESTIMATOR
        ---help---
          Say Y here if you want to do traffic policing, i.e. strict
          bandwidth limiting. This option is obsoleted by the traffic
          policer implemented as action, it stays here for compatibility
          reasons.
so ... does "obsolete" really mean "obsolete"?
