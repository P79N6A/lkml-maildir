You say this with the all the dogma of someone working with code that 
currently does things a particular way.  You provide no reasons though.

Oh, this means a much more complicated interface, and it means that the 
VM must take into account the optimizations of each and every 
filesystem.  Are you sure this isn't an unmaintainable centralized hell? 
In practice, will it really mean that optimizations specific to a 
particular filesystem will get ignored, because there will be too many 
of them to keep up with, and they will clutter each other up if 
implemented in one piece of code?  Will programmers really be able to 
experiment?

Say more about what you mean by better throttling on dirty pages, and 
how that meets the needs of slum squeezing, transaction committing, 
write clustering, etc.  Last I remember, the generic write clustering 
code in VM didn't even understand packing localities.;-)
