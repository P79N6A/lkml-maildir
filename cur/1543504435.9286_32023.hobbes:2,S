I experienced exactly the same problem on 2.2.5 kernel, with
WDC AC313000R drive (EIDE) running on PIIX4 chipset.
I first thought I had done some bad configuration (probably UDMA
part) with hdparm utility which caused some hardware to break,
but it turned out that nothing was broken when I checked the drive
with verification tool supplied from Western Digital.
This problem went away after I turned off UDMA66 mode by tweaking
default mode of the drive set in the HDD BIOS, changing the mode
to "always-UDMA33" mode. Of course, I had to reformat the partition
and re-install everything, but since then, no problem whatsoever.
Hope this helps.
