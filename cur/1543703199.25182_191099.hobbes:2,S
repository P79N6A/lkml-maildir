Hi.
I think you'll find that the 'bad: scheduling while atomic' reports are
completely unrelated to whether the drivers works after suspend or not;
they simply reflect that drivers_resume is being called with
preempt_count > 0 (IRQs/preempt not reenabled after copying the image or
fpu not released).
Regards,
Nigel
