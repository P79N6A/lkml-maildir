mmap(2) with a "valid" hint (so with enough space in the hole between
'start' and 'start+len') runs with O(log(N)) complexity because it uses
the tree internally to verify that's a valid hole. It's only the search
of an hole that has O(N) complexity, the "check" of one hole has just
O(log(N)) complexity.
