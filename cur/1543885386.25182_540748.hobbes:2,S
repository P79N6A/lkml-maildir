One can come close.  It would make sense to say that after a flush,
subsequent reads should retrieve _contiguous_ bytes from the input stream.  
In other words, rule out the possibility that the read would get bytes
1-10 (from some buffer somewhere) followed by bytes 30-60 (because bytes
11-29 were dropped by the flush).  By contrast, it would be permissible
for the read to obtain bytes 20-60, even though 20-29 may have been
entered the input stream before the flush occurred.

This is of course the fly in the ointment.
