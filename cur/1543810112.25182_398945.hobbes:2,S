Actually, it won't happen.  There's already logic in there to help pdflush,
kswapd and memory-allocating tasks avoid blocking on congested queues. 
It's trivial to extend that to avoidance of hotunplugged queues.
Things like sync(), fsync(), O_SYNC and reads will necessarily block.
We may or may not decide to block on page-dirtyings.  Again, that's trivial
to do in balance_dirty_pages().
Race conditions are pretty much unavoidable - if someone goes and disables
a device when we're partway through and committed to I/O submission then
things will get very sticky.  But we can have a pretty successful solution
to all of this without a ton of effort.
But this is all the easy part.
