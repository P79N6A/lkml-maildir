I'm mostly just curious, what exactly happens when a second process
opens and mmaps the file at this point? Will it also see the new length
with the old data, or will that invalidate the mapping and pull the new
data off of the server?
Also what happens if the process had a shared mapping and dirtied the
page (f.i. it wrote a byte to to offset 0) but the update hasn't yet
been written back, will it end up committing the (stale) data from the
local copy of the page but with the updated length=10 back to the server?
