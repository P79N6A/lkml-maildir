Subject: Accessing device information in REMOVE agent

I'd like to be notified when block device goes away (e.g. USB stick unplugged) 
basically to look if device is in use and possibly initiate clean up. Block 
hotplug currently is passing only DEVPATH; but it alone is not reliable way 
to identify it; device may be used under alias names via symbolic links.
Is it safe to access /sys/$DEVPATH in REMOVE agent? Apparently hotplug is 
called asynchronously i.e. it is possible that /sys entry is already removed?
Would it make sense to add device number? It seems to be natural native "block 
device ID" :)
TIA
