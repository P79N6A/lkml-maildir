btw, I thought about adding the load average too but it wasn't really
interesting, since sometime a server is stressed a lot for a few minutes
and then goes back to idle mode. A kernel bug will not necessairly
trigger because some app is I/O bound all the time. Certainly more load
is a factor that increases the probability of bugs and race conditions
though, it's just not obvious how to assign a 0/100% score to a certain
KLive "session".

crontab really is easy and standard, crontab seems actually the only way I
could really write the few liner autoinstall script.
