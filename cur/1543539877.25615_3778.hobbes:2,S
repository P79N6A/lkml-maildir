Any of what I listed are possible reasons.  The password protect for
Jaz drives mentioned elsewhere in this thread is an actual, real-life
example.  You said that sounded like a bad implementation -- but there
is no way to do that within the standard-defined commands.

If you assume hot swappable hardware, yes.  That's a big assumption.
Would you require a reboot for 90+% of the market simply because they
don't pay several times more for their hardware?

The only coherent point I've seen Andre make is that the drive should
check the vendor-specific commands it receives to make sure they are
sane (as in checking a signature for a firmware update).  ATA
extensions are not just about repairs or diagnostics -- they can
easily be about day-to-day operations that must not require a reboot.

If your RAM vendor said that you could void the warranty by storing
the text string "magic ju-ju beans" into it, would you believe them?
Would you want to add microcode to your processor just in case
somebody tried to put that string into RAM?
Making vague claims about voiding warranties doesn't help the
discussion.  If the drive vendor wishes to forbid user firmware
upgrades, they can simply make that available only through physical
modification of the drive (which would void the warranty in itself).
If they want the host CPU to update their firmware, they'd better be
prepared for all that entails.

Yes, except his proposal came across as rather confused to me.  Not
least because he persistently misspelled "vendor" as "vender" and
implied that all vendor-specific commands can damage the hardware or
render the drive inoperable (which, after a little thought, or given
the Jaz write-password example, is an invalid assumption).
Maybe the T13 standards committee will clarify the proposal before
endorsing it.  Maybe they won't endorse it at all.  Either way, it
is not the responsibility of the kernel to police what applications
send to a raw I/O interface they requested to use (and for which
they had permissions as the kernel knows permissions).
