hip hip horray!  Getting mismatched kernels to be supported was a long
discussion.
I suspect the reason for the matching kernel from the distros is just
that everything is quite new so they don't want to wonder if you old
kernel has all of the appropriate support, and by that point they can
probably assume the shipped kernel works.

At that level I would say that below 32M is where you start dealing with
custom built programs, instead of slapping a bunch of utilities inside
a ramdisk.  I suspect with a little care you could get a few K user
space executable and fit everything inside of 4M.  But I don't know if anyone
is that ambitious yet.
