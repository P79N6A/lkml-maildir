hehe, this is exactely where cpufreqd needs some work as it doesn't
distinguish between UP and MP currently, it just applies the same
cpufreq policy  to all available processors.
But I'm already working on this.

cpufreqd has no problems here.

yes, cpufreqd needs some work on this, but it will be easily handled
once 1) is done and anyway it is't that bad here currenlty, it will
just write to both .../cpu0 and .../cpu1 the same profile.

Oh, there's the ondemand governor for this. 
A little digression though just to point out that cpufreqd works
differently from cpuspeed, speedfreq et al.
It collects system status data (acpi/apm/pmu data, cpu load,
sensors data,...) and applies a cpufreq policy based on user defined
rules (eg: when battery is between 5% and 50% and ac is unplugged run
with ondemand @ 40%-70% - quite like the old speestep applet I found on
win2k on this laptop some years ago).
No best frequency caclulation is done, too many parameters and for just
the cpu load we have the excellent ondemand governor.
Thanks for the useful insight!
