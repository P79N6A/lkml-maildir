The thing is, since it gets free'd before all users have let go of their 
pointers to it, I'd expect people to now have a pointer to a _totally_ 
stale entry somewhere.
Although I guess in 99% of all cases there just won't be any other users
for the new dentry in particular (it might be different if it was the old
dentry that got dropped too much), and clearly it hasn't been noticed for
the last 20 months.
Even so, I'm a bit surprised. But I obviously applied the patch.
