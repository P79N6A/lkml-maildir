Patches look fine. Some of the helper stuff could be moved to
asm-generic, but that can still be done later. The headers really need
some serious cleanup in this area, the dependencies are damned fragile.
I8 still have a completely untested patch to convert the thread flags to
bitmasks, but I hadn't much time for m68k hacking lately...
