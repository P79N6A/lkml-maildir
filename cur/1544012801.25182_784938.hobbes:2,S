Your result is very interesting.
level 2 is more fast and efficient of power.
What's major contributor to use less time in level 2?
I think it's cache bounce is less time than old.
Is right ?
I want to test SCHED_MC but I don't know what you use to benchmark about power.
How do I get the data about 'Package, Idle, Energy, Power'?
