It makes it easy for people who build a lot of different kernel  
versions and patchsets with similar configs.  When compiling a kernel  
for "aphrodite", I use my "config.aphrodite4" which has  
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-aphrodite4".  I may patch the kernel first with  
-mm or another patchset for testing which modify EXTRAVERSION, and  
with the localversion change I get the following kernels, depending  
only on patchset and my config:
/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-aphrodite4
/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-mm4-aphrodite4
[...etc...]

Somone asked me why I work on this free (

philosophy/) software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Schulz  
had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."
