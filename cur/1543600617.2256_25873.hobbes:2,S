No.

No.
The NFS layer knows nothing at all about the network. It relies on the
RPC layer to handle all that for it. There are 2 ways in which it can
do this:
  1) keep the NFS layer in the dark (using the 'hard' mount option)
  2) pass an error back which then propagates back through NFS to the
     user (the 'soft' mount option).
Cheers,
