Hi,
Just booted up 2.2.20pre1 and am getting some funny
results.  The system boots but is very slow.  Every few
seconds I get:
Stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU#0)
Booting vanilla 2.2.19 works fine.  The machine is an
Intel Pentium III 850MHZ on an Abit VP6 board.  If any
further information is needed, let me know.
Regards,
Shane
