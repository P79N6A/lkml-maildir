Having trouble getting 2.6.12-mm1 to compile on my x86 test
boxes other than a basic PC.  I suspect this patch is to 'blame'.

We seem to need to include setup-bus.o for most x86 architectures
regardless of HOTPLUG.  Not sure if this is the right fix, but it
seems to work on the systems I have tested.

It seems that X86 architectures in general need the setup-bus.o
not just those with HOTPLUG.  This avoids the following error on
X86_NUMAQ and x86_64:
    arch/i386/pci/built-in.o(.init.text+0x15a6): In function `pcibios_init':
    : undefined reference to `pci_assign_unassigned_resources'
