I think this patch is missing an IFDEF or something (I'm not really a
programmer, I just like to pretend).  Anyway, I've tried building -ck2
without swap enabled, and it failed.  Just to make sure, I make'd
distclean, and I get the following:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
mm/built-in.o: In function `zone_watermark_ok':
mm/page_alloc.c:763: undefined reference to `delay_prefetch'
mm/built-in.o: In function `swap_setup':
mm/swap.c:485: undefined reference to `prepare_prefetch'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
