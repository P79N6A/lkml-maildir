I do not disagree with this. 
But at the moment asm/pgtable.h is used by all sorts of generic code,
and asm/hw_irq.h by none.  I don't think I'm being unreasonable --
show me some generic irq code that needs architectural support and
I'll add or move what's needed.

As an aside, how exactly do you intend to implement hw_resend_irq
on alpha?  On x86, I see that it fiddles the IOAPIC to do the job;
there is no similar trick on alpha.  Your implementation was a nop,
which just doesn't seem possible.
Perhaps I simply misunderstand what that thing is supposed to be
trying to accomplish.  And for that I might consider the complete
lack of documentation a sort of bug.  ;-)
