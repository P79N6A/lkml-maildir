Yep. I fixed that in the -ac patch but Linus picked up the original patch
instead (which is normally the right thing to do anyway) -I've sent him
the fix which is to put the length back to a ushort. So I wouldnt go
rebuilding and reissuing special clients for 2.2.3pre3,  cos they'll just
break for 2.2.3  and the originals will work again
