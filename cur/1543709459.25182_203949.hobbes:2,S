Subject: 2.4.25: nosmp breaks ICH5 ide irq on S875WP1

I tested 2.4.25 on Intel S875WP1 mainboard. Whren I run a normal SMP
kernel, it works fine. When I give it a "nosmp" boot option (an no other
special options), it fails to boot while detecting IDE devices. The IDE
is Intel ICH5 (ICH5-R?) on a 875P chipset. The hdd's are detected hde
and hdg normally. With "nosmp", it tells
hde: interrupt timeout
(or was it lost interrupt) and this repeats after some time.
So probably the IRQ routing is broken in nosmp. Is this normal somehow?
Have not tried UP kernel.
