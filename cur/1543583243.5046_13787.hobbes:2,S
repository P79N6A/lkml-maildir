Right.  Architectural limit.  There needs to be some room in the
address space for kernel stuff, I/O, etc -- in Linux at least, having
to play with your page tables every single time you enter a system call
or IRQ handler would be considered a Bad Thing.

a) If you have that much memory, maybe you need a 64-bit CPU.
b) fork() and do IPC.  It's the Unix Way.
