Hi-
has anyone else by any chance seen a memory leak during ripping of CDs
or writing CDs. On my system SuSE 9.1 "2.6.5-7.104-default" I can only,
rip or burn one CD. The system runs out of memory and hangs about
half way through the second cd.
I tried just creating the image but not writing and than doesn't seem to
cause the problem. Only when the CD burner is used I see this problem.
The burner is an Emprex DVDRW 1008IM, used on an Athlon XP 2500+
system with 1GB of ram and 1GB of swap. The system seems to lock up
when all the ram is exhausted, the swap is about 90% free.
I haven't debugged the problem much I just wanted to ask around before
I start digging in.
Thanks.
