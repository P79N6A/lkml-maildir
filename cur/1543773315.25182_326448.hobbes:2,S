You have reason about that but the problem is not on RAID Sw, is not even 
setted up atm and i need use it like SATA controller.
When i try to load sata_sil the system give problems describted on the first 
mail and, the worst think, if the modules is builded static on kernel the 
machine hang on boot time when it try to recognize the controller.
The same module work fine whit SIL 3114 and sata disks.
Thanks, Nicolo'
