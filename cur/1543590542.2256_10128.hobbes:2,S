Subject: mmap2 causes SIGBUS on 2.4.4-ac6

After compiling and installing a 2.4.4-ac6 kernel I noticed that some 
programs (notably 'grep') started crashing with 'Bus error's and 
captured some 'strace' output... In all cases the last four lines of 
output from strace are:
mmap2(0x8059000, 32768, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED, 3, 
0) = 0x8059000
mmap2(0x8059000, 32768, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED, 3, 
0xe00008) = 0x8059000
--- SIGBUS (Bus error) ---
+++ killed by SIGBUS +++
For those who would like to try and reproduce it, this command generates 
it every time:
$ grep foo /usr/src/linux/Documentation/*
So there seems to be some mmap related problem with 2.4.4-ac6. I tried 
running the exact same commands on a 2.2.17 and 2.2.19 and they do not 
exhibit this behaviour. I can try some more 2.4.x kernels if the 
information would be valuable?
If there is any other relevant information I can gather, then please let 
me know and I'll be happy to provide it.
I tried searching for "mmap2" and "SIGBUS" on 
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/
 but could not find 
any posts related to this, so I thought it would be ok to post this.
