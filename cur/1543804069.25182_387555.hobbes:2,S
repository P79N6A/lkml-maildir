It could be argued that way.
A quick search of CodingStyle does not
reference the uXX types.
unsigned short is guaranteed to be
at least 16 bits, so no data is lost.
The value is written to the register using
writew(), so no more than 16 bits are used.
Using unsigned short here will always work.
Do you know of a Linux environment where
unsigned short is not 16 bits?
