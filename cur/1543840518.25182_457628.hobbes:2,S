You have a variety of kernel objects you want to worry about and they
have very differing properties.
Some are basically shared resources - page cache, dentries, inodes, etc
and can be balanced pretty well by the kernel (ok the dentries are a bit
of a problem right now). Others are very specific "owned" resources -
like file handles, sockets and vmas.
Tracking actual RAM use by container/user/.. isn't actually that
interesting. It's also inconveniently sub page granularity.
Its a whole seperate question whether you want a separate bean counter
limit for sockets, file handles, vmas etc.
