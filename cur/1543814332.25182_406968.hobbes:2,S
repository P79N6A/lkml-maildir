Subject: 4k at a time only works well for an OS that does less per iteration than Linux does

To sum up for akpm what was said previously in this thread:
Linux needs to take the lesson learned from bios about how going up and
down through various software layers once per 4k is too expensive, and
generalize it to where in general, in all of the layers, we are
operating many pages at a time.  It would be nice for code simplicity if
the same struct, with perhaps some optional attachments to it, was used
the whole trip (rather than pagevecs in once place and bios in another). 
For kernel newbies on lkml let me summarize it as for every trip made
through these layers, a whole lot more than 4k of code gets traversed,
all of it seeming to have some legitimate purpose;-), so only handling
4k per trip is more expensive than you might guess.
Now, for the question that was raised:

I suspect that if the code benefitted more than mosix in its
implementation, and I think it would, then akpm might not be opposed to
the one above provided someone wrote it.  There is a rumor he already
understands this is a problem.  Maybe he can comment on the rumor.;-)

not sure what that means.  You mean surrender?  Not yet.;-)  First we
fix our code so that reiser4 really does what I am arguing it needs to
do, then we will argue it is the right approach.

Oh is that ugly....  no.  Dynamically sized pagevecs (I call them
pagezams) are better.
We will process things in large chunks all the way down to the io layer,
and then wait for Nate or others to fix the io layer someday.
