	Horrible hacks would be what would be required to get a firmware
upgrade to work under Linux with the restrictions in place.  I sure hope
Andre isn't trying to convince drive makers that they can void their
warrentee if something hits those commands the wrong way.

	The comments you left out regarding that you didn't like having to
have things be OS dependant.  The reason they are now is because of end
users.

	Not so, initially, and still currently actually, cdrecord and other
programs used the SCSI generic interface to talk to CD burners.  Obviously
these commands sent to that kind of device initially wouldn't have been
thought valid by the main SCSI layer, or even the SCSI cdrom driver.  The
same may be true in the future for some IDE devices.

	Except those commands are vendor specific and we *don't* know
exactly what all commands need to be blocked.  Instead Andre took the
approach of blocking everything he didn't recognize as a valid command
with 'valid' commands to the device.  Also other devices in the future
may wish to issue other commands to the devices for various reasons and
would find they have to get the kernel updated and upgraded on any
machine they wish to use these devices on.
