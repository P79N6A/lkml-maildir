Nope, there's an int-80-based execve() implemented in
include/asm-i386/unistd.h.  It's called from init/do_mounts_initrd.c
and kernel/kmod.c (at least).

I'd be OK with that - the kernel doesn't (shouldn't) care about the
performance of __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__ stuff.  I doubt if glibc is borrowing
the kernel's macros.

afaik, execve() is the only reason for retaining __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__
support on x86.
