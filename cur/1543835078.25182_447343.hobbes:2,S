That's cool, as long as we still let drivers express minor differences
within the framework (see my last message to Daniel).

They're not totally different, they differ in a very specific way
which allows the difference to be ignored by applications that don't
care.

I have my own list of sysfs gripes (e.g., how do you implement a
"query a register" interface?), but the powers that be decreed we're
supposed to use sysfs for this kind of stuff.

Yes, but not time-sensitive.

Battery polling is already used extensively, and its overhead is
completely negligible. I'm yet to see any deployed userspace code
trying to query battery status more than once per second.
On the other hand, if you send an event whenever the voltage or
current change, you'll flood userspace with junk. So you'll need to
have a "fuzz" like in the input device code; but this may be
client-specific or hardware-specific. And you'll need to identify
devices in a useful way, a problem that's not yet solved even for
input devices... You see where it's going.
