It does seem to work amazingly well, from a performance point of view.

Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the need for the above code... If every qc
was tied to a SCSI command, we could just ask for a later requeue of the
request as is currently done with NCQ commands. Alternatively, we could
add an internal libata qc queue for postponing these commands. That
would take a little effort, as the sync errors reported by
ata_qc_issue() would then be need to signalled async through the
completion callback instead.
Jeff, what do you think?
