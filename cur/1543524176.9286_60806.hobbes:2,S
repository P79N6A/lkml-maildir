<BODY>
<P>Hello guys,</P>
<P>I am facing a problem using MO drives created under 2.0.36 RH 5.2
and 2.2.12 RH 6.1. Same trouble<BR>with 2.2.14</P>
<P>MO medias have been created and used without any trouble since
months with 2.0.36. Now we are<BR>moving to 2.2.12</P>
<P>The last trouble we have is that we are not able to read the MO
medias created on 2.0.36</P>
<P>With 2.0.36 I have declared a partition of 512MB over a MO media
dual-sided of 1.3 Gb</P>
<P>Then mke2fs over and mounted the media. No problem</P>
<P>The external MO drive has been moved after to a 2.2.12 system. Fdisk
shows a blanc disk<BR>without partitions on.</P>
<P>Is someone able to help me ?</P>
<P>Regards</P>
