I had a doubt on this, but I was not getting much feedback from you...
Also, if you reject this, I'd require a comment-only patch for it:
"as soon as I remember why" makes me think back to my yesterday's class, when 
the teacher said "put comments in your code or you'll soon forget what it 
does!" 8-O (yes, 1st year University student :-( ).
