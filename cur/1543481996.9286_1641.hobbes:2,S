   This comment has `SECOND SYSTEM SYNDROME' written all over it in
   _bright red_ marker.
   One of the nice strengths of Unix is that it's basically an ad-hoc
   system, blissfully free of some of the worst excesses of industry and
   academia.   The lack of any good replacement for Unix (and not for
   lack of trying either) may not be proof positive that Unix is the
   best you can get, but it's certainly compelling evidence that `clean,
   modern, well-designed OS'es' aren't.
   Windows NT is a `clean, modern, well-designed OS', for heavens sake,
   and it's already gotten more crufty than Unix is after 25+ plus
   years.
   Shoot, most of the cruft in a modern Unix system is 25 years worth
   of clunky user-space apps that have become the byteware equivalent
   of the holy scripture.   If you want a clean, modern, well-designed
   OS, take an ax to THAT stuff.

   david parsons \bi/ If you want to better Unix, work on things that Unix
                  \/  doesn't do and leave the things that Unix does alone.
