Rusty told me that it is intentional. Add
no_module_init;
at the end of module. He even sent patch which fixes dozen of such
modules (15 I had on my system...) to Linus, but it get somehow lost.
Only question is whether we want to have it this way or no. And if
yes, whether we do not want to move no_module_init from linux/init.h to 
linux/module.h: all of affected modules were already including
module.h to get MODULE_LICENSE() & other, but almost none of them
included init.h.
