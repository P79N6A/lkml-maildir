Hello,
historically I believed Linux very much. When it said my HP Vecra XM 
only has one serial port I was surprised, but believed it. That was 
some years ago. 2.4.18 still says that there is one serial port:
ttyS00 at 0x3f8 (irq=4) as a 16550A
However recently I had to work on the backside of the PC and found 
two(!) serial ports labelled "Serial A" and "Serial B". So shouldn't 
both ports be detected?
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
