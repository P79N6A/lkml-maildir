we don't use a software timer in e1000 irq coalescing/moderation, it's all in
hardware, so we don't have that problem at all. And I certainly have never seen
anything you are referring to with e1000 hardware, and I do not know of any bug
related to this.
are you maybe confused with other hardware?
feel free to demonstrate an example...
