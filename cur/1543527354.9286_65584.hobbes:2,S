To make it a little bit more clear:
It's not because something returns the value 0, that is is represented by
all 0 bits. The value of a comparision is the value 0 (false) or 1 (true),
but you can't assume anything on how it is represented in hardware.
Therefor using a bit-wise operation just makes no sense, and only does for
data where you manipulate bits itself, like in bitfields.
