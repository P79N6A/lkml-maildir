Do you use a large subnet mask?  For example /16 or /8 or
something like that?
If so, you will need to bump up the neighbour table garbage
collection thresholds under /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neight/default/
Specifically gc_thresh1, gc_thresh2, and gc_thresh3
You probably have a huge number of machines on your subnet.
