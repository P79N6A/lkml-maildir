I am just joining your discussion today for the fist time.  I come from
a Windows implementation of async I/O, so please don't hold it against
me.  I can't say that I am following 100% percent, but I think you guys
are talking about what the user API will look like, correct?
Assuming the answer is yes.  Here are my two cents.  The code you have
below seems a bit awkward -- the line while(do_io(fd) != EAGAIN) appears
twice.  I think the reason for that is that you're trying to do too many
things at once, namely, you're trying to handle both the initial
accept/setup of the socket and its steady state servicing.  I don't see
any benefit to that -- it definitely doesn't make for cleaner code.  Why
not do things separately.
1.  Have a setup phase which more or less does:
*  listen()
*  accept()
*  add the new fd/socket to an "event" which all the worker threads are
waiting on.
2.  Have the worker tread/steady state operation be:
*  event_wait() which returns the fd, some descriptor of what exactly
happened (read/write), the number of bytes transferred.
*  based upon the return from event wait the user updates his state, and
posts the next operation (read/write).
Thanks,

Close.  What we would have is a modification of the epoll_addf() 
semantics such that it would have an additional postcondition that if 
the new_fd is in the ready state (has data available) then at least one 
notification has been generated.  In the code above, the three lines 
comprising the if statement labeled "7*" would be removed.
