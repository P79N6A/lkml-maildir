It's not in line with how all other "compatible" properties
are done though.

Ah, I think I understand what you mean now.  Yes, the binding
for this specific rapidio controller should define the _order_
of the interrupts in the "interrupts" property; but it cannot
define the format of the single entries, that is defined by
the interrupt controller node it is connected to already.

It's not religious; true OF believers say leave the node
out if its value would be 1.  It's just that Linux doesn't
handle that properly yet, so you want to protect yourself :-)
