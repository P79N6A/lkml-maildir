It seems that these reasons would not preclude the addition of a flag
that would default to the current behaviour but allow the behaviour that
other setups desire easily?  That seems to be all that folks are really
arguing for.  If/when the user enabled this new flag, then they should
be fully responsible for the change in behaviour, and they can deal with
it as needed.
