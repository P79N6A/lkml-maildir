NAK.  MII address 0 should be scanned _last_, after all other addresses. 
  In some phys, it is a ghost, mirroring another address.
Take a look at some of the original Becker MII scan code from
ftp://ftp.scyld.com/pub/network/
 to see an elegant method for this.
Becker's scan code would utilize a mask to keep the loop nice and 
elegant, eliminating an "if (phy == 32) phy = 0;" test.
