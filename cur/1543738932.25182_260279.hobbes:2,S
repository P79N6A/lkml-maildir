libselinux is_selinux_enabled() checks /proc/filesystems for selinuxfs
first, and SELinux userland checks is_selinux_enabled().  As security
modules cannot presently be stacked if they both use the security
fields, this is sufficient.  There were patches floated on
rhselinux-list circa Oct 2003 to add a "selinux/" prefix to the
/proc/pid/attr values to explicitly identify the security module, ala
the "security.selinux" attribute name for the file extended attribute,
but the consensus at that time was that it was sufficient to test for
the presence of SELinux via /proc/filesystems.

The /proc/pid/attr interface was submitted by us based on Al Viro's
recommendations when the SELinux API was overhauled.  We attempted to
keep it sufficiently general that other security modules could also use
it, but not at the same time, as shared use of LSM security fields
wasn't supported anyway.  We had earlier proposed [gs]etprocattr calls
ala [gs]etxattr calls with distinguished attribute names, but were
directed to use /proc instead.

One value per file seems preferred, but /proc/pid doesn't lend itself to
dynamic extension by modules.  [gs]etprocattr calls ala [gs]etxattr
calls would be simpler if we want to export multiple attribute names,
but that was also suggested earlier and rejected.
Side bar:  Any change here also affects upstream procps, which presently
directly takes the /proc/pid/attr/current value and displays it as a
single field.
