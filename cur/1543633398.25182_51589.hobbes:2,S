It's not improper.  Well it wasn't when it was written, but the gcc
authors decided to change their minds... :(
As stated before, I'll clean up all of the USB drivers later all at

with some good debugging macro cleanup in general...
Martin, any reason you are doing all of this "cleanup" without sending
the patches to the relevant maintainers?
