Thanks for the reply Alan, much appreciated.
No. I can confirm that when booted to Linux 2.6.7, plugged into a VIA
(onboard) VT82C586A/B/VT82C686/A/B/VT823x/A/C PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev
06) it's does NOT exhibit the same problem. It's in DMA ATA33 mode on
that controller.
I have thrashed it with many dds of /dev/zero to the disk whilst
copying files around, and it's fine.
I've got some details at 
http://www.popey.com/promise
 if that helps.
Cheers,
Al.
