I haven't had time to look at your patch in any detail yet.  But I did 
notice the extra stuff in the host-reset path.  It looks like you're 
worrying about nothing -- the easiest thing to do would be to remove the 
host-reset pointer from the host template.  Then the SCSI error handler 
would know that host resets aren't implemented and would never try to 
carry them out.
