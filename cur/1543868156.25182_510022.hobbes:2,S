+ * The update unit.
+ *
+ * This unit implements the volume update operation. In the current
+ * implementation we use an update marker for this. The update marker is
+ * per-volume and is stored in the volume table. The update marker is set
+ * before the update starts, and removed after the update has been finished.
+ * So, if the update was interrupted by an unclean re-boot or due to some other
+ * reasons, the update marker is found and we know that the volume is damaged.
+ *
+ * Note, in general it is possible to implement the update operation as a
+ * transaction with a possibility to roll-back. But this is far more complex.
+ *
+ * This implementation does not support concurrent updates but it is not
+ * difficult to implement this.
