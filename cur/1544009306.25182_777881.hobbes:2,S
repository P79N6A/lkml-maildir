Rafael: there's a bug in your 1/3 patch. 
It looks like "pci_save_state()" is currently unhappy with being called 
with interrupts disabled. Or at least "pci_save_pci[ex]_state()" state 
are. They both do a kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL).
So you should change that GFP_KERNEL into a GFP_ATOMIC. Or do something 
more complicated like pre-allocate them during early suspend, but just 
changing it to GFP_ATOMIC seems to be the trivial fix.
I'm not seeing any other issues with saving/restoring things with irq's 
disabled, but people should be on the lookout for details like this.
