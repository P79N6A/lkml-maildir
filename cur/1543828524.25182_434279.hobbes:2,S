This is very rare, but when it happens it is very irritating.
It has happened on an old Dell Optiplex GX110 (1.0GHZ) and a new 3.4GHZ 
box with a Promise/Maxtor ATA/133 PCI controller.
When more than 1 heavy I/O (cp/mv/etc) process is running and you hit 
control-c on one of the heavy processes, the box locks up and this appears 
in the logs:

Just thought I'd mention it, maybe other people have also experienced this 
as well.
Justin.
