Subject: mmap hang with 2.3.7

If I mmap a large file PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, and then proceed to
read the mmap'ed area with a pointer, my program hangs with kernel
2.3.7. I did not see this with 2.3.6.  The system responds only to 
hot keys like alt-sysrq, which performs only the show-functions or 
reboot.
"Large" meaning definitely larger than available ram; with small
files I don't see this happen, although I don't have the patience 
to narrow that down with experimentation.
The code to open and mmap the file is exactly the same as in 
(actually copied from) scripts/mkdep.c
System is UP, i386, a portion of .config below
