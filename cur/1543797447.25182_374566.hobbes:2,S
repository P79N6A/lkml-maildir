So it's a POWER4 problem.

Eww... If you can't use a serial break, why can't you use an
established control character like ctrl-] (telnet) or [enter]~ (ssh) ?
If you really want to use ctrl-o, could you make a way that pressing
ctrl-o twice sends a single ctrl-o to the process attached to the
console?

If it is a POWER4-only problem, why isn't there a dependency on
CONFIG_POWER4 over here? I don't like to have the ctrl-o sysrq stuff
enabled on my regular PC if it only matters to some rare (in absolute
numbers) system.
