Just wondering: should easy-and-obvious and less-risky patches like this
one be send to the stable-kernel-maintainers in parallel to adding them
to the HG-Tree (or shortly afterwards)? It could safe users lots of
trouble if such improvements make it quickly into production-ready
kernel-releases (and from there they might even find their way into some
distribution kernels quickly). Hardware then would "just work".
Sure, before the stable-maintainer will take such patches they needs to
be added to linus git-tree beforehand as well. And sure, patches like
the one above are not fixing a regression (at least in this case if I
read the thread correctly; the old subject thus is misleading afaics),
but it's similar to a new PCI-ID that gets added to a existing driver --
and that's done now in the stable-series afaics (¹).
The alsa-maintainers seem to be in the best position to do this, but it
seems they rarely do it. I for example was hit by a regression (sound
worked in 2.6.20 and broke afterwards; was fixed in 2.6.23-git by the
following patch in case anybody is wondering:
http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a4eed138add1018846d17e813560b0c7c0ae8e01
), but the alsa-developers did not submit it for stable afaics. Sure, I
could do that myself, but as I said: the alsa-maintainers really have
the best overview over the alsa-patches and should know which patches
are safe to apply for older kernels.
