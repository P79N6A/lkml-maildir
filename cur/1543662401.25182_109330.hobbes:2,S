I suspect the real solution would be to add an "echo" queue to the tty
layer.  However, that's probably not a trivial change.
Although the problems with low latency tty's are now fixed in the patch
below (opost can be called from IRQ context), there is one concern
remaining that someone (not me) needs to consider.  What are the
locking implications of schedling here.
Bear in mind that the tty layer relies on the BKL, which is dropped when
we explicitly reschedule.
I'd suggest that the existing "dropping echo characters" behaviour is
probably better than the possible instability that could result here,
especially for 2.4.
I'll leave the final decision up to someone else, since I'm not actively
involved with tty stuff in 2.4.  Does someone else want to comment?
