Is the Intel 82562ET Supported by the EtherExpress driver in the kernel,
or is it neccessary to use the e100 driver provided by intel? I'm trying
to talk a client through getting his network card working and don't have
physical access to the box. 
It's an onboard NIC on the D815EEA desktop board made by Intel.
Thanks for any help.
