Why urandom ? The safest way to destroy all information on disk should
be to reverse _all_ magnetic particles (flip and flip back)

A better scheme would be 10101010 - 01010101 - 11111111 - 00000000
BUT:
if I write a bit pattern to the disk - how is it stored ?
Remember, CD data are re-encoded to avoid long 1 or 0 patterns.
I'd guess, with fuzzy bit stuffing nowadays harddisk use similar
techniques... so perhaps a "all ones / all zeroes" pattern is
re-encoded to something that is near ...01010101010...
