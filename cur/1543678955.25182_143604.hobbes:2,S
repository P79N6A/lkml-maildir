Point taken,  Apologies to the list.
I was combining citations and didn't notice the private-jab nature of the
original.  I guess I got "testy". 8-)
I think all the fertile ground has been salted to death anyway, so barring
any meaningful content or question sent my way Take my two-back comment as
my out-comment on the topic.  8-)
Rob.
