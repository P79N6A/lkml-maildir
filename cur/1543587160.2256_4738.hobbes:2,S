You might check out this:

I did some work on leveling out the recalculation overhead.  I think, as
the code shows, that it can be done without dropping the run queue lock.
I wonder if the wave nature of the recalculation cycle is a problem.  By
this I mean after a recalculation tasks run for relatively long times
(50 ms today) but as the recalculation time approaches, the time reduces
to 10 ms.  Gets one to thinking about a way to come up with a more
uniform, over time, mix.
