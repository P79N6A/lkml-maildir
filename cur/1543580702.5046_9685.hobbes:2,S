Excluding the root fs (which probably isn't involved in these sorts of
things anyways), you can always turn off the "RECOVERY" flag on the
filesystem and mount ext3 as ext2, which will not do any recovery.

Very true.  Any changes made by the writer will not be noticed by the
reader if it has already cached those pages.  Best to use a cluster
filesystem in all of these cases.
