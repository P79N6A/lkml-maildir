That may fix the compile warning, but it doesn't make the driver work with 
a 64-bit dma_addr_t. It just shoves the warning under the carpet.
I sent Jeff Garzik a newer version of the driver which adds proper support
for 64-bit dma_addr_t, it's probably sitting in his to-merge queue. This 
change should be backed out, however.
Thanks,
Ion
