The problem is that the module was (theoretically) allowed to manage
capability bits all on its own.  I think it's a bit of a braindamaged
idea though, and the bits should just stay in the ->cap_* fields.

I think Stephen mentioned this already, but you lose an error now,
where you continue in cap_set_all().
