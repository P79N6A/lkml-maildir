Hello!
  I just found something that is looks strange for me. Correct me if I am wrong.
  Problematic kernel version is 2.2.5
  I have static route:
195.5.61.204	195.5.61.19	255.255.255.255	UGH	0	0	0 eth3
  After some time ppp connection is established with remote IP 
  being 195.5.61.204, and this line is added to routing list:
195.5.61.204	0.0.0.0		255.255.255.255 U	0	0	0 ppp0
  If I do 'traceroute 195.5.61.204', I still see that packets going to
  195.5.61.19, however under 2.0.3X all is fine and packets going directly
  to ppp channel. Am I missing something?
  (and yes, I have net-tools 1.50)
Bye,
    Oleg
