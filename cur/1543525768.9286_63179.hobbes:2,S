If a hardware device asserts its interrupt line long enough for the
interrupt controller to see it, it is latched. That is how the interrupt
controller 'remembers' that an interrupt occurred. It doesn't care
if the interrupt line is deasserted before the CPU is notified. In fact,
because of the priority of higher-priority pending interrupts the
CPU probably won't know about it right away. That's why any pending
hardware interrupts are latched.
I do know about this chipset.
