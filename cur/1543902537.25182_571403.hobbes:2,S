I think you can do:
git checkout origin
git pull
git checkout master
git rebase origin
In general, people seem to keep "from-linus" branches which they never 
modify. I guess they only ever pull linus into there, and then rebase 
their customised branch-of-choice (master, in your case) on top of that 
one in order to keep up-to-date.
