Any janitor want to tackle this request-for-patch?  :)
There exists two problems:
a) default io-apic boot messages are quite verbose
b) io-apic bugs and anomalies are common enough that it would be nice to 
enable additional messages when the user requests them
My preferred solution is
apic=verbose -- enable verbose boot messages (seen in current kernels)
apic=debug -- enable all messages, including ones normally hidden by 
APIC_DEBUG
And the default, without any apic=xxx, would be not to show either set 
of messages.
This solution hides the messages for those who would rather not see 
them, but ensures they are available via a boot parameter when kernel 
developers wish to request additional debug info from a user.
