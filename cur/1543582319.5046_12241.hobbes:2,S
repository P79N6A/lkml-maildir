Hello!
> So the actual timeout would be 2 * SO_SNDTIMEO.
It will timeout if write of some page blocks for SO_SNDTIMEO.
If transmission of any page never takes more than SO_SNDTIMEO it never
times out.
You can think about sendfile() as subroutine doing:
	for (;;) {
		read(4K from fdin);
		write(4K to fdout);
	}
All the options apply to each read()/write() separetely, so that... alas.
