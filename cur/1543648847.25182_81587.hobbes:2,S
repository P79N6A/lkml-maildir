Hello all,
I'm not sure, but I think that there are compile problems since the
2.4.20pre-kernels with pcmcia-cs package 3.2.1. I get the following
warnings:

                  from wvlan_hcfio.c:121:
../include/linux/kernel.h:10: warning: `EXPORT_SYMTAB' redefined
Is this a problem of the kernel haeders or should the pcmcia-package be
fixed?
