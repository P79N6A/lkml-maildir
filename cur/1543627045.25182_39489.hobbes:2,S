Patched it into 2.4.19-pre5-ac2 (minus the earlier radeon patches that I
chainsawed out several days ago :-).  Have been running for a few hours
now using console and X with a lot of switching back and forth.  Also
spent some time using xawtv and some fb goodies.  Played some tuxracer
just to be sure GL was okay.  All seems quite well with no problems to
report.
Hardware/Software:
ATI Radeon 7500/64MB
Athlon 1700+ VIA K266A
Redhat more/less 7.2.
XFree 4.2 (RH 4.2.0-6.52)
Thanks,
