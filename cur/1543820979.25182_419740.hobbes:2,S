Using HZ here feels just wrong to me. MAX_IPD_TIME has nothing to do with the
timer frequency. In this case it's used to tell if there were 30 machine
checks within the last 5 minutes (in a usec granularity). It's just by
accident that this could be expressed using HZ.
(5 * 60 * USEC_PER_SEC) would probably look better...
