We're facing 8.0 now, the successor of 7.3...

Using SuSE since ages (4.3), I didn't came across this one...
Have a look in /usr/include/linux. They put some "standard" linux include
there :(. I've allways linked it to: 
# l -d /usr/include/linux
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           26 10. Mär 15:34 /usr/include/linux 
-> ../src/linux/include/linux
strace is a pretty cool tool for this problem domain, btw ;)
Cheers,
