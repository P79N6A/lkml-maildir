There are some obvious problems with this.  First, a malloc'ed
buffer might not be in memory.  It might not be created yet if you
haven't touched it, and it might be on swap if you have.  
The recommended way is to allocate in the kernel, (probably by
the driver that want to do DMA), and mmap this buffer into
userspace.
