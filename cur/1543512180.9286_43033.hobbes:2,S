I propose to junk nothing, as no one does. I do, however,
see a bunch of problems stated thusly:
	- inability to summarize devices (and their interfaces)
	  recognized by the kernel from userland unless extensive
	  probing is done by a lock grabbing program.
	- Inflexible major/minor restrictions that are
	  unsustainable unless increasing dev_t which has
	  implications in and outside the kernel
	- Horendous userland hacks in order to be able to
	  use hot plug devices. PCMCIA, USB
	- Lack of an extremely dynamic runtime device
	  scheme, needed to support USB and PCMCIA to
	  a lesser extent
	- Devices named serially such that if one from in
	  the middle is removed, all subsequent devices must
	  be addressed differently. As stated before, UUID
	  solutions only work on FSes with UUIDs, or things
	  that even USE an FS!!!
	- Others I can't even think of right now.
And ONE, count 'em, ONE clean solution, or at least the cleanest one
to date, and it based on solid foundation, whatever anyone has to
say about it's implementation, which, is indeed the least intrusive
I can think of!

You are so completely wrong here, it's as if you've never heard of
SYSV style device naming conventions. It's defacto standard. Suffice
it to say that location based naming schemes are the only way to go.
UUID is arbitrary, and, is therefore a HACK.

I don't get what you're saying here.

Wrong, as explained above. What about raw (well, at least
non-fs) volumes??? Please address even ONE of my points.
