BTW. I looked a linux-pci and only saw 2 complaints about the e1000 and
sym2 driver patches to implement error recovery. I suppose you could
just drop those 2 and keep the infrastructure in. However, I'm a bit
annoyed because Linas did post those patches (and several times I think)
to the relevant lists, and possibly the maintainers (not sure about
that) and no comment was ever made...
I find it fairly annoying (and that's not the first time that happens)
that a major piece of work gets posted publically several times, nobody
bothers to comment, and by the time it gets send for merging upstream,
suddenly, people wakeup from all over the place NAK'ing it for all sort
of reasons, mostly claiming it wasn't properly reviewed by the
appropriate maintainers...
Ben.
