This is starting to be a FAQ so...
The way Linus wants to work with BK is to have a BK tree from which he
can pull when he is ready to accept those changes.  You can set up a
tree at your site if they haven't firewalled everything or you can set
one up on bkbits.net.
The main reason bkbits.net exists is because lots of commercial companies
don't want to have any open ports so there isn't an easy way to make
your tree available.  Since BK works over http there is an easy way for
you to get in/out from the inside but outsiders are stuck.
Go www.bitkeeper.com and click on Hosted Projects, it will tell you how
to set one up.  Let me know if you have problems/questions.
