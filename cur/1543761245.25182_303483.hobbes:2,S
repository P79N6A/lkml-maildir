A quick (hopefully) question.
When mousedev is compiled as a module, loading psmouse or usbhid
modules does not enable the mouse, one have to load mousedev too.
The same is true for keybdev and actual keyboard drivers.
Why not add this dependancy explicitly in psmouse et al modules,
something like (pseudocode):
#if CONFIG_MOUSEDEV==m
  request_module(mousedev);
#endif
, or, to "use" some symbol in psmouse.ko which is defined in mousedev?
Thanks.
