I think I'm beginning to understand what you mean, but it still seems way too 
complicated for my taste. Devices with multiple profiles seems like a static 
property more than a dynamic one, so simply splitting up these weirdo devices 
into multiple logical devices at registration time seems like a better idea. 
Each logical device would then have a separate set of axes, keys and, with my 
patch, usages.
