Sorry, i should look at the rest of the code. Seeing only that, is seems like
that variables have to hold an initial value of zero, and the patch relies
on the ANSI behaviour of the compiler that auto-initializes them to 0.
I have seen many compilers break ANSI rules in optimized mode. Typical
runs-fine-in-debug-mode-but-breaks-on-production-release.
One other point for info would be gcc specs.
