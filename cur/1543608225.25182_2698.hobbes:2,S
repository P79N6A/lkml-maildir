Uhm, no, it really doesn't.  See how it pairs with other instructions and 
what the cost is when it doesn't have to be as bad:
this:
	unsigned long a, b;
	if (++a == 0) b++;
gives:
        movl    a, %eax
        movl    %esp, %ebp
        incl    %eax
        testl   %eax, %eax
        movl    %eax, a
        je      .L3
.L2:
        popl    %ebp
        ret
        .p2align 4,,7
.L3:
        incl    b
        jmp     .L2
which is really gross considering that:
	unsigned long long c;
	c++;
gives:
        addl    $1, c
        adcl    $0, c+4
which is quite excellent.
