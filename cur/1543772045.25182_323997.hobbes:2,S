This is the worst result from the second box:
Freeing memory...  done (54641 pages freed)
Freeing memory...  done (0 pages freed)
Freeing memory...  done (5120 pages freed)
Freeing memory...  done (1952 pages freed)
Freeing memory...  done (2304 pages freed)
Still, there are 5x more pages freed in the first pass (80% of RAM was
empty anyway before suspend), and usually it is 10-20x more or so.
AFAICT, on x86-64 shrink_all_memory(10000) is good enough.
Greets,
Rafael
