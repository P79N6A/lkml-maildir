naah.  preempt() means preempt.  But the implementation
is in fact maybe_preempt(), or preempt_if_needed().
I use (verbosely) (simplified):
#define conditional_schedule_needed()	unlikely(current->need_resched)
#define unconditional_schedule()	do {
						__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING)
						schedule();
					} while(0);
#define conditional_schedule()		if (conditional_schedule_needed())
						unconditional_schedule();
...
foo()
{
	...
	conditional_schedule();
	...
}
bar()
{
	...
	if (conditional_schedule_needed()) {
		spin_unlock(&piggy_lock);
		unconditional_schedule();
		spin_lock(&piggy_lock);
		goto clean_up_mess;
	}
	...
}
