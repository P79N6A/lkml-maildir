Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.2, Partition support for SCSI CDROM...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings.
This patch enables support for CDROMs that have partitions on
them, like say SGI and SUN media. It was sent to me by Christoph
Hellwig and then I cleaned it up a bit. I am posting it more
for flamebait^Wcomments to see if people are comfortable with it.
Thanks.

+	  The number of partitions supported per SCSI CDROM device. If

+	  node mappings:
+
+	     sr0 - first CDROM, whole disk
+	     sr1 - first CDROM, first partition

+	     sr8 - second CDROM, whole disk
+	     sr9 - second CDROM, first partition
+
+	     [...]
+
+	  You made need to create additional device nodes depending on
+	  the number of partitions and SCSI CDROM devices you have in
+	  your system.
+	  
+	  If SCSI CDROM support is compiled as a module, you can specify
+	  how many partitions you want when you insert the module which
+	  will override this default value.
