I had been testing 2.5.2-pre11 and earlier, but hadn't looked at
reading from my cdrom for a while.  Yesterday I created examined several
large cdrom sets that had been readable earlier and they read partially
but get read errors.  These same cdroms can be read reliable on
2.4.18-pre3 using the same hardware, and are readable on other
PC's runing older kernels.
Has anyone else seen cdrom read errors with 2.5.2-pre* kernels?
Using 2.5.2-pre11
# mount /cdrom && md5sum /cdrom/*
md5sum: /cdrom/dcd-c.tar.gz: I/O error
md5sum: /cdrom/dcd-d.tar.gz: I/O error
An example of some of the messages were

using 2.4.18-pre3 I get no errors
