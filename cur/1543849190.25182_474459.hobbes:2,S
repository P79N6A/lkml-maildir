Cpusets is a hierarchical space.  What happens in a subtree
of the /dev/cpuset hierarchy should not be affecting others.
Partitioning sched domains is a flat space - dividing the
CPUs of a system into disjoint partitions.
Using details deep in the cpuset hierarchy to define global
partitions leads to chaos in the minds of those coming at
this from the cpuset side.
The lack of any means on a production system to view the
resulting partition leads to ignorance of how deep is the
chaos, a dangerous state of affairs.
