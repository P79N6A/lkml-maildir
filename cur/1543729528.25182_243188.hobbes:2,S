Hi.
It is interesting.
We(*) also make crash dump acording to similer concept.
    (*) NTT Data Corporation & VA Linux Systems Japan K.K.
Our main idea is the following.
- prepare a kernel which does only dump real memory to block
  device. ("dump mini kernel")
- pre-allocate the memory (4MB is enough) used by the dump mini
  kernel and pre-load the dump mini kernel.
- when crash occur exec the dump mini kernel.
- the dump mini kernel stands in and only uses pre-allocated
  area.
We made mkexec(mini kernel exec) based on kexec code but 
simplify a lot. Mkexec can co-exist kexec and can be kernel
module. We made also "dump mini kernel". 
(now i386 only)
We will open our code shortly. (maybe I think)
I think there are many items to be able to cooperate.
Thank you.
