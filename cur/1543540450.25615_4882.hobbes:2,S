When using reiserfs, the risk to crash the filesystem with this approach compared to the
general risk is zero, because the journaling is always done entirely, or never. The time
between a transaction completes is irrelevant. (Of course your file system metadata
state might be reset to the state of hours ago.) AFAIK, all journaling data is sync()
like hurried to disk without leaving kflushd to choose to do that sometimes later. So
you should get you filesystem in a nearly always consistent and current state, but all
writes to files after that which do not trigger a sync() will be lost. (So you can loose
data, but not metadata).
