I have a distantly similar configuration: 3ware 8506-4LP controller, 4
250GB Western Digital SATA drives, RAID5 (with one hot spare, so the
array is only 500GB), running dual 2.8GHz Xeon CPUs on a Supermicro
X5DPEG2 motherboard with 4GB of RAM.  The OS is Fedora Core 2 fully
updated; kernel is 2.6.6-1.435.2.3smp (which is basically 2.6.7rc3
plus security fixes).
IO is just glacial.  Things go well for a time but then everything
slows to a crawl.  The machine has very little load: a mostly inactive
NFS export, mysql running a few queries per second on a very small
database, that kind of thing.  Certainly the entire working set fits
easily into available RAM.
Yet on occasion it can take upwards of a minute just to ssh in.  This
machine took over half of the load from a poor 2GHz Athlon machine
with 1GB of RAM running Red Hat 7.2 and it feels far slower.
It took three seconds to run this:

I actually have several of these machines and can spare one for
testing.  If anyone has any suggestions, I'm happy to try them out.

I have used 3ware cards extensively for many years now and have never
known them to be slow like this.  This configuration should easily be
able to saturate the drives (or the bus, whichever comes first).
