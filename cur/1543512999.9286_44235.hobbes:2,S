Subject: PATCH:  SysRq corrections on Intel Laptops [2.2.12]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Wheee, first patch for 2.2.12! :)
Anyway, this patch for kernel 2.2.12 corrects a problem on some laptops
which require a Fn key along with Alt to reach the SysRq key, which also
activates the overlay keypad and changes all the keys around.
This patch is baised off of a Compaq LTE Lite 4/25's laptop keyboard
layout, so it might be off for slightly different configurations.  The
keymap is:
+--+--+--+--+
|7 |8 |9 |0 |   <- Origonal key
| 7| 8|	9| *|  	<- Fn+key mapping.  Patch corrects this.
++-++-++-++-++ 
 |U |I |O |P | 
 | 4| 5| 6| -| 
 ++-++-++-++-++
  |J |K |L |; |
  | 1| 2| 3| +|
+-++-++-++-++-++
|N |M |, |. |/ |
|  | 0|  |  |  |
+--+--+--+--+--+
It's complicates things a bit.  I bet if we just pass through the keycode
through and totally ignore the keypad (doing the remapping back there in
drives/char/sysrq.c), it would make for a simpler solution.
