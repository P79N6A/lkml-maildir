Huh? There are several places which need larger vmalloc area, so even if
you'd preallocated some vmalloc pgdirs, you could easily run out of them and
would need exactly the same set_pgdir() to allocate further pgdirs.
If you preallocate 8 pgdirs, then the current scheme will do set_pgdir 8
times... What's the problem? It is usually not speed critical.
Not to say that with nice MMU you don't have to suffer from such complexity
at all.
