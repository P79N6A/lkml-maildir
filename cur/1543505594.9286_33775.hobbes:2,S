Here, NFS stops after a while with 0.89H 75% of my cards are affected,
like yours.

Maybe the de4x5 driver is also an option.

As said, a test with 0.89H gave same results here: On 7 from 9
Systems, a network install of a default Linux system was not possible.
NFS halted here. 0.90 worked well on all these systems.
In case you don´t have 0.90, it is in 2.0.37 and I´should have diff for
2.2.11 at 
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/bk/kernel/for-2.2.11/tulip-0.90.diff
within 24 hours.
Also, there is a 0.91g tulip.c, which is quite good hidden in the second
part of a link on the tulip development page. 
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/test/tulip.c
There are also two secret 0.90 versions:
http://cesdis1.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/test/tulip.c-90q
http://cesdis1.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/test/tulip.c-90z
Please tell me your results.
