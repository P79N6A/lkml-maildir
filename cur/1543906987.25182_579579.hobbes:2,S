Greetings
I'm experiencing double disk spin down issue on my HP nx6310 laptop
during shut down and suspend to disk. The drive is power down on "Will
now halt message" then turned back on and off again with the laptop
itself. I'm using the newest bios available F.0D, 2.6.23-rc1-mm kernel
along with Debian Unstable plus fixes from Sidux repository so I have
the updated shut down script. I have also verified on two other
systems [AMD/Nforce based] that the spin down issue has been resolved
by the Sidux update and I'm certain that this is a hp bios bug or a
piix kernel module problem.
