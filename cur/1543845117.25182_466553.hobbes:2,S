Pretty good actually.

That looks like transmission failure and to me it doesn't seem to be a 
driver problem and please don't add your drive to sata_sil blacklist. 
The blacklist is for very specific cases and won't fix your problem 
other than sometimes hiding the real problem by slowing things down a lot.
When does such error occur?  Is it reproducible?  How often does it occur?

Can you give a shot at 2.6.18?  It contains improved EH which should be 
able to recover from the condition you described.
