Subject: try acpi -V & acpi -V & acpi -V (was Linux v2.6.13-rc3)

Hmmm... switched today on my Vaio laptop to 2.6.13-rc3. Known 
(see 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4124
) is still here. 
A fact that could help, or not, chasing it down: when there are problems 
with acpi events, it happens the following too: 
# acpi -V & acpi -V & acpi -V 
[2] 23884
[3] 23885
     Battery 1: charged, 0%
     Thermal 1: ok, 73.0 degrees C
  AC Adapter 1: on-line
[2]  - 23884 done       acpi -V
rukbat:~/tmp%
     Battery 1: charged, 0%
     Thermal 1: ok, 73.0 degrees C
  AC Adapter 1: on-line
[3]  + 23885 done       acpi -V
Battery 1: charging, 93%, 06:22:58 until charged
     Thermal 1: ok, 73.0 degrees C
  AC Adapter 1: on-line     
It happens just sometime, bust repeating acpi -V & acpi -V in fast succession 
it gives a 0% reading in few tries. Kernel is vanilla, no patch applied. 
HTH,
