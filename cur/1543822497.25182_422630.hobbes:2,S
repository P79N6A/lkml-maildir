Actually I do, altough I admit my reply was for more the general case with
pointers. And that I was using TAGS to jump around the function and didn't
notice that copy_semid_from_user was defined just above the function :-/
OK, it's getting late for me.

Yes, but the attribute could still remove the warning without adding more
instructions.  And the fact that the attribute is there, we can use it to
know that it was looked at and remind us that it's used.
OK, we could just have an attribute on the declaration of the variable
that keeps that warning turned off.  It also lets us know that someone
looked at that variable to make sure it is ok. And we can still undefine
the attribute definition with a make parameter if we want to recheck all
those warnings.

OK in theory, with this example it does have enough info.  But how much
info do you want gcc to hold while it's compiling?
To know that it's ok you need to know the following:
(what you've mentioned)
 setbuf is initialized
     cmd == IPC_SET
      and
     if copy_sem_from_user returns zero.
 setbuf isn't used unless cmd == IPC_SET
Now gcc will also need to know (which is there, but extra info for
compiling):
  setbuf->uid is updated in copy_sem_from_user and it returns zero.
  setbuf->out is updated in copy_sem_from_user and it returns zero.
  setbuf->mode is updated in copy_sem_from_user and it returns zero.
So it isn't enough to just know sembuf was updated, but you also need to
know what parts of the structure is initialized and used.  This example is
trivial, but what happens when you have structures with 100 elements, and
some with pointers to other elements.  Should gcc keep track of all that
too?
