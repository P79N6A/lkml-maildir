That's something that amazes me - why aren't there anu SATA CD/DVD 
drives? Seems to me that CD/DVD could have the same benifits of using a 
thin cable and eventually getting away from the IDE interface. Or - 
since there are usually plenty of USB 2 ports, why not have a CD/DVD 
that internally connect to USB?
Another thing I've wondered about was why not build a 3 1/2 inch CD/DVD 
drive? There are plenty of the small disks available. Seems like a 
logical product to develop.
