I think I've found a bug in swapfs:
fstab:
swapfs          /dev/shm        swapfs  defaults 0 0
swapfs         /tmp    swapfs  defaults 0 0
When I hit <enter> on a tar.gz file in Midnight Commander nothing happens. If 
I do a umonut /tmp and hit <enter> again it works as It should (I see the 
archived files).
Nearly the same Problem with the Acrobat Reader pluin for Netscape. It shows 
only a blank page when /tmp is swapfs.
I've noticed that it's possible to mount /tmp more than once. mount shows then
[snip]
swapfs on /dev/shm type swapfs (rw)
swapfs on /tmp type swapfs (rw)
swapfs on /tmp type swapfs (rw)
swapfs on /tmp type swapfs (rw)
swapfs on /tmp type swapfs (rw)
The permissions for /tmp are rwxrwxrwt, and even -omode=777,exec didn't help.
Any Ideas?
