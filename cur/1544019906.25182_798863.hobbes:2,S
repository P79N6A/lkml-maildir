Okay a bit tired and headache coming on but I'll try, maybe jbarnes
can help out,
We need to provide mappings to userspace that are backed by memory
that can move around behind the mappings.
So userspace wants a mapping for a GEM object via the AGP/GTT aperture
instead of directly to the backing pages.
Now as the GEM object is backed by shmem we can't use the shmem file
descriptor we have to tie the mapping to without
hacking up the shmem mmap functionality which seemed like a bad plan.
So GEM uses the device inode to setup the mappings on. We just use a
simple linear allocator to split up the device inodes address space
and assign chunks to handles for different objects. The userspace app
then uses the handle via mmap to get access to the VMAs. Now when GEM
wants to move that object out of the GTT or to another area of the GTT
we need some way to invalidate it, so we use unmap_mapping_range
which destroys all the mappings for the object in all the VMA for all
the processes mapping it currently
GEM's read_mapping_page is distinct from this and is to do with the
shmem interfaceing.
Not sure if this explains it or just make it worse.
Dave.
