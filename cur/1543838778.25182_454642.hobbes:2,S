I know, and this is not what I'm targetting. People use 2.4 on their file
server or firewall for instance, on an old distro, while they use 2.6 on
their notebook with newer gcc. They build from their fresh new system
(because most often you don't install build tools on a server) and this
is at least why some of them have already been asking for this. To be honnest,
I don't really need gcc 4 myself right now, but I'm more responding to some
users demand that I find somewhat legitimate.

Agreed, that's also why I've left it in another tree right now, so that
interested people can test it and other ones have the time to pronounce
themselves against it if needed. Anyway, as I said, most of the fixes were
for real coding bugs, and do not affect either the output code nor external
patches. I don't want to experiment with new killer features at all, if I
accepted to work on 2.4, this is because I'm rather conservative ;-)
Cheers,
Willy
