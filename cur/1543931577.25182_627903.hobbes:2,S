Hi,
I am looking at how exactly does the printf in user programs succeeds in
displaying characters to the serial console.
printf uses /dev/console to write the data. Once written to
/dev/console, what happens to the string written?
Is there any way, I can get access to those prints/string inside the
kernel?
Thanks
Siva
