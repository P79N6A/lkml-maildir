Pekka, if none of the previous methods helps in better debugging this, 
then one of the easiest ways to catch scheduler latency bugs (e.g.  
related to sync wakeups, etc.) would be to try the -RT tree.
It has a built-in kernel/scheduler tracer that gets started upon wakeup 
and is stopped when the task finally runs. If we lose a preemption 
somewhere then this kernel should catch it. The -RT tree is development 
code, but should work fine on most systems. Here's a QuickStart:
1)
 download the latest patch from 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
2)
 patch your 2.6.12-rc5 tree with it
3)
 copy your usual .config into this tree and do 'make oldconfig' - just 
 accept the default options it offers, except for the following two 
 cases: when it says "Preemption Mode", pick #1:
  1. No Forced Preemption (Server) (PREEMPT_NONE) (NEW)
 when it asks:
 Interrupts-off critical section latency timing (CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING) 
 pick 'y'.
 when it asks:
  Latency tracing (LATENCY_TRACE) [N/y/?] (NEW) y
 pick 'y' too.
4) compile & install your kernel as ususal and reboot into it.
now you'll be running a kernel with tracing built-in. The kernel comes 
with the 'wakeup-timing' feature enabled by default, which can be
started via:
   echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
after this point you should get the maximum scheduling latencies 
reported to the syslog:
 [root@saturn ~]# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
 [root@saturn ~]# dmesg | tail
 (          IRQ 17-776  |#0): new 1 us maximum-latency wakeup.

 (          IRQ 17-776  |#0): new 38 us maximum-latency wakeup.
 (          IRQ 17-776  |#0): new 40 us maximum-latency wakeup.
 (          IRQ 17-776  |#0): new 70 us maximum-latency wakeup.
 [root@saturn ~]#
the kernel function trace of the largest latency will be under 
/proc/latency_trace:
 [root@saturn ~]# cat /proc/latency_trace

(if you have the APIC code and the NMI watchdog enabled then you'll also 
get a trace of userspace code looping in irqs-off sections.)
at this point try to reproduce the X hang. Do you get any large 
(3000-5000 usecs) latency reported? (assuming you can reproduce the hang 
under the -RT kernel)
(if you dont get any large latency reported by the tracer but the hangs 
still happen then there's still a way to get this debugged, by running 
the tracer in a free-running manually-triggered mode - i'll tell more 
about this if it becomes necessary.)
