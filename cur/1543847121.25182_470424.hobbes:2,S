Yeah, but usbcore changes hcd->state without holding the spinlock.

(Or suspended?)
Well, I'm not familiar with the code so I accept your statement.
However, consider that even though ohci-hcd may not have timers, usbcore
does have the root-hub status timer, and it calls into ohci-hcd whenever
that timer expires.  Even though root-hub interrupts are now used, there
still are occasions when the driver asks for polling.  More than there
used to be, thanks to my auto-stop changes.
