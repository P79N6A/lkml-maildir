I disagree. If you have any proof, please show it.
Let me repeat:
We have seen *zero* drives that do not understand 256 sector commands.
We have seen *one* drive (a six years old Maxtor 7850AV) that could not
sustain heavy load with max # secs set to 256, while it behaved better
with max set to 255.
But we have seen lots of old old drives that show all kinds of errors.

Paul remarked: "So the 255 (or even the old 128) fixes things vs. 256,
but I'd feel better being 100% sure why. Is 255 a "fix" or a perturbation
that happens to paper over something else?"
I think there is no good reason to limit us to 255 sectors.
(And no reason for blacklists either - there is just no good evidence
that something is systematically wrong with 256 sectors for any brand or
model. Things would change if a second Maxtor 7850AV owner could confirm.)
