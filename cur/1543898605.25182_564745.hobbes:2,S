But the ability to launder pages is needed. During hibernation we need
to shrink memory. I don't see how this would be fundamentally different
from calling sync.

I don't and it might point to a fundamental problem.
But I cannot help but notice that syscalls may happen while the system
is partially frozen. It must be dealt with.

Where exactly would that code notice the errors?
