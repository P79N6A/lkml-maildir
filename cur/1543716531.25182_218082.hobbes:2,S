Let's see...  Leaving aside obvious userland code (arch/*/boot/*, scripts/*,
drivers/char/ip2/ helpers) and arch/um/* instances that are, AFAICS, in
userland code too and refer to libc open(2), we have
	a) drivers/media/dvb/frontends pile (AFAICS, loading firmware)
	b) systemcfg_init() in asm-ppc64/systemcfg.h (WTF is that about?)
	c) sound/isa/wavefront/wavefront_synth.c (loading firmware)
	d) sound/oss/wavfront.c (loading firmware)
	e) odd calls of sys_close() in binfmt_elf.c, eventpoll.c and socket.c
	f) potentially racy flush_unauthorized_files() in selinux code - uses
sys_close() in a strange way.
That's it.  And I suspect that we ought to switch the firmware loaders to
use of existing helper.
