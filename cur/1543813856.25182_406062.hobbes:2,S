I'm still a bit surprised, since in the rest of the kernel we are even 
going from -O2 to -Os for getting better performance.
Robert said he wanted to post some numbers showing that -O3 is

UTS_VERSION is already available and printed at the top of dmesg.
I don't see the point in printing it a second time.
