Hi Andi,
Thanks for the review.  I implemented many of your suggestions and for
the rest, here mention why not, in case you want to respond further.
Regards,

v4 now has a comment to the Documentation section noting
this.

Occasional ECC _corrections_ are normal (due to stray alpha particles)
but ECC _failures_ are not.  Document corrected.

Although irq_exit() releases the preemption block, it doesn't seem to
release the APIC interrupt block, at least for i386.  And as an interrupt
block also blocks preemption and process migration, it seems that it would
be safe to do the increments after the irq_exit().  But I've moved them
all inside in v4, just in case I am wrong, or this changes in the future
(eg, PREEMPT_RT).

v3 addresses this.  The normally empty 'description' column at the end of
each line now holds a description of each vector.  The three-character
line-prefix names are there only to make the new lines match the syntax
and format of the other lines in /proc/interrupts.

Will do.
Thanks,
Joe
PS: also fixed up the whitespace.
