    I had an idea for DRM, what about a kernel that forces everything downloaded to have a 
valid signature, and doesn't let the file/program be accessed otherwise?
    We could discuss ideas now, move on to code examples next, and then draw up a whitepaper,
    All those who are interested mail me.
