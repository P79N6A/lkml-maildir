I'm by no means a kernel programmer, but after pondering the issues of
memory management, shared libraries, etc I came upon an idea.
Has anybody considered making shared text segments? (text meaning the
executable code + constant data, right?)
This would allow e.g. one to run Emacs once, and then have 9 other people
run Emacs without having to load the Emacs code core in again.  Same
concept as shared libraries.
Or Netscape, since we all know how big of a monster Netscape is.
This would allow for maximum memory efficiency on, for example, machines
with low amounts of RAM.  I remember when I used to use a 486/33MHz with
8MB RAM, I used to dread at the size of Lynx, but lynx was my favorite
program to run.  Having something like this would be excellent.
Thanks to all who consider this idea
-Eric
