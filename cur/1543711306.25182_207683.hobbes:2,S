Have a bit of caution there, cdrecord sets itself realtime priority, 
locks pages in memory, and ensures that the process is likely to work 
even under load. I don't think addressing just a part of the problem 
will result in reliability under load. You would have to look at 
capabilities to allow these things to be done, under load they may not 
keep up depending on what's going on. Good to get a start, don't assume 
all the issues are addressed.
