   It better be, because -X only sets the transfer mode on the device, not
on the adapter. On PCs the BIOS should set up the adapter and devices
correctly. At least one ABit motherboard BIOS (Award, IIRC) version has
failed to do so, setting the devices to UDMA 4 when the motherboard adapter
only supported UDMA 2, so try a BIOS update.

   But what about the adapter? With UDMA modes, you will not get away with
programming the device to a faster mode than the adapter supports. FIFO
overruns is the first failure possibility that comes to my mind.

   Note that -X 66 means UDMA mode 2, not UDMA mode 4! Read the docs
carefully.
