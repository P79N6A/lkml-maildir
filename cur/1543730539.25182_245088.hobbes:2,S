This would normally be 2.6.9(.w). I did not point it out but Linus said 
-rc kernels.
Lately there has been some talk about removing deprecated features (eg. 
devfs, cryptoloop) which makes me think. Linus, is there a chance that 
there will be a x.y.z.W release of an old kernel after the next x.y.Z.w 
has been released and no longer is -rc? For example releasing a 2.6.8.2 
after 2.6.9 has been released and no longer is a 2.6.9-rcX.
In this case Kevin would have a point.
