Look for things switched on clustered_apic_mode - some of it is
specific to IBM NUMA-Q (and should probably be switched on
something else that's also triggered by CONFIG_MULTIQUAD),
but most of it is switching to clustered APIC mode.
If you have another machine that uses this mode, feel free to
mail me any questions you have about what I did.
Martin.
