Well, only two words from me.  Oh Shit.
The 2.5.70 ARM patch currently looks like this:
 343 files changed, 45388 insertions(+), 7341 deletions(-)
and I don't see that this will be reducing in size now that 2.6 is around
the corner.
I _know_ ARM stuff doesn't build and hasn't built in Linus' tree for a
fair time now - there are some generic changes to support ARM modules
needed in vmalloc.c which I just haven't had the time to sort out, and
there's still the issue of whether /proc/kcore actually works or not,
and now I see that the time stuff needs re-working for multiple ARM
platforms yet again.  (yes, all the other architectures got updated,
except for ARM.)
Maybe I should just forget even attempting to merge upstream, like most
of the ARM community doesn't.
Frustrated such an understatement.
