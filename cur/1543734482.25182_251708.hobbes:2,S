Argh ... undo Andi's patch that undid Brent's patch that undid Andi's API ...
It was Linus' bk tree, not Andrew's *-mm tree, that needed the
"--maxnode" put back in.  Andrew's tree already has the "--maxnode"
that it should have in the "get_nodes()" routine.
If you apply Andi's patch to Andrew's *-mm tree, then a second nearby
similar looking routine "get_zonemask()" gets the second "--maxnode",
and she doesn't build anymore, failing with:
  mm/mempolicy.c: In function `get_zonemask':
  mm/mempolicy.c:419: error: `maxnode' undeclared (first use in this function)
This applies on top of 2.6.9-rc1-mm5.
