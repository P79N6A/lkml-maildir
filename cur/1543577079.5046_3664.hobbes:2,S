Recompile as 'generic' as you can get. Pretend you have a '486. Use
a known good 'C' compiler even though it may not be 'optimum'. Once
this boots okay, try compiling for a Pentium '586' etc. You may
have found some problem with CPU identification.
A quick hack at the possibility of a BIOS reporting the wrong amount
of memory is to put append="mem=16m" in your LILO config just to
pretend that you only have 16 megabytes of RAM. Assuming you have
more than 16 megabytes, if the machine boots, you have isolated the
problem to bad BIOS reporting.
Step-by-step, using these kinds of tricks, you should be able to
find the problem.
