Well, drivers that depend on external, non-redistributable firmware
(aka ipw2200/ipw2100) already are evil, but at least I do not run
untrusted code on my CPU. (And yes, firmware in ipw2200 crashes a
_lot_).
Plus, that regulatory daemon probably contains security hole (or two)
inside, and I can't properly audit it. (Yes, firmware in ipw2200
probably contains security holes, too, but at least those are more
"interesting" to exploit).
And... Intel will not even tell you WTF that daemon does. They claim
it is for FCC, but it seems to be doing more than that. So maybe I'm
not _that_ paranoid.
(Of course, binary-only kernel module would be even uglier).
Ouch and binary-only daemon will conviently prevent me from using that
wireless card in ppc machine.
