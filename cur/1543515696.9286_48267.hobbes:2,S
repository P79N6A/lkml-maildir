I'm happy that the "apm=off" option does exist:
This will allow that the user will always have a way to get
the best realtime performance out of Linux.
In future it would be nice to have GUI tools for dummies which
let you tune the performance of the kernel in order to suit your needs:
for example "tune for realtime performance"
turns APM off and turns on DMA / unmaskirq /32bit access 
on all EIDE device.
It seems trivial but  these settings really increase
the lowlatency performance by orders of magnitude.
( in the case of my DVD drive (untuned/tuned), the
latencies went down from 70ms  to 2ms  = 35times.
