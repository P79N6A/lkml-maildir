It could also be a processor bug.  Maybe they're meant to guarantee
Program Order but get it wrong.  This stuff is complex; I heard they use
formal verification techniques to get the cache coherency protocols
right.  Yet they change it from stepping to stepping (why else wouldn't
different steppings be compatible).  Even formal techniques can have
bugs :-)
