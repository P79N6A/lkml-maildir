Subject: Mtrr problem on via M10000 with 2.6.0-test3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/15/50

Every time, X (4.3.99.10) reports at starting:
(WW) via(0): "Failed to setup write-combining range(0xe4000000,0x4000000)
The same error appears with vesa driver too.
I enabled mtrr in kernel and tried
less /proc/mtrr
...
reg03: base=0e40000000 (3648MB), size= 8MB: write-combining, count=1
The values seem right.
I also tried to change the ram amount for the video card (8-64) on bios and
it'll report correctly.
The problem is present at least since 2.6.0-test1, and with all X
versions.
Some other informations: I'm using gentoo and loaded via_agp and
agpgart, apart the error X runs nicely at first but after some time it
freeze all (telnet not responding).
Thanks for any hints or help.
