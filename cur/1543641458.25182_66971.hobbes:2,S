Actually it happened after the decission of not using NVidia drivers any
longer. I didn't insmod them in this session and at the time of the crash
I was happy to reach 10 days uptime (the system crashed quite often
before, every 3 to 7 days, and completely locked, so I had no chance to
get to know what these crashes were caused by).
So, NVidia wasn't the problem, but maybe VMWare. I shut VMware down a few
hours before the first Oops occured.

PS:
One of the `crash|lock types' that happened most often is when the system/pci
bus is on high load, e.g. copying some big files from one partition to
another one while watching TV with xawtv (standard bttv driver); or while
using "transcode" (converting video files) and whatching TV or whatching
movies. It's always the same that the system locks while reading/writing
(might be only one of those operations) to the hard disk; the HD LED keeps
on.
Maybe this is related to VIAs hardware in some way, I don't know but'd
like to. :)
