This somehow resembles the scatter-gatter lists already used in some 
subsystems such as the SCSI sg driver. 
BTW you have to make these pages Copy-On-Write before this procedure 
starts because you wouldn't want it to accidently fill the zero page, 
i.e. the VM will have to supply a unique set of pages otherwise it 
messes up.
