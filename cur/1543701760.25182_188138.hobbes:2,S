Regardless, Tomas's patch changed CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT for
that CPU, and CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT shouldn't affect this.
The cacheline size is determined at boottime using the code in
pcibios_init() and set using pci_generic_prep_mwi().
The config option is the default that pci_cache_line_size starts at,
but this gets overridden when the CPU type is determined.
