Maybe it's a sign that the people who *would* be able to contribute have  
all looked at the problem already (surely most people are annoyed how a  
reboot interrupts everything), and have already concluded for themselves  
that it's not possible with reasonable effort ... but there is a steady  
influx of new people who don't understand enough of the problem and have  
to ask.
What I'd *really* like (but don't see how to get there) would be a "save  
system state, shutdown, change kernel and/or hardware, reboot, restore  
state" system (where state is like "I'm logged in on this console, in this  
current directory, and under X I have Netscape running and this page  
displayed" but I don't care about the exact state of Squid or even if my  
ISDN line is dialled in, because those "fix themselves").
I suspect to do this right would need a means of storing per-process state  
controlled by the process (because only that process knows what needs to  
be saved, and what can easily be reconstructed - for example, open file  
descriptors to a place where we store cookies don't need to be saved, just  
routinely reopened), and then every user-visible non-transient program  
needs to implement it - and I don't see *that* happen in the next ten  
years.
But it *does* have the advantage of not needing to save kernel-internal  
state.
