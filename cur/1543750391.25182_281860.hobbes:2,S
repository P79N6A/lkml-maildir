Ok. Then, if the average packet(qave) does not exceed the threshhold, that is, the
packet has not been dropped, it will be enqueued into the physical queue, right?
So we can't see the different process of scheduling packets which are from
different kinds of traffic, we just know which packet might be dropped, right?

Thank you very much!
