I've been using linux 2.6. IPSec myself for quite some time and never
seen this. Hmm. What kind of tunnel is this? How large are the packets
involved?
Can you send me your .config and tell me what compiler was used, and
perhaps the object files in your kernel crypto/ directory?

What kind of address is this? Something random? The ESP code uses
in-place decryption, so this should point on the stack.
