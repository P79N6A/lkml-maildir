Say, as long as we're on the subject of supporting servers
that don't support TCP mounts, I've found the following
patch neccessary to support servers that don't support
TCP even for enumrating services.  (Hint: some operating systems
have an arbitrary limit on TCP sessions.)
Tested in busybox nfsmount, rediffed against util-linux-2.12pre,
compiles ok.  I don't know if the change in meaning of the
udp mount option is a good idea in general, but it sure helped
us here.
