Oddly, that's what the rest of the community is for.  Developers don't
have access to all possible combinations of hardware.
However, the patch to ti113x.h came from 2.4-ac, and afaik there haven't
been any reports of failure there.  Also note that I was just the middle
man in getting the original patch applied.
