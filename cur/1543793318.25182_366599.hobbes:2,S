For read modify write?
The point is to make the cache line dirty so that the
memory controller will write the data back.
The interesting sequence is:
lock; addl $0, %(reg)
I'm not actually sure the lock is even necessary.  Mostly this is
for brain-dead chipsets, chipsets you can't trust, or at least
chipsets that won't do a background scrub for you.
I don't think it is possible to do an uncached read modify write?
