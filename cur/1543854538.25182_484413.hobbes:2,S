So there is only one writer at the moment the hang was happening? 
hmm, is the filesystem relatively all being used or reserved, i.e, the
free bits are all being reserved?  There is one extreme case that may
cause starvation. If filesystem free blocks are all being reserved, when
a  new writer need a free block, it has to go through the entire
filesystems, try to reserve a space, which will repeatly calling
rsv_window_add and rsv_window_remove, since. Finally give up and fall
back to allocation without reservation. But this is all theory, not sure
fits your case here.
