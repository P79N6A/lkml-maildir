You can run into line-buffer limits with many such expressions. It would
be nice for someone, who is a shell-script guru, to modify the Makefile
so that 'modules_install' is done just like the other stuff so there
is always a ../linux/modules directory with a Makefile in it that
(only) handles installing modules in an efficient way with few, if
any side-effects, using as much of the built-ins as possible.
Cheers,
