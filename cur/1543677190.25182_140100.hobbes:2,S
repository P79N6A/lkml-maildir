Sorry for the slow response - I guess Pavel didn't notice your question
either. In it's current form in the 2.5 kernel, swsusp is stable enough
to try encrypting the data. However you might want to wait as the 2.4
version is nearly at its 1.0 release, and the plan is for me to then
start submitting a whole swag of patches that will make the code much
more feature complete. The 2.4 code includes support for compressing the
image; I guess we'd want to hook encryption in at the same point (it
will use BIO calls, not the swap read/write routines).
Regards,
Nigel
