The new system has some ups and downs. The biggest "down", 
which is that of RAW mode not being available anymore (it's 
emulated!) could be circumvented by having both the RAW and 
translated codes move between layers.
Concerning GPM vs kernel support for mice, maybe we can hope 
for a merging of the efforts and a reduction of code 
duplication, if there is any?
Overall, I think that the new system *could* be a good starting 
point, but it still needs a *lot* of work.
(Now, if we could have any reply from the maintainers?)
