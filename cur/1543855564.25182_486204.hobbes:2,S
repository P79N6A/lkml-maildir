I find a bug in kernel 2.6.18.3
with ethernet card:
4.1 Ethernet card
    -- Networking support
        Networking options -->
            Ethernet (1000 Mbit) -->
                 Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8001 Gigabit Ethernet Controller 
There are problems with ethernet card when booting to different system, e.g. from linux to M$ win - system is not able to connect to network. instead of re-boot you have to shutdown box and after that turn on. 
I running slackware 11 with kernel 2.6.18.3
root@segfault:/home/buzz# uname -a
Linux segfault 2.6.18.3 #2 Tue Nov 28 08:10:19 BRST 2006 i686 athlon-4 i386 GNU/Linux
