Unfortunately, I didn't check thoroughly to see if duplicate files were
listed by ls.  I wish I had known to look!  This is my production
workstation.  It needed to get back up and running, so I didn't save
the "evidence." :^(

My problem was clearly related to fsck.ext3 which ran automatically upon
a reboot.  Before that, no problems whatsoever.  After the boot-time
fsck was over, the system failed to finish coming up.  The boot output
contained the surprising error "Can't find /etc/fstab" and complained
about the rc script being missing (entire /etc/rc2.d dir was gone).

Neither do I (not enough in-depth knowledge to know), but that info may
be of use to Ted and Marcelo(?)  If my conclusions about 2.4.20-rc3 and
some e2fsprogs tools being incompatable are erroneous, my apologies.
