Sorry, I didn't know.  (And evidently several other people on the LKML
didn't know either... :)  Does that mean that development is finished
on the 2.4 tree, or will it switch back to accepting patches at some
future time?  There's quite a lot in the Documentation/ directory that
could be improved (as you probably know:).

Ged.
