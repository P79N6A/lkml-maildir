2TB is the limit for all block devices in 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.  This is
from 2^32 * 512 byte sectors.  Using LVM or MD devices will not overcome
this limitation.
There was a patch floating around which extended the block counts to
64-bit ints (Jens Axboe and/or Ben LaHaise posted it), and I think at
least part of it is in 2.5.  Even if you have 64-bit block counts,
there are other issues which pop up fairly soon - 32-bit page indexes
and other 32-bit overflows in calculations in the ext2 code.  There
is definitely a hard limit at 16TB for 4kB block ext2 filesystems,
but I suspect you will have problems at 8TB even after the 2TB block
device limit is lifted.

You could always try it on a real 64-bit machine to see if that helps.
You can concievably use 8kB blocks on an Alpha, giving you an upper
limit of 32TB for the filesystem until the ext2 extent code is
implemented (which will give us 64-bit block numbers among other things).
