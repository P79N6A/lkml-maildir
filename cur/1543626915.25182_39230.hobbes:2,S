In times past when people were working on the vm86 system call you needed
a modified version of insmod, that could read System.map.
If you are going to be doing strange things I don't see why that shouldn't
still be required.
Though I am wondering if the sane approach for a profiler might not to be
have a kernel conditional compilation directive that simply patches
the syscall path.  The overhead is probably less as well.
