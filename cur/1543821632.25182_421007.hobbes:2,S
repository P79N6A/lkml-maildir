Apparently you have a huge filesystem (374936503 blocks - about 1.5 TB,
if these are 4KB blocks).  reiserfsck --rebuild-tree works by reading
every data block on the filesystem, finding blocks which look like
reiserfs tree nodes and rebuilding the tree from that nodes - so it
would take a long time, even if the volume was almost empty.

reiserfsck may need lots of memory (especially with such a huge FS) ...

... and you have only 512 MB with no swap.  Try to add some swap space -
then reiserfsck might eventually complete.
AFAIK, the only way to recover reiserfs after --rebuild-tree has been
attempted is to run "reiserfsck --rebuild-tree" to completion.
