What it should do is change based on whether devfs is mounted or not.  It
doesn't make *any* sense to have /dev/ide/host0/foo/bar in your
/proc/partitions entries if you aren't mounting devfs.  The /proc/partitions
entry is the only way I know of for something like LVM to determine which
devices to scan for Volume Groups.  If you can't read /proc/partitions, it
has to attempt to scan all block devices it recognizes, regardless of
whether they are actually on the system or not.  This can take several
minutes.
