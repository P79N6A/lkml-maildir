Ah, what a sweet way of getting rid of my nemesis :-)
The requeuing code troubled me quite a bit with umlsim, which
makes all kinds of calls from the idle task, including calls to
try_to_wake_up, or functions that eventually call it. Naturally,
whenever the requeuing was used, it tripped over current->array.
(And even with a fake array, it would have had ill effects.)
So the requeuing didn't do anything for processes other than the
idle task ?
