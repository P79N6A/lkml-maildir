Well my nforce2 worked with 2.6.8 and earlier, and I believe it was even
fine with 2.6.10 and 2.6.11, but certainly 2.6.12 ran rather awful time
sync wise, and 2.6.14 appears so far to be running a little fast,
although I can't say for sure.  It is much better than 2.6.12 was.  It
may be that 2.6.14 is running correctly, but that the previous drift has
caused something to need to be realigned.

I was seeting WAY more drift than that with 2.6.12.
