The current architected interface for this routine is to return
the error code as generated by firmware, and not an error code that
might be gen'ed during call execution.  If we change this convention,
then we'd have to audit all 68 uses of this routine to see if any
are affected, and fix the ones that are.  This is a potentially 
error-prone process. Also, the likelyhood of having a failed rtas
call is supposed to be very small (ideally never), to hava a failed
call *and* be out of memory to record the failure seems dim ... 
the benefit doesn't seem worth it.
