(Sorry, don't have Jan's message.)
The real issue is not that, but that David doesn't have write access to
Linus' published tree.  Neither should he because he could contaminate
Linus' published tree with the MTD tree, or introduce some unreviewed
patch which gave him backdoor access via the kernel.
(Of course, David's unlikely to do either, but that's not really the
point.)
