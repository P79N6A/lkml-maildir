Ok. It does seem like the debugger is using the TF bit in the debuggee to 
"remember" whether it was single-stepping or not.
Which is pretty insane.

Not really. Except you should just remember that you asked for 
single-stepping. That, together with the status return on the wait (which 
tells you why the process stopped - the single-step could have been 
aborted because of a real fault), should be plenty good enough, and sounds 
like the natural way to do this.
Relying on the TF bit, which is under the control of the debugged 
application itself, is kind of hokey.
So your patch isn't too intrusive, which is nice. The thing that _isn't_ 
nice about it is that it means that the debugger cannot actually set the 
TF bit "for real" on the process it is debugging, and it cannot really ask 
for what the state of the TF bit is (because it will be overshadowed by 
the debugger single-stepping).
So I like your patch because it re-instates old (admittedly broken) 
behaviour without breaking the _internal_ kernel logic (just the "external 
interface"). And while the old behaviour _was_ broken, being backwards 
compatible is damn important.
That said, I'd be a lot happier if we could just fix Kylix instead ;(
