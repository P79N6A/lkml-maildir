I don't know how the Matrox cards work so I couldn't comment, although
presumably having code to support multiple monitors on multiple cards
would at least make it _easier_ to support dual head video adaptors.
Also, presumably if you could assign virtual consoles to either monitor
and they both behaved like the standard primary console there'd be no
particular reason why X shouldn't run on one or both as normal...
