Chances are your hardware is one that doesn't play well with dynticks then. 
Compile in the timer info and use the timertop utility to see if there really 
is something increasing your timer activity to 450HZ and if there isn't then 
it's a problem with dynticks and your hardware. This is the problem I'm 
currently seeing on SMP configs (too many HZ) and I have yet to figure out 
what it is about the IO APIC that makes this happen.
