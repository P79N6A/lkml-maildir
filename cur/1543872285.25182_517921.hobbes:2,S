uart_startup() is called when something opens a serial port.  There's
two points which that happens:
1. when you have serial console enabled, and the kernel opens /dev/console
   before starting userspace.
2. when userspace opens a serial port.
If you're not using a serial console (and you don't have an utterly broken
/dev nodes - iow incorrect /dev/console entry), then (1) doesn't apply.
