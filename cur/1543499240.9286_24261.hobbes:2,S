Subject: Massive e2fs corruption with 2.2.9/10?

Is anyone else seeing this?  I've got a box that has been running stable
for around 9 months, and now in the span of a few weeks it has eaten
itself twice.
It starts out with readdir errors, then I get errors about attempting to
read past end of device, and then if I try to shutdown and run e2fsck,
it never finishes.
The first time this happened, I used "mke2fs -S /dev/sda9; e2fsck -f
/dev/sda9" and managed to recover most of the lost stuff, but this time
it is really hosed (I've lost basically all of /usr/local, which is
where the non-Red Hat stuff, including my home directory, were).
This is an AMD K6-2 333 with 64 MB RAM, an Adaptec 2940, and a 3Com
3c905 network card.  I have a 4G Seagate Barracuda (the 3.5"x1" version)
that is /local and holds my local Red Hat mirror and a few other things
like that (it doesn't change much) that seems to not have been affected.
The main drive for everything else is an old half height 3.5" Barracuda
(ST12550N).  At first I thought the drive was dying (but I didn't get
any SCSI errors), so I replaced it with a spare drive of the same model,
and now it has died again.
Would any of the changes in the aic7xxx driver have somehow had a bad
interaction with this drive and caused this?
This is frustrating, because I was preparing to put 2.2.x on all of my
servers (this is an ISP).  I've been running 2.2.6 on my news server
(much different load) for several months and it is running great, but I
don't want to put a newer kernel on anything until I am _sure_ it is
stable.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
