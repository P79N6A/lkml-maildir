These are passed to the kernel.

This controls when a filesystem is mounted, same category as '_netdev'

These control who can mount the filesystem, same category as 'user' and 'users'

I can't find these in the manual as universal options.  Quiet is
defined for a couple of filesystems but with different meaning for
each of them.

Yes, slightly.  Actually most of these options are just ignored on the
command line.  They only have an affect in /etc/fstab.
The right behavior of mount(8) would probably be to error out on these
options, since they make no sense on the command line.  But this is
not a kernel issue.
