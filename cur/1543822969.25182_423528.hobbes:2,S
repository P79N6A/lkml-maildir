Subject: [RFC PATCH 2.6.17-rc4 0/6] Kernel memory leak detector
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/13/91

This is the first attempt at a kernel memory leak detector based on
the tracing garbage collection technique (similar to Valgrind's
"memcheck --leak-check" tool). See the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file
for a more detailed description.
The implementation is not complete and the code might contain
bugs. Only the ARM and i386 architectures are supported at the moment.
Let me know what you think. Thanks.
