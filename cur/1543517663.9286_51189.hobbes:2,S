The PCI specs do not require explicitely that the device dependent
configuration space can be read without side effect. All SYMBIOS chips up
to the SYM53C895 have IO registers window (so with read side effects)
mapped at offset 128 of their PCI configuration space -> bad luck.  Btw,
these chips donnot conflict with the specs, but may-be such a feature was
not expected by the guys that wrote the PCI specs. :-) 
Latest SYM53C896 and SYM53C1010 have no longer IO registers mapped into 
the PCI configuration space and so are quite safe for PCI configuration
space read.
