Here's another grungy thing I needed to do to PCI. Multi-headed video
cards don't really implement independent PCI devices even though they
look like independent devices. I've heard that this behavior is needed
for MS Windows compatibility.
I'm missing a PCI call to claim ownership for the secondary device
without also causing a second instance of my driver to be loaded.
Here's the code I'm using, what's the right way to do this?
struct pci_dev *secondary;
/* check the next function on the same card */
secondary = pci_find_slot(dev->pdev->bus->number, dev->pdev->devfn +
1);
if (secondary) {
	/* check if class is secondary video */
	if (secondary->class == 0x038000) {
		DRM_DEBUG("registering secondary video head\n");
		/* This code is need to bind the driver to the secondary device */
		/* There is no direct pci call to do this, there should be one */
		secondary->dev.driver = dev->pdev->dev.driver;
		device_bind_driver(&secondary->dev);
		/* dev->pdev->driver is not filled until after probe completes */
		secondary->driver = to_pci_driver(dev->pdev->dev.driver);
		pci_dev_get(secondary);
	}
}
