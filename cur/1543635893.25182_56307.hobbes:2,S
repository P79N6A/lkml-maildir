Please stop calling ATAPI as SCSI over IDE, it is not. It is Packet

Did you ever looks at the ATAPI specs?
ATAPI _is_ SCSI over IDE with a few "bugs"/deviations:
-	The inquiry format uses wrong protocol version numbers.
	This mainly gives provblems with creating Mode sense / mode select
	commands. If you know (e.g. from MMC-3) that the transport is
	IDE, then you just bump the version to 2 and it works.
-	6-byte SCSI commands in general are not supported. This is not
	a real problem for a well designed high level driver.
-	Commands that take a long time are allowed to behave as if
	the high level code did set the IMMED bit in the CDB.
	This can be handled if the high level code handles the
	resulting error codes for the following commands to 
	introduce a wait loop.
-	There is no disconnect/reconnect.
	This is nothing that high level code should be aware of.
