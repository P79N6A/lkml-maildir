Reading through the patch its:
1) Not against any mainline kernel
2) Not against a recent kernel
There were a number of backlight class changes just merged into mainline
and you need to sync up any patch against them.
As mentioned by others, there is no need to tie the backlight driver
into the framebuffer any more. Have a look at
drivers/video/backlight/corgi_bl.c for an example (its used by PXA
devices).
I have said elsewhere I will take patches to make corgi_bl a more
generic driver (or maybe create a simple generic backlight driver) along
the lines of what Paul mentioned.

Richard
