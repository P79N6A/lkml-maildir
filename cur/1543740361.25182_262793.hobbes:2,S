Your /sbin/init can be a simple script (or even just bash or another shell).
You can use statically compiled binaries against dietlibc from here:
ftp://foobar.math.fu-berlin.de:2121/pub/dietlibc/bin-i386/
If you use "ash" as /sbin/init and place busybox there with the 
appropriate symlinks, you get a small semi-functional shell for a mere 
120kb of executables.
If you're really desperate for space, you can build your own executable 
that asks for shutdown/reboot and calls reboot(2) with the appropriate 
parameters, and link against dietlibc (or ulibc).
This is not really kernel related and you should not mess with the 
kernel code for acomplishing this. If you really need to cut down extra 
space in the kernel you can check the patches from the "tiny" tree to 
build an incredibly small kernel.
I hope this helps,
