Heh. I'm really hoping that nobody will cry themselves to sleep over MSI 
not being enabled..

Nope, the same thing happened to "HDA Intel" when it was an MSI interrupt 
(ie before I applied the change that made it not use MSI by default).
So I think it's either: (a) irqbalance doesn't balance MSI interrupts at 
all or (b) the MSI interrupt code doesn't honor balancing requests even if 
it does.
I didn't look any closer. It's not like it's a huge problem for me (or 
likely for anybody else), but it was interesting to see another 
"unintended consequence" of the "use MSI or not" choice.
The suspend problem reported by Stephen is another such thing - where MSI 
itself wasn't a problem, but stupid (probably broken) firmware code at 
wakeup broke it by an unforseen interaction. Again, that is probably 
related to the fact that nobody has ever really tested it (ie firmware 
"engineers" obviously didn't actually ever test anything with MSI enabled 
and in use, and there really is no excuse for firmware messing with the 
MSI setting - other than the usual "firmware is inevitably buggy" thing).
