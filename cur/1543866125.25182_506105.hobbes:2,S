Hi,
Please consider pulling the following GFS2 & DLM changes. They are as per
the patches posted recently on lkml, except for three minor changes
(two small bug fixes and a function which should have been static) which
are marked with [*] in the list below. All the other patches have
been in -mm, most of them for a number of weeks. None of the patches touch
any code outside the gfs2 and dlm directories,
Steve.
