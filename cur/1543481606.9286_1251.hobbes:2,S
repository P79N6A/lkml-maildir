The `physical geometry' is no more real than the `logical geometry' -
it's just the drive's lies rather than the BIOS's lies.
Today's hard drives divide the disk surface into concentric zones with
differing numbers of sectors-per-track.  This is hardly a new trick,
but it still makes it impossible to describe the geometry in C/H/S
terms even without the stupid limitations on those numbers.
