There's at least two reasons why having it in the driver is preferable:
- synchronizing sending the fake ARP request with when the device is
  operational -- you really want to make this well synchronized to keep
  unreachability as short as possible, especially when doing live
  migration
- anybody but the guest might not know (all) the MAC addresses for which
  to send a fake ARP request
