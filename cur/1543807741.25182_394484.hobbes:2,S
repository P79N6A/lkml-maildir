The problem is that AC or DC is not a generic property of backlights but
specific to your problematic hardware case. You're going to have a to
find a way to tell if its running on AC or not to report the right value
in the manner the class requires.
I can't see how you plan to add "generic support for displaying separate
AC and DC brightnesses" without destroying the point of the class (which
for the brightness parameter is to display the current backlight
brightness).
