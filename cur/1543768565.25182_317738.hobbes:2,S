Either you use cogito and just pass cg-clone an HTTP URL (to the git
repository as in the case of rsync -
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito.git
 should work), or you
invoke git-http-pull directly (passing it desired commit ID of the
remote HEAD you want to fetch, and the URL; see
Documentation/git-http-pull.txt).
