Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core fixes against 2.6.25-rc2 git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/21/423

Here are a few driver core fixes against your current git tree that fix some
more problems that have cropped up:
	- shutdown problem due to logic problem with cpufreq usage of
	  kobjects.
	- build fix for powerpc due to previous kobject changes.
	- runtime errors when CONFIG_SYSFS=n
	- UIO code now works properly from my previous messups
	- proper encoding of the ja_JP stable_kernel_rules.txt file
	- updates to the stable_kernel_rules.txt file
	- mark ide=reverse as obsolete in preparation of 2.6.26 (Bart
	  wanted this to go in through my tree as I have the .26 patches
	  pending.)
	- other minor fixes.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
