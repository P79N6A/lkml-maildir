Subject: [patch 07/13] powerpc: work around a cell interrupt HW bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Apparently we have found a bug in the CPU that causes
external interrupts to sometimes get disabled indefinitely.
This adds a workaround for the problem.
