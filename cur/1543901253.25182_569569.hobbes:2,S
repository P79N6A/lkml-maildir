Actually, I disagree.  English *is* the second language learned in
school for most European developers (except, obviously, the ones from
the British isles), and we don't have that problem.

What we have found in Europe, is that that it has limited value, and
that the closer to the core you are, the less value it is, because at
that stage you should be communicating more with other developers.
Putting yourself behind a wall of translation is unfortunately a
