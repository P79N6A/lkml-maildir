Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello all -
I posted these patches a while ago, and let them fall by the wayside.
The following 3 patches, combined with the userspace patches referenced below,
implement hotplug events for open firmware/macio devices such as apple airport
wireless ethernet cards.
* 01-openfirmware-device-table.diff
  - Converts struct of_match to a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE-compatible
    struct of_device_id
  - Uses the information to generate a device table parsable by
    depmod(8)
* 02-openfirmware-sysfs.diff
  - Exports openfirmware variables via sysfs so that coldplug can read and
    take appropriate action
* 03-openfirmware-hotplug.diff
  - Adds the hotplug routine for generating hotplug events. Uses the
    information published to provide the hotplug environment variables to
    userspace.
In addition to the kernel patches, userspace patches for hotplug and
module-init-tools are also required. These patches, including the kernel
patches, are available here:
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/jeffm/linux/macio-hotplug/
I'd appreciate any comments.
