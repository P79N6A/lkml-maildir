Ok so whats wrong with embedded kiovec points into somethign bigger, one
kmalloc can allocate two arrays, one of buffers (shared with networking etc)
followed by a second of block io completion data.
Now you can also kind of cast from the bigger to the smaller object and get
the right result if the kiovec array is the start of the combined allocation
