Hi
Im having problems with 2.2.13pre9. I have 2.2.12 presently running but
may have added more options into my 2.2.13pre9 build. At the moment the
only patch is freeswan. Im about to also remove this but think its
completely unrelated to this problem. (im slowly removing various things
to find out what the problem is but is painstakingly slow :)
the error message on boot is this
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3
 hdb: hdb1
[MS-DOS FS Rel. 12,FAT 0, check=n,conv=b,uid=0,gid=0,umask=022,bmap]

Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 3:01
probably not very helpful is it
All harddrives in the machine at the moment are using ext2fs. I also tried
removing fat and compiling it as a module but still get the panic just not
the fat messages along with it.
What can I try to get some slightly more helpful information? I have
tried using ikd but cannot find sufficient documentaion describing how to
use it.
Thanks for any help
