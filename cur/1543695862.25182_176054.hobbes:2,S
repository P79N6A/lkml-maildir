No, I'm not certain that mpg321 (or any other app, though there's 
next-to-nothing else running) is leak-free.

But wouldn't "cp $file /tmp/ramdisk0; mpg321 /tmp/ramdisk0/$file" accomplish 
the same thing?  (I've done that.)

Actually, I don't scan the disk to find random albums; I have a text file 
that contains a list of every album's full path, and I pick a random line 
from that file.  So only the selected album's directory gets scanned.  And 
the mp3 partition is mounted read-only (I should have mentioned that 
before), so the atimes shouldn't be getting written as it is.

Maybe I will give that a try.
So I'm guessing that there isn't actually a way to manually move buffer-data 
out of RAM?
