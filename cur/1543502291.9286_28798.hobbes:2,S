Thanks for writing back-- I thought about these same things when I first
wrote the patch...

I thought about doing something like this, but I think it would end up
being more overhead than it is worth. I don't think that it is
unreasonable to say "don't run any old statically linked binaries as root
if you have more than 65,535 users". Anyway, this approach can't catch all
problems- what if someone's code uses a short int internally but is linked
against glibc?

Again, when/if 32-bit UIDs become standard in Linux, I don't think _any_
of the typical distributions would include any programs intended to be run
as root that are not linked against glibc.
