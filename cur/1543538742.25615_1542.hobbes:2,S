	I think alot of it comes down to hardware choice.  There
seemed to be many more driver vs SMP issues with 2.0.3x, and some SMP
support that 2.2.x did better when dealing with interesting SMP setups
(some compaqs, ALR/Unisys/DataGeneral PProx4 and PProx6 units/etc).
	Pick known clean running MBs, and cards and you did well,
catalog engineer the system without researching what was stable with
SMP and get bitten hard.
