A couple support calls later, I think I've come around to your point
of view.  This patch isn't needed and may cause confusion.
Few aoe users really use partitions on their aoe disks, so I can make
the aoe driver have one minor number per disk as the default to avoid
the most common problems people encounter.
Then, aoe users who really need to partition their network disks can
use the partitionable md driver to "wrap" the aoe disk, like this:
  mdadm -B -l linear --force -n 1 --auto=mdp /dev/md_p0 /dev/etherd/e7.0
  fdisk /dev/md_p0
