I've created the delta patch below for sched/urgent - i've been testing 
the previous version already. Mike, do you agree with this splitup?

Subject: [PATCH] sched: fix SCHED_IDLE latency/starvation, v2
The below seems to cure all of the problems I've encountered.
The rate of advance thing in set_task_cpu() seems to have been a case of
fixing the symptom instead of the problem.  Perhaps this needs more
thought, but my box says "Red-Herring" ;-)
The real problem (excluding the SCHED_IDLE specific problems), is that
update_min_vruntime() doesn't work quite as intended, and will slam
min_vruntime far right if load balancing etc places a task which is far
right of the currently running task on the runqueue.  If the currently
running, and up to this point the min_vruntime pace setter, is a hog,
any task waking to this runqueue after min_vruntime leaps forward has to
wait for the hog to consume the gap.  In the case of SCHED_IDLE tasks,
that gap can be huge, but even with a nice 19 tasks it can be quite
large and painful.
Removing the if (vruntime == cfs_rq->min_vruntime) test, which will be
true if the currently running task is the pace setter, cured it for me.
