I would suggest a slight modification: make "max_mapped" grow as the
priority goes up.
Right now max_mapped is fixed at "nr_pages*10".
You could have something like
	max_mapped = nr_pages * 60 / priority;
instead, which might also alleviate the problem with not even bothering to
scan much of the inactive list simply because 99% of all pages are mapped.
That way you don't waste time on looking at the rest of the inactive list
until you _need_ to.
