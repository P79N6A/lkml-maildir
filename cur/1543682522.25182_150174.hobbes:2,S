Again I cannot keep up with the mailing list.  If anyone wishes to advise or
has questions, please kindly contact me directly.
In addition to my previous message quoting myself, I lied yet again:

[...]

I read the two README files.  BOTH OF THE GZIPPED TARBALLS
PRODUCE THE SAME EXECUTABLE FILENAMES, such as insmod.
If I can get both of them to build, how can I guess which one to install?
Besides, I tried building module-init-tools-0.9.11a even after its configure
script failed.  There are a lot more differences than just the type of cpu,
from the compilation options when trying "rpm --rebuild".  For example no -D
options for combining various stuff, no URL to explain tainting, etc.  Also
this one's "make install" doesn't install the lsmod command.
I really really lied.  I'll never figure out how to build these things
without help.  As I understand it, all I need at this point is the new
modutils for execution on an i586.
