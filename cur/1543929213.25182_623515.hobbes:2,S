Mmmm.. an update here:
Reverting the drivers/hid directory does seem to improve behaviour.
But right now I have a "make -j4" happening in the background
and the mouse is ever so erratic again, despite the drivers/hid reversion.
So it's a timing thing, somewhere.
Maybe a scheduling thing?
Jiri:  I know nothing about how mouse clicks are interpreted,
or even *where* or *how* double-click detection happens.
Until this started happening, I didn't even know which module
was the driver for my mouse (it's usbhid).
Can you give a short tutorial, to help us understand possible causes ?
