Only if user simultaneously uses oth interfaces and remove even from the
queue when it's copy was in mapped buffer, but in that case it's user's
problem (and if we do want, we can store pointer/index of the ring
buffer entry, so when event is removed from the ready queue (using 
kevent_get_events()), appropriate entry in the ring buffer will be
updated to show that it is no longer valid.

Have I missed something? It looks like the only problematic situation is
described above when user simultaneously uses both interfaces.
