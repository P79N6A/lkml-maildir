Why does it matter?  Seriously, do you have any reason to act
differently between a CD and a small DVD, either of which contains a
UDF filesystem?  If not, don't.
Size, type of filesystem, etc, are obviously important -- but
shouldn't be determined by the type of the physical media.  It's
perfectly legitimate to have a large ISO 9660 filesystem on a DVD, or
an UDF filesystem on a CD.
