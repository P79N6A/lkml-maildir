To clarify, I'm not suggesting that the "balance with cpu (x+1)%n only" 
algorithm is the only way to do this.  Rather, I'm pointing out that 
even an extremely simple algorithm can give you fair loading when you 
already have CFS managing the runqueues.  There are countless more 
sophisticated ways we could do this without using global locking, or 
possibly without any locking at all, other than the locking we already 
use during migration.
