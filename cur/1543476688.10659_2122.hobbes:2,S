I don't know which is zlatkos patch but my point is that it's
try_to_free_pages that has to care to be balanced and to do things at
best. I want to be allowed to ask try_to_free_pages to free any kind of
space and such function has to run _always_ efficient. 
My current free_user_and_cache() (arca-vm-13) is bad because it doesn't
swapout aggressively. I am fixing it right now. When I'll have finished
I'll post the new patch.
BTW, the reason pre6 is slower than my current _bad_ free_user_and_cache() 
(arca-vm-13) in low memory machines is that in high memory machines the
freepages.min is something like 255 while in low memory machines
freepages.min it's close to SWAP_CUSTER_MAX. So in low memory machines the
swapout cluster has to be reduced (because now swapout doesn't free
pages). free_user_and_cache() has to care about these issues and I see
plain wrong to hardwire the swap cluster size to a constant number since
the freepages values are dynamic (and also changable via sysctl).
I am not sure of all this, but this is currently my thought.
