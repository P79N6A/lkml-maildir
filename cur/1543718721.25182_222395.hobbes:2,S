Looks good! A few suggestions....
Might want to add support for /boot/System.map containing the version number 
(eg: /boot/System.map-`uname -r` ), if /boot/System.map doesn't exist, before 
just dropping out with an error.
For clarity, you might want to invert the "address  function ....." line to 
separate the header from the actual displayed data (like top does).
Having the total up in the header instead of at the end of the data might also 
be useful (eg: next to ticks perhaps?) as it's really a waste of a display 
line for 1 number.
Also a little more verbosity in the error messages would be good. 
eg:
 /proc/profile not found:
 You need to enable profiling support in your kernel to use kerneltop
 /proc/profile Permission Denied:
 You need to be root to run kerneltop
Hope these comments are useful.
