Hi, 
As the daystar sets, i try to play some with my new would be
firewall/server, but since this will be running for quite some time i
have been experimenting with powertop to find out what i can do to limit
it's power usage.
But, if i run powertop for too long or a few times to many... this

If i don't run powertop, it is rock solid... Compiling for hours,
running memtest for hours etc etc...
