I don't ;-) - I lived w/o IDE DMA until now so I guess I'll survive for another
while. Thanks for the help, though. I will try again with ALSA+PIO later in the
2.6.0-test stage, when the other aspects (fb and usb) will more-or-less be
usable for me for daily use.

It works fine (aside of the ancient floppy disk grifting terribly).
