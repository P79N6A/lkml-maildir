I am not bothered about the journal until there is fully working support 
for NTFS on Linux. After that I will start thinking about journalling.
I haven't noticed any changes between Win2k and WinXP except for the 
extension of the MFT_RECORD structure (see 
ntfs-driver-tng:linux/fs/ntfs/layout.h) to contain the mft record number 
(great data recovery info). Although it is confusing that they are only 
using 32 bits there as otherwise the mft record numbers are 48-bit. Not 
quite sure what to make of that...

 From what I have read I doubt the DOJ settlement will be any benefit to 
NTFS development on Linux but it's certainly worth a try.
Best regards,
Anton
