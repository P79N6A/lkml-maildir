This was our design goal for LSM: to be as minimally intrusive to the 
kernel as possible. We would LOVE to have a zero-footprint solution that 
allowed users to enable LSM when they need it. More precisely, LSM is 
that mechanism intended to impose as little overhead as possible with no 
modules loaded, and provide adequate access to the modules when they are 
loaded.
LSM is not zero-footprint, but it is as low as we could make it. We are 
interested in ways to reduce the footprint, but that reduction needs to 
be looked at in cost/benefit terms: changes that have very little impact 
on footprint, but high impact on the functionality of the LSM interface. 
If you remove this system call, you will save almost nothing in kernel 
resources, but do a lot of damage to functionality.
On the other hand, the complaints about the typing of the arguments are 
well taken, in the context of 32/64-bit porting issues. So what types 
should the arguments be? Abstractly, they are integers, in the 
mathematical sense. What is the preferred word-size-portalbe way to 
express that?
