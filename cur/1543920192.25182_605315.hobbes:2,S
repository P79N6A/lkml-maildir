Because PCI devices reorder their bus numbers all the time.  And we have
ethernet devices hanging off of USB connections now (yes, even built-in
to the machine), and we have network connections on other hot-pluggable
busses (remember, PCI is hot pluggable.)
So, the distros need to name network devices in a persistant way, that
is why the distros now do this.  If you don't like the distro doing it,
complain to them, it's not a kernel issue :)
