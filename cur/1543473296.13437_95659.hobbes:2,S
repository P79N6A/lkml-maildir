Um, tulip.c is old in the kernel.  Donald Becker's web page has a newer
driver(compiled with 2.1 w/ warnings).  I need this for my netcard.
In 2.2.0pre1, this is in tulip.c:
static const char *version = "tulip.c:v0.83 10/19/97 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
From becker's page:
static const char version[] = "tulip.c:v0.90 10/20/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov\n";
