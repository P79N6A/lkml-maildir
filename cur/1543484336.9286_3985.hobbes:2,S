Agreed.  2.0.x binary compatibility has been excellent from about 2.0.18
on.  With some notorious hiccoughs around 2.0.30.
I am essentially able to mix and match binary modules 80% of the time
between 2.0.25 and 2.0.36 (a little binary editing ..).  Not that I
recommend this practice, of course, ahem. But it makes no real
difference to a 3c509.o binary which 2.0.x kernel it's talking to.
It's the 20% that can't be done that way that makes it unacceptable.
