OK...  I confess, I am confused...
I see the comment stating that only one thread updates, hence no need
for locking.  But I can't find the readers!  There is a section of
code under rcu_read_lock(), but this same function updates the list
as well.  If there really is only one updater, then the rcu_read_lock()
is not needed, because rcu_read_lock() is only required to protect against
concurrent deletion.
Either way, in cfq_exit_io_context(), the list_for_each_safe_rcu() should
be able to be simply list_for_each_safe(), since this is apparently the
sole updater thread, so no concurrent updates are possible.
If only one task is referencing the list at all, no need for RCU or for
any other synchronization mechanism.  If multiple threads are referencing
the list, I cannot find any pure readers.  If multiple threads are updating
the list, I don't see how they are excluding each other.
Any enlightenment available?  I most definitely need a clue here...
