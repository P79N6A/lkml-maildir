Version numbers for drivers that can be built as modules are very
helpful for anyone wanting to upgrade a driver on top of a
distribution supported kernel.  If you always just use the latest
kernel source, you're right it doesn't help you.  But that's not
everyone.
This one skips two versions because I'm trying to sync up a 1.8
version tested internally with the 1.7+ upstream changes that's in the
kernel now.
I'll accept that the official policy is to not version modules when
MODULE_VERSION is removed :-)
