I recently bumped into this myself. It seems the NEC drive fails the
capabilites probe and the sense check only checks for invalid opcode,
where the probe will result in a invalid field in cdb. Could you try
this patch? Or get 2.2.7-ac1, which included it and lots of other
things for shutting up the SCSI CD-ROM subsystem a bit.
