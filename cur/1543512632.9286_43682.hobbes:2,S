Hi there,
While making the config file using make menuconfig I get the error
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
make -C scripts/lxdialog all
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog'
/usr/bin/ld: cannot open -lncurses: No such file or directory
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
>> Unable to find the Ncurses libraries.
>>
>> You must have Ncurses installed in order
>> to use 'make menuconfig'
make[1]: *** [ncurses] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog'
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 2
When actually I have ncurses installed. Is this a bug which has already been
patched ?? If so my mistake for not checking it. ;-)
TIA
Regards
	Avenger
