I keep getting this after the machine has been up for 30 days or so when
lots of users are on . Every user has separate quota.. 
I looked at the source and came to a conculsion that NR_DQUOTS in the
quota.h file can be changed to a higher #.. This strikes me as strange why
it wasn't a higher number in the first place.. I did however notice a few
more conditions that this no free error might occur so I am posting here to
ask if changing this value of NR_DQUOTS from 256 to 4096 will alleviate the
problem or is there anything else I should do?
Please CC Me on the e-mail as I am not a member of the list.
