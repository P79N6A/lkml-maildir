Hi Pierre, Tony and folks,
The patch series that follows is a synchronization of MMC OMAP driver
from Linux-OMAP tree into mainline tree.
Basically, it brings MMC multislot support for OMAP boards with one slot
(like H2 1611, H3 1710) or two slots (like H4 2420 and N800). Others
boards supported by such feature are: N770, Siemens SX1 and Apollon.
Improvements, fixes for some specific issues, code clean-ups and all are
included.
BR,
Carlos.
