Interesting. Can you try un-reverting that patch, and applying this one?
The reading of the status register is something that was part of the original
NVidia code, which I'm not really sure why is there. Given that reading
the status register clears the drive's interrupt status, that might be
causing some wierd interaction with the ADMA controller. Also, I added in
a printk for cases where notifiers are triggered but the command doesn't
indicate completion - if you still get problems, let me know if you see
that message.
