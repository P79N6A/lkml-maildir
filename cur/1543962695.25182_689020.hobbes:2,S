Hello; I have a question about the nopage function that was removed in
the kernel.
What would be the best way for me to build a module that has a nopage
funtion in it?
Right now I went and undid what you had done to the kernel,to atleast
have the module not give me errors,
but, am wondering if I should try to take the module and remove the
nopage function in it , and add the functions that is relevent.
to keep the module up-to date.
regards;
