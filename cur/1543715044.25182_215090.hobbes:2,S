as already stated,it can be. fdisk tries to refresh the kernel's copy of the 
table every time it writes, and hdparm -Z /dev/hdx does the same, but both 
will fail if any partitions are mounted from that disk. unmounting, then 
re-partitioning, then remounting lets it work... this is often useful to me 
when working from rescue disks but never when booted from that drive, or 
if /usr, /var, or /tmp are on it
