Now I remember that this was tried before and does
not work because SYNCLINK_HDLC is a bool and will
force the HDLC module to 'y' even if the synclink
driver is a 'm' which results in build errors.
I also tried 'depends on HDLC if SYNCLINK_HDLC'
in the config SYNCLINK section, but that causes a
cyclic dependency error. I suppose I could do that if I
remove 'depends on SYNCLINK' from config SYNCLINK_HDLC.
The only down side of that is the way the
SYNCLINK_HDLC option would be displayed.
I'll review this again to find the best solution.
