Hi all,
I have a problem regarding inserting a module.
 
I have the driver rpm with me in which I insert the module & accomplish other requirements of my driver.
When I say 
rpm -ivh tifm-1.3-1.i586.rpm
 
This is working fine on my system i.e on Suse 9.1 ( 2.6.5-7.71 kernel).
 
But, the client has a problem even when he works on a system with the same configuration 
i.e. Suse 9.1 ( 2.6.5-7.71 kernel)
 
He got the following error message :-
 
Error inserting tifm  (/lib/modules/2.6.5-7.71-default/kernel/drivers/block/tifm.ko): Invalid argument.
 
His system hangs after then.
What might be the reason behind it.
 
Regards,
Seenu.
