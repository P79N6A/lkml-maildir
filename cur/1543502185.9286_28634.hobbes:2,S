1. Because the user, for one reason or another, has to use
   the command line occasionally.  These users will be even
   more confused when the command line presents a different
   filesystem to the GUI.
2. Because GUI apps often invoke command line apps to do the
   work.  If the GUI thinks there's a file somewhere, it will
   expect the command line app it invokes to find the same thing.
3. Because users who prefer the command line want the same
   features with the same ease of use, just no GUI.
BTW I'm arguing here that the GUI and command line should have
consistent views.  Nothing to do with the kernel per se.
