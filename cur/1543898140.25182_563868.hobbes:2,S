If you buy the program, then you become the copyright holder.
I assume you meant buying a license.  In this case, especially in the
case of off-the-shelf non-Free Software, the license likely grants you
permission to run the program, otherwise why would you pay for the
license anyway?

Whoever gave you the copy you lawfully obtained is already subject to
and/or able to offer a copyright license anyway.  If the copyright
holder wants to restrict your ability to run the software, whether
copyright covers this case or not is absolutely irrelevant.
And evidently some businesses have interests in restricting your
ability to run software, not only to be able to sell you multiple
licenses of non-Free Software, but also to turn Free Software into
non-Free Software.

How do you reason about binary-only software fulfilling the goal of
copyright?  How does it deliver its part of the copyright deal with
society if, even after it goes public domain, still nobody can create
derived works from it because the source code remains unavailable?
