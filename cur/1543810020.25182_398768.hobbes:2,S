My mistake, I'll check MAINTAINERS instead of the file comments next
time.

Could you elaborate on which module owner issue you're referring to?
struct relay_attribute encapsulates a struct attribute, and it's handled
the same way as the other attribute types (I modelled it after
struct bin_attribute), and I don't see any places that I missed.
When setting up the relay attribute, it's just a matter of:
	static struct relay_attribute dev_relay_attr = {
		.attr	= {
			.owner	= THIS_MODULE,
			...
		},
		...
	};
Let me know if I've missed anything.

Yes, that's where I was going with this, but I figured I'd give the
relayfs people a chance to object to it going away first.
If with this in sysfs and simple handling through debugfs people are
content with the relay interface for whatever need, then getting rid of
relayfs entirely is certainly the best option. We certainly don't need
more pointless virtual file systems.
I'll work up a patch set for doing this as per Cristoph's kernel/relay.c
suggestion. Thanks for the feedback.
