There was a mistake in Jared's previous post in this
thread. The vm_flags were already in hex, i.e. 0x1875
The settings were:
VM_READ
VM_EXEC
VM_MAYREAD
VM_MAYWRITE
VM_MAYEXEC
VM_DENYWRITE
VM_EXECUTABLE
A possible problem source is that VM_PFNMAP is not set. 
Thus when vm_normal_page is called there is no associated
struct page.
