Many thanks for your time in investigating this, even though the problem
turned out to not be in your driver.  It actually didn't take long for
you, Richard Henderson, and Jay Estabrook to zero in on the problem after
I reported it on 7/20, and I see that reverting core_pyxis.c has been
suggested as a temporary fix several times on Linux-Kernel since that time.
I should have been more careful with credit in responding to "DumbKid;"
all I did for the problem was report it, and verify a proposed solution.

I don't think that this is the permanent solution.  The PCI windows were
moved for a reason (probably having to due with larger memories or newer
Alpha architectures), so reverting "core_pyxis.c" can only be a temporary
fix.

Well, this is why I take the time to try patches (though not every patch)
on my Alpha, even though I have little time to do so.  It's part of the
burden those of us with more atypical systems have to assume, to insure
that our systems remain supported.  And in this case, such testing and
reporting paid off, though I'm puzzled like you as to why an "official"
patch hasn't appeared.  Perhaps folks are waiting for Alan Cox to return
from his travels.
