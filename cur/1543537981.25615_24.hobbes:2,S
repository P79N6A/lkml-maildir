AFIR, an older version of the patch actually reduced an algorithims
complexity.. That part was accepted into the mainline kernel.
As I understand it, Linuses goal is to provided a useful and mailtainable
system. He's has decided that he wants to make it useful for audio tasks
and he's willing to impliment rechedule hacks where there is no
alternative (i.e. no complexity reduction can be performed).
