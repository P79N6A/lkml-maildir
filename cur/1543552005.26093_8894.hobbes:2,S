This should already be dealt with in the Makefile -- if !CONFIG_AGP,
then the file that we've been talking about (agpsupport.c) isn't
compiled.
(So, yes, you can still customize a drm module for your specific
kernel.  But I'm arguing for the ability to build a generic drm module
that will determine agpgart presence at run time and use it if needed.)
