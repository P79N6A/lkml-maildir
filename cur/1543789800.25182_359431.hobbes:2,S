If it is a device it goes onto corresponding bus. Platform bus is a
kind of a kitchen sink for things that do not have a "real" bus -
things like keyboard controller, older ISA devices, etc. Only things
that necessary to get the box going and have to be suspended last with
interrupts off (like IRQ controller) should be implemented as system
devices.
