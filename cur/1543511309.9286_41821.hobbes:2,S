Recently I copied the contents of my old HDD (320MB) to my new HDD
(12.6GB), using find / | cpio -pvd. Ever since, I can't allocate a pty. I
checked the access rights on /dev/pty*, and they were wrong (owner: root,
group: tty, access: crw-------). I then changed all access rights to:
crw-rw-rw-. Now I get ONE pty (ptya0), but no more (screen gets this one,
rxvt still gets none (screen closed)).
Also w always segfaults.
Everyting worked just fine on my old HDD, and for the rest everything runs
fine.
I'm running Redhat 6.0, the system is a i486 (Cyrix).
I'm running linux 2.2.10 stock. (this same kernel worked just fine before)
[chipzz@chipzz chipzz]$ ls -li /dev/pty* | head -2
   6568 crw-rw-rw-   1 root     tty        2, 176 Aug 25 17:41 /dev/ptya0
   6569 crw-rw-rw-   1 root     tty        2, 177 Aug 25 17:41 /dev/ptya1
Hardware problem is an option (I've seen strange things like floppy not
working any more), but I don't think this is the case here since I don't
have any file system corruption or anything else. But maybe some lib got
corrupted during copy.
Any help would be very much appreciated.
Thanx in advance,
Chipzz AKA
