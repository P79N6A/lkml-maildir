Have you tried it?

It will be called multiple times if *multiple* signals are pending,
and this is exactly the situation in your problem case (some other
signal is pending after the ptrace intercept SIGTRAP was delievered).

This is exactly what this patch is supposed to do: whenever during
a ptrace intercept the PSW is changed (as it presumably is by your
sigreturn implementation), regs->trap is automatically reset.
