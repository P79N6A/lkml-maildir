I used cdrecord (via xcdroast) to blank the CDRW and then burn UDF image created
by mkudffs.
Can I get this mount rainer udf extension work using just this method, and then
mount it?
Are there any specific mkudffs option that can help me? Or am I absolutely
obliged to use cdrwtool if I want to even think about using packet writing or
any other method to mount a CDRW?
