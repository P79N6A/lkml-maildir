Not much. schedule() has a small preempt window at the beginning
and end of the function.
The context switch is of course run with preempt disabled. Ie.
your switch_to should never get preempted.

Depends on your context switch, really. prev == current before you
switch, and when you switch to 'new' it is different. However, I think
the 'new' current has *its* old prev on the stack (which == new
current). You just have to preserve the old 'prev' somehow (ie. the
thread you switched away from).
