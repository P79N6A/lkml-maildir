Gee, exactly the names I use. Surely then, this is correct.
You even take the '.' off of .config like I do. The only
difference is that you don't keep a copy of vmlinuz as well.
For a Mac, the only difference is that you need vmlinuz and
there isn't any bzImage at all. Stuff still goes in /boot.
(plus ybin and yaboot.conf instead of lilo and lilo.conf)
