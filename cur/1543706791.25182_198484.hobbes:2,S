dma_supported() in particular shouldn't BUG(); this should work:
    if (use_dma && dma_supported(dev, ~(u32)0)) {
        ... set up for DMA ...
    } else {
        ... just use PIO instead ...
    }
Likewise the other routines that have clearly defined fault paths
should probably just use those instead of BUG().  Examples of this
type would be dma_alloc_coherent(), dma_map_sg() and maybe also
dma_get_cache_alignment().
Of course the API still lacks clean fault reporting for the single
shot mapping calls -- like maybe an arch-settable
   #define DMA_ADDR_INVALID (~(dma_addr_t)0)
return value -- but that'd be a different patch.
