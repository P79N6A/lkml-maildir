How small? The machines I am testing on aren't "big" but they aren't

That in itself is pretty incredible. From what I see, allocations up to 3 
generally work unless they are atomic even with the vanilla kernel. That 
said, it could be because slab is holding onto the high order pages for 
itself.

I'm not sure what you mean by per-order queues. The buddy allocator 
already has per-order lists.

One way to find out for sure.
