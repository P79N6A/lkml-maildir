Probably a cheap one, but I'm too tired to debug myself.
This is from a router with a DX486-33 running 2.0.37-ac8, libc5 system
with a NE2000 ethernet board and gated-3.5.7. Due to unfortunate
circumstances I had to shutdown the network (the system was once upon
a time RH-4.2 based, so there are still the necessary mechanisms) and
after that (so the eth0 if was already gone) the gated. Gated is using
OSPF and multicasting for its announces (this is IMHO important
because the crash occured in a kernel path which is related to
multicasting.

Looks to me that gated closes its multicast socket and the kernel
tries to remove a filter from a no longer existing network device.
Probably only a check missing.
