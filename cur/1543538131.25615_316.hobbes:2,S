Subject: 2.4.0-test3/pre2 breaks 3dfx.o

In vanilla 2.4.0-test1, 3Dfx's Device3Dfx Voodoo3 interface kernel module
(3dfx.o) worked fine.
I upgraded to -test3/pre2 and rebuilt the module, and this is what happens
when I try and access the 3dfx hardware:
cx863877-c# /usr/local/glide/bin/testGlide2x
test00:
Clear screen to blue
2.60.00.0415
Resolution: 640x480
Press A Key To Begin Test.
gd error (glide): Can't find or access Banshee/V3 board
gd error (glide): grSstSelect:  non-existent SST
zsh: segmentation fault /usr/local/glide/bin/testGlide2x
cx863877-c# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
3dfx                    5232  -1  (unused)
[..]
Notice odd negative usage counter.
At this point:
cx863877-c# modprobe -r 3dfx
3dfx: Device or resource busy
I've attached my .config at the end of this email.

also notice odd behaviour: bogomips scores for processors not identical
(probably unlrelated though).
the machine is set up as a netfilter/masq box, but I want to be able to
play some games on it too. As I stated before, it was working with the
pervious kernels and just recently stopped working, as soon as i upgraded
the kernel from test1; this is why I believe this to be a kernel issue and
not a 3dfx issue, although I will cc a copy of this message to them as
well.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
