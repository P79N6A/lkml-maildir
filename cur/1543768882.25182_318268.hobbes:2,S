About the time the SCSI subsystem driver is loaded the hard drive
activity light comes on and never goes out.  The drive is a Western
Digital, Vendor: ATA Model: WDC WD1200JD-00H  Rev: 08.0.
The motherboard is an ASUS P5DA2-E Deluxe (intel 925x chipset).
Western Digital and ASUS both recommended I check the jumper settings,
which I had done.  ASUS also sent me a CD containing updates for the
Windows drivers.  I don't use Windows, and presume the disk to be
irrelevant to solving the problem.
There appears to be no problems with data corruption; meaning if I copy
large files from sda1 to hda1 drives the files show no difference.
If I boot only to hda1 and not automount the SATA drive (/home, /usr)
things appear normal (no LED except when there is activity).
I saw some libata changes in the latest 31-pre2 so compiled and rebooted
with no difference in behavior.
Links to dmesg, .config, and lspci output at bottom.
Same behavior in the latest 2.6.11 kernel (same drivers back ported?)
I am not subscribed to the list but do follow it via USENET.
