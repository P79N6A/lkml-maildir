	Hi all, i just have probed egcs-1.1.2 with -march=pentium and it
seems it's all going well with 2.2.3...Normal
operations....sounds...networking with PPP....everything seems ok...i
would say that it is safe to use egcs-1.1.2 *BUT* i can't as i dont'n know
yet what is required to say that :).....Also consider that i just use what
a normal user has in his machine....the basics acording to hardware and
i'm just a client in networking i don't use isdn, nfs or things like
that....
	Greetings.....
