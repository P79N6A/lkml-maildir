that's the wrong way of doing a circular buffer..
It's better to allow the head and tail indices to wrap all the way through
0xffffffff and only mask them when they are actually used for subscripting.
That way:
add:
	array[head++ & (ATA_MAX_QUEUE-1)] = item;
remove:
	item = array[tail++ & (ATA_MAX_QUEUE-1)];
full:
	head - tail == ATA_MAX_QUEUE
empty:
	head == tail
number of items:
	head - tail
This requires that the array size be a power of two.
