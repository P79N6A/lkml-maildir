hm, i think you are right.
most latency reduction was concentrated on the PREEMPT+PREEMPT_BKL case, 
and not getting proper cond_resched() behavior in case of !PREEMPT_BKL 
would certainly not be noticed by distros or users.
We made CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y the default on SMP in v2.6.8, in this 
post-2.6.7 commit that introduced the feature:

|     [PATCH] remove the BKL by turning it into a semaphore
There was constant trouble around all these variations of preemptability 
and their combination with debugging helpers. (So i was rather happy to 
get rid of !PREEMPT_BKL - in the (apparently wrong) assumption that no 
tears will be shed.)
