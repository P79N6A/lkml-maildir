Hello,
i'm testing the latest devel version 2.3.49
It works fine, even if I force the nmi_watchdog to 0 in order to boot my SMP
system. With 2.2.x kernel this didn't happen.
But now I have another problem, or better another doubt... how can I use the
trident sound driver ? If I try a cat of /dev/sndstat I have an error, and if I
start xmms I have no sound.
Should I create some special devices? Or the default devices are ok?
thanks in advance,
Fausto
