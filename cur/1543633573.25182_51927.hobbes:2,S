You remove CPU 2 of 4 and the others renumber?  Everyone using per-cpu
buffers needs to write code to move them.  And what do apps bound to
CPU 3 do?  What about *their* per-cpu data structures?

And a greater requirement for everyone using per-cpu buffers (which
are becoming more common, not less) to write more code.  And it
doesn't deal with CPU removal.

Sorry, you're arguing to maintain a traditionally problematic
interface for an unmeasurable time benifit, and a slight space benefit
(on SMP machines, where noone has cared space about until recently).
Now, you *could* only allocate buffers for cpus where cpu_possible(i)
is true, once the rest of the patch goes in.  That would be a valid
optimization.
Rusty.
