Well, your above quote seems to "allow" the 2.0 behaviour. 
When you've got an established connection, you KNOW it is a temporary
error: you reached the host during connection setup just fine.  This
implies that you can safely guess that it is a permanent error when
you get it on the connection setup. 
The people who get a "host is unreachable try again later, if the
problems persist, contact the systems administrator" window, are
invited to try again later. Two seconds later should work.
Even if RFCs recommend the 2.2 behaviour, I'd personally like an
option to be non-RFC compliant. We already have those (always-defrag
comes to mind). 
Regards,
