At first glance, this is the sticky point that jumps out at me.

I take it, from what Andy writes, and from my other experience with
similar customers, that his workload is not "well-behaved" in the
sense you hoped for.
After several diverse jobs are run, we cannot, so far as I know,
merge small pages back to big pages.
I have not played with Mel Gorman's Fragmentation Avoidance patches,
so don't know if they would provide a substantial improvement here.
They well might.
