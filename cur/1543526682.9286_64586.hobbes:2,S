Subject: 2.3.47-7 binary support messed up?

With 2.3.47-7, when I run a script that has 
#!/usr/bin/perl
at the top of it, it runs fine. However, when the line looks like:
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
or contains anything else after the regular interpreter, a
message appears like: 
bash: ./runme.pl: No such file or directory
This does not just happen with a perl app. If I have a shell script, and i
add a parameter after #!/bin/sh, i get the same message. 
I am using gcc 2.95.2, ELF, a.out, and MISC binary support compiled into
the kernel, running 128 MB RAM, and an AMD K6-2 450.
