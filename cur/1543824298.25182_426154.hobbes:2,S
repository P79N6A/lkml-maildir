I can't remember ever saying that. I said that sending anything with the 
NMI bit set will end up at the NMI vector, not the original vector
you specified. Or at least that is what the Intel manual specify.
That is why it is useless to hook the original vector like you did
and add special cases just to get an NMI send with different vector.
