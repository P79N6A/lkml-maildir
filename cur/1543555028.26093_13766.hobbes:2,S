Subject: reordering pci interrupts?

I have a motherboard with a broken bios that is unable to set interrupts
correctly, i.e. it initializes the devices corerctly but swaps the
interrupts for slot1/slot3 and slot2/slot4.
Now, is there a way to forcefully re-order the pci-interrupts? I do not
have an io-apic (thus no pirq=xxx), and I tried to poke the interrupt
values directly into /proc/bus/pic/*/*, but the kernel has it's own idea.
Thanks a lot for any info (I guess I'll just patch the kernel).
