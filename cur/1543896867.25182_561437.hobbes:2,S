No, there is no reason to wait for a fair scheduler at all. A *desktop* distro
*must* take process priorities into account, otherwise it's broken by design.
If you don't know where in your distro you can say "more CPU for the video"
and "less CPU for the encoder", then ask your vendor. It's something so much
basic and obvious that I cannot imagine not being supported. Even my mp3 player
script has been setting its prio for the last 8 years in order to avoid skips!

Yes, it should.
