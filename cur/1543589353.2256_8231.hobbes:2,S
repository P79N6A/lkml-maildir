Here is my ext2 directory index as a patch against your patch:
    
http://kernelnewbies.org/~phillips/htree/dx.pcache-2.4.4
Changes:
    - COMBSORT macro replaced by custom sort code
    - Most #ifdef CONFIG_EXT2_INDEX's changed to if (<constant>)
To do:
  - Split up the split code
  - Finalize hash function
  - Test/debug big endian
  - Fall back to linear search if bad index detected
  - Fail gracefully on random data
  - Remove the tracing and test options
To apply:
    cd source/tree
    zcat ext2-dir-patch-S4.gz | patch -p1
    cat dx.pcache-2.4.4 | patch -p0
To create an indexed directory:
    mount /dev/hdxxx /test -o index
    mkdir /test/foo
