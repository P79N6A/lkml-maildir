Thanks Nathan,
I've changed things as suggested ...
Now, it does not even have the lines 
SCSI device sda: 128000 512-byte hdwr sectors (66 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
Let alone viewing the partitions.
You have :
hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/2, assigned device number 3
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
Vendor: FUJIFILM  Model: USB-DRIVEUNIT     Rev: 1.00
Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
As the total output.
It appears the original "USB-DRIVEUNIT" code in 2.4.2-2 was OK, or there's
some external problem in indentifying the sda device characteristics.
