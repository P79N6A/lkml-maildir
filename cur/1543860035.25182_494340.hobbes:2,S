This is complete nonsense. The car manufacturer can very well agree with
you to sell you the right to only drive the car on weekdays, and rent it
off on weekends. Nothing forces them to sell "all rights they have on the
car".

Ask a lawyer about this, don't impose your wacky legal theories on us.

Define "reasonable way". The manufacturer could very well define it as "use
the XYZ graphics card on Windows XP service pack 2", as it was designed
specifically for that environment. Everything else (use on Linux, for
example) is then "unreasonable use", and need not be supported at all.
