same for me. I tried the two module parameters and the kernel parameter:
pci=nomsi sky2.disable_msi=1 sky2.idle_timeout=1000

I had a dedicated server with sky2 which had the same symptoms but I
disabled the onboard sky2 to and added a e100. On my mac mini I can
reproduce it nearly immediately. Just have to scp a kernel tar tree over
and it hangs.

For me it works pretty good.
