Hi,
I'm playing the pcmcia of 2.5.47 on my new machine. And, I got the
Oops after yenta_socket.o was unloaded. It seems pci_unregister_driver()
doesn't call pci_driver->remove().  So, pcmcia driver couldn't release
the resouce.
This reproduce it,
    # modprobe yenta_socket
    # modprobe -r yenta_socket
    ... happen the interrupt, because it was shared irq
    Oops
I think driver-model(?) expects using dev->release(), in this
case. Corrent?  And, How should it fix?
Regards
