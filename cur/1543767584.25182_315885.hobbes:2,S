/usr/bin/env is used in scripts in the shebang line (the very first line
of the script, starting with "#!", which denotes the interpreter to use
for that script) to make a PATH search for the real interpreter.
Some folks keep their python (or Perl, or Bash etc.) in /usr/local/bin
or in $HOME, that's why this construct is needed at all.
Changing environment variables is not the goal, insofar this usage
exploits only a side-effect of env.  It is portable in practice because
env is in /usr/bin on most modern systems.
So you could replace this first line of a bash script:
   #!/usr/bin/env python
with this:
   #!python
except that the latter doesn't work because you need to specify an
absolute path there. :]
