"ld" usually wants a .start symbol (or something...) - and it looks like
nasm does not put some into the object file.

Well, I did the same with GCC (GNU AS):
.intel_syntax noprefix;
.section .rodata;
.L_LC0:
	.string "och bin";
.text;
	pusha;
	mov eax, 4;
	mov ebx, 1;
	mov ecx, offset flat:.L_LC0;
	mov edx, 8;
	int 0x80;
18:43 eax:../hxtools/examples # cc x.S -c
18:43 eax:../hxtools/examples # ld x.o -o x.aout
ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000008048074
18:43 eax:../hxtools/examples # ./x.aout 
och binSegmentation fault
- The segfault is due to the abrupt end after int 0x80,
  so let's not consider it.
- "och bin" is printed
- As you can see, there is said _start symbol which I presume NASM
  fails to generate.
