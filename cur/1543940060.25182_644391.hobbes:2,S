Actually it would probably -- i guess it's undefined and in undefined
country such things can happen.
Also to be fair I think it's only a problem for the 4GB wrapping case
which is presumably rare (otherwise we would have heard about it)
Also worse really fixing it would be a major change to the VFS 
because of the way ->read/write are defined :/
