well I like devfs, in the sense that it is really easy to see what you can 
use in /dev. Before i used devfs it could be quite difficult since there were 
so much nodes and symlinks in /dev and many have cryptic names... and 
sometimes the entries i needed simply were not there so i had to find the 
right major/minor numbers to create them...
from a user point of view it is better to keep it because it could really 
simplify a users life except ide should be just in discs as hdX and not as 
/dev/ide/hostN/busX/targetY/lunZ/disc ...

if the code is really that horrible, then maybe that is the best solution but 
again i like the concept.
