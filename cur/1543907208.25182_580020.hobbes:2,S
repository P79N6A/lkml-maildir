Andrew, may I inquire about your plans with this?

This one interests me most, due to various real life, reported
problems with fuse filesystems.  For this reason I'd really like to
get this or a subset of it into mainline as soon as possible.
This patchset (or rather the -v7 version) has been running on my
laptop for a couple of weeks without problems.  I've also verified
that it solves the fuse and loop issues.
I have some qualms about the complexity of various parts though.
Especially the "proportions" library, which I'm having problems
understanding.  I'm not sure that this level of sophistication is
really needed to solve the issues with the old code.
