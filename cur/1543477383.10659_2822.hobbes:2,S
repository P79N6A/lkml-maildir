AFAIK, Canada doesn't have export restrictions on strong open source
crypto so that shouldn't be a problem.
If the US have relaxed its restrictions then I guess patches from the
US except for implementations of the actual ciphers (>56bit) are ok.
However, I haven't seen this policy change discussed much so I don't
know what the realities are.
