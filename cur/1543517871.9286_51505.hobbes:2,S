Do other parts of the kernel have CVS trees that actually work well? I
know ISDN does, but Linus has expressed his displeasure of how that group
feeds him patches, he wants small patches that do simple things most of
the time. I know ISDN has tried to feed large ones from their CVS tree,
only to be rejected.
IRDA used to have a CVS tree, but now that it is integrated into the
kernel, I don't know.
With the exception of the large change that the URBs will have, most of
the time it has been small patches that have been submitted. Even the HID
patch was not very large. I don't know if CVS is the answer for this. As
long as the maintainer(s) feed these to Linus for inclusion in the main
kernel trunk, any CVS tree should not be very different from the kernel
source. So the advantage of having a CVS tree is reduced.
And what about Bitkeeper and how it is going to affect submitting patches?
But if CVS is really wanted, I second the recommendation of using
sourceforge.net. They seem to have a huge amount of bandwidth and
processing power. Much more than I could ever offer up.
