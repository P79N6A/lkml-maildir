It shouldn't be a problem. These days we have a lot of arch hooks
in the PCI layer. I'd probably start with the following:
static void __init
pcibios_enable_p2p_vga_fwd(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
	u16 class = dev->class >> 8;
	struct pci_bus *b;
	if (class == PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_VGA ||
	    class == PCI_CLASS_NOT_DEFINED_VGA) {
		for (b = dev->bus; b->parent; b = b->parent) {
			b->bridge_ctl |= PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA;
		}
	}
}
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, pcibios_enable_p2p_vga_fwd);

It was quite a few years ago, so I don't recall all details...
I think some old alphas cannot cope with VGA behind the p2p bridges.
But I also recall that this code was problematic on alpha with multiple
VGA cards.
Note that setup-bus code in 2.4 does more reasonable thing - it
enables VGA port forwarding *only* for the first (by PCI enumeration)
VGA device, and doesn't enable this for others (if any). Unlike 2.6 :-(
