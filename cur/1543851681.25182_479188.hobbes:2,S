Did you try this option?  It may decrease performance, but in some cases
IRQ routing is so screwed that only irqpoll helps.

The "nobody cared" error is often caused by some other device which
shares the same interrupt, but Linux does not know about it (either due
to broken IRQ routing tables in BIOS, or because the driver for that
device is not loaded, but the device really is active and asserts its
IRQ line - sometimes this also happens due to a broken BIOS).
Please post complete /proc/interrupts and lspci -v output, and also
information about the motherboard model and BIOS version.
If your motherboard has a VIA chipset, you may also try the patch from
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/7/235
 which attempts to fix IRQ routing on
these chipsets.
