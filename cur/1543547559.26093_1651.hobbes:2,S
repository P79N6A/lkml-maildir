Andre, as far as I can tell, this "complex point" is just the kind of 
queueing that SCSI has done all along.  sure, if you want to juggle
multiple outstanding commands, you need a structure to track them.
what continues to mystify me is why you believe that it's appropriate 
for the driver to prevent any op it doesn't understand.  yes, it needs
to track the tags of queued commands, including those via ide_ioctl.
but ensuring tag sanity is very different from filtering.
regards, mark hahn.
