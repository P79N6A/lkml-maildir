Aha good. I will check it later.

Good one.

system_restart for rebooting */
Aha as for the cobalt stuff?

I had those there too but I eliminated them. I used following methods:
For the status stuff I did a variable boot_status and status. I have
a handler for this in the common IOCTL handling code.
I have no such thing for the temp IOCTL but the new "ioctl" operation
could be created to catch it.
(and get called when no standard ioctl in watchdog-dev is used)
As for sysfs, I would like to have the temps handled with the hwmon class
and have some sort of "symlink" from the watchdog directory to corresponding
hwmon directory. The status stuff might be handled via standard format sysfs file.

got the unsigned long to have more space...

I dont have the state machine but something like this is implemented in the dev
device handling.
Additionaly I have the self ping stuff in the class too.

In the w83792d I used different approach, because the device is not only a
watchog, the struct watchdog_device was a part of the common device structure,
and for single purpose devices this *private makes sense. But I think there
some per device private data pointer somewhere.

Alan already did a hint about the device driver callback that may handle this.
Now it seems we have two different approaches and a code, so which one will wim
? ;) If you want to talk to me you may find me on #linux-sensors on freenode.net.
Also I would like to know your ideas about the sysfs file structure for
watchdogs and also If you like to have more watchdogs active in the system or
just one.
Thanks,
Regards
Rudolf
