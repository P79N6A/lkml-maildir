Hi, using an ATAPI cdrom drive to rip audio tracks.
syslogd is configured to send *.emerg to all consoles.
When I rip audio tracks, my kernel logs and screen get spammed
with:
Mar 24 23:15:18 sulamore kernel: hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 {
DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Mar 24 23:15:18 sulamore kernel: hdc: packet command error: error=0xb0
Mar 24 23:15:18 sulamore kernel: ATAPI device hdc:
Mar 24 23:15:18 sulamore kernel:   Error: Aborted command -- (Sense
key=0x0b)
Mar 24 23:15:18 sulamore kernel:   Loss of streaming -- (asc=0xbf,
ascq=0x00)
Mar 24 23:15:18 sulamore kernel:   The failed "<NULL>" packet command was: 
Mar 24 23:15:18 sulamore kernel:   "be 04 00 03 57 4a 00 00 08 f8 00 00 "
Is there a reason this message is given the status of emergency? It's
really annoying, and my machine doesn't seem to be suffering from a great
emergency...I'm guessing I just have a crap CD drive.
Is there any way to filter these things out?
Thanks,
Chris
