I think the Xen guys would disagree with you on this.  Xen claims <3% 
overhead on the XenSource site.
Where did you get these figures from?  What Xen version did you test? 
What was your configuration? Did you have kernel debugging enabled? You 
can't just post numbers without the data to back it up, especially when 
it conflicts greatly with the Xen developers statements.  AFAIK Xen is 
well on it's way to inclusion into the mainstream kernel.
Thank you,
