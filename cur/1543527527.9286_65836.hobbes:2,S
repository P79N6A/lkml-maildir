Anyone directly exposing databases of credit information on their internet
machines deserves a negligence suit. 
A proper setup looks like this
--[firewall]---[Web box] -serialline- [backend]
The serial line takes a fixed command set to a verified small code daemon on
the backend side. It has commands for 'store credit details' it has NO
command for 'retrieve credit card number'. You don't need that functionality
on the front end boxes.
