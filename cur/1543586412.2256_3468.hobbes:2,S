Even if the bug is a compile error?
E.g.
BUG REPORT (a real one, I didn't have the time yet to post a patch):
kernel versions: tested with 2.4.2-ac24, afaics 2.4.3 is also affected
Description:
Several config options are missing in the 'if' at the end of
linux/drivers/net/pcmcia/Config.in.
This means that CONFIG_PCMCIA_NETCARD is not set, and then (iirc) the
kernel won't link.
CONFIG_ARCNET_COM20020_CS
CONFIG_PCMCIA_HERMES
CONFIG_AIRONET4500_CS
CONFIG_PCMCIA_IBMTR
are missing.
Obviously too much data doesn't hurt, as long as
* it's hidden somewhere deep in a database, clearly separated from the
important parts (if there is an oops: decoded oops, description, how
easy is it to trigger the bug, steps to reproduce)
* very easy for the bug reporter to collect.
* not mandatory.
