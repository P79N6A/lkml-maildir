Matrox G200 AGP.
Usually I have XF86_SVGA sitting on tty12, although I spend the majority of
my time in virtual-console land.
I run a top-like app of my own creation on tty5 (updates the screen every
second with various stats), and irc on tty4, nothing really updates that
quickly.
The fifth crash (tonight), I never did get around to starting X, but I did
run a few invocations of fbset -accel false (BTW, is there a way to set fb
options for all consoles at once?) and then a few minutes after that it
tanked (probably while I was switching from an accelerated console to a
non-accelerated one).
I've changed my boot options to video=matrox:vesa:0x118,fastfont:40960,noaccel
and set acceleration on selected consoles (scrolling up a line, f.e. up-arrow
in less, is painful without it).
I'll have to see how that works.

Does IRC in a moderately-busy channel count? :)

Yes, on tty12, but not this time around.

I'll try this when I get some difinitive results (crash or stability) from
the fastfont/noaccel thing.

Yes, no.

More stuff to try after I find out whether it stops crashing. :)
I'll give the fbcon X server another whirl to see if it does anything too.
Thanks for your help!
