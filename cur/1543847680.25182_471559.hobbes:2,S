Subject: [PATCH] [PCI] Prevent user config space access during power state transitions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/10/146

Section 5.3 of PCI Bus Power Management 1.2 states:
  There is a minimum recovery time requirement of 200 Âµs between when
  a function is programmed from D2 to D0 and when the function can be
  next accessed as a target (including PCI configuration accesses). If
  an access is attempted in violation of the specified minimum recovery
  time, undefined system behavior may result.
We have to prevent the user running lspci during this time, and
fortunately we already have the pci_block_user_cfg_access() API to
do this.
