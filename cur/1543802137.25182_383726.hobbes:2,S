Subject: [PATCH] i386/x86-64: Removes 'enable_timer_pin_1' command-line option.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

 Hi,
 Commit 66759a01adbfe8828dd063e32cf5ed3f46696181 added two new command-line
options, IIUC:
 disable_timer_pin_1: used to disable PIN 1 of the APIC timer, only had
real effect on non-ATI chipsets, becuase the commit also added code to
disable the PIN automatically on ATI chipsets
 enable_timer_pin_1: used to enable PIN 1 of the APIC timer, only had
real effect on ATI chipsets, where the PIN was automatically disabled.
 But commit 1619cca2921f6927f4240e03f413d4165c7002fc removed the
automatic detection of ATI chipsets, so think "enable_timer_pin_1" is
useless now.
 This patch removes it, completing the work of the last commit.
