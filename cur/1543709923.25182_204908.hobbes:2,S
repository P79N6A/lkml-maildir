I suspect there's nothing wrong with that under many common scenarios 
(apart from the one thing I seem to dislike so much that if a cdrom 
isn't being used, no driver for it should be loaded). But it does impose 
certain amount of strict policy that Unix (and Linux more so) has long 
been doing a great job of avoiding.

Does the devfs/udev /dev entry get removed when doing rmmod? I though 
not. But since the module isn't there anymore, doing mount /dev/cdrom 
/cdrom would give "No such device". Not a problem per se, but then 
probably rmmod -a isn't as a wise thing to do with udev as it is with 
devfs. Bad.
