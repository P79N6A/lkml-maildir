The extra reference is on the iocb itself.  Each iocb has a reference
on the ioctx.  When dropping the extra reference using __aio_put_req(),
you have to check if it was the last reference and then drop that iocb's
reference on the ioctx by calling put_ioctx().  It is the ioctx's ref
count that is never zero here.
Having the extra ref on the iocb, guarantees that the iocb won't be
freed until the extra reference is dropped. In the initial submit
case, the lower level code has looking at the iocb after submitting
it (which was racy without the extra reference).  This patch just
added the extra reference for iocb during retries.
