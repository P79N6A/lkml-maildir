There are no flip buffers in 2.6.17, they've gone. The tty buffering is
now a proper queuing system.

Not in the current kernel tree. The current tree does this:
       spin_lock_irqsave(&tty->buf.lock, flags);
        head = tty->buf.head;
        if (head != NULL) {
                tty->buf.head = NULL;
                for (;;) {
                        int count = head->commit - head->read;
                        if (!count) {
                                if (head->next == NULL)
                                        break;
                                tbuf = head;
                                head = head->next;
                                tty_buffer_free(tty, tbuf);
                                continue;
                        }
                        if (!tty->receive_room) {
                                schedule_delayed_work(&tty->buf.work, 1);
                                break;
                        }
                        if (count > tty->receive_room)
                                count = tty->receive_room;
                        char_buf = head->char_buf_ptr + head->read;
                        flag_buf = head->flag_buf_ptr + head->read;
                        head->read += count;
                        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tty->buf.lock, flags);
                        disc->receive_buf(tty, char_buf, flag_buf, count);
                        spin_lock_irqsave(&tty->buf.lock, flags);
                }
                tty->buf.head = head;
        }
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tty->buf.lock, flags);
