The patch appears to work but is it worth applying now?  The existing
2.4 rules work fine and the entire kbuild system will be rewritten for
2.5, including the case you identified here.  It struck me as a decent
change but for no benefit and, given that the 2.4 kbuild system is so
fragile, why not live with something we know works until 2.5 is
available?
