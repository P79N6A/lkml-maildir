Hi Trond,
I have found a working combination of GCC/Binutils [gcc-3.4.3,
binutils-2.16.1 (GCC needs more work as it got its specs wrong and has a
bug in it regarding %llu on sparc).
This suggests that there is a kernel build error associated with GCC-4.0.2
(for sparc-linux). I will need to investigate this as GCC-4.0.2 has a
veriety of bug fixes in it that affect the sparc-linux target. It also has
improved configuration/build scripts that are relevent to what I am trying
to do.
I will let you know what I find. It may take me some time as my sparc
assembly is not too good and this is the best place to find compiler
hickups.
Regards
	Mark Fortescue.
