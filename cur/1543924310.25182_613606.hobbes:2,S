This is needed for management firmware to work properly.  Management
firmware expects any VLAN tags to be stripped.  Unfortunately, VLAN
stripping cannot be done independently between the driver and the
firmware.  The workaround is to disable management firmware.

Most of these on-board devices are shipped with management firmware
enabled.  Removing the check will make the firmware not functional.
We realize this VLAN limitation is causing problems to many users and we
are looking for ways to address it.
