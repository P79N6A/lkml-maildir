Subject: [PATCH 4/5] driver core: export device_rename
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>
In wireless we'd like to allow renaming of the phy devices we surface in
sysfs. The base wireless code, however, can be built modular and thus we
need device_rename exported.
