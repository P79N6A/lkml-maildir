I don't propose reverting the IRQ re-name patch and breaking the
big iron without replacing it with something else that works.
My point is that the re-name patch has added unnecessary maintenance
complexity to the 99.9% of systems that it runs on.  We pay that price
in several ways, including mis-understandings about what devices
are on what irqs, and mis-understandings about how the code is
supposed to work.
