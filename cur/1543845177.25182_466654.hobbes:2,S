These are the playback and capture sample rates used by the hardware.
The rate is that of the file last played (or currently being played).

The AC'97 specification says that the AC'97 bus runs at 48 kHz.
However, there is some hardware that doesn't use this frequency, so
the driver tries to measure the actual rate.

It seems that, when compiled in the kernel, some other code runs at
the same time as the clock measuring code and interferes with it,
probably by disabling interrupts for too long.

This option is intended to specify a value different from the
default.  Try 47999.  ;-)
