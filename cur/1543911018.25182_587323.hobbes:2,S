That patch is no longer in 2.6.23-rc3-mm1, my bootlog says:
[    0.000000] Unknown boot option `sata_nv.swncq=1': ignoring
I could not find this patch in any git trees I looked and its removal
mail from mm-commit said:
"This patch was dropped because Changes in Jeff's tree destroyed it."
I only found out about the swncq=1 command line option yesterday and
so tested it only one day.
But I did not have any trouble with it, even as my drive was made by Maxtor.
The chipset:
00:05.0 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP55 SATA Controller (rev a3)
00:05.1 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP55 SATA Controller (rev a3)
00:05.2 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP55 SATA Controller (rev a3)
The drive:
Device Model:     MAXTOR STM3320820AS
Serial Number:    5QF2E698
Firmware Version: 3.AAE
As it worked for me, I hope that patch will be picked up by someone. :)
