Mister Chehab, for the first and for the utmost last time now:
My deselection patch implies a very good text to strongly discourage the use of DST
and DST_CA in case someone does not know what he or she is doing. In so far the case that "cards with ST chips (DST and/ or DST CA) will stop working" will not happen at all.
This patch IS NOT DONE TO MAKE ANY DST OR DST_CA MODULE REQUIRING CARD WORK - 
THIS IS YOUR PART OF SO-CALLED LOGIC!!!!
THIS PATCH IS DONE TO AVOID RAM WASTE FOR CASES IN WHICH IT IS PROVEN THAT DST AND DST_CA ARE NOT NEEDED AT ALL!!!!
Example: Pinnacle PCTV SAT!!!
And once again and for the last time:
I did not manage to at least find one single unresolved module during compilation, and I have been working with this almost fantastic solution with several kernels for months now!
Above that I gave you every proof one can ever give: You received dmesg, you received configs, you received proven thesis, you received everything.
It would really be a perfect solution to bomb away the almost incredible meters thick wall in front of your head and your eyes.
And at this time I will stop responding to your mails - I got enough of you!!!
It's enough!!

Happy reflection, Mister Chehab!!!!!
