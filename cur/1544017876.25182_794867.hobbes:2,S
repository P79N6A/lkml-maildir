Hi Eric,
funny or sad thing is that this happens while mounting only one of partitions
(/home) which is:
$ df -h | grep /home
/dev/sda5              20G   14G  6,0G  69% /home
This bug is quite strange, as I mentioned, first boot on new kernel went OK,
next two resulted in such behavior. Now I'm running 2.6.29-rc2-12097-gf3b8436
and no bug here. Nevertheless I'm not fully happy, as it was seen before, the
bug might still happen (will boot few times to test it and report back to you).
First yesterday buggy but went unnoticed so I've started fluxbox and firefox
(errors seen in log), as usual, then found that sth is wrong. Second boot was
also buggy than I've returned to old kernel where everything was OK ... nearly
everything, cause firefox suddenly ,,forgot'' all configuration.
I will boot my notebook on all those 2.6.29-* kernel few times and maybe be able
to reproduce that bug.
