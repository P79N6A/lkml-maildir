The "good folks at RedHat" have nothing to do with iBCS or x286emul.
The x286emul that originally came with iBCS was a proof of concept
by yours truely. It has since been fixed and enhanced by David
Bruce <admin@hulcote.com> and the version available from somewhere
on his web site is often newer than the version that comes with iBCS
(although I try to upgrade it occasionally).
