seems broken to me.  if follow_dotdot() changes nd->dentry (can happen!),
inode needs to be changed.  look:
        inode = nd->dentry->d_inode;
        for(;;) {
                err = exec_permission_lite(inode);
                if (this.name[0] == '.') switch (this.len) {
                        case 2: 
                                if (this.name[1] != '.')
                                        break;
                                follow_dotdot(&nd->mnt, &nd->dentry);
                                inode = nd->dentry->d_inode;
                                /* fallthrough */
                        case 1:
                                continue;
                }
        }
btw, you should cc linux-fsdevel for patches to the VFS.
