Do you have ACPI enabled?
If so, you may need to disable it - its power-off method will override the 
APM-provided power-off routine, and even if the ACPI power-off routine fails 
to work, it won't fall back to the APM one. 
I posted a patch a few days ago which fixed this by keeping a list of possible 
power-off functions, to be attempted in turn until one of them actually works.
