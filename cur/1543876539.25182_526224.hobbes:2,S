Is it OK to do that? I recall when I was originally looking at the code
I didn't want to just remove that line, because it looked like that was
being used to first initialise the vc* structure when it is created, as
well as reset it every time. Doesn't this leave vc->vc_utf uninitialised
when a new VC is allocated?
