Using normal memory accesses is wrong though, it'll break miserably on
systems where the PCI memory is not mapped as regular memory in on
contigous chunk. Some of the early Alpha's have what they call sparse
memory.
This is one of the reasons why the __raw_{read,write} macros were
introduced - you should use them in this case to make the code
portable.
