Sort of, you can currently confuse the elf loader with multiple bss segments.
The stack, and the brk pointer are still used.

This is a reflection of what areas of memory the kernel sees.  In principle
every thing is now handled by mmap, and this /proc/maps is a reflection
of that.  See under the files in mm/*.c
