No problems. I've been quite busy also.

Exactly, but I didn't manage to get the 2x512MB modules useable in my
machine. In fact, sometimes the machine wouldn't even POST with the two
modules, but as soon as I removed any one of them, the machine was back
to normal.

Right now, I am using 512 + 256 running at PC100 speeds, with latencies
all set to 3-3-3. Now, it seems to run stably, but is slower than what I
would like it to run, of course.
I will still keep trying some combinations, but some of them seem
definitely ruled out (like having both 512 MB modules at the same time).
Thank you very much for your comments, Rogério Brito.
