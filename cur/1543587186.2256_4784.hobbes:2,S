Hello!

If my guess is right, you can easily put this socket to funny state
just catting a large file and kill -STOP'ing ssh. ssh will close window,
but sshd will not send zero probes. Any socket with keepalives enabled
enters this state after the first keepalive is sent.
[ Note, that it is not Butenko's problem, it is still to be discovered. 8) ]
I think you will not able to reproduce full problem: socket will revive
after the first received ACK. It is another bug and its probability is
astronomically low.
