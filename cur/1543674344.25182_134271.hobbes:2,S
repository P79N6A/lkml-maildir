On paper it sounds good but it may be more difficult (and not perfect) in 
practice.  For example, if you have one runnable task per cpu, moving it to 
another cpu would not help.  To preserve fairness, all you could do is swap 
the tasks around, which would thrash the cache pretty well.  Also, the int 
load may be very dynamic, so you need to be really careful and make sure you 
are measuring sustained int load.  
However I do agree, we need something in the scheduler, in particular 
something to modify max_load and load in find_busiest_queue, based on a int 
load average for those cpus.
