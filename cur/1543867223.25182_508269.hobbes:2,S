Well on the system on a board we were trying, using the development
baseboard from the same supplier, by simply doing a ping flood through
the onboard rtl8139 I managed to get corrupted ethernet packets fairly
frequently.  The WAN cards (T1/E1) we were trying to make work with it
were much more upset by it.  It could be bad enough corruption to cause
the chip on the card and the driver to get out of sync and just have no
idea what to do anymore.  Given our mainboard works perfectly fine using
a Geode SC1200 instead of the PXA255 board, I can only figure the PCI
bus wasn't implemented correctly on that chip, unless PCI on arm is done
wrong in linux (I sure hope not).  There doesn't seem to be very many
arm systems with PCI, so it's hard to tell.  Now other than PCI the
system was wonderful.  Fast, reliable, ran great even at high
temperatures, etc.  Just couldn't get the stupid PCI bus to work.
