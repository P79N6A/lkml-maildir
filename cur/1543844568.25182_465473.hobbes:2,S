I just reverted Randy's printk format 'fix', since rq->flags _is_ an
unsigned long, so changing from %ld to %d actually _introduces_ a
warning.
Randy, that's the second time I recall recently that I've ended up
reverting a printk format fix from you -- what are you doing? How did
you manage to get the warning you reported:
drivers/mtd/mtd_blkdevs.c:72: warning: long int format, different type arg (arg 2)
