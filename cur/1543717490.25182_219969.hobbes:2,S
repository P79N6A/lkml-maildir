Well, I believe that the inodes that are marked as memory_backed are
for the ramdisk, and that isn't really a problem.  The block device
that I am writing to is a compact flash, so it's going through the ide-disk
device.  I do not see this inode show up on any superblock's dirty queue
(since it doesn't appear that mark_inode_dirty() is being called for
it).  So the question I am asking is, what strategy is *supposed* to be
in place to flush the blocks out?  (Or is this a hole that isn't plugged?)
