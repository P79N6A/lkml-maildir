And I think that is a GOOD design point, no question. One of our next
steps is/was to relax the global decision making process that we pursued
to be able to compare A's with A's. Occasionally doing this every Nth time
might be something useful.

I think that would be a problem. My understanding is that if two RT process
are globally runnable, then one must run the one with higher priority.
Am I missing something here ?

That seems appropriate ... looking forward to see that.
