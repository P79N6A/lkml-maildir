hmm, well, probably the result of a halfhearted attempt
to satisfy both, the OpenStep and the MacOS Classic
developers ... but that doesn't belong here ...
just as fact:

# man gcc
      file.s
           Assembler code.  Apple's version of GCC runs the preprocessor on
           these files as well as those ending in .S.
      file.S
           Assembler code which must be preprocessed.
# uname -a

ONTOPIC:
why not move the intermediate files into a separate
subdirectory which can easily be removed on cleanup?
of course, gcc could also be changed to use different
extensions than .s and .S for those files ...
best,
