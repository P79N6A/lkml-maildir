Subject: problem with ide dvd-rom in 2.6.0 test

I consistently get errors reading dvd-r disks under 2.6.0 test on
hardware that performs fine under 2.4.x.
Specs are Dell Pentium 4 desktop machine running Debian unstable with a
Samsung DVD/CDRW ide drive.
The errors are reported as follows:
Oct 28 13:26:31 car kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Oct 28 13:26:31 car kernel: hdc: rw=0, want=8320756, limit=8308032
The kernel recognizes the drive as follows:
hdc: attached ide-scsi driver.
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  Vendor: SAMSUNG   Model: CDRW/DVD SM-332B  Rev: T408
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
The problem occurs consistently whether I mount the drive using the
ide-scsi driver or as a plain ide disk.  It occurs with every 2.6.0 test
kernel I've tried (test2 and on).
It sounds similar to a problem reported by Jakub Bogusz with 2.6.0 test3
in August:

Any ideas?  Any more information I can provide or anything I should try
to narrow it down?
Thanks.
