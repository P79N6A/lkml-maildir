I get a reject from this because it is dependent upon later patches.  As
the Official Protector Of Page Flags, I'm going to drop it.
Did you investigate
static inline int page_tail(struct page *page)
{
	return ((page->flags & (PG_compound|PG_tail)) == (PG_compound|PG_tail));
}
and
static inline int page_tail(struct page *page)
{
	return unlikely(PageCompound(page)) && unlikely(PageTail(page));
}
?
In the latter case we _should_ have a not-taken branch to not-inline code. 
If the compiler doesn't do that, we can make the PageTail() test an
out-of-line function.  Or make the whole thing an uninlined function.
More work needed, please.  I don't expect that a not-taken branch to
not-inline code is worth a new page flag.  Especially as it does not
actually reduce the number of branch decisions in the common case.
(I'm assuming in all of this that !PageCompound() is the very common case
with slub.  If that is not true, we need to talk).
