I'm not sure it's worse than the XML like format proposals that seem to
get thrown around. That is I am the only one who mentioned the
X word yet, but the structured ASCII records that have been hinted
at would be exactly like that.

Actually I think now MCE threshold interrupts should have never been
separate events. That was a design mistake in the AMD implementation
(together with all the sysfs complications)
An MCE threshold interrupt is just a slightly different internal
notification mechanism and it should only trigger the events it reads
from the MCE banks. Nothing more.
My upcoming CMCI code works exactly this way.

Yes we need some mechanism for those. Fortunately that's easier
because it doesn't need to handle NMIs.

Now that's a different issue. Generalized driver error reporting for everyone.
There was a lot of discussion some years ago from a IBM proposal to do
in general structured error reporting. But that was quite unpopular
and no-one really liked it.
What came out of it was the dev_printk() stuff that allows
to match error messages to devices. So you already have some
baby steps in this direction.
I suspect doing this fully generalized would be quite difficult
because there would be so many people you have to convince.

Well the kernel will always have limited buffers, so the someone
needs to listen problem will be always there.
There are not __that__ many I think.
Also whatever code handles this has to have special code for
all of these anyways, so having a variety of interfaces for them
doesn't seem like the end of the world to me.

Sure sounds nice. But frankly I don't see it happening. It would
be just too radical a change of too much code.
