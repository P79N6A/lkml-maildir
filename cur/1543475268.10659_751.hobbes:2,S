Couldn't this be solved by supplying a default value for CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV (off -
it is only a rather obscure backward compatibility option) ?

Bad.
Would it be possible to give error messages for missing choices? 
if CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER = y -a CONFIG_RTNETLINK != y ; then
		error "Sorry, advanced router needs rtnetlink. Enable it and try again." 
fi 
I am no expert on the Configure system, but how hard would it be to implement
such a thing in config/menuconfig/xconfig ?

I can understand your problems, but I think making ADVANCED_ROUTER depend
on RTNETLINK would be a mistake (because it is merely an implementation detail)
