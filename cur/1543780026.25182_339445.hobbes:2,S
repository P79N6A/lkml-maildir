It is not a work around. These are text attributes meant for human
use.  Humans have a hard time cleaning up things they can't see. And
the failure mode for this is awful, your attribute won't set but
everything on the screen looks fine.
echo is not the only source of problems. I had some trailing
whitespace in a shell script and it took me a couple of hours to
discover why the attribute set was failing. I finally had to add debug
code to the kernel and reboot to located the problem. Normal users are
never going to figure this out.
Binary attributes are for program use, they should not get cleaned up.
If you dont want the whitespace cleaning switch to a binary one.
