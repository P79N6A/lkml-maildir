Martin was talking about some mad scheme wherin you'd create a bunch of
pseudo files (say, /proc/foo/0, /proc/foo/1, ..., /proc/foo/9) and each one
would become "ready" when the MM scanning priority reaches 10%, 20%, ... 
100%.
Obviously there would need to be a lot of abstraction to unhook a permanent
userspace feature from a transient kernel implementation, but the basic
idea is that a process which wants to know when the VM is getting into the
orange zone would select() on the file "7" and a process which wants to
know when the VM is getting into the red zone would select on file "9".
It get more complicated with NUMA memory nodes and cgroup memory
controllers.
