Hi all,
The patch looks good for 2.6.17-rc1. Christoph, did you already make the second patch for the real switchover? 
Will only the scsi_allocate_request()/scsi_do_req()/scsi_release_request() be removed in the next kernel releases? - I'm wondering if I could use the scsi_get_command()/scsi_put_command() functions to get a Scsi_Cmnd struct. and to send it to the gdth_queuecommand()/gdth_next(). I'm willing to make and test the second patch but please give me some hints what functions you plan to kill and what function we can still use. 
Thanks & Regards,
Achim

Hi folks,
the gdth driver is the only driver using (and in this case abusing) the
scsi_request interface we plan to kill for 2.6.17.  I've sent a patch
that's a first step to convert the driver away from it a few weeks ago
but didn't get any response.  I urgently need testers to keep the driver
for 2.6.17+.  Else it'll be marked broken until we get a person to help
testing the changes needed to resurrect it.
