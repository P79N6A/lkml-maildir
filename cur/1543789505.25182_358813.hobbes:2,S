Subject: [PATCH 2.6] Allow RAMFS build as a module
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
I think a line ".owner = THIS_MODULE," should be
inserted at 
http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/ramfs/inode.c#L216
 .
Without this line, ramfs can't work safely as a module, for
it doesn't increment module usage counter,
resulting successful rmmod while ramfs is mounted
and subsequent crash.
I know ramfs in 2.6 are always built into kernel,
but someone would get troubled when
examining ramfs code for study purpose.
Best Regards.
