Just a datapoint:
The orinico driver (already in the kernel) works fine with the DWL-650 card. 
Tried it some days ago.. not a very big field trial but I inserted the card 
and I got an eth0 from it and it worked, so thats the way I like it :)
On the other hand, the driver from linux-wlan (also for prism2-based cards) 
did not compile because it required the external pcmcia-cs source-code etc..
it was not really "drop and compile". Anyway, I'm just happy one of them 
worked :)
