Well, I said it needed touch up. ;-) After all I didn't seriously believe it 
gets merged in current state (and yes, I didn't think about the module issue, 
but you're right , of course). But it simply didn't seem like dvb guys are 
caring about the problem. I once (probably half a year ago already) mailed to 
linux-dvb and got zero response. That told me everything.
Personally I won't invest more time in perfecting the patch. I just wanted to 
get some attention to this problem and will use the patch privately for my 
own happiness...
Thanks for your input.
