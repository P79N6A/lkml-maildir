Subject: NTFS problems in 2.2.0-pre4

Hello,
I would like to report some NTFS problems in the "fresh" NTFS code.
My configuration is:
- uniprocessor Pentium Pro
- 2.2.0-pre4 kernel
- gcc 2.7.2.3 or egcs 1.0.3 (does not matter)
- NTFS compiled as module with R/W support enabled
- 4.3 GB hda and 850 MB hdc
Problem #1: It does not compile
The compile fails at inode.c:421 and 423 - the reason
are undefined ntfs_s16 and ntfs_s32.
> inode.c: In function `ntfs_decompress_run':
> inode.c:421: `ntfs_s16' undeclared (first use this function)
> inode.c:421: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
> inode.c:421: for each function it appears in.)
> inode.c:423: `ntfs_s32' undeclared (first use this function)
I don't see the problem - I tried some random rearrangements
in ntfsendian.h and ntfstypes.h, but haven't found it (but
I admit that I didn't try very extensively). I changed ntfs_s16
to s16 and ntfs_s32 to s32 in ntfsendian.h, then it compiled.
Problem #2: It does not mount the same filesystems that
            the previous version does
I have two NTFS partitions on my disks - the bigger (1.2 GB)
one is on hda7 logical partition and the smaller (500 MB)
on the hdc3. I am able to mount the smaller one, but the
bigger one says "kmalloc: Size (503808) too large" to
the kernel log and refuses to mount.
Problem #3: R/W support still unusable
I tried to "touch" and edit some files on the hdc3.
The operations succeeded, even "echo bar > foo ; cat foo"
gave "bar" back, but the file is invisible in the "ls"
output and lost after remount.
It is possible that the problems have some connection with
the changes needed for the compiling, but I am not so sure.
If you want some more details or can suggest some debug
possibilities, I am willing to do some testing (I have
one ntfs partition which I don't mind reformatting :-))
As for R/W support, I think that this option should probably
not be visible in the "kernel for the masses" line, as it is
probably impossible to test it extensively enough till
the release).
Regards
