Subject: [patch][2.5.70] DRM (mga) SMP link fix (flush_tlb_all)

drivers/char/drm/drm_memory.h needs this to compile as module (at least)
on SMP, where flush_tlb_all() isn't a inline macro.
For some reason insmod/modprobe got a hard hang with this, even though
it did detect missing symbol (should've boil out at that stage?).
This hang prevents any further module loading/unloading activity, and is
very frustrating. Is it on must-fix list yet?
