I am far away from having any knowledge about the GCC internals and the
reason why this code works, but I've been told the generic way of
handling unaligned access is this:
#define get_unaligned(ptr)                      \
({                                              \
        struct __attribute__((packed)) {        \
                typeof(*(ptr)) __v;             \
        } *__p = (void *) (ptr);                \
        __p->__v;                               \
})
#define put_unaligned(val, ptr)                 \
do {                                            \
        struct __attribute__((packed)) {        \
                typeof(*(ptr)) __v;             \
        } *__p = (void *) (ptr);                \
        __p->__v = (val);                       \
} while(0)
Actually I am using this code in the Bluetooth userspace library for
over two years now without any complaints.

Marcel
