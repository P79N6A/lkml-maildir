Thank you for an informative summary.

I noticed Andrea Arcangeli repeatedly pointing out the difference
between atomicity and serialisation, and that "lock;" guarantees
atomicity not serialisation.  Yet here you suggest that "any serializing
instruction" includes the atomic ones.  What am I misunderstanding?
And the that matter, whch instructions are serialising in this way?  Is
"sfence" serialising?  What about a far jump?  (Far jump serialises the
execution unit in as much as you need one to switch between real &
protected modes, for example, but I don't think it serialises memory
accesses).
And of course, are the rules for non-Intel "x86 compatible" processors
just as strong?
thanks,
