modpost has evolved over time and when I get the time I will refactor
kbuild so we always call modpost in the final steps of the kernel build
independent on module support or not. And then is makes perfect sense
to have the check for exported symbols from illegal sections located
there.
In other words current modpost will be used also when
executing "make vmlinux". That impose a few tricky things and I have
posponed it for now. Implementing the suggested check should be possible
and will try to look at that sooner.
