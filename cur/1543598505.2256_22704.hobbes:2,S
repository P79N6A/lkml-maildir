None of the cards I have do this. Is this some kind of sparc specific
firmware problem ?

Why. What exactly is your argument ? Lets waste 128K of kernel space to keep
Dave happy. If the lack of proper boot time init on the sparc64 platform is
causing more problems then copy the firmware image out of the BIOS into the
card if sparc64 is defined.
And an initrd is the right answer. You free up the 128K of wasted space
using it.
