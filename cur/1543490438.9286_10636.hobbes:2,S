A number of responses are all suggesting to me that what we really need is
several different well-chosen scheduling strategies, and some reasonably
good way to choose one for a particular drive, if we want to squeeze out
the last drop of disk performance.  Maybe as simple as:
	if (disk is SCSI)
	{
		use bidirectional elevator
		merge reads and writes
	}
	else	/* probably a dumb IDE drive */
	{
		use one-directional elevator
		segregate reads and writes
	}

Remembering the day when disks were so primitive that each pack had a
slotted ring which would interrupt a beam of light to inform the drive of
the sector boundaries.
