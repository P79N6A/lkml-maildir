In the ix86 architecture (and it is in arch-specific code), there
cannot be anything at this address except a floppy or nothing.
In both cases, you are covered.
I any embedded systems developer decides to put something besides
a FDC at that address, it is up to them to fix the problems they
create, not linux.

The BIOS accesses the floppy (if one exists) because of the
boot order having been selected. Many who have computers,
that are not accessible to others, have the BIOS set up so
that the first thing to check for a boot-loader is the floppy,
then the CD-ROM, then the hard disk. This lets them do their
normal work without having to muck with the BIOS.
It is not an error to configure a machine this way. It
is an option. It is an error, however, to leave a floppy
disk-drive motor ON forever.

The BIOS can be (correctly) set to any of many possible boot-
options.

An arbitrary delay is a very bad hack. If you need something OFF,
you turn it OFF. One should never work-around a primative like
ON or OFF. The digital-output registers at the FDC's specified
address is where this is done.
