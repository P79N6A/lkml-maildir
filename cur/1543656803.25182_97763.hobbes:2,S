Hi all,
        Had problems booting a bk 2.5.52 pulled around 2002/12/19 03:31 PST.
It hangs after initializing the BusLogic host adapter, when it's trying to
probe the devices.
Debian woody:
gcc 2.95.4
binutils 2.12.90.0.1
module-init-tools 0.9.5
        A partial output captured via serial console with BusLogic=Debug
is attatched gzip'd due to size, along with the .config any more info needed?
