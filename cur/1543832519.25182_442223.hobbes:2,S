As far as I know they were never used and certainly aren't now.  We did
once use /dev/viocons/%d, but that went away a long time ago (before the
code was in the mainline kernel).  Major 229 is now used by the pSeries
Hypervisor consoles (/dev/hvc%d) and hopefully soon by a new iSeries
hypervisor console with the same name.
