  This reminds me I had something similar happening about a year or so ago
running with Debian's unstable xorg and gnome.
  The keys would stick for a short time (no, no coffee spilled on the keyboard,
I can assure you ;-), the most annoying one being the delete key. Nothing
deterministic, it could happen anytime (or not at all for several days).
  As a final resort, I upgraded the xorg and gnome packages - problem solved.
  Sébastien.
