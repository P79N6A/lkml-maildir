I think you should ask maintainers of those drivers to fix their asm code.
The issue is well documented in the gcc info pages:
      "It is an error for a clobber description to overlap an input or
   output operand (for example, an operand describing a register class
   with one member, mentioned in the clobber list).  Most notably, it is
   invalid to describe that an input operand is modified, but unused as
   output.  It has to be specified as an input and output operand anyway."
