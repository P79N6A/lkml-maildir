I am guessing that it is not a bug in acpid since stop it didn't help.
You could try a
cat /proc/acpi/event
to make sure that you are actually getting these events no stop.
I am guessing that it is a faulty dsdt since you got the same the
behavior on the different kernel.
Can you tell if this also happens with 2.4 kernel?
