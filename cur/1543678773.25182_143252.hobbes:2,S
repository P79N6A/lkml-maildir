We're up to the projects starting with "p" and through all the ppc trees.
So far everything is checking out clean after a few manual fixups.
We "downgraded" to 2.4.21 from ~2.5.70 because of what we think are file
system or IDE corruption problems.  If anyone else is running on a 
serverworks IDE chipset (Tyan dual PIII MB) and has hit problems with
2.4.21 I'd be deeply grateful for a heads up.
