Yes, TOMOYO does so too.
Although TOMOYO is not using LSM, TOMOYO checks it by manually inserted hooks
that are called after resolving the symbolic links.

Conventional UNIX's access control can't restrict
which path_to_file can link with which another_path_to_file
because UNIX's access control is a label-based access control.
Therefore "ln /etc/shadow /tmp/harmless" becomes a problem
when introducing pathname-based access control.
TOMOYO checks the combination of both link source and destination,
using "allow_link path_to_link_source path_to_link_destination" syntax.
Therefore "ln /etc/shadow /tmp/harmless" is impossible as long as
"allow_link /etc/shadow /tmp/harmless" (or something like "allow_link /etc/\* /tmp/\*")
is not given. TOMOYO checks rename operation as well using
"allow_rename path_to_oldname path_to_newname" syntax.

But TOMOYO checks not only the capability to call mount() system call
but also the combination of "path_to_device" "path_to_mountpoint" and "filesystem_type"
using "allow_mount path_to_device path_to_mountpoint filesystem_type"
("allow_mount --bind path_to_bind_source path_to_bind_destionation" for bind mounts) syntax.
And, this is why this very long long thread began.
One of the reasons that TOMOYO doesn't use LSM is that
it is impossible to obtain "struct vfsmount" parameter inside some of LSM hook functions.
 From the label-based access control's point of view,
bind mount interferes nothing with label based access control
and passing "struct vfsmount" parameter looks redundant.
But, from the pathname-based access control's point of view,
bind mount interferes severely with pathname-based access control
because it is impossible to determine which pathname was requested.
Although both pathnames point to the same object,
TOMOYO focuses on the PROCEDURE FOR REACHING AN OBJECT
and being able to know the procedure is very important.
(In contrast, SELinux focuses on the ATTRIBUTE OF THE REQUESTED OBJECT, doesn't it?)

I don't think so.
I think the pathname-based access control and the label-based access control are
complementarity relation. TOMOYO can coexist with SELinux and AppArmor.
What is sad, it becomes impossible to coexist with SELinux and AppArmor if TOMOYO uses LSM.
Thanks.
