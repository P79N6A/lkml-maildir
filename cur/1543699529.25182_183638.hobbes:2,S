Hi All,
    I need some pointers for using shared memory .... if this isn't the
place to ask then certainly suggest another.
Assume I have all of the physical RAM I need ... I want to be able to use
the maximum amount of shared memory for memory mapped files. I'm guessing
the largest SHM segment I can expect is 4GB .. correct???
What else competes for shared memory??? (ramdisks??? initrd???)
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Rob
