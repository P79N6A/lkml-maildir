I realize the page fault handler is the only performance critical event,
but don't all the debugging events _REALLY_ deserve a seperate call chain?
They are _completely_ seperate and isolated events.  One is a minor event
which a small number of other userland processes are concerned with.
The other is indicating the machine is about stop running and is only
relevant to critical system infrastructure.
When I get back from vacation on Tuesday, I will try to work up a patch
which introduces a notify_debug() call and its call chain.  Maybe that
will initiate more discussion.
Thanks,
Robin
