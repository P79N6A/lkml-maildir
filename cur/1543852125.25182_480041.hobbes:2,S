The man page is not particularly helpful either as it simply indicates:
    "The st_blksize field gives the preferred blocksize for efficient 
file system  I/O. "
but it appears that blksize would affects readdir performance more than 
read/write
(since read/write go through the pagecache and thus readpages/writepages
will request readahead/writebehind for many pages at a time) unless the 
application
opens the file direct i/o.
