Hi,
I managed to get through kernel decompression by putting enough watchdog resets calls in zlib functions (the watchdog can not be shut off ).
- now I am stuck at booting the kernel ...
- cursor "blinks" quite for a long time after I see the last printout in load_kernel(), that is: "Now booting the kernel"  - 
I suspect it is watchdog issue again ...
How watchdog resetting is handled for 82xx (I think 8xx will be similar ?) in Linux 2.6 on the kernel level ?
Does one need to add code for it or is it supported "off the shelf" ?
Is "early printk" supported for 82xx on 2.6 (I think 8xx will be similar ?)?
If yes - how and where it could be enabled?
Thanks,
Alex
