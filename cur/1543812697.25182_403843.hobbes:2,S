Yes, I tried ppc64 vs ppc and it still comes out the same.
Unfortunately I don't have any sparc handy to try.
The fundamental question seems to be whether things like
	struct foo {
		struct sockaddr_in6 src;
		struct sockaddr_in6 dst;
	};
and
	struct bar {
		struct sockaddr_in6 a;
		__u32 b;
	};
end up being packed, even though struct sockaddr_in6 is 28 bytes in
size.  And as far as I can tell, they always do, I guess because the
individual fields of struct sockaddr_in6 are all <= 32 bits.
