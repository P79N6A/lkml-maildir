Gah.  That's your fault.  Use diff -p in future; I saw:

which makes it look like the dcounters are added to ext2_bg_info.
diff -p would have put the name of the struct after the @@ line.  Not to
mention you didn't follow the `s_' prefix style used everywhere else in
that struct.
Anyway, I think dcounters should probably be allocated from kmalloc_percpu()
rather than as part of the dcounter struct.
