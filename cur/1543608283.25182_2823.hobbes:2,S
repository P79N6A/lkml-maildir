Is there any resources(such as programming guide or referrence book) for the C language grammar in gcc, especially for Kernel? Such as what is _init, 1<<12, asmlinkage, etc?
Thanks
Noah

See 
http://kernelnewbies.org
 for some introduction to kernel hacking...
The books "Understanding the Linux Kernel" and "Linux Device Drivers",
both published by O'Reilly, are good starts.
As for the VM, there doesn't seem to be _anything_ yet.  Hopefully soon?
