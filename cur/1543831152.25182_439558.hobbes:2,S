Looks good to me. Do we want to keep a PERCPU flag too ? I don't really
need it anymore on powerpc as I just use the percpu flow handler and I'm
not allowing sharing of IPIs but others might.
Also, I'd like to store the IRQ types in the irq_desc regardless of the
actions that have been registered or not. Any suggestion where to put
that ? The current type values conflict with other desc->status bits at
the moment unless we shift the whole thing up...
Ben.
