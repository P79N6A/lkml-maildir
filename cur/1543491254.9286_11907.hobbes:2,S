Hello all,
Is there an issue with NR_FILE, etc in 2.2.x kernels? I needed to run
Informix Dynamic Server 7.30.U on kernel 2.2 and because of a host of
errors, I increased NR_FILE, NR_OPEN, and __FD_SETSIZE from the default
(1024 I think) to 4096.
I'm aware that Alan Cox increased NR_FILE to 4096 in 2.2.3 (from the old
1024) but that did not solve the IDS problems, NR_OPEN and __FD_SETSIZE
also had to be bumped up.
This got rid of the errors when starting up IDS (someone on the Informix
development team said that IDS does several select(4096,..) calls which
require bumping up those limits).
However this broke several programs that use select(). Interestingly
enough, all of these broken programs are terminal emulators derived from
rxvt (xiterm, aterm, Eterm, rxvt itself). xterm is unaffected.
Is this a libc issue? (I am using glibc-2.0.7 from Red Hat 5.2). Any hints
as to how I can fix this? (transparent terminals are SO nice, but I need
IDS running too)
