Experience over on the Windows side of the fence indicates that "remote bad
guys get some local user first" is a *MAJOR* part of the current real-world
threat model - the vast majority of successful attacks on end-user boxes these
days start off with either "Get user to (click on link|open attachment)" or
"Subvert the path to a website (either by hacking the real site or hijacking
the DNS) and deliver a drive-by fruiting when the user visits the page".
