Well, sort-of.  rlimits affect the number of open files, not the actual fd
indices.  But whatever.

OK, so the existing code doesn't support a holey bitmap.

a) Were IDR trees evaluated and if so, why were they rejected?
b) it's a bit disappointing that this new allocator is only usable for
   one specific application.  We have a *lot* of places in the kernel which
   want allocators of this type.  Many of them are open-coded and crappy. 
   Some use IDR trees.
   If we're going to go and add a complete new allocator, it would be
   good to position it as a library thing if poss.
