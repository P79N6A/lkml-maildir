See previous posting. BTW, -pre5 doesn't do the right thing in clear_inode().
Scenario: bh of indirect block is busy (whatever reason, flush_dirty_buffers(),
anything that can bump ->b_count for a while). ext2_truncate() frees the
thing and does bforget(). bh is left on the inode's list. Woops...
The minimal fix would be to make clear_inode() empty the list. IMO it's
worse than preventing the freed stuff from being on that list...
