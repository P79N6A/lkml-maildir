This is not a kernel code issue, but it has caused me some difficulties,
not to mention embarassment, and I wonder if someone there can explain:
$diff -u -r -N  vanilla11 linux-new11 > junk &
$ diff -u -r --new-file  vanilla11 linux-new11 > junk2 &
time passes and 
$ ls -l junk*

Two "diffs" only difference is "--new-file" and "-N" which should
be identical
$ diff --version
diff - GNU diffutils version 2.7
Stock Rdhat 6.0
The hyphen in the second directory name? 
Control-c'ing during a make?
Microsoft moles ? Something stupid I did ?
The kernel is 2.3.11 -- the vanilla one, not my version that I 
was getting a diff for.
When I copied these directories to a second machine, I got similar
results until I removed the vanilla11 directory and made a new
one from a fresh tar file.
