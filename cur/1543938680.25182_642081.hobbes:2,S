But 100 callouts holding spinlocks will not work for our implementation
and even if the callouts are made with spinlocks released, we would very
strongly prefer a single callout which messages the range to the other
side.

For our RDMA rmap, it is based upon physical address.

Our rmap takes a physical address and turns it into mm+va.

PageLocked(page) should work, right?  We already have a backoff
mechanism so we expect to be able to adapt it to include a
PageLocked(page) check.
