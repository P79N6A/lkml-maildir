I had to gank a few servers of different versions and giving the webhosting customers some little inconvience of downtime of 3 to 10 minutes for the linux recompile and reboot.  And they all finally reports the number of processors correctly as it should be.

As for the servers, they are all usually ServerWorks, Intel Chipsets of various types with Intel E1000, E100, Realtek network ports and with 3Ware or SCSI Adaptec adapters.  Got about 80 of them in various types to go though, but 5 of them I that tested it on, it all reports correctly.
