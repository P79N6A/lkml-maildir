I'm not sure that I correctly understand what you want. You mean that
the Calgary IOMMU code ignores device's dma_mask and gives addresses
above 4GB or the Calgary IOMMU code wrongly handles devices that are
not behind the Calgary?
If you refers to the former problem, other IOMMU implementations do
something like this.
