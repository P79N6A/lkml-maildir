And with one Maxtor 250 GB and one Seagate 250 GB, will that work? It can go
wrong on two accounts; the geometry issue I desbribed (which, I understand,
shouldn't be an issue at all), and if you're trying to clone the partition
table on a smaller disk. The latter would be fixed by leaving some unpartioned
space available.
This is something I'm going to experiment with on several disks I have.
On a sidenote, can you use this command, along with "dd if=oldpartition
of=newpartition" to clone an old disk to a new one (including NTFS/FAT
partitions for example), like Seagate disk wizzard does, and have a working
bootable system on the new disk? Or, can that even be done by dd-ing the
entire disk, and not individual partitions? I can remember G4u being
uncomfortable with that.
