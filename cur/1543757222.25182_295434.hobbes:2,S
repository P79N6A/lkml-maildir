OK, that makes sense.

This is memory on a PCI card which is definitely not part of
ordinary ram.

Since I wrote the driver, thats definitely a possibility.

Ahh, here's a clue. My driver uses ioremap_nocache() to get virtual
pointers to physical register/memory (addresses obtain using 
pci_resource_start etc) on the card and calls iounmap() when the 
driver is unloaded. However, while the driver is loaded, the user 
space program mmaps a superset of the same memory. Is it possible 
that this is screwing up the page accounting?

The driver is very strict about mapping memory on load and
unmapping memory on unload. I'm pretty confident that this is
working correctly because the driver can be repeatedly loaded
and unloaded without errors. During normal operation, it does 
not fiddle with mmapping.

Its a driver I wrote for a piece of hardware designed by the 
company I work for.

Nope, very, very unlikely. My driver is not doing anything 
complicated with memory mapping and I know the user space code 
is reading the right memory location because the read data is 
valid.
Thanks Hugh. Your input was very helpful.
