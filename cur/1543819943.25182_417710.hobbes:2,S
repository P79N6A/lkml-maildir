It happens occasionally.  The problem here is that I want to call this from
three different places, but if I drop the mutex before calling the burial
function, I have to get the mutex again to do the unlink; but as it is, I have
to drop it before I can do the rename:-/
It's not nice, but...
You have to note also that the directory's i_mutex is quite important for
interacting with the daemon also.  The wonders of working through an existing
filesystem, and the the wonders of co-operating with userspace.

I copied those of generic_file_buffered_write() and rearranged them a bit:-)
I'll add a comment to my function.

Ah.  Do we though?  I just copied generic_file_buffered_write() and cut it
down.  The same is done there.  The comments at the top of that function
weren't exactly forthcoming on the preconditions for calling that function.

Good point.

Yes...  Whilst I have it working with NFS, the NFS anti-aliasing problems are
still there and still need to be sorted.  I thought I'd got them nailed, but
then Trond changed his mind:-(
But that does not preclude putting what I can release up for review.
