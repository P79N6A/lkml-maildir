Looking again at this report in more detail, something
very strange is going on ...

First, you have MORE free memory than freepages.high. In this
case I really don't see why __alloc_pages() wouldn't give the
memory to your processes ....

And there is tons of swap free...
Are you absolutely sure this is VM related?  This almost looks
like the system puts a in a read request but the request queue
doesn't get unplugged, or something strange like that ...
There is more than enough memory to satisfy all VM requests and
the loop in __alloc_pages() is straightforward enough to give
your processes their memory without strange bugs ...

Rik
