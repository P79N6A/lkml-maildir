    The users of cpusets need to have system wide names for them, with
    permissions for viewing, modifying and attaching to them, and with the
    ability to list both what hardware (CPUs and Memory) in a cpuset, and
    what tasks are attached to a cpuset.  As is usual in such operating
    systems, the kernel manages such system wide synchronized controlled
    access views.
Well, you are *asserting* the kernel will manage this.  But doesn't
CKRM offer this capability?  The only thing it *can't* do is assure
exclusivity, today .. correct?
