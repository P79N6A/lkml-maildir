A user's input, of not nearly as much weight as of the input you
suggested, and totally unencumbered by technical details:
EVMS has been much more present to interested parties than LVM2. If --
as a user -- I was to choose either one RIGHT NOW (i. e. with a gun
against a head, a boss telling me 'I want a decision in 30 minutes', you
name it), I'd go for EVMS.
Not for the names behind, the LVM2 and the EVMS teams both have their
reputation, and from my POV, they are equally good.
Not for technical reasons either, because I just cannot judge on this
area.
But because EVMS just looks much less like a construction site than
dm2/LVM2 does.
If there was something about integrating dm2, I'd not be surprised if
EVMS used it or wrapped it up or something. It also usurps LVM1.
Just my two Euro cents.
