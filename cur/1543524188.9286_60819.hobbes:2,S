   There is a problem with copying headers to align them, on machines
   which need it?
It is overhead for those that need it.  But we could certainly put the
hooks in there.
However, it then is something we have to support, and new ports
will probably get lazy and just define CONFIG_ALIGN_NET_HEADERS
or whatever we will call it.
