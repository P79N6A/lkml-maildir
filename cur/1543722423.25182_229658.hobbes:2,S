  OK, I've tried forcedeth_gigabit_try19 and I still get the same
problem. The only difference is a "bad: scheduling while atomic!" in the
syslog, but I still get stuck packets.
  I've also tried reverting to the older XT-PIC and again, no
improvement.
  I'll now try to work my way through debugging the problem myself. I've
got limited experience with kernel hacking, but I'll learn along the way
:-) If anyone has got any new information or suggestion, I would like to
hear about it.
