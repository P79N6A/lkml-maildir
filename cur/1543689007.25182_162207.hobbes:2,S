If data is a local variable then this is perfectly valid example of a
C99 variable-length array (VLA). This works at least with gcc-2.95.3
and newer, and gcc handles it by itself w/o calling alloca().
Of course, VLAs should be bounded in size to avoid overflowing the
kernel stack, but that doesn't make them illegal per se.
