To mount the right partitions , refer to the by the volume label or
UUID.
( read the mount and fstab man pages for more info )
This work after the root-fs is already mounted.
Currently ( AFAIK ) the root-fs can be specified only as a major:minor
pair ( and maybe also as a "/dev/hdxx" string )
Once I wrote a patch that allows specifying the root-fs by
UUID or volume label. It is available at
http://linux-patches.rock-projects.com/v2.2-f/uuid.html
It is for 2.2.x kernel , since nobody seems to be interested in it.
As for the "device nodes are assigned to disk devices almost randomly"
problem : I complained about this years ago , but nothing happened.
If someone knows a way to reliably find a certain partition ,
regardless of the (non)existence and position of other partitions
and disks in the system , short of scanning the contents of all
available
partitions , please tell me.
Party on !
