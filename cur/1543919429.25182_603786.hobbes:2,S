Reading the patch in that link, recent cross compilers from _where_?  
Buildroot?  Cross-tools?  Gentoo embedded?  Cross Linux From Scratch?  My 
Firmware Linux project?
You assume they all use the same name, yet your patch changes them from one 
default name to another default name, presumably due to a gcc version change 
becoming increasingly political about the GNU/Linux/Dammit thing...
None of the other targets I've tried attempt to _supply_ a default.  Just like 
the Linux kernel errors out early in the build if you distclean and then try 
to run "make" without having run config first.  It doesn't run "defconfig" 
for you and continue on in that case.  But m68k, uniquely, assumes it knows 
what you want to do when you didn't tell it.  Other targets do not do this.
