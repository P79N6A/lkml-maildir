Hmm, on the subject, the primitive device driver they give, ie
#define MODULE
#include <linux/module.h>
int init_module(void) {
        printk("<1>Hello world\n");
        return 0;
}
void cleanup_module(void) {
        printk("<1>Goodbye cruel world\n");
}
Doesn't insert cleanly complaining of:
mod.o: unresolved symbol printk
I'm sure this used to work under 2.0.x, what's changed?
