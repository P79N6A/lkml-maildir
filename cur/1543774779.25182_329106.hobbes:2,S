I put in the comment and its building now.  I rather doubt its going 
to make a huge diff though as its probably the single most repeated 
bitch on the kmail lists, and has been for a long, very long as in 
years, time.  From hints dropped here and there, it might finally be 
fixed with kde-3.5.  But we'll give this a shot nontheless.  I'll add 
more after I reboot to test.
Now rebooted.
I don't think its made a noticable difference, I'm still getting the 
hangs of up to 30 seconds but I'll let it run the rest of the 
afternoon so I get a better feel for it.  It doesn't often miss a 
keystroke, they will eventually be echoed back to the screen.
