Indeed.  In case Alan's message wasn't clear: if your syscall overhead
is zero then many "optimizations" become superfluous.  In fact, those
optimizations, one cache miss at a time, tend to be a big part of what
makes the syscall layer so heavyweight.
Linux is amazing in that it is basically the only real operating system
I know of that has stayed so focussed on making the syscall layer be
almost invisible.  it's worth a "rah rah" because you can use the 
operating system like it was libc, there is basically very little 
cost in crossing in/out.
Here's the LMbench context switch benchmark running on a 1.6Ghz Athlon:

Yeah, that's more than a half a million context switchs/second and each
of those include 2 system calls.  So Linux is doing 2 system calls and
a context switch in 1.8 microseconds.
When you can get in and out of the kernel that fast, your thinking should 
change.  You get to use the kernel more freely.  And you certainly don't
want to do anything to screw that up.  My hat is off to Linus and team 
for working so hard to make these numbers be so good (and keep on working,
see the recent syscall discussion).
