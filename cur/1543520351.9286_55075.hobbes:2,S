I think you fixed the symptoms instead of the problem: I think we should
fix smp_call_function():
* 2 concurrent panic() calls will still lock-up on SMP.
* if one cpu executes flush_tlb_all(), and the second cpu executes
panic(), then panic() would schedule()...
* the mtrr code could schedule() after preparing one cpu for the mtrr
change [ie schedule() with disabled caches, perhaps then a mtrr change
with enabled caches...]
The fix for mtrr is simple [attached below], but I don't know how to
solve smp_send_stop().
