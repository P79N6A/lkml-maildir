Yes it was the same kernel even.

Unfortunately it didn't compile with the above changes and I'm totally
crap at programming :(
But I enabled debugfs and did
"echo 3 > /sys/kernel/debug/jbd2/jbd2-debug" and reproduced the problem
by taking a snapshot while the system was live.
I hope this had the same effect as your proposed change.
I also put it on this URL to make it easier to read
