Short answer: ~3-4% in a not very scientific test.
Long answer: I timed 3 different runs of a program that created and then closed 
a pipe 10 million times on a patched and unpatched kernel. I then added up the
"system" times for each and divided them:
unpatched:
sys     1m53.959s
sys     1m56.083s
sys     1m48.055s
patched:
sys     1m56.899s
sys     1m57.027s
sys     1m57.031s
The result was 1.03803642150033866020.
