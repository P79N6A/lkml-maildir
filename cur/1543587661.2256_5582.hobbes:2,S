And let fsck read bad data because the raid doesn't yet recognize the correct
one....
There is nothing to fix in fsck. It should NOT know about the low level
block storage devices. If it does, then fsck for EACH filesystem will
have to know about ALL different raid hardware/software implementations.
>b) wait with fsck until rebuild is fixed
Depends on your definition of "fixed". The most I can see to fix is
reduce the amount of continued update in favor of updating those blocks
being read (by fsck or anything else). This really ought to be a runtime
configuration option. If it is set to 0, then no automatic repair would
be done.
