Consider sending this to Linus then.... ;-)

Interfaces, interfaces, interfaces.....
I suspect that this is one of the most common uses for copy_to_user.
So wouldn't it make more sense to have copy_to_user (or a variant)
return "EFAULT" when it doesn't work?
That would make the code:
	return fcopy_to_user(retinfo, &tmp, sizeof (*retinfo));
Looks cleaner to me than the EFAULT case. 
When you are "designing" copy_to_user, I can understand the desire to
do something "useful" with the return value. If the majority of the
callers don't do anything else with the non-zero return than return
EFAULT, then that may instead be a good return value for the routine.
I always try to write the code that calls the "support functions"
first. As a programmer I'm lazy: I get to write clean code, knowing
that the support functions will handle the details. In the end it pays
off.

(*) I have not checked wether there are ANY users of the old return
value. If so, we may need to add a new name for a similar function.
If the total lines-of-code is reduced, then I'd say that's a good
modification.
