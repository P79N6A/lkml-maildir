Yes, but we don't have a hook for actually filling this pointer, do we ?
We should have a way, when creating a device, to fill it properly, like
platform_device_setup(struct device *new_dev, struct device *parent)
That would allow me to deal with the hierarchy thing (inheriting by
default the DMA stuff from the parent typically).
Now, the question is where is the best place to call this "hook" ?

Yes. I also remember a time where the dma mask for the DMA API was all
broken too (would not be possible to map the PCI one on top of it),
but I think that got fixed.
