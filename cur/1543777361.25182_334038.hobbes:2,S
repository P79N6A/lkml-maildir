Before 2.6.12-rc2, the console was unblanked by just
writing to the console.
For keyboardless and mouseless systems (which is my
case, embedded) this new behaviour is a bit annoying.

I have this problem since 2.6.12-rc2.
If I add back the patch hunk specified in my original
message, the blanking behaviour changes to that
present in pre-2.6.12-rc2 kernels.
I just would like to know if this new behaviour is
just intentional and makes sense to everyone (except
me :-)
Thanks for your feedback,
Albert
