This is for a serial port device.

This is for a parallel port device.  They are two logically different
things, have two distinct PCI bus entries, and so have two distinct
PCI device IDs and consequently different names.

Alan, do not apply, this will break the parport code.
If the OXSEMI_16PCI954 is _missing_, it probably ought to be _added_,
but it does not have 0x9513 as its ID and so the existing name should
not be changed.
