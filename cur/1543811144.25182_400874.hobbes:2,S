It was exciting to watch the "centrino" wireless cards go from the least
supported cards in the Linux to the near the best G and A cards from a
feature and licensing stand point (modulo the firmware restart issues).
I have a ipw2200 and have recommended it and now the ipw2915 to anyone
who has asked (myself and ipw2xxx using co-workers have taught thousands
of students and decision makers in Linux classes worldwide).
It is very disappointing to see this binary user space daemon (that must
run as root, presumably to write into /sys/) requirement. I recognize
that it is a better poison than a binary kernel module.
At the point when I'm in the market for a mini-PCI express wireless
adapter I hope there are other cards available that don't require any
kernel or userland binary pieces. I'll vote with my wallet so to speak.
