Subject: [patch 20/25]  ec3104: replace schedule_timeout() with 	msleep()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I would appreciate any comments from the janitor@sternweltens list. This is one (of
a few) places where I had to make a decision to set the state before the
call to
schedule_timeout();
This of course affected any decision to replace the code with msleep()
or not. Please inform if the other state from the one I used is desired.
Thanks,
Nish
Description: Uses msleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee
the task delays at least the desired time amount.
