OK, so since we've now amply worked out in this thread that TLB/cache flushing
is a real problem for context switching management, would it be possible to
smartly reorder processes on the runqueue (probably works best with many active
processes with the same/similar priority on the runqueue!) to minimize
TLB flushing needs due to less mm context differences of adjacently scheduled
processes?
(i.e. don't immediately switch from user process 1 to user process 2 and
back to 1 again, but always try to sort some kernel threads in between
to avoid excessive TLB flushing)
