Hello,
	i would like to know if there's a way to disable the screen blanker in
linux ??
Thanks a lot
Alain Toussaint
p.s. could the IDE cd driver maintainer contact me,i have tried a patch
from him but i lost his address (was trying Caldera OL 2.3 and it'd did
not work on the machine so i did a fresh install of debian and i lost
his address)
