You have a good idea...But what goes is it really when the person can just
go ahead a recompile a kernel...replace the current one and then cause the
system to "crash".  Unless of course you are booting off of some sort of
read-only media(A write protected floppy comes to mind).  Also, another
idea, backdoor insmod/modprobe so that your special module doesn't get
loaded again in the future.  Its really impossible to protect the machine
from root.  Sure you can keep them out of the kernel level stuff.  But
what good is that really?  The root user could still do nasty things to
your system regardless.
