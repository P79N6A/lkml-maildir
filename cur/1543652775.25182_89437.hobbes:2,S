Sure, but vger and ftp are both suffixed with "kernel.org"   If 
Transmeta or Red Hat ever flake out, it's easier to redirect the domain 
to some other machine.
If nothing else it's consistent naming that keeps with the Principle of 
Least Surprise :)

Check out Martin's original announcement, as well as his recent one. 
I'm pretty pleased:  they have staff that will help triage bugs and keep 
the garbage level low.  Hopefully leaving the kernel hackers to do 
nothing more than fix bugs :)
