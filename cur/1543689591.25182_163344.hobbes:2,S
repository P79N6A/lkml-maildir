Subject: [PATCH] pktgen divides by zero on short runs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/5/18

On very short runs when computing the packets per second the time that is
used can be zero. For small packets this can happen with as many as 100,
maybe more, packets. The patch below checks the denominator before
dividing and if it is zero puts a notice in the results output that
explains why pbs, bps and mbps are all zero, like so
Result: OK: 10(c10+d0) usec, 1 (64byte,0frags) 0pps 0Mb/sec (0bps) \
  (Time too short to measure) errors: 0
Hope this hasn't already been addressed (it was present in 2.6.0-test4,
which is what I generated the patch from), also this is my first
submission, so if I did it all wrong, I will accept the appropriate
punishment.
