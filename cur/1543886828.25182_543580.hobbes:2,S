        /* Here is what the APIC error bits mean:
           0: Send CS error
           1: Receive CS error
           2: Send accept error
           3: Receive accept error
           4: Reserved
           5: Send illegal vector
           6: Received illegal vector
           7: Illegal register address
        */
So the 40 means the APIC got an illegal vector.
Certainly this is consistent with the fact that
the errors start when a specific device is being
used.  I assume that device is using MSI?
Curious that it is different in 32-bit and 64-bit mode.

pci=nomsi, works, okay...

for what it is worth, the bit in ACPI that is used to
disable MSI support is not set -- so as  far as the BIOS
is concerned, this system should support MSI.
Is it an add-in card, or lan-on-motherboard?
