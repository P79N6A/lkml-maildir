Yes, but that is handled in /etc/modules.conf, with the following:
pre-install opl3 modprobe pas2
Now any attempt to use opl3 (modprobe opl3, or opening the device
and have the kernel auto-load it) will ensure pas2 is loaded first.
No problem if pas2 is loaded already.
I don't know, but if opl3 *requires* pas2 at all time in this case, also
use
pre-remove pas2 rmmod opl3
Even this could be automated by having opl3 depend on pas2,
but that would bloat the config system as not all opl3 users are pas16
users.
