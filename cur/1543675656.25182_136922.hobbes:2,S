This should be at least PRI2, as it will change the user-visible interface,
e.g. the bus_id format for CCW devices.

The 'not for your list' actually referred to the items below...

Keep this as PRI3. It would be really nice to have, but I don't expect
it to be stable before 2.6.0. The current code is the same as in 2.4.

Ok. We're only waiting for the OK from our lawyers before these 
can be submitted. The qeth driver is ugly, but is the one for
the most common hardware, so it would be nice to have it included
eventually.

These three drivers are not fully ported to 2.5 as they are less
important and we have no plan of submitting them for either 2.4
or 2.[567]. The code is also too ugly to be accepted anyway, so you
can drop them from the list. Vendors can pick up the source
from out developerworks site, as always...

No. An official release of the zfcp driver should be available at 
the end of this year for linux-2.6. If you want to look at the
code, Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com> can probably
send you a snapshot of his current working version.
