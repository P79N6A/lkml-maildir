Hi Alan,

Could you create directories in your people/akpm/* directory for patches
that are accepted/needed/bugfixes/whatever sent for -mm patches after you
submit the respective patch?
Like:
.../people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test5-mm1/pending/01_debugfix_patch.diff
.../people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test5-mm1/pending/02_other_bugfix.diff
Those would be applied over test5-mm1 to get it going, before you publish
newer patches.
Is this fine with you?
I think that testers would be happy with that.
Regards,
Maciej
