    Hi Mike :)
>Is there a logical reason why a process can't mmap more than a 2G file?
    Seems to be the value of TASK_MAX if you don't have HIGHMEM.
    Moreover, if you try to mmap a size between TASK_MAX and
ULONG_MAX, you hit a corner case that I fixed in the -ac series, the
2.5.x series and other trees, *except* the 2.4.x 'official', because
Marcelo doesn't apply the patch (three lines... trivial I think).
