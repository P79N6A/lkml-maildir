I'm going to ignore the overhead stated above here. And please take the 
following as a comment/personal opinion you may as well ignore. But I'm 
somewhat irritated, so:
<sarcasm>
So users are dumb in general, why not apply the "Single user linux" 
patch? If you don't remember:

Honestly, if you don't offer a patchless option to tighter security you 
can't estimate usage.
Given that LSM becomes a standard part of the kernel it would be easy 
for distros to offer "trusted" installations based on LSM. And in this 
case advanced security will spread.

For the next few years 99% of the linux users won't use GBit ethernet, 
so why don't you remove these drivers from the kernel?
If things should be only added to the kernel if there's already 
sufficient users my opinion is that development would come to a grinding 
halt.
