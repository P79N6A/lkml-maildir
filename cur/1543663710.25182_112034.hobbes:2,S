Four or five years ago the claim was that IA64 would solve all the large
memory problems.  Commercial viability and substantial market presence
is still lacking.  x86-64 has the same uphill battle.  It has a better
architecture for highmem and potentially better architecture for large
systems in general (compared to IA32, not substantially better than, say,
IA64 or PPC64).  It also has at least one manufacturer looking at high
end systems.  But until those systems have some recognized market share,
the boys with the big pockets aren't likely to make the ubiquitous.
The whole thing about expenses to design and develop combined with the
ROI model have more influence on their deployment than the fact that it
is technically a useful architecture.
