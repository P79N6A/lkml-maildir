I actually agree with the general sentiment, but,
Then you have to fix all the code which has assumed such, breaking
previously-correct code.  bcrl (IIRC) was the one who told me about
kfree doing the NULL check; likewise akpm for brelse.  So people are
using these things.
Do you really want to audit every single kfree and brelse to implement
this change?
