I've applied, tagged, and updated
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jcm/module-init-tools/devel/module-init-tools.git
I also moved the remaining files over from kerneltools.org. Will update
tarballs later...FWIW, there are a couple of outstanding patches to
libify module-init-tools that I'm still looking at before pushing.
Jon.
