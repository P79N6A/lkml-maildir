I can't believe I am going to do this.  Especially, where most of my
contributions to OSS/Free Software are not known on this list and the
argument is stupid.
McVoy, changing the protocol would be extremely stupid.  However, it is
your product, so do as you wish.
Stallman, believe it or not, you used to be someone I looked up to a
great deal.  I still think some of your ideas are great and I would love
to see the entire world as open source.  However, to encourage people to
do things that are known to antagonize others is crazy.  CVS is crap.  I
haven't used Bitkeeper but I have tried a lot of others, and they are
junk.  So, if Bitkeeper is as good as Linus et al think it is, then it
would be insane to do anything to ruin the relationship they have with
Bitkeeper.  Ideology is great, but it does have to be tempered and meted
out so that it can be implemented in a way that brings the most good to
everyone.  At this point, ticking off McVoy will likely do the opposite.
McVoy, thank you for helping Linus, Cox, Miller et al scale better.  As
I have said before, I hope there is some way your software can become
more open, but I will leave that up to you and your team to figure out
when and how.
Have a good one everyone.
Trever
