Subject: Cheap lock for user mode processes release when process exits

Hi all,
Maybe someone here knows better.
I have several user-mode processes using shared mmap.  There can be several reader processes and only one writer.  Readers access the shared region frequently, writer seldom.
Naturally, multi-reader/single-writer locks works best.  I tried this with futex on 2.6.9-42.EL.  However, if one of the processes is killed/exits, the lock doesn't get released.
I can trap the signal to release the lock, but not all signals like kill.
Anyway I can achieve this without a potential deadlock?
Thanks,
Michael
