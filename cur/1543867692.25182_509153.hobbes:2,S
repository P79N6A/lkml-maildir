No, it is not the same. DualFS uses two 'logical' devices, one for data, 
and one for meta-data, but these devices are usually partitions on the 
same disk, they are not two different disks. And DualFS uses the meta-data 
device to both read and write meta-data blocks, whereas the other 
journaling file systems only use the log to write meta-data.
It's true that XFS, Ext3 and other journaling file systems can use a 
separate disk for the log, but, even then, they have to write two copies 
of every meta-data element. However, in this case, DualFS is even better.
If the data and meta-data devices of DualFS can be on different disks, 
DualFS is able to READ and WRITE data and meta-data blocks in PARALLEL. 
The other journaling file systems, however, can only write one of the two 
copies of every meta-data block in parallel to other file systems 
operations, but they can not write the second copy, and read and write 
data and meta-data blocks, in parallel.

The patch for 2.6.11 is not still stable enough to be released. Be patient
