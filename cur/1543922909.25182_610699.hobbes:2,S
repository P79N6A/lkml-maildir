Not surprising :).  shmem doesn't get along too well with cpusets.

Personally, I'm of the opinion "if it hurts when you do that, don't do
that".  I have uses for shared memory and mempolicies on the same, but
they don't involve sharing shmem [nor mapped files] between cpusets nor
dynamically changing cpusets.  So, my approach would be to document the
issues clearly [another reason I'd like to see cpuset man pages] and
make sure that folks can't accidentally trip over them.  But, I suppose
all the documentation in the world won't stop some people from hurting
themselves.  As my grandmother used to tell me, "children and fools
shouldn't play with sharp tools."  [Then she'd always ask me, "Which one
are you?"  I guess time has answered that question...]
