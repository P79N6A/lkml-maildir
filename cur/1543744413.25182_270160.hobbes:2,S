 The port I/O space range differs among platforms.  You get -EBUSY in a
response to a request for a range of ports outside the supported range.

 As both request_region() and request_mem_region() merely reserve
different resources in Linux structures, you can't get a different
behavior from your device depending on which one you call, if any at all,
unless you change code elsewhere at the same time.

 The former holds I/O resources mapped in the port space, whilst the
latter holds ones mapped in the memory space.  The spaces use different
cycles each at the bus the destined device is located on.
