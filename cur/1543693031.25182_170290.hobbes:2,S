Hello!
I was using the usbserial driver to connect to my PDA and was quite
surprised when I have seen kernel oops messages in /var/log/messages
after I disconnect my PDA.
A examination of /proc/kcore shown that the bug happens in line 1408 of
usbserial.c, here is a extract:
if (port->tty != NULL) {
  while (port->open_count > 0) {
    __serial_close(port, NULL);
  }
  port->tty->driver_data = NULL;
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is the line that oopses.
}
The __serial_close function is setting port->tty to NULL, so the
solution is to remove either the line 559:
...
port->open_count = 0;
port->tty = NULL;
...
or line 1408 (which seems a better solution to me).
