Linus .. why for kernel tree can't be used indent or other source 
code formater ?
If indent tool can't feet all what is neccessary or have some not ease 
solveable bugs or can't be adopted other now avalaible tool IMO *it is* 
*time* for start project with special formater for kernel source tree. 
Using it can cut all this kind dissusions :>
If indent can handle correcly kernel source tree it will be posiible place
in source root tree one .indent.pro file and add small modificatiom to 
make suit with additional "indent" target.
In case using indent neccessary patch can take only few lines :>
After this all developers before generate patches will must only pass 
"make indent" .. nothing more.
As result can be also removed Documentation/CodingStyle file (description 
about passing "make indent" before generate patches can be moved to 
Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
