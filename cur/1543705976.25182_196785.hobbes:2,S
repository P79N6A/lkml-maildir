Who decides that the kernel is too old? Can't log-in over the
network on a machine that has a lot of uptime. Telnet to the
mail-server does work, though. It's just that shells don't
seem to work anymore!!!

It wouldn't let me log in at the console either, got the "init spawing
too fast..." message. Nothing in the logs. It's a generic RH with
the Linux-2.4.18-14 that it came with, never been hacked and used
as an internal mail-forwarding machine. It's been up since, probably
last April.
I couldn't find that "FATAL:" string in /bin/bash, in any
/lib/libc* files, nor in vmlinux. It's in /bin/rpm and in
/bin/ash.static. These are not used to log-in (I hope).
It's also in a bunch of /sbin files, never used to log in
(like e2fsck).
I crashed it and it rebooted fine, little fsck activity, with
nothing in any logs that shows there was any problem whatsoever.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
