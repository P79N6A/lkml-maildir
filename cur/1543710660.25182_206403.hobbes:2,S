yes, I would suggest so. If anybody can find any swap-regression on
small UP machines then reporting to us on l-k will be welcome. So far
nobody could notice any swap difference at swap regime AFIK, and the
improvement for the fast path is dramatic on the big smp boxes.

the 16-ways weren't numa, and these days 16-ways HT (8-ways phys) are
not so uncommon anymore.

sounds good, thanks.
I don't see other ways to optimize it (and I never enjoyed too much the
per-zone lru since it has some downside too with a worst case on 2G
systems). peraphs a further optimization could be a transient per-cpu
lru refiled only by the page reclaim (so absolutely lazy while lots of
ram is free), but maybe that's already what you're doing when you say
"Adding/removing sixteen pages for one taking of the lock". Though the
fact you say "sixteen pages" sounds like it's not as lazy as it could
be.
