I've not yet verified this on 2.2.0pre4-ac2, but will, if it compiles
today ;-}
This seems to happen when I yank the rug out from under XDM/WDM - I get
one more PS/2 Mouse and "trying to free IRQ12" message each time.
The machine is: intel 200mmx, 64m (still seeing page storms), UP compile
XF86 3.3.2.3a
