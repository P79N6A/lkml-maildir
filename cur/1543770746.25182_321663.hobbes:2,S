If you can't use the drivers, then presumably they're no good
to be used as they are for realtime in Linux either, though :(
In which case, you may still be better off porting the driver
over and rewriting it to be hard-realtime than rewriting Linux
itself ;)
But I could be wrong. I don't pretend to have the answers (just
questions!).
