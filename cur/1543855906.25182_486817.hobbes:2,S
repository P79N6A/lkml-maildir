Possibly, if it was some kind of multi-level scheduler - i.e. a
top-level scheduler picks which container to run, and then a
configurable per-container scheduler picks a task from that container.
But (having glanced at the code even less than you) it sounded like it
was intended to be a single level scheduler, configured on a per-cpu
basis. In that case tying it to (exclusive) cpusets sounds like it
might be more reasonable.
