Hmm, no according to lspci the memory is labeled non-prefetachble, and
the pci bridge agrees with that setting too.

I tried changing it to a for loop that calles memcpy_toio with one byte
at a time, and it works fine that way (although probably less
efficient).  I expect the writeb one at a time will work too.

Yeah no kidding.

I honestly don't know.  I am just trying to figure out why the jsm
driver isn't working on this system while it works on other types of
hardware, and so far it seems to come down to the __memcpy assembly not
being happy on the SC1200 doing more than one byte at a time.  it is
very consistently making the same mistake all the time.
