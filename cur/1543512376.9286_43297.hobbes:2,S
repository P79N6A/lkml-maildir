	   My feeling is that at that time people were out to lunch, and
	   the load of the server was very light.
Sorry, I wasn't explicit enough about what I meant by "load".  What kind
of server is it?  What sort of pattern of use does the filesystem
receive --- i.e., what is the filesystem's workload imposed by the
applications running on your system?
