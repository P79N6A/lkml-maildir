Hi!
I want to tell you that 2.6.0-test gets better and better. It works very
very well on several systems. Thank you very much, guys.
I have an server (like in the subject). The problem is that the scheduler
seems to behave weird. Sometimes a program just do nothing. There is no
disk activity, interrupts are a little over 1000, no disk requests,
context switches are ~40. The system is idle but it has work to do!
Can I provide more info?
I tried to put elevator=deadline and things seems worse.
If I'm not mistaken, the processes are in D state. Bt I'm not sure, I must
check again and right now I can't.
Also I suspect that scheduler doesn't pay special attention to virtual
(HT) processors. Is this true?
I have not seen this problem on other machines.
Thank you.
