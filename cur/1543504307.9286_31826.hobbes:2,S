If you're not going to handle the potential priority inversion to
prevent priority deadlock, then you might as well label the config
options
Enable TOY_SCHED_RT (enable possible priority deadlock) [N]?
Enable TOY_SCHED_IDLE (enable possible priority deadlock) [N]?
"Can deadlock" is synonymous with "don't use this." Is this the
real goal, to just have an experimental real-time and/or minimal
priority scheduler that is not dependable, to try out different paths
through the scheduler?
comp.realtime: "Hey, if it's too slow with priority inheritance, we'll run
it on something else, but allowing priority inversion is not an option."
