I don't think that these address my question. I was asking about when
building (upgrading) glibc from source. I believe that the glibc
headers are "derived" from the kernel against which it is built. So,
irrespective of what the glibc maintainers do, would it be advisable
for the user to remove the symlinks and copy the directories from the
kernel tree and into /usr/include?
