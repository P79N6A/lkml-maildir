As a gross generalisation in the PC world:
The computers with all kinds of funky SCSI controllers and network
settings and no `multimedia' drivers are `servers'.
The computers with IDE, sound cards, maybe TV and radio cards too,
and quite simple network setup are `workstations'.
It would be short-sighted to set these generalisations about drivers
`in stone', though.
