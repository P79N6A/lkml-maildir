Nope.  The number of threads is never allowed to fall below two,
for this very reason.
If the machine is super-low on memory, attempts to start more threads
fail (usually due to the 1-order allocation for the kernel stack).
I've seen this happen.  But the existing two threads are safe,
and that's plenty to get the machine out of trouble.
