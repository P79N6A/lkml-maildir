gcc already allows you to check for constants that means you can
generate
	(is a constant ? inline: noninline)(to, from, len)
and I would hope gcc does the right thing. Similarly your switch will 
be optimised out so the default case for the constant one can be the
invocation of uninlined code and it should optimise back to the straight
expected call.
