As I explained previously: I will continue to maintain the supermount 
patch due to popular request. However since it adds no performance 
feature to -ck and makes the patchset more complicated making debugging 
more difficult I will not include it by default. Having said that, I 
haven't had any bug reports about it in a long time. It's a simple 
matter to add it to -ck if you want it.
Cheers,
Con
