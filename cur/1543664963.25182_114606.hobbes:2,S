It's not a bug, really.  The fact of the matter is that the disk
geometry probe in bootsect.S pretty much only works for legacy
floppies... no IDE floppies, no USB floppies, no virtual floppies.
That, and the 1 MB limitation, is the reason it either needs to get
nuked or get some massive surgery.  I am currently trying to get Linus
to accept a patch to put it out of its misery.
