You can't compare it like that. Actually, drive letters are more like
bind mounts from "device names" to drive letters. In fact, net drives
are not IDE or SCSI or USB at all, yet they have a drive letter. So the
real CDROM for example is, IIRC, sth. like \\Device\Cdrom0 (it's not a
network path even if it looks like).
