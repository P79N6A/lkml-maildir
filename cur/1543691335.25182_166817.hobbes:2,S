I've noticed two problems compiling 2.4.22.
1) make xconfig doesn't like the font selection options.
   You can't select yes or no.  The other config programs
   worked fine.
2) If sysctl support is not selected everything compiles
   fine but the final link fails:
arch/sparc64/kernel/kernel.o: In function `sys32_sysctl':
arch/sparc64/kernel/kernel.o(.text+0x1a228): undefined reference to `do_sysctl'
It looks like the 32-bit compatibility wrapper for sysctl
needs to be conditionalized on CONFIG_SYSCTL.
Thanks,
-Ross
