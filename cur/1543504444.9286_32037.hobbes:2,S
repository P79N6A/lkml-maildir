This is a good question, I see three two to tackle this:
1. Lower the limit and just give EFAULT for all new setgroups() calls.
2. Do not allow the limits for the kernel/ngroup_max paramter to be set
   lower than the maximum number of groups i any task.
Both has problem with the fact that an application can have been asking
for the max and that max has changed :-(...
I personaly wote for the second approch, but I do not think that this
parameter should be changed too often. The main purpose for it that I
can think of for the moment is a default (but runtime changeable) limit
of 32 groups until enough programs has been tested/fixed for more than
32 groups.
