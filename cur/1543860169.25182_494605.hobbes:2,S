This happens when the underlying "block device" disappears, the most 
prominent case being ejecting the CD while the fs is still mounted. I 
have not seen it with nfs yet, since networked fs don't have any 
real backing device and instead provide either [waiting for 
reconnection] or -EIO, i.e. proper error handling.
