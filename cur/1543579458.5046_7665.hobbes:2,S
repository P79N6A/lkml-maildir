OK, 2.4.0 kernel installed, and a new set of numbers:
test		kernel		ping-pongs/s. @ total CPU util	w/SOL_NDELAY
sample (2 skts)	2.2.18		100 @ 0.1%			800 @ 1%
sample (1 skt)	2.2.18		8000 @ 100%			8000 @ 50%
real app	2.2.18		100 @ 0.1%			800 @ 1%
sample (2 skts)	2.4.0		8000 @ 50%			8000 @ 50%
sample (1 skt)	2.4.0		10000 @ 50%			10000 @ 50%
real app	2.4.0		1200 @ 50%			1200 @ 50%
real app	Windows 2K	4000 @ 100%
The two points that still seem strange to me are:
1. The 1 socket case is still 25% faster than the 2 socket case in 2.4.0
(in 2.2.18 the 1 socket case was 10x faster).
2. Linux never devotes more than 50% of the CPU (average over a long
run) to the two processes (25% to each process, with the rest of the
time idle).
I'd really love to show that Linux is a viable platform for our SW, and
I think it would be doable if I could figure out how to get the other
50% of my CPU involved. An "strace -rT" of the real app on 2.4.0 looks
like this for each ping/pong.
