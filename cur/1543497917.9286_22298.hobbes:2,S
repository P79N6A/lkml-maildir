  You are right, but lets see; presumed 1 clock per bundle (or multiple
bundles) means the instruction stream must be at least 16 bytes wide, and
if two bundles at the time are to be executed, 32 byte memory read width
is needed.   Gee, that is quite a monster..
Of course having wide cache-cpu bus does not mandate as wide main-memory
interface.
Definitely not cheap systems.
