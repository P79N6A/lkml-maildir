I upgraded the codeset on the 3ware controller, and 2.2.17pre14
still oopses at the same point.
You can view the oops at:

2.2.17pre9 boots correctly.
Unless you suggest otherwise, I'm going to recompile 2.2.17pre9 with
the 3w-xxxx driver from the redhat 6.2 driver that I downloaded
from your website, and see if that works.
Or would you prefer I copy the version from 2.2.17pre14?
RAID 10 sure sounds like a win-win.  I'll give it a try after we
work out the current troubles.
