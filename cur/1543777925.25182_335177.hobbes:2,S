Eerrh, did you actually read my patch? The i_size of a directory is 
increased by SIMPLE_BOGO_DIRENT_SIZE for every entry in the directory.

I got that one wrong! You can seek to the "sum of i_sizes (of the m 
directories) + offset" to access offset in the m'th directory/stack-depth.

It is counter-intuitive to have a value which is information less, like 
in the zero case.

This is how libc is reading directories (at least on arch s390x):
getdents() != 0
lseek() to d_off of last dirent
getdents() != 0
lseek() to d_off of last dirent
getdents() == 0
return
Therefore I really need values that make sense for d_off. Therefore I 
really need values that make (some kind of) sense for i_size.
