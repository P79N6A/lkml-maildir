Hi Song (added lkml to cc:).
You just need to have one common module usign all the sub-modules.
So having each sub-module in directory M/sub-a M/sub-b etc.
you need a makefile in M/ that looks like:
M/Makefile:
obj-m += sub-a/
obj-m += sub-b/
obj-m += mainmodule.o
In each sub-directory you need a separate Makefile like:
M/sub-a/Makefile
obj-m += a_sub_module.o
Then all symbols used by the mainmodule needs to be properly
exported in each sub-module.
Hope this clarifies it.
