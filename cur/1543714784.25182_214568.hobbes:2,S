Did you mean __devinit should be __devexit for cm_remove? Indeed, when I first change it, this question rose. There are still many other driver in kernel 2.4.25 use the same way. But I checked the driver in kernel 2.6 tree use the __devexit already for correct semantic meaning. I made following change, thanks for your correction.

There seem to be some bugs in the __{,dev}{init,exit} changes.
E.g. in the 2.6 patch:
  static void __devinit cm_remove(struct pci_dev *dev)
