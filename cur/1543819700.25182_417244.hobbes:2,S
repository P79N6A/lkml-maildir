Hi All,
I'm attempting to write a PCI device driver. I've read chapters 2, 9 and 
12 of the linux device driver book (3rd ed) and it got me going with the 
code below. However, I never see the message printed from cif50_probe, 
so appearantly the kernel doesn't consider my driver the correct driver 
for the hardware.
I tried to load the driver with insmod, but I also rebooted the system 
in the hope that some part of the kernel would find the hardware and try 
to load my driver. Is that how it is supposed to work? At least my 
driver is listed in /lib/modules/2.6.15.7/modules.pcimap. Modprobe 
doesn't find it, I don't know why. The hardware contains a PLX chip. The 
hardware is found by the kernel, as it correctly shows up in /proc/pci:
   Bus  1, device  13, function  0:
     Class 0680: PCI device 10b5:9050 (rev 1).
       IRQ 5.
       Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd1005000 [0xd100507f].
       I/O at 0xd100 [0xd17f].
       Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd1000000 [0xd1001fff].
Also in the corresponding /sys files.
Does anyone have a suggestion why my probe function is not being called?
TIA
Bert
