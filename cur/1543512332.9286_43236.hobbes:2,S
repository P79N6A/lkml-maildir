	I would suggest introducing kdev_t as a structure (and not as a pointer
	to a structure) for one reason --- it makes attempts to do any kind of
	mathematical or logical operations on a kdev_t painfully obvious.
Oh, Ted - you are usually such a sensible person.
We need a large struct with a lot of fields; one cannot go and pass
such a struct around as function parameter. It is out of the
question because of efficiency, but would also make the kernel
source incorrect C.
