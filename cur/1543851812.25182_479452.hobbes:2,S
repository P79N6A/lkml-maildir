Some users choose to use old drivers for the feeling of security and
reduction of change. Remember there are users out there who have to go
through a formal verification process to switch the driver they use.

This is not neccessarily misguided. They may want to do this.

Thats your problem. Some day the lawyers can find out just how legal
that is.
You are right that most users will want to use the AHCI layer and that
if AHCI is compiled in then we should switch to AHCI. In the case the
kernel has no AHCI support compiled in the legacy driver support should
continue to work for it. This is how other vendors products such as
Jmicron are handled.
NAK reasserted.
