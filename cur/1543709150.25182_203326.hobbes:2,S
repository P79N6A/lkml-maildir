Dear ,
Just a short note to let you know that I have a limited time special offer for
subscribers to Footprints. If you have been considering creating your own unique
gift of poetry, now would be a good time to take advantage of this offer. I'm not
sure how long I will keep this open for and it will definitely be first come -
first served! Full details can be found here:

Sincerely hope that I can be of service. Thanks again.
All the very best,
Allen Jesson
