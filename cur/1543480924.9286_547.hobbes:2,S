    I just got a 10.2 Gig Quantum HDD..
    I put it in my machine.. the bios finds it.. but linux only finds the size
    up to 8.6 or something
    What can I do to fix this? Do I have to give the lilo some options for the
    kernel or what?
1) Read the Large Disk HOWTO, especially the last section (on the Linux IDE
8 GB limit), and upgrade to a sufficiently recent kernel.
2) You can achieve all you want on old kernels by explicitly inventing
a geometry and telling the kernel, fdisk, LILO all about it, but that is
inconvenient and messy. Only to be recommended if 2.0.34 and 2.0.36 do
not work for you.
3) If things are still wrong then it is not Linux's fault -
I have seen broken BIOSes report very silly values for large
disks (my 17 GB disk is reported as 6 GB, for example),
and you can tell the kernel on the command line to ignore the BIOS values.
