It was originally done by Sebastian Kuzminsky. It basically uses the kernel's 
packet filter (BPF) and socket code, via Libnet and libpcap. You can get it 
from your friendly kernel.org mirror 
(
http://www.XX.kernel.org/pub/software/network/zcip/,
 where XX is your 
country code).
In the longer term, it might be appropriate to move some of it (the defend 
part of the claim-and-defend sequence) into kernel space. I don't think it 
makes sense to have it all in kernel space.
However since it is still an i-D, and hasn't reached RFC state, I think it is 
better to work up a reference implementation in userspace, and think about 
how much might need to be in the kernel (for performance reasons, whatever) 
when the RFC is released and we have a little deployment experience.
