All are self terminating, and are effected by the M:S:C jumpers for
their responses.  Things like leak current times and other events that are
based on various decay rates against an assumed Z value for a given
ribbon+devices+host combination will change things rudely.
There are issues of shadow registers and pattern responses.
But you got the swing of it!
