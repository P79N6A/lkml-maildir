Mostly "Inode XXX is in use, but has dtime set", some "Inode XXX has
compression flag set on filesystem without compression support", a
couple of "Inode XXX has illegal block(s)", which are followed by "Too
many illegal blocks in inode XXX" (AFAIU that forces the restart of pass
1).
I have a full typescript (1.4M) if you're interested.  The different
iterations of pass 1 are very similair but there are also differenctes.
I got tired after five iterations and just mkfs'ed it again.
This is starting to look more and more like a hardware problem.  The
next day I suddenly noticed that / and /var (both on /dev/hda) were
remounted read-only, probably because of errors.  That 140G LVM
partition was still rw.  An ls or grep would fail in any directory, but
some of the files could be accessed by their full path.  Trying to
access other files (even files in /proc) would result in I/O or Bus
error.  Actually, I'm only 90% sure about /proc -- could be it was
/usr/bin/less that was unreadable.  I was a bit excited at the time.
But I usually cat things in /proc, and I clearly remember that I could
successfully cat some files in /etc.
A reboot helped, but the syslog contained nothing interesting.  I ran
memtest for at least 20 hours -- it found no errors.  I think I already
mentioned that read-only badblock scan also found nothing.
BTW both /, /var and about 20GB part of LVM are on /dev/hda, which is an
40G IBM drive.  It might be pure superstition, but the words "IBM hard
drive" do not inspire much confidence to me.

It might be difficult to arrange at the moment, but I'll keep it in mind.

Ah, that's good to know.  Is there a kernel tree that supports DMA on
VP2?  I think I heard somewhere that the new IDE code did that, but I
wasn't paying much attention to its fate lately.
Thanks,
