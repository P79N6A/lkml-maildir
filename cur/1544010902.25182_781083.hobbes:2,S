Ingo pointed out that this generates build crap in ftrace which made me
look at the thing again, and I just realized we don't need it.
trace_sched_wakeup() gets called before we set p->state = TASK_RUNNING,
so by checking p->state in the callback we can see if its a real of
false wakeup.
The scheduler tracer in ftrace already exploits this.
