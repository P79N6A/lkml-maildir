I might add that Microsoft didn't invent the 
database-in-the-operating-system concept -- IBM has had that concept for 
years with the AS-400 line.  Indeed, the announcement by Microsoft sounds 
like MS is really courting the business marketplace; perhaps it is willing 
to give up some markets to go after what it may view as its core 
customers.  How many science/engineer types willingly use Windows as other 
than a window (pardon the pun) to a Unix-type system and as an 
office-productivity tool?
One way Microsoft could "beat Linux" is to bolster its integration with 
business mainframes, providing data layering tools designed for business 
applications "out of the box" -- a task that Linux itself (the operating 
system) could never, and should never, do.  If some company or group wants 
to put in the skull sweat and build a distribution that would do the deed, 
with kernel mods and userland support, more power to them.
