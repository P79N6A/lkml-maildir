Use the Linux native driver for hpt374.  It works fine for me with
2.6.0.  I'm running software RAID on four disks with no problems so
far (uptime nearly 6 days, that's when I installed 2.6.0).

The Highpoint driver is one of the ugliest pieces of code I've seen.
I'm surprised it works at all.  Don't go near it if you wish to keep
your sanity.
There have been scattered reports of trouble with the hpt374 chip
lately, so maybe I have been lucky.  I'd still suggest that you give
it a try.
