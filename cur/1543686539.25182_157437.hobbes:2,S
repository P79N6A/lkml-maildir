My apologies, I meant to.  Somehow I got Pavel Macheck instead of
Patrick Mochel.   The names are only superficially similar but mistakes
happen.

Assuming the device driver can get a device out of the suspend state
when the module is loaded.  This has been one of the biggest problem areas
with the e100 driver.  It's init code cannot bring the device out of a low
power state.

Possibly.  But this is getting complicated.  And while I do support things
being complicated enough to handle the problem this part of the API feels
like it is excessively complicated.  Which is why I was trying to simply
it by always calling shutdown on a device before we remove it.
