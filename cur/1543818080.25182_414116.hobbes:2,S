I found the root cause, but don't know if its worth fixing.  If the board has more than
32 PCI busses on it, the mptable bus array will overwrite its bounds for the PCI busses,
and stomp on anything that's after it.  In this case, what got stomped on is the PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC
variable, which changed the bit-field settings for the page tables (cleared the 'present' bit,
and screwed up the rest), hence accounting for the page fault.
This can only happen if there are more than 32 PCI busses, so I'd say its an _extremely_ rare
condition on a desktop system.  At any rate, the fix would simply be to change the value of the
#define in the mptable.h header file (I forget which exactly, but its easy to find) from 32 to 256.
The side effect of that is that the kernel data area would grow, and mostly be a total waste,
since I can't fathom a desktop system with more than 32 PCI busses.  On arch's where more than
32 PCI busses are likely, the #define is already 256.
One thing to take away from all this is that runtime memory corruption can change the PAGE_KERNEL
and PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC values, causing bogus page faults, followed by oops's.  Usually a buggy
driver or module might cause this, and throw off whoever is trying to debug it from the original cause
of the error.  I'll at least double-check if the PAGE_KERNEL* vars. are still sane after any oops relating
to paging.  Might save me some time...
Thanks for everybody's input and patience.
