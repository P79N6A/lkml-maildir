Not necessary.  pci_devs are allocated initialised to 0.

This seems like the wrong place to be setting the pci_drvdata.  It
should probably be done in each driver.  But then, requesting the IRQ
should also be done by each driver.  You've dragged us into the "wow,
what a mess DRI is" black hole here, I'm afraid.
