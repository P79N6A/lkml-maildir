These symbols don't exist in what context?
The one I notice:
-# CONFIG_CPUSETS is not set
certainly exists, in init/Kconfig:
    config CPUSETS
	bool "Cpuset support"
	depends on SMP && CGROUPS
and is enabled by default in some configs:
    arch/ia64/configs/sn2_defconfig
    arch/mips/configs/ip27_defconfig
    arch/mips/configs/sb1250-swarm_defconfig
    arch/powerpc/configs/cell_defconfig
    arch/powerpc/configs/ppc64_defconfig
    arch/powerpc/configspseries_defconfig
I could be tempted to enable cpusets by default in x86_64
as well, however I don't understand the tradeoffs of such
a change well enough to know if I should propose that.
