It's capable(CAP_IPC_LOCK) || in_group_p(0), not current->uid == 0.
It will barf if you ask for more than either one of those limits. It
will also barf if you ask for an amount not a multiple of the hugepage
size. Please show the test program's code and strace the test program
to determine what response it's getting.
