What do you think of disabling negative dentry caching entirely
when acregmin is set to zero? Other UNIXes don't cache them at all,
at least not by default:
	OSF1 V4.0 alpha	(NFS v3)
	SunOS 4.x
	Solaris 5.5.2	(NFS v3)
	Solaris 5.7	(NFS v3)
	Ultrix 4.4 RISC
	HP-UX B.10.20
(just tested, no special mount options)
I think it's trivial to implement.
