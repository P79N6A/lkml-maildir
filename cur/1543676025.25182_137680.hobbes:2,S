Hi all...
Any body knows if this still applies:
kernel/Makefile
ifneq ($(CONFIG_IA64),y)
# According to Alan Modra <alan@linuxcare.com.au>, the -fno-omit-frame-pointer is
# needed for x86 only.  Why this used to be enabled for all architectures is beyond
# me.  I suspect most platforms don't need this, but until we know that for sure
# I turn this off for IA-64 only.  Andreas Schwab says it's also needed on m68k
# to get a correct value for the wait-channel (WCHAN in ps). --davidm
CFLAGS_sched.o := $(PROFILING) -fno-omit-frame-pointer
endif
