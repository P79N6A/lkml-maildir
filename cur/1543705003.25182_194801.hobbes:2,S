Hi!
I am writing a driver for an usb microcontroller (ezusb), which will be
used for measuring and controlling. I am confused on which interface to
use though. The driver is for kernel 2.6.x. 
I want to send small (human readable) commends as well as data (e.g.
firmware) to the device. Which filesystem is appropriate?
regards
Jonas
