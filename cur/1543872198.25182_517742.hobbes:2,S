The difficulty is that there are 4 different formats of signal structure
you could get: (traditional|siginfo) x (32bit|64bit).
What happens if you're a 32 bit process, you fork and exec a 64bit
process who inherits the signalfd, and they start reading?  What format
of signal structure do they get?  What do you get?  What if you start
doing partial reads?
I think signalfd_dequeue() is warty, but read() has has a number of
details to sort out.
(Hey, can you send signals by writing into the signalfd?  Very plan9...)
