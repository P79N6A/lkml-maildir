Ah, maybe it's better.
I met several memory troubles in user's systems in these days. (on older kernels)
Thousands/hundreds of process works on it.
When I explain the cutomers about memory management, I devides memory into..
(1) unused memory  --- memory which is not used, in free-list of zones.
(2) reclaimable memory --- page cache, which is reclaimable
	clean pages  --- can be reclaimed soon
	dirty pages  --- need to be written back
	*BUT* busy pages are unreclaimable. 
(3) swappable memory --- user process's pages. basically reclaimable if 
                         swap is available.
			 shmem pages are included here.
(4) locked memory --- mlocked memory, which is not reclaimable(but movable)
(5) kernel memory --- used by kernel, 
                      (and we can't see how many pages are reclaimable)
We can know the amount of (1) and (5) and total memory.
Basically, (3) = (Total) - (2) - (1).
busy data-set of (2)(3) is not reclaimable. but the amount of busy data-set
is unknown. Many users takes log of 'ps' or 'sar' to estimate their memory
usage. (and sometimes page-cache of 'log-file' eats their memory.....)
The amount of (4) is unknown. But there was a system with 6GB of 8GB
memory was mlocked (--; and OOM works.
I'm sorry that I can't catch up how the current kernel can show memory usage.
I should investigate that. 
FYI:
Because some customers are migrated from mainframes, they want to control
almost all features in OS, IOW, designing memory usages.
