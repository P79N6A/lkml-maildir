I am trying to use a XE2000 (Xircom 10/100 Network PC Card) in an older Dell
Latitude. The card comes up and does appear to be healthy that the link
light is always red and I can't see any traffic. I've never seen this card
work so I don't know if the link light color indicates a problem. About once
a minute, I see:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: tranmit timed out
eth0: media 10BaseT, silicon 4
(typed that in by hand)
The switch on the other end (Catalyst 2924) shows a normal 100bT fulldup
link light.  Running "tcpdump ether host $laptop_mac" from another host
shows nothing.
I am running 2.4.17, debian woody, pcmcia-cs 2.1.31-6.
