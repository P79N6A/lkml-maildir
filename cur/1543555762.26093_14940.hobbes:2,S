I would suggest you to read through the following book and files:
	* Kernighan & Pike, "The Practice of Programming"
	* Documentation/CodingStyle
	* drivers/net/aironet4500_proc.c
and consider, erm, discrepancies. On the second thought, reading K&R
might also be useful. IOW, no offense, but your C is bad beyond belief.
