Yup, I see it too, it looks like it's just that fbcon doesn't clear the 
backing store when it does a resolution switch, so when the bootup process 
switches from the original VGA 80x25 text mode into 200x75 or whatever, it 
has random garbage in the new area.
It scrolls away, so it's a beauty wart at worst. I haven't bothered to 
look into where the missing clear is. Hint hint.

This is due to the issue that I and BenH discussed on the kernel mailing 
list under the subject 
	2.6.3-rc3 radeonfb: Problems with new (and old) driver
where radeonfb doesn't even get the callback to reset the graphics engine,
so when X has changed some of the engine setup, radeonfb does the wrong 
thing afterwards. BenH already posted a patch, but I complained about how 
ugly it was ;)
So this will get fixed, but it almost certainly won't be fixed by 2.6.3.
