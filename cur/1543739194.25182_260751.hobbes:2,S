Please: one point of per-cpu vars is that archs can choose to hold the
per-cpu offset in a reg, and derive smp_processor_id() from that.  By
doing the reverse, manually, you defeat this.  How about:
	int *flip = __get_cpu_var(cpu_profile_flip);
	*flip = !*flip;

Similarly, this is equivalent to:
	j = __get_cpu_var(cpu_profile_flip);
Cheers,
Rusty.
