Yes - that is exactly what I'm suggesting. If the
agreement is the same but the name of the agreement
changes I don't think you would have that much of a
transition. GPL2=LKL. But the confusion created by FSF
would go away.
If Linux is staying with GPL2 then this would signal
to the world that there's a fork and that Linux is
going in a different direction.
