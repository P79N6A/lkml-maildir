Agreed. And thanks for ignoring the obvious typo.

No doubt. However, GPLv2 actually states in clear and concise english that it 
doesn't cover *anything* but the rights to "copy, distribute and modify" 
covered works. It actually states that other rights are beyond the scope of 
the license. That statement, IMHO (and IANAL), obviates any other "intent" 
the "inventor" of the license may have had by making the scope of the license 
clear.

I own an XBox 360. If it breaks I can't fix it without the cooperation of MS. 
The fact that a TiVO runs an OS that is licensed under the GPL doesn't change 
the fact that the situation is *exactly* the same. TiVO breaks? Manufacturer 
(or someone certified and licensed for the task by the manu) fixes it. XBox 
breaks? Manufacturer fixes it. My laptop breaks? As long as its under 
warranty, the manufacturer fixes it *FOR* *FREE* - if it's out of warranty, I 
pay for the "service" but they still fix it. QED: The "manufacturer must 
cooperate in or perform the repair" is not some new idea - its actually 
common practice.

It might be that you are correct. However, thanks to someone having actually 
identified the exact scope of the GPLv2 *in* the legally active text of the 
license the "intent" shouldn't have much weight or bearing. Look at the first 
sentence of the second paragraph of section 0. "Activities other than 
copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they 
are outside its scope."

And I happen to agree with you. What I disagree with is taking steps to 
make "bad == illegal". I also have a problem with doing things that force my 
viewpoint on other people.

And neither am I. My whole point in arguing over it has been that, despite 
what some people want to believe, it isn't violating the GPLv2 in any way, 
shape or form.

Thank you for that.

Yes, you have.
