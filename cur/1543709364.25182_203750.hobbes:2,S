The very great problems that exist with poll on linux-2.6.0
are being quashed by those who just like to argue. Therefore,
I wrote some code that emulates the environment in which I
discovered the poll failure. Experts can decide whatever they
want about the inner workings of poll(). I supposed that if
`ps` showed that a task was sleeping in poll() then it must
be sleeping in poll(). So, even it that's wrong, here is
irrefutable proof that there is a problem with polling events
getting lost on 2.6.0. The attached code will execute without
errors in 2.4.24 and below.
Here is the test code running on Linux-2.4.24

This ran for about 1/2 hour ( 10:24 -> 11:05) with no

This is the same thing, running on this exact same machine, booted with

It ran from 13:00 to 13:04, accumulating 78 errors.
A review of the test code shows that the driver uses IRQ8
from the RTC timer chip. The driver doesn't care if some
interrupt ticks are lost because it just increments a memory
variable every time that an interrupt occurs. After that variable
is incremented, the interrupt service routine sets a global
flag to POLLIN and sends a wake_up_interruptible() to whomever
is sleeping in poll(). Spin-locks are put around critical
sections to prevent undefined results.
In the user-mode code, the task sleeping in poll() reads
the variable using read(). The user-mode code doesn't
care what the value is, only that it must be one-greater than
the last one read. If it isn't, an error message is written
to standard error.
Observations:
If the call to mlockall() is removed in the test-code, the
behavior seems to be better, just the opposite of what one
would suspect.
The priority (nice value) doesn't seem to affect anything.
The code runs without any errors on 2.4.24, 2.4.22, 2.4.21, and
2.4.18. The only source I have on this machine for 2.6.x is
for 2.6.0-test8.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
