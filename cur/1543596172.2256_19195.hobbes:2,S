Case 1:
	You pass a single cookie to the readb code
	Odd platforms decode it
Case 2:
	You carry around bus number information all throughout
		each driver
	You keep putting it on/off the stack
	You keep it in structures
	You do complex generic locking for hotplug 'just in case'
I think I prefer case 1.
