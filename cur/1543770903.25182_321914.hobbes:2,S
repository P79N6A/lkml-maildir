A single node must be big enough to support sane load balancing; ie, big
enough to run at least one (or more) "whole" resource entities / jobs.
That is the breaking point after which it is more sensible to deploy
more nodes - with looser coupling - than making a single node / SSI
component larger, because decoupled operation means less complexity for
fault isolation.
