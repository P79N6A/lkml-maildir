i think EMBEDDED is justified in this particular case, as enabling 
CONFIG_PROCESSOR_SELECT allows you to create truly CPU-incompatible 
kernels. Kernels that panic on bootup on contemporary CPUs that happen to 
have a different manufacturer.
The normal CPU selection options (like CONFIG_MCORE2) are more like 
performance and preference hints not hard constraints - those kernels will 
generally still boot fine on most other CPUs as well. (with a few 
common-sense exceptions like booting on truly ancient CPUs, i.e. booting 
an CONFIG_MCORE2 kernel on an i486DX CPU will not work)
