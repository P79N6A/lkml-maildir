I fully agree these problems need to be fixed. I just wish I
had the time to tackle all of them right now ;)
We should be close to getting the 3rd problem fixed and the
deadlock problem with the bounce buffers seems to be fixed
already.
Getting reclaiming of swap space and OOM fixed is a matter
of time ... I hope I'll have that time in the near future.
