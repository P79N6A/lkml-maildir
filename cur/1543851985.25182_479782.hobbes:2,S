s390: need definitions for pagefault_disable and pagefault_enable
Seems that when the changes for user futex's went into 2.6.19-rc4-mm2
s390 was missed.  Leading to the following compile failure:
    arch/s390/lib/lib.a(uaccess_std.o)(.text+0x37c): In function
						    `futex_atomic_op':
    : undefined reference to `pagefault_disable'
    arch/s390/lib/lib.a(uaccess_std.o)(.text+0x3cc): In function
						    `futex_atomic_op':
    : undefined reference to `pagefault_enable'
    [...]
This seems to be enough to get testing working again.
