Test code with constant test patterns tend to miss the corner case
bugs, while random pattern test cases hit them assumed that there is a
broad enough tester base. 
It's a question of how you write such test code to achieve
reproducability. It's not rocket science to track the variables of a
test run and print them along with the printk, when a wrong state is
detected. That way you can inject them for reproduction.

Well, I agree that you did not intend to code it that way, but calling
it a subtle bug, which needs to be fixed for .25, is just misleading.

Exactly. Again it's not a subtle bug. It's useless code which does no
harm at all. We can safely dispose that in .26.
