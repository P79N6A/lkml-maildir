However, practically, cardbus have always had and continue to have their
resources setup prior to driver probe.

Nevertheless, my basic point that the no_ioport solution only addresses
one problem area, while being far too late for the other methods still
stands.
Maybe the setup-* stuff needs to be rewritten (in which case cardbus
will also convert to the "new" system automatically)?
Given the problems of allocating resources for bridges inside cardbus
cards, it would be nice if this could happen, so the limited IO range
provided to cardbus could be more efficiently (and selectively) used.
Wouldn't you think that's a sane idea?
