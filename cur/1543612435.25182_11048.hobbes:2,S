Yeah, there is already support for mapping in a random file and using that
as UML memory, so that would be used for the cluster interconnect for any
cluster emulations you wanted to run with UML.

No, at least not any shared memory that's not already there.  UML uses a 
host process for each UML process, and UML kernel data and text are
shared between all these host processes.  SMP just means having more than
one host process runnable at a time.  Each runnable process on the host
is a virtual processor.

It doesn't yet.  Someone is (or was), but I haven't heard a peep from him in
at least a month.  So this is starting to look like another little project
which got quickly going but just as quickly abandoned.
