Thought of that. What does the initial mounting of / ? If it's using /etc/fstab
then that isn't the problem - I have no partitions mounting noexec.
/bin and /lib are on the / partition. If it's a script then it's from Mandrake
and I'll have to hunt it down and send them a patch.
Not using devfs or udev. No initrd. All components built-in although module
support is enabled.
/etc/fstab is included below.
