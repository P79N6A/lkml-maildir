Why?  Hardware semaphores are notorious for causing hangs.  Nobody is 
sharing the hardware under Linux, so I think we should enable access on 
init, and not disable access until driver close.  IMO the mixer should 
be guarded by a Linux kernel semaphore...  I have a patch from Thomas 
Sailer (I think) lying around somewhere that does just that to the via 
audio driver.  Maybe we can adapt it.
(I cc'd this little detail, in my ali/trident.c patch review, to you)
