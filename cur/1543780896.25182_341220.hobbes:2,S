Mine does too.  Asus A8V Deluxe.  No problems so far.  Everything on the
board I have tried just works.
Can't say my A7N8X-E Deluxe has any real issues either.  I may only get
ac97 audio level out of the nifty DSP, but I hardly use sound on the
system anyhow, so I don't mind.  forcedeth driver works for networking,
sil3112a sata works with WD drives no problem, nvidia ide controller
seems to work fine with dvd drives, firewire works, yukon sk98lin works
too, usb is fine.  No complaints from me.
