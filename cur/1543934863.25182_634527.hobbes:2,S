It failed at 0325 GMT thanks to the many of you who played, but 
unfortunately it was an assert somewhere unrelated that failed.  I'll 
start it up again shortly.

That's the one!  At the time it was the only game that worked with my 
VT100-to-HTML conversion.

Yes.

It's all here:  
https://svn.chezphil.org/anyterm/trunk/daemon/
In particular:  
https://svn.chezphil.org/libpbe/trunk/src/Daemon.cc
However, there's a lot of code and I know that there are bugs in it.  I 
just want to focus on the kernel-related issue that the strace fragment 
that I posted brings up:  even if my user code gets completely screwed 
up (corrupts its stack, runs out of FDs/VM/threads etc), I don't think 
that I should see in the strace output that accept() has returned 
ERESTARTSYS.  I should always see accept() returning a legitimate 
result before seeing that thread doing the next syscall.  Right?
Cheers,  Phil.
