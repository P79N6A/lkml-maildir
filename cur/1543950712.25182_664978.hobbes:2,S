I think it wouldn't be that difficult for the normal anonymous user allocations
(standard page fault path), but doing it for everything would be pretty
hard because you would need to add signal-bail-out paths everywhere. 
But doing it for some simple cases like page fault only would be a nice 
project for someone, shouldn't be too difficult.
