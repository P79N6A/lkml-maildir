commit 58b3b71dfaaecbf7cff1fe10c049d663f0313e5f

    Fix ThinkPad T42 poweroff failure introduced by by "PM: Introduce 
pm_power_off_prepare"
    Commit bd804eba1c8597cbb7cd5a5f9fe886aae16a079a ("PM: Introduce
    pm_power_off_prepare") caused problems in the poweroff path, as reported 
by
    YOSHIFUJI Hideaki / åè¤è±æ.
    Generally, sysdev_shutdown() should be called after the ACPI preparation 
for
    powering the system off.  To make it happen, we can separate 
sysdev_shutdown()
    from device_shutdown() and call it directly wherever necessary.
