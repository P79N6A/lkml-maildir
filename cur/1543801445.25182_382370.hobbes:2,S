I've put a lot of effort into reducing code duplication and reducing the 
size of the interface and making it completely orthogonal to load 
balancing so I'm hopeful (perhaps mistakenly) that this makes it more 
acceptable (at least in -mm).
My testing shows that there's no observable difference in performance 
between a stock kernel and plugsched with ingosched selected at the 
total system level (although micro benchmarking may show slight 
increases in individual operations).
Anyway, I'll just keep plugging away,
Peter
