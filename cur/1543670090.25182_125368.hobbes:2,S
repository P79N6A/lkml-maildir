I have a (fairly large) request: 
Would you mind updating Documentation/swsusp.txt (and moving it to 
Documentation/power/swsusp.txt)? 
This will accomplish a few things:
- Make the documentation readable.
- Explain exactly how swsusp works internally.
- Explain how to use it.
- Explain what the current dependencies and bugs are. 
- Explain what the cryptic debug values above are. 
Frankly, the code is a mess and difficult to follow. It's also poorly
commented. I spent the time about a month ago unwinding and deciphering 
it. Unfortunately, my work conflicts heavily with the work that you're 
doing, and the lack of documentation describing the intent of the code 
makes it difficult to make sane judgements of it. 
Thanks,
