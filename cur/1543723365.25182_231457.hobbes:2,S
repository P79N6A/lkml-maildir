I agree.  I don't know if it would work out to be a net gain on
average or a net loss.
It saves a couple of instructions, but when it fails the cost is only
a few instructions anyway.
Probably for get_user & put_user, the common case _is_ to be on the
user's stack, so Russell's code would be better.
