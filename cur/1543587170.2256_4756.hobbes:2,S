Re-entrancy is only prevented by holding the io-request lock or in
some cases a per-controller or per-controller driver lock.
As the comment in scsi_unblock_requests() states, this API assumes
that no locks are held.  If you hold a lock in calling this routine,
you may deadlock.

I suppose a poorly implemented use of this API could tail recurse.
The aic7xxx driver calls this routine from a timeout handler so
there is no risk of stack explosion.

Well, the patch was written to have minimal impact to an API that
has never been used.  A more correct solution might be to queue the
affected host controller to a queue drained by a bottom-half handler.
