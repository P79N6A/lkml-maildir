Subject: BUG [2.6.9-rc4] tmpfs is mountable even when not configured but non-functional

I don't have tmpfs configured into my kernel
# CONFIG_TMPFS is not set
but I can still mount tmpfs, so mount -t tmpfs none /dev/shm works and I
get in the output of mount:
...
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
...
when I try ls on that directory I get:
ls: /dev/shm/: Not a directory
