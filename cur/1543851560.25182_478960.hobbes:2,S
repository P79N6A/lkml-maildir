Okay... So I have cellphone here, 700mAh battery, ~2.8Wh battery. It
could last 14 days if we were *very* careful. 
echo '(700 mA * hour) / (14*day) \ A' | ucalc
ucalc> OK:  0.002083
ucalc>
...that is about 2mA in low power standby mode (but still listening on
GSM, getting calls, etc).
...so, mAh are probably good enough for capacity_*_charge, but would
suck for current power consumption, as difference between 2mA and 3mA
would be way too big. We need some finer unit in that case.
