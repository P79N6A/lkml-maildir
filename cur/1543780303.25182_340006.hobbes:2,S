Doesn't that require 16 pages per CPU?  That seems excessive to impose 
on a native build.  Perhaps we could get away with 1 page per CPU for 
the GDT on native boots and bump that up to 16 if compiling for a 
virtualized sub-architecture - i.e. move GDT to a page aligned struct 
for native (doesn't cost too much), and give it MACH_GDT_PAGES of space 
which is defined by the sub-architecture.
Let's take this thread over to virtualization@lists.osdl.org as well.
