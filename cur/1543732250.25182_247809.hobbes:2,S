Once ATAPI is complete, then I will green-light PATA support in libata.
Since libata already supports the standard bmdma stuff, and can even 
work in PIO-only mode without DMA (or even without interrupts, in 100% 
polling mode), it is definitely possible to drive the hardware.
If you want to play, and don't care about lack of ATAPI support (i.e. 
just disks), then it is possible today to do this.  #define 
ATA_FORCE_PIO and play away :)
With regards to libata being the default, making that an _option_ is 
feasible, but we will probably default to the IDE driver for quite some 
time.  There are issues of /dev/hda versus /dev/sda, keeping existing 
user setups working, etc.
