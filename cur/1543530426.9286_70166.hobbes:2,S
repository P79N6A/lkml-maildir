Well, the kernel's definition is:
free = (buffermem >> PAGE_SHIFT) + (page_cache_size + nr_free_pages +
	nr_swap_pages) - (page_cache.min_percent + buffer_mem.min_percent
	+2)*num_physpages/100;
It then returns (free > pages), where pages was the number of pages
requested. (If sysctl_overcommit_memory is non-zero, it ALWAYS returns 1,
bypassing the above checks.)
In other words, it works out (roughly) how much VM is "available", and
checks whether you have requested less than that amount.

Close - but it's not the TOTAL RAM+swap, it's the FREE RAM+swap. Your
experiment indicated you had managed to malloc() more than this, though,
even with sysctl_overcommit_memory == 0?
