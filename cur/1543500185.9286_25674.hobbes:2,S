It's not neccessary for compatibility and other important things that the
dir command counts directory space in the same way. It's a question of
personal taste wether you want to see the actual space used or the actual
space occupied by a directory entry. In any case the space is allocated in
blocks, so even on SunOS a directory is allocated in blocks of special
size.
