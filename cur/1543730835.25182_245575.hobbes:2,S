  Yes, JPEG, TIFF and PNG files for example. But, if you modify any of
  these  with  an application that doesn't support the extensions then
  you will loose them.
  Also,  you  are thinking _very_ narrowly now. There are thousands of
  file  formats.  Implementing  the  support  for  meta-data/ streams/
  attributes  in  the  kernel  will  make  it  possible  to  use  this
  generically for all files.
  I  use  this  in  Windows  quite much. I put information description
  fields  for  lots  of  different  files. These descriptions are then
  searchable etc. I could use the command prompt to copy the files and
  the descriptions would still be there.
  Secondly, do you expect file managers like Nautilus and Konqueror to
  support  every piece of file format on the planet so they could read
  information directly from the documents?
