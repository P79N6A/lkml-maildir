What I have been doing is now recorded as bug #3997 at
  
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3997
Running latencytest has the advantage of generating some charts
that I can show others how well (or poorly) the system runs.
I just rebooted in SMP and did a few other tests with the following
steps that should be simpler to set up and run.
[1] Create cpu_test.c as follows:
#define LOOPS 100000000
int main() {
  int u, v, k, l;
  for (v=0; v<100; v++) {
    for (u=0; u<LOOPS; u++) {
      k += 1;
      if (!(u%100)) {
      l += 1;
      k = 0;
      }
    }
  }
  return k;
}
On my 866 Mhz Pentium III, it runs for about 3 minutes, 45 seconds.
Adjust the outer loop in the code if you need to run shorter or
longer. I would not run more than 5 minutes - you should easily
get the symptom before then. This also puts a limit of how long
you have to wait if the system gets "stuck" and does not respond
to your keyboard or mouse.
[2] Build the application
  gcc -o cpu_test cpu_test.c
[3] On a two CPU system (or repeat this step N-1 times for
your N cpu system). Run in a separate window...
  chrt -f 10 ./cpu_test
[4] In a separate window...
  nice ./cpu_test
At this point, you should have the system 100% utilized with N-1
real time applications & 1 nice application. I used top to confirm
this result.
[5] In a separate window do one or more of the following:
  a. head -c $1 /dev/zero >tmpfile
  (replacing $1 with about 1.5x your physical memory size
   - this is my "disk write" test)
  b. cp tmpfile tmpfile2
  (this is my "disk copy" test)
  c. cat tmpfile tmpfile2 >/dev/null
  (this is my "disk read" test)
delete the files when done.
It appears (at least on my system) that disk I/O triggers the
problem more than the other tests (x11perf, top [with no delay]).
I was however in an odd situation [just before I sent this message]
where it appeared that the disk copy was OK but I could not
type on any of my windows - mouse entries were OK but not the
keyboard. That may be a different variant of my "starvation
problem".
