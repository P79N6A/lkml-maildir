Hi.  I was reading the readme in the 2.4.0-test2 kernel documentation
tree for defs when I ran into the following mysterious passage
/etc/securetty
PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is supposed to be a flexible
mechanism for providing better user authentication and access to
services. Unfortunately, it's also fragile, complex and undocumented
(check out RedHat 6.1, and probably other distributions as well). PAM
has problems with symbolic links. Append the following lines to your
/etc/securetty file:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
What does this mean since /etc/security is a directory and where
shhould these lines go anyway?
Any assistance would be appreciated.
