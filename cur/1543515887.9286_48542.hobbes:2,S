DOS doesn't know (nor does it care) about time zones; it assumes,
that your computer's clock keeps local time and this is the only
time it deals with. So the time stamps on a file system written by
DOS normally contain the date/time in the local time (possibly
plus DST) at the time they have been written.
When such a file system is read under linux, it is reasonable to
assume that the files have been written in the same time zone
that is currently in effect - as far as I can tell this is also
the assumption behind the code in fs/fat/misc.c that I quoted.
The problem is, that the timestamps are converted back and forth
between local time and Unix time and that only for *some* dates
you get the original timestamp back...
