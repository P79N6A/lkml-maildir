Yes, useful little thing. Thanks, I wasn't aware of it.

No, all errors will result in next iteration of this loop. Anyway this 
function should be rewritten. Once I figure out how to do the correct 
register stuff for SCSI drivers I'll port this over to Linux 2.6 driver 
model. Then this loop will go away.

*g* I've done such patches more than once ;)

I read that, yes. But I had reasons not to CC him. This change is more or less 
to prevent others touching this file ;)

P.S.: your host is listed in cbl.abuseat.org. You should go and check this. 
Either you have a dynamic IP used by someone dumb before (than you have to 
ask them for delisting) or you probably have some sort of security hole.
