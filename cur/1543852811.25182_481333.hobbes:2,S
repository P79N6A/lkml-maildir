In my understanding , from drivers/acpi/numa.c, 
a node is created by a pxm found in SRAT table at boot time.
the node-number for the pxm which was not found in SRAT at boot time is "-1".
please check how acpi_map_pxm_to_node() is used.
If pci's node-id is based on pxm, checking return vaule of pxm_to_node() 
will be good.
