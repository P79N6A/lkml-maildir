how does it perform compared to elevator-lowlatency? I guess this is a
call for Con to run a pass on it.
Actually I still think the 32M queue on a 32M scsi machine during
contigous writes where the elevator basically doesn't matter is a
""bit"" overkill so I still like elevator-lowlatency somehow. 
elevator-lowlatency could do something smarter than it currently does
though.
