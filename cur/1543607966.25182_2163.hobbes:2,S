I believe that at least some SVR4 systems allow you to set lbolt, either
during runtime or at boot.
You have to be able to do that to test things.  Like drivers (last I check,
NCR still crashes upon wrap around), or utilities that monitor the uptime
so they can remind you that a reboot is necessary soon (so that you don't
crash).
