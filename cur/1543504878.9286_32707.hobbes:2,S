OK, here's my review:
  1. In alloc_groups_struct() you make an unchecked memory allocation
     (either a kmalloc, __get_free_page, or vmalloc).  You do
     correctly check for a NULL return in sys_setgroups, but not
     before alloc_groups_struct() has already stepped on the NULL.
  2. In free_groups_struct() you compute "size" based on:
       size = sizeof(struct groups_struct) + gs->ngroups * sizeof(gid_t);
     I think you mean gs->max_ngroups there.  The way you have it now
     the memory could be freed using a different method than it was
     allocated from if a process setgroups() a huge list and then
     later shrank the list to just a few entries.
  3. When you allocate superhuge lists of groups (i.e. with vmalloc)
     you might as well round up max_ngroups to just fit into that
     many PAGE_SIZE's.  This would greatly benefit the case of
     incrementally adding more groups to a large list.
  4. Why allow ->sec_groups to be NULL?  Instead why not make a
     special groups_struct to reflect that:
       struct groups_struct empty_groups_struct = { 1, 0, 0 };
     This would remove a lot of checks against NULL in your code and
     may speed up in_groups (it adds a cache-hit memory read in the
     case of sec_groups being empty and needing to be consulted, but
     that shouldn't be common case; it saves a branch in the more
     common case)
     The only two concrens I can see are:
       * you might need to do something fancier to initialize the atomic_t -
	 I'm sure there's some macro for initializing atomic's in
	 static initializers.
       * the atomic increment and decrement of empty_groups_stuct.count may
	 cause that cache line to bounce between processors on SMP boxes
	 under very heavy process creation load.  If that's a concern then
	 just add a check for gs==&free_groups_struct in fork and
	 free_groups_struct() and don't do the increment/decrement.
	 Note that in this case empty_groups_struct.count should be
	 initialized to something other than 1 so that sys_setgroups()
	 doesn't try to grab it.

Basically, you need to make sure that by the time you increment ->count
that we are sure to go through release() and vice versa.  I'm not
100% sure you have that right, but I'm not convinced it's definately
wrong either.  I don't have a copy of .12 handy to check at the moment.
