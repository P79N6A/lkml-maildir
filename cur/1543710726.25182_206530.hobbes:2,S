Depends on who you ask, but imo it boils down to this:
- Use one filesystem as backing store, usually ro.
- Have another filesystem on top for extra functionality, usually rw
  access.
Famous example is a rw-CDROM, where writes go to hard drive and
unchanged data is read from CDROM.  But it makes sense for other
things as well.
