Personally, I like this patch very much. Not only it fixes the bug,
in my opinion it also makes the code more clean.
However at first glance it has a minor fixable problem,

If type != PIDTYPE_PID we can't trust p->pids[type].pid unless p is a
group leader. This .pid could be just a "random value".
