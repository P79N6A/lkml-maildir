This belongs into drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c, not here!
Subsequent keypresses are already ignored - autorepeat is done in
software, however if you get a very quick press-release-press of the
same key that means the keyboard controller didn't do proper debouncing
and you probably can ignore the later release and press. But you must
ignore the release as well. Further - comparing to 10 jiffies isn't a
good idea - jiffies speed is different on different archs.
