I recently wrote a document on the different kernel trees and how to
apply patches for them. In that document I also give a description of
the various trees.
Perhaps that document will be useful to you. You can find it in a
recent kernel source tree as Documentation/applying-patches.txt or you
can read it online via lrx at this URL :
http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/Documentation/applying-patches.txt
Good luck on your article. Once you are done with it I'd love to read
it and I guess a lot of other people would too, so please supply an
URL to it at that time :-)
