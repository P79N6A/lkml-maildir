I had two problems. Once the second problem was resolved, pulling
usbkbd from the picture made operation more consistent between
directly-plugged and KVM-switched keyboards.
For the second problem, the uhci driver changed names from 2.4 to
2.6. If others google(v) for this problem and find this post, you want
the module "uhci_hcd" and not "usb-uhci" when going from 2.4 to 2.6
The original USB loader daemon I was using recognized the change, but
the second I had tried and was still using did not. I've sent notes to
ask Documentation/input/input.txt to be updated, and I've filed a bug
against the second daemon.
Thanks for the help!
