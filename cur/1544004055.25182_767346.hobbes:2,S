IMHO the server or driver shouldn't do anything with the event but pass it on
to the client. What the events then mean semantically depends on the client
(or the toolkit). This replicates pretty much what we do with mouse events and
although it puts the burden on the client side to do anything useful, it makes
it easier to develop, debug and also to do non-standard interpretation of
gestures.
The X server's job is basically just to pick the right client to send the
events to, and of course augment the events with X specific data (such as the
window).
