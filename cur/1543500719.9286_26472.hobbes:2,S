I have used APM on both desktops and laptops and all suffer the same
anoying feature:
after a susspend the sound card has to be re initialised ie modules un
loaded and re loaded
This is infuriating with enlightenment as esd stops the sound modules
from being unloaded until it is killed and after restarting it (esd)
all programs that were connected to it eg enlightenment also have to be
restarted.
Is there a workaround for this?
