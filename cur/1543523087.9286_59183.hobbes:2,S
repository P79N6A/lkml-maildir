Could anybody point me at the details of this fix from AA (See Below) - I
can't find it on the list.
I am trying to track down a problem I have on my SMP 2.2.14 system with PPP
dynamic dial-up. Somewhere near the syslog event:
	"Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS1"
I get a total hang. Magic-Sysrq does seem to work, but it normally happens
with the console blanked, and nothing is un-blanking it so no Oops!
Running with a non-modular ppp, or with ppp.o pre-inserted reduces the
frequency of the problem to 1 in 10 dial-ups (its about 1 in 3 if modular) - I
also found that aliasing the new 2.3.x devices char-major-108 and tty-ldisc-3
to "off" improves stability.
I'll give 2.2.15pre4 a go in the meantime.
Thanks,
Steve
