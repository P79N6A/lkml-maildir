Hi,
Some half a year ago I wrote about my experience of performance of
"hugemem" vs "sm" kernels for 2.4.21-9.EL kernel from RH AS 3.0
The results I got previously were 
                 smp          hugemem 
IO BOUND:      1450TPM        1250TPM
CPU BOUND:     7000TPM        4500TPM
Results are in Transactions per Minute.
This was significant regression and it was some kind of expected.
The results with newer kernel 2.4.21-15.EL  are very strange however:
                 smp          hugemem 
IO BOUND:      1150TPM        1650TPM
CPU BOUND:     6300TPM        5000TPM
Well I'm pretty happy to see "hugemem" kernel improved a lot, but 
what happened with SMP kernel ? Why it is slow now for IO bound case 
and why it became slower than 2.4.21-9.EL ? 
I'm using 4*Pentium Xeon 2.0Ghz w HT,  4GB RAM,  3WARE RAID10, EXT3
