Subject: [PATCH] make spin_is_locked use an explicit signed char case
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a trivial patch from the XFS tree and allows to use spinlock
debugging with code that is compiled with -funsigned-char.  XFS itself
shouldn't need -funsigned-char anymore, but doing the right thing in
spinlock.h doesn't cost anything.
