If desired, I can redo it standalone.
It should be clear from the remainder of the series of debug patches
that it's readily extensible to IRQ stacks for similar purposes, as
IRQ stacks are similarly vmalloc()'d by later patches in the series.
The patch to make __pa() BUG() on vmallocspace addresses may also be
worthy of consideration in conjunction with vmalloc()'ing the stack.
That particular patch was suggested by freitag.
