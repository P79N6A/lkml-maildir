Machines built with PCXS and PCXT processors are guaranteed not to have
PCI.  So this only becomes a problem when supporting non-PCI devices.
The devices you mentioned -- 53c700 & 82596 -- are core IO and really do
need to be supported.  There's also a large userbase for these machines,
dropping support for them is not an option.
T class machines don't have PCI slots per se, but they do have GSC
slots into which a card can be plugged that contains a Dino GSC to PCI
bridge and one or more PCI devices.  Examples of cards that are like
this include acenic, single and dual tulip.
On the other hand, it's going to take some really motivated person to
make T class work.  I'm firmly uninterested in it.
