Note also that gcc does sibling optimization, i.e. it will happily
reduce the code at the end of
	int bar(a,b) { [...] return baz(x,y); }
into something like
	overwrite 'a' with 'x', and 'b' with 'y'
	pop local stack frame, if present
	jump to baz
which saves some stack space and is faster, but makes you wonder
how in hell the
	baz
	foo
stack dump you're seeing in your crash dump came about.
(2.6.13 will turn that off when debugging.)
