Hi all,
I'm writing a Partition Magic clone, and I've got a spare hard drive to
test it with.  When my program (GNU parted) nukes the partition, I run
mkfs on it.  However, the old partition still appears to my program
until I reboot.
Is this a cache issue?  How can I clear the cache?  Are there any good
references on how the cache works?
