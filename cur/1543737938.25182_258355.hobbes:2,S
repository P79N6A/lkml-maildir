A week or so ago I had a problem and couldnt see which changeset
caused it. After a binary search it turned out to be the changeset
that changed the (length of the) kernel version string.
A wild pointer was harmless at first, but after shifting everything
by a few bytes it caused crashes.
Probably (hopefully) your problem is something entirely different,
but it is not impossible that kernel behaviour depends on kernel name.
