It offers more memory than 3G/1G.  This is an improvement, so of
course it is the chosen way. It was not required - you sure can use
a 3G/1G split on a 64-bit processor - but why introduce an artifical
limitation?
The requirement for using a 4G/4G split is to have a processor
that support 64-bit adressing as well as 32-bit backward compatibility.

The kernel runs in 64-bit mode, offering the 4G/4G stuff for 32-bit 
processes.

high memory is a quirky way of supporting more than 4G on a 32-bit
processor.  A 64-bit processor support much more than 4G, so no need
for tricks that work around the limitations of 32-bit processors.
