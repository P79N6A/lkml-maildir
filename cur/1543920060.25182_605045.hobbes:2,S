I really didn't find Rob's email "pejorative" at all.  It seems to me
he was just asking for clarification, information and trying to
understand how it all works and ties together.  His email seemed
genuine enough of a person just asking to understand how it all works.
Matthew's expletive and extremely rude response really shows
the general attitude of the linux-scsi people.
Heck, I got a similar response just a week ago here on the
list, trying to convince Garzik and his band, that storage nodes
SHOULD NOT be SAS WWN generators.  Should I have even tried?  That's
the question.
Good luck everyone,
