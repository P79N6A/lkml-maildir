I consider it a bug in the compiler. The gcc folk have not replied to my 
filed bug report yet so I have no idea if they agree or not...
The error messages the compiler is generating are completely bogus because 
the unnamed fields ARE of type struct or union. It's just that they are 
typedeffed so that the words "struct" and "union" do not appear. IMO that 
is a screwup by gcc...
Best regards,
