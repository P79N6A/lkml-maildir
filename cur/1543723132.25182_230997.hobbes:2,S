Thank you, I'll add this to my collection of PCMCIA device model
patches.  I have quite a selection. 8)
I still have rather a number of patches for the pcmcia resource and
socket driver side of things, and I'm hesitant to put anything other
than bug fixes in before these are all in.  This is something which
will only proceed slowly - hopefully it should be complete by 2.6.9.
This is especially slow because the only kernels which appear to be
well tested for PCMCIA are Linus' main releases and I don't want to
push too many changes in at one time.
Also, there remain races in the PCMCIA network drivers in their unload
code - they free everything and _then_ unregister from the network
layer. This should be fixed before we even think of adding device
model support... I thought I'd already sent this patch, but it seems
it never made it into the kernel.
