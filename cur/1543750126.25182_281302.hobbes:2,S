Simply storing the first hostname used in a dot file for subsequent 
reuse on client side,
would be even easier I guess. That would be basically the same strategy 
as used by
ssh with regard to host keys. It wouldn't even perhaps make protocol 
changes necessary.
But still not a perfect solution... (Remember the times you have delete 
something from
.ssh/known_hosts).
