IMHO, the string "path" is so generic (and nice, short, and sweet :-), that
only higher-level layers such as the VFS should be allowed to define it.
All other layers that are somewhere below the VFS (drivers/md/dm-mpath.h and
reiserfs), should rename their struct path to something more specific.  If
anyone component can claim "first rights" for the name "struct path" -- it's
the VFS.
That said, 'pathnode' is also good, esp. if it better describes the contents
and use of this struct.  But I would still rename all other uses of 'struct
path' below the VFS.
