Having an SMP box, and noting all the SMP crash reports I did some 
light reading :) of the IA32 System Programming Manual.  I came
up with a scenario for P6 SMP spinlock corruption/theft:
CPU0  has and clears spinlock SL.  The write is still in cache not mem
CPU1  tries to read SL.
CPU0  sees the read and helpfully signals HITM# and passes the line.
CPU1  starts receiving the line and sets SL
CPU0  "simultaneously" sets SL in it's cache line.
Both CPUs think they have SL, and will cause nonreentrancy chaos. 
Of course, this is going to be _very_ rare.  But spinlocks spin,
and spinlocks are often called again. But what is "simultaneous"?
The 40-60 ns it takes to transfer the cache line--24 cpu clocks 
with a 6x multiplier?  The same busclock?  The same CPU clock?
Ref [1]&[2] are very clear that LOCK only goes as far as cache
(L1 or L2?) and memory writes can be long delayed for write-back
cached memory. [3] describes the HITM# mechanism.
Unless HITM# also sets the sent cache line to MESI "invalid",
then the simultaneous write could happen.  Most likely, it sets
shared.  CPU0 can certainly read a clear SL in it's cache.  And 
CPU1 just got it as it's supposed to be (shared?).  The chipset is 
supposed to write the HITM# to DRAM (if the BX isn't throttled).
First write sets "exclusive" on itself, "invalid" on the other,
and goes to DRAM.  But what if writes are "simultaneous"?
Reading between the lines of the full Chapters 7 & 9, write-back 
cached DRAM has higher performance, but is not fully SMP coherent.  
Fortunately, a solution is also hinted at:  use write-thru or
uncachable attributes (PCD & PWT) for critical memory. 
Is this correct?  or have I misread something?

> For the P6 family processors, if the area of memory being locked
