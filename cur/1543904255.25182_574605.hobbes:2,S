Romfs is used quite extensively in the uClinux space, and
mostly on very small flash setups (can be as small as 1MB
of flash). Any filesystem size increase would not be
welcomed :-)
But ofcourse as long as the romfs filesystem code still
supports the older version there is no problem (and it
looks like it does).
