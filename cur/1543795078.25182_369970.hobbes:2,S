I think what he wants is that you could have preferences, but that 
something functional if not optimal would be selected. What would 
actually be useful is if the kernel would provide a small report of the 
video hardware in some useful format, such that (example) 
/proc/somthing/video_config could be included in the xorg.conf.
Yes, a number of distributions build the xorg.conf at install time, 
although it's sometimes wrong and can't readily be made right after the 
fact. And really should come from kernel info found at boot time, I believe.
