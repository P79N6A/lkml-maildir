Thanks for pointing them out. I have fixed it in the experimental version
that I have now.

I actually started with using the calibrated value of PMTMR_TICKS_PER_JIFFY 
rather than compile time constant (as found in verify_pmtmr), but later dropped
the idea since I didnt get good results with it. After that didnt revert
back pm_ticks_per_jiffy to be a macro. But good point, will include
this in the next patch that I am trying out. Will post it if I happen
to have success :)
