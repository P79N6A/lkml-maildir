Hi,
it is possible to to patch the reiser4 code into 2.6.15-rc5-rt4, but 
rcu_barrier() is only available within the #ifndef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU block 
in kernel/rcupdate.c. However, if one has CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y, then 
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y, and hence no rcu_barrier() and the other two 
functions are available.
Does anyone have a patch that adds a rcu_barrier() and friends to the 
PREEMT_RCU block?
