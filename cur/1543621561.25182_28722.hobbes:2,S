xfs-2.4.18-rc1-shawn6   against 2.4.17 vanilla. (Feb 17th, 2002)
Contains:
2.4.18-rc1                      (Marcelo Tosatti)

Newest XFS from CVS-HEAD        (me)
IDE taskfile IO patch           (Andre Hedrick)
* NOTES:
Removed -pre9-ac4 because Quotas seem to break hard with XFS/EXT2/3.
- This hurts the merge of XFS into -mjc until we sort this out.
Shawn.
