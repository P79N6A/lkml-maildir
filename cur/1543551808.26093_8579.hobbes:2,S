LBA 0 PIO Read Test                      = 5.32 MB/Sec (46.98 Seconds)
LBA 1 PIO Read Test                      = 5.32 MB/Sec (46.99 Seconds)

LBA 0 DMA Read Test                      = 48.84 MB/Sec (5.12 Seconds)
LBA 1 DMA Read Test                      = 49.07 MB/Sec (5.09 Seconds)
Outer Diameter Sequential DMA Read Test  = 26.53 MB/Sec (9.42 Seconds)
Inner Diameter Sequential DMA Read Test  = 14.68 MB/Sec (17.03 Seconds)
LBA 1 DMA Write Test                     = 44.94 MB/Sec (5.56 Seconds)
Outer Diameter Sequential DMA Write Test = 14.72 MB/Sec (16.98 Seconds)

These are all 4000 IO's at 128 blocks each or a total of 512,000 blocks.
Not to bad........
Now we can profile drives to super-charge the elevator!!
One catch, these tests require a native ATA-passthough and that will not
be included until 2.5.........
It is completely stable with the tested data-phases.
