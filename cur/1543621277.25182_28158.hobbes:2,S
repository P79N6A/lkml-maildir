Hello plep,
	You have recently requested that your nickname password be sent
to you.  Please take the time to write it down now for future
reference.  Store it wisely, remember that password security is
your responsibility.
	Your password is: register
	You may report any abuse of this SENDPASS feature by forwarding
this email to: sabuse@DAL.net
	You may also stop future e-mails from being sent by using the
MAILBLOCK feature online by first identifying to your nickname,
then typing:
   /msg NickServ@services.dal.net SET MAILBLOCK ON
	CAUTION: If you enable the MAILBLOCK feature, you will no
longer be able to request your password be sent via email and
you will be responsible for keeping track of it on your own.
	The details of this request follow.
