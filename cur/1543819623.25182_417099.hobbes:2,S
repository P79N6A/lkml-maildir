I just wrote the following which I believe is your test scenario?
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
int fd, err, pid;
	fd = open("/tmp/protected", O_RDONLY);
	if (fd == -1){
		perror("open") ; return 1;
	}
	err=unlink("/tmp/protected");
	if (err == -1){
		perror("unlink"); close(fd); return 1;
	}
	pid=fork();
	if (pid){
		wait();
	}else{
		close(0);
		dup(fd);
		execl("/bin/cat", "/bin/cat", NULL);
	}
	close(fd);
}
d_path reports "/tmp/protected (deleted)" for the dentry in this situation 
when /bin/cat attempts to access it.
It happens a lot with nscd which likes to open files, unlink them and pass
them over unix domain sockets.  Our old code used to have to remove the 
(deleted) [in a safe manner of course]. With the posted patch to d_path to
generate pathnames back to the namespace root I took advantage of including
some control of the appending for unhashed dentries.

Now how you handle what confinement the forked process should have is 
determined when you generate policy. /bin/cat in this situation can run under
it's own policy (probably not ideal in this situation), inherit the openers
(probably the ideal choice), or none at all (if you believe it does not
require confinement).

I'm not sure how.  Perhaps with the above example you can elaborate as 
necessary.  Also thanks for posting the question.
