In my experience with a number of very large banks etc, when people
need mission-critical fault-tolerant systems, they use a complete
hardware/OS/software solution such as tandem.  For normal high
avaliability, something like a unix H/A pair (such as two suns) is
very common.  
If you think fsck time is a factor in the equation then your H/A
solution is almost certainly inadequate to your needs.  Only a
slahdotter would think that an ftp server had a mission-critical H/A
requirement.  Think about swift message servers (where every message
is a direct transfer of funds), think about settlement systems (which
settle transactions worth sometimes hundreds of millions), and think
about trading systems.  For example, I worked in a bank where someone
forgot to send a fax confirmation and it cost the bank £1000000.
fsck time isn't a consideration in these sorts of settings.  Its much
more important in the more common case where you just want your
web/ftp/quakeserver up asap.
