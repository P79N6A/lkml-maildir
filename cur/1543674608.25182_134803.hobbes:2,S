   According to RFC2367, all reserved bytes must be set to zero.  This
   patch does just that for the sadb_prop messages.
I applied your fix except that I decided to use memset().
Please use netdev@oss.sgi.com and/or linux-net@vger.kernel.org
in the future.  Most networking hackers don't read linux-kernel
and thus wouldn't be able to review your fix.
Thanks.
