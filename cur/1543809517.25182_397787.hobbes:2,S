The NMI watchdog triggers only when the kernel as a whole locks up.  That
isn't what's happening here.  What is occuring is that the HDA side of
things is entering a seemingly endless loop, but the rest of the kernel
continues to function normally.
In any case, I did the above and booted with "nmi_watchdog=2 lapic".  I
triggered the fault but neither the soft lockup nor NMI watchdog triggered,
which given the above was of no surprise.
The "azx_get_response timeout" is only produced by a single function:
azx_get_response() in hda_intel.c.  This in turn seems to be called from
only one location - azx_codec_create() in hda_intel.c.  azx_probe() calls
azx_codec_create() exactly once, and azx_probe() is the .probe method for
the PCI driver definition.  Given that the above call chain in hda-intel.c
does not contain any loops, I conclude that the PCI code is repeatedly
calling the probe method due (presumedly) to the repeated timeouts.  I can't
see how else azx_get_response() could be called repeatedly.
As mentioned in the original post, other kernels display the timeout
message.  However, they do not loop endlessly and the driver load succeeds
(presumedly on the second attempt, since only one timeout message was ever
seen at a time).  Applying rt16 to 2.6.15 seems to change something which
causes the endless timeouts.  The condition doesn't exist all the time; once
it does exist however it persists until reboot.  Note too that the condition
seems to only affect the HDA side of things - all other components of the
kernel appear to function correctly.
The machine in question is an i915-based laptop using PCI-express internally.
Any other suggestions as to tests which might narrow down the problem's cause?
