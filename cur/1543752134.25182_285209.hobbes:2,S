Subject: [PATCH] V-6.1 ZAPHOD Single Priority Array O(1) CPU Scheduler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/10/424

Version 6.1 of the ZAPHOD single priority array scheduler patches for
the 2.6.10 kernel are now available for download and evaluation from:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/patch-2.6.10-spa_zaphod_FULL-v6.1?download>
This contains the extra per runqueue CPU statistics for improving GA 
fitness functions that we discussed.
struct runq_cpustats {
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	unsigned long long timestamp_last_tick;
#endif
	unsigned long long total_delay;
	unsigned long long total_rt_delay;
	unsigned long long total_intr_delay;
	unsigned long long total_fork_delay;
	unsigned long long total_sinbin;
};
total_delay - is total time spent by tasks waiting for CPU on this runqueue
total_rt_delay - as for total_delay but only for real time tasks
total_intr_delay - is total time spent by tasks waiting for CPU on this 
runqueue after being woken to service an interrupt
total_fork_delay - is total time spent by tasks waiting for CPU on this 
runqueue for their first time slice after forking
