Hi,
	Really weird!
	I have two linux machines with kernel 2.4.17. When I ping one
machine from the other machine, all the ping request ip packets have the
same sequnce number 0. The ping reply packets have different ip
sequence numbers. Moreover, when I send udp packets using general
socket programming, all the udp packets have the same sequence number 0.
	I use ethereal to check the packets.
	What's the problem?
	Thanks!
Xinwen Fu
