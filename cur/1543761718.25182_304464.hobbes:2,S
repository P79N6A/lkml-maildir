The 4-level page tables slowdowns don't explain the problems you
are seeing. 2.6.12-rc1 is very close to 2.6.10 speed. The slowdown
we are talking about is on the order of microseconds at process
exit time, and unmap.
So please continue to investigate your problems. I think there may
have been some small CPU scheduler changes between 2.6.10 and
2.6.11 from Con. Seems unlikely that they would be causing your
problems, but that's my suggestion for a starting point.
Thanks,
Nick
