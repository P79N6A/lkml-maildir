The LKML message I/O scheduling rules suggest that if a fair number of
reads are not processed prior to write activity, then a lot of bandwidth
can be wasted and the medium can eventually become write-only due to
messsage storms. This can be avoided by ensuring writers block to allow
their read activity to progress first - the write should in general be
dependent on the reads in any case. As per Andrew Morton's post on
anticipatory scheduling, a short delay before doing the write to allow
further reads to take place is often a good idea in this context too.
