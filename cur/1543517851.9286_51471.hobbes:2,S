Is that likely to be fixed anytime soon? I've just accepted a system
for configuring under RedHat 6.1 that is to be used as a combined
firewalled gateway with transparent proxy implemented, so this is
definately bad news for me !!!
Alternatively, which STABLE kernel can I use where it works and there
aren't any bugs I can't work round?
Best wishes from Riley.
