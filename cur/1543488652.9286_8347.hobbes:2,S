Not always. A lot of problems are actually simply caused by dumb PC
builders. They do stuff like stick a price tag on top of the CPU, on what
_was_ a nice extremely flat heat contact surface.
I've had trouble with the Cyrix-MII and heat which got solved by using
proper heatsink compound (I cannot believe vendors skip this - its virtually
zero cost to them and it makes a lot of difference). 
The K6 I've had no problems with, although I know friends who had dumb vendors
doing the price tag on the CPU top trick who did have problems. Special bonus
goes to the vendor who put an "if removed this voids warranty" serial number
sticker on the CPU. Duhhhh.
If you look on Usenet you'll find people reporting "mpeg encoding mysteriously
slows down on my new PIII after 15 minutes" - that appears to be PIII cooling
problems they are having (the PIII seems to drop to 1/4 speed instead of
just executing a shutdown cycle or dying randomly as the Cyrix does)
