Hello,
I have released another version of the perfmon new code base package.
This release is relative to 2.6.17-rc1
There were, once again, new system calls added. As such a new libpfm is
necessary.
This new kernel patch includes several changes:
	- Merged i386 and x86_64 perfmon.c architecture specific codes
	- Merged PMU description modules for em64t and p4.
	- support for automatic loading of PMU description modules if
	  CONFIG_KMOD=y. Make sure you run make modules_install
	- MIPS patches are back and are applied onto the mainline kernel
This release uses the new/mod patch breakdown for all architectures.
To apply, you can simply do:
	cat ../perfmon-new-base-060405/*.diff | patch -p1 
The new version of the library, libpfm, includes the following changes:
	- updated to match 2.6.17-rc1 new system call numbers
	- modified pfmlib.h to use 64-bit integer for generic PMC register
	  (submitted by Kevin Corry from IBM)
I have finally created a minimal home page for the project. So now
you can access the latest news and files from:
	
http://perfmon2.sf.net
I received notification from SF.net, that the libpfm package has been installed
into our CVS repository. It should become visible fairly quickly now. Once this
happens, I will update the tree to include this new version of the library.
Enjoy,
