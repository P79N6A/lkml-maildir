I fought with them for quite some time to get the major rewrite that 
occured between
level 5 and level 6. The level 6 driver in TLT and OSDL is a version 
that has many of
my suggestions and a few enhancements in it. It is "much better than a 
stick in the eye".
We should now be in sync with their releases. I haven't looked recently 
to see if there
is something newer than the one I checked in.
It still has a long way to go. I have threatened to rewrite it more than 
once. However,
there is a plan to get Qlogic to do all of this and the presentation 
keeps getting put off.
It needs to be rewritten for the "so called" hardend driver stuff and 
that would be a
good juncture to make the rewrite happen.
Hacking the driver source is next to useless - Qlogic releases from 
their own tree
constantly. They are OK about taking things back but are a bit slow.
I can help with any suggested changes and cleanups.
