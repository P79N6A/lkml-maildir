Yeah, OTOH I'm also happy for the time being running 2.4.3 (actually 
2.4.3-ac6 right now) which is OK at full-speed UDMA5, until the problem 
is fixed. Just thought people might like to know. :-)

I only just joined, to report this - I did scan the archives though, and 
saw a lot of *older* discussion of VIA problems, but didn't see anything 
that definitely said it was still there after the 2.4.3-ac7 fixes, so 
wasn't sure if anyone was on the case. :-)
