Its on linuxtoday now and its probably only a matter of time
before it hits slashdot... the full interview is at
http://computer.org/computer/thompson.htm
 
(but the full linux quote was in my earlier mail)
I don't know anything about how the kernel works, and if this
sort of discussion doesn't belong here, please stop me. But it
seems to me:
* if he examined the source and found some of it is bad, maybe he
  could tell people what exactly is bad? Maybe he'd be willing to
  do that, especially if some people on this list know him?
* if he and his friends used linux and found it unreliable,
  that runs counter to the experience of near everyone else. It's
  sad that he wanted to make such unforgiving, unbalanced
  computers in a widely read magazine.
* he talks of non-PC hardware: well I don't know about ultrasparc
  but it runs fine on our alphas (apart from that 48 day problem
  which I hope is cured now -- but I'd like to see M$ run for 48
  days). Does he *really* know what he's talking about or is he
  one of those who just dislike linux for some ideological reason?
