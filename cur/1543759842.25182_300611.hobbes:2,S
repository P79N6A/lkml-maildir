:)
All other stacks requires special flags and various complex schemas 
to support batching,
but acrypto provides session queue to the low-level driver, 
so it does not require any special cruft to support session batching.
So we have batching just after new driver birth, 
that is why it is genetic.

Thank you for your comments, I will put updates into the queue,
and push them if acrypto will be commited.
