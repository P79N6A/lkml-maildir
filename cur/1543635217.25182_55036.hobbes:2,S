non-blocking is a matter of behavior. It easily doesn't block.
The man page says
 O_NONBLOCK or O_NDELAY
	When  possible,  the file is opened in non-blocking
	mode. Neither the open nor  any  subsequent  opera-
	tions on the file descriptor which is returned will
	cause the calling process to wait.   For  the  han-
	dling  of  FIFOs  (named  pipes), see also fifo(4).
	This mode need not have any effect on  files  other
	than FIFOs.
So it shouldn't work outside FIFOs. However, have a look at net/ipv4/tcp.c 
for more details.
