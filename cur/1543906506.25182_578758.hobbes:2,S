We are actually a bit beyond traditional K&R, fwiw.
C99 spec that Al referred you to (available for around US$18 as a pdf)
says in 6.7.8, para. 14 (where Al said):
"An array of character type may be initialized by a character string literal, optionally
enclosed in braces. Successive characters of the character string literal (including the
terminating null character if there is room or if the array is of unknown size) initialize the
elements of the array."
