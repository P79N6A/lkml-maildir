This is the dvb_attach() "not found" message.  You should see this same
message if you leave dst selected and then just delete the dst modules before
loading dvb-bt8xx.
If you turn dvb_attach off, you should see a different "dst support was
disabled" message (and no crash!).

When I made this patch I was basing it off a patch I made around 9 months
ago.  I thought since that one was ok, this would be ok too, and in my
hurry to get it done I've clearly put too little effort into checking it,
and I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
I promise, this time it's right!
