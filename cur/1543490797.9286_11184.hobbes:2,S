acct.c: In function `sys_acct':
acct.c:197: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
acct.c:203: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
I believe that the solution is to add NULL as the second parameter and am about
to try that now.  Could someone who really knows please make a proper patch and
submit it to Linux.

I am in London and would like to meet any Linux users here.
I plan to work in London for 6 months and then I might move to some other
place where the pay is good.
