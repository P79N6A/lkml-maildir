eSATA is new to me, ive never used it.
im guessing a linux box makes a good host for a eSATA device, but i
was wondering if it can appear as a device to other computers.
Ive just built myself a NAS box and as some of them have a way to
directly attach to one computer, i would like mine to as well. it is
not possible via usb without buying a different controller as all in
standard PCs are hosts.
Can i do it with firewire (appear as a attached device)? or is IP over
firewire the only way to do it?
ive searched the net for this, hope you can help
