Look in there, there is a call to wake_up or similar, some waitqueue is not
set up correctly. This has happened before, the cases remaining seem to be
when the waitqueue is in a dynamically created structure that is
initialized to zeroes with memset(3), but that won't work anymore for
waitqueues. Zeroes force an oops when trying to use the waitqueue later
precicely for catching this.  I patched drivers/char/serial.c and
drivers/block/ide.c that had this problem, look at the list or the lastest
official patches.
Sorry I can't help you more, the details depend on your configuration and
what is being initialized just there will tell you where to look.
Good luck!
