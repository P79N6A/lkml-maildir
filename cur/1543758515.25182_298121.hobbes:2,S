Err, isn't it "Acked-by:"??  I thought "Signed-off-by:" was only for 
when
the patch actually went through someone's tree and was forwarded by them
to somebody else:
EG:
John Doe writes a patch that fixes a NULL pointer deref, and he sends it
to Andrew Morton.  The maintainer of the driver, Jane McDonald, confirms
the fix via email to this list.  Andrew forwards it to Linus, who
includes it in his next release.  The resulting notations look like 
this:
Signed-off-by: John Doe
Acked-by: Jane McDonald
Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton
Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds
