Ok, I tried the inline password form, and it is still mounted, except
pagefile.sys is inaccessible.  Hmm, really wanted to screw with my NT
box's paging. ;) (j/k).  I last mounted that partition this morning,
when I sent my last message.  So, I guess this would really be a samba
problem, and not a kernel problem.  
However, I really don't like entering the password that way.  A grep on
.bash_history for the password is plenty of reason for *that* little
bias!  Too bad there's not a way to alert bash that a particular string
is actually a password, and that that string shouldn't be kept in
~/.bash_history.
