Right now yes, but we are going to change this?

TASK_TRACED task could be woken by SIGKILL. cancel_freezing() clears TIF_FREEZE.
The task may start do_exit() when try_to_freeze_tasks() returns "success".
Probably not a problem.

Yes, I misread cancel_freezing(), it doesn't wake up the task if it is frozen.

This means that "current" returns to user space (get_signal_to_deliver
will clear TIF_SIGPENDING) and runs. While try_to_freeze_tasks() thinks
it is frozen.
