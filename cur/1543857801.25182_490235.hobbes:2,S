That's really not the point.
What's the whole _reason_ for 2.6.x.y releases?
They should be safe, and OBVIOUS. 
If there is a box that breaks with a 2.6.x.y release, then that .y release 
was clearly a mistake, and fundamentally broke the whole point of the 
stable tree. If you can't depend on the stable tree being a real 
improvement - regardless of what hw you are on - then the stable tree has 
lost all meaning, and you'd be better off just getting 2.6.x+1 instead.
