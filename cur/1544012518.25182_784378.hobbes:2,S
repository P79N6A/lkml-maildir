Well, I asked Jeremy to use Becky's approach so I don't have though
this patchset isn't enough for Becky (possibly for Xen too) since
Jeremy didn't put Becky's map_single_page changes. These changes are
necessary to support map_map_page with highmem. I think that we can do
it simpler than his patch. I'll send patches to that in a different
way soon.
It's not principal objection, but as I said, the patches to revert
Jeremy's highmem patches in this patchset like the following are
pointless.

    revert "swiotlb: support bouncing of HighMem pages."
    git commit ef9b189352f2eb78f14e52996f4780a523b04a49
This doesn't explain why we reverted it. The two approaches are
different so there is no point to merge these patch in this way.
There is no patches in tip/core/iommu except for this swiotlb
stuff. The end result is exactly same (I just reordered patches). So
there is nothing to worry. You can safely replace tip/core/iommu with
this tree.
