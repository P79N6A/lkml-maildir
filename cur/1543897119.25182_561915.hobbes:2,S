That is true on most CPUs.  Some CPUs really really need
some of things that -Os disables (compared to -O2) for
decent performance though (branch target alignment...)

-Os and tune some options.  There is extensive work being
done over the last few years to make GCC more suitable for
embedded targets btw.  But the -O1/-O2/-O3/-Os gives you
four choices only, it's really not so hard to understand
I hope that for more specific goals you need to add more
specific options?
