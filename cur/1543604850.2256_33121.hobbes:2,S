Hello everyone,
I've been running 2.4.10 and 2.4.12 on my new Dell inspiron 8100, both of 
which seems to hang as soon as I unplug the power coord, or close the lid.
This problem is even without running X11 at all. Or when removing Power 
Managment from the kernel and/or disabeling it in the bios.
I found a previous message on the kernel mailing list which seems to be
the same bug, I will include it here (I personaly haven't tried 2.4.5 yet):
