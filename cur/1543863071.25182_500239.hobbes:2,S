Maybe, if you are talking about my advice to fix userspace... but you
*are* going to contribute those changes back for the nommu community
to use, right? So the end result of that is _not_ actually tweaking the
end solutions.
But actually, if you take the reserved pool approach, then that will
work fine, in-kernel, and it is something that already needs to be done
for dynamic hugepage allocations which is almost exactly the same
situation. And everybody can use this as well (I think most of the code
is written already, but not merged).

OK that's fair enough, but considering that it doesn't actually fix
the problem properly; and that it does weird and wonderful things with
our already fragile page reclaim path, then it is not a good idea to
merge it upstream.
