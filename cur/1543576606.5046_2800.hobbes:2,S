Nodes can be wicked expensive. :-)
Pushing the performance envelope is important when you want to
sell lots of systems. Radar is a similar computational task,
with the added need to reduce space and weight requirements.
It's not OK to be 5% more expensive, bulky, and heavy.
Also the Airplane Principal: more nodes means more big failures.
