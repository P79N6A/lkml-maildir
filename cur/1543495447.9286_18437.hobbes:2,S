Cheated is a little hard.

Well we bang heads again.

It is not worthless, as much as everyone wants to think that the original
sample of drive->id is never tampered with is still a dream.  The only way
the kernel can even think about seeing beyond 8.4GB is the correct the CHS
and capacity.  One should note that twiddling with drive->id was in place
long before the task of IDE maintainance was passed to me from Mark L.
Look into a pre 2.1.121 or older development kernel and you see that it
existed before I refined the tinker that is not finished.

The "-I" is preserved to allow us to interrigate the drive for the raw
values of the 512 sector_word.
