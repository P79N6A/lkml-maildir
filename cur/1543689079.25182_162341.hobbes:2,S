For Larry's case, you're right. Nothing you can do to shape lots of
incoming TCP connections. However, if you're facing a few long-lived
TCP connections, you can shape them by dropping incoming packets (that
is, shaping the outgoing packets from the router/shaper to the LAN).
The sending side will adjust its rate after at most a few seconds.
That works perfectly for the case of reserving bandwidth for critical
services in the face of ongoing large downloads. That's something
a lot of people want and need, so it's not all that worseless per se.
