I don't know if anyone's mentioned this yet or not, but I've gotten
better performance with 2.2.0-pre1 versus my 2.1.125.. I don't know
where the changes happened, but it's definitely an improvement..
My system doesn't swap out netscape when I leave like it used to and the
system seems a lot faster with disk access and loading programs.  I'm
not sure why this is, but it certainly seems better.  Could it be that I
had 2.1.125 up for 30 days before I had to take it down for 2.2.0-pre1
and there was/is a memory leak somewhere?
Not sure.
Anyway, ignore this post if there have been changes that are significant
between 2.1.125 and 2.2.0-pre1
