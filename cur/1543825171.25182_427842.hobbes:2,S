How about external modules that have a kernel dependant part and kernel 
independant part?. Kernel independant part could live in a separate tree and
has its own makefiles.
But regparm requires that ALL parts linked into the module need to have regparm 
defined. So it's another headache to write makefiles for the kernel independant 
part to figure out if the distro support regparm or not.
