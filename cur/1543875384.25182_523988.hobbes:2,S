that is the whole point. The slash was never meant to be used. It was
designed to take a filename or a pattern that will be later matched by
userspace. However some developers are now trying to abuse this since
the simple firmware helper script matches this directly to a filename
(and directory in this case) on the disk.
Putting a slash in the request_firmware() call now enforces a
subdirectory and that should be left up to the userspace. So the slash
is actually a forbidden character here.

Marcel
