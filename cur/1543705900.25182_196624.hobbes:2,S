[ helpful info snipped ]
Interesting, thank you.  That's the second report (first on 16 Jan,
and in that case Not Tainted).  I looked around and found some bugs in
the swapfile page accounting (if swapfile filesystem blocksize < 4k:
is yours?  never heard back from Marcel on that) - still intermittently
working on and testing the fixes there - but in the end nothing which
would actually cause this BUG.  Was rather thinking it came from slab
corruption, but a second report makes that (a little) less likely.
I'll look again later on, but other eyes may find it sooner.
