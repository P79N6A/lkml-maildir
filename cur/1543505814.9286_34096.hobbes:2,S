Hello, Remy.
I've just refined synchronous-updates-mount mode of ext2fs.
Ext2 mounted "sync" works very slow and ext2 might be damaged
seriously in an event of crash.
So I decided to redesign them.
Patch is availabe at
    
http://www03.u-page.so-net.ne.jp/da2/h-takaha/
This patch makes your linux:
  1. robust in an event of crash.
     keeping consitency of meta-data of filesystem.
  2. improving performances.
The peformances of ext2fs applied this patch is bellow:
  ----------------------------------------------------
  Machine spec:  Pentium(166MHz) IDE-Disk(Western Degital AC31600H)
             time cp -r src/linux /tmp  time rm -r src/linux
   linux         16 min 25 sec                3 min 2 sec
   linux+patch    3 min 21 sec                1 min 49 sec
  ----------------------------------------------------
My first aproach to implement them is 'fail-safe and fail-soft':
 - write meta-data back to disk in safe order.
 - initialize meta-data on disk at first use.
 - keep link-count of inodes zero when creating files.
Second, minimize loss of performance:
 - it isn't neccesary to synhronous-update inode-bitmaps and
   block-bitmaps. E2fsck will repair them perfectly.
 - it isn't neccesary to synhronous-update inode and indirect-block,
   this does'nt cause any problems.
Any comments any suggestions are welcome, Please e-mail me.
Regards,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
