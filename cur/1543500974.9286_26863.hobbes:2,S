Folks, I'm sorry to bother the list, but I really need to find the analysis
that someone did and (I believe) posted a pointer to the list in the last
24 hours or so.  It compared the benchmark results and then was pointing
out that you didnt need MP unless you had 10 T1 lines or something like
that.  Does anyone know where this?  Thanks in advance, please reply just
to me to not bother the list.
