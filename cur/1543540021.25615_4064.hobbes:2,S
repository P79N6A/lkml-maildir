Indeed, that's why I #include <asm/fcntl.h>, to find the header file.
I've assumed that <asm/fcntl.h> reflects something close to the current
kernel, which wouldn't work with Linus' setup.
Probably I should follow Linus' (a) suggestion (define the constants in
the program for combination of Linux & known architecture), and also
accept the value if it appears through plain old <fcntl.h>.  Any newer
architecture than current ones in the kernel tree ought to be using a
Glibc that defines the thing I'm interested in via plain old <fcntl.h>.
