According to the Unix spec: per-process.
Older Linux kernels applied it per-thread. Newer kernels can handle it 
per-process, and AFAIK it's the default for NPTL.

Fixed in 2.6. But there is another bug in that block: undos can increase 
the semaphore value above SEMVMX.

Correct. undo operations should never try to decrease the semaphore 
value - an attempt to decrease below 0 is either silently ignored, or 
the semaphore value is set to 0.
