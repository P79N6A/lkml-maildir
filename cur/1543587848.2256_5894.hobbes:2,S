Hi,
When my parport printer runs out of paper and there are still
pending print jobs, the kernel will constantly log the following:
DMA write timed out
parport0: FIFO is stuck
parport0: BUSY timeout (1) in compat_write_block_pio
To me it's pretty pointless to fill dmesg and the logfiles with
this rather harmless but still annoying info.
Can this possibly be handled in a nicer way, so that the kernel
keeps quiet about such minor printer issues?
Regards,
Udo.
