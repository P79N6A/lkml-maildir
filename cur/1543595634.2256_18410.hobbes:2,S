No, plain old close() on the file descriptor returned by sigopen()
would do the trick.

IMHO sigopen()/read() should behave just like sigwait() with respect 
to threads.  That means that in Posix, it would not be thread specific,
but in Linux, it would be thread specific, because that's how signals
and threads work there at the moment.

Between sigopen() and close(), calling signal() or sigaction() on that 
signal would probably return EBUSY.   A well-behaved program already
looks for an unoccupied signal using sigaction (as Jamie Lokier
points out), so they shouldn't try to reuse a signal in use by sigopen().
