In this case, there seems to be a buglet.  I turned on the nvidia/amd drives 
under the ATA section of the menu, and turned off the pata_amd under the sata 
menu in xconfig.
But I've tried twice now and it fails to build the initrd because the pata_amd 
module is on the missing list.  Of course its missing, I didn't have it 
built...
Next?
