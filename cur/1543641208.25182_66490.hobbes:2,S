You don't.  If they have to wait, then they wait.
    You'd need a lock count here, where you can only change the
    credentials when the count is zero. But when will that ever be?
It depends... for most non-threaded applications, immediately... for
threaded applications with lots of (day) disk IO, it could be
indefinite.
    And btw, the count bumping/downing does cost.
Almost immeasurable.  [sg]et[eu]id doesn't get called that often.
