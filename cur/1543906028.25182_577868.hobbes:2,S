Just so you guys have it all in one pretty little package, these will remove
the need for the Pegasos IDE and ISA fixups in the prom_init.c too.
s" /pci@80000000/ide@C,1" find-device
d# 14 encode-int 0 encode-int
d# 15 encode-int 0 encode-int
encode+ encode+ encode+ s" interrupts" property
0x1018a encode-int s" class-code" property
device-end
s" /pci@80000000/isa@C" find-device
0x1 encode-int 0x0 encode-int 0x1006000 encode-int
0x0 encode-int 0x0 encode-int 0x1000 encode-int
encode+ encode+ encode+ encode+ encode+ s" ranges" property
device-end
If anyone wants to test and confirm the 8042 fix and then we can add
it to the end here.. we can unclutter the kernel.
