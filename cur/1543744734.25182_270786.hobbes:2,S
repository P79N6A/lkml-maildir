Hello list,
I'm currently contemplating getting an USB webcam. As a requirement, it has to 
be linux-usable (duh). Now, the Philips webcams look pretty good, but I'm 
getting mightily confused by the current status of the pwc / pwcx driver.
There seems to be an 'official' driver, but that has been discontinued, and 
now there seems to be an 'unofficial' one.
Is there still a working driver for 2.4/2.6? What does it support? 
Thanks.
Jan
