Yep, but they should be handled. Of course in theory it could be a subtle
bug in the prefetch handler. But normally even when that goes wrong you
just get a obvious oops on the prefetch instruction itself.
When you disable the use of prefetch does it still happen?

Both K8/K7 are usually a lot faster and a lot more aggressive in out of order 
execution than the P3 box. A P4 would be a better comparison.

A bigger sample size that shows it really only happens on AMD first would be useful.
