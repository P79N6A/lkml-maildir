There's a hell of a big difference between "type this code into
EDITOROFCHOICE, compile and run and your drive is a paperweight" and
"rebuilt the kernel, deleting this bit and inserting this replacement
driver, then proceed as above".

Disagreed. You want to make directories editable directly, perhaps? How
about just running root's apps in ring 0? After all, you assume root is
perfect and infallible, right?

Yep. There's a big red self-destruct button on the drive. Either we leave
it enabled, or switch it off. I prefer the latter - leaving those things
lying around is just *begging* for the next Linux crack story to go "some
bastard got in with an old buffer overflow exploit, and toasted my $10k
server just by running a shell script". I don't want to see that one...

Once blocked by the kernel, you have to do strange and nasty things
(screwing with the kernel, then rebooting with your own version, or using
Linux's biggest security flaw to bypass everything) to get this `feature'
available again. At a later date, I want to see that flaw closed too, but
it's harder.
