I really don't care whether we sleep 100 or 5000 years in the case of
"sleep MAX_LONG"

One thing you ignore is that your patch does not cure the introduced
user space breakage, it just replaces the overflow caused very short
sleep by a return -EINVAL, which is breaking existing userspace in a
different way. We have to preserve user space interfaces even when they
violate your aesthetic well-being.
