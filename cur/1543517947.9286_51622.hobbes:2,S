Another great reason for Open Source device drivers, so you can debug 
them. If you have problems with a binary device driver, 99% of the 
time the same problem will show up if you compile that device driver 
as with full source debugging enabled, and then you *can* debug it.
I will re-iterate this again to make sure it is clear:
 Binary portable modules != close source proprietry drivers
It makes a hell of a lot of sense for the source code to binary 
portable modules to be Open Source so that people can solve these 
problems. These are all great arguments for the virtues of Open 
Source.
I would rather see vendors release Open Source device drivers because 
they understand these benefits, than because they are forced to do 
so. Then Linux and the Open Source revolution will win because it is 
just plain technically superior.
Remember that the reason Windows is where is is today is because of 
bullying tactics by Microsoft. Why should Linux have to succeed based 
on the same bullying tactics to force hardware vendors to open their 
specifications?

Again, another great reason for Open Source device drivers.
