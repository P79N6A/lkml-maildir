Right.  If we're introducing new deadlock possibilities, then sure we
can fix the obvious cases in ext2, but it will be next to impossible
to do a thorough audit of all of the other filesystems.  Adding in the
new shrink_icache loop into the VFS just feels too dangerous right
now.
Of course, that doesn't mean we shouldn't remove the excessive
superblock locking from ext2 --- rather, it is simply more robust to
keep the two issues separate.
