You seem to be misunderstanding what I mean. sys_overcommit(off) here is
an imaginary syscall which disables overcommit completely on a
per-process basis.

See above.

Don't be so pedantic. It can write to the result file at regular
intervals using msync(). It's only a bloody example.

Ok, I'm shocked how you can come to that conclusion from the example I
gave. HOW can that example program die, apart from hardware failure as
you so pedantically point out?

Inefficient, and pointless if you just have non-overcommit. Not to
mention it doesn't work. See below.

It's only example. If you want to be that pedantic about it, then make
it write results out every now and then. Probably one extra line of
code.

Does not work. Your code pages (read-only, shared mapping) can get
paged, and when they're hit again, you die. You can make sure nothing
gets paged by using mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE) but that has two
problems:
1) The free pages count is incorrect when there are any shared read-only
mappings. This is a bug.
2) When mlockall'd you have the nasty side-effect of having all mappings
faulted in whether you want it or not - even if they're mapped with
PROT_NONE. Not necessarily a bug, but not pleasant either.
Again, why are you so opposed (e.g the most frequent poster on this
topic) to non-overcommit? Seeing as you've made it clear you'd never use
it, why are you trying to stop us using it?
