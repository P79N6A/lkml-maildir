If I'm not mistaken any skb on the receive side might get
allocated from the reserve. I don't see how the user could
avoid this except by not using queueing at all.
I also didn't see a patch dropping packets allocated from
the reserve that are forwarded or processed directly without
getting queued to a socket, so this would allow them to
bypass userspace queueing and still go through.
I think the user should just exclude packets necessary for
swapping from queueing manually, based on IP addresses,
port numbers or something like that.
