Subject: [PATCH] Define wc_wmb, a write barrier for PCI write combining
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/24/347

On some platforms, a regular wmb() is not sufficient to guarantee that
PCI writes have been flushed to the bus if write combining is in effect.
This change introduces a new macro, wc_wmb(), that makes this guarantee.
It does so by way of a new header file, <linux/system.h>.  This header
can be a site for oft-replicated code from <asm-*/system.h>, but isn't
just yet.
We also define a version of wc_wmb() with the required semantics
on x86_64.
