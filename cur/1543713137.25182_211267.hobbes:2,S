I'm looking for some pointers as to why this is happening.
I have a machine with 2.4.25/2.6.4 (boots over network) that serves 2 hard
disks to my network.
It has a microstar ms-6163 systemboard (I think that's the right number), a
160gb maxtor as hda.  hda contains an ext3 filesystem.  Nic is a 3c905b with
MBA.  256mb memory.  700mhz (100fsb) pIII.
Reading a 2.9gb file off hda is took 1:51 minutes (~26mb/sec).
When I do this over nfs, it takes over 8 minutes (~5.7mb/sec).
I used to get around 11mb/sec transfer from this machine.  The changes I
made was a different board/cpu/memory/kernel version and used an 80wire ide
cable for hda.  The nic is the same, hda is the same.
The old machine was a celeron 333a, 40wire ide cable, 192mb ram.  I don't
know what the board model was.  With the old board, I saw about 32mb/sec on
the same file (local) and 11mb/sec (nfs).  The kernel was 2.4.20.
Does anyone have any ideas?  I looked at ifconfig, vmstat, /proc/interrupts
but nothing looks out of the ordinary.
I almost want to just downgrade the machine, but i like the microstar board
better (faster cpu).
