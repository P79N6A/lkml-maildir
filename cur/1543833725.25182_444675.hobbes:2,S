What if the admin *wants* non-root users to have good quality audio, and
just doesn't want them to crash the system (voluntarily and especially
accidentally). Enforcing CPU limits *is* possible and it has already
been done independently by both Ingo and Con. I'm just waiting for the
feature to be available out-of-the box, which is not for today if kernel
space keeps pointing at userspace and vice versa. :-(
