Of course you can't take a reference to a vma, so to pin a vma you need
the mmap_sem, and to do that you need to drop i_mmap_lock, which means
your vma might go away ;)
So I think you really do need to get back to the mm, and then search its
vmas.
Also, a down_write_trylock attempt inside i_mmap_lock should be a valid
optimisation.
