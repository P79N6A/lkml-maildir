I understand your feelings about this, and as you probably understand, the
kfree / vfree thingy is a result of the above allocation scheme.
The allocated memory holds an array of struct page pointers. The number of
struct page pointers will range from 1 to about 8192, so the alloc size
will range from 4bytes to 64K, but could go higher depending on
architecture. I figured that kmalloc could fail, and, according to "linux
device drivers" (IIRC), vmalloc is faster when allocation size exceeds 1
page. Using only vmalloc waists far too much memory if the number of small
buffers is high.
So we can't use only vmalloc, and we can't fail so we can't use only
kmalloc. I'm open to suggestions on how to improve this.
