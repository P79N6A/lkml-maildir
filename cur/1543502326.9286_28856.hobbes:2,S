This is in 2.2.10, right? update is still with us on my machine - has been
alive for the last 6 days. It must be a problem somewhere in parts of the
kernel that I don't use. 
Filesystems in use on my machine is msdos, vfat, ext2fs, iso9660 (joilet
and rockridge) and procfs. 
What do you have that I don't? 
Cheers, 
Alex
