Well, that's what it says right underneath the line in devices.txt which
says:
	**** DEVICE DRIVERS AUTHORS PLEASE READ THIS ****
It goes on to say...
"Third, please don't assume that the distributed version of the list is
up to date.  Due to the number of registrations I have to maintain it
in "batch mode", so there is likely additional registrations that
haven't been listed yet."
