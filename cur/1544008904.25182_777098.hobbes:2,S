It shouldn't be necessary...
Shane, you can use helpers from <linux/ata.h> just fine in IDE host drivers
so looking at what libata-core helper used by ata_piix.c:
        if (ata_pio_need_iordy(adev))
                control |= 2;   /* IE enable */
is actually doing:
unsigned int ata_pio_need_iordy(const struct ata_device *adev)
{
        /* Controller doesn't support  IORDY. Probably a pointless check
           as the caller should know this */
        if (adev->link->ap->flags & ATA_FLAG_NO_IORDY)
                return 0;
        /* PIO3 and higher it is mandatory */
        if (adev->pio_mode > XFER_PIO_2)
                return 1;
        /* We turn it on when possible */
        if (ata_id_has_iordy(adev->id))
                return 1;
        return 0;
}
we see that all you need to add in your driver is an additional checking
for ata_id_has_iordy().
Thanks,
Bart
PS when it comes to actually setting the transfer mode on the device
(done in ide_config_drive_speed() core function) IORDY is also handled
just fine (thanks to Sergei).
