Can you tell the xbox by the subsystem id on the root bridges ?

It isnt actually alone in that - 2.5 probably makes that pretty easy to
accomodate. We have subtrees for x86 variants as a patch set now and used
for the voyager platform. The newer IBM and certain other vendor "big x86"
boxes are pretty weird probably weirder than X-box 8)

Ok. Thats true of some embedded x86 too

The latest code has a kbd_present function. That lets you add the logic
you need.

Probably. I suspect the primary questions are political/lawyer ones rather than
technical ones. Things like the IDE drive password are touchy obviously
but that can be done from an initrd loaded with the kernel I guess.

IMHO yes.

Yes - you should probably aim at 2.5 for merging rather than 2.4 however, 
especially for things like the FATX file system work.
