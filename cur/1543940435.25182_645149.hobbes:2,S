Among other things, yes. But SCSI standards also specify electrical 
interfaces that aren't at all related to the electrical interfaces used by 
a lot of devices, and a lot of the places the kernel uses the term suggest 
that it's also talking about the electrical interface (or, at least, 
connector shape). For example, it's misleading to talk about "SCSI CDROM 
support" meaning the command protocol when hardly anybody has ever seen a 
CDROM drive that doesn't use the SCSI command protocol, but most people 
know about both SCSI-connector and PATA-connector CDROM drives.
