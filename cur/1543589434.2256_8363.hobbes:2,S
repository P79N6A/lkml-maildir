What Mobo/CPUs?  I have a Tyan Tiger SD1692DL (I _think_ that's the model, I
haven't checked in ages tho) with 2 P2/333 (Deschutes).  2.4.0,2.4.1,2.4.2 and
2.4.3-pre3 (reiserfs patches) have worked great for me.  2.4.3-pre3 was
up for 16days before I rebooted into 2.4.4 (and power killed another 10+ day
uptime).
