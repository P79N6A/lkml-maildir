Mark,
I bet you won't get any replies (besides mine). And yes this means that you
will have to enable cpusets if Peter's patches go in (looks like they will).
Hot-plug may not be needed unless I convince people to reuse the hot-plug
instead of introducing new notifiers.
I guess we can make some extensions to expose "system" bit just like I did
with "isolated" bit via sysfs. In which case cpusets may not be needed. We'll see.
