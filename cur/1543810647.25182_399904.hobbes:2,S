I absolutely agree with what you say. HOWEVER hal is also terminally
broken. The thing they depend on is a *config option*. If they can't
deal with that config option not being enabled in a graceful way, that's
a series malfunction.
(and no this is not an excuse for breaking userspace ABIs at all,
although one can argue that this removing is almost the same as
disabling the config option)
