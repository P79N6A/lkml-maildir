Hey Nick,
Was this tested against single processor?  On my Dell Latitude C810 I
can boot test9 and test9-mm2 without problems, but using the identical
config with this patch my system will not even boot up all the way.  It
stops at various stages during the init scripts.  It seems to
consistently get further if I add elevator=deadline but it never boots
all the way up in either case.
No messages or other good info, just hangs and won't go any further. 
Any thoughts?
Later,
Tom
