I'd suggest changing the locking a bit.
Just make "clear_pci_errors()" take a spinlock on the bridge, and 
"read_pci_errors()" unlock it. We need to make sure that if multiple 
devices on the same bridge try to be careful, they can do so without 
seeing each others errors.
readX_check() itself would do no locking at all, since it is already 
called with the assumption that the bridge has been locked.
I'd also suggest that you make "clear_pci_errors()" return a cookie for 
read_pci_errors() to use. 
Also, I assume that the thing would support (and please make the
documentation clear on it) multiple IO operations between a
"clear_pci_errors()" and it's ending "read_pci_errors()" pair. I can well
imagine that a driver might do
	int get_data_buffer(struct pci_dev *dev, u32 *buf, int words)
	{
		int i;
		pci_error_t cookie;
		unsigned long offset = pci_resource_start(dev, 0) + DATA_OFFSET;
		cookie = clear_pci_errors(dev);
		/* Get the whole packet of data.. */
		for (i = 0; i < words; i++)
			*buf++ = readl_check(dev, offset);
		/* Did we have any trouble? */
		if (read_pci_errors(dev, cookie))
			return -EIO;
		/* All systems go.. */
		return 0;
	}
to read a "packet" of data from a device. Whatever.
