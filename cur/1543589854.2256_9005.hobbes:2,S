It is _much_ easier on everybody involved to just bail out and ask the user
(once!) to rebuild the configuration from scratch starting from the defaults.
If you support broken configurations in any way, your program is just
wildly guessing what they did mean. The exact (and very probably not in any
way cleanly thought out) behaviour in corner cases then becomes "the way
things work", and we end up in an unmaintainable mess yet again.
Please don't.
