	AFAIK, the 2.4.0 series does share memory, but it's just the
	counters that are not updated, for they are costly.

	This is the perfect time to ask one thing that I don't know,
	but that I've tried to find without success: what is the
	difference between "buffers" and "cached"? I'd make the wild
	guess that "buffers" would mean any types of buffers that the
	kernel maintains, while "cached" would have something to do
	with cached disk blocks...
	Are these guesses correct or completely, way off?
	Thanks for any hints, Roger...
