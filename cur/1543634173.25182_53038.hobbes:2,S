I can see one easy case: protocol has frame size of N. VMIN is set to
say 3 * N. read() supplies a buffer of N. The purpose being that the
first read will block until 3 frames are ready to process, then return
the first one. Your patch would break that.
Having said that, I don't know of any instances where the above is
employed. I'd say your patch is worthwhile.
