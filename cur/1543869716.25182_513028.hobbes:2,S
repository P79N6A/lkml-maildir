Hmm, exact the same evserver_epoll.c you downloaded works ok for me,
although yes, it is buggy in that regard that it does not contain socket
close when data is transferred.

I will try to check. In theory without _ET it should perfoem much worse,
but in practice its performance is essentially the same (the same applies 
to kevent without KEVENT_REQ_ET flag - since the same socket almost never 
is used several times, it is purely zero overhead to have or not have that 
flag set).

Ok, right now I'm compiling kevent/threadlet tree on my test machines.
