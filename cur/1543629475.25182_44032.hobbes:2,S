Did you check /proc/slabinfo? The 6th column lists the number of 4KB
pages used by each 'slabcache'. The following script shows meminfo as
well as the 2 (typically) large slab-users.

#!/bin/sh
cat /proc/meminfo
awk '/^inode_cache/ {printf("Inode slab:\t%6d kB\n", 4 * $6);} /^dentry_cache/ {printf("Dentry slab:\t%6d kB\n", 4 * $6);}' < /proc/slabinfo
