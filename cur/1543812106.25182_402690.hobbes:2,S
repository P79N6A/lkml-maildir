This I know. My beef is the readability of:
if (do_dma)
    *dev->dma_mask = DEVICE_DMA_MASK;
else
    *dev->dma_mask = 0;
I.e. we use dma_mask even though we don't do DMA.

wbsd isn't the issue, sdhci is. PCI sets a 32-bit mask by default so I
end up with highmem pages even when I'm not doing DMA.
