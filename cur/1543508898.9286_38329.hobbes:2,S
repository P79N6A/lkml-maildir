That's true, though as I and others have already argued, a shorter
development cycle would be a natural result of not back-porting features.
But wait! With the status quo, we already have to wait months or years to
get working features such as RAID and NFS. I'd rather wait months than
years.

That is certainly a disadvantage, but no worse than the current problem
with RAID and NFS. The main advantages of having to patch for new hardware
over having to patch for bugs are 1) the number of patches needed in the
former case is small and constant while in the latter case the number of
patches needed grows without bounds and 2) only new hardware and the rare
systems needing new kernel features need to be patched.
