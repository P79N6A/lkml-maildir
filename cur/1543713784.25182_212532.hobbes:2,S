No, the schedule() fastpath doesn't use find_next_bit. That is
only used to traverse the runqueues when moving tasks from one
to another. No problem uninlining it there.
If the function is more than a cacheline or two big, you'll
probably get better performance through better cache utilisation
anyway, and you'll be able to use a slightly larger, faster
version if you have one, which is probably a good thing.
Unless there is something specific that I'm not aware of?
