I take that back. :)
Vladis, would you still try that patch to see if it helps?

In my rush to finish up for dinner, I fat-fingered the droptick code
(forgot the static!) so I wasn't ever get timer ticks. :(
Then after I fixed that, I noticed long-ish stalls starting X or
switching between X and VT consoles. However after digging into it I
realized the issue is that xtime is only being updated every 100 ticks,
and nanosleep used xtime (via hrtimers), so it was getting the extra
100tick latency on every call.
So just to be fair, I double checked the following patch against
mainline, saw the hang Vladis was seeing, then applied it to my earlier
patch along with this patch and the system booted fine w/ no stalls.
thanks
