I wanted to know if my VMs were being locked correctly so I through
together this patch for /proc/pid/maps it overloads the read bit with a
capital R for read/locked and an l for non-read/locked..
I'm not sure if this or something like it could be included maybe I'd be
better off overloading the p/s bit with P/S .. or adding a locked field
(didn't like that idea as it might mess up the layout..)..
Dave.
