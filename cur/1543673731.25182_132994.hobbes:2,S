 and put a taskset call in your rc.d
Ah. I think I misread your previous note to me on this...that's why my patch 
modifies init itself (it does not muck with the syscall in any way). I'll try 
this as soon as I have my 2.5 multiprocessor back. BTW: what are the plans 
for getting schedutils (and specifically taskset) into a normal 2.6-based 
distribution? Can I be reasonably sure that this will happen?
