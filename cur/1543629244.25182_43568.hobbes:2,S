Type safety, it's also easier to read and edit.

There is u32 or u8, which is usually used in the kernel. In user space
you can map them to whatever you like.

It might be useful for other things, e.g. for using something more
efficient than do_gettimeofday.

You already have this above the function and it describes the return
value at single place and not all over the function.

IMO most comments are too obvious, I think it would be useful to
describe the more general things (e.g. like locking strategies) at a
single place and comments in functions should concentrate more on the
nonobvious stuff.

As soon as I need it. :)
BTW to make it easier for other people to review your patch, I suggest
you include a direct link next time. Splitting the patch in a core part
and tracepoints part also helps reading the patch.
