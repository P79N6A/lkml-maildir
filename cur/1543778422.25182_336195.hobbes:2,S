Is USB loaded? It'll do 1000 interrupts per second if it is. I'm not sure if
this still is the case on 2.6.13-rc3, please check your /proc/interrupts
to see the rate at which interrupt counters are increasing.

This almost looks like a regular Athlon 64, not even the mobile version.
I wouldn't expect very big deep sleep capabilities on that one. You can
check the 
	/proc/acpi/processor/CPU1/power
file for the list of C states. A normal Athlon64 will likely have only
C0. Mobile chips can go up to C4, which is really deep sleep.
