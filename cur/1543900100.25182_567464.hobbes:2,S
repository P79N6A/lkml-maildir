Hello i have a problem with my ASUS p5b mobo, i am a gentoo user and i'm
getting this error while booting my system from newest gentoo-sources
2.6.22 (this also happens on earlier ver. of kernel) i get this message:
"PCI: BIOS Bug: MCFG area at f0000000 is not E820-reserved
PCI: Not using MMCONFIG."
and i dunno how can this be fixed, i can start to boot my kernel with
nommconf but i don' like to have problems like that, and maybe some of
you ppl have a better solution for this problem?
