 ".code16gcc" is useable since a bit earlier than that, in fact since:
http://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2000-04/msg00021.html
 has been fixed, I am using it every other day.

 Yes it is, and there is a lot of work in those 33 patch; in very few of
them I would have liked to read something like "inspired by ..." in one of
the C comments (no need to add any E-mail, I already receive enough spam).
