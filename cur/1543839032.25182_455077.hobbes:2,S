The Altix NUMA interconnect has the same speed as far as I can recall as 
Hypertransport. It is the distance (real physical cable length) that 
creates latencies for huge systems. Sadly the Hypertransport is designed 
to stay on the motherboard. Hypertransport can only be said to be fast 
because its only used for tinzy winzy systems of a few processors. Are 
you saying that the design limitations of Hypertransport are an 
advantage?
