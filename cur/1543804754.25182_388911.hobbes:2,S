In order to "support" AMD X2 systems, it was necessary to revamp the
kernel's internal timekeeping.  How are we expected to deal with vendors
who break backwards compatibility on a deep level like this?
So basically a "stable kernel" means no new hardware support, which
basically means it's dead from the development POV - who would want to
work on such a thing?
