one of the 'killer features' of zfs is that it does checksums of every 
file on disk. so many people don't consider the disk infallable.
several other filesystems also do checksums
both bitkeeper and git do checksums of files to detect disk corruption
as david C points out there are many points in the path where the data 
could get corrupted besides on the platter.
