Okay. Here is the final version (hopefully). I moved atomic_t to
end of the structure. I still see 96-bytes for x86-64 also :(
buffer_head        40425  40760     96   40    1 : tunables  120   60
8 : slabdata   1019   1019      0
Thanks,
Badari
Increase the size of the buffer_head b_size field for 64 bit
platforms.  Update some old and moldy comments in and around
the structure as well.
The b_size increase allows us to perform larger mappings and
allocations for large I/O requests from userspace, which tie
in with other changes allowing the get_block_t() interface to
map multiple blocks at once.
