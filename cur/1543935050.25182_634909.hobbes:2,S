No, no.  You didn't understand the question.
What about people who want to suspend to RAM instead of hibernating and
_do_ want to unplug the USB device containing their root filesystem
while the machine is asleep?  In this case we will _know_ that the
power session has been interrupted, but USB Persist won't activate
because the host controller never lost power.
