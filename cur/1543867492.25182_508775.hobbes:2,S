They've not had the chance before and there are certain chains of them
which make huge amounts of sense because you don't want to keep taking
completion hits. Not so much looping ones but stuff like
	cork write sendfile uncork close
are very natural sequences.
There seem to be a lot of typical sequences it doesn't represent however
(consider the trivial copy case where you use the result one syscall into
the next)

They can each register their own async objects. They need to do this
anyway so that the libraries can use asynchronous I/O and hide it from
applications.

Do current users do this because that is all they have, because it is
hard, or because the current option is all that makes sense ?
The ability to avoid asynchronous completion waits and
complete/wake/despatch cycles is a good thing of itself. I don't know if
it justifies the rest but it has potential for excellent performance.
