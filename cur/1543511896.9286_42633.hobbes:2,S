Hot swapping PCMCIA is the whole point of PCMCIA, if you do not
support that there is no reason to refer to PCMCIA support at
all. It's like saying that one should switch off a laptop instead of
doing suspend to disk.
Now, how can it be that a silly thread like this can result in so many
replies even in $#$#@ private email on the subject. If all this energy
was spent on hacking code instead we would be well ahead of anybody
else.
