There are some details in error in this document, and the discussion of
cache-coherence might be expanded or dropped altogether, rather than hinted
at.  I've sent a long note to the author with "diffs' for a next edition.
Thanks for pointing it out, I know of several situations in which it will be
useful to point people at it.
