I can understand that you want this one. I do not think uglyness is
worth it, through.

Use sysrq-X as you do during runtime.

Usefull for developing swsusp but not for using it. Should live as a
separate patch.

This is prety much nonsensical. You can do echo reboot > disk. If you
forget to do it, all you have to do is press power after it powers
down. That's about as much work as pressing 'R' while you are
suspending, right?
Please drop this one.
