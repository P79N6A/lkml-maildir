Do you have some docs to that effect? All that's been presented to me so far is a standard, one port controller with a mux in front of it. Under that definition, all controllers support an infinite number of cards.

I'm afraid empirical data is insufficient. Show me a data sheet saying that OMAP controllers are designed in accordance with the newer MMC specs and I'll be happy.
And you'll have to do a lot better than that to convince me that older OMAP controllers are designed for standards that were written after the chips were released (i.e. high speed bus timings).
