I'v got problem with ide-scsi driver in 2.4.20, when I put that module in
kernel it recognizes my drives as SCSI - good, but when I have more than
one drive that can be emulated,i.e. CD-RW & DVD creates 16 scsi devices in
/dev - /dev/sr(0-15). Devices from 0-7 are master on ribbon, and 8-15
secondary. I can access devices as usual. One more thing that when I have
CD-RW and normal CD-R it recognizes one device wihich is cdrecorder, cdrom
I can access as normal IDE device. That's all ;-) 
HW info:
MB: MSI 854PE Max
HDD: Seagate Barracuda IV 40GB
CD-RW: LG 48/12/48 HL-ST-8040B
CD-R: LG 52x
P.S: Sorry for that previous message was without Subject
