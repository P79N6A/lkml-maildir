Little by little, ivtv is being merged into V4L.  There is a lot of 
reorganization that is taking place, and it is not a very fast process.
As of 2.6.15-rc1, many of the modules from ivtv were merged into the 
kernel through V4L.  Recently, there was another ivtv fork discovered, 
called paken.  (for better details, see ivtv mailing list archives)  The 
ivtv guys are currently working on cleaning up the main ivtv module, and 
merging in the code from the paken repo.  When all is ready, it will all 
be merged into v4l, and eventually the kernel.
Cheers,
