it varies, but generally an oops (due to a NULL dereference) will occur in
the file system routines or during exit clean-up processing.
turns out, no global lock is necessary in do_brk(); both the
merge_segments() and insert_vm_struct() calls are OK to do in that case
without the global lock.  it's the general cases that appear in routines
like mremap() that still need protection.  i just didn't optimize the
do_brk() case as far as i could have.
