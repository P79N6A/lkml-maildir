Matt,
Well I looked at it on the weekend and didn't see anything.
Unfortunately I don't have any USB devices or IDE cdroms
in the right place to replicate your configuration.
I guess the problem revolves around calling  
remove_proc_entry() with the appropriate
arguments bottom up for the subtree you wish to
delete from procfs.
One way that I have noticed that you can see
that remove_proc_entry() is working is to
place the cwd in a procfs directory belonging
to driver you are about to rmmod. [For example:
'cd /proc/scsi/sg ; rmmod sg']. When the rmmod
is done the kernel spits out a message like:
   remove_proc_entry: scsi/sg busy, count=1
When I back out of that directory the kernel outputs:
   de_put: deferred delete of sg
Hope this helps.
