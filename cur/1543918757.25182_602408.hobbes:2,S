Too bad. If this would work then I would have a load to work against. I 
have a patch here that may address the issue for SMP (no NUMA for now) by 
batching all frees on the per cpu freelist and then dumping them in 
groups. But it is likely not too wise to have you run your weeklong 
tests on this one. Needs some more care first.
