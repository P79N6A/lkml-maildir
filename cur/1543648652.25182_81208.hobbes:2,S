Yes. serial98.c is based on 8250.c. And we add codes for emulating.
Old PC-9800 has 8251 USART. Newer PC-9801 has both 16550A and 8251 like
custom chip. Its custom chip is enhanced for support up to 115.2kbps and
 has FIFO. 
On kernel 2.1.x to 2.4.x, based on serial.c version are working well.
But It's ugly code, I think too. :)
