No, sorry, that was over ppp over rfcomm. With MSI dongle, I get
25KB/sec with n6230. With bluetooth CF card, I only get 10KB/sec.

Rest is during transfer. I'd expect it to be slightly worse, but not
that bad.

This is against second linux box... Can't be the phone.

Do you prefer hcidump on MSI or on billionton side? On MSI side it is
easy to get, but it is generating *big* logs.
