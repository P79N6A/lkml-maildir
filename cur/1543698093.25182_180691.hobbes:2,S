Does anyone have modem working in 2.6.0-test11?
I have external modem connected to /dev/ttyS0 (COM1).  Kernel
2.6.0-test11 give me
    Failed to open /dev/modem: No such device
where /dev/modem is symlink to /dev/ttyS0.  I've looked at
/proc/interrupts and /proc/ioports, and I can't find any mention of
irq=4 or io=3f8 which are the normal settings that I use.
No problem in kernel-2.4.23, though.
