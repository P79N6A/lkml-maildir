I have users who need this:
set the following in  /usr/src/linux/include/asm/shmparam.h                                                             
SHMMAX  128MB                                                                                                           
SHMMIN     1                                                                                                            
SHMMNI     100                                                                                                          
SHMSEG      10                                                                                                          
and following in    /usr/src/linux/inlude/linux/sem.h                                                                   
SEMMNI       100                                                                                                        
SEMMSL       60                                                                                                         
SEMMNS      110                                                                                                         
SEMOPM       100                                                                                                        
SEMVMX      32767                                                                                                       
then recompile and install.
Is there a way to pass these values via append, or anything other than
having a one-off custom kernel config?
:wq!
