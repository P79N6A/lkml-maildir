What about using different dirtypage limits for different processes?
--- i.e. every process has dirtypage activity counter, that is increased 
when it dirties a page and decreased over time. Compute the limit for 
process as some inverse of this counter --- so that processes that dirtied 
a lot of pages will be blocked at lower limit and processes that dirtied 
few pages will be blocked at higher limit.
The main problem is that if the user extracts tar archive, tar eventually 
blocks on writeback I/O --- O.K. But if bash attempts to write one page to 
.bash_history file at the same time, it blocks too --- bad, the user is 
annoyed.
(I don't have time to write and test it, it is just an idea --- I found 
these writeback lockups of the whole system annoying too)
