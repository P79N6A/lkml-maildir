Rik...
I *wish* it were that simple.  If you don't think that a least some of us 
*try*, you're kidding yourself.  The real problem, IMHO, is that the 
electorate of our country no longer has any real power or control over the 
government -- it's the corporations that do.  Money talks, so the saying 
goes.  He who has the gold makes the rules.
So, please don't punish all of us for the acts of our corrupt system.  We 
just try to make it better in whatever ways we can.  FWIW, the ACLU, EEF, 
etc. are our best hope for a free society.
Thanks
