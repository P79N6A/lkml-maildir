	Doh!  You're right of course.  Setting it to size (0x1000000) worked
fine.  That leads me to another two questions if you have the time:
	My X server has this line for video ram:
(--) SVGA: PCI: NVidia Riva TNT rev 4, Memory @ 0xe4000000, 0xe6000000
	Does this mean I should have two 8 meg MTRR entries at those base
addresses or just ignore the first one?  
	And secondly I noticed when I use the VESA fb console, it works fine,
however when it tries to automatically set the MTRR at the 0xe6000000 base
address it incorrectly tries to use size 0xff0000 like I was doing before and
gets the same error.  This would appear to be a bug.   I know you didn't write
this part of the kernel, but since I'm carboning this to the kernel list I
figured I'd mention it in case it was significant.
	Thanks for the clue!
