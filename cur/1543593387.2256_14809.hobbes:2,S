In some cases, it definitely is.  I can routinely improve throughput
by writing more.. that is a measurable and reproducable fact.  I know
also from measurement that it is not _always_ the right thing to do.

(I would hope that we're doing our best to always be writing real data
to disk.  I also know that this isn't always the case.)

That is not the case here at the spot in the performance curve I'm
looking at (transition to throughput).
Does this mean the block layer and/or elevator is having problems?  Why
would using avaliable disk bandwidth vs letting it lie dormant be a
generically bad thing?.. this I just can't understand.  The elevator
deals with seeks, the vm is flat not equipped to do so.. it contains
such concept.
Avoiding write is great, delaying write is not at _all_ great.
