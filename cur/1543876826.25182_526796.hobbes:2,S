The application that does madvise(MADV_WHATEVER_MEANS_KENREL_CAN_DROP)
doesnt care. It it cares, it would use munmap(), or no syscall at all.

Then an application that cares of passwd wont use 
madvise(MADV_WHATEVER_MEANS_I_DONT_CARE)
;)
Maybe I was not clear, but I was refering to a pool of 'discardable' pages, 
that would be feeded by applications that want to notify kernel some pages can 
be completly discarded (contains no security data of course, nor data that the 
applications dont want to forget), and might be given to a consumer without 
the need of zeroing it.
We might make this pool private to each process, but then it would benefit to 
less workloads I guess...
