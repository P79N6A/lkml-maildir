Hi Kumar,

It should be for pq1, pq2 and pq2pro. However, i only have the possibility
to test this on pq1.

These are the parts needed to boot a device with activated watchdog. If a 
bootloader like u-boot activates the watchdog, it can't be deactivated again
and needs to be reset at regular intervals. This is done using a kernel timer.
The driver in drivers/watchdog disables the timer as soon as the wdt device
is opened.
Thanks,
Jochen
