This likely just drove Srivatsa up a wall (sorry), as my comments
in the earlier thread he referenced:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/26/58
enthusiastically supported adding a cpu controller interface to cpusets.
We need to think through what are the relations between CKRM
controllers, containers and cpusets.  But I don't think that
people will naturally want to manage CKRM controllers via cpusets.
That sounds odd to me now.  My earlier enthusiasm for it seems
wrong to me now.
