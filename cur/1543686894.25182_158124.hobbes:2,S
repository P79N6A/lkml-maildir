I like the ideas that the patch seems to propose.
Infact I'd like to see the use of xattr used for non-standard attributes
applied to all fs.
Specifically, I want to backup all partitions, and attribs from one OS:
Linux. I do not want to loose fat attributes during backup.
This would also be useful for the Wine developers.
If you haven't got a response to your questions, maybe make your own 
decisions and submit a patch anyway.
One question:
How does the patch deal with the fact that only some named xattrs are
permitted?
I see 2 options:
1. all files/dirs in fat mount posess fat-specific xattrs. These xattrs 
are initialised at file/dir create. No further attribs can be added, 
none can be deleted. the fat attribute's Boolean value is defined by 
extended attribute's value.
2. all fat-specific attribs are optional, absence/presence defines
boolean value. All operations are permitted, but can only add the
fat-specific attributes.
I prefer option 1, as it makes clear what attributes are available.
