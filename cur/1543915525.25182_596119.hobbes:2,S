Good point. I thought it might come up, especially for 16 bits mov that
can be expressed under different forms, one of which has a prefix. I
would like to go for Peter's suggestion: putting the label _after_ the
instruction, since we know that we will be right after the immediate
value, but it has a drawback: we cannot insure correct alignment of the
immediate value in that case. But that would help not having to force
the register.

Actually, no, since the initial value is written to the immediate value
references at early boot and at module load time. I originally thought
passing the referenced variable to it, but, as I recall, it brought
linker issues when the symbol was defined in another module. So yes,
just $0 is ok, I'll change that.

Yes, this one is tricky.. trying to align efficiently something on a 4
bytes address - 1 is not what gas is used to help doing.

At least we will have at most 3 nops there.
