The Thinkpad linux webpages mention : suspend, swap device, unsuspend.
I suspect there is a BIOS function that handles the device change,
since that is where the suspend actually occurs.  Windows must call it
directly.  Hotplugging is for the standard interfaces, the thinkpad
Ultrabay is unique.  You should probably be asking the IBM linux
group.
