Oh I see.
Well, xfree86 and other programs aren't going to look there, so
something had to be done about the existing /proc/bus/pci/* hierarchy.
To be honest, xfree86 needs the controller information not for the
sake of device probing, it needs it to detect resource conflicts.
Anyways, I agree with your change, sure.
