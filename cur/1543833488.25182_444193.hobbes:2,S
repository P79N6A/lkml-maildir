Are you using SMP?  We have a known slab locking bug.
There have been a couple of slab.c patches committed today, but neither of
them appear to actually fix the bug.
The below should fix it, and testing this (disable lockdep) would be
useful.
It's going to take a bit of work to unpickle it all now.
