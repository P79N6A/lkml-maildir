It's still a patch for more political purposes than technical ones.
See my other message -- when the Just Works(tm) value is high enough, we 
can use the kernel firmware loader, and the firmware will be outside the 
driver source code.
But since using the firmware loader _right now_ would kill 
loader-unaware situations like the installer or "kickstart", it's not 
feasible.
