We cannot do this without the reporters permission. Often we get
material that even the list isn't allowed to directly see only by
contacting the relevant bodies directly as well. The list then just
serves as a "foo should have told you about issue X" notification.
If you are setting up the list also make sure its entirely encrypted
after the previous sniffing incident.
