Subject: mem=options changed in 2.6.x?

I have a Compaq Proliant 5000 with 320Mb RAM.
If I boot up either linux 2.4.22 or 2.6.4, it only identifies 12Mb of memory.
With 2.4.22, the kernel parameters "mem=exactmap mem=640k@0M mem=319M@1M"
worked to make the kernel identify all of the memory.
I have tried the same with linux 2.6.4, but with the above flags the
kernel will not boot.  With "mem=320M", the system boots, but it still
thinks it has only 12Mb RAM.
Something I'm missing or did this change between releases?
Thanks in advance,
