there's not much we can do about them: the ACPI code doesnt measure 
their idle time, right? This is mostly for statistics purposes, so 
unless "broken" means tons of boxes, we dont have to have 100% coverage.

how much is "a lot" in C1? There's an AMD TSC-slows-down-C1 erratum but 
that should be less than 1%. (which is fine enough for idle time 
measurements)

i'm not opposed to the idle notifiers but iirc the idle notifiers caused 
problems in themselves so part of them were reverted. We can do this 
more cleanly in .24 - it will make the benefits of the notifier cleanup 
even more apparent.
