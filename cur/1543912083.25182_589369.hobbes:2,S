This EDAC patch set was applied against: 2.6.23-rc3
Two fix patches:
1) When EDAC Debug is turned on, the debug statements
issue printk level of EMERG. This was corrected to issue
a level of DEBUG
2) e752x driver, instead of returning ENOMEM if a device
was not present, the correct value of ENODEV is returned
