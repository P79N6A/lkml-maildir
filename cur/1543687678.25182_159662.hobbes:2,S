AMD is 1 because there's no need to balance within a node, so I want the 
inter-node balance frequency to be as often as it was with just O(1).  This 
interval would not work well with other NUMA boxes, so that's the main reason 
to have arch specific intervals.  And, as a general guideline, boxes with 
different local-remote latency ratios will probably benefit from different 
inter-node balance intervals.  I don't know what these ratios are, but I'd 
like the kernel to have the ability to change for one arch and not affect 
another.

That has concerned me, too.  So far I haven't been able to see a measurable 
difference either way (within noise level), but it's possible.  The other 
alternative is to sum up node load at sched_best_cpu and find_busiest_node.

I just went off the toplogy already there, so I left it.

OK, thanks!
