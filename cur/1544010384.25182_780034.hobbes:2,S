Yes, that would take care of it.  My original workaround was to disable 
CONFIG_KMOD.  I only have a few modules compiled (for servers that 
require those modules), but most of my servers don't need any modules. 
This would allow me to manually load modules myself and never have to 
worry about the kernel forking stuff in userspace.  Unfortunately, it 
appears that CONFIG_KMOD is being deprecated soon and I didn't want to 
rely on it.
What is the core reason for removing CONFIG_KMOD?  I personally would 
rather have the choice as to whether my kernel tries to find its own 
modules or not.
