actually the opposite is true, on a 2.2 GHz P4:
  $ ./lat_sig catch
  Signal handler overhead: 3.091 microseconds
  $ ./lat_ctx -s 0 2
  2 0.90
ie. *process to process* context switches are 3.4 times faster than signal
delivery. Ie. we can switch to a helper thread and back, and still be
faster than a *single* signal.
signals are in essence 'lightweight' threads created and destroyed for the
purpose of a single asynchronous event, it's IMO a very inefficient and
baroque concept for almost anything (but debugging and a number of very
special uses). I'd guess that with a sane threading library a helper
thread is faster for almost everything.
