That's not really true, I include in the list EXT3_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_*, 
EXT3_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_*, 32-bit uid/gid, ISTR some ACL-related mess, and 
the online resizing stuff that produces a filesystem slightly different 
than what mke2fs would produce for the same [larger] sized block device. 
  Red Hat has had at least one problem in the past where users were 
annoyed at format changes (htree?).
I certainly grant that extents and 48bit are format changes on a -much- 
larger scale than in the past.  Absolutely.
That's why I feel that this is a good point to calm down ext3 
development, and start putting stuff like extents into ext4.  If we are 
starting to make major changes to the format, that should be a signal 
that we are starting to work on a new filesystem, rather than patching 
an old one.
I disagree with the "years to stabilize ext4" argument, because we are 
starting from a known good point.  I think ext4 will be easier to 
maintain and tune for modern storage systems, if we don't have to worry 
as much about that stuff for ext3.
