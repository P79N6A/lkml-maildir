Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Fair group scheduler - various fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello Ingo and Andrew,
	Here are various patches to fair group scheduler code present in
sched-devel and in 2.6.23-rc7-mm1. These patches should apply against
both sched-devel git tree and 2.6.23-rc7-mm1 (as they are both in sync
now).
Pls consider for inclusion after review.
[there is still room for improving group fairness obtained on smp
systems. By sending out these patches, i am hoping more folks can test
and improve that aspect]
Ingo,
	You may want to avoid picking Patch 5/5 as it makes sense only in
-mm tree atm.
