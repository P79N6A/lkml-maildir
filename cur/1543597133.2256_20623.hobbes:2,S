Thanks for owning up to that line!  I see your point.
I fear that most values found on the stack and within the vmalloc address
range would actually turn out to be valid addresses.  We probably should
not re-enable show_trace() on module text without something (in vm_struct?)
to distinguish module text from data, bss, and from other uses of vmalloc.
