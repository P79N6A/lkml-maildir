Yes sure. But could you explain why this can be bad given that ptracing
init needs the explicit boot parameter? IOW, could you explain why you
don't like this small and trivial change which adds a minimal impact ?
Most of the lkml readers can easily implement most of debugging options,
do you mean there are useless? I personally like the possibility to trace
init without re-compiling the kernel, because I'd like to know why /usr/bin/top
sometimes shows init at the top.
