I suppose you could make similiar claims. However, there is a very
important and subtle difference.  MontaVista is NOT in any position to
tell developers using 'MontaVista' kernels that they must STOP using our
kernel, since it is GPL'ed.
Bitmover, however, is VERY MUCH in a position to tell developers to STOP 
using Bitkeeper. As a matter of fact, it's in your license.

But potentially not for 6 months, during which time the use of bitkeeper 
is legally dubious, and probably not possible without altering the binary 
(i.e., if openlogging.org goes down), opening up another mess.

If you don't stick around, OR get unhappy with us using BK, we have a 
problem. Yes, you have some very nice fallbacks, which I thank you for, 
but the fallbacks are still going to cause a great deal of pain.
The real problem is what if you have 300 kernel developers that suddenly 
start costing you support costs of $5,000 a month?
According to the license, that's only 4 months before the 'group of 
licensees' using BK for the kernel cost you $20,000, at which point the 
BKL allows you to cut them off.
If Bitmover ever has to tell someone to quit using BK under the BKL, that, 
IMHO, is a lose/lose situation, for everyone.
