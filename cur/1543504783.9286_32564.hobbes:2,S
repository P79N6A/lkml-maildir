Is EQL dead?  The kernel documentation hasn't been updated for 4 years,
and the eql_enslave package from metalab is in a.out format, linked
against libc4, and the source won't recompile.  Is it being handled in a
different manner, or is just so old that nobody wants to deal with it
any more?  If the former, shouldn't the docs be updated (I'll write if
someone will tell me how to use EQL); if the latter, then why is it
still in the kernel?
