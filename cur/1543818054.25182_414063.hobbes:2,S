Hi,
I am using redhate linux (kernel 2.4.20)
SCSI supports bidirectional data transfer. However, the two variants
request_bufflen and bufflen of a scsi_cmd are set to be the same in
the scsi_init_cmd_from_req(). I am wondering if i want to send and
receive data with different lengths, how do i pass the lengths to SCSI
layer? The scsi_wait_req() accepts only one length.... Can I make use
of extended CDB? Thanks!
