things went worse with the switch from 2.6.8 to 2.6.9-rc, so that's not
the nr_swap_pages > 0, likely the latest changes introduced regressions
instead of fixing them.
I'm seeing both hard deadlocks and suprious oom kills, and that all
makes sense, I can see the bugs, it's just I need to fix them, my plan
is to forward port some code from 2.4 which works fine, objrmap will make
it even better.
