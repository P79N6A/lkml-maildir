Any chance you could finally submit individual changes as patches /
changesets like everyone else does?  For the new primary sound driver
ALSA has quite a bit too much CVS mentality, these monthly or whatever
updates make it really hard to track individual changes and you have
a rather bad track record of backing out changes done in mainline
in the meantime..
