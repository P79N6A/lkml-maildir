No less is better. These are cycle counts. Hmmm... We discussed these 
cycle counts so much in the last week that I forgot to mention that.

There is a significant performance increase there. That is the main point 
of the patch.

There is a drawback because of the additional code introduced in the fast 
path. However, the regular kmalloc case shows improvements throughout. 
This is in particular of importance for SMP systems. We see an improvement 
even for 2 processors.

There is an #ifdef around ther per cpu structure management code. All of 
this will vanish (including the lookup of the per cpu address from the 
fast path) if SMP is off.
