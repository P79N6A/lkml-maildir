Overhead? Really you could save more memory by cleaning up a lot of 
drivers. Andi already said it before, there are better places to be 
looking at.
Also 'patching' for Athlon kernels doesn't cut it for people who need to 
distribute kernels which run on various hardware (such as distros). This 
alone is benefit enough to justify this supposed 'bloat'.
