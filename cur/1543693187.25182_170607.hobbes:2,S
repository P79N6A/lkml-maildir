Subject: PROBLEM (2.6.0-test6): loading cmd64x as module messes up primary IDE

Hi,
I have an SMP mainboard with two "standard" IDE controllers and a cmd649
as secondary interface. After booting, the kernel only sees the mainboard
interfaces, but that's what modules are for.
However, it is impossible to load the cmd64x module to access the second
interface because it apparently tries to re-acquire the primary IDE, which
is already claimed by the standard IDE driver. After this, access to
hda..hdd is impossible.

Kernel messages after inserting cmd64x (note that ide0+1 and hda..hdd are
already in use; I would expect to see ide2+ide3 and hde..hdh here; it also
sees the devices off ide0+ide1, not those actually connected to the cmd649):

Hints where to dig / patches are appreciated; I don't know my way round
the 2.6 device layer sufficiently well yet.
