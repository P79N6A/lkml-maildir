Well, the other cd drives exist in mainline outside that directory eg
drivers/block/paride/pcd.c  drivers/ide/ide-cd.c drivers/scsi/sr.c 
As far as I can see if this joins mainline it will be the only
proprietary CD device - there were six others which were
in /drivers/cdrom but they were purged recently.
I'm not bothered where it goes, though.
