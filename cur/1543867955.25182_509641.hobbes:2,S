The good news is that this kernel boots, so I can start testing. 
However, it seems to have a LOT of trouble coping with the idea that my 
only IDE device is a DVD burner. I am guessing from the hundreds of 
lines of nbd whining that nbd doesn't work, testing will continue after 
I go plow more snow.
If all this whining doesn't indicate a problem, I might suggest 
eliminating it, since it tends to hide any real problem.
compressed dmesg and config attached.
