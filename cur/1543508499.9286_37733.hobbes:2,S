You misread the patch.  The counting is purely optional, and I'll remove
it if people don't like it.  The really useful part of the patch is that
dmaable pages go on a separate list from non-dma.  It's a simple, obvious
extension of the existing mechanism that's easy to get right -- whereas
putting pages on the back of the list is going to be a lot more subtle.
