Hi,
I'm running 2.6.28 without problems.  I decided to give 2.6.29-rc2 a
try.  It crashes very early during boot, see screenshot, config and lspci
under 
http://apt.niif.hu/2.6.29-rc2/.
  CPU is AMD Athlon(tm) XP 1800+,
kernel command line: root=/dev/hda1 ro.  I fixed the pcf50663 compile
error by hand, and have a small patch on /drivers/acpi/battery.c, but
that module isn't loaded on this system.  I can hook up a serial
console for further info if needed.
