I'd just like to chime in that I recently did my own CD burning torture
tests under 2.2.0pre3 and everything worked out great.
scsi0 : BusLogic BT-946C
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: TEAC      Model: CD-R50S-000       Rev: 1.0E
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  (4x burn)
CPU: 2x PII 233 (196MB ram, IDE hard drives, Supermicro P6DBE mobo).
I burned a CD from an image with cdrecord, while compiling the kernel ala
"make -j3", while doing a "find / -xdev", while watching with a "vmstat 1"
while reading mail.
Never did the FIFO get below 97%. My mail console got sluggish every now
and then, but it didn't affect the cdrecord.
This is the first kernel since, oh, 2.1.~30 that I was able to do a
find/make/cdrecord at one time.
[off topic]
Now, I would like to just say something here: where I first started my
position at work, we were basically a SCO/Solaris shop. After a few years
of nagging and promises, last year I installed a Linux box on our heaviest
use machine, our proxy server :). Its 2.0.35 (RH5.1), running SOCKS5 and
FWTK (plus ipchains and some other networking stuff)
  3:12pm  up 118 days, 23:49,  0 users,  load average: 2.00, 2.01, 2.05
Prevously, our max uptime on this box was around 30 days or so using
Solaris 2.4. 
Not too shabby!!
Since then, well, ok, since everyone above me quit their jobs and made me,
by default, Senior <everything>, we have turned over to Linux except for
those apps that demand specific OS's (like BRS). I (and the
management/ownership) have been very pleased. Especially when I /proved/
to them that a $1000 linux box could outperform/out-uptime a $25,000 Sparc
running Solaris.
<itching for 2.2 to become stable for yet another batch of conversions!>
Keep up the good work folks!
G'day!
