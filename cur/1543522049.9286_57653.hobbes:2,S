   I am not sure if the linux slab allocator differs from the Solaris one in
   any significant way, but there is a writeup on the latter in Vahalia's 
   "UNIX Internals, the New Frontiers" (sec 12.10) and it references a 1994 
   paper by Bonwick:
      
http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/bos94/bonwick.html
   (passworded for USENIX members) 
For people's information, Usenix recently opened up its paper archives
so that all papers are freely available by all after one year.  So only
recently published papers require a Usenix membership/password for
access.  Apparently they haven't gotten around to fixing all of their
web pages, so when you look at the abstract page, it claims that you
need a Usenix membership to access it.  But if you click on the
postscript or ASCII link, it will Just Work and you'll be able to read
the paper.
