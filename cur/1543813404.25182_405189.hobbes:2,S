Tough break, that.  You sure you can't figure a way to either push the
floating point out to userspace, or do funky fixed-point math instead?

You can't find it because you can't do it.  It isn't as simple as linking
against libgcc - there's lots of other issues that make floating point
in the kernel Really Really Hard (for starters, it means you need to save
and restore the FP state across interrupts and scheduling within the kernel).

The right direction - either push it to userspace, or find a way to do it
with fixed point math.
