Hah, I suspected as much but didn't have a chance to look yet. I had
plans to replace that sub_if_list with an RCU list and not require the
lock there, but that's far off. Any ideas how to fix this? We can't
reject the master stop so we have to walk the list, I guess we'll have
to audit the other list manipulation places, I think they're all under
RTNL.
