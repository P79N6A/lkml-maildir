I seem to have isolated the changeset that causes my machines to have
very slow throughput, even as low as 2kB/s when tcp_window_scaling is
enabled.

[TCP]: TCP acts like it is always out of memory.

Stephen, David, could you review this changeset, figure out possible

Note that I am not saying that window_scaling is badly implemented,
but it just seems related.
