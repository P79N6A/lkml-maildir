I agree that do_drv_read()/write() should be converted to 
smp_function_call() (what it does is atomic: msr or PIO cycles).
Then work_on_cpu() can be removed for good, to not lure people into using 
it. You seem to agree that work_on_cpu() is unfixable so it's far better 
to offer nothing than to offer such a deceivingly named but fundamentally 
limited facility.
