Repeat after me:  plugins in kernel does NOT equal tools in kernel.
It's not hard to, for instance, imagine a generic plugin for archive
manipulation which talks to a userspace daemon/library.  The kernel
doesn't know anything other than (maybe) a list of extensions that are
archives.  All else is handled in userspace -- the idea that "this is a
zipfile" and "zipfiles can be extracted with the 'zip' command" are all
in userspace.
It's not about the kernel, it's about the interface.  And see my other mail:
	cat foo.zip/README
	less foo.zip/contents/bar.c
is a lot easier than
	lynx 
http://google.com/search?q=zip
	emerge zip
	man zip
	unzip foo.zip
	cat bar.c
which already assumes quite a lot of expertise.
