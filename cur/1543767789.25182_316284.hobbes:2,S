Indeed.  Line counts for the announcement e-mails for the 2.6.12-rc*-mm*:
2.6.12-rc1-mm1 2345
2.6.12-rc1-mm2 3048
2.6.12-rc1-mm3 2861
2.6.12-rc1-mm4 2612
2.6.12-rc2-mm1 2460
2.6.12-rc2-mm2 2610
2.6.12-rc2-mm3 2763
2.6.12-rc3-mm1 1236
2.6.12-rc3-mm2  105
2.6.12-rc3-mm3  796
(Presuming that the linecounts are at least roughly proportional to the
churn in patches added/merged/dropped).  The surprising thing for me this
time around was the 223 "merged upstream" patches - seemed a bit high for
this point in -rc3.  I admit *not* having looked at the list in detail and
they might all be minor bugfixes, or compared it to similar stages of
previous -rc3's.
And yes, it compiles and boots cleanly on my Dell laptop, for what that's worth. ;)
