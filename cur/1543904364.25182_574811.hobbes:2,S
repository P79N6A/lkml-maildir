OK, granted. But this is dummy code, and this is not what I'd expect 
checkpatch.pl to check for.

If someone writes the code this way, the problem is usually not the 
indentation that is most likely correct, but the fact that the code does 
something completely different from what the author thought it would do.
We already had such bugs in the kernel, they are unlikely to be spotted 
at code review, but for a script that looks at the source code they 
should be easy to spot.
