This is the idmac dmaengine driver I submitted a few weeks ago, that I am 
porting to your modified dmaengine framework. Initial version:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=122607472721145&w=2
BTW - it does look nicer and more simple now, so, in general, I like the 
change.

Ooh... Do you really think registering 32 dma-devices is a better solution 
than allowing non-equal dma-channels? As I explained in the commit 
comment, this is a specialised Image Processing DMA Controller, and each 
its channel has a fixed role. So, each client has to get a specific 
channel.

I assumed, that one wants to register the framebuffer as early as 
possible...
