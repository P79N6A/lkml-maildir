These are not dependencies but "only" the sequence of startup (and it is
not only Debian but also Fedora/RedHat, SuSE, Mandrake and probably all
except Gentoo).
Yuo get a much stricter ordering and sorting (and thus much simpler to
implement in a shell script).

This would be a win (especially if the numbers are tweked to tune this)
with a relatively small effort.
However for real dependencies and parallelism you want the info similar
to creat a Makefile from it (i.e. the explicit dependency from service X
to service Y). As a consequence you can get rid of the numbers (since
they are not needed any more).
