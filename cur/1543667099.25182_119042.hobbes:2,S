Yep, it's always mounted the same but the other thing I just remembered is 
that it's set up to use the automounter every time I go into /mnt/jaz.  So,
if I permenantly mount the jaz drive somewhere and just have /mnt/jaz be 
a intra-system link then it does work.  I guess this means it's a problem
with the jaz drive spinning down and "detaching" itself from the scsi bus?
I decided I would try it that way for the moment since I could then keep 
devfs on the system.  No oops but I'm sure if I unmounted it for about an
hour and then tried to mount it again it would oops
