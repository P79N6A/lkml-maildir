Hm, strange, not for me.. I know that it once worked (with 2.2.10
and one of the ac-patches) but somehow after I installed ac12 it
broke and I am somehow not able to fix it...(even with older kernels/
patches).
Right now I am trying it with 2.2.7 and the knfsd-patches again and I
will see what happens..
Which version of knfsd do you use?
Are any other programs important for this to work?
best,
  Christian
