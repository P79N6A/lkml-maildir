Well, since we only need two in this case, we don't care, but yes, it's 
supposed to be guaranteed by anything that calls itself an x86.
In fact, we _do_ depend on it in a few other sequences. Notably
	sti ; hlt
depends on the fact that an interrupt will always finish _after_ the hlt, 
and we'll never halt before the hlt (and then re-execute the hlt after the 
interrupt), and in
	sti ; iret
where we depend on the fact that we don't get recursive interrupt stacks 
(since we at that point have re-enabled the interrupt that happened).
Of course, if some future x86 decides that the interrupt shadow only
matters for special instructions (ie it's not so much a general interrupt
shadow as a "instruction combination"), I don't think Linux would care. I
really think there are only a very few valid sti-combinations, and I
suspect the above two are pretty much it.
(The other "magic" x86 behaviour is loading into the SS register, which
creates a one-cycle black hole after it. Linux shouldn't care, and in fact
nothing should care about it outside of old 16-bit non-protected-mode
programs, so I think that's another one that could be retired eventually)
