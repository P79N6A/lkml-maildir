I assume you mean uhci-hcd.  usb-uhci is part of Linux 2.4, not 2.6.

You have a USB keyboard, right?  So the ports are always in use -- 
unless you unplug the keyboard.

I don't know what's causing the noise.  Maybe something operating at 
the UHCI controller's 1000-Hz frame rate is coupling to a speaker 
connection.
Anyway it's clearly a hardware problem, even if it is triggered by 
something in software.  About all I can suggest is to surround the 
MacBook with something sound-absorbent.  (Not very helpful, I agree.)
