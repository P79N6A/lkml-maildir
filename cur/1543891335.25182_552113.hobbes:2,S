Subject: [2.6.22-rc3][ACPI?] Resume from s2r doesn't work.

Hi,
resume from suspend to ram doesn't work for my laptop and never
has. So, this is not a regression.
Hibernate (aka suspend to disk) works, however.
When I resume, everything seems to come up (fan becomes busy, disk and
dvd spin up for a short time), but the machine is not responding to
anything - neither keyboard, mouse nor ping from another machine. The
laptop is effectively dead and only a power cycle helps.
I've tried a minimal config and init=/bin/bash as well, but the result
is the same.
When I skip acpi_enter_sleep_state():

 	if ((acpi_gbl_sleep_type_a > ACPI_SLEEP_TYPE_MAX) ||
my laptop suspends and immediately resumes without problems. So it
seems, that the drivers suspend and resume correctly.
Attached is my minimal config, /proc/cpuinfo, lspci -vvv and dmesg
output.  How can I go on from here? Anything I can test, patch or
debug?
Regards, Olaf.
