Because the IDE layer disables the shared IRQ in question for periods of
time of you dont have hdparm -u set, and for some periods of time anyway.
Basically its the IDE code being obnoxious. Fixing the IDE locking would
improve this, but would be a real pain because older IDE controllers you
want to disable_irq and stuff to avoid nasty performance problems.
