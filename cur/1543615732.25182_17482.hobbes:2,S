This might not be immediately relevant but I saw a similar issue with
Radeon DMA engine. What was happenning is that the card has an internal
memory controller which was misconfigured. So it was not "seeing" certain
physical pages. The problem manifested in pages of data filled with 0's.
Also it was often that it worked fine right after boot but became slowly
screwed up as memory was getting more fragmented.
So I think what happens is that your cards idea of pci addressable memory
goes awry with the pages you get from kernel. Try printing out the
addresses and checking whether there is any pattern. Also (probably you
did that already) check linux/Documentation/  for new PCI functions..
