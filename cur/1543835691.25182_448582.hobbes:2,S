There was stuff by Andreas Dilger, to support "online" resizing of
mounted ext2 file systems. I never cared to look for this (does it
support ext3, does it work with current kernels, merge status) since
offline resizing was always sufficient for me.

Well - easy to fix, newfs again with proper inode density (perhaps 1 per
2 kB) and redo the migration. Of course you're free to pay for a new
file system if your fellow admin can't be bothered to remember newfs's
-i option.

No I haven't. As long as they are commercial, it's not likely that I
will.

I think reallocating inodes for UFS and/or ext2/ext3 is possible, even
online, but someone needs to write, debug and field-test the code to do
that - possibly based on Andreas Dilger's earlier ext2 online resizing
work.
