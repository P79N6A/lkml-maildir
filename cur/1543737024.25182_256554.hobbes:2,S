Hi,
Sorry if this is too off topic, but I thought it might be of 
interrest to the people responsible for the FAT code in the kernel and 
possibly others.
The Public Patent Foundation (
http://www.pubpat.org/
) has succeded in 
getting Microsofts patent on FAT ruled invalid. It's not all over yet, but 
it looks good, so it looks like we don't have to fear infringement of this 
patent any longer.
