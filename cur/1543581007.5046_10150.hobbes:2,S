I have Linux running on several older Pentium machines - Pentium -166 MHz 
and Pentium - 120 Mhz.
Under kernel 2.2.13+ these machines report a BogoMips of 66 or 47 
respectively;  suddenly under kernel 2.4.[01] the speed is suddenly 
reported as 332 and 238 respectively.
Has there been a change in the definition of "BogoMips"?
Regards
