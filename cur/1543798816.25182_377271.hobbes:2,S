That is cosimulator code.  It's easy enough to remove.  I'll look into
it.

Really?  I was just going to suggest removing it, but if sticking it in
types.h works for you, then fine.

OK.

Yup.

OK.

For those that are needed, I believe we covered them all.  Some have
suggested removing ioctls.  I'm willing to look into alternatives, but
if you think they're OK, I'd rather leave them.

OK.

OK.

Yup.

I'll look at cleaning them out.  Probably left-overs from some earlier
experiment.

Yea - I'll clean that up.

Don't know - I'll ask around.  We don't support the hardware in 32-bit
anyway, so...

OK.

Tell me about it :-)  Basically, we're doing infiniband in software: no
offload.
