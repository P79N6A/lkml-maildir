They could use

True, but it's all more code and I don't believe that it adds
much value.  It means that people need to run off and find
the documentation, then choose a format.  Which will be different
from other people's chosen formats.  Which will make development
and testing and installation of downstream scripts harder, etc.
You can give people *all* the options at no cost, and without
irritating them, and with less code.  So why make it harder for
everyone by adding this optionality?
