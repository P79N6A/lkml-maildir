  There Mark Smith shows that T/TCP does not (in all error cases)
  act the _same_ as TCP, although that does not necessarily mean
  it would be wrong.
  Reading  W.R.Stevens' book "TCP/IP Illustriated, Volume 3"
  gives a glimpse of how BSD did things in NET/3 code back
  in early 1994-1996, and there I see many odd bits like
  per-host route entires containing support data..
