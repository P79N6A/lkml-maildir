Having seen fragmentation issues build up on (mbox) mail spools over
several years first hand, I can say that mail spools definitely show the
need for a defragmentation tool.  I remember actually doing the "cp -a"
trick just to restore the mail server to decent performance (which
worked amazingly well, for another few months).  (This was before we
switched to hashed directories and a POP3 server which caches mbox
messages offsets/UIDLs/states.)
Being able to defragment online would be very useful.  I've seen some
people talk about this every so often.  How far away is it?
