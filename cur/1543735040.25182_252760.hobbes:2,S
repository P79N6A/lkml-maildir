This stuff does not break name spaces, though.  Not at all.  Root gets
the event and it or some user rescans their mount table.
I can use name spaces with this and they do not break.
You do have an argument with respect to the information leak, but I've
never looked at name spaces as a method of hiding what is mounted.
