"appropriated it", more. Definitely not going to forgive you for deleting 
that comment.

That's the clumsy bit. native_io_delay() used to be an inline outb, now it's 
a switch. Yes, sure, versus an indirect call it's not actually worse, except 
  as an uglification.

This isn't correct. DMI shouldn't override the CONFIG choice or someone with 
matching DMI will have a defective CONFIG option. That's why I put all of it 
inside #ifndef.
