Well, I certainly am not in favor of trying to hack capabilities to work
in a heterogenous environment.  I see no reason why nfs can't be hacked so
that two Linux machines can use capabilities over nfs.  As far as IRIX,
Linux 2.0 nfs servers, ... I just don't see this as an absolute necessity,
especially when it adds what I consider unneeded bloat and complexity to
our implementation.
Of course, at least one gentleman from SGI has been very helpful in this
thread; perhaps IRIX will get patched for this. ;-)

For binaries, hack rdist; for _data_, just use nfs as is w/o caps.
