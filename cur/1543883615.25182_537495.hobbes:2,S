Hi all,
I do not understand it, but setting up some chipset features (tweaks) fail on 
Geode GX1.
In arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cyrix.c function geode_configure() tries to enable 
the "suspend on halt power saving feature". This is the line:
	setCx86(CX86_CCR2, getCx86(CX86_CCR2) | 0x88);
If this register is 0x00 before, it is still 0x00 after this line. If I change 
the line into this:
	ccr2 = getCx86(CX86_CCR2);
	ccr2 |= 0x88;
	setCx86(CX86_CCR2, ccr2);
register ccr2 is 0x88 after the setCx86 call and the power saving feature is 
active (and BTW: the TSC is useless then, because it also stops when the CPU 
runs into a HLT instruction).
setCx86 and getCx86 are macros defined in include/asm-i386/processor.h:
#define getCx86(reg) ({ outb((reg), 0x22); inb(0x23); })
#define setCx86(reg, data) do { \
         outb((reg), 0x22); \
         outb((data), 0x23); \
} while (0)
Maybe the compiler does the wrong thing if someone uses these macros in the 
same instruction?
Regards
Juergen
