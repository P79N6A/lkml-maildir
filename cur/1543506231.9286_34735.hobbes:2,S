Is it possible to mount an ext2 file-system so that only root has
write permission, regardless of individual write permissions on
individual files and directories? If not, how hard would it be to
implement? I have been looking at linux/fs/ext2/acl.c and it looks
like it might already be there, but it isn't apparent as to how to
control the option.
My application is to create a "backup" filesystem using rsync. I want
root to be able to write the files into the filesystem, preserving all
the access modes and ownerships etc. I want individual users to be able
to read back their own files, but not to delete or otherwise modify
them.
Any clues would be appreciated.
