I've made it a personal crusade to eliminate D state.  In addition to all 
the damage done by computer resources being locked up, something about my 
computer ignoring me rankles me on a personal level.
I believe this proposal is about making open() hang, which I think is even 
more painful than having read/write hang.  open() is often designed to 
block much more casually.
