Currently: 2.6.19-git6
2.6.19-git17 still shows some problems, as well:
	ipw3945 driver did not compile (not sure why) - possibly can solve on
my own though.
		(primary laptop is Acer with ipw2200)
	ATI driver did not compile (showstopper)
synaptics driver: - untested in 2.6.19-git17 as ATI driver necessary.
	- still breaks down - over a couple of days - on 2.6.19-git6.  Suspect
timing problem - and also suspect hardware problem.  Breaks down in
about an hour or two if kernel is at 1000Hz timer.
CD recording : recorder no longer detected by "wodim" software set in
2.6.19.   I suspect it's a bug in the software...  but don't know where
to look for changes.   2.6.19-rc5 worked.
hardware: IDE MATSHITADVD-RAM UJ-820S
(2.6.19-git6 also fails with external LiteON USB DVD burner)
SATA: 2.6.19-git6: long delay booting up (up to 30 seconds!!!).  Intel
945G hardware.   These laptops (HP/Compaq nx6310) will not boot with any
kernel below 2.6.19.  They also use Intel 3945 wireless drivers.
(we're shipping this model with linux - and haven't found a comparable
model price and feature-wise that does not use the same chipset)
These also are Pentium M Yonah CPUS - not properly supported by
cpuspeed.   Not sure how much that's affecting things either.
SATA units use a flash hard drive.   This may be a factor as well.
Any help at all in solving these would be appreciated.
Any suggested kernel patchlevels?   Any specific areas to test?
Configuration settings that matter?
for the ATI driver: it's not for distribution but for my primary work
computer - so anything goes.  I just want it to work.
Everything else here however is quite important.
