It works for integers but call do_softirq is more of a problem.  I
could not find an asm constraint that generated correct code in a
single instruction.  The closest I could get was
  __asm__("call *%%eax" : : "a" (do_softirq));
The 'obvious'
  __asm__("call %0" : : "m" (do_softirq));
calls to a location that contains the address of do_softirq, oops.
Any other architectures that call do_softirq inside asm would need
similar hard coding of indirect branches.  It is simpler to export
do_softirq with no version, and have cleaner asm.
