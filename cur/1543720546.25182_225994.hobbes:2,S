Apparently Linux will back all segments by swap space, even if they're 
marked as non-accessable.  Maybe I was told the wrong thing?  Or maybe 
the it's just difficult to create such a segment, as Jukub was saying?
In any case, the solution we have now reserves exactly the amount of 
memory that is needed.  If we were to use a fixed size segment, we would 
be reserving too much memory most of the time, and preventing shared 
libraries being loaded at their prefered addresses.
