You should only `mark arch specific things' when there's a reason --
after all, there are _lots_ of arch-specific definitions in linux, but very
rarely is it important to note that fact; the caller usually doesn't care.
[consider that it might be desirable at some point in the future to have a
arch-independent version of `irq_valid'; the callers shouldn't have to be
changed to accomodate such a change]
In the case of something like `arch_setup_irq', there _is_ a reason:  it's a
small arch-specific `core' for the real generic setup_irq (and one which will
probably be used _only_ by setup_irq).
