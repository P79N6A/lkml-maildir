Yeah; I'm thinking more a staging area where people who use Linux for
desktop work (as I do) can bang on the PM support and other enhancements
they'd be after. Not an end in itself.

Actually, I'm not at all. The slowness in merging suspend2 has so far
been because I've been putting lots of work into trying to get
everything neater and tidier, so I only have myself to blame there :>.
I'm hoping to begin another round of posting patches shortly, hopefully
this time including the substance of the patches.

Yes, I'm aiming for -mm. Stability isn't a problem, and it touches a lot
less of the tree than it used to: the main changes now are refrigerator
improvements and hooks.

Appreciated!
