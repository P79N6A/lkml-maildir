Subject: some bugs with the bridge in  linux2.4.18?

[the problem]: 
in linux2.4.18,when i use brctl to build the bridge,it works. and the hosts can communicate with the host on the other side of the bridge. but when i tried to stop the bridge with cmd "brctl delif bridge eth0",it always hung there. if i plugged off all the cables,the bridge can also be stopped without any problems.
[tested]:
i tracked the program of brctl,and found that the systems stopped at the following code:
	ioctl(br_socket_fd, SIOCDEVPRIVATE, &ifr);
so i guess the problem is in the ioctl in kernel.
i tested both linux2.4.17 and linux2.4.19pre9, none of them has no such problem.
in linux2.4.19pre1,it works well most of the time,but sometimes it fails. when i check the status with "brctl showstp bridge",if one of the interface shows "blocking",then when try to stop the bridge ,the system also hung there.
so i guess one of the patch solved the problem. which one is it? and what is missed in linux2.4.18? i wish i could find out the answer.
(i don't alway come here,so i wish the answser could be CC to me. thanks.)
