Hi,
I have gone through some threads which have mentioned about people 
starting with a project to implement RSA in the kernel. Could someone 
please tell me the state of the project since we are working on an 
application that would need such a patch.
The particular thread i am referring to is 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0406.1/1352.html
If someone is working on it then we would like to contribute
Thanks and Regards,
Bhanu
