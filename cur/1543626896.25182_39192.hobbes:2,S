Good question, I've asked myself that too... Yeah I see some of my ideas
as being nice to have in mainline even without TCQ. The big one being
ata_request_t of course, there are some parts to this:
- Separate scatterlist and dma table out from hwgroup. This is not
  really needed for TCQ, but saves doing a blk_rq_map_sg on a request
  more than once. If future ATA hardware would support more than one
  pending DMA operation per hwgroup, this would be useful even without
  TCQ.
- Use ata_request_t as the main request command. This is where I really
  want to go. I'm not saying that we need a complete IDE mid layer, but
  a private request type is a nice way to unify the passing of a general
  command around. So the taskfile stuff would remain very low level,
  ata_request would add the higher level parts. I could expand lots more
  on this, but I'm quite sure you know where I'm going :-)
Note that the ata_request_t usage is a bit messy in the current patch,
that's merely because I was more focused on getting TCQ stable than
designing this out right now. So I think we should let it mature in the
TCQ patch for just a while before making any final commitments. Agreed?
Of course this will leave me with the pain of merging with your IDE
stuff every time a new -pre comes out (updating this patch from
2.5.1-pre where I last used it was _not_ funny! :-), but I can handle
that.
In addition, there are small buglet fixes in the patch that should go to
general. I will extract these, I already send you one of these earlier
today.
BTW, I just found an SMP race in the current patch. I'll send out a new
version later, for now it's here:
