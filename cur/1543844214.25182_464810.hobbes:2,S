That's true, and that's one reason why I've advocated the solution
implemented by Rohit's patches, that is: just throw in the towel and
be happy to count just pages.
Look at the beancounter stuff, and it has hooks (in the form of gfp
flags) throughput the tree, and they still manage to miss accounting
user exploitable memory overallocation from some callers. Maintaining
that will be much more difficult and error prone.
