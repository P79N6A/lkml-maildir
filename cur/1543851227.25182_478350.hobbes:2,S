IMHO, from a theoretical point-of-view, I prefer the way it is: 
the driver will upload any firmware you tell it to upload. 
Since writing the driver, some consensus has been reached on how
this is done. This, for example, doesn't involve the misc device
that I use.

I see two different processors, there are three.

From a legal point of view, that is undesirable: You'd be linking
the propritary firmware with the kernel, which disallows distribution
of the resulting kernel or module binary.
