I think people care. Andre said he was working on a fix for the Seagate
drives some time back. It does seem that all BIOSs leave SATA drives in
PIO mode. That may be a bios bug really rather than a linux bug. But if
you put the hdparm somewhere early in boot you should be ok, as a
temporary workaround.
