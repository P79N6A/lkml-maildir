From a page cache standpoint softirq's are 100% equivalent to hardware
irq's, so that doesn't much help here.

Being in the page cache can be ok. What is _not_ ok is if this function
can ever be the last user to release such a page (ie the original page
count of the page had better be held on by something else - which usually
is the page-cacheness itself, since shrinking the page cache will only
happen for pages that are unused).
