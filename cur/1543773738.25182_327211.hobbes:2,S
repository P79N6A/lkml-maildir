Well, I though this wouldn't break anything since HW_INT_ENABLE is not
set there is 2.6.12. Is this a new feature ?
How is this supposed to work ? Does HW_INT_ENABLE in this outw require
some other parts of the git-alsa.patch ?

No, same error.
Your second patch gives same error too, but it also made my beeper
generate a very sharp sound during the whole boot.
Actually, I can't test after boot since -mm1 crashes a little bit
later on my laptop. That's why I didn't notice any eventual h/w
volume control breakage with my patch :)
If necessary, I can try with git-alsa.patch applied on top of 2.6.12.
