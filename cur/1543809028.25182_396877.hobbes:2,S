Unfortunately.  Finding OXFW911-based ones for about the same price is still
not hard...

That's going to cause fun problems on reboot if it actually has write-behind
cache...

Pardon?  If it's type 14, we won't issue MODE SENSE for page 8 and will
go for page 6 instead...

sd_mod issues MODE SENSE from sd_read_cache_size() and does that twice -
once for minimal length to get the length device wants to give and then
for actual length.

Maybe, maybe not.  Note that e.g. aforementioned INQUIRY bug in pl3507 is
triggered by dmraid, which works via SG_IO, just as scsiinfo.  And unlike
scsiinfo it's run from /etc/rc.sysinit on current FC4...
