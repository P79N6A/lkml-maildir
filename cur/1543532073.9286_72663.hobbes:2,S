There are two issues here:
(i) Solaris, BSD, Unixware partitions (slices) were numbered in between
the DOS partitions. This caused shifts in naming when booting a kernel
with or without e.g. Unixware support.
In Linux 2.3.40 this was changed in such a way that (in case of a
DOS-type partition table) first the four primary partitions get
a number, next the logical partitions, and afterwards possible
Solaris, BSD, Unixware sub-partitions.
This makes the numbering a bit more stable.
[It also means that people using Solaris, BSD, or Unixware will see
a shift in numbering when upgrading to a post-2.3.40 kernel. Beware!]
(ii) Since things are numbered sequentially, when you add or remove
anything, all following partitions get a new number. That is unavoidable.
(However, it may be possible to mount by volume label and avoid
unpleasant effects.)

I conjecture that you did not have any device nodes /dev/hda16 etc.
Use mknod to create them.

Probably the disk was mounted read-only, so /etc/mtab did not reflect
the current situation. Maybe /proc/mounts would have told you.

In reality names are not used anywhere, a block device is specified by
a pair (major,minor). For stuff living on hda, major equals 3 and minor
takes values between 0 and 63, where 0 is the whole disk, and the rest
are partitions or slices or whatever you prefer to call them.
This numbering scheme does not really allow for a hierarchical structure
since 6 bits is not enough.
