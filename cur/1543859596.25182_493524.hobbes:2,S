The low byte of eip should be 5f and it changed to 60, so that's
probably not it.  And the oops report is consistent with that being
the instruction that was really executed, so it's not the kernel
misreporting the address after it happened.
You weren't trying kprobes or something, were you? Have you ever
had another unexplained oops with this machine?
