could you try the attached patch - does it trigger the DMA timeouts
again? There were 3 changes to the IOAPIC code that could have affected
your dma-timeout problem, this patch reverts all of them.
Mark's suggestion sounds quite plausible too - but the question is, your
timeout problems went away previously by tweaking io_apic.c, so it would
be nice to see that they are still gone even with the old 'broken'
io_apic.c logic. (none of the io_apic.c changes fixes any particular
bug, they are only latency optimizations, so i'd be surprised if they
really impacted your timeout problems.)
if the DMA timeouts are still gone even with this patch applied then i
think it's safe to conclude that Mark's explanation is the correct one,
and that it was starvation of the SCHED_OTHER IDE irq-thread that caused
the timeouts: it _really_ was a timeout. (a workaround would be to make
the timeout longer)
