That's fine, I do not want to use the kobject refcount for modules.
modules have "special" refcount issues that you've already solved.  I
don't want to go down that rathole :)

Um, I don't understand.  There is no "struct module *owner in struct
kobject.  There is one in struct attribute, but I don't set it, so it
doesn't matter for this usage.

read/write of what?  The attribute?  Sure, why not set the module
attribute sysfs file to the module that way the reference count will be
incremented if the sysfs file is opened.
I'm not trying to touch the module reference count logic here, besides
adding the kobject reference count to the internal module count logic.
I think I got it all correct and it worked for me :)
But in looking at your patch, I don't see why you want to separate the
module from the kobject?  What benefit does it have?
Hey, you're the maintainer, it's your call :)

Yes, I was going to add it, this patch was more of a "test" to see how
receptive you were to it.
If you want, I can add the options and other info based off of this
patch.
