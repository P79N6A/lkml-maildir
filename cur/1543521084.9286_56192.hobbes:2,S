Assuming it can be recompiled.  Not all programs are available in
source.  Source gets lost (there was a big market for object to
Cobol 'disassemblers' recently).  Vendors go away.  Vendors charge
large amounts of money for upgrades.  Upgrades don't run on older
operating systems.  Newer operating systems don't run on older
hardware.
