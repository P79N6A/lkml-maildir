Oops!
The error exits are not right in foo_init (need to release anything
succesfully created, if later operations fail). Probably need to make
the current foo_exit into foo_cleanup and call it in real foo_exit and
in any errors at foo_init.
But, again thanks for the help. I consider the "case closed" now.
