3-order is 32k actually.

e1000 is trying to allocate 32k, not 16 for jumbo frames.

Correct, except that it wants 32k.
e1000 logic is following:
align frame size to power-of-two, then skb_alloc adds a little
(sizeof(struct skb_shared_info)) at the end, and this ends up 
in 32k request just for 9k jumbo frame.
And it wants it in atomic context.
