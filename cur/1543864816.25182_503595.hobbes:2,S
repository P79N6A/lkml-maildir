Firstly, it think it should be mentioned that Thomas' queue already does 
this, in clocksource-remove-the-update-callback.patch (hence he should 
have been Cc:-ed). Your queue 'drops' Thomas' patch then redoes it here 
without mentioning that this is another version of what is in Thomas's 
queue. So we get this situation:
   clocksource-remove-the-update-callback.patch
   drop-clocksource-remove-the-update-callback.patch
   clocksource_remove_update_callback.patch
that all flip-flops the same thing.
Secondly, your patch seems to do other changes as well:

this adds a new event to a place that didnt have it before. (If this is 
fixing up an initialization artifact then that needs a comment at 
least.)
plus:

is not mentioned in the changelog. It's also needlessly global. 
Furthermore, it seems to be a rather unclean method of passing 
information from clocksource_callback() into change_clocksource():

that's quite bad: you lost an information passing facility by going to a 
notifier, and you try to work it around via a global atomic variable. 
Which also looks quite racy as well.
The clean solution is i think what Thomas did: he calls straight into 
clocksource_change_rating(). And look at Thomas' patch:
 3 files changed, 17 insertions(+), 37 deletions(-)
versus yours:
 5 files changed, 45 insertions(+), 42 deletions(-)
Thomas' looks definitely simpler to me.
