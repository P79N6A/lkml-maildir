Right, dma_addr_t values are all the driver sees in the current scheme.

Agreed, the issue is how to do this without requiring an
interrupt+callback sequence for each transaction or requiring the
client to carry per transaction unmap-data.  For example NET_DMA never
sees a dma_addr_t and assumes that all it needs to care about is the
last transaction in a sequence.  Since it is alive for the duration of
a transaction, we could put unmap data in dma_async_tx_descriptor
along with an unmap function pointer since dma_unmap* routines have an
equal number of parameters.  But I just got through making this
structure smaller so maybe there is a better way.
