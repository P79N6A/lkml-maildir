think CONFIG_PREEMPT.  In either case a spinlock becomes
lock_irq_disable in the !SMP, !PREEMPT case but it documents the
intention a whole lot better.
Also you're locking only in a single plpace which is a ***BIG*** warning
sign.  At least look at the other users of the data structure, it's
extremly likely they'll need locking aswell.
