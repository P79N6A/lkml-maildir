You cannot have it both ways.  Either the kernel needs testers, or it is
"stable".  See how these are opposites?
We don't _need_ people to test stable kernels, because they're stable. 
(OK, we'll pick up on a few things, but we'd pick up on them if people were
testing tip-of-tree, as well).
The 2.6.x.y thing is a service to people who want 2.6.x with kinks ironed
out.  It's not particularly interesting or useful from a development POV,
apart from its potential to attract a few people who are presently stuck on
2.4 or 2.6.crufty.

It won't help that at all.  None of these proposals will increase testing
of tip-of-tree.  In fact the 2.6.x proposal may decrease that level of
that testing, although probably not much.
There is no complete answer to all of this, because there are competing
needs.  It's a question of balance.
