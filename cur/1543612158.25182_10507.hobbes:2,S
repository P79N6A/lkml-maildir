I have a few processes that were started in a smb mount directory. Due
to server reboot the connection broke. The processes are now in an
uninterruptable state, waiting for IO, so, they cannot be killed nor the
smbfs unmounted.
Obviously, the only thing I can do is to reboot my computer. 
Any suggestions?
