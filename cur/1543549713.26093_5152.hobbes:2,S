Unless Im missing something here think about this case
2 active processes, no swap
#1					#2
kmalloc 32K				kmalloc 16K
OK					OK
kmalloc 16K				kmalloc 32K
block					block
so GFP_KERNEL has to be able to fail - it can wait for I/O in some cases with
care, but when we have no pages left something has to give
