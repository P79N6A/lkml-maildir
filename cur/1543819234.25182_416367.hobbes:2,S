An implemenation similar to one you are mentioning was already proposed
sometime back.

The design was also meant to not restrict/limit per-cpu memory being
allocated from modules.  Maybe it was too early then, and maybe now is the 
right time, going by the interest in this thread :).  IMHO, a new solution
should fix both static and dynamic per-cpu allocators, 
- Avoid possibility of false sharing for dynamically allocated per-CPU data
(with current alloc percpu) 
- work early enough -- if alloc_percpu can work early enough, (we can use
that for counters like slab cachep stats which is currently racy; using 
atomic_t for them would be bad for performance)
An extra dereference in Steven's original proposal is bad, (I had done some
measurements earlier).  My implementation had one less reference compared to
static per-cpu allocators, but the performance of both were the same as
the __per_cpu_offset table is always cache hot.

Yep, we waste a few tlb entries then, which is a bit of concern, but then we
might be able to use hugetlbs for blocks of per-cpu data and minimize the 
impact.
