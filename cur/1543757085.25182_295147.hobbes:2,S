I really don't have an objection to that for the case of the shared
libraries in, for example, /lib and /usr/lib.  I just worry about making
sure that all of the libraries have so been marked.  I can do this
in a much simpler way by just adding a list of "do not migrate stuff"
to the migration library rather than requiring Steve Longerbeam's
API.

So the default would be that if the file is not mapped as "not-migratable",
then the file would be migratable, is that the idea?

Making memory migration a subset of page migration is not a general
solution.  It only works for programs that are using memory policy
to control placement.   As I've tried to point out multiple times
before, most programs that I am aware of use placement based on
first-touch.  When we migrate such programs, we have to respect
the placement decisions that the program has implicitly made in
this way.
Requiring memory migration to be a subset of the NUMA API is a
non-starter for this reason.   We have to follow the approach
of doing the correct migration, followed by fixing up the NUMA
policy to match the new reality.  (Perhaps we can do this as
part of memory migration.)
Until ALL programs use the NUMA mempolicy for placement
decisions, we cannot support page migration under the NUMA
API.
I don't understand why this is not clear to you.  Are you
assuming that you can manufacture a NUMA API for the new
location of the job that correctly represents the placement
information and toplogy of the job on the old set of nodes?
