the "nx" shows that if you configure your kernel correctly (enable PAE)
that you indeed have a non-executable capability, which will apply to
the stack (and afaik the heap too)

it's debatable what the file means; the maps file shows software
permissions currently not hardware enforced permissions. The "problem"
is that if you show software permissions... it's harder to see the
kernels view (vma's etc). I don't think there's a perfect answer.
It gets even more complex if you have something like execshield in use;
where the stack and heap are non-executable, unless you get a "higher"
executable mapping. In that case, the appearance of such a higher
mapping would change the visual mapping of other mappings. Outright
confusing as well :)

your cpu has this bit, you just didn't turn it on ;(

enable
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
and you're all set.
