At one point you said you'd like to work with us, and earlier in the
threads you stated that porting suspend2 to userland should be easy.
[I do not think that putting suspend2 into git is useful thing to
do. Of course, it is your option; but it seems to me that people
likely to use suspend2 are not the kind of people that use git.]
It would be very helpful if you could install uswsusp, then try to
make suspend2 run in userland on top of uswsusp interface. Not
everything will be possible that way, but it most of features should
be doable that way. I'd hate to code yet another splashscreen code,
for example...
