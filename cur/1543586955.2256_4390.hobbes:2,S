i'm still having loopback problems with linux 2.4.3, even though they
were supposed to be fixed. it doesn't deadlock my maching right away
anymore, but instead causes a kernel panic after 4-6 uses of the loop
device.
the message i get is: "Kernel panic: Invalid blocksize passed to
set_blocksize"
100% reproducable. has anyone else seen this?
i did compile with gcc 2.92.3, and i have hedrick's ide patches
applied.
anyone else see this?
p.s. please cc: me in any replies, i'm not on the list.
