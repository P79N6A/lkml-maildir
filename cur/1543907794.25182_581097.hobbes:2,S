Yes. I'd give a lot to know what went wrong when I tried that in April.
It'd have saved me many hours of work if I had discovered this workaround
before.

I think a lot would be gained if disable_IO_APIC() would just mask the IRQs
(like the function in my patch does), and perhaps fix the dest ID, instead of
totally clearing the registers.
Moreover, it'd be reasonable to separate out the code that restores virtual
wire mode from disable_IO_APIC().

Even if my patch in the form in which I submitted it is unusable,
I think the basic idea that IRQs should be masked bottom-up
(IO-APIC first, then local APIC, then CPU) is correct.
Or is there any specific reason why the current code does it vice-versa?
