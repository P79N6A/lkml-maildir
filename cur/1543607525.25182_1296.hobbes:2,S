Maciej and I discussed all this a while back, and I had a patch
which did exactly that that Richard suggested, plus:
 as far as I can tell, it conforms to any existing mmap(2) documentation;
 is more effective than current implementation, as I call the second
 find_vma() only after VM wraparound, which is extremely rare;
 keeps osf /sbin/loader happy, so no need for alpha-specific routine.
Patch appended, comments?
Ivan.
P.S. Just noticed missing closing brace in the patch from my previous post...
     Sorry.
