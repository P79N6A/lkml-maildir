Instead of adding your PnP BIOS to the black list, I may know a way to 
support it completely even though it is broken.
To prove this idea could you please do the following:
1.) apply patch 1 (attached below) to a clean kernel (2.5.45).  Compile the 
kernel with PnP BIOS support and list the last few messages that start with 
"pnp!!!:" before it panics.  You probably will want to have kernel debugging
off so it doesn't scroll the messages off the screen.
2.) Apply patch 2 (attached below) to a clean kernel (2.5.45).  Compile the 
kernel with PnP BIOS support.  It should start up completely without a panic.  
This is not a complete fix however.  Anyway attach a copy of the output from 
dmesg.
If my theory is correct I will have a fix out soon.
thanks,
Adam
