Thanks for the tips, Jakob.
I *will* be exporting via NFS, so this is definetly good to know. I've
been looking at using jfs and reiser as well, but some preliminary
benchmarks suggested that xfs was the best performer for the kind of
workload that I'm anticipating. I guess xfs is out of the question now,
as I definetly don't want to deal with weird interactions like that.
Can anyone speak on the stability of (reiser|jfs|other) with nfs? My
biggest requirements are online resizing and stability (ext3 online
resize is still beta IIRC, but I wouldn't be opposed to using it if
someone could tell me otherwise); speed would be nice, but I'm willing
to sacrifice speed for the sake of reliability.
I'm personally using lvm + reiser + nfs without consequence on my
fileserver at home, but it's not seeing nearly the loads that this box
is going to see.
Thanks again,
