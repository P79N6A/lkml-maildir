There's obviously a misunderstanding here. What I do is:
SUSPEND all but swap device and parents
WRITE LRU pages
SUSPEND swap device and parents (+sysdev)
Snapshot
RESUME swap device and parents (+sysdev)
WRITE snapshot
SUSPEND swap device and parents
POWERDOWN everything
I thought I wrote - perhaps I'm wrong here - that I understand that your
new work in this area might make this unnecessary. I really only want to
do it this way because I don't know what other drivers might be doing
while we're writing the LRU pages. I'm not worried about them touching
LRU. What I am worried about is them allocating memory and starving
suspend so that we get hangs due to being oom. If they're suspended, we
have more certainty as to how memory is being used. I don't remember
what prompted me to do this in the first place, but I'm pretty sure it
would have been a real observed issue.
Regards,
Nigel
