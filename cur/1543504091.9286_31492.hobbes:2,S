That depends on what the resolution is referring to: the clock or the
timer. The timer has a resolution of 1/HZ seconds, which is currently on
an Intel based Linux kernel 10 msecs. However the resolution of the clock
itself is much better. The current clock resolution is in microseconds,
but is probably better. Ask the current Linux clock guru.
So what you get is the worst case resolution.
