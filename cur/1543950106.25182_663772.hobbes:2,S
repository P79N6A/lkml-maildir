Yes please do these transformations only for code that you can compile.
One easy way to do that is to do an allyesconfig build once and save the log (or 
fetch 
http://halobates.de/allyes/i386-2.6.24-rc6-git12
 and 
http://halobates.de/allyes/x86_64-2.6.24-rc6-git12
 as an older example) 
and always check if the file you're changing is compiled in the log.
Then after changing do at least a make allyesconfig ; make path/to/file.o
