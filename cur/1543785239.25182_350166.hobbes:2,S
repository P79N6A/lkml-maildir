IEEE 1394 power management (i.e. management of bus power consumption or 
of other nodes' internal power states) is not related to ACPI suspend/ 
resume of the local controller AFAICS.
According to your log, the cause is to be looked for in ohci1394's 
purely hardware related parts or perhaps even outside of the ieee1394 
subsystem.
