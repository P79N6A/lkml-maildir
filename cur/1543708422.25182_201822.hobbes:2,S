Two things:
- I've looked harder, and I still don't see some pre-exiting get pt_regs
  off the stack func / macro.  But it would probably be generally useful
  since it _looks_ like there's few places it could be used.  Or maybe I
  misread something and just missed it (not being an i386 person, it's
  possible :))
- The current plan for KGDB stuffs is to punt on the thread stuffs for
  now anyhow, so we can look at this again later.
