Nothing fishy, nothing at all... It's as simple as
driver/block/scsi_ioctl.c doesn't accepts requestes larger than 64KB,
while readcd asks for 256KB.

sg_io returns EINVAL (line 163), but driver/block/ioctl.c transforms it
to ENOTTY (see last 8 lines).

SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE is actually TCGETS, originates in stdio and is not
relevant.

It's not a bug, but implementation deficiency. Cheers. A.
