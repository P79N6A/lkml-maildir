void submit_bh(int rw, struct buffer_head * bh)
{
~        int count = bh->b_size >> 9;
~        if (!test_bit(BH_Lock, &bh->b_state))
~                BUG();
Does anyone know what that BUG(); is testing? We're seeing it and want
to track down what we're doing that is causing it.
It's at line 1289 of drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c
Thanks!
