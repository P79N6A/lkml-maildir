Ehh, I ran into this a while ago.  When you compile raid as modules it
doesn't use the raid superblocks for anything except for verification.  I
took a quick glance at the source and the auto-detect code is ifdefed out if
you compiled as a module.
Ever since I have had raid compiled into my kernels.
