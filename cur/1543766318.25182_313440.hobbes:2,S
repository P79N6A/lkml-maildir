kprobes would require an exception for each patchpoint because
it uses an trap instruction. 
Probably a bit too costly for commonly used functions. Especially
on a P4 exceptions are quite costly. 
But you could add lightweight kprobes that just use jmp 
for it in the kprobes  framework, that might be useful for other stuff too
