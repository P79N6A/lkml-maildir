Subject: [patch 2.6.14-rc2 0/5] swiotlb maintenance and x86_64 dma_sync_single_range_for_{cpu,device}
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/26/231

Conduct some maintenance of the swiotlb code:
	-- Move the code from arch/ia64/lib to drivers/pci
	-- Cleanup some cruft (code duplication)
	-- Add support for syncing sub-ranges of mappings
	-- Add support for syncing DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL mappings
	-- Comment fixup & change record
Also, tack-on an x86_64 implementation of dma_sync_single_range_for_cpu
and dma_sync_single_range_for _device.  This makes use of the new
swiotlb sync sub-range support.
In this round, the new location for swiotlb is driver/pci/swiotlb.c.
This is the result of discussions on lkml pointing-out that swiotlb is
closely related to PCI.
