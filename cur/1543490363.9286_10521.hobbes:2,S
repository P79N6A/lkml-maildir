Thanks for clearing up my confusion. Now I understand what the
original code does.
What I tried to implement was two-way elevator seeking (SCAN). In my
tiny benchmark that let many threads write on random files, SCAN
showed a throughput improvement of anywhere between 0 to 20%. But I
also noticed benefits in the original algorithm (it's fairer), so I
don't know if my change makes sense.
