I don't understand, why you think cwq cannot be NULL here.

BTW, isn't needs_a_good_name needles after this and after del_timer positive?

If this runs while a work function is fired in run_workqueue,
it sets _PENDING bit, but if the work skips rearming, we have probably
endless loop, again.

It's very interesting proposal, but also hard to analyse - the locks
are taken and given away, and there is hard to forsee, when and where
the loop regains the lock again. It is something alike to the current
way, with some added measures: you try to shoot a work on the run,
while queued or timer_pending, plus the _PENDING flag set, so it seems,
there is some risk of longer than planed looping.
I have to look at this more, at home and, if something new, I'll write
tomorrow. So, the good news, is you should have enough sleep this time!
Cheers,
Jarek P.
