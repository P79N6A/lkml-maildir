Actually, you're quite correct about the first instance - 'mask' may
be generated from 1 << 32 - 1, which is definitely reachable, and gcc
will warn about.  There's also another bug - an out by one on whether
to use the second word to construct the value.
However, the other 5 warnings are due to (corrected version):
	if (16 + 0 > 32)
		__res |= resp[__off-1] << (32 - 0);
Obviously, this code is not reachable since the if condition is false.
Therefore, gcc's whinging about the shift being >= 32 is wrong.
That said, the fix doesn't change gcc's code generation, so I think I'll
apply the changes.  Thanks.
