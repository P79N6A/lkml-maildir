What the fuck is your problem?  I was merely wondering how to use
path_init/path_walk.  I had to go to the newbie irc channel and they were
much politer and must more helpful.  None of this fucking attitude of "why
do you want to do that that is evil never do that".  Obviously i have a
reason to do it and I don't need you lecturing me.

Well I lack the knowledge to do that.  Can you be a bit more specific as
to code examples or whatnot?  Just being vague and saying "you don't need
to do that" is bad.
Anyway I am doing it from module_init() in a module I am writing, so the
current thread context is pretty much a good one.
