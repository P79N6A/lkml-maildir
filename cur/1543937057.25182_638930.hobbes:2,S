One vaguely related question:  Is there presently any way to adjust  
the per-user max-key-data limit? I've been tinkering with using the  
new-ish MIT kerberos "KEYRING:" credentials-cache code to hold keys  
for persistent daemons.  Unfortunately "root" keeps hitting the limit  
even with only about 16 keys allocated across a few sessions.  After  
perusing the docs I can't find any documentation on adjusting the  
limits.
I'd really like some way to specifically allow root to allocate up to  
several megs worth of non-swappable key data, although I suppose just  
increasing the global limit slightly wouldn't be bad either.  If such  
functionality already exists then I'd appreciate a pointer to it (and  
possibly respond in kind with documentation patches).
Cheers,
