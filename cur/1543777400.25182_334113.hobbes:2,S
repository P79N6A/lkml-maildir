I disagree.
There should be an _absolute_ interface, and a driver that wants that 
should just have calculated when in time the timeout finishes - and then 
keep on using the absolute value.
Btw, this is exactly why the jiffy-based thing is _good_. The kernel 
timers _are_ absolute, and you make them relative by adding "jiffies".
The fact is, the current timers are better than people give them credit 
for, and converting them away from a jiffies-based interface (to a 
usleep-like one) is STUPID.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with "jiffies", and anybody who thinks 
that
	msleep(20);
is fundamentally better than
	timeout = jiffies + HZ/50;
just doesn't realize that the latter is a bit more complicated exactly 
because the latter is a hell of a lot more POWERFUL. Trying to get rid of 
jiffies for some religious reason is _stupid_.
I have to say, this whole thread has been pretty damn worthless in general 
in my not-so-humble opinion.
