:), although i prefer previous one, what about something like following?
With 3f1b0e1f287547903f11fa1e6de7d2765597766e Linus's current git tree starts 
to ignore any *.rej files (for example "git status" cannot show what are 
they) but if there are some *.rej files exists, for whatever reason, that 
means some unresolved merge conflicts occured for that code tree and this 
tree is no longer trusted so better not to ignore this.
