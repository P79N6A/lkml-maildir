This appears to have fixed the problem!  I made the
change to the kernel on the broken MB and the link
stayed up.  So I went ahead and made the change to the
kernel on the working one too.   Right now I'm using
netcat to saturate the link and make sure it stays up.
 So far it's looking good, if I have any problems I'll
let you know.
Thanks,
Kevin
