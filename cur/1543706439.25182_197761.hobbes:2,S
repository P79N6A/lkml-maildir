Subject: BUG: Why does ramfs always get built?

ramfs cannot be removed from the kernel
Description:
Now, I wonder if there's any reason why the Simple RAM-based file
system, which is "more of an programming example than a usable file
system" (according to Configure.help), needs to be present in the
kernel.
Keywords: ramfs build Config.in
Kernel version:
Linux version 2.4.24 (root@metuzalem) (gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)) #7 Ne úno 8 05:57:36 CET 2004
OK, it's line 55 of fs/Config.in, which reads:
define_bool CONFIG_RAMFS y
I think, it should read:
tristate 'Simple RAM-based file system support' CONFIG_RAMFS
but maybe this is a known issue and the ramfs is needed for something
I can't figure out (I recompiled my kernel without ramfs and it works
fine, so there is at least one configuration which does _NOT_ require
it and it should then definitely be optional anyway).
I know the piece of code is really small, but I don't want it
there.  Just because I don't need it and any unnecessary code is
inherently dangerous, as any code is a potential security hole.
For convenience sake, I've included a patch.
