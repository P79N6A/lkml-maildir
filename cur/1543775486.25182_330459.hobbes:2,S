FUSE is a generic FS API which is _very_ easy to write an FS for
(learning curve is about 10-15 minutes starting after you have unpacked
the fuse source code, at least it took me that long to start writing an
FS based on the example one provided).  NFS is not anything like that.
Also can the NFS approach provide me with different content depending on
the uid of the accessing process?  With FUSE that is easy as pie.  Even
easier than that actually...
Best regards,
