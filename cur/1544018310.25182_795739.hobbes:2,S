We actually used to do that: we excluded all tasks that did not share the 
same cpuset in select_bad_process().  That exclusion was reimplemented as 
a preference in badness() since, again, it is quite possible that a large 
memory-hogging task without a sufficient oom_adj score, as you mentioned, 
has allocated memory on the cpuset's nodes before being moved to a 
different cpuset or changing its set of allowable nodes.
I think you would find the per-cgroup oom notifier patch[*] of interest.  
It seems to have been dropped after some discussion on improvements, but 
allows you to defer all of these decisions to userspace.  Would something 
like that fix your problem?
