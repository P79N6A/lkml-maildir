You Rule!
The tweak to page-cluster is basically magic for this test.
With page-cluster=4, the mp3blaster sputtered like 2.4.13pre2aa1.
Better, but not beautiful.
Real beauty happens with page-cluster=2.  There is virtually no sputter.  
And the wall clock time is a little better than 2.4.13pre2aa1!
I don't know what page-cluster size is best for everything, but 
2.4.12aa1 (which was very good IMHO), sputtered about 10 seconds per 
iteration, and each iteration took 64 seconds.
2.4.13pre3aa1 with no sputters:  48 seconds.
Amazing!
Also, interactive "feel" is much better too.  This test would
really brutalize keyboard response.  With 2.4.13-pre3aa1 and 
page-cluster=2, the box is still usable.  (for more than listening
to mp3's  :))
