I was using dbench  with three threads.  In retrospect, I am pretty sure 
my 2GB of ram was creating that performance.  Though, the poor 
performance when run on the raid0 device still stands.
This performance hit doesn't exist when using hdparm to test the 
bandwidth of the devices
/dev/sdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  166 MB in  3.01 seconds =  55.19 MB/sec
psuedomode:/mnt# hdparm -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  126 MB in  3.02 seconds =  41.72 MB/sec
psuedomode:/mnt# hdparm -t /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  338 MB in  3.02 seconds = 112.07 MB/sec
sda is pata libata
sdc is sata libata
md0 is two identical sata libata devices (sdc and sdd) in RAID0
So apparently, this may be filesystem related, as it pertains to being 
in a raid setup (since the filesystems are all the same otherwise except 
size).
