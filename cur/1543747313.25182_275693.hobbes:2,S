show_trace() has made a fool of me and I started to ask silly questions :)

Ok, i'm tested 2.4.25 - same result. But this is complete userland problem.
There two problem:
First - show_trace() give incorrect traces. it strat unwind stack from
address in `tsk->thread.esp', but it should use address saved in `regs->ebp'
- this make more accuracy stack trace.
Second - strange libpthreads problem. 
libpthreads always install own sa_restorer helper, and when first signal
arrived - call signal handler and if (when process in signal handler)
arrived new signal - lipthreads start play with rt_sigprocmask() and
rt_sigsuspend() syscalls inside own sa_restorer helper. 
woops - infinity loop inside libpthreads.
