Not per-inode? dentries are a bitmore memory-constrained than inodes, and 
we only need this for filesystems that want to support it, so we wouldn't 
need to put this information in each dentry.
Since the vfsmounts have back-pointers to the dentry they are mounted on,
you can still do a "per-dentry" traversal, by just doign the inode list
and checking the dentry pointer. No?
Alternatively, we could just put the list on an external hash-chain 
entirely, and hash off the dentry. It depends on how often we end up 
needing it.
Or we could just put it in the dentry itself. I'd hate to make it any 
bigger than it already is, but maybe it doesn't matter that much.

Ok, I'll admit that I don't know how to handle namespaces. These things 
should just go into a global namespace, and I was kind of assuming it 
would happen automatically in "lookup_mnt()" or something like that. A 
special case in lookup_mnt which says something like "if you didn't find a 
vfsmount, we create a new one for you".
It should be reasonably easy to create new ones on-the-fly, since we'd
have all the information (the parent vfsmount comes stated, and the
vfsmount we create would point to the same things that the "base" one
would).

Don't allow umount. It's not something the user can unmount - the mount is 
"implied" in the file.

Ahh. Umm.. Yes. I think this might be the real problem. Unless I seriously 
clossed something over when I blathered about the "create the vfsmount on 
the fly" thing above ;)

Why not? When doing the ->lookup() operation, the filesystem would create
the vfsmount and bind it to the current vfsmount. That guarantees that it
has a vfsmount, and will mean that it will show up positive with the
"d_mountpoint()" query, which in turn will cause us to do the
"lookup_mnt()".
Which in turn will create the other vfsmounts as needed, if you have 
multiple namespaces.
So I _think_ creation is easy. Getting rid of the dang things migth be 
harder.

Why not just let the existing .lookup method initialize the mount-point 
thing? After that, it's all in the VFS layer (I'd hate to have filesystems 
mess around with vfsmounts - they'll just get it wrong).

I don't think you can get partial sharing on one of these puppies. You'd 
always have one vfsmount per namespace (well, lazily created, so maybe in 
practice you'd see a lot fewer).

Allow file-on-file mounts - it will just totally hide the thing (in that
namespace, at least). But don't allow the dir-on-file thing (that we
already don't allow).

I don't think you'll have any special cases. Same d_mountpount(), same 
lookup_mnt().

You couldn't get at the attributes that way anyway, so I think the point 
is moot. The "real" directory always takes over.
Crazy people could try to just use the regular "xattrs" interfaces if they 
really want attributes on directories. You wouldn't ever be able to use 
the "easy" one.

Don't go there. See above. Directories would be just plain directories, 
you could never see their metadata. Same goes for at least symlinks, and 
possibly other filetypes too (ie at least initially, a block or character 
special device will just take over the whole "file_operations", which 
includes "readdir", so it's actually hard to have the filesystem do 
anything about those).
