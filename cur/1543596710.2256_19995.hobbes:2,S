I doubt it.  insmod relocates the code and data sections, discards
sections, inserts a struct module, hooks the module into the existing
change and generally mangles the object before it can be used by the
kernel.  Any change to a page prevents it being mapped against cramfs.
If you had a complete page that was identical before and after insmod
had done its work I would be astonished.
