I like CONFIG_PROC_CONFIG a lot, but I'm opposed to this particular
implementation of it.
It discards semantic information from the .config file, and once that
information is lost, it can't be regenerated.
I want /proc/config.gz to contain a *lossless* copy of the .config file.
That makes it the most reliable and useful.  And I prefer that it come
in a standard format (straight gzip compression, no s/CONFIG_// games),
so that people can access it any way they want without needing to run
it through yet another custom text mangler.
I am building a configuration system with well-defined semantics,
a written manual for Config Language, a real parser with static error
checking, and so on.  That's my vision.  I don't want to see a system
that works fine if you use it the way the author says, has its own
capricious format, and loses some of your configuration information if
you do something a bit different.  If I wanted that kind of configuration
system, I'd boot up something with a four-colored flag.
