but before CONFIG_SPARSEIRQ feature age, for_each_irq_desc() guaranteed
to return !NULL value.
recently CONFIG_SPARSEIRQ break this assumption. I hope to restore it.
In addition, if we make both for_each_irq_desc() and for_each_irq_desc().
for_each_irq_desc() become unused macro.
from cleanup view, unused function/macro is not preferred.
