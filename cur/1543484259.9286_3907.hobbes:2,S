I have been tracking the i386 kernel-to-userland binary API since June
1994.  During that time, it has grown a lot bigger, but I have seen few
changes to existing interfaces, and almost no gratuitious changes.
Unfortunately 'few' may turn out to be 'more than MIT can tolerate'.
Education would help a lot here.  I think the Documentation/ directory
needs an entire subdirectory devoted to kernel coding guidelines,
from obvious things like "don't use float" to more subtle things
like "you may never change a structure which is used in any ioctl
call; you may only add new calls with new structures".
