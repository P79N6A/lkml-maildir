Good. I think the patch is to be applied to all mainstream kernels.
The only obstacle is the second report by Guillaume Autran <gautran@mrv.com>,
which has some allied characteristics, but after analysis it is something
impossible, read, cryptic and severe bug. :-( I did not get a responce
to the last query, so the investigation stalled.
