I was wondering if there was any reason that version numbers get really weird near release time...  Couldn't there be a standard numbering scheme for these?  I don't see why there was kernel 2.3.x, kernel 2.4.0-prey, kernel 2.4.0-testx,
kernel 2.4.0-testx/prey.....  Is it really necessary to have special version numbers?  If so, why not just stick to the 2.4-pred?  Or perhaps even
2.3.326pre or something....  Is there a reason that 2.4 pre-releases are not stored under version 2.3 on kernel.org?
