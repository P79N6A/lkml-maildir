Hi kernel gurus.
The IDE changes that went into 2.4.21-pre seems to make older procps
unhappy, at least the one in Debian 3.0r1 (latest stable). Upgrading to
a newer procps seems to fix this, but is this breakage really needed?
"Breaking" stable debian userland is not very nice :-)
I thought about notifying the debian maintainers instead, but somehow I
have this feeling this is just a little fixable detail in the kernel.
Yes, I'm 100% sure this system.map (both actually) is matching the
running kernel.
$ ps aux

Warning: /boot/System.map-2.4.21-rc1-s3 does not match kernel data.
{ide_dma_intr} {GPLONLY_ide_dma_intr}
Warning: /usr/src/linux/System.map does not match kernel data.
