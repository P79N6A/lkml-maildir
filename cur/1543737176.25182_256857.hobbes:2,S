Yup.

For you, the bigger patch shouldn't have made any difference. But it's 
needed for some other people who have BIOS'es that mark PCI regions as 
being reserved for the motherboard, and they get resource conflicts 
otherwise (resource conflicts that largely go away with 
"insert_resource()", but if we want to change that to "request_resource()" 
then that other patch is needed).
Can you send me your ioports from 2.6.9-rc3 _with_ the 
"request_resource()" change..
