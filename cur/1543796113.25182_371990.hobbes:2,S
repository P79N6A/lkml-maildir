So what I figured to be a good starting point isn't.
So I stepped back to the parent v4l-dvb dir, and did a 
cvs up -D 2005-11-1, which updated a whole bunch of stuff, and then I
get this:
[root@coyote v4l-dvb]# cd v4l
[root@coyote v4l]# make clean
.version:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.
[root@coyote v4l]# make
.version:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.
So it looks as if I don't know what I'm doing (and I obviously don't)
Where am I losing it here?
