It's unclear how latency enters the picture as the semantics of nice
levels relevant to such are essentially priority preemption, which is
not particularly easy to mess up. I suppose tests to ensure priority
preemption occurs properly are in order.
I don't really have a preference regarding specific semantics for nice
numbers, just that they should be deterministic and specified somewhere.
It's not really for us to decide what those semantics are as it's more
of a userspace ABI/API issue.
The timeframe is also relevant, but I suspect it's more of a performance
metric than a strict requirement.
