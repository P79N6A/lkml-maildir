I see MD and DM as quite different, though I haven't looked much as DM
so I could be wrong.
I see raid1 and raid5 as being the key elements of MD.  i.e. handling
redundancy, rebuilding hot spares, stuff like that.  raid0 and linear
are almost optional frills.
DM on the other hand doesn't do redundancy (I don't think) but helps
to chop devices up into little bits and put them back together into
other devices.... a bit like a filesystem really, but it provided block
devices instead of files.
So raid0 and linear are more the domain of DM than MD in my mind.
But they are currently supported by MD and there is no real need to
change that.

Only if I knew what 'everything needed for clustered operation' was....
There is room for expansion in the superblock so stuff could be added.
If there were some specific things that you think would help clustered
operation, I'd be happy to hear the details.
