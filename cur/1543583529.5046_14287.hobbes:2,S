That is going to be a SDA device and will have another form of content
protection like CPRM and Linux will not support that superset of features
at this time or in the future.  SMA's are on the hit list for music by the
SDMI.  If you want to use it as as standard ATA device cool, but the
0xD{0123} opt-codes are not public yet and fall under CFA.
Because it does not use a public spec and I can not release the private
one.....well you get the point.
