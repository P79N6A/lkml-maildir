The next obvious benefitor IMHO is module unloading. Just putting 
a synchronize_kernel() somewhere at the end of sys_delete_modules()
after the destructor makes module unloading much less nasty than it 
used to be (yes it doesn't fix all possible module unload races, but a 
large share of them and it makes the problem much more controllable)
