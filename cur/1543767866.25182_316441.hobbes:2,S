  This message means that ext2_new_block() got somehow tricked to
allocate a block in the place where inode tables, bitmaps or
superblocks are. I.e. the filesystem is probably corrupted. It's hard to
tell how that happened - you use some standard tools to create the above
described setup or it's just your own kernel hack?
