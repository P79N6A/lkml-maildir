Please note that this does not appear to be just a issue with the
powerpc build - I get the following failure whiole building a generic
x86 2.6.24-git7 kernel.
drivers/net/sis190.c:329: error: sis190_pci_tbl causes a section type
conflict
I suspect that you are ahead of me and alrealy knew this but I get into
trouble every time I make an assumption like that.
