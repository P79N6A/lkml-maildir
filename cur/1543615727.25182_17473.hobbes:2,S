FWIW, smbfs will want to know the servername + "share" used to mount it.
It will use that info to get smbconnect to do the proper magic to get a
new connection. So it doesn't have to be just printouts.
If this field is meant to be accessed by the fs code then I could put that
info there. Or someone could set it to dev_name in get_sb_nodev (if that
string is what I think it is).
Or I can do what I do now and pass it as a separate option and keep it in
a smbfs private area.
