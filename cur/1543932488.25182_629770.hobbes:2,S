Larry, thanks for being so patient so far. Tomorrow I plan to take my
laptop to somewhere with coffee and a wireless network. For now
though, can you tell me if these messages could be related:
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 7 of bridge 0000:00:05.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 8 of bridge 0000:00:05.0
or could tsc being marked as unstable have anything to do with the
speed of network transfers?
