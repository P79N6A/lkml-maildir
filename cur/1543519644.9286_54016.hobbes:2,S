I proposed that earlier in this thread. Please read all messages carefully.

The idea is fine, but:
1. It should probably be in the same place as the header files, since
   you need the path to the header files anyway. In fact /usr/src/linux
   would be a great default.
2. It should be position independant.
It should be in the form of a Makefile fragment like the first part
of the standard kernel Makefile. Paths should be relative to a variable
set earlier, so that you can do:
# Standard module Makefile
# Point to kernel you want to build against (default /usr/src/linux)
KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux
include $(KERNELSRC)/config.mk
config.mk sets TOPDIR to KERNELSRC and sets all the other variables
such as HPATH, AS, LD, CC, CPP, CFLAGS, etc. See the first 100 lines
of the standard kernel Makefile - it could simply be a copy of that
(taking .config into account)
