Ok I've investigated further and had a pointer from Andrew Clayton who fixes 
this problem with a gphoto2 upgrade. The issue is a libgphoto2 one and 
kernels 2.6.13+ will require libgphoto2 2.1.6 or later to work properly.
To sort this out before 2.6.13 comes out and it bites a lot of people - as 
most distros will have this problem - I suggest pointing them to the bugzilla 
entry as a FAQ:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5063
