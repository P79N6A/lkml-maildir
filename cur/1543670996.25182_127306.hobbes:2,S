100% would be stupid too. If the distro can pick a reasonable value,
the kernel can too. Thus the argument "push the problem into userspace"
doesn't do anything for me.

So if people want 0 volume for some reason, they can set *that*
in userspace. Windows can manage to do this without cocking it up. 
I don't see why we can't achieve it.
