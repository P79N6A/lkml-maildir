There is a small element of that.  Mostly it assumes we are running in the idle
thread until we call schedule.  Anyway the assumption and the code is out
there in the open in the main code path so it is easy to find, and the code works
today.
At this point I am queuing up patches that kill daemonize.  I will be
happy to revisit this part once daemonize is gone and the only interesting
file is kthread.c
