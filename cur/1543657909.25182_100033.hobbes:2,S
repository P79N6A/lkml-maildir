Interesting. OTOH, you ain't need nothing but plain 
evolution to see it happen: people thinking publicly 
on a mailing list like this one is just enough (and 
no "help" from a wicked monopolistic company is to 
be assumed ;) ).
I believe it's a property of a topic itself, whether 
it's something for a long discussion, or something 
superfluous. A topic we kill each other for is 
interesting on its own right: it is both irrelevant 
and is only a matter of coincidence when and who 
happens to be the firestarter. 
If an important issue that has the potential to divide 
us or has some other profound effect on our world here, 
one can be sure it WILL just pop up, and we WILL discuss 
it sooner or later, simply because such a topic needs 
to be resolved somehow...
It's just the nature of these intellectual things: 
different minds -- like winds -- shape the surface of 
our common landscape here, over long or short, calm 
or stormy, one-time or recurring debates.
