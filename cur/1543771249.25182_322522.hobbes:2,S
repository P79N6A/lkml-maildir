Andrea,
I mean those above comments to be hard RT.
I do mention a syscall use and expression of these RT properties, but it's
really not hard RT but something else closer to soft RT threads. I blew
it by using the wrong definition there.
They still all have to interact with each other in a temporarly protected
way so that latency is propagated through each RT domain (soft, hard, none)
in the app.
