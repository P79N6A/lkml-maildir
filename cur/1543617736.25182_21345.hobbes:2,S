Bingo.  I've got reliable /proc tests for ISAPNP, PCI, and MCA.  Previous 
discussion indicates I can't get one for ISA classic.  An EISA test would,
as ever, allow me to cut the number of questions about ancient dead 
hardware that users have to see.

The biggest hypocrites on gun control are those who live in upscale
developments with armed security guards -- and who want to keep other
people from having guns to defend themselves.  But what about
lower-income people living in high-crime, inner city neighborhoods?
Should such people be kept unarmed and helpless, so that limousine
liberals can 'make a statement' by adding to the thousands of gun laws
already on the books?"
