Yes, it can be done.

Well, if it is accepted by LKML, fine. [I did not realize someone is
actually working on it].
If it is rejected, tough, I believe openembedded etc. should just use
official interface.

Ok, I guess it all depends on LMKL and rmk's reaction. If LED layer is
rejected, I'd rather have something that can handle the simple
case. Hopefully enough cases (handhelds, IBM special leds, ...) are
there and LED layer gets accepted.
