Subject: [PATCH 0/4]: clocksource/clockevents for sparc64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/6/5

Here is a sequence of 4 patches that add support for dynticks
and high-resolution timers on sparc64.  I've tested this on
SunBlade1500 and a Niagara T1000 system.  I'm about to do
some tests on SunBlade100 as that has the other primary TICK
hardware type.
Any feedback or testing results are appreciated.  All patches
are against Linus's current tree.
Thanks.
