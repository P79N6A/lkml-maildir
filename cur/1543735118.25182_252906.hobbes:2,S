it would be nice if we could profile the callers of the spinlock
functions instead of the opaque spinlock functions.
the ebp trick is nice, but forcing a formal stack frame for every
function has global performance implications. Couldnt we define some
sort of current-> field [or current_thread_info() field] that the
spinlock code could set and clear, which field would be listened to by
profile_pc(), so that the time spent spinning would be attributed to the
callee? Something like:
spin_lock()
	current->real_pc = __builtin_return_address(0);
	...
	current->real_pc = 0;
profile_pc():
	...
	if (current->real_pc)
		pc = current->real_pc;
	else
		pc = regs->rip;
this basically means that we set up a 'conditional frame pointer' in the
spinlock functions - but only in the spinlock functions! It is true that 
this would be 1-2 cycles more expensive than using the frame pointer 
register but considering the totality of performance i believe this is 
wastly superior.
AFAIR __builtin_return_address(0) is nice and sweet on all platforms,
and it works even with -fomit-frame-pointers. (levels 1 and more are not
guaranteed to work, but level 0 always works.) On x86/x64 gcc derives it
from %esp so the overhead of setting up current->real_pc. On platforms
that have 'current' (or current_thread_info()) in a register, saving and
clearing current->real_pc ought to be a matter of 2-3 instructions.
(could be 2 instructions total on x64 - the same cost as
-fno-omit-frame-pointer ebp saving would have!)
->real_pc would have a small race window from the point it's cleared up
until it returns, but it's not a big issue because 99% of the spinlock
related profile overhead is either in the spinning section or the first
access to the cacheline. If there is some small overhead measured
spin_lock() it's not a big issue, as long as the brunt of the overhead
is attributed to the ->real_pc callee.
spin_unlock() doesnt even need to set up ->real_pc - making this
solution even cheaper.
hm?
