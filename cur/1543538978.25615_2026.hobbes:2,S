	Hi!
I have reported a problem yesterday which I have debuged today.
Between test2 and test4, some changes were made in console.c and one
doesn't seem to work properly on my computer. The offending lines are :
	if (redraw) {
                set_origin(currcons);
                set_palette(currcons);
                if (sw->con_switch(vc_cons[currcons].d) && vcmode != KD_GRAPHICS) {
                        /* Update the screen contents */
			set_palette(currcons);
                        do_update_region(currcons, origin, screenbuf_size/2);
                }
        }
set_palette was move from outside the if (sw->...) into the if.
I use XFree-4.0.1 and with this change if I move back and forth from xfree
and the vt, the palette isn't restored correctly, ie it's quiet impossible
to read on the console. The first time, the characters are a little
visible (contrast is lowered), but if I do that many times, the console
screen is totally black, in a unusable state (because i'm not very good at
typing without echo).
To circumvent this problem, I have made the following patch which works
very well on my computer (it restored the old way of doing this). By the
way my video card is a TNT2 ultra if it can change something.
