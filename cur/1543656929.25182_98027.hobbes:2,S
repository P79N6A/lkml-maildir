Perfect! Thanks for the fix, looking at it now it seems soooo obvious, /me
slaps himself in the face 8)
David, pleasey apply, I think there is still at least one bug with this code,
will be testing this as soon as possible.
Anders, if you're feeling brave, from the top of my head, think about what
happens if somebody only reads the first, say, 10 bytes of /proc/net/tcp, will
we unlocking a not held lock at tcp_seq_stop, no? :-)
Another fix for this one will be apreciated 8)
