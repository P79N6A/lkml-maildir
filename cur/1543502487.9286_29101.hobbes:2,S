Can I offer the enclosed bash shell script, which uses the available
information to reconstruct the partition table ready for it to be
recreated using `fdisk -u` (ie, this provides sector numbers).
There are two cases where it will get the details wrong:
 1. It assumes that the whole of the first track of cylinder 0
    is unused, and reserved for the partition table. On some
    systems, only the first sector thereof is unused.
 2. It assumes that all allocated partitions are consecutively
    allocated (ie, there are no gaps between them). This is not
    always the case, but it is usually true.
In addition, this version fails to detect the boot partition. However,
if you use LILO to boot, that can be determined by reading the
relevant line in /etc/lilo.conf although if you use LOADLIN or some
other boot loader, I've no idea where one would look to discover that.
If it gets the details wrong in other cases, please let me know,
providing a copy of the output from `fdisk -l` together with the
output from this program...
Best wishes from Riley.
