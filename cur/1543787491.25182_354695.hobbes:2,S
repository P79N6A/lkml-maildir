Subject: Re: [RFC][PATCH] identify in_dev_get rcu read-side critical sections

In reviewing the 44 kernel uses of __in_dev_get and seeing many 
cases in 13 of 20 C code files of insertions of rcu_read_lock with 
and without the rcu_dereference that is indicated, so it does appear 
often to be programmer intent.  
Of the programs using __in_dev_get that don't include rcu, devinet.c 
and igmp.c use an rtnl lock.  Five other programs that use __in_dev_get 
without rcu have rtnl locking in the program source code, but I need 
to actually look further into the call tree to say more.
Are there three cases then?  RCU protection with refcnt, RCU without refcnt,
and the bare cast of the dereference? 
Thank you very much for getting it back on track.
