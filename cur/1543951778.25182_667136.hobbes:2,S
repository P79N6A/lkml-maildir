Hi!
There are problems with usb after suspend/resume... it works as long
as memory is limited to 3G -- probably because iommu/agpgart/something
is not used in such case.
rmmod/insmod of ehci_hcd & ohci_hcd fixes that.
For testing with 2.6.25, you'll need aperture_64.c patch that makes
iommu as nosave (or it oopses).
Problem is also present in opensuse10.3.
