Subject: [TRIVIAL, PPC64] Remove #include processor.h from div64.S

Andrew, please apply.
This patch removes a redundant #include of processor.h from
arch/ppc64/boot/div64.S.  I came across this because, at least with
the binutils versions I have currently installed, the 32-bit assembler
used for the bootstrap code objects to the // comments that recently
went into processor.h.
