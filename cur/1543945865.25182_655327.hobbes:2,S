     Driver core: convert block from raw kobjects to core devices
     This moves the block devices to /sys/class/block. It will create a
     flat list of all block devices, with the disks and partitions in one
     directory. For compatibility /sys/block is created and contains symlinks
     to the disks.
Apparently, compatibility is in the eye of the beholder - in this
case, LVM.

Setting
CONFIG_SCSI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y
does not help. The problem persists.

Setting
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y
does indeed fix the problem and allows me to boot successfully.
Pity, I was so happy getting rid of that a couple of releases ago.

I'll have to investigate how to do that without breaking anything.
