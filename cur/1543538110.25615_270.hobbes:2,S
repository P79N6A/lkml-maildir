Have the list reflectors been configured to block adelphia.net by any
chance?  I've not received anything from lk since Saturday, nor do I get
any response from majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu.
Others tell me that the list is not dead, so can anyone help?  Naturally,
E-Mail is the only way to reach me.  
Sorry for the noise..
