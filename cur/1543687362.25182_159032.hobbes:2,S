Sorry, but my reading is this "An implementation of the ( Address Resolution
Protocol (ARP) [LINK:2] ) ..."
Do you understand what I mean?
If you insist on RFC-826 being only one of several (possible) ARP
implementations, can you then please name an RFC where ARP as a protocol is
clearly defined? I mean there must be one, or not?
