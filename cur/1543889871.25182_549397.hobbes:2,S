That's equally moronic that saying that "some people might prefer to
write 'f() void;'", which is what it's *EXACTLY* equivalent to.  Yes,
they might "prefer" it, but it's syntactically invalid and the compiler
won't accept it.  As it shouldn't.
__noreturn here takes the syntactic place of the return type, because
that's what it IS.
