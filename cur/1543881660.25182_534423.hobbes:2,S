Ummm... If things would be that simple... I think we need
struct page (*alloc_page)(struct address_space *mapping, int order, int 
node, gfp_t flags)
node = -1 means abitrary node otherwise try to alloc on indicated node.
additional_flags are important to be able to specify GFP_THISNODE to 
force alloc on one particular node. Plus there are the cpuset 
context flages etc. If the allocation is atomic then the callback should
be able to react to that appropriately.
