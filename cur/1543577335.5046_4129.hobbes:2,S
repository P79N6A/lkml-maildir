Looks fine, Marc.
I note that hashbin_unlock() does a restore_flags() where
the flags were passed in as an argument.  This doesn't
work on SPARC.
Conveniently, hashbin_unlock() is not actually used anywhere.
So I suggest you kill that function altogether, test
it, slap your name on it and send it to da man :)
