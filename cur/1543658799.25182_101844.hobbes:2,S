Sure, it's here:
ftp.suse.com:/pub/unitedlinux/1.0/src/kernel-source-2.4.19.SuSE-82.nosrc.rpm
This RPM contains the individual patches as well as the specfile to create 
the kernel-source.rpm. It's only missing the vanilla kernel source tarball 
in order to save space (this tarball is available on every other ftp 
server in the internet anyway).
For creation of the individual binary kernel RPMs you need the following 
source RPMs which are of course also available:
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        18972 Oct 21 21:45 k_athlon-2.4.19-111.src.rpm
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       168055 Oct 21 22:28 k_debug-2.4.19-79.src.rpm
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       186467 Oct 21 22:04 k_deflt-2.4.19-120.src.rpm
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       178477 Oct 21 22:04 k_psmp-2.4.19-115.src.rpm
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       185329 Oct 21 22:21 k_smp-2.4.19-113.src.rpm

Any chance you could check the facts before accusing people publically?

Because they are probably not too lazy to check the facts before offending 
people.
