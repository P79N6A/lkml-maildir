Why should home users have to reconfigure/recompile the kernel at all?
All device drivers should be modular, including the boot device driver.
(That would require smarter boot loaders that can find and load it off
a file-system using BIOS/firmware calls, plus a way to add a module to
the kernel before booting.)  Any necessary reconfiguration should be
possible at run-time, through tools that maintain /etc/conf.modules and
the loader configuration file.
Here's a couple of other kernel problems I see for `normal' computer
users, and indeed for myself:
* Poor support of removable media (common to most Unix systems).
  Under AmigaOS, I can eject and insert disks as I want; the volumes
  are mounted and umounted automatically; the OS understands that
  devices and disks are *not* the same thing.  I think it's the same
  under MacOS.  In Linux, no can do.  I understand that one can do
  tricks with eject, amd, etc., but those don't come close to the
  ease-of-use of the Amiga system.
* Poor ISA PnP support.  It's difficult to support well at all, but
  the fact that it's currently done by a user-land tool that is
  independent of kernel resource allocations is a serious problem.
  I suppose everyone's hoping this will go away soon...
