That patch was not enough. The BUGs were still showing up the same as 
before.
I tried to debug it myself. I've found an interesting thing in 
kernel/printk.c:release_console_sem(). There is the following sequence:
   spin_lock_irqsave(&logbuf_lock, flags);
   /* ... some code ... */
   spin_unlock(&logbuf_lock);
   call_console_drivers(...);
   local_irq_restore(flags);
I know very little about locking, but I didn't like this two-phased 
unlock. So I replaced it with a single spin_unlock_irqrestore. Patch 
attached.
I'm almost certain that there is a reason for the two-phased unlocking 
and that this patch will break something, but so far it works for me. 
netconsole now works without complaining.
