2.6.x and 2.4.x kernels on RedHat 9.0:

Briefly, here are the numbers for the most recent kernels:

A summary and a detailed report of the current failures on 2.6.10 is
available at:

I've run into some issues with patch-2.6.11-rc1 and the latest LTP, but
will post numbers when I've sorted those out.
