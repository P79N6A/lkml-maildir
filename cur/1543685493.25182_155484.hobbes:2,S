It has been observed, yes.

It is a very common case.  It's one we need to care for.  Especially when
lots of CPUs are hitting the same file.
There are things we can do to tweak it up, such as adding a max_index to
find_get_pages(), then do multipage lookups, etc.  But not doing it at all
is always the fastest way.
