If some code does:
	local_irq_disable();
	<fiddle with per-cpu stuff>
	kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL);
	<fiddle with per-cpu stuff>
	local_irq_enable();
or
	local_irq_disable();
	<fiddle with per-cpu stuff>
	function_which_calls_cond_resched();
	<fiddle with per-cpu stuff>
	local_irq_enable();
then we want might_sleep() to warn about the bug.
The fact that a couple of scheduler-internal fastpaths happen to know that
they can call schedule() with interrupts disabled is not relevant to this.
