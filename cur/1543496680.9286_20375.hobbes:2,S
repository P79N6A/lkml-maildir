I am sure many poeple here have noticed the huge list lag
that occurs on all the mailing lists hosted by vger.rutger.edu
Anyone know if they plan on upgrading the machine or who to talk
to about this issue? Its quite annoying to send a message to a mailing
list and have it show up nearly 48 hours later. 
Thanks.. Mike
