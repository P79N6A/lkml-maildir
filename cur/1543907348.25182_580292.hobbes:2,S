No, as far as reported into this thread, it's all been PS/2. We can leave 
this thread be though. It's nothing to do with CFS and is a non-debuggable 
problem sofar unfortunately. Although very present at the start of this 
thread, I haven't experienced my stuck delete key since. Teresa and Indan 
have the same problem (well, "non-problem" that is). If it's still lurking 
somewhere, we'll see it resurface at some point.
Rene.
