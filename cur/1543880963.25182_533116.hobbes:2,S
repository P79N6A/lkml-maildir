They are fixed in mm tree, as part of the patches which backports ext3
block reservation code to ext2. filesystem block numbers are all
ext2_fsblk_t type(i.e. unsigned long)(see ext2_new_blocks()). Maybe need
a round of thorough review to see if anything left, but I think what in
mm tree looks good.
And those patches in mm tree also backports the ext3 best-effort
allocates multiple blocks code (allocate multiple blocks within the
block reservation window as much as possible), FYI.
