Hi everybody,
I am not sure to whom should I address this, it's about a buggy
keyboard controller (I guess) found on <subj> laptops that has a
peculiar behavior with some key sequences.  Specifically, when you
press a shift (ctrl, alt, shift) and a key - (mostly when you play a
lot with shifts, like in emacs :-)) - sometimes the controller ignores 
the repeat delay and repeats the key, sending very close (tens of
miliseconds) key_down interrups (kbd MAKEs).
Since this become very frustrating in time (imagine an emacs where
meta or control sequences get out of hand) I have modified the
handle_scancode function in drivers/char/keyboard.c to ack like a
forced kbd delay.  In other words, for each new (different from the
previous one) scancode it sets up a delay (of 200 ms) in which it
ignores the same scancode, if received within this window.
I think this may as well be left there, I cannot think of things that
might be broken by it, the second  aparition of a scancode being
always protected by the kdb delay (min 250 ms on PC kbds) - on sane PC 
kbds, at least... therefore the 200 ms does not do any harm to the
normal kbds :-)
Anyway, I would be grateful if the person in charge (Linus?) would be
so kind to accept this patch, so I will not be doomed to patch by hand 
each and every kernel from now on :-))
The code is as follows, and should be placed immediately after the
variable declarations in the abovementioned function:
        /*
	 * Begin patch for Toshiba Satellite 2595XDVD.  Under some
	 * circumstances, its keyboards behaves like ignoring the
	 * kbd repeat delay.  This happens in conjunction with shift
	 * keys (ctrl, alt, shift) and leads to undesirable repeat
	 * of a key even if pressed briefly.  Fix it by ignoring any
	 * subsequent occurence of the second identical scancode for
	 * 200 ms. IMO, this doesn't break anything on a good keyboard.
	 */
	static int prev_scancode = 0;
	static int stop_jiffies = 0;
	
	/* new scancode, trigger delay */
	if (scancode != prev_scancode)  
	    stop_jiffies = jiffies;
	/* same scancode, accept only after the delay */
	else if (jiffies - stop_jiffies >= 20) 
	    stop_jiffies = 0;
	/* glitch!  bail out...  */
	else 
	    return;
	prev_scancode = scancode;
        /* End Toshiba patch.  */
Thanks!
