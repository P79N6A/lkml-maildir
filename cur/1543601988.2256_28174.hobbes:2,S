I had something similar on my dev box (2.4.[789] / Dual PIII-750 / Via / 1.5G 
/ Adaptec 2940 / three striped IBM DCHS-09Y 9.1G) and found that compiling 
the aic7xxx driver with TCQ disabled got round the problem. A far from 
perfect solution, I know, but it may get you up and running and maybe
provide some more clues as to what is happening.
