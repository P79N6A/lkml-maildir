I see this too on 2.4.14.  The boot messages indicate that one is
fixed-feature, whatever that means, and is being ignored.  But there are
still two entries in the /proc tree.
I'm also getting a crash when I try to shutdown -- NULL pointer dereference
because something-or-other gets passed a NULL scope.  Is this the right
place to report this, or should I be sending that data to another list.
