Heh.
I'm actually usually very easy to predict:
 - when it comes to "core technology" bugs, I'd much rather fix them
   _right_. To the point where I prefer to not fix them at all if the fix
   is only hiding the real bug. Then I'd rather leave it as a known bug
   and hope the _real_ fix comes in.
 - but when it comes to things that are more about "usability", I tend to
   try to take the very practical approach. So we'll disagree on things 
   like "should the kernel autodetect", because I think that's a usability
   issue, and consider that it should be as easy for users as possible.
The reiserfs/ufs issue to me is about "usability", not "core technology".  
As such, to me it falls under the "practical" heading, and the solution
should be the pragmatic trivial "just test reiserfs first" kind of silly
thing.
