Zeroing not mapped buffers in case of error is not difficult, indeed.
I was speaking about the following case:
 - one page of a file is dirtied through a userspace mapping,
 - the page doesn't have disk mapping yet (a hole),
 - someone issues write() to this page,
 - the space allocation fails in commit_write(), when the page content has
   already been overwritten with the new data.
Any holes in this scenario? :)
How to handle -ENOSPC in this case?
