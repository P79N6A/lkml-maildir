Ok, here's a modified patch that fixes the problem for me. As you
noticed, it seems the changed flag need to be one-shot, but your
code that "made" changed didn't follow that logic. Note that in
it's current form, the "new" function is equivalent to getting rid
of the "changed" flag completely and just returning the result of
ub_sync_tur(). I'll let you do that though if you think it's
correct.
Ben.
