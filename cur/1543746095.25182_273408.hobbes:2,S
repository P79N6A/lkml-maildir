OK. I tried 14 instances of jack_test. I even modded Florian's original
source code, to let each client instance have 4 ins and 4 outs, and to
make things a litle bit heavier, all 4 inputs are mixed into each of the 4
outputs.
Saw at least a couple of XRUNs in a 20 (4*5) minute test-run. CPU load
doesn't get above 30% on my laptop (P4/UP 2.533Ghz).
On attach you may find my "4-multiplex" version of jack_test(.cpp), along
with the jack_test3.sh shell script which has been used for my test runs.
There's also a modified version of nmeter(.c) that served the purpose to
log system performance counters (CPU usage, IRQs  and Context Switch
rate).
Bye.
