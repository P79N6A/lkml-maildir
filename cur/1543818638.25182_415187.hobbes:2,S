With plugsched-2.6.16 your staircase sched reaches about 40 then slows down, 
maxing around 100.  Setting sched_compute=1 causes console lock-ups.
With staircase14.2-test3 it reaches around 300 then slows down, halting at 
around 500.
Your scheduler seems to be tuned for single-user multi-tasking, i.e. 
concurrent tasks around 10, where its aggressive nature is sustained by a 
short run-queue.  Once you go above 50, this aggressiveness starts to  
express itself as very jumpy.
This is of course very cpu/mem/ctxt dependent and it would be great, if your 
scheduler could maybe do some simple on-the-fly benchmarking as it 
reschedules, thus adjusting this aggressiveness depending on its 
sustainability.
Thanks!
