This patch series cleans up a few outstanding bugs in netpoll:
- two bugfixes from Jeff Moyer's netpoll bonding
- a tweak to e1000's netpoll stub
- timeout handling for e1000 with carrier loss
- prefilling SKBs at init
- a fix-up for a race discovered in initialization
- an unused variable warning
This patch set was tested over repeated rebooting with both tg3 and
e1000 and random cable disconnection, with and without SMP and
preempt. Please apply.
