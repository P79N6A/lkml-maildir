The latency problem seen on the laptop turned out to
be a stupid mistake on my part: I enabled the ALI15XX
IDE controller option as a module instead of in kernel
and so it was not available for using DMA mode. Once
corrected the latency is running at a smooth 20us without
the >5ms spikes associated with PIO IDE.
Final Diagnosis:
server latency problem = USB wakeup_hc() delay added in 2.5.68-bk11
laptop latency problem = user with dain bramage
Thanks,
Paul
