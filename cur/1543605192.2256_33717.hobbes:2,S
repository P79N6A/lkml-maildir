Hi Linus,
the appended patch adds myself to MATINAINERS for the personality
handling.  The code was orphaned for a long time and I did a rewrite
that got into 2.4.11.  I also maintain linux-abi, the patch to support
foreign personalities under i386 (more architectures to come).
If someone wants to take the role instead speak up NOW or remain silent
forever :)
	Christoph

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
