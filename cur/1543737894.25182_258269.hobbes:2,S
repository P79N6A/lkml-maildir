I would argue that the testing should be the other way around: having people
argue/provide data why 2.5 is better than 10.  Is there any prior measurement
or mailing list posting out there?

Is it possible that whatever the tweak was done before, was running with
broken load balancing logic and thus invalidates the 2.5 ms result?

Yes, cache_decay_tick is what I referring to.  I guess I was too concentrated
on ia64. For ia64, it was hard coded to 10ms regardless what cache size is.
cache_decay_ticks isn't used anywhere in 2.6.9-rc3, maybe that should be the
one for cache_hot_time.
