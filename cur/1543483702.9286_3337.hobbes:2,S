True.

Right, but I don't think it's an issue and I am not going to change it.

The point is that you marked the bh while do_bottom_half() was running on
the other CPU and the bh you marked will wait for the next
do_bottom_half() to run. Yes, it could be more finegrined, but as just
said I don't think it's an issue...

Fixed.

Which? ;)

I don't think this is an issue too (and it's sure not a race ;).
