But the gathering of the "random" data from interrupts is not terribly
portable, and the kernel has at least as good an idea of how much entopy it
has gathered as a user-level app does.
Plus, /dev/{u,}random is there when you need it, if the system has been up
long enough (and /dev/random hasn't been used lately) then you'll have the
random values available immediately.
However, I think it's the intimate knowledge that the urandom device driver
can have of the system's entropy-generating characteristics that is most
valuable.

What awful irony is this?
