I have a shared memory stresser anyway if you want.  However, when we
originally took out the lock map, it proved _very_ hard to reproduce the
race, and only a couple of people reported problems.  Plain stress
testing with random access patterns over a day or more did not show up
the problem.  
These races can be very nasty and hard to trigger.  You really do need
to think the change through rather than just try-it-and-see.
