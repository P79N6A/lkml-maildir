As I said in my answer to Andrea, OOM killing is about allocations not being 
able to succeed (aka VM not being able to free pages).
kswapd is freeing pages, he is the one who knows about progress.

Right, we need to handle the NUMA case correctly (we need to which does "dont kill if other nodes
have available memory").
But still, it looks the right thing to do to me.
