Just to clarify - in either mode, if you don't have a consumer or the
consumer can't keep up with the amount of data being written by the
kernel, you will of course lose data at some point.  Normally you
wouldn't want to lose data; by using non-overwrite mode you're
implicitly letting relayfs know this i.e. if at any point all the
sub-buffers remain unread and the kernel is still trying to write into
them, let the client know (via the buffer-full callback) that this has
happened.  Presumably you would then increase the buffer size or have
the kernel write less etc.

Yes, I'll make it more explicit in the documentation.

Glad to hear it.  Can you say what if anything would convince you it
should be merged?

No problem, and thanks for patch and other suggestions.
