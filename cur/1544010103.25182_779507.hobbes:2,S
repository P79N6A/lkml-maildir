Actually, there are several other considerations:
     1. struct page is a lowmem structure, so increasing its size
        becomes problematic on x86 PAE systems.
     2. The current 64 bit struct page seems to be exactly pushing a
        cacheline boundary.  Increasing it so it spills over will have a
        performance impact
It's the performance problems that will be most critical, I suspect, so
you'll need mm people buy in for doing this.
One thing that leaps immediately to mind is that you could isolate this
to the net layer by putting it in skb_frag_struct.  However, such a move
would require a proper API for this in net ... right now it looks like
you're using the struct page addition to carry this information from
SCSI to net, which is a bit of a layering violation.
