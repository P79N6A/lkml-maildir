Or looking at the symlinks under /proc/<pid>/fd/1
Or opening something under /proc/net/ and calling get pwd.

However it is fundamental that monitoring programs want to inspect
the namespaces of other processes.
In theory the resource group stuff was suppose to provide us with
all of the names we would need.  However the semantics seem a bit
to flexible to use for something like this.

I meant a per mount filtering.  Exactly like we do for the pids now.

Not exactly.  It is about process attribute visibility.  Which
is what proc is about.  In plan9 where the concept comes from
namespaces are referred to as process groups, and that is a valid
view.  At least from a monitoring perspective.

Yes.  Because the static entries are beginning to depend on process
specific attributes.  We have already started with /proc/mounts.

The best is an id I can take with me when I migrate from machine A
to machine B.  An id in some namespace or a form that doesn't need
an id at all is the core requirement.
