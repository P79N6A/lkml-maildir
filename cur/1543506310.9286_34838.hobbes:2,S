I think that you can hold the bits high on the parallel port (not sure about
that), but maybe not through the existing parport driver (also not sure).
However, FWIW, putting a latch in your hardware might be the way to go
anyway.  That way you could probably use the regular parport driver to
output a byte, and if your computer goes off, your device can keep its
state.  You device would be more like a normal parallel port device and
respond to the strobe signal to latch the bits from the parallel port into
itself.
