This is exactly the point that I'm trying to make (and Nigel hinted
something along these lines). These problems have obviously been solved
in suspend2 (and I've got a machine to show it). Solutions are right
there. But for some reason, we are back to the drawing board.
I suggest you guys ask Nigel as to what he changed to make this work. I
don't think he just put the code there at random.
Look, I know I'm going to get blamed here for all kinds of things, from
starting a flame war to being incompetent because I'm not a kernel
hacker. That's cool. All I know is that somehow, somewhere, there are
chunks of code in suspend2 that make things work. If I didn't know
better, I would say it must be by magic :-)
