Sure, but the same kind of app can also do this on 32-bit architectures.
Assuming there's only 2.5GB of address space available per process,
you'd need 1638 cooperating processes to do it.  OK, that's a lot but
the lowest limit I can spy on a quick poll of multiuser boxes I have a
login on is 3064.  Most are above 10,000 (poll sample includes Debian,
RHAS and Fedora).
I think it would be better to check for overflow of the atomic_t (atomic_t
is signed) in the mmap routines.  Then kill the process that caused the
overflow.  OK, this is a local denial-of-service if someone does it to
glibc, but at least the admin should be able to reboot the box.
