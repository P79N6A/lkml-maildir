The maxtor drives
	XxYYYyZ
where 
	X is a number
	x is a letter
	YYY is the capacity (040 for a 40G)
	y is a letter
	Z is a number. 
When Z = 2, the disk is single platter, and COULD have been 4 times as
large by adding three more platters. That adds up to 160G so the 
Xy040z2 drives will certainly do LBA48.
