> > PPP does not work on my machine (it does on kernel 2.0.36)
I was confused for a bit getting ppp to work with the new net sysctl
setup; did you enable ip-forwarding and proxy-arp for the right
interfaces? See Documentation/net/ip-sysctl.txt if this might be the
issue. This probably is obvious to continuous bleeding-edgers, but I
stopped using 2.1.xx kernels when umsdos was broken, and only just got
around to trying 2.2.0preXes recently.
I'm doing fine connecting a 2.0.34 (vanilla old Debian 2.0 486)
machine to a 2.2.0 machine (Debian 2.1 + hacks, dual PPro 200 ) via
pppd 2.3.5 @ 28.8bps now that I got the sysctl/proc stuff worked out.
