One point is that 'obviously correct' is much harder to 'prove' for
threads (or processes with shared memory) than you might think.
With a state machine, you can 'prove' that object accesses won't
conflict much more easily.  With a threaded or process based model,
you have to spend considerable time thinking about multiple readers
and writers and locking.
One metric I use to evaluate program complexity is how big of a
headache I get when trying to prove something "correct".
Multi-process or multi-threaded code hurts more than a well written
state machine.
