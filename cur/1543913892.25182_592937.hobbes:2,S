Oh, I was pretty sure it wasn't.  OK.
So now why three versions of immediate_set()?  And why are you using my
lock for exclusion?  Against what?
Why not just have one immediate_set() which iterates through and fixes
up all the references?  It can use an internal lock if you want to avoid
concurrent immediate_set() calls.
I understand the need for a "module_immediate_fixup()" but that can also
use your internal lock.

Why is it easier to patch the sites now than later?  Currently it's just
churn.  You could go back and find them when this mythical patch gets
merged into this mythical future gcc version.  It could well need a
completely different macro style, like "cond_imm(var, code)".
