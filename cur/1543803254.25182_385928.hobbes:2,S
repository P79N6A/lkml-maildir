This is a re-send since the lists ate my reply.  I've also
trimmed out all but netdev and lkml email addresses.

I'd create a generic function that handles most things, but allow the
driver to over-ride this method if it knows better.  Something like
is_ok_to_add(new wlan device info);
might need an is_ok_to_remove(foo); as well.

If we can send a raw ethernet frame at the driver/stack, then it can
reject or send as needed.  For instance, you should be able to 'bridge'
to a regular station interface _IF_ the source MAC matches the station's
source MAC.  This would also allow the packet-socket code to work with
wifi just like it does with wired ethernet (and 802.1Q VLANs, for that matter.)

I wouldn't...can't see how it helps anything.

One thing multiple in-kernel stacks might give us would be an easier way for
developers (especially those not fully versed in wifi)
to try out features of both stacks and make merging between
the stacks easier (with the goal of having only one stack).  It would probably
allow more drivers to get in immediately as well, which should get
more developers working on the same core logic.

With regard to conflicting virtual devices:  How about treat all 'DOWN'
devices as irrelevent to the physical device.  That way, you can have
rfmon, AP, station, etc devices all configured at once, and just ifdown/ifup
the one(s) you want to use at any given point.  The virtual interfaces can
keep all config info needed to bring themselves back online.

Ignore for now..maybe it will get more active maintenance when the
stack solidifies enough to make developing wifi less complex.

Would it be possible to write a very thin 'shim' stack that could
sit over either device-scape or the current stack?  This shim could
start solidifying the API with user-space somewhat independently of
the lower levels.  If one stack did not support a particular feature,
then it just returns a failure code.  If this is not too much work,
it might allow the stack merge to happen gradually.  Of course, this
might be more work than it's worth...
Thanks for all the work you're doing!
