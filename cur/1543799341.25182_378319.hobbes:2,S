heya pavel,
thanks for the tip.  as it turns out, a function table was hacked-n
that back-link from the w100fb framebuffer resume function into the
LCD code.
in this way, it is possible to call functions in the LCD module
doing GPIO to start the power-up sequence required for the
LCD and backlight, wait a few ms, initialise the video chip
(in the w100fb code), then call _another_ set of functions in
the LCD module to finish off the initialisation.
not pretty, but there you go.
