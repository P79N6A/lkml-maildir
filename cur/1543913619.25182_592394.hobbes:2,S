Uh, it seems that I'm getting different results this time. Now,
X86_64_ACPI_NUMA does select ACPI, but PM (parent of ACPI) is not
automatically selected. Same result for the compile, though. Boom.
I seem to get different behaviour in general on subsequent runs of make
menuconfig.
For example, the last time I ran it, I was able to select K8_NUMA and
X86_64_ACPI_NUMA, independently of one another.
This time, though, the visibility of K8_NUMA is dependent on whether or
not X86_64_ACPI_NUMA is selected.
Should K8_NUMA and X86_64_ACPI_NUMA both be under NUMA, and independent
of one another?
