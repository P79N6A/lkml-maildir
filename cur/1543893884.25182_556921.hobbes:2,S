I believe a number of people don't think the GPL v3 is in the same
spirit as the GPL v2.  I guess it comes down to what people thought the
spirit of the GPL v2 was.  There certainly seems to be a variety of
opinions on that, and I am not sure the FSF's opinion on it agrees with
what most others believe, but that would be rather difficult to
determine.
