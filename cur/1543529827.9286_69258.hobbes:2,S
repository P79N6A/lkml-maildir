Hi All,
I'm a student at University of Southern California taking advanced
operating systems.  I'm planning to
write a paper benchmarking Redhat Linux 6.1 and FreeBSD 3.4 on a Pentium
500mhz for its application level performance and network server level
performance.  I also intend to run lmbench as well as Ousterhout tests.
I would like to know if there has already been a comparison paper written
within the past year making this comparison.  I also would appriciate any
pointers (papers, website, general comments, etc.) that would aid me in
writing this paper.
I appriciate your comments in advance,
Regards,
Koroush Saraf
