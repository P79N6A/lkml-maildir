It is still under development.  The vendor will likely
distribute it in source code form with the product installation disk,
since it is likely to undergo far more frequent updates that the
base kernel driver.
This allows them to decouple the portion not needed at boot-time,
from the more difficult to change kernel code that has to be
there to boot the system on RAID.
