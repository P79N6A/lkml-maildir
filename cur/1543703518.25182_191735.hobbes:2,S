FWIW, I think a 32-bit chunk-size is preferable.  I personally don't 
think "dead,beef" is easier to read than "deadbeef", nor "0073,0f0f" 
compared to "00730f0f".  On the small CPU count, ie: <=32, either 
version is pretty readable, but on larger CPU count boxen you're going 
to overflow your brain counting groups of 4 versus groups of 8.  I can't 
believe I just called a 32 CPU box "small".  My world perspective is a 
bit skewed... ;)
Also, on the input side, a lot of apps will output a 32-bit CPU mask. 
With commas separating every 32 bits, we can feed an "uncommafied" mask 
to the kernel and it won't barf.  If we go with 16-bit chunks, we'll 
have to "commafy" these 32-bit bitmasks to feed them to the kernel.
As a NUMA guy who deals with largish CPU count machines daily, that's my 
2 cents...
