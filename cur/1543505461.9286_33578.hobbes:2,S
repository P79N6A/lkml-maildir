Hi again, folks,
I am using a call to kernel_thread to create a process from within a
system call.  This process loops forever doing something, and waits for a
semaphore inside the loop using down_interruptible().  I am having a hard
time killing this process using "kill -" TERM or 9, and it totally hangs
the system on reboot (when Linux says "Sending all processes the TERM
signal").  How would I get rid of such process if I had its PID?
Thanks for helping me, again.
Stan
