Hello,
Sorry if this is NOT related to kernel per se. but...
Compiling a kernel module with and without "-g" gcc flag, 
(rest of the compiler flags remaining exactly the same/usual) 
changes the offsets/addresses of some (not all) symbols 
[saw using nm(1)].
Is this normal? I thought "-g" just adds debug info into the object
file. and it should not change the offsets/addresses that
symbols get assigned during compilation.
btw I am using gcc 2.96 (from RH).
Thanks
A.
