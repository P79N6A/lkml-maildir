    No, it never makes sense.  If you are going to use the BIOS defined
    geometry at all, then you should never vary from what the BIOS is
    using.  If someone actually thinks that it does help then they need to
    learn to set their system up properly.

    Not every user that uses boot parameters has a clear understanding of
    what those parameters do no matter how much documentation I write.  I'll
    take the word of the SEEPROM config over the boot option when available
    thank you.
But I do not thank you.
Unfortunately I have a certain visibility as fdisk maintainer,
author of the Large-Disk HOWTO, answerer of lots of geometry questions
on the net. It happens regularly that I have to send people a kernel
patch because the kernel does the wrong thing in their situation.
You are creating more of such cases. I am unhappy about that.
Maybe you do not realize how time-consuming it is to find out
what the user's problem is and then to construct a kernel patch
that probably will help him. It is a thousand times faster to say
"try the `extended' boot parameter".

    So.  If the user is experienced enough to go around tinkering with start
    and end cylinders on their disk, then they get what they get
You say: if the user happens to use certain versions of Windows NT
on an Alpha then you don't care what happens. Too bad. I do care.
    ...  But, more directly to your complaint, it's easy
    enough to tell when the partition sizes you deduce from the disk don't
    match the capacity (or even come close) and fail on the partition based
    geometry detection.  If you get fairly close, then you know you did the
    right thing.  There's no myth about it except in your mind.
Ah, Doug - you are angry and start writing nonsense.
0. LILO and fdisk want to know H (the number of heads) and S (the number
of sectors per track) and the total disk capacity.
1. Now you come and look at a partition table.
In the great majority of the cases you can read off H and S from
the ending (c,h,s) of the first nonempty partition, since you will
usually have H=h+1 and S=s. There is no way to derive the number
of cylinders or the total capacity from the partition table.
Since BIOSes usually do not tell you what the number of cylinders is
because they are afraid of mentioning numbers above 1024, the only
sensible thing is to set C = capacity/(H*S).
There is nothing to compare to see whether you did right.
It is fairly common to have partition tables that do not cover
the entire disk.
(And all this is assuming a DOS-style partition table, but people
also use other kinds of partition tables, look at genhd.c and see
what variation Linux supports today; trying to look at sector 0
will certainly fail for such other partition table types.)

    ...  Case 3, you have a disk that was formatted on an NCR (or
    other) SCSI controller and it uses some stupid ass geometry layout.  You
    put it in on the aic7xxx controller.  If we don't get the geometry from
    the partition table, the disk is useless until it is repartitioned and
    reformatted.
Why is that? Linux does not use the geometry part of the partition table,
so Linux will work fine. Fdisk will also work fine, only warn you that
some partitions do not end at a cylinder boundary, which may give problems
with DOS-type software and Partition Magic. LILO will also work fine
as long as the driver returns the geometry that the BIOS will use at
boot time.
Now you change the driver and make it report a geometry derived from the
disk. LILO does not work anymore, but that is easily fixed by inserting
the `linear' keyword in lilo.config. (But now LILO loses the ability of
warning you for stuff past the 1024 cylinder boundary, and some people will
find at the next reboot that they have a system that doesnt boot anymore.)
Fdisk does not warn anymore, but that does not mean things have improved:
the warning still applies, and DOS-type software can still destroy your
disk - the driver has only hidden the potential problems.
In short: letting the SCSI driver look at a partition table only has
a cosmetic effect: certain fdisk warnings go away.
You have destroyed information, and no longer reveal to fdisk/LILO
what geometry the BIOS will use for this disk, and accomplished nothing.
Some people will have problems because they also have DOS on this disk.
What do I have to tell them? Fdisk has to rewrite the geometry fields
of the partition table. But using what geometry? The kernel no longer
tells us, so I have to mail such people a kernel patch, removing the
driver part that looks at the partition table.
I hope you understand my unhappiness.
