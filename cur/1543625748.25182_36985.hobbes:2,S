The recent junk I fighting with to take full advantage of overcommit
accounting is squid.
Very popular junk. Maybe rsync uses same 'secret technique' to handle malloc
failures? :)))
Btw. Overcommit handling not very good yet.
Squid hits the limit, then bails out. Then shell script trying to start new
instance of squid (actually trying to sleep before restart), but gets 
'fork - cannot allocate memory'. seems that memory isn't dealloced 
from already exited process space :(
