All,
Can someone inform me of the POSIX compliance/Conformance of the Linux 
Kernel, esp. for module (driver) development.
Posix.1 (1003.1)
Posix.4 (1003.1b)
etc....
I have made attempts to use (Posix semaphores) in my LKM, but find 
no POSIX support in /lib/modules/<uname -r>/build/include/unistd.h
Any help is appreciated...
M.
