Ok, narrowed it down to one option in the kernel: smp
I can run this etup with everything identical with the exception of
turning on SMP.
The system was previously working with a buslogic card with 2.2.1 and
SMP.
As much as I would love to be able to include error logs, etc. I can't
because this is all I get to:
 ... Okay, now booting the kernel.
And then, nada. Only way out is through the little button on the front
of the machine.
Thus, it appears to me, that the driver is at fault. Any other
suggestions (or pathces :) more than welcome.
