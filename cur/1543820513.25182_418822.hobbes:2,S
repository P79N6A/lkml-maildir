Subject: [PATCH] likely cleanup: remove unlikely in sys_mprotect()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/25/237

With likely/unlikely profiling (see the recent patch dwalker@mvista.com sent), on my not-so-busy-typical-developmentsystem there are 5k misses vs 2k hits. So I guess we should remove the unlikely.
