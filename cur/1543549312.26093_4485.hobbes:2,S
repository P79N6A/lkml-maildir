Part of the 2.5 Makefile redesign is adding LINK_FIRST and LINK_LAST
entries in Makefiles.  The link order will be $(LINK_FIRST), (the
rest), $(LINK_LAST).  Link first and last entries will be done in the
Makefile defined order, the rest will be linked in alphabetical order.
And there will be a great big note: Do not use LINK_FIRST or LINK_LAST
unless you really (and I mean *REALLY*) have to!  All reasons for using
LINK_FIRST and LINK_LAST must be documented.
To handle newer controllers which mimic older controllers, the newer
controllers would be listed in LINK_FIRST.  At the moment we do not
have any plans to allow user ordering of controllers via .config, only
via editting the Makefile.  The plan is to clean up the Makefiles
first, introducing new facilities comes later (if ever).
