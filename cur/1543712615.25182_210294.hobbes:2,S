I agree with Bill on this.

No - bitmap wants these invariants, and I wanted bitmap to be
consistent.  It's an exposed API in its own right.  Since it mostly
already had filtering of unused bits on Boolean/scalar ops, and
avoidance of setting unused bits on proper calls, I completed that
model.
For masks, I promise not to set them if you don't screw up, but I don't
add any code to protect against such, and I don't hestitate to presume
the unused bits are always zero whenever it is convenient to do so.
