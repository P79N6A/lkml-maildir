Yes, lvm.c and lvm-snap.c are missing from drivers/md/. 
Additionally, drivers/Makefile needs to be modified: If you use lvm as a 
module, and do not use md, the md directory is not included in MOD_SUB_DIRS.
I just added 
ifeq ($(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LVM),y)
SUB_DIRS += md
MOD_SUB_DIRS += md
else
  ifeq ($(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LVM),m)
  MOD_SUB_DIRS += md
  endif
endif
and now lvm works again. I don't know if this is correct if both md and lvm
are used, as then MOD_SUB_DIRS will contain 'md' twice.
