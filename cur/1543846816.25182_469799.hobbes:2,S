The default values of my system are:
SO_SNDBUF = 16384
SO_RCVBUF = 87380

I tried the same scenario with SO_SNDBUF = SO_RCVBUF = 8k, so that the 
max memory is ca. 2G
and the oom-killer kills my application at the same time (at 140000 
connections).
I can not see in the messages that the system is out of memory,
there is also no swap space used
You can download my /var/log/messages at 
http://hemaho.mine.nu/~biber/messages
May you can give me a hint which line/value in the log shows me,
that the system is out of memory?
Thanks in advance
