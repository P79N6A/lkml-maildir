Not if TCP does not retry for the duration of your "connected" window,
say 5 minutes...
Also, I'm not convinced TCP resets the timeouts when they are so large
so much as takes them back down slowly.  This is useless if your
connection disappeared for a few minutes and then TCP takes longer than
you have left to recover.
