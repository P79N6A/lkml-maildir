Why are they nasty? My impression is that they give you a cleaner API in
the sense that you know that when you need something from e.g.
linux/hdreg.h you can simply include this file without bothering which
other header files are needed by this file. The only problem I'm currently
seeing is that circular dependencies between header files might be a
problem but it shouldn't be too hard to check that there are no circular
dependencies. Are there any other problems I don't see?
TIA
