Exactly.

GRUB must not write to the fs, so it probably plays back the journal in
memory only and it does this for every file it reads (at least that's how
it feels :-)

We already sync inside the kernel, it does not help here, though.
Blockdev freezing might help.

Yes, that's what i always advise: /boot on separate ext2 partition. Then
GRUB resumes fast.
