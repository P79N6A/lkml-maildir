Hmm. This failed when using -Os while linking vmlinux (gcc 4.0.2):
  AS      arch/x86_64/lib/putuser.o
  CC      arch/x86_64/lib/usercopy.o
  AR      arch/x86_64/lib/lib.a
  GEN     .version
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1

This patch was applied on top of the previous 6 in the series from
Arjan. NB that it _did_ build with 3.4.4 and -Os enabled. I'm
rechecking, but this is the second time I've encountered this failure.
