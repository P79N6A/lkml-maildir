Subject: Cause Isolated--parport (2.3.13-18 no boot on i486)

FYI:
Have finally isolated the cause of not booting past 'Ok, booting 
the kernel' which began with 2.3.13.
The cause was a parport directive in lilo
  append = "mem=32M parport=0x378"
Removing the parport directive, boots fine, runs fine.
Looking at Documentation, would say that parport directive is correct. 
Note, machine has no pci bus.
(Had previously been focusing on mem area, but turns out
everything I did that worked also took out the parport, which
I was not even considering a potential problem.
Moral: Don't assume.)
