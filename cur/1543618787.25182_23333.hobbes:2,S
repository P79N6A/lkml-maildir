Subject: [PATCH] Make ide-scsi compile in 2.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

ide-scsi doesn't compile currently in 2.5.x. This patch fixes it in a 
rather hackish way by adding some kmap_atomic()s.  It would be 
probably better to kmap earlier in process context in the request 
function instead, but I leave this to the people who know more 
about IDE/block layer than me (but apparently not compile ide-scsi..)
I'm also not totally convinced that it is deadlock free here to use
KM_BOUNCE_READ here, it may be safer to add a new bounce type. 
You have been warned. 
I have only tested it without highmem and it works for me. 
Hopefully there will be eventually a better fix, but for now it 
allows to burn (and mount if you use /dev/scd* for ide) CDs under 2.5 again.
