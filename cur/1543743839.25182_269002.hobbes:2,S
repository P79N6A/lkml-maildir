Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick 
to panic.
As jeffmock notes in 
http://tinyurl.com/6lmwp,
 the Apple iPod lies about its
size. It hurts particularly badly in this case, since if you access the iPod
beyond its real (not advertised) size, it locks up, and as some partition
tables (EFI) are stored at the end of the device, it locks up on the instant
you plug it in.
Note that contrary to what Jeff says, the error is only one sector. Maybe he
tried to read using the block device and got bitten by readahead.
