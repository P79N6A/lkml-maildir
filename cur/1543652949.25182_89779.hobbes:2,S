I'm not sure we really want this to be 3-level as that'd involve 
replicating all the categories underneath. The OpSys field type 
suggestion as an independant field would be nice, but the Bugzilla 
code will need some tweaking to support possibly different default
owners dependant on that field.
For now, Jon has created us an "Alternate trees" category, with "ac" 
and "mm" components, with appropriate text in the template to encourage
people to file bugs that happen (only) on those trees under the 
"tree-specific" categories, and we can move bugs out from there if 
need be. Hopefully that will make people happier for now, there may
be a cleaner solution long-term, but that needs more thought and more
work.
