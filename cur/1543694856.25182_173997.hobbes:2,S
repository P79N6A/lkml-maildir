Been in the tree for about a week - removed it though (0.2), so only
have 003 presently.  I also missed the /etc/hotplug.d/default/ symlink,
so initial integration needs tweaking.
So far have not had any complaints, except for minimal support at this
stage, but hey, its still early in the game =)
Also, I am using ramfs for now to do the device nodes, and have not
looked at minimal /dev layout, although I guess it is not that minimal,
as even the input drivers lack udev (sysfs) support currently it seems.
Wat was the last eta for initramfs again ?
