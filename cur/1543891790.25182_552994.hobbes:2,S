could you send me the /proc/PID/sched file of that task which shows this 
2-3 seconds delay? (if it's a shell and a graphical terminal then please 
send the sched-debug file of both.) I suspect the latency goes away if 
you strace -f the shell task(s)? If not then please send the strace 
output too.
