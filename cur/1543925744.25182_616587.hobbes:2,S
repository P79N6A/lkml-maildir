Hi Linus,
Please can you revert commit 62d0df64065e7c135d0002f069444fbdfc64768f,
entitled "Task Control Groups: example CPU accounting subsystem" ?
This was originally intended as a simple initial example of how to
create a control groups subsystem; it wasn't intended for mainline,
but I didn't make this clear enough to Andrew.
The CFS cgroup subsystem now has better functionality for the
per-cgroup usage accounting (based directly on CFS stats) than the
"usage" status file in this patch, and the "load" status file is
rather simplistic - although having a per-cgroup load average report
would be a useful feature, I don't believe this patch actually
provides it. If it gets into the final 2.6.24 we'd probably have to
support this interface for ever.
Thanks,
Paul
