I don't think transparent compress-on-flush can be done efficiently in
userspace.

There's more to it than that.  It is also for certain interfaces that
makes more sense in kernel space, or are there for historical reasons.
For instance, a filesystem could be done in userspace, with a userspace
library, but even FUSE uses the kernel for its interface, rather than
(say) glibc.

Right on all points.  Just remember that some change is good.  Why do we
have ALSA now?  Everything a user can do with ALSA, they can do with
OSS, AFAIK.

Point well taken, although sometimes that's exactly what you want.  You
no longer need the -p flag to Tar that way, although you would want its
opposite, so that you can ignore '...'

I'm not sure if the '...' or '..metas' directory is currently available
in Reiser4, but at one point it was the default, then it got changed to
a mount option which is off by default.

Reiser4 is attempting to extend POSIX without breaking it too much.

Not my department.  It seems that people are agreeing on what needs to
be done, though.

Still pretty annoying, but maybe a good idea, especially if the shell
gets extended to support it.  Not sure I like using inode numbers,
though -- I like the idea of being able to symlink to stuff inside the
meta-file dir.
Actually, I like this.  Give me some time to let it percolate.
Hans, thoughts?  Seems to be namespace fragmentation, but seems usable,
less breakage, and so on.  And should it be /attr or /meta?
