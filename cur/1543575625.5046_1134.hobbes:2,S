Hey guys,
Any one else experiencing problems when they do lots of disk activity
in test12?
I was able to grab the tail end of an oops. Probably not too usefull.
Code: 89 42 04 89 10 b8 01 00 00 00 07 43 04 00 00 00 00 c7 03 00
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
In interrupt handler - not syncing.
If I Alt+SysRq+s I get more oops (only tails again) and if I do it
enough times it hits a BUG and reboots immediately.
