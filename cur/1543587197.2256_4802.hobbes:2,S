I'd do that if this wasn't also my Windows 98 gaming machine - I'm supposing
that the Windows drivers do use the IRQ even if XFree86/Linux doesn't. I
dunno if Windows is smart enough to assign an IRQ even if the BIOS doesn't.
Anyway, things are working now (specially since the last tulip patches) and
I like it that way :-)
