Hi,
I took WLI's suggestion and put together a little script that attempts
to gather some pertinent stats, (profile, vmstat, top), regarding
interactivity of the system.
I did a quick run that consists of refreshing a fat web page in mozilla
while playing a movie with mplayer. The movie still stutters slightly
during this test.
The results of the ten second run are here:
http://zeke.yi.org/linux/2.6.0-test3-mm1-prof/
And the script used was this:
#!/bin/sh
# Linux interactivity profiler script
# requires profile=2 (or 1?) as a kernel boot param
# Script takes optional number of iterations
# param., default is 10 iterations
# reset the profiler
readprofile -r
KERN=$(uname -r)
OUT_DIR=/root/profs
[ -w ${OUT_DIR} ] || OUT_DIR=$(pwd)
if [ -z $1 ]; then
        ITS=10
else
        ITS=$1
fi
# Collect vmstat output
vmstat 1 ${ITS}|cat -n > ${OUT_DIR}/${KERN}-vmstat &
# Collect top output
top b d1 n${ITS} > ${OUT_DIR}/${KERN}-top &
n=1
# Collect profile
while [ ${n} -le ${ITS} ]; do
        readprofile -n -m /boot/System.map-${KERN} \
        | sort -nr -k 3,3 > ${OUT_DIR}/${KERN}-prof.${n}
        n=$(( ${n} + 1 ))
        sleep 1
done
