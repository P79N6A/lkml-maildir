Hi,
my mouse, which is a Logitech cordless wheel mouse does not work fully 
under 2.6.
The wheel doesn't work; no events are sent.
The mouse is correctly identified:
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: PS2++ Logitech Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
I already tried with "psmouse_proto=imps" as kernel parameter, but 
without success.
Any hints anybody ?
Regards
Dominik
