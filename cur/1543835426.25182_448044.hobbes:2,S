I don't _blame_ drivers.  I only wanted to say this: "If Nigel knows that some
drivers need to be fixed and he has working fixes for these drivers, he
should have submitted these fixes for merging instead of just keeping
them in suspend2".  Period.
If I know of a fix for a driver, I always do my best to make sure the fix
will get considered for merging at least.  The problem is I'm not a driver
expert and I can't provide the fixes myself.

No, I'm not sure.  If I were, I would fix the problem.  Also I'm not quite sure
about the higher success rate of suspend2.

This is an offensive comment.

This also is offensive, because the current swsusp _does_ work for many
people.  Actually I've recently tried a couple of various machines on which
it "just works", so I will not replace suspend-to-ram with suspend-to-disk
below, sorry.
Moreover, if it doesn't and the problem is reported, we do our best to trace
it and fix it, but sometimes we just can't do this without access to the
hardware in question.

And that's very true.  For example, the suspend-to-ram doesn't fully work
on my own box and I'm not sure it ever will.  However, that's not a fault
of anyone who works on this, just broken BIOS and the lack of documentation.
This is worrisome and many people work on improving these things, but
the matter is notoriously difficult.
