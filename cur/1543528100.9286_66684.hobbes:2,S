If everybody needed to constantly monitor zombies, you would
be correct. It is more efficient to do things your way...
Normal systems don't have such a high zombie population,
or maybe you are just less tolerant of a few zombies.
Millions of Linux users would have to spend CPU time so
that you can more quickly count zombies.
This isn't fair.
