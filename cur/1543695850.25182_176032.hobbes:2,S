Could you add the following to the Regressions section?
- In 2.4 users of Japanese keyboards were able to type '|' or
  '\' characters without loading any custom keymap on the
  console.  With the keymap in 2.6, this is not possible
  anymore.  People with these keyboards have to load a keymap
  with loadkeys rebuilt from the source, since loadkeys in some
  vendor distributions cannot load keycodes larger than 127.
  There is a patch to fix this, but it has not been integrated
  (
