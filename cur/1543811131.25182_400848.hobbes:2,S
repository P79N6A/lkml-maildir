That's because everyone's terribly busy chasing down those final bugs so we
get a really great 2.6.16 release (heh, I kill me).
I'm a bit reluctant to add changes like this until we get the smpnice stuff
settled down and validated.  I guess that means once Ken's run all his
performance tests across it.
Of course, if Ken does his testing with just mainline+smpnice then any
coupling becomes less of a problem.  But I would like to see some feedback
from the other sched developers first.
