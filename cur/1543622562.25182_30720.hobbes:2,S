Because the internal structure of the kernel changed. The kernel
developers are always changing the INTERNAL kernel stuff, hopefully
to improve performance. The only promise between kernel versions
is that the EXTERNAL stuff won't change, i.e., the API. But, even
this sometimes changes, things like the stuff in /proc.
So, if you are going to install a different kernel major version
number, you are going to need compatible third-party drivers and
sometimes, even new tools to compile the kernel.
Cheers,
