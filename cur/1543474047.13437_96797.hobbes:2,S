Hi,
I am running kernel 2.2.0-pre4, with pppd 2.3.5, I use a dial on demand system
for accessing the internet `pon provider' and I get disconnected from my ISP
after about 1 hour of connection. If I quickly re-connect it doesn't happen
again, but it is costing me phone calls so I thought I'd report it.
I know it isn't my provider, because it happens on both my ISPs, and I haven't
noticed it before when using an earlier (stable) kernel (1.0.36 or whatever it
is).
My modem is a Spirit 33.6kbps modem based on a Rockwell Chipset.
Thanks 
Will Lotto
