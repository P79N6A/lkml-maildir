This is EXACTLY why you do not need this patch in mainstream. I guess IMAP
was enough to break in your system but no crackers skilled enough to work
around no-exec patch tryed to break in. Wonder why ? EXACTLY since this
patch is not in mainstream kernel and easily foundable exploits do not have
work around for non-exec-stack patch (workaround for daemon like IMAP is
pretty simple as Theodore Y. Ts'o pointed out).
