Olaf, will you admit that the SLES9 code is crap now?
Andy, does just replacing the "__initdata" with "const" fix it for you? 
That should hopefully mean that IN PRACTICE the Linux version string will 
be the first one to be triggered, if only because init/main.c is linked 
reasonably early, and all the other "Linux version" strings will hopefully 
be in the same rodata section.
Sad, sad. We shouldn't need to work around tools that are so _obviously_ 
broken like this.
