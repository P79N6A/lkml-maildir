Yes it is. But rlimits are unsigned .-( (asm/resource.h says this).
I prefer rlimit match nice value too, but how to do this with unsigned.
And what do with the RT prio, different rlimit?
Btw: I saw this on a solaris command too, 0-39 for nice, 40-139 for RT
(dont rememer which).

You can do this already. "priority" item in /etc/security/limits.conf.
But they can only lower the priority.
This patch is for allowing to raise it.
