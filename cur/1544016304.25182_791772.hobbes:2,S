I have hit this pointless panic during testing, that's the motivation for 
this whole question. The initrd was unimportant in that bootup - but that 
is generally true of bzImage bootups.
And your argument makes little sense: if there is something wrong then one 
looks at the logs _anyway_. Are you suggesting that all warnings that 
signal some potential badness should result in a panic? That is 
nonsensical.
What you seem to be arguing for is to introduce a kernel option that says 
"panic on warnings" - so that folks cannot miss warnings. _That_ would be 
a fair argument.
Panics are rarely good, unless the user asks for it, period. We've been 
flipping over BUG_ON()s to WARN_ON() everywhere where it matters in 
practice.
