Why? I asume there will only be few programs requiring to be run by a
wrapper, and mv /usr/bin/foo to /usr/pfexec-bin/foo;
echo $'#!/bin/sh\n/usr/sbin/pfexec /usr/pfexec-bin/foo "$@"' > /usr/bin/foo;
chmod 755 /usr/bin/foo
should be easier than patching e.g. all callers of cdrecord, and it won't
slow down starting non-profiled applications.
Possibly the pfexec can tell the application to be run by the basename (like
su1), in this case you'd add something like
"alias cdrecord /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord" to it's configuration and link it
to /usr/bin/cdrecord.

That sounds reasonable, but I wonder how you can get access to a device
file descriptor in order to do unprivileged access.
