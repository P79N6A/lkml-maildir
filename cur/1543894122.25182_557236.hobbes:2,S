Direct or indirect results:
  - See Michal Piotrowski's periodic posts and
    
http://kernelnewbies.org/known_regressions
 .
  - Meanwhile, the people who maintain bugzilla.kernel.org seem to work
    on improvements.  I noticed that (a) each page now has a backlink to
    the bugzilla.kernel.org start page, (b) the show_bug.cgi=... page
    layout is now an unreadable mess, (c) e-mail integration is still
    the same (it's impossible at least for me to send e-mails to bugs).

BTS has been mentioned in that thread in a few posts; mostly positively
as I recall.
