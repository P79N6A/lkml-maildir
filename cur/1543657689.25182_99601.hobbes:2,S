This isn't good.  For example, NUMA platforms with per-CPU irqs want
to allocate the irq descriptors in local memory.  On ia64, we
introduced a minimal irq-descriptor API for this purpose:
	/* Return a pointer to the irq descriptor for IRQ.  */
	static inline struct irq_desc * irq_desc (int irq);
	/* Extract the IA-64 vector that corresponds to IRQ.  */
	static inline ia64_vector irq_to_vector (int irq);
	/*
	 * Convert the local IA-64 vector to the corresponding irq number.
	 * This translation is done in the context of the interrupt domain
	 * that the currently executing CPU belongs to.
	 */
	static inline unsigned int local_vector_to_irq (ia64_vector vec);
I think the platform-independent part of the code really would only
need the first routine irq_desc().  The other two are ia64-specific.
BTW: if you haven't done so already, I'd suggest to take a look at
arch/ia64/kernel/irq.c.  I tried to keep this code as close as
possible to the x86 version.  There shouldn't be anything in there
that isn't wanted for a good reason.
Thanks,
