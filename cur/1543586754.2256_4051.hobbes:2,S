Hi all.
Ok, maybe this isn't the right list for this question. In 2.2.x the
parport_probe module extracted the ieee1284 device id correctly and added to the
proc fs. However this doesn't seem to work for me in 2.4.x
I only have one device to test it on and since I know there have been some
difficulties regarding the device string's length bytes etc I post my device_id string here
the first two bytes says that length is 96 and the following is the string 
"MFG:Winbond;MDL:SA5459B;CLS:DIGCAM;DES:Winbond's DIGCAM driver can not be found in the system;"
I have tested to build, parport, parport_pc and ieee1284 both as modules and static into the kernel.
Is there some option I need to enable. As far as I understand the CONFIG_PARPORT_1284 should be enough??
Bye
	Jakob
