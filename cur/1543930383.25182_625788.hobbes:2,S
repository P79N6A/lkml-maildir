just to hammer this point home - and while Christoph Lameter isnt online 
currently to defend SLUB, this issue did come up and i guess there must 
be other MM hackers that are advocates of SLUB. (otherwise this code 
couldnt be upstream)
I find SLUB a fantastically confusing concept, and that starts at the 
name. "Unqueued" it says. Lets take a look at the actual code:
mm/slub.c:
  static void __always_inline *slab_alloc(struct kmem_cache *s,
                  gfp_t gfpflags, int node, void *addr)
  {
  ...
          local_irq_save(flags);
          c = get_cpu_slab(s, smp_processor_id());
  ...
          else {
                  object = c->freelist;
                  c->freelist = object[c->offset];
          }
          local_irq_restore(flags);
so it has a "free list", which is clearly per cpu. Hang on! Isnt that 
actually a per CPU queue? Which SLUB has not, we are told? The "U" in 
SLUB. How on earth can an allocator in 2007 claim to have no queuing
(which is in essence caching)? Am i on crack with this? Did i miss
something really obvious?
