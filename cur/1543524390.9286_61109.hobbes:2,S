rtl8139-diag reveals the following.  When the 8139 driver is a module:

  No interrupt sources are pending.
 The chip configuration is 0x10 0x2c, MII half-duplex mode.
Parsing the EEPROM of a RealTek chip:
  PCI IDs -- Vendor 0x10ec, Device 0x8139, Subsystem 0x10ec.
  PCI timer settings -- minimum grant 32, maximum latency 64.
  General purpose pins --  direction 0xf1  value 0x10.
  Station Address 00:E0:4C:39:00:A2.
  Configuration register 0/1 -- 0x2d / 0xc2.
 EEPROM active region checksum is 0974.
 The RTL8139 does not use a MII transceiver.
 It does have internal MII-compatible registers:
   Basic mode control register   0x782d.
   Basic mode status register    0x1000.
   Autonegotiation Advertisement 0x05e1.
   Link Partner Ability register 0x0000.
   Autonegotiation expansion     0x0000.
   Disconnects                   0x0000.
   False carrier sense counter   0x0000.
   NWay test register            0x0005.
   Receive frame error count     0x0000.
And when it's linked into the kernel:

  No interrupt sources are pending.
 The chip configuration is 0x10 0x0f, MII half-duplex mode.
I've chopped the rest because it's the same.  The one important difference
I see here is
   The chip configuration is 0x10 0x2c, MII half-duplex mode.
for the module against
   The chip configuration is 0x10 0x0f, MII half-duplex mode.
for the static linked driver. I'm guessing that the difference is perhaps
due to some kind of initialisation error.  I don't understand why it's
claiming to be MII though -- in both cases it's 10baseT and the link light
is on regardless of whether the network connection is actually working or
not.
