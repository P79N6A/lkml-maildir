Sorry, I could not get SMP 2.6.8.1 + voluntary M5 to boot on my dual
Athlon test system. Again problems with interrupts but worse than P9,
this time acpi=off or pci=noacpi did not help (I can boot single user,
but the machine hang in the network startup - or if I disable that,
later on X startup). I saw two messages, one "irq 9: nobody cared!" and
then "Disabling IRQ # 9" (that's the one for the network card). On a
different boot:
  Badness in free_irq at  .... irq.c
free_irq
load_balance_new_idle
floppy_release_irq_and_dma
set_dor
motor_off_callback
...
So I could not get to the point where I could test jack and SCHED_FIFO
processes.
