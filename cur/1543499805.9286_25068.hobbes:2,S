Well, hot-swap is in so early development stage in linux, now, that if
hot-swap is only reason you dislike devfs -- go for it.
It is currently not clear how we'll identify devices on USB (their
unique serial numbers are not that unique after all). Just solve
problems we have _now_ and then start developing hot-swap support into
kernel.
