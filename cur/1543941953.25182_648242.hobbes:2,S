while the HAL case of Atheros might be still true despite the fact that
an OpenHAL has been around for a long time now. The Intel argument is
out of the picture since quite some time. The regulatory daemon was an
interim solution and has been replaced by a proper firmware solution. So
please get your examples up-to-date.
You might wanna now point to hiding something in firmware, but the
hardware, firmware, driver separation (with being hardware and firmware
closed source) is an accepted solution. It is a clean separation.
Interface wise and license wise. Remember that nobody inside the
community ever asked for any kind of IP or trade secrets. We only want
specifications so we can write the drivers under an appropriate open
source license. If the specification describes an API exposed via
firmware then that is perfectly fine.
