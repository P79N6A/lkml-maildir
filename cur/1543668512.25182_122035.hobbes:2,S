Hello,
I've been playing around with the Chromium X15 web server (which I
downloaded some time ago). Recently, my linux box crashed and I lost
everything.  Fortunately, I had almost everything backed up.  However, I did
not have my X15-Beta-1.tgz backed up.  Unfortunately, Chromium is now
defunct and their original download site is unavailable.  Moreover, I have
been unable to find anyone affiliated with what was once Chromium who can
help me re-acquire the X15-Beta-1.tgz source file.  So, I'm trying to find
somebody on the Internet who might have a copy of the source code (which I
used to have).  When searching the Internet I came across several posts
indicating that individuals here might have a copy of the source.
Does anyone here have a copy of the X15 source code (X15-Beta-1.tgz)?  If
you do have it could you please Email me the X15*.tgz?
Thank you in advance for any assistance that you might be able to provide.
Or, alternatively, thank you, in advance for any thoughts or ideas you might
have in regard to how I can re-get the source.
Sincerely,
Dr. John Vincent Jaskolski
