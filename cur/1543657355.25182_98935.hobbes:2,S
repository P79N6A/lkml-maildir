I looked at SYSCALL once, and noticed some problems:
- it doesn't even load ESP with a kernel value, a task gate for NMI is 
mandatory.
- SMP support is only possible with a per-cpu entry point with 
(boot-time) fixups to the address where the entry point can find the 
kernel stack.
- The AMD docs contain one odd sentence:
"The CS and SS registers must not be modified by the operating system 
between the execution of the SYSCALL and the corresponding SYSRET 
instruction".
Is SYSCALL+iretd permitted? That's needed for execve, iopl, task 
switches, signal delivery.
What about interrupts during SYSCALLs? NMI to taskgate?
Either that sentence is just wrong, or SYSCALL is unusable.
It's not supported by the K5 cpu:
