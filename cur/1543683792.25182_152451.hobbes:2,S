Subject: i2o_block.c randomness patch
Hello,
I have a couple of servers that use only i2o raid controllers, no keyb,
no mouse, so they don't get almost any randomness. I think there's
need for a small patch on i2o_block.c file:
add_blkdev_randomness(MAJOR(req->rq_dev));
that should be added before line 449 (for the i2o_block.c found in the 
stock 2.4.21 kernel), the patched kernel looks like working fine.
What do you think about it?
Thank you.
Francesco Messineo
