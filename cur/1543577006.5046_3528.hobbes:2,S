You may just want to look at how C99 handles this using <stdint.h>;
stdint.h defines types of the following format:
	 int, uint		... signed/unsigned
	 <size>			... exact size
	 _least<size>		... no smaller than
	 _fast<size>		... no smaller than, and efficient
	 _t
E.g. uint32_t, int_least64_t, uint_fast8_t (the latter could easily be
a 32-bit type, for eaxmple.)
In addition, constructor macros are defined, as well as (u)intmax_t
and (u)intptr_t; which are defined as the largest
possible integer and an integer large enough to hold a (void *),
respectively.
In other words:
	(void *)(uintptr_t)(void *)foo == (void *)foo
