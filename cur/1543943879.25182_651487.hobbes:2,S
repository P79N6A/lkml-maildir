Subject: [PATCH] [0/8] Various kernel mapping bug fixes

Relative to git-x86#mm 05afd57b4438d4650d93e6f54f465b0cdd2d9ea8) 
The first bug fix is the most important one -- it fixes a boot hang
on gbpages systems -- the rest is for random issues I found while looking 
at the code. Several are related to EFI (see caveats in the descriptions), 
which looks very broken currently without these patches, but definitely 
needs more testing.
