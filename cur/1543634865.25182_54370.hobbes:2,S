The `index' in pagemap.h and filemap.c is an index into the pagecache,
not a disk offset --- so it stays as unsigned long.  I think there are
plans to change it to `pgoff_t', or to change the size of an object in
the pagecacheat some stage, but for now the
pagecache on a 32-bit architecture is limited to addressing 
((2^32)-1) * PAGECACHE_SIZE, which makes a limit of 16TB on 32-bit
architectures at present.
