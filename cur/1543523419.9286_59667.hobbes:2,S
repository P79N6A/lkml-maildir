SGI does ccNUMA, cache coherent NUMA.  The difference is that unlike in
`real' NUMA machines each processor on a node has access to memory in each
node directly.  A node in an Origin system is a dual CPU SMP system.

It's actually the start of the support for the Origin series but other
systems are expected to jump the wagon.

Ok, but users and application developers still want the entire system to
feel like a single system.
