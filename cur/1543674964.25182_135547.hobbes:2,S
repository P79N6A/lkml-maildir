As you see from Alan's message and others, it isn't pseudo-SCSI.
Besides what he mentioned, there is Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), where a 
host controller can simultaneously support SAS disks and SATA disks.  So 
it's either an IDE driver that does SCSI, or a SCSI driver that does 
IDE, or a driver that's in both IDE and SCSI subsystems, or... ?  Having 
fun yet?  :)

For all these reasons, I continue to maintain that starting out as a 
SCSI driver, and then evolving, is the best route.  The non-SCSI parts 
leave drivers/scsi, as they should.  The SCSI parts stay.  The SCSI 
mid-layer gets smaller.  All the while, the driver continues to work. 
Everybody wins.
Starting out as a native block driver and _then_ adding SCSI support and 
native queueing and jazz does not sound even remotely like a good path 
to follow.
