Yes, some drivers (e.g. maestro3, ymfpci) require now external
firmwares.  Try to install them from the latest alsa-firmware
package.
I already added new Kconfigs to choose whether external or in-kernel
firmware for 2.6.22.  Anything else should be as it was.  (The
replacement with quirk list helper doesn't change the functionality.)
