I don't know if it will do what you want 'out of the box'
if not then the sensible thing to do would be to route and setup:
          A ------------ C  C  ---------- B
192.168.1.1    192.168.1.2  192.168.2.1   192.168.2.2
and use iptables to do user space packet filtering.

I saw that ebtables can use iptables modules (with some hacking)
