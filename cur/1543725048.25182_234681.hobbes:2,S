We've had several requests for a real 64bit BK release for AMD 64bit cpus.    
It's in the download area and in kernel.bkbits.net:/home/bk, the file is
called bk-3.2.2c-x86_64-glibc23-linux.bin.
It passes full regressions, both command line and GUI, but there were some
compiler warnings in the tcl/tk build so let us know if you see anything 
that appears not to work, especially in the GUI area.
