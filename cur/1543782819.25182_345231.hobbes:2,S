You can ignore the patch easily enough. Ignoring the locking doesn't
work because functionality like fork process counting, exec, and setuid
all make definite assumptions that are not safe to tamper without unless
you fix the uid locking.
Fixing it might be useful in some obscure cases anyway - POSIX threads
might benefit from it too, providing the functionality of changing all
thread uids at once isnt triggered for sensible threaded app behaviour.
