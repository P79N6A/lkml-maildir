Exactly. And it's only the system keyboard which does it - neither mouse
movements nor network traffic (like hitting keys in the ssh session) or
other system activity (like compiling the kernel of the day) will do.
FYI, the issue is still present in 2.6.18-rc4 and 2.6.18-rc3-mm2.
Please let me know if you need more information or if you want me to
test something.
Thanks,
Tilman
