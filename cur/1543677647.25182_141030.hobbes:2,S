hi,
i have an alpha here, running 2.5.70 for weeks now. the patch to 2.5.71
applied with no errors (i did "make clean" before this) but it won't
compile:
# make vmlinux modules modules_install
...
   CC      arch/alpha/kernel/srmcons.o
arch/alpha/kernel/srmcons.c:269: warning: `srmcons_ops' defined but not used
make[2]: *** [arch/alpha/kernel/srmcons.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [arch/alpha/kernel] Error 2
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 2
------------
compiler is gcc3.3, .config did not change (new options in 2.5.71 with
"No" answered).
Thanks,
Christian.
