Hi All!
I am using a SATA driver.
I want to do zero-copy mechanism in the Application using this SATA driver.
Can I use kiobuf mechanism on SCSI Disk drivers.
Is there any source where I can know more on using kiobuf mechanism for SATA.
I came to know SCSI Generic uses this mechanism. Can SCSI Disk driver
do the same.
Regards,
deven
