IMHO the problem with classifying RxRPC as a "reliable datagram"  
socket is that even an atomic unidirectional communication isn't a  
single datagram, it's at least 3; there is shared connection state  
and security context on both sides which pertains to a collection of  
independent and possibly simultaneous RxRPC calls.  From the digging  
around that I did in the kernel socket code a while ago I don't see a  
cleaner way of implementing it than a new SOCK_RXRPC.
