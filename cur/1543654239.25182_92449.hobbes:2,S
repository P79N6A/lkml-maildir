Subject: [PATCH][2.4] update ref counts on all allocated pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/26/193

The following patch sets the ref count on all pages of an
allocation.  This allows an allocation with order>0 to be freed
via individual __free_page() calls within vfree().
This is important on non cache coherent processors which
have a pci_alloc_consistent/consistent_alloc() implementation
that involves creating a vmalloc area cache inhibited mapping
of allocated pages.
Because of this implementation, the implementation
of pci_free_consistent/consistent_free is done via
a vfree().  Without this patch only the first page
of the allocated memory is freed since successive pages
all have ref counts of zero.
