The caches are in part shared. Remember page cache memory and read only
application pages are the same thing - so its not that simple. I found 2.4.5
pretty bad. 2.4.5-ac seems to be better on the whole but I know its definitely
not right yet. Marcelo and Rik are working on that more and more.
Marcelo has a test patch to fix the (documented but annoying) 2x memory
swap rule stuff. The balancing problem is harder but being worked on.
If you can give Rik a summary of your config/what apps run/ps data then it
may be valuable as he can duplicate your exact setup for testing his
vm changes and add it to the test sets.
