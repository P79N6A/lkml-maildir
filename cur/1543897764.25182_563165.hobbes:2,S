There are dozens of companies selling Linux powered professional audio
gear, multiple pro audio centric distros, and hundreds of serious free
software audio apps.  I suspect these developers and their users would
disagree.
I agree with you about userland drivers but at minimum this would
require merging the -rt kernel patches, otherwise the latency/jitter
will be too high to do anything but toy desktop sounds, then you need
a mergeable mechanism for doing DMA and interrupt handling in
userspace.  It has been attempted before but never evolved to the
point where you could drive a complex device like the emu10k1.
