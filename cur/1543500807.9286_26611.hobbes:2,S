Well, I run SMP and got the same results that Marc got. Evidently none
of us was able to verify the supposedly massinve speed improvements
with the 2.3.8 kernel. I personally rather find it out here on this
mailing list than learn about it from Mindcraft ;-)
One interesting point though: When I did the kernel compile tests under
2.3.8, I would not only get higher sys times, but also higher user
times, which makes me wonder ...
Cheers
