Subject: [BUG] 2.4.23-rc1 USB2 (ICH4) ehci-hcd and usb-storage lockups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm seeing repeatable lockups with the USB ehci-hcd driver and
usb-storage under vanilla 2.4.23-rc1. The "magic sys req key" chords do
not allow recovery. 
Under the usb-uhci driver, all works well (but slowly ;-).
Recipe to recreate problem:
modprobe usb-storage with ehci-hcd already loaded. Mount an ext3
filesystem in external USB2->IDE case. Try to cp ~15Gb tar file to fs
mounted on /dev/hdc1 and the messages logged below are written to
/var/log/debug. After last message, console shows "usb_control/bulk_msg:
timeout" and system hangs. 
Config: SMP. Modularized everything relevant to USB. usb-storage
compiled with debug enabled (see log).
Chipset: Intel E7505 (ICH4 controlling USB2)
Dual Xeon 2.4GHz, 2 Gig RAM (CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y)
Relevant portion of logfile:
