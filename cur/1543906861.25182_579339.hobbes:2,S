That would make us standards compliant (POSIX explicitly says that
what happens after a unclean shutdown is Unspecified) and it would
make things a heck of a lot faster.  However, there is a potential
problem which is that it will keep a large number of inodes pinned in
memory, which is its own problem.  So there would have to be some way
to force the atime updates to be merged when under memory pressure,
and and perhaps on some much longer background interval (i.e., every
hour or so).
