Sure, it would be nice.  But it's really hard and not easy to implement.
The traditional unix filesystem forms a nice n-ary tree.  Symbolic links
turn your tree into a graph.  But, it is required, that the tree be
preserved by the hard links.  The soft links are just there to go
somewhere in different ways.  They do not _build_ the tree.
mkdir creates a new leaf node, unlink removes one, and rename moves a
subtree to a different location.  Checks like: you mustn't move a dir
to one if its descendants (meaning, you mustn't disconnect a subtree
from the main tree), are easy because there's only _one_ point where
this node is connected to the tree.
If you allow directory hardlinks (or loopback mounts) you get a completely
different structure: a directed graph with all it's problems (like rings).
Reconfiguring a graph with some constraints like: you mustn't isolate a
subgraph from the one containing the root node, is pretty hard.  You
have to scan the _whole_ graph to check this.  And, try to remove a
part of the graph.  There may be _no_ leaf nodes, only rings.  This means,
you have to allow to unlink non-empty dirs.  And this results in a garbage
collector...
Yeah, would be nice, but hard *g*
Ciao, ET.
