The assumption of buffer_heads having their data aligned to the power of 2
that the size of the buffer is at is widely present, and why buffers are
populated with pages (or aligned portions thereof).  If you're looking to
check for memory leaks, there are patches out there that do all the hard
work for you (memleak-something, I don't remember the url) -- no need to
reinvent the wheel.

If you don't lock the page, then you'll run into troubles if someone else
tries to read the same page, or the system tries to reclaim the memory.
Of course, such bugs will tend to only show up under high load.
