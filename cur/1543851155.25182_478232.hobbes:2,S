Development hasn't stopped, I'm just a slacker ;).  I was away from work
for a while, and on return I was sucked into various issues that have
now (hopefully) all been resolved (or routed to /dev/null).
We have several patches that have backed up in our bug database
(
http://bughost.org/cover/
 and click on 'tested patches') that I'll be
pushing to our GIT tree as well as releasing a new snapshot to SF.
We've also been working on some new code internally we're putting
through some testing before we push out.  Expect some good things in the
coming weeks.

We do what we can internally to ensure that is never the case.
