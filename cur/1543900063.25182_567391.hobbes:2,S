Probably not actually, -m16 might have 16-bit "int" etc.
-mabi=16 is closer to what other architectures do here.

Those would use -m16, yes.

Looks good, except you don't want -fno-unit-at-a-time if
-fno-toplevel-reorder works.  And of course it would be
good to get rid of -fno-strict-aliasing, but let's not
