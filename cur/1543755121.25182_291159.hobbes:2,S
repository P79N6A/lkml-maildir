There is at least one device that uses the same uart on a non-MIPS
platform. I'll submit a patch once I have it working.

Right. There is however one bigger problem with the original patch:
It removes the driver for tx3912 and adds one for tx3927/tx49xx.
AFAICS, the 3912 has a very different register layout from the other
chips, so the old driver must not be removed yet.
