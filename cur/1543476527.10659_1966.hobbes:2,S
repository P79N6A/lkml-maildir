Your files probably have holes in them.  Example:
1. Write a character at position 1
2. Seek +10M
3. Write another character.
The file is now 10M+2 long, but only two blocks have been allocated.
read()s will return zero, and you'll be able to read 10M+2 bytes from
the file, but stat() (and the stat program which ships with many
distributions) will say size=10M+2, blocks=2 (actually more for
indirect blocks).
tin is probably playing similar tricks.
Summary: everything is fine, don't worry.
Matthew.
