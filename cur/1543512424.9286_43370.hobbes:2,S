Manfred, Andrea - please stop it. Yes, it does and yes, it should.
Plonking the big lock around every access to VM is _not_ a solution. If
swapper doesn't use mmap_sem - _swapper_ should be fixed. How the hell
does lock_kernel() have smaller deadlock potential than
down(&mm->mmap_sem)?
If you want to return to 2.2 you know where to find it.
