While the first part is true, I really hope that the latter isn't.  Once 
you leave the small departmental file-server and start to get to larger, 
more capable servers (e.g. OLTP systems, etc.), the need for fault tolerance
and fault isolation becomes much greater.

Excuse me?   Who says you can't build a mainframe with commodity processors?
(SGI Origin 2000 - mips microprocessors,  IBM SP2 - PowerPC processors, 
UNISYS OPUS - pentium Pro processors, UNISYS HMP - Xeon processors).
(Besides, have you checked IBM's revenue figures for 1998 yet?   Their
software revenue alone was more than twice Microsofts in 1997, and I 
expect it to be roughly the same in 1998, and 1999).  IBM's total 
revenue may eclipse $100B this year - that is not from selling
PC's, by the way.
What market segment do you consider Linux suitable to fill?

Complicating the applications because you don't want to make the
operating system more robust is not a viable fault-tolerance 
policy in the long run.
