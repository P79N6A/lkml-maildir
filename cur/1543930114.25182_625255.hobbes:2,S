Subject: [PATCH] mmc: remove unused 'mode' from the mmc_host structure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This field and corresponding defines are simply never used anywhere
in the code.  But its mere presence is enough to confuse some host 
driver authors who attempt to rely on it.  Let's eliminate the 
possibility for confusion and remove it entirely.
