Actually, I've had a system when the hardware was failing and one CPU
lost it's bottle and thought it had less cache (and maybe was a
different speed, forget).
Anyhow, Linux did work with the exception of timekeeping was screwy
(hence I think the speed of one CPU was wrong and I had to reboot with
notsc or something until I got the CPU replaced).
