This patchset implements PVDMA for handling DMA requests from
devices assigned to the guest from the host machine.
They're also available from
git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/amit/kvm.git pvdma
These patches are based on my pci-passthrough tree, which is available
from
git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/amit/kvm.git
and the userspace from
git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/amit/kvm-userspace.git
The first and the third patch in this series is needed on the guest (with some
bits from the 2nd as well). The 2nd patch is meant for the host kernel.
Amit.
