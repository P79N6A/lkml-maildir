Is not this is one of those heavy-PCI loaded boxes that ocasionally corrupt
data when PCI is overloaded? 
The log you quoted shows that suddenly tree nodes have incorrect content
(and the i/o error is because reiserfs does not know what to do with such nodes).
(and we hope to push the patch that will print device where error have occured
soon).
