Compiling linux-2.2.0-pre2 fails as follows:
/u2/src/linux-2.2.0-pre2/include/asm/bugs.h: In function `check_config':
In file included from init/main.c:27:
/u2/src/linux-2.2.0-pre2/include/asm/bugs.h:354: `smp_found_config' undeclared (
first use this function)
/u2/src/linux-2.2.0-pre2/include/asm/bugs.h:354: (Each undeclared identifier is 
reported only once
/u2/src/linux-2.2.0-pre2/include/asm/bugs.h:354: for each function it appears in
.)
make[1]: *** [init/main.o] Error 1
make: *** [build] Error 2
The "guilty" code segment:
#ifdef CONFIG_GOOD_APIC
	if (smp_found_config && boot_cpu_data.x86 <= 5)
		panic("Kernel compiled for PPro+, assumes local APIC without read-before-write bug");
#endif
smp_found_config is defined in arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:
The relevant part of .config:
#
# Processor type and features
#
# CONFIG_M386 is not set
# CONFIG_M486 is not set
# CONFIG_M586 is not set
# CONFIG_M586TSC is not set
CONFIG_M686=y
CONFIG_TSC=y
CONFIG_GOOD_APIC=y
# CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION is not set
# CONFIG_MTRR is not set
# CONFIG_SMP is not set
