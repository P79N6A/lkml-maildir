hm, i still like Con's approach in this case because it makes 
independent sense: in essence we calculate the "human visible" effective 
latency of a physical resource: more CPUs/threads means more parallelism 
and less visible choppiness of whatever basic chunking of workloads 
there might be, hence larger size chunking can be done.

look at CFS's design and you'll see that it can easily take larger 
timeslices :) I really dont need any reinforcement on that part. But i 
do need reinforcement and test results on the basic part: _can_ this 
design be interactive enough on the desktop? So far the feedback has 
been affirmative, but more testing is needed.
server scheduling, while obviously of prime importance to us, is really 
'easy' in comparison technically, because it has alot less human factors 
and is thus a much more deterministic task.

90% of the testers are using CFS on desktops. 80% of the scheduler 
complaints come regarding the human (latency/behavior/consistency) 
aspect of the upstream scheduler. (Sure, we dont want to turn that 
around into '80% of the complaints come due to performance' - so i 
increased the granularity based on your kbuild feedback to that near of 
SD's, to show that mini-timeslices are not a necessity in CFS, but i 
really think that server scheduling is the easier part.)
