No.
The code is much simpler and much more straightforward, and it makes
sense. No "tricks" involved.
See it my way:
 - I have simpler code, with one less made-up bit of information. If you
   look at the patches, you'll notice that NOTHING actually ever needs to
   test the above combination - it just falls out as the natural
   behaviour.
vs
 - more complex code, with more state, that doesn't give anything new and
   adds more rules that have to be tested for.
So obviously I'll drop the BH_Hole bit - it isn't buying us anything at
all, and it _is_ setting us up for coherency problems.

I'll believe you when I see it. My motto is: never overdesign.  It sounds
like you're making up reasons to overdesign something that isn't needed.
