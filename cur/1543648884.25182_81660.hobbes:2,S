For the most part my preferences is to put the system into a sane state
when we reboot/shutdown.  The device_shutdown call in the kernel can handle
this, on reboot.  The problem with video is mostly that the drivers
are not well integrated.

The primary thing it does is give the kernel a working 32bit entry
point.

The code was built so I could put a kernel, a ramdisk, and a command line
all in a single ELF executable.    With the addition of entering the kernel
at it's unsupported 32bit entry point.  So I perform a different set of BIOS
calls that setup.S does.  Though they are very similar.
But why mkelfImage works occasionally when a bzImage doesn't and you
have a pcbios is a mystery to me.  I know why only mkelfImage works
under LinuxBIOS...

The meta-data is easy, about one line in vmlinux.lds.  Fixing the
actual entry point is more interesting.  I've done it and the result
is maintainable but the patch met some definitions of intrusive.
