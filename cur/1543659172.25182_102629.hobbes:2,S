I do not want it removed because it's a graphical frontend, or because
it's using Qt. I want it removed because it is an inappropriate package
to have it in.
All else being equal, code should not be in the kernel package. Please
explain the *advantages* of including it in the same package.
moc binary detection is broken, btw if the qt dir guessing is used (a
bad idea in the first place). That's just an obvious one, there are
undoubtedly other problems.
Sorry but it's just bizarre having patches for some GUI going through
lkml
