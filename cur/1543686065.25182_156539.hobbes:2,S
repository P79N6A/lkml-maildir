That's not true, unless you just count the remotes that come packaged
with the TV cards. But you might be able to buy all-in-one type
remote controls which work with the TV card's IR receiver (it's also
possible to connect a different IR-sensor to the TV card's IR input).
It would be nice to be able to configure the keys then.
drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/av7110_ir.c does it this way (default map
for Hauppauge, loadable keymaps in linuxtv.org CVS).
