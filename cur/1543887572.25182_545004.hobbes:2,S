Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This patch fixes a deadlock that has been reported by three different
users on recent kernels.  The problem exists on mainline kernels since
2.6.18.  It is included in linux-2.6.22-rc1.
JFS: Fix race waking up jfsIO kernel thread
It's possible for a journal I/O request to be added to the log_redrive
queue and the jfsIO thread to be awakened after the thread releases
log_redrive_lock but before it sets its state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.
The jfsIO thread should set the state before giving up the spinlock, so
the waking thread will really wake it.
