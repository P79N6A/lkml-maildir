I've made progress on the root cause (posted in another thread), but we
need to fix ib_srp.c:srp_remove_work() as well, as I think it will have
the same issue. It will only be hit if we cannot reconnect to the
target, so it probably doesn't see a lot of use.
I'll send a new patch to you for just the ib_srp.c side.
