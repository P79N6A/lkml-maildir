Hi,
there is a typo in line 1841 of arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c:
  #ifdev CONFIG_DEVFS_FS
should most likely read:
  #ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS
Also the spell-checking of Configure.help provides some amusement by
changing "SYN flood protection" to "SIN flood protection" and is
inconsistent wrt to changing "filesystem": most of the time to
"file system" but also to "file-system"... Not that this is overly
important.
Yours,
  Dominik
