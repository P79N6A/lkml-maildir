Except that the majority of CD writers today are NOT SCSI devices. They 
may use the MMC command set from SCSI for interface purposes, but they 
are on an ATA or USB bus. cdrecord tries to fabricate some kind of 
device numbering assigning SCSI-like bus and LUN numbers for the devices 
when such a numbering has no basis in any kind of reality.
We have all SCSI devices in a single namespace, that is what /dev is 
for. That is the name that the system/kernel provides for applications 
to use, and that is what the application should use, not some kind of 
bizarre invented numbering scheme built on top of that.
