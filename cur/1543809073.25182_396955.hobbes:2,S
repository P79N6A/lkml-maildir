Hi,
I need to test a keypad driver in 2.6.10. For that, to write a simple
application to read the device file and write it to display, dont I
need node to be in "/dev " ?.  But I agree, in 2.6, concept has been
changed. When I do
# cat /proc/bus/input/devices
I get
I: Bus=0019 Vendor=0001 Product=0001 Version=0100
N: Name="KBD"
P: Phys=
H: Handlers=kbd
B: EV=3
B: KEY=800 1681 0 38a14001 50004ffc
Ive gone through "Using the Input Subsystem", By Brad Hards, published
in Linux Journal. link: 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6429
How to use Handlers ??
dev fs entry is not created. But sys fs entry
/sys/devices/platform/keypad/driver/keypad/driver/keypad/..... goes
indefinitely. same is with
/sys/bus/platform/devices/keypad/driver/keypad/driver/..........
but couldnt find how to get a way to access kbd from user space.
Can any one have example ??
Please anyone, help me.
regards,
--pramod
