Ok, I see what you mean. This is not a radeonfb problem at this point.
The problem is in the fbcon layer in 2.6 which doesn't adapt to
resolution changes. I have done some work to fix this but it's
not completely right yet. I'll submit something to Andrew & Linus
once I'm happy with it.
The append= you need is radeonfb=, not radeon=
I don't think the cursor issue is related at all. And I don't know
what's up with the firegl binary drivers.
Ben.
