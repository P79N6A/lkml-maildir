Can you give any example of a real CPU where alignment matters?
Sure, it needs to be naturally aligned, but that's true of _any_ type in 
the kernel. We don't do unaligneds without "get_unaligned()" and friends.
Btw, if you want to leave out 8-bit and 16-bit data, that's fine. So 
generally you'd only need to handle 32-bit (and 64-bit on a 64-bit 
architecture) accesses anyway.
