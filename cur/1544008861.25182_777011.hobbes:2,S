If you view this as a "right" way of using barriers, then you can drop 
barrier support at all and replace this code sequence with:
 flush disk cache
 submit write synchronously
 flush disk cache
--- because synchronous barriers bring you no performance advantage over 
the above sequence.

And how does xfs preserve write ordering, if the barrier asynchronously 
fails with -EOPNOTSUPP and there are other writes submitted after the 
barrier?
