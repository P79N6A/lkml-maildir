This approach, while it would solve this particular problem, has a
grave flow. Consider the case where the first copy in the
original_syscall is to copy a user space structure, which has embedded
user space pointers... The set_fs() will cause future
copy_from_user/copy_to_user in original_syscall() calls to succeed
even if the user  supplied pointer is in kernel space.

Hear hear.
