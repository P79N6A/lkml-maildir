And after it compiles and depmod lists all the symbols which aren't
exported you rewite ksyms.c with:
/* all the crap missing from mjc2 */
EXPORT_SYMBOL(blkdev_varyio);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(pidhash_bits);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(pidhash_size);
Some of which is cruft you inhereted which will be fixed in 2.4.28-rc77, I
think one you created yourself.
Since the test machine take ~100min to build a kernel, I have just
finished the build and will boot Friday, assuming that rc3-mjc1 or so
isn't out.
for the record, 2.4.18-pre9-mjc1 did not run as well on the small machine
test as just rmap-12e+K3. I was hoping the preempt in mjc1 would make it
more responsive. I have a new test for thread handling, I want to run
that, and maybe Thursday I'll get to try all of these on SMP and large
memory systems.
Soon I have to write all this stuff up...
