Hi!
   You would place it in drivers/video. If you look at the Config.in
file in the linux/drivers/video directory you will see 
if [ "$CONFIG_PPC" = "y" ]; then
 bool '  Open Firmware frame buffer device support' CONFIG_FB_OF
 ...
fi
Just add you driver in that section. Also you have to alter fbmem.c. You
need to add something like 
extern int xxxmydriverfb_init(void);
extern int xxxmydriverfb_setup(char*);
and further down in the file. 
#ifdef CONFIG_FB_MYDRIVER
        { "myfbdriver", xxxmydriverfb_init, xxxmydriverfb_setup },
#endif
When you look at this file you will see what I mean. If you have any
further questions just go to

. In this email you
will see the address for our mailing list. On our web site it gives you
