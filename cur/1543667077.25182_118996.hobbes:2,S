    Let's look at ext2:
        if (S_ISCHR(inode->i_mode) || S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode))
            raw_inode->i_block[0] = cpu_to_le32(kdev_t_to_nr(inode->i_rdev));
    Should the saved device number be a 16bit or a 32bit device number?
    Has the user any control over it?
It used to be a 32-bit device number. If we want to store
a 64-bit device number then also raw_inode->i_block[1]
is used. Fortunately ext2 has lots of room there.
No, the kernel code does what it does - user space does not influence this.

    I mean via mknod, e.g. if the user has a major/minor number,
    how should it be converted to a dev_t number?
The proper way is using the makedev macro in <sys/sysmacros.h>.
But in times of change you have to do everything by hand.
glibc still has to be updated.
(Steal the MKDEV macro from the kernel setup.)
Since new dev_t is compatible with old dev_t you need not
recompile or upgrade glibc or so, unless you actually want
to use more than 16 bits.
