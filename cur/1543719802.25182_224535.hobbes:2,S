If we have a good detector that is reliable and easy to run, why not?
It will take some time, but I think the problem so far has been that the
recursion can be hard to see. Some "core" cases are well-known (memory
allocations during memory allocation, and filename lookup), and they 
should be trivial to annotate. Knock wood. Others might be worse.

Yes. And with huge stack hogs, we've not exactly "fixed them all in a 
weekend", have we? But having a few people run the checking tools and 
nagging every once in a while ends up eventually fixing things. At least 
the most common ones.
