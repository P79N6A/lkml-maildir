I think it would be good to have a mechanism to group free pages by 
purpose - so that if we break up a high-order page in order to allocate 
memory for process A, then the remaining pages remain in a special pool 
that the allocator will prefer to hand out only to process A.

Not following you here.  Is it valid to free an order-2 page that's not 
aligned at order-2?

Adjacent regions can happen by accident, and the uClibc malloc will try 
to merge free areas when they are adjacent - there's a lot of 
special-case code in there to prevent this on uClinux systems by 
essentially duplicating VMA tracking.  That's something we want to 
avoid, because it eats performance (especially in threaded apps due to 
additional locking).
