2.5.49 on an intel D850GB motherboard with acpi's on demand clock 
modulation for the P4 has a divide error: 0000 causing a kernel panic 
from attempting to kill init.
It's completely repeatable and just finishes the PCI acpi irq routing 
when it happens on boot.  The cpu i'm using is a 1st gen P4 1.7Ghz, 
non-xeon.
