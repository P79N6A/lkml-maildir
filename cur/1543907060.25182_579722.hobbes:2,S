Hi,
this more of an informational question. So:
kernel version is 2.6.22.1 on i686
/proc/uptime 
9917.81 9140.90 (2h45m)
/proc/cpuinfo:
           CPU0
  0:        282   IO-APIC-edge      timer
this is kinda neat, I expected much more interrupts than just 282 since 
boot. What kernel code actually uses the irq0 timer?
thanks,
	Jan
