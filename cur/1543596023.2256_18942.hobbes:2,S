	Please provide a real example.
	As far as I can tell, the only change would be to make
dep_tristate behave the way it was expected to, as in
drives/sound/Config.in:
      dep_tristate '    Netwinder WaveArtist' CONFIG_SOUND_WAVEARTIST $CONFIG_SOUND_OSS $CONFIG_ARCH_NETWINDER
	The current, unintended, behavior is to allow this module to be
built all all non-ARM architectures (and probably bomb out), as well
as the intended architecture of ARM-Netwinder, and not any other ARM
platforms.  The intended behavior, and the one that you would get with
either my change or Keith's is to only allow this module to be built
for ARM-Netwinder.
