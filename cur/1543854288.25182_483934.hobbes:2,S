    I must not that this whole ack() vs eoi() stuff is misleading. For example,
in 8259 driver, mask_ack() method actually sends EOI to PIC, not ACK's an IRQ 
-- the actual ACK is implicit on x86 and is used to read the interrupt vector 
form 8259 on PPC. So, IMO, there probably should only have been either ack() 
or eoi() method in the first place. Though I'm not familiar with ARM from 
which genirq stuff originated...
