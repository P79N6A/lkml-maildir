Per the comment:

*ppos represents the offset in the *file*, not the buffer, so 
cumulative is correct. So when you do your read, you need to 
interpret it thus. I've been using it in one case as a record number, 
where the records are variable length. I set *start to 1, and treat 
is as an index into a (virtual) array of records.
