Subject: 2.2.14-pre10 NFS bug: off by sizeof(int)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have two identical Pentium II machines, both running
the same image of kernel 2.2.14-pre10, freshly
compiled this morning. Both use the 3c59x ethernet driver (10-Mbit),
and are on the same ethernet switch, on the same IP subnet.
Both use knfsd and autofs, and both are dual-CPU machines running
an SMP kernel
I am using one machine (dewey) as the NFS server, and the other
machine (louie) is the NFS client. The NFS client is compiling
using source files from the NFS server, and writing the object
files back to the NFS server.
I have some kind of synchronization problem; sometimes when a
directory is made on the NFS server, the NFS client can't see it for
a few seconds.  The assembler on the NFS client fails because it
thinks the output directory does not exist.
I've been doing some network traces (I'm one of the authors of
Ethereal, BTW), and these strange "mkdir-latency" problems co-occur
with another symptom: bad NFS packets.
The following NFS packet was sent from the NFS client to the NFS
server. It's an NFS v2 LOOKUP packet. The RPC string, i.e., the
NFS filename, is misplaced. It's off by 4 bytes. (hence the subject
line of this e-mail) In my trace, the client sent over 2,000 *good*
LOOKUP packets, but at this point it sent a few *bad* ones, including
this one.
Notice at the end of the packet it looks like the filename "config.h"
was memcpy()'ed in one location, then re-memcpy()'ed
in another overlapping location.
BTW, dewey, the NFS server, correctly responds with ERR_NOENT
in it's LOOKUP reply packet. The client then sends another badly-formed
LOOKUP request, which is again replied to with "ERR_NOENT". Then
the client goes on to ask for another file, sending another badly-formed
packet.
I thought at first that there was a bug in Ethereal, but the
format of the NFS packet is indeed bad.
