I'd say so.  Please make sure that such a patch is against the very latest
Linus kernel from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots.
 
Also, the more comprehensive the patch's description the better - why it is
needed, what it does, how it works, etc.  Your 2004 description was rather
terse.
I seem to recall that the people who understand and work on this code
discussed this issue earlier this year, but I forget the conclusion.  Some
archive searching might be useful.
