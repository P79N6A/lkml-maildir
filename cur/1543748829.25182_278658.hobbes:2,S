It's not good enough, if cannot use a higher allocation priority that
GFP_NOIO here - basically guarantee that your allocation will not block
on further io. Currently you have the very same deadlock as before, the
mempool does not help you since you call into the allocator and deadlock
before ever blocking on the mempool.
