	About a year ago, I posted a patch to extend the existing
x86 lazy floating point context support to multiprocessor kernels (in
resopnse to a Alan Cox's arguing against having CONFIG_SMP on for
all kernels, because it deactivated lazy FPU support).  Shortly
thereafter, x86 lazy FPU support was removed from the kernel
entirely, with some comment about how it did not make much
different on recent x86 processors.  I have not been paying attention
lately, but, from your patches, Ben, it looks like some lazy FPU
support has returned.
	I am kind of curious: what is the latest thinking on lazy FPU
context loading for x86 these days?  Is the pendulum swinging the other
way now?  Has anyone done any benchmarks one way or the other?
