I am running 2.4-22 on x86 with Sun GigE Card. The card seemed to
recognized fined and I see it come up. However,
it doesn't want to play nice with Cisco 3500XL switch. I have tried
several port setting on the switch's port i.e.
autoneg off/on duplex full/half and etc. I see link lights, ethtool says
that the link is up, but there is no traffic coming through.
This brings me to the interesting point, apparently sungem driver was
fixed from 2.4-19 to 2.4-22, however ethtool still
has no effect on it. No matter, how much I tried to play with it, it
will not change any settings on sungem interface. It comes
at 100 Full Duplex, autoneg on. 
Has anyone able to make this card work under 2.4-22??? Please help!!
