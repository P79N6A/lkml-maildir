The system I am running 2.3.28 is an AMD K6-3/400 with a relatively
high performance SCSI subsystem, actually has a 64 PCI SCSI controller,
admittedly plugged into a 32bit slot of an x86 system.
This would eliminate the IDE problem Ted spoke of in a related email.
However you are also having the problem with a SCSI only MB. hmmmm.
I guess you are running into the evil "other" devices that Ted
mentioned.
I've noticed the CPU load related underruns a little.  I'll load up
my 2.3.28 systems CPU and see what happens, since it otherwise
works fine.
I think it would be nice if Linux had a serial subsystem that supports
115200 with a standard 16550A.  And apparently is does.  Hopefully
the "other" devices will work toward this end too.
