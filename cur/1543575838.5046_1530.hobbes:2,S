Indeed. I saw this behaviour some years ago when I was debugging a
controller that went beserk when been talked to at a 115k2 buad rate. 
My modem isn't on 115k2 now, so I don't see the problem often. I'm gonne
setup a second machine with remote kernel debugging, since I'm sick of
rebooting when I want to scan something.

Indeed. Most chips I've seen are 1 16550, or pretend to be. Probably an
issue of cost (At least, I think :))

Well.. Why is the i386 the defacto standard ? There architectures that are
a lot better. Reason it is that the some big company used it, and it got
populair.

Indeed.. Why do they save $15 bucks on a modem chipset, and replace it
with a buggy software driven solution... Making things as cheap as
possible, to make sure the're chaper then their compatitor.
