Jeff,
    The things are pretty simple (HZ - in real should be "Hz", cause HZ are
fixed for Alpha, HZ = 1024 Hz) :
        Hz = cc / calibration_time
    cc == rpcc() at end - rpcc() at begin
    calibration_time = (CLOCK_TICK_RATE / CALIBRATE_LATCH).
    So there is nothing wrong - clock ticks with CLOCK_TICK_RATE and we've a
divisor equal to CALIBRATE_LATCH. So the time interval elapses after
(CLOCK_TICK_RATE / CALIBRATE_LATCH) seconds and the CPU performs 'cc'
cycles.
    That's all. And these really works. ;-))
    About x86 style code - don't forget what LATCH defined as follows in
linux/timex.h:
#define LATCH  ((CLOCK_TICK_RATE + HZ/2) / HZ) /* For divider */
Regards,
    Oleg.
