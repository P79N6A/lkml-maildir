I'm not terribly familiar with Linux VM, and so I'm not completely sure
how to implement vmalloc_uncached on ARM. I'm wondering if I need to
re-implement all of vmalloc sub-routines (alloc_area_pmd_uncached,
alloc_area_pte_uncached) changing the set_pte call to have the
appropriate attributes ? (BTW. what's the meaning of L_PTE_BUFFERABLE ?).
or can I just alloc the area and then make pages non-cachable using
pte_modify afterwards ? In this case I'm not sure how to walk the PTEs...
Also alloc_are_pte makes several calls to __get_free_page, so I beleive
there's no way to make sure they are physically contiguous, is there ?
(note that in our case, on page should be plenty enough)
Regards,
Benjamin.
