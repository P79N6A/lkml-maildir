Spatse doesn't support that at all, and will just ignore it.
Of course, since sparse doesn't actually generate any code, there's no 
real impact from that. In theory, you might get sparse to complain if you 
do something like "__attribute__((align(sizeof(xx)))" where the size is 
now wrong and not a power-of-two, but..
