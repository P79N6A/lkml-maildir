This will give Bicoastal the ability to provide E911 services to all of the lower 48 
states via VoIP as required by the FCC. Upon successful testing of the system, Bicoastal will be in position to start offering Residential and Business VoIP 
services through its Callingpoint Communications unit within the next two weeks. 
About the Company:
Bicoastal Communications Inc. is positioned to make substantial growth in the coming years. The company strategy is to deploy into non-primary cities with 
population centers of less than one million people. Unlike the major metropolitan areas of the country, these cities have not seen the benefit of competitive product offerings. Bicoastal intends to address these deficiencies by encompassing its IP services, Traditional and VoIP Telephone services and Television (IPTV) services, securing revenues with the much-touted triple play.The strategic partnerships developed have already made it possible for Bicoastal to gain direct access to 25,000 fiber-connected homes throughout the United States.
