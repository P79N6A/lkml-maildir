I'd be willing to do it. I certainly have the time (unlike in the past).
However I'm unsure everyone would feel comfortable with me doing it
after recent experiences.
Randy, Greg KH and Greg Smith sound like good choices to me, but it is
obviously up to them to decide if they can/want to do it.

Sounds reasonable to me.
Once again, I'd be more than happy to help in any of these respects as
