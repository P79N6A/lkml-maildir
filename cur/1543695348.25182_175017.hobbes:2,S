No, I just did install 2.6 on my formerly 2.4-vanilla system!

lvm-common contains a program that decides what
iop-version/lvm-version/dm-version is running and calls the right
userland.  So you have e.g.:
/sbin/vgchange: link to lvmiopversion.  That decides to call
/lib/lvm-10/vgchange or /lib/lvm-2/vgchange depending on the kernel
stuff.  Very helpful for me.
