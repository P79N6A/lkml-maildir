From what I can gather, the question is very simple:
"Can we get our data out of BK into some kind of open format?"
It's an important question.  If the answer is "yes, but only the stuff
that can be mapped onto CVS" then that's a significant data loss, and
if BitMover changes the data format without documentation, then there
is no longer a way to get all the data out.
Presumably the CVS exporter could get augmented with some kind of
metadata export... perhaps an XML schema that describes how the
various points are to be linked or whatnot... it won't turn CVS into
BK overnight (so Larry can still sleep at night), but it would give
BitMover the freedom to change their data format.
