Netware is a fileserver for windows/dos/os2, linux is an operating
system for running applications.  Being able to serve files to other
systems is just one potential application to run on linux but it has
plenty of other things it can do.
People that need netware are people that need a fileserver for their
windows systems.  Linux is probably not what they need then.
