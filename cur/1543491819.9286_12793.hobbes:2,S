Because application XYZZY sees performance problems, and it implements
the userspace ar trick to speed things up. Then application PLUGH sees
the same problems, and it also implements the same trick, but odds are
even it's done differently. Pretty soon we have dozens of applications
all doing something similar but incompatible to get around performance
problems with hundreds of small files.
Or you could just fix the filesystem...
