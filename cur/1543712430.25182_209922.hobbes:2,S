Large or unlimited? If not unlimited you may still run into
problems when you give each process such an address space.
Limiting the number of processes is probably not an option.

You mean Address 0 is only accessible from Address space 0, but not 
from Space 1 ?
Maybe you can give each process an different address range, but AFAIK
the only people who have done this before are users of non MMU architectures.
It will probably require som changes in the portable part of the code.
Also porting glibc's ld.so to this will be likely no-fun.

Sounds like the only sane way to handle (4) would be to give the kernel
an own address space with the necessary grants to access everything.
However this will require an address space switch for every system call.
But there is no way around it, linux requires a "shared" kernel mapping
at least for part of the kernel memory ("lowmem")
Overall it sounds like your architecture is not very well suited to 
run Linux.

At least you would need to use your own drivers (I believe the IBM
iSeries and s390/VM port does it kind of). If your CPU has generic PCI
slots this will be a lot of work. Without it it will be lots of work too,
but at least the number of drivers required is limited.

It is definitely alien.
