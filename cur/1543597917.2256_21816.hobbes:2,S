Current Linux scheduler doesn't seem to be able to support this nicely.  You
can set their priorities..but the values are not very intuitive.  And if you
sleep, the result could become very inaccurate.
A new scheduler (sth like weighted round robin) is a more natural solution.
You just assign weights to processes and they will be scheduled accordingly.
