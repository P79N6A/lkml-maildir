This is likely due to the fact that some people are still living with
the misconception that all gcc-2.96 releases are buggy. They are not;
only early versions are.
gcc-2.95.[34] and gcc-2.96-(newer versions) are viable choices if you
want a working kernel. Some other versions might work, but then again,
they might not :-)

At the moment, gcc3 doesn't work too well with the kernel, and you won't
get any large benefit.

Yes.
