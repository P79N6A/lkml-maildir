Well, there're alsa packages. A lot of people use them.

Like the one in drivers/sound/adlib_card.c/opl3.c; which doesn't release
its io region when the module is removed (sent a workaround twice,
got ignored ;(  )

Those are valid points. Still I'd love to see ALSA in 2.4. I guess this is a
matter of opinion....the VM bits from Andrea are far more important (I've read
several bug reports from people who can't get big machines working ie: kswapd decides
to take all the cpu for 1 minute)
