Yes.

(Concerning the "size" version: it occurred to me that there is one
very minor objection: For extended partitions so far the size did
not normally play a role. Only the starting sector was significant.
If, at some moment we decide also to check the size, then a weaker
check, namely only checking for non-extended partitions, might be
better at first.)
(Yes, disk capacity is not always known - see e.g. ll_rw_blk.c:
 /* Test device or partition size, when known. */
See also sd.c, with the strange
                sdkp->capacity = 0x200000; /* 1 GB - random */
In such cases we just access the blocks user space tells us to access.)
