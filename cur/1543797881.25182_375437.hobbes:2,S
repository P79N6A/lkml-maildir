Subject: [ANNOUNCE][RFC] PlugSched-6.1.6 for  2.6.15-rc5 and 2.6.15-rc5-mm2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This version features a major gutting of the SPA based schedulers to 
reduce overhead.  The inclusion of the mechanisms for gathering and 
displaying accrued scheduling statistics have been made a compile time 
configurable option (default is exclusion) as they are not an integral 
part of the scheduler and were mainly there to help with tuning.  In a 
future version they will be removed completely.
Additionally, the mechanism for auto detection and preferential 
treatment of media streamers in the spa_ws scheduler has been made a 
compile time option (default is exclusion).  The reason for this is that 
my testing shows that the performance of media streamers on spa_ws is 
adequate without it.  This will also be removed in a future version 
unless requested otherwise.
A patch for 2.6.15-rc5 is available at:

Very Brief Documentation:
You can select a default scheduler at kernel build time.  If you wish to
boot with a scheduler other than the default it can be selected at boot
time by adding:
cpusched=<scheduler>
to the boot command line where <scheduler> is one of: ingosched,
nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills, spa_ws, spa_svr or zaphod.  If you
don't change the default when you build the kernel the default scheduler
will be ingosched (which is the normal scheduler).
The scheduler in force on a running system can be determined by the
contents of:
/proc/scheduler
Control parameters for the scheduler can be read/set via files in:
/sys/cpusched/<scheduler>/
