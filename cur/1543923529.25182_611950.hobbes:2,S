Subject: [PATCH 0/16] CRIS architecture: Correct compile errors

Hi,
The following patchset makes it possible to compile for the
CRIS architecture, at least when applied to the 2.6.23 kernel.
Most patches are trivial, but some are a bit more complex,
like the changes to the CRIS ethernet and serial drivers.
I've separated the changes out to logical components to ease
reviewing. Please send any comments or questions to me and
Mikael Starvik.
Crosscompiled on Debian Etch using gcc version 3.2.1 Axis release R64/1.64.
Best regards,
Jesper
