Actually "most PC systems"
Nevertheless Christoph has a point even if its hidden behind a George
Bush approach to diplomacy. The scsi core directly shouldn't need to
know about ACPI or other arch specific PM systems. 
Something like  "pci_to_acpi(struct pcidev *)" belongs in arch specific
code even if we do add a generic "void * pm_device" type pointer to
struct pci_dev or struct device for such a purpose.
