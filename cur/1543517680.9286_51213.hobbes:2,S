Excuse me? I'm saying that you can emulate link() with open(). And the
workaround being the same - cat /dev/null > file_to_delete. Look:
	a) if you have file visible to attacker - he doesn't need link(),
he can use the original reference until you remove it.
	b) if you are removing the reference, but not the contents - you
are unsafe even if attacker didn't call link() at all. He might say
exec 17<file_you_were_going_to_delete and use /dev/fd/17 afterwards.
	c) taking system single-user is slightly more drastic measure than
using cat. So even the "oh, I'll drop to single-user/reboot and his
processes will go away" doesn't cut it - it's _massive_ overkill. And if
you can do that - you have root and if there are extra links to the file
you'ld better (1) truncate it anyway, (2) spend a couple of minutes to
find other links, (3) look around in the attacker directories - he may
have more interesting things there and (4) LART the kiddie _hard_.
	Again, until you've removed your link _other_ links do not matter.
And once you've removed it it will not be used to create new ones anyway.
I still don't see anything you could buy prohibiting link().
