So far I couldn't dig it out ;-/ Yes, teco.info looks pretty much the
same. What I did find was the mentioning of ^R-mode needed for TECO info
to work. IOW, it might require ITS TECO. On the other hand, since that was
found on USENET... Hell knows. usc.edu used to have /pub/teco and there
was a lot of stuff, but it is not there now (ls-lR.gz lists it, but...)
