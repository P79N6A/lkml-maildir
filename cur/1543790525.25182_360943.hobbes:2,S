when I reboot from linux(not from windows or BIOS,they all reboot ok
from them),it will hang after the system POST before enter the grub
menu list
This only happens in reboot from linux kernel within 2.6.10-2.6.14.
I tested the older kernel version from 2.6.8 to 2.6.14,and 2.4.31 .I
found the 2.6.8 and the 2.6.9,2.4.31 worked well without above
reboot_from_linux_with_hang_after_POST,and the 2.6.10-2.6.14 all have
this.
Did this belong to the special reboot_ fixed option  in the kernel?
I send to the LKML before ,but it seemed like  none fixed it
