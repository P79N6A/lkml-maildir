The right answer to "This piece of software contains bugs" is not 
"Provide two pieces of software with the same features but different 
bugs". The only real functional difference between the two is that s2ram 
has its own internal whitelist rather than just using the hal entries. 
Suse have normally been good at making sure that they're synced across, 
but if that's not happening you probably want to poke them.
