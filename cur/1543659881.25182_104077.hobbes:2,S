the exec()-time balancing is special, since it only moves the task in
question - so the 'push' should indeed be a global decision. _But_, exec()  
is also a natural balancing point for the local node (we potentially just
got rid of a task, which might create imbalance within the node), so it
might make sense to do a 'local' balancing run as well, if the exec()-ing
task was indeed pushed to another node.

yes, this should also further unify the SMP and NUMA balancing code.
