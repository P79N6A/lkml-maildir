Somewhat better.  I still like a separate protocol handler better.
I guess I see this as being more like the ISD200 case.  In that code, it
attempts to identify the device as ATA or ATAPI.  If it's ATAPI, it
switches back to the transparent scsi protocol handler.  Here, we're just
talking about doing it on a command-by-command basis, instead of a one-time
selection.  But there is no confusion that the ISD200 code handles all
commands; but it does implement a new 'protocol' (a way to transport
commands to/from the device), which is exactly what you're doing.
