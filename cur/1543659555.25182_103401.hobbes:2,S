It seems you have been trying to correct the acpi_wakeup code (back at 17 
Dec). Has that been merged to Linus' tree?
I got 2.5.58 today, acpi_wakeup.S is still dated 16 Dec and that patch 
regarding the location of the wakeup asm code (see the '2.5.51: sleep 
broken') has not reached me through Linus' patches.
