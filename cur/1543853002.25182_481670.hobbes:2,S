Before or after freezing of the kthreads? Order _could_ be
important, and different filesystems might require different
orders. What then?

What about if there is still I/O in progress (i.e. kthread wins race and
issues async I/O after the sync but before it's frozen) - freezing the
workqueues does not prevent this activity and memory state will continue to
change as long as there is I/O completing...

Yes, in most cases.

Assuming that you actually suspended an idle filesystem, which sync does not
guarantee you.  Rather than assuming the filesystem is idle, why not guarantee
that it is idle by freezing it?
Cheers,
