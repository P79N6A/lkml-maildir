	hi all,
	just a few reports:
	1. zImage in test10 somehow isn't working properly. i have a
	zImage sized a bit more than 500kb on my harddrive which hangs at
	the loading process (the one showing dots).
	i write the image to a floppy, and it boots just fine. if i
	recompiled my kernel so the zImage size is around 490kb, the
	image gets loaded just fine.
	2. pcmcia is still missing from the test* series. it still only
	cardbus and no pcmcia. i still have to edit autoconf.h myself
	which is working just fine for me.
	3. i use ufs to mount my freebsd4 partition, following the
	instruction (including read-write support). i can read the
	partition, but i can't write. mount(8) shows that the partition
	is mounted rw. i also get:
	UFS-fs error (device 03:05):  ufs_add_entry: internal error
		fragoff xxx
	just drop me a line if you want me to test bugfix.
		imel
