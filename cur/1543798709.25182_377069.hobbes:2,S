actually, the kernel always uses real addresses, userspace uses virtual 
addresses.
This came up recently with the page tables, Linus said that he was 
absolutly opposed to adding the complication and overhead of changine the 
kernel to user virtual addresses instead of real addresses for it's data 
structures. it would add an extra level of redirection to just about every 
memory access (which also means an additional load on the cache to store 
the mapping info to resolve this redirection). The performance hit for 
this would be considerable.
