No, these aren't related to the address_space at all.  Please keep the
abstractions clean or we'll end up with a total mess.

I don't think this split makes a whole lot of sense either.  The normal
codepath needs to go through a lot of hops to make sure the odd behaviour
of falling back from direct to buffered I/O for some types of requests
works.  That needs intimate knowledge of how the direct and buffered I/O
path works.  Your XIP codepath has the luxury of not having to care for
all this, so you can keep it really simple.
