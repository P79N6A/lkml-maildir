Heh. Your previous patch removed more lines than it added, this one adds 
more lines than it removes. Snif..
I realize that it's all from that Documentation update:
 Documentation/power/freezing-of-tasks.txt |  160 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Documentation/power/kernel_threads.txt    |   40 -------
 Documentation/power/swsusp.txt            |   18 ---
so it's all good. Anyway, I'll happily do this (along with the patch to 
not do freezer at all for STR) after 2.6.22 is out, but until then I'll 
obviously be ignoring the patches flying around..
