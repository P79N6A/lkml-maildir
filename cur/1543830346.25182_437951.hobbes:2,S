Arjan,
Didn't get how stats_lock is nesting within tasklist_lock in copy_process ?
The call to cleanup_signal (or any call to taskstats_tgid_alloc/free) 
seems to be happening
outside of holding the tasklist lock ? Or maybe I'm missing something.
Changing to an irqsave variant isn't a problem of course...
