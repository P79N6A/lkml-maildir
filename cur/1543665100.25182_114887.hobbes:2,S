Subject: [PATCH] vm_area_struct slab corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Fix vm_area_struct slab corruption due to mremap's move_vma mistaking
(okay, okay, _my_ mistaking) how do_munmap splits vmas in one case.
This patch fits do_munmap to move_vma's expectation: you may well feel
that's the wrong way round to fix it (and not the way I promised a few
days ago), but at present I'm more comfortable with this simpler fix;
and it does seem preferable for do_munmap to reuse the existing vma.
