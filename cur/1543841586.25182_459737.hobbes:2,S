This question did come up already. arch_free_page() is done before the
PageReserved() check so it isn't suitable for stable/unused state
transitions. You can argue that arch_free_page() should be moved but who
knows what the architecture defined function is supposed to do?
page_set_stable/page_set_unused on the other hand have a clearly defined
meaning.
