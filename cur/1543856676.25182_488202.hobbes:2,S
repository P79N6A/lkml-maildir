I don't think that assumption is correct. If you have no load on your 
system and the pages in the shared application cache are not actually 
touched, it is perfectly reasonable for the kernel to push out these 
unused pages to swap space to have even more RAM available (e.g. for 
caching the pages more recently accessed by the tar and patch commands). 
I believe your OOM problem is not connected to these observations. There 
might be a problem in the handling of OOM situations in Linux. But before 
coming to that conclusion, I would suggest trying your simulated software 
upgrade scenario with plenty of swap space available and without playing
any tricks with MM settings.
