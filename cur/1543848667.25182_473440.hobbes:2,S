Subject: [PATCH] libata-sff: Allow for wacky systems

There are some Linux supported platforms that simply cannot hit the low
I/O addresses used by ATA legacy mode PCI mappings. These platforms have
a window for PCI space that is fixed by the board logic and doesn't
include the neccessary locations.
Provide a config option so that such platforms faced with a controller
that they cannot support simply error it and punt
