Amen to that, Frank.  Driving off talented contributers is a Very Bad 
Thing for Linux in the long run.  This will not not stop evolutionary 
progress, but it slows it down and may result in an overly inbred 
animal.
It is especially easy to drive off a contributor whose day job is not 
Linux hacking.

Daniel
