An address from the user space. For example the 2nd argument of
a read() [both the user space system call and a character device
read]. Not sure about the vmalloc() aspect. 
Just to save you a little time, you may be needing the
recently added page_address() macro as well to get a 32 bit
address back out of a page object suitable for a DMA chip.
