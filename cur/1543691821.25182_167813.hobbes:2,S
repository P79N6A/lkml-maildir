Hi All,
A semiconductor company in the New York area is looking for 3 to 4 Operating
Systems Developers.
Please see below for a brief on the company and job description.
*************
 
The company is a fabless semiconductor company that develops and markets
revolutionary fully programmable software-defined-radio (SDR) chipsets for
multimode, multi-function wireless handheld devices. They provide their
customers tremendous competitive value in the global cellular marketplace
through an exceptionally cost effective, ultra-low power broadband wireless
technology based on a new DSP baseband architecture. 
 
Offering a complete software-defined radio system for WCDMA, GSM and EGPRS,
the new product is an ultra-low power, multi-threaded processor that has
been designed to execute Java, Digital Signal Processing (DSP), and
RISC-style control code in a unified architecture. The SoC will also allow
handset capabilities to be enhanced through the introduction of new
protocols, applications and functions by means of over-the-air dynamic
software downloads.  
The multimode multi-function baseband processor is powered by the company's
0.13-micron DSP, which integrates an ARM microcontroller with 16MB of
on-chip Memory and a multi-mode protocol stack. The DSP can deliver 9600
million MAC operations per second. The platform offers support for MP3,
MPEG4, JEPG, JPEG2000, WMA, AAC, Bluetooth and 802.11b. In addition,
peripheral support is on tap for SIM, USIM, IrDA, FastIRDA, GPIO, UART, USB,
Compact Flash, MMC, DS Memory, Memory Stick and Smart Memory
