Basically, kernel have to wait of completion of I/O.

I didn't consider deeply about this, because usually
enterprise server doesn't need Video capture feature or AGP.
It is usually controlled from other machine.
If it is really necessary, kernel might have to wait 
I/O completion or driver modification is necessary.

I can use page remmaping method by Iwamoto-san.
(See: 
http://people.valinux.co.jp/~iwamoto/mh.html#remap
)
I guess that many case can be saved by this.

In sendfile case, kernel will wait too. Sooner or later, it will be
timeout.
Thank you for your comment.
