last time I pointed to such 'misguided' apps which 
made assumptions that are not necessarily true
inside a virtual environment (e.g. pstree, initpid)
the general? position was that those apps should
be fixed instead adding a 'workaround'
note: personally I'm absolutely not against virtualizing
the device names so that each guest can have a separate
name space for devices, but there should be a way to
'see' _and_ 'identify' the interfaces from outside
(i.e. host or spectator context)
best,
Herbert
