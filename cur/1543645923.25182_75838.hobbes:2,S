  I'm not sure what the kernel issue is, but there is a simple work 
around.  Enable CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD (aka boot off-board chipsets 
first) in the ide section.  You can also produce the same effect via 
ide=reverse on the kernel command line (or an append statement in lilo). 
 This will reverse the order in which the chipsets are seen.
