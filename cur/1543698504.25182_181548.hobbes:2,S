I also thought i should make mention of the slow and lost interrupts when 
copying from hdf->hdg, and not using DMA, and the fact that i have to set 
up a do loop in bash with ntpdate to keep the clock going. losing 6-12 
seconds every 15 seconds. (HZ=1000 and jif64 patch by Tim Schleimau 
applied, ported to -ac & -pac by me)
Mouse is sluggish as well.
Sorry for the very grotty grammar. -ENOCAFFEINE

They went rushing down that freeway,
Messed around and got lost.
They didn't care... they were just dying to get off,
And it was life in the fast lane.
