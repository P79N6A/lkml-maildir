kdep.h:
 - mraid_scsi_host_alloc/mraid_scsi_host_dealloc should go away, just
   define scsi_host_alloc/scsi_host_put wrappers for 2.4.
 - mraid_scsi_set_pdev should go away, it's not needed in 2.6 at all
   because scsi_add_host does all the work and for 2.4 just use
   scsi_set_pci_device directly.
 - all the SCP2FOO defines should go away, the 2.6 variants work for 2.4
   aswell
 - mraid_set_host_lock should go, just use scsi_assign_lock and define
   it for 2.4.
megaraid_clib.c:
  - why do you need the scb pool managment code at all?  You can dynamically
    allocate scbs in ->queuecommand
  - can you explain the need for all the mraid_pci_blk_pool?  I.e. why the
    generic dma pool routines don't work for megaraid
all files:
  - please avoid using scsi.h and hosts.h from drivers/scsi in favour of
    the include/scsi/ headers, especially get rid of all the Scsi_Foo
    typedefs
