Possibly because the framebuffer might want some kind of optimised version
that doesn't have the same semantics. However I expect this should be done
directly in the appropriate bmove() anyway.
As far as a fast_memmove() for Alpha goes, you said you were using a hacked
memcpy and this is probably what we should do (and maybe install it as the
global one) unless someone else wants to write a real one.
