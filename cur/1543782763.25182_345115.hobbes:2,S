Ok.

No idea - I've given up tracking what compilers work and don't work on
the grounds that I'm too scared to change my compiler!  gcc 3.3 works
fine here which is the only version I use (until it's proven far too
buggy through local experience).
That probably means we should say "at least GCC 3.3" though I'm not
sure if that's entirely accurate.
Toolchains are just pure evil as far as stability on ARM goes.
