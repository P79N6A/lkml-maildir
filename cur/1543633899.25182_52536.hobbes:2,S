Great, this was really missing badly.
But how about adding another column: GUID.
Most usb-storage and (all?) FireWire devices have such a unique identitiy.
In contrast to native SCSI devices, these emulated SCSI devices on 
hot-plugging busses will change their LUNs/IDs. Therefor the GUID is really 
a must to be able to create stable names (laptop suspend, etc.).
Both usb-storage and iee1394-sbp2 know the GUID. It only needs to be 
communicated..
I'd guess that FibreChannel has similar problems ?
