as i mentioned before, SystemTap should be in tree. Relayfs was added 
for the sake of SystemTap for example, i have no problem with moving 
SystemTap into the tree either.

You can write embedded-C SystemTap scripts too. There's an "EMBEDDED C" 
section in "man stap".

i very much agree that they should become as fast as possible. So to 
rephrase the question: can we make dynamic tracepoints as fast (or 
nearly as fast) as static tracepoints? If yes, should we care about 
static tracers at all?

no. I'm saying that dynamic tracers are fundamentally more advanced, and 
that _iff_ we are to add static info to the kernel we should add it _for 
the sole sake of speeding up dynamic tracers_. If static tracers can 
live off the same hooks then fine, but we should architect primarily for 
the needs of the dynamic tracers.

ok. For me 'static tracepoints' are like the sort of stuff that LTT 
adds: funky function names littering the tree.
i see the point behind 'data extraction point' hooks mentioned by you as 
a compromise, which incidentally will also speed up dynamic tracepoints 
to the level of static tracepoints. But they should be very much 
constructed as data extraction points for the purposes of dynamic 
tracers. (which the LTT hooks currently are not)

for a dynamic tracer all that is needed is a 5-byte NOP (even on 
64-bit), and the availability of all the data. Maybe even a function 
call that can be patched out after bootup, with NOPs. But the current 
LTT stuff has lots of inlined crap that just bloats the kernel.

So you dont care about recompiling: that's fine - but others care, so as 
long as all your needs are met (which we are working on meeting :-) then 
we'll go for the solution that is better - instead of having some dual 
debugging infrastructure.

no - at least for me it's the Big Kernel Semaphore ;-)
