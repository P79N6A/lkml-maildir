No, actually "#error" is a C pre-processor directive to cause the
compiler to generate an error at that spot (#warning generates a
compiler warning).
This was obviously put there by someone because this driver needs to be
updated to match a change in an API in the 2.5 kernel.  Making it a
comment means that either you will get a compile error anyways, but
without the useful pointer as to how it can be fixed, or worse - no
compile error but problems (including data corruption) later on.
I would do as the message states, and read DMA-mapping.txt to fix this.
Quite often kernel developers do not have access to all of the hardware
supported by Linux, so it is up to people like yourself who _do_ have
this hardware to fix it and test it - it is in your own best interest
to do so.
Cheers, Andreas
