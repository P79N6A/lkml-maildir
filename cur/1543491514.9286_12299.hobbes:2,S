Nope. Solid freezes during use. Might take 15 minutes. Might take 15 hours.
But I was going down once or twice a day almost everyday since I started using
2.2. I recompiled with MTRR's turned off: Not a lock since the 25th.
FYI the second thing in my list to disable was the framebuffer.
Someone mentioned framebuffer + X as causing him locks.

Not that I remember seeing, but I'm not sure.
