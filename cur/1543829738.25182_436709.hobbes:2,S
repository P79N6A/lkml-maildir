I think this is definitely going in the right direction.
A few comments.
 - The test for IS_ROOT surprises me.  I thought anonymous dentries
   were all IS_ROOT.   Maybe this changes with your shared-superblock
   changes? 
 - You have two nested loops implemented with gotos.  Dijykstra would
   be shocked!  The logic looks like it should be:
     for(;;) {
        while (!list_empty(&dentry->d_subdirs)) {
		stuff-1;
		dentry = list_entry(dentry->d_subdirs.next,....)
	}
	while (list_empty(dentry->d_subdirs)) {
		parent = dentry->d_parent (or NULL)
		d_free(dentry)
		if (!parent) return;
		dentry = parent;
	}
     }
    Which I think makes it a lot more readable (obviously I have left
    out lots of the details in the above.
  - The section that I have called 'stuff-1' above seems excessive.
    Everytime you visit a dentry with children, you remove them from
    the unused list (if present) and d_drop them from the hash.  After
    the first time, these should all be no-ops.  If there some
    particular reason for this that I'm not seeing (which case I'd
    like a comment) or can you just unuse/drop the dentry just before
    freeing it
  - Think the reference counting deserves a comment.  I think that
    this routine holds a reference count on 'dentry' and every parent
    up to the IS_ROOT.  Is that right?
In summary, it looks right, though I feel I would want to go through
and double check the refcounting again, but I would rather do that
with it restructured into while loops.
Is that fair?
