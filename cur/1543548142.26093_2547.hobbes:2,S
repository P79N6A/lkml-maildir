Harken back to David Miller, who wrote about occupying his hands
with something to keep them the hell off the keyboard while he is
meditating on a screen full of code.
One of my debugging tools is a printer.  I print out bunches of
source code and trace files and then I go to a room *without* any
computers in it and I read for a while.
And I still write a lot of source code with pen and paper.
