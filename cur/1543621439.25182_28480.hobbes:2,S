Personally, I like this less.. I don't think the previous #define 
DMA_ADDR_T_FMT (or whatever it was) is that bad, considering the options.
Once we set the precedent of having little 'char 
* form_some_random_type()' functions, they will show up all over the 
place.
I need something like this for the MTD patch I've got that supports 64 
bit buswidths on 32 bit machines and needs to printk the data on error.
I found that #define CFI_FMT '%lx' or whatever to be more 
straightforward, and easier to understand.
