FWIW, I have the IDE version of that drive (or similar) I think its the
DVD-304 or something. And SELECT_SPEED does not work on it. It works fine
on the CDROM players I have, but not that one. It might be related to the
SCSI version, maybe the drive itself ignores it ?
I wanted to set the drive to the slowest speed so it does not sound like a
Harrier Jumpjet when I play MP3's. But no luck..
