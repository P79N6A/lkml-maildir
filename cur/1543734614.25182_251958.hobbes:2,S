But that's mm->page_table_lock, for which pagevecs aren't used, and for
faulting there isn't a batch of work to do anyway, so other methods are
needed, e.g. more finegrained pte locking or lockless pagetable radix
trees. I'd favor going fully lockless, but haven't put any code down
for it myself.

truncate is rare enough I didn't bother but that probably hurts it the
worst. I'd expect pte teardown to affect mostly anonymous pages, as
file-backed pages will have a reference from the mapping holding them
until either that's shot down or they're evicted via page replacement.

mlock() is the case I have in hand, though I've only heard of it being
problematic on vendor kernels. MAP_POPULATE is underutilized in
userspace thus far, so I've not heard anything about it good or bad.

It only really applies when either the lock transfer time is high, such
as it is in NUMA architectures with high remote access latencies to
sufficiently distant nodes, or the arrival rates are high, such as they
are in unusual workloads, as the common cases (and even some of the
unusual ones) have already been addressed. Marcelo's original bits
about cache alignment are likely more pressing; my real hope was to get
some guess at the pagevec size based on NR_CPUS, align it upward to a
cacheline boundary, and subtract the size of the header information,
but as I found there are diminishing returns, and there are cache size
boundaries to be concerned about, I'd favor advancing marcelo's cache
alignment work prior to exploring larger batches' benefits.
