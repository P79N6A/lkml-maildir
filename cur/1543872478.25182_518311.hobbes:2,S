It's all very odd Matt. It really isn't behaving anything like you describe 
for myself or others. It sounds more like a real bug than what the design 
would do at all. The only things that are different on yours is Beryl and a 
different graphics card. When you're comparing to mainline are you 
comparing -mm1 to -mm2 to ensure something else from -mm isn't responsible? 
Also have you tried rsdl on 2.6.20 as Willy suggested? I would really love to 
get to the bottom of this as it really shouldn't behave that way under load 
no matter how the load is dished out.
Thanks!
