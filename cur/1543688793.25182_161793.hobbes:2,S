If you are running binaries for another architecture via software
emulation (for example qemu running x86 binaries on your S/390 
transparently) then you want exec only binaries to work with an
otherwise trusted interpreter [Getting the interpreter trust stuff
right is really hard btw - so ironically it probably has to be setuid
anyway so you can't steal the handle]
