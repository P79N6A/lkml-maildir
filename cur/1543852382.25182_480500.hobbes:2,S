After reading this thread, I have to say that this seems preferable to
relying on new-ish binutils.  Someday in the future we can fix it up
but I think too many people are still using old gas versions now.
You can hide the .byte crap in one place with #defines I think, so
it's not so bad.  We already do this for a few things in asm-i386 and
asm-x86_64 anyway.
