I don't understand. flush_tlb_page() done in the context of a thread won't care
about the state of the physical page. I don't see how it's related to kiobufs.

We never talked about this issue in the previous emails. That is required
regardless of how we solve the MM corruption.

IMHO pinning the page in the pte is less expensive and less complex than making
rawio and the VM aware of those issues. (remap_page_range is so clean
implementation exactly because it pins the page into the pte)
