Yup. For 4 archs IIRC.

ACK. It boils down to have n (i.e. lots of) cross-compilers installed.
Compiling needs n times as much time - you compile once for every
architecture. The binaries get much larger. You have to store and
transport them at startup (OK, this is pretty pathetic.) And then the
shared loader/kernel throws n-1 versions away.
On NeXT folks started to disable the FAT binaries just because of these
reasons.

And on Linux too. OO.org is on the major distros only as 32bit available
and runs "natively" on x86_64.
Actually the example is not that good.

ACK. With apt-get/yum/portage/... most of the problems which were solved
with fat binaries a decade ago are already solved.
