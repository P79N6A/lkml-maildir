Well, it has become apparent that I have neither the skills nor the time
to do anything about this.  I have come up with the following patch, which
seems, at least, to reduce the frequency of the crashes -- but I'm not 
totally sure if that's really the case, or if it's just my wishful thinking.
I have included it on the off chance that it might be helpful, in some way,
in coming up with a better solution.
Anyways, the card is a PAS16D.
I will be unsubscribing from the list shortly due to lack of time, but
if anyone comes up with a potential solution to this, I will be happy
to test it if someone sends it my way.
BTW, does anyone know if the MVP3 chipset is affected by this problem?
Does it appear when using PCI sound cards?
