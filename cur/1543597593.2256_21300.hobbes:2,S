Sleep like this is useless in real code. You either want your ioctl to unblock
when event (or time-out) happens or use sleep function to make driver wait certain 
amount of time (if you need to access poorly-designed hardware).

Well, give 'em at least some credit for copycating :-)
As a system architect I would say a *good* copycating.
For example:
Win32 events (CreateEvent(), WaitForxxxObject()) are very useful things.
The whole reason I was asking my questions is because I want to emulate Win32-like
event mechanism it Linux driver. I wouldn't mind to have this mechanism built into
Linux kernel. 
Say, one of the user process threads calls:
ret = WaitForSingleObject(hObject, dwTimeoutms);
or
ret = WaitForMultipleObjects(nNumber, hObjects[], FALSE, dwTimeoutms);
and waits until time-out or one (or more) objects are set.
From the driver side you call:
KeSetEvent(hNotifyEvent, (KPRIORITY)1, FALSE);
when you want to release object.
It's very useful.
For example, with our hardware I can have up to 16*4 = 64 totally separated 
subsystems. Each subsystem can fire event asynchronously. It's much easier to
control each subsystem in separate thread and Win32 events are very handy.
