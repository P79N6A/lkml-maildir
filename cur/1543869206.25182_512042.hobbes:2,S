I've experienced just such a hardware fault.
The Infineon DSCC4 serial controller has a hardware bug
in the PCI request/grant handling that can lead to the
device driving the PCI bus in conflict with another device.
While the results were random (as the oops in this problem
seem to be), the trigger was always activating certain
devices in combination.
In your case, altering the timing/behavior of the serial
device during open may be provoking the hardware fault.
