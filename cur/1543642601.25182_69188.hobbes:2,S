We should be safe from that since ->end() is called after the handler at 
at that stage the irq line is still disabled due to us not ack'ing in 
->ack()

After looking at the code at bit more the following would still work for 
level triggered via ioapic. Due to that specific irq line being 
effectively disabled until we hit ->end.
desc->handler->ack();
action->handler()
while(work_to_do) {
	ack_interrupt_on_card();	<-- unmask_irq_line in here too
	do_isr_work();
}
...
desc->handler->end();
So it looks like your previous suggestion of driver modification still 
stands, would it be safe then to do a real ack in the isr (for the ioapic 
case)?
