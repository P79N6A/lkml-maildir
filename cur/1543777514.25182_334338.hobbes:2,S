  I don't know much about VM, but, if that's necessary, I think that 
limiting pagecache size per mounted fs (or by some other applicable 
category) is easier/more complete approach.  After all, you cannot mmap 
w/ O_DIRECT and many programs (gcc, ld come to mind) mmap large part of 
their memory usage.
  Thanks.
