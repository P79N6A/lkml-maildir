That's right. And I didn't say, that _this is a good thing_. The
question was (and is IMHO), "do we put such code into a "hall of driver
writer shame" or do we either just reject the code from the kernel tree
or do we help "the poor misunderstood vendor" to convert.
Simply flaming them down will definitely not help. As someone with your
experience should know, too.

You're welcome.
I'm willing to give you a bet: You put up such a "hall of shame" and we
will see what comes first:
a) media echo that "linux core developers start insulting code
committers"
or
b) vendors start cleaning up their code.
