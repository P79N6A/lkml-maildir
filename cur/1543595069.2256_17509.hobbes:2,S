I thought this was what the LGPL was for?
Unfortunately, it wouldn't be easy to switch from GPL to LGPL for the LInux 
kernel precisely BECAUSE Linus is not the sole copyright holder.
(Note: Richard Stallman insisted anyone who contributed a patch of any size 
to GNU sign a piece of paper handing their copyright over to the FSF.  
Unfortunately, this created so much friction around getting patches in that 
it was a significant factor to GNU stalling and forking to produce Linux.)
