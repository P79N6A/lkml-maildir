See this myself.  SCMIIW (Someone Correct Me If I'm Wrong <g>), but the
kernel has a 15 minute timeout.  What happens is the masq box just drops
the masq entry and causes the connection to be dropped as well.
run ipchains -M -L
that will show you what connections are masq'd and will also tell you when
they will expire (if no more data is sent over the connection).
IMHO, this is better than the way some m$ proxy server does it...  I used
rtelnet to connect from work to home, after about 10 minutes, if I didn't
send anything out, it would drop the connection (Doesn't matter if tail or
whatnot is running)
