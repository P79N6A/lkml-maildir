Heh, no, code is our currency here, it's the center of everything that
we do and work with.  Agreements, deadlines and plans are just not
relevant at all here, sorry.
So again, post the code, in reviewable patches, and then let's talk.  A
number of developers have expressed a concrete interest in getting this
kind of feature into the kernel tree, so show us the code so that we can
move forward.
thanks,
