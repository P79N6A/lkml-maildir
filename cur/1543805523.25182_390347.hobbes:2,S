The fact that sched_yield came originally from the realtime extensions 
is just a historical artifact. There was a pthread_yield() function 
specifically for threads and it was merged with sched_yield(). Today 
sched_yield() is a core part of the basic Threads specification, 
independent of the realtime extensions. The fact that it is defined 
solely in the language of the realtime priorities is an obvious flaw in 
the spec, since the function itself exists independently of realtime 
priorities. The objection I raised with the Open Group specifically 
addresses this flaw.

It appears that you just read the spec and blindly followed it without 
thinking about what it really said and failed to say. The best 
interpretation would come from saying "hey, this spec is only defined 
for realtime behavior, WTF is it supposed to do for the default 
non-realtime case?" and getting a clear definition in the spec.
