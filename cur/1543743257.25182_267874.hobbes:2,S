No, this is a damn annoying kbuild problem when cross compiling.  It's
just nice that the UML folks run into this too and found a better fix
than deleting the /boot and /lib files from the list.

I have a feeling that changing the behavior of 'make {,x,g,q}config' to
fail if there's no .config will upset a lot of users, possibly even more
than would be upset by never looking in /boot or /lib ever.
