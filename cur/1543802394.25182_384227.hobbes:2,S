I won't try to speak for Linus (perhaps he'd like to pipe up at some point), 
but I think you're pulling that concept wayy out of context here.
Quoting ManagementStyle:

Built into that paragraph, I think, is the assumption that you never 'do 
both'. 
Also, referring to OSS/Alsa is just a great way to illustrate the problem with 
your idea. There is, today, finally a "dominant" solution, but how long did 
it take us to get there? By my count, a really long time! And along the way 
we've had to deal with all kinds of applications that just support the first 
and not the other. And it seems like far too many people still have just one 
foot in the door - take for instance the README files shipped with commercial 
game ports that advise using OSS at the first hint of trouble with Alsa.
Is this what we want for wireless?
