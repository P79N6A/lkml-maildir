Yes. There is already some code in base that does this. For NUMAQ specifically
this check happens and clustered mode is selected for APIC. My patch has this 
additinal check (after the initial IBM OEM check), for non-NUMAQ systems with 
more than 8 CPUs and xAPIC support. These systems can not work with the 
default flat addressing mode. So, this patch sets up such systems in physical 
mode.
