So you intend to make so many changes to the kernel that a
previously thought-out exploit may no longer be workable?
A preemptive strike, so to speak? No thanks, to quote Frank
Lanza of L3 communications; "Better is the enemy of good enough."

It makes sense to add incremental improvements to security as
part of the normal maturation of a product. It does not make
sense to dump a new pile of snakes in the front yard because
that might keep the burglars away.

Adding protections for which no known threat exists is a waste of
time, effort, and adds to the kernel size. If you connect a machine
to a network, it can always get hit with so many broadcast packets
that it has little available CPU time to do useful work. Do we
add a network throttle to avoid this? If so, then you will hurt
somebody's performance on a quiet network. Everything done in
the name of "security" has its cost. The cost is almost always
much more than advertised or anticipated.

This isn't relevant at all. The Navy doesn't have any secure
systems connected to a network to which any hackers could connect.
The TDRS communications satellites provide secure channels
that are disassembled on-board. Some ATM-slot, after decryption
is fed to a LAN so the sailors can have an Internet connection
for their lap-tops. The data took the same paths, but it's
completely independent and can't get mixed up no matter how
hard a hacker tries.
