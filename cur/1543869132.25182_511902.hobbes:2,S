I don't know about the Hitachi's, but the Maxtor with that firmware is
definitely broken. It _appeared_ to work if the depth was limited to 4,
but I didn't test it long enough to be absolutely certain. So the safest
is indeed to blacklist it.
I'm pretty sure my initial NCQ patches had a blacklist entry for that
drive as well, but apparently the blacklist got lost somewhere along the
way?
