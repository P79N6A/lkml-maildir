Subject: 2.6.10-bk3 seems to break CIFS

When compiling a 2.6.10-bk3 based kernel (with some more patches, none
of them touching CIFS or ipv6 AFAIK), CIFS fails to build due to some
ipv6 error, although I haven't got IPv6 selected in my configuration.
Error message:

-D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude  -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs

make[2]: *** [fs/cifs/connect.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs/cifs] Error 2
make: *** [fs] Error 2
Using GCC 3.4.3, Gentoo system.
When looking at the -bk3 diff [1] the pinet6 field seems to be removed.
I did not try to revert this patch and compile it, will try later.
