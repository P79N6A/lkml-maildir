Hi,
   I have the following problem when compiling linux kernel on Intel 
Pentium4M machine:
drivers/acpi/osl.c:57:38: empty filename in #include
drivers/acpi/osl.c: In function `acpi_os_table_override':
drivers/acpi/osl.c:258: error: `AmlCode' undeclared (first use in 
this function)
drivers/acpi/osl.c:258: error: (Each undeclared identifier is 
reported only once
drivers/acpi/osl.c:258: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [drivers/acpi/osl.o] Error 1
   It turned out I have enabled the custom DSDT option but the field 
for the custom file have left empty. That's the cause for the error.
Something should probably take care of this case. I use "menuconfig"
to manipulate the .config file.
M.
