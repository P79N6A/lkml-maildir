Where is the problem? This asks for a permission, not for exclusive rights.

That's a problem for Linux, not for Larry.
If you send a patch to Linus this means you distribute a modification to 
GPLed source, which means it's automatically placed under the GPL.
What's missing is a comment in the BK-usage document that informs the 
submitter that he must give the permission to republish the commit info. 
i.e. asking Linus to pull from an url is not a private message to Linus, 
it's the equivalent of sending a mail to a public, moderated mailing list.
