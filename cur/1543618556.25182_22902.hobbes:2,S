I can second that.
You know that this thread was running for some time ([patch] amd athlon 
cooling on kt266/266a chipset).
Find below the best numbers I've ever seen (I resend them, here):
Athlon TB 1.2 GHz on MSI MS-6380 (KT7-Turbo-R):
idle mode with full VCool stuff under Win98SE
(you could watch the temperature drop in 5 sec (?) steps...;-)
~64°C => 29°-30°C
Case was somewhat below after that.
