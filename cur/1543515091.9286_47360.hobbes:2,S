I see.  I expect parport_pc is guilty then of that..

At least 'parport' should, or else you'd get unresolved symbols.  It's
true that parport_pc won't necessarily get pulled in though.
Due to the parport_register_driver mechanism, parport_enumerate (to step
through the list of ports) isn't really required any more.  I've left it
in for compatibility, and also left the parport_lowlevel business in for
now.
The idea is that /etc/modules.conf has a post-install for parport to pull
in the low-level driver.  This should be in Documentation/parport.txt if
it isn't already.

In what way does it fail?
