You binary-module-compatibility people keep pointing at other operating
systems as how all this can and should be achieved.  OK, question: How
does NT solve the problem of keeping compatibility in the face of
different optimizations for different CPUs?  Answer: single UP kernel
and single SMP kernel for *all* x86 CPUs.  (Wait, do they even
*support* 386?  Not sure.)  And no inlining of fastpath code like
spinlocks.  Is this what we want?
