I've a 2.2.7 kernel, used for multiple systems, and its working fine -
except for an IBM PS/2 9595 (MCA) all SCSI box.
On the 9595 box (with the newest MCA scsi drivers 3.1e), SCSI only
(IBM Fast SCSI-2 Adapter), I'm getting errors that the MCA SCSI
code can't obtain IRQ 14...  Bummer, I need IDE devices for some
of the other boxen ;-{ 
I read ide.txt and then used the following in lilo.conf (on one line):
append="mca-pentium,ibmmcascsi=display,0x3540,7,
        hda=none,hdb=none,hdc=none,hdd=none,ide0=noprobe,ide1=noprobe"
However, I still see the errors from hd{a,b} and ide0!
Have I missunderstood ide.txt?
