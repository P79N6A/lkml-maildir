That is much harder to do. The nfs server would have to take over the
permissions checking on behalf of whatever it is exporting for all
operations.

The lack of agreement on root squashing is a reason for it to be a
matter of administrator-defined policy, and why the solution chosen
_should_ allow for that kind of behaviour.
If the user is free to futz around with the namespace, then it makes a
lot of sense for administrators to want to restrict access to this
user-defined namespace to non-suid programs that won't start screwing
round with opening files on arbitrary filesystems using the wrong
credentials and/or capabilities.
Particularly so if the user is capable of mounting remote filesystems.
