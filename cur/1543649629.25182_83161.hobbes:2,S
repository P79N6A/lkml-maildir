Presumably epoll_add could be enhanced to let user specify a user data
word.

You might want to use aio_write() for writes, and read() for reads,
in which case you could tell epoll you're not interested in
write readiness events.  Then there'd be no double notification
for reads or writes on same fd.
It's a bit contrived, but I can imagine it being useful.
