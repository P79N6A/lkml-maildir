No kidding.
Taking a look at the web site it does look pretty impressive.  And it is
using other code that was integrated recently (linux virtual server), as
well as lustre, opengfs, etc.  This looks like they're making a lot of
progress, and doing it in a generic way.
I hope the code is as good as their documentation, and marketing...
