What is insane is using sysfs in ways it was not designed to do so.  The
color map is clearly not a "single, small value".  I have recommended
that the binary file in sysfs be used instead, as that is a designed
solution, but the authors do not want to do so for some odd reason.
So, we have a number of proposed solutions:
	- custom fs
	- binary sysfs file
	- configfs
and yet, people still complain...
bleah.
