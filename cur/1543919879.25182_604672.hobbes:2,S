Aha. That makes sense.
But on the second error, where the drive was kicked out completely all
three traces did not have ata_scsi_flush_xlat.

So the commands that generate the WARNINGs seem only later collateral damage.

But I very much agree about this. But rather than 'normal' edges with
the cache flushes, I would blame it on the SMART commands from smartd
that trigger the switch.
Both errors happend during the startup of smartd.

Looking more at this patch, I thing the code change is correct and
only the comment is missing sata_nv. (Only ahci, sil24 and nv seem to
use NCQ und so need the logic from qc_defer)

That commit (3cb664c2d319a4fde5028c3c5dab6221fe70bd2d) seems to be the
only commit relevant to swncq, as it adds it completely without any
partial steps that could be bisected.

I will try this. Currently I have sata_nv.swncq=1 in my kernel
commandline so its trivial to change that.
But as only 2 out of 3 boots failed, I think I hit another heisenbug.
> My gut feeling is that there is a lingering bug in sata_nv SWNCQ somewhere.
Older versions of SWNCQ already worked for me, so I don't think its a
general problem.
And as the symptoms would nicely fit into a race condition when
manipulating the NCQ state, the removal of the lock protecting the
private sata_nv defer_queue between 2.6.23-rc8-mm1 and 2.6.23-mm1
looks like the prime suspect.
So now booting with and without swncq and if swncq=0 works, I will try
to add the lock back...
