Hint: You are trying to load a module without a GPL compatible license
       and it has unresolved symbols.  The module may be trying to access
       GPLONLY symbols but the problem is more likely to be a coding or
       user error.  Contact the module supplier for assistance, only they
       can help you.

Read from remote host testhpt: Operation timed out
Connection to testhpt closed.
Any ideas?
If I load the kernel's driver for the HPT3xxx card, it loads, but then it
does not see any drives.
The card and driver(s) included with RedHat 7.3 worked perfectly, but it
seems that any other distribution (current) has serious problem.
Can anyone suggest what is going wrong?
Must it be booted ONLY with an initrd to properly setup the drives, or?
What is the problem with this card?
