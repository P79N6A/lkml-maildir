Alan if we call anything the shutdown methods really are the thing
to call.  Because they are exactly the specialty recovery functions for
problematic devices.
Of course no matter what we do will this work 100% of the time because
part of what we will be fighting is broken hardware.  However we should
be able to get a mechanism that works most of the time.
What is your concern with stopping DMA?
- Not smashing the recovery routine.
- Getting a corrupted core dump because of on-going DMA?
