Again SCSI has no command_parser or filter either.
Thus I can issue command fragments that fry the data........completely.
This will be published soon........
This can take down all SCSI servers.
Now a command parser will prevent this from happening.
The block-layer has problems of a magnitude that I have not exploited yet.
There may be a SCSI "command_parser" or "filter" in the works.
Note that both the patch and the exploit tool get published togather.
Good'day
