Ok, but why else would you want your own makefiles if that's not that you 
wanted them for?

True, but in this case you are voicing concern about the potential breakage
of something which was always known to be bad practice, fragile and
unreliable.
Your expression of concern is noted, but with about as much sympathy as is 
granted to those who express concern because kernel headers which they were 
including from userspace have changed.
Yes, it breaks if you invent you own makefiles. We knew that. 
Don't Do That Then -- or if you must, then just deal with it breaking in 
the kernel-de-jour.

'make -C $LINUXDIR SUBDIRS=$PWD modules' has worked for as long as I can
remember; it's not new in 2.5. It's _always_ been the only reliable way to 
get kernel modules to build with the correct options.
