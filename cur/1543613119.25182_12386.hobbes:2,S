Yeah, I know - I've read it.  What I was trying to say with "post a
patch or request any specific changes" is that we can make proposals
till the cows come home, but someone has to do the work and it seems
noone has implemented these things in the intervening year.
The encoding should cater for these future changes, for sure - through
a version or features field, or an ACL "family" concept, or whatever
(these things shouldn't pollute the generic EA interfaces though).
If the current POSIX ACL format isn't good enough for the needs that
you've foreseen, then it would be a good idea to suggest your changes
to Andreas directly.
Yes, it would help if the current format was documented. ;)  But the
code is there and the format it implements hasn't changed at all in
the year that's gone.

These are valid points - I have only read Andreas' code and I
don't believe the format he has chosen is documented anywhere.
It really should be and (imo) all system attributes should be
documented and incorporated into the extended attributes docs.
cheers.
