The spin_lock is used only to protect write_urb_busy. An atomic_t seem
to be more appropriate for it. If we do that, I guess we can remove the
(then unused) spinlock.
So we have three proposed changes:
- Add semaphore to serialize close()/open() (properly documented)
- Replace write_urb_busy with an atomic_t
- Remove the spinlock

I agree.
