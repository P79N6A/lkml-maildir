Believe it, I inadvertently mangled one disk completely when I forgot 
and tried nvidia 5336 with 2.6.5-mm1 after I'd had success with 
2.6.5-clo1 and had another one not completing boot up before I knew of 
the problem. It would be nice if Andrew made it a config option until 
NVidia fixes the problem. There is a patch to change back from 4KSTACKS 
in the list recently. The last time, I changed it in .config then did a 
make oldconfig which changed it back and BOOM!
Regards
Sid.

        And I have yet to have a single problem. In fact, everything is
        working swimmingly!
    Are you sure you are using nvidia's binary driver?
    $ dmesg | grep nvidia
    $ grep -i nvidia /var/log/XF*

    PS: I'm recompiling my kernel with 4KSTACKS, but I doubt it will work.
