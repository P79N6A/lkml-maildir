I notice that when one closes a pty, rather than the master side'd read
returning 0, it's an EIO.  Seems to be this code, from n_tty.c.
	if (test_bit(TTY_OTHER_CLOSED, &tty->flags)) {
		retval = -EIO;
		break;
	}
I'm not an expert, it might be correct, but I thought I should point it
out.

Rich Paul
