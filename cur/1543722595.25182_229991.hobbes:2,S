I think Jari's point is that it's providing O=/something *even* when the
calling code *DOES* know that /foo is a better directory, so when you pass it
O=/foo because you know it's The Right Thing for Your Particular Random System,
it gets overridden.
Either that, or I need to find more caffeine, and re-parse what Jari wrote... ;)
