It's a big "depends". Some SCSI controllers will assign BIOS
id's for everything found on the bus, starting at 0x80 for
an ID. Others don't. In fact, some will assign a CD/ROM to
0x00 (Drive A) even if it doesn't contain a boot record. When
that assignment occurs, it's space in the boot-order gets
filled in with the next available drive. It's a mess and you
can't count on anything except that 0x80 will be lowest numbered
"fixed-disk" drive found. That's why you should boot from it,
even if the BIOS allows you to boot from others.
