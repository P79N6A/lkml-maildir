It sounded good to me and that's what the driver does now.  The patch I
sent to Alan (and the list I think) made it into pre6.  Actually, I don't
have any documentation on the SAx, so the driver treats it just like a SA3,
which has been working fine so far.  
Originally, I was unsure of the version numbering because I only had the
'4' that my own SAx card yielded to go on.  Hopefully, Yamaha haven't done
anything odd that will screw up this new scheme.  If anyone knows where I
can find docs for the SAx (YMF719 chipset), I'd appreciate looking at them.
