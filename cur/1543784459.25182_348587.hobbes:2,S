Ah thanks. That makes things a lot of clearer.
I found out that my attemption were true: the plugin really gets a KILL
signal if it exceeds the timeout. Means that the nagios check plugin is
the source of the problem (in combination with that what you did explain
AND the process which uses the ncpfs regulary and is running constant).
Now we found a solution for that. We just start the always
running process with a lower priority. That makes ncpfs access possible
while this process is running and producing load. Now: If we have the
always running process running, with low priority (nice +5), and the
nagios plugin tries to do something on the ncpfs it is able to, runs
fine and exits gracefully. Problem solved, at least until we find a
solution that does not look like a workaround ;-)
Thanks for your help! You helped me very much.
Bye
Patrick
