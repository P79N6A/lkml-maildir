For what it's worth.
A simple network application of mine which runs nightly began freezing the
day I installed 2.2.14 (from 2.2.13) and stopped freezing the day I
installed 2.2.15pre3.
When I would observe this, the worker threads would be stuck in either
FIN_WAIT or CLOSE_WAIT (I don't remember which).
I never had a freeze in 2.2.13.  I've never had a freeze in 15pre3.  I
never had time to look into it, so I suppose it could be something else.  
But the facts seem to fit.
