I have always wanted to ask this question, and this seems like an
appropriate thread.
Coming from a Free/OpenBSD background, I have always really liked
the sysctl MIB.  The sysctl command line too allows values to be manipulated
and read easily (much easier than parsing the /proc entries).
Why does Linux deprecate that use?  Why has is opted for a /proc
interface?
I do wish that BSD would implement a /sysctl or something interface for
browsing, but then again, that is what 'sysctl -a | grep' is for :)
