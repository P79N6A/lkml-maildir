Hello,
with the complete patch (s.b.) the kernel did kill processes while running
make -j100. So I tried only the second part of the patch (the SetPage-part)
and here are the results (this time only the make -j100 part:
2.4.14-pre8vmscan2:   6:12.06
2.4.14-pre8vmscan2:   6:41.43
2.4.14-pre8vmscan2:   6:53.22
2.4.14-pre8vmscan2:   7:12.03
2.4.14-pre8vmscan2:   5:49.82
I will run the whole test tonight and I will keep you posted. If you
want me to try a different patch, just let me know.

Well, yeah ... I suppose there's no point in getting greedy, is there?
