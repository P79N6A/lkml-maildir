Data communications except ethernet:
  kilobit == 1000 bits
  megabit == 1024 kilobits
Ethernet:
  speeds are measured in millions of bits
  transfer rates are measured in kilobytes == 1024 bytes or megabytes ==
  1024 kilobytes
Hard disks:
  SI (base 10 exponent increment 3) (hard disk manufacturers)
  modified SI (base 2 exponent increment 10)
Everything else (?) in computers:
  modified SI (base 2 exponent increment 10)
Clear as mud?
