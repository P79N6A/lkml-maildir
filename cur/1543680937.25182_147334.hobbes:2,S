Correct

I fail to see the logic in that. Reads are now treated fairly wrt
writes, but it would be really easy to let writes consume the entire
capacity of the queue (be it all the requests, or just going oversized).
I think the oversized logic is flawed right now, and should only apply
to writes. Always let reads get through. And don't let writes consume
the last 1/8th of the requests, or something like that at least. I'll
try and do a patch for pre4.
