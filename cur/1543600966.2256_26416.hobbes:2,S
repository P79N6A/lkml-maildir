Try to play with the "-b" option to get a correct blocking size. 10,
20, and 40 are useful numbers to try. It worked for me with a DLT 7000
tape drive connected to an SGI Origin200, though IRIX is not that
verbose in its error messages.

In my experience the brand of tapes doesn't matter. We use a mix of
Sony, Quantum, and Fuji tapes without any problem.
