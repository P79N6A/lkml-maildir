Use enable/disable_lapic_nmi_watchdog but first  check to see whether 
nmi_watchdog == NMI_IO_APIC in which case you'd then call 
disable/enable_timer_nmi_watchdog. Something like;
void swsuspend_disable_nmi_watchdog(void)
{
	if ((nmi_watchdog == NMI_IO_APIC) && (smp_processor_id() == 0)) {
		disable_timer_nmi_watchdog();
		return;
	}
	disable_lapic_nmi_watchdog();
}
void swsuspend_enable_nmi_watchdog(void)
{
	if ((nmi_watchdog == NMI_IO_APIC) && (smp_processor_id() == 0)) {
		enable_timer_nmi_watchdog();
		return;
	}
	enable_lapic_nmi_watchdog();
}
Do note that this has to be run on all processors, holla if there is 
anything else.
Thanks,
