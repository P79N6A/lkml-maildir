Hi Gérard,
We have finaly tracked the problem down with Motorola.
There is a major hardware problem with the Hawk-2 ASIC used as the main
PCI/Memory bridge on the MCPN765 board that causes a hardware lockup with
the BVM SCSI controller and probably other devices as well.
The problem is related to null byte enables.
There is no software work around, however the Hawk-3 chip fixes the problem.
Thanks for looking at this.
