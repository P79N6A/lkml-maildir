Maybe this is a know issue, but nonetheless.....
I have dual coppermine/930 machine with 1.2G ram, kernel 2.4.5. I used
reiserfs for my  /home and /var partitions. When tried downgrading to
2.2.19, I got errors  in syslog like 'can't find superblock' ... ( I don't
have them, /var wasn't mounted, and i had to return the machine in
production state... ). Does someone has any idea about this, how could I
downgrade to 2.2.19 ?
