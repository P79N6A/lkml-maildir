I've found that if I boot a machine without a PS/2 mouse plugged in then I
can't get the mouse to be recognised unless I reboot.  This used to not be a
problem (when psaux was a module).
Is there some way now of recognising a mouse after boot?

I plan to work in London until April and then move to another
place where the pay is good.
