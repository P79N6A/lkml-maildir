Hmmm...  It would appear that English's being my mother tongue is not
helping me as much as one might hope.  ;-)

Good point, I may just need to invert the whole thing, so that it
becomes something like:
	i.	Probability of missing a deadline due to software,
		ranging from 0 to 1, with the value of 0 corresponding
		to the hardest possible hard realtime.
But then the "p^n" becomes "1-(1-p)^n".  Bleah.
OK, how about the following?
	i.	Probability of meeting a deadline in absence of hardware
		failure, ranging from 0 to 1, with the value of 1
		corresponding to the hardest possible hard realtime.
							Thanx, Paul
