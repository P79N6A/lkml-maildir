I think the manual page wording makes perfect sense. The kernel is serving
the application, and it is in the interest of the application to get a
guarantee on the upper bound of the timeout. It is of course in the
interest of the _kernel_, whose task is to sensibly allocate the host's
resources to all processes, to make the timeout as long as possible (but
within bounds of the requested timeout.)
If we make 'timeout' the lower bound, then by the same logic it would be
perfectly fine for a conforming select to never return.
