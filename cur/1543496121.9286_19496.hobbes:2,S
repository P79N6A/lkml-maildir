Hi all...
I'm pretty new to the world of C programming, in fact I'm just getting my
feet wet after years of Pascal and Assembly.  So please forgive me if I am
missing something here, I'm not the C guru that I would like to be (at
least not yet).
I was looking at the code in atyfb.c and trying to figure out why my ATI
All-In-Wonder Pro 8MB (ATI Rage Pro Turbo) will not work with framebuffer.
It looks, from looking at the source, that the ChipRev and chip_id are not
being set properly.  I tried hacking my source to plug in values for some
of the other chipsets, but got no positive results.
I'm wondering where to go next.  It looks like there is an array
aty_features (forgive me if my term isn't correct, like I said I'm really
new to C) and that array doesn't appear to have a listing for my chipset.
I am considering using the Serial Console to see if it displays some
useful information (like chipset revision, etc) before the screen goes
nuts.
If anyone has any other ideas, please let me know.  I, in the meantime,
am going to be doing some serious studying of my "Learning C" books
because it's high time I got better at C.
Thanks,
Brian
