I've decided to CC lkml because I think there are other people interested
in this discussion.
I merged his version because he sent me your update (0.1.8) plus his code
(which are useful fixes he has been working on).
It seems things are broken now due to a missing header, but he also sent
me that.
Do you have any objections to his fixes ?
