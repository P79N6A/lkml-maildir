This is the same argument that managers at Sun, HP, SGI, IBM, and the
company formly known as DEC used.  There are a million and one things
you could ask for in the kernel and they are just like cache line misses.
Nobody notices them when you look at them one at a time but 5 years later
you wake up and your kernel is full of misguided, half finished, poorly
thought out ideas that make it impossible to do anything worthwhile.
It's a lot like your diet.  One beer isn't going to hurt you, but to
use the "one beer isn't going to hurt you" argument to justify drinking
a zillion different beers is not smart.
So why pick on DSM?  Because of all the misguided, half finished, poorly
thought out ideas out there, this one is one of the most studied and
proven mistakes in the history of computing.  If we can't keep this
sort of thing out of the kernel, we might as well pack it up and go
run Solaris.
