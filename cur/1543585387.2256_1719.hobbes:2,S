Subject: Bug-report: SCSI related hang doing INQUIRY (DC390 card, 2.4.x kernels)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Summary: My system freezes *completely* when doing an INQUIRY under 2.4.x
kernels. SCSI card is a Tekram DC390. Only inquiries to the DISK device cause a
hang, others succeed.
System details: AMD K63-400MHz, 128 Mb RAM, 1 IDE drive, 1 SCSI controller
(DC390) plus (output of cat /proc/scsi/scsi):
Attached devices: 
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00

  Type:   Scanner                          ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Sending an INQUIRY to the first device in the above list causes
the system to hang. No error messages, no oops, nothing.
This occurs with both cdrecord -scanbus and find-scanner (from SANE).
Using find-scanner, I can send INQUIRIES to only the last three devices without
problems. Sending an INQUIRY to just the first will hang the system.
This occurs under 2.4.0-4G (from standard SUSE 7.1 installation) and 2.4.2, the
latter both with and without the SCSI subsystem compiled as modules. There are
no problems under 2.2.18.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm not subscribed to the list, so
please explicitly email me any replies straw_broom@rice.edu (removing straw_
first).
Thanks,
Bradley Broom
