With open you are implying being able to use different ones.  It would
be nice to get one in and make sure it is stable and optimized...

hmm, non-container world (and its resource management part) already
exist.  And sure those requirements are superset of this discussion.
And hopefully container support will not break/modify that much.

A single centralized structure that has fields that are mostly used by
every one should be okay I think.

I'm sure when container support gets in then for the above scenario it
will read -1 ...
