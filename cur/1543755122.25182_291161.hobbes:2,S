Yes, it is a PCI radeon.  And the machine has an AGP slot
too, which is used by a matrox G550.  This AGP card was not
used in the test, (other than being the VGA console).
Note that there is no crash if I don't compile 
AGP support, so the crash is related to AGP somehow even though
AGP is not supposed to be used in this case.
As I start X (on the radeon) I notice that the VGA console 
I'm using (on the G550 AGP) goes black.  I see no need for that either,
the radeon display is a _different_ device so why black out 
the vgacon?  Could the problem lurk there somehow?
