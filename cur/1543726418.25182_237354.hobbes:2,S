Thanks for doing the initial work!

Indeed, when using this board for real we generally recommend
exactly the same thing.

Unfortunately, LSB does not provide a set of test binaries which
use the softfloat ABI, so in order to get an LSB-comformant distribution
on this CPU, we need to use floating point emulation.  Interestingly,
this is the only LSB floating point test which fails.
