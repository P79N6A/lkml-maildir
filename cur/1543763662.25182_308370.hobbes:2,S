Correct -- that one worked already in Debian-Installer. What was 
confusing is that the Gigabyte K8NS Ultra-939 board has a second 
gigabyte NIC, identified in the motherboard manual as a 100/10 ICS1883 
LAN PHY, that is in fact an nforce gigabyte controller, part of the 
nforce3 250 chipset (cf. 
http://cogweb.net/owens/Images/Gigabyte-K8NS-Ultra-939.jpg
 line 5). For 
some reason the PCI ID 00E6 doesn't show up in lspci, so I thought it 
was not detected by the kernel. However, the forcedeth driver brought it 
to life.
