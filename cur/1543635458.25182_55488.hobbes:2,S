tcp_recvmsg() only does the copy from the receive_queue
or the backlog queue. tcp_rcv_established() does the copy
directly into the iovec or queues it onto the receive_queue 
or backlog queue for tcp_recvmsg() to complete the work. So 
there arent two copies of the same data happening, just a 
question of one or the other function doing the work depending 
on whether there is currently a process doing a read or not..
hth,
thanks,
