   Where's the problem to compute them automatically?
It requires ugly scripts that parse assembler files if you want it to
work in a cross compilation requirement.  Check out
arch/sparc64/kernel/check_asm.sh and the "check_asm" rule in the
Makefile or the same directory in older trees to see what I mean.
