Subject: [PATCH] [MMC] Minimise protocol awareness in Au1x00 driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/6/432

The Au1x00 MMC/SD driver currently contains switch statements based on
protocol opcodes, not on desired behaviour.
Unfortunately the AMD specification is not detailed enough to determine
how the controller will behave for the response settings. For now, it will
have to suffice to warn when we have an unknown response type.
