Very good!
Unfortunately, these days there are many new keyboards, with dozens
of new keys, so it is impossible to assign each key its own keycode
(since for the time being keycodes are restricted to the range 1-127).
Fortunately, Linux already has a mechanism to deal with this:
the utility setkeycodes. (OK in kbd, broken in some distributions
that use console-tools.)
So, it looks like your kernel patch is equivalent to the command
        # setkeycodes  e05e 124  e05f 123  e063 122
See setkeycodes(8) and also
