Yup. CLONE_THREAD has some new semantics these days, and is not
necessarily at all what a kernel thread wants any more. It used to not
matter at all, but these days it means that it gets put on the same thread
group list as the parent, which means that it won't show up on the global
list of processes any more (since it is considered a "subthread" of the
thread group leader).
