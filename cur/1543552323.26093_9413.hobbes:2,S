I had a problem like this.  The solution was to use an 80 wire
cable.  Even for UDMA/33 and even though it shouldn't be needed.  I
had tried at least two different 40 wire IDE cables, each within
the UDMA/33 specs.
I'm guessing that there is a lot of noise in my cabinent and/or
perhaps the motherboard has a significant internal trace length.
MB = ASUS P2BD-S.  Drive is a Seagate 9.1 or maybe 10GB.
I was also able to get UDMA working in something like mode 0 with
the 40 wire cable.
