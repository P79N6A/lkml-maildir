On my system I get a starvation issue with just about any CPU intensive
task.  For example if create a bzip'd tar file from the linux kernel
source with the command:
tar cvp linux | bzip2 -9 > linux.tar.bz2
During this entire time I can switch between different windows and
everything seems great, but if a try to do something like run 'ps ax' or
login to another virtual terminal, or start almost any other program, it
takes 30-45 seconds or longer.
With 2.5.64 doing the same 'tar | bzip2' command above takes nearly the
same length of time, but I can go about my business of running other
programs without any of the above issue.  It's basically seems that the
one process is starving out everything else.
Don't know if this info helps, but it's 100% reproducible on my machine
(a Dell C810 laptop with a 1.13Ghz P3) with both 2.5.65 & 66.
Later,
Tom
