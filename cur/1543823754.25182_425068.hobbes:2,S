You do have a point that there's an inconsistency there.  But we could
argue a long time what's inconsistent with what - I'd say it's mlock
being inconsistent with mprotect, munmap, msync, madvise, etc.  I
don't see an outright reason to change from the current behaviour.
You do realize that there's almost no point in mlocking a hugepage area
anyway?  (I wrote that first without the "almost", but now with hugepage
faulting, it does provide another way to fault in all the pages at once.)
