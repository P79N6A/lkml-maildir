it's an option, and the default is to use the hlt instruction. The main
reason is to let Linux save power - and those who need that final
performance edge (and it's measurable), can enable it. HTL still uses less
power than the tight idle loop.

but even in the Athlon case an IPI is still an IRQ entry, which will add
at least 200 cycles or more to the idle wakeup latency.
