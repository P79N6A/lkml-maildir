Subject: SPARC64: Configuration offers keyboards that don't make sense
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

On my Sun I get the following offers:
   AT Keyboard
   Sun types 4 and 5
   DECstation LK201/LK401
   XT keyboard
   Newton keyboard
Unless I am very mistaken, only the second one applies?
Also, configuring this one gives a non-functional keyboard (the machine is
running, I can log in over SSH, but keypresses have no effect at all).
Should I be looking elsewhere for SPARC support?
Thanks!
