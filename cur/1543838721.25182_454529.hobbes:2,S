My points against allowing to compile kernel 2.4 with gcc 4 are:
- There isn't much testing coverage - and will never be much testing
  coverage - of using a kernel 2.4 compiled with gcc 4.
  We've already seen several cases where only some compiler versions
  caused miscompilations or exposed a runtime bug in the kernel.
  Since there shouldn't be any reason for still using a 2.4 kernel
  except for "never change a running system", I don't see a good
  reason for allowing such an untested gcc/kernel combination.
- Even if your distribution does no longer ship any gcc 3, it's
  easy building and using your own gcc 3.4.6:
    wget 
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-3.4.6/gcc-3.4.6.tar.bz2
    tar xjf gcc-3.4.6.tar.bz2
    mkdir build-gcc
    cd build-gcc
    ../gcc-3.4.6/configure --enable-languages=c --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-3.4.6
    make bootstrap
    make install
    # change HOSTCC and CC in the toplevel Makefile of the kernel:
    # HOSTCC = /usr/local/gcc-3.4.6/bin/gcc
    # CC = /usr/local/gcc-3.4.6/bin/gcc

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
