I also claim that Slashdot people usually are smelly and eat their 
boogers, and have an IQ slightly lower than my daughters pet hamster 
(that's "hamster" without a "p", btw, for any slashdot posters out 
there. Try to follow me, ok?).
Furthermore, I claim that anybody that hasn't noticed by now that I'm an 
opinionated bastard, and that "impolite" is my middle name, is lacking a 
few clues.
Finally, it's clear that I'm not only the smartest person around, I'm also 
incredibly good-looking, and that my infallible charm is also second only 
to my becoming modesty. 
So there. Just to clarify.
