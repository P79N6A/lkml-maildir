Changing the size of the devices is a separate operation that has been
supported for a while.
For each device in turn, you fail it and replace it with a larger
device. (This means the array runs degraded for a while, which isn't
ideal and might be fixed one day).
Once all the devices in the array are of the desired size, you run
  mdadm --grow /dev/mdX --size=max
and the array (raid1, raid5, raid6) will use up all available space on
the devices, and a resync will start to make sure that extra space is
in-sync.
