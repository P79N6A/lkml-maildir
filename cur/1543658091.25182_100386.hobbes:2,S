I did that originally, but timings from Jamie convinced me that it's 
actually a quite noticeable overhead for the system call path.
You should realize that the 5-9% slowdown in schedule (which I don't like)  
comes with a 360% speedup on a P4 in simple system call handling (which I
_do_ like). My P4 does a system call in 428 cycles as opposed to 1568
cycles according to my benchmarks.
And part of the reason for the huge speedup is that the vsyscall/sysenter
path is actually pretty much the fastest possible. Yes, it would have been
faster just from using sysenter/sysexit, but not by 360%. The other
speedups come from not reloading segment registers multiple times
(noticeable on a PIII, not a P4) and from avoiding things liek the flags
pushing.
NOTE! We could trivially speed up the task switching by making 
"load_esp0()" a bit smarter. Right now it actually re-writes _both_ 
SYSENTER_CS and SYSENTER_ESP on a taskswitch, and that's because a process 
that was in vm86 mode will have cleared SYSENTER_CS (so that sysenter will 
cause a GP fault inside vm86 mode).
Now, that SYSENTER_CS thing is very rare indeed, and by keeping track of 
what the previous value was (ie just caching the SYSENTER_CS value in the 
thread_struct), we could get rid of it with a conditional jump instead. 
Want to try it?

Nope, it wouldn't. A "popfl" in user mode does nothing for iopl. You have 
to have the popfl in kernel mode.
