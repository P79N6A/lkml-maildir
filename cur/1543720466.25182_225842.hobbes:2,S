Please do so. As Bartlomiej note the rule is to keep drivers under:
drivers/<subsystem>/<arch>
The most efficient way to do the move is to send Linus a direct
mail with a simple shell script that does the moving of the files.
Along the lines of:
mkdir -p drivers/ide/cris
mv arch/cris/drivers/ide/* drivers/ide/cris
etc.
