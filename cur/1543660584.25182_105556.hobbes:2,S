   So, the above patch is probably the wrong thing to do.  I'll need to
   check to be sure, but I think that h/w reset clears MSGINT_MODE_ENABLE,
   so we wouldn't want to be randomly enabling it when it is purposefully
   disabled.
   DaveM/Jeff, corrections?
You're right Jeff, I hadn't noticed the forced enabling of MSI, that
is totally wrong.
