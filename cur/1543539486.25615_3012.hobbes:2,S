    I hope so. I've gotten mixed reports about it - some people say
    it is fine since about 99-pre4 or so, yet I have some
    confusion-reports about later kernels too. They _might_ be pilot
    error, so..
If it is broken -- then it is less so than the 2.3.99-pre kernels.
Back then most certainly I couldn't use it, these days I use it all
the time -- and I've yet to had it fail on a recent kernel.
