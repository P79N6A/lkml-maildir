Are you serious?  It really is true that vga= isn't supposed to work in
2.6.0, but there is something to do with RedHat 7.3 which caused vga= to
continue to work in 2.6.0 with that distro only?  Then why hasn't the vga=
parameter been removed entirely?

I forgot if Dan is using RH8 or RH9.  Whichever, you're getting different
results than he did, because his failed with one of these and yours works
with both.  At least my failures with SuSE are consistent.  I'd say the
overall inconsistency points to a bug in 2.6.0-test* and .0.  Especially
when no one seems to be reporting similar failures in the 2.4 series.
