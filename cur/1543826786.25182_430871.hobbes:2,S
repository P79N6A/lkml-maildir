Right -- I asked our local radio wizard (so I could get more details)
and taking into account that each band is 1584 MHz wide at a max of
-41.3 dBm/Mhz, it yields something like 117 uW per band. He also added 
that once you consider all the fine points it goes down to 100uW per
band 
(-10dBm).
To answer Pavel's question on hardware power consumption, I don't really
know -- too early to tell; however, whoever architected the technology
was keeping in mind a target market similar to bluetooth's, really small
devices and embedded, home entertainment, cell phones, printers, cameras
and the like; it'll be pretty low.
