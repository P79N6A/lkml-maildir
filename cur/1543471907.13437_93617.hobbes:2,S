Well, /home/lgb is just a symlink. With access it by /home/lgb (eg : ls)
it will be appeared the symlink itself, while with /home/lgb/ it will
appeared as the directory the link points to. But in this case it's strange
for me that 'du' can't see anything in BOTH cases only if I give the pointed
directory. However I think it's not the perfect logical way somewhere ...
