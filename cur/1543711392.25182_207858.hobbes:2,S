OK, now I had the time to test if different C states are working with 
following three kernels:
1. 2.6.4-mm2 without the 8259-timer-ack-fix.patch and without the C1halt idle 
function.
2. 2.6.4-mm2 with the 8259-timer-ack-fix.patch and without the C1 halt idle 
function enabled.
3. 2.6.4-mm2 with the 8259-timer-ack-fix.patch and with the C1 halt idle 
function enabled.
I used following script to print the C-state counters on an complete idle 
machine before and after a 10second interval:
# /bin/sh
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
sleep 10
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
Now the results:
1.:

So, as you can see, the C1halt patch does not help here... ;-(
