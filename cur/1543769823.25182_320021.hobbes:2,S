Well, I don't mean to activate cpufreq.  Rather cpufreq may be
sometimes the cause of output noises.
Does the noise also on the analog loopback, e.g. CD or line-in?
If yes, it's likely a problem of hardware, either the broken h/w or
the bad plug/cable.  Or, it's an inproper mixer configuration.
To check the mixer configuration, show the contents of
/etc/asound.state (it's generated via "alsactl store"), and
/proc/asound/card0/codec97#0/* files.
OTOH, if this happens only on PCM, it's often an interrupt problem
(typically ACPI) or the influence of cpufreq...
