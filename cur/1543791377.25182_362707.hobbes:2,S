1. A couple of symbols would have to be artifically generated
    to keep the loader happy.
2. New and delete are a bitch.
3. Link will fail because of the hidden stuff C++ needs that it
    can't find. Okay, just generate some dummy symbols in asm,
    all pointing to the same junk.
4. Once you got it to load, gigantic stack usage will crash.
So much for C++. Just use C. He probably didn't remember that
it's a simpler variant. If he knows C++, he knows C, but just
needs to do more things that C++ did for him.
Cheers,
