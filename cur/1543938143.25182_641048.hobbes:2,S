For everything but timer, you'll get a warning if the data isn't assignable to 
a void *, so you get a warning if you use a non-pointer already.
But it would be cool to allow functions which take an unsigned long.  To do 
this, I think that would need to be a special case for the data arg (which 
we'd really want to wrap in a macro), like:
	/* If fn expects an unsigned long, cast the data.  If not, we'll
	 * get a warning if data is not void * compatible. */
	__builtin_choose_expr(__builtin_compatible_p(typeof(1?(threadfn):NULL),
			      int (*)(unsigned long)),
			      (void *)(unsigned long)(data), (data))

Hmm, u64 on 32-bit platforms?  I think that will fail the above test: the type 
of the function ptr will be "int (*)(u64)" and so you'll end up passing data 
(a u64) to a void * argument, which will elicit a warning...
I'll test this out and see what I can make...
Thanks!
Rusty.
