Yep.  8:)

|
| 	/* add the fd to the interest set */
| 	do_add_fd_to_the_interest_set();
|

|
| static struct epitem *ep_find_nl(struct eventpoll *ep, int fd)
| {
...
| }
|

| adds to this code ?
nada.
Just to be clear (and reiterate), my comments were not about
the epoll patch, but about adding new features/kernel APIs/etc
in general.
