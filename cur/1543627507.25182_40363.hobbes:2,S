	In fact, you have no reason whatsoever to believe the memory is leaking. 
It's just being *used*.

	If you don't want the memory to be used, take it out of the system and let 
it sit on your desk. If you put the memory in the system, the system assumes 
that you want to use it. It keeps data in memory that it would otherwise 
throw away, that we if it's used again, it doesn't have to be fetched from 
disk.
