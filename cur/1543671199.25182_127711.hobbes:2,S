What makes you think you can read the BIOS?

Yes, that's the severe version of DRM that we're talking about, for
the game server scenario.

We don't know for sure that it's not possible to make something
reverse engineering proof.  Although all current CPUs require code to
be decrypted at some point, there may be modules of computation that
don't require that, so there would be no way to extract the secret key
or decryption process in a useful way even when you can see every
electronic signal in a device.  The jury is out on it, despite what
slashdotters believe.
