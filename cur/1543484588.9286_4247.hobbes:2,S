No, I didnt write that.
Please check your attributions.
    What's the problem with allowing recursive semaphores? It doesn't break
    anything which wasn't broken before. The only difference is that now your
    code can continue while before it would deadlock.
I have no opinion yet about these recursive semaphores.
But from the reports it seems that scsi_error was broken by the change.
