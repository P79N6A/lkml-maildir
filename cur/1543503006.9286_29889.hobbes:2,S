Yes, the memory init code really should do that. 
I can't honestly claim that this was my "intention". It's obviously the
right thing to do, but I never even thought about it, so claiming intent
would be lying.
But yes, that is definitely how the iomem resource is supposed to be used.

No, ioremap() (which is what I assume you're talking about, rather than
vmalloc()) should not actually grab the region. One reason for that is
that ioremap() doesn't even know who it grabs it for, another reason is
that it's actually not illegal to have multiple mappings to the same
object.
It should really be the driver that does the allocation, and after it has
allocated the region it should do the remapping to actually get a window
into the region.
For example, let's say that you have a subsystem like PCMCIA that
allocates a region for itself, but it may not actually do the ioremap()
because the PCMCIA code is not necessarily ever going to actually _use_
that resource itself: it only allocated it so that it has something to
give to the real cards when they are actually inserted. The actual
low-level driver may be the one who really does the ioremap(), so
ioremap() clearly cannot do the allocation as that has been done earlier.
Very few drivers actually do the iomem (I'm trying to come to grips with
the new name ;) allocation. It didn't use to exist, so it's only been
added for a few drivers. If anybody wants to send in driver updates, or
the above architecture memory initialization, that would be appreciated.

Note that "real memory" is actually "io memory" when seen by any PCI bus
master device. So "real" is in the eyes of the beholder ;)
