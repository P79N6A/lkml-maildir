<BODY>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; If I want to do a DMA operation in a character driver, i </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; believe i have </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; to&nbsp; use physical memory. ( by getting kvirt_to_phys() ). </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Is there a fear of this memory getting swapped out while the DMA </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; operation is in progress.? If so, then there must be some mechanism of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; locking the pages in the driver. What are the utilities available for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; locking kernel virtual memory.? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>There have been several threads discussing this over the past few weeks.&nbsp; One such thread was &quot;Process VM Addr to Kernel VM Addr at Interrupt Time&quot;.&nbsp; You'll want to see our comments in there.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Currently, there is no standard mechanism for doing this in the kernel.&nbsp; Instead, you must vmalloc() or kmalloc() memory and use mmap() to map the kernel memory into the application space.&nbsp; (See the bttv driver in the 2.2.x kernels for an example)&nbsp; The second method is to use bounce buffers (e.g. copy_from_user), though your CPU utilization will be high if you do this.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>There is real work going on to support user space I/O.&nbsp; If your driver is a block driver, there is a Raw I/O patch already out there; see Stephen Tweedie (sct@redhat.com) with questions or comments about that.&nbsp; It's at <A HREF="
