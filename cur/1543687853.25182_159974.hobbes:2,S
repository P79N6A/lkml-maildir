Hi Thomas,
Your patch works beautifully. 'acpi=nopci' previously caused IDE to work 
fine, but made the kernel not detect USB and network devices. With your 
patch it sees all peripherals AND acpi is available for the cpu. I wonder 
if it would be accepted into the kernel as a patch to workaround buggy acpi 
bioses.
Thanks heaps!
- Peter.
