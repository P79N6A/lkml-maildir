I'd sort of rather not; why should that legacy struct space_resv be
available in a header... I thought this was for people already using the
xfs ioctl, in which case they are already using the xfs header... and if
they want preallocation in any new work, they should use fallocate()
instead, yes?
I mean it wouldn't hurt anything but it sort of confuses the interface
story IMHO.
