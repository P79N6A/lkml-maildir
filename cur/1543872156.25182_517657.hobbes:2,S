see my mail to you below: you've been told about the clockevents problem 
months ago, that you shouldnt hardwire PIT details and that you should 
be registering a clockevents device. You cannot credibly claim that you 
didnt know about this.

i've specifically objected, numerous times - the result of which was 
that when you submitted it to lkml you didnt Cc: me ;) The VMI crap went 
in 'under the radar' via the x86_64 tree.

Also, it was /you/ who claimed that paravirt_ops can take care of 
whatever design change on the Linux side - that claim is apparently 
history now and you are now claiming "there's a product on the road, we 
cannot change the hypervisor ABI"? Should i cite that email of yours 
too?

(I've Cc:-ed Rusty too, the author of the paravirtualization patches. 
Rusty, what's your take on the VMI timer patchset of Zach?)
in any case, i dont see any fundamental problem here. The right model 
for timer paravirtualization is to notify the guest during early bootup 
that this is a paravirtual bootup. Then the guest doesnt even register 
the PIT clocksource but registers the virtual clock-events driver.
