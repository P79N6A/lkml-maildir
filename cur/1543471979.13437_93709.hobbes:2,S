Hi,
Please note there are 2 patches included in this mail:
  The first patch (to nfs/read.c) fixes a problem with page locking
that can occur if the call to nfs_wb_page in nfs_readpage fails. This
may be the cause of the hanging processes that people have recently
reported. The same problem exists in stock 2.1.131.
  The second patch attempts to implement some small speedups in
nfs/write.c
Enjoy,
  Trond
