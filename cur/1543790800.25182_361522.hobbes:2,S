I think it's a gcc bug. Anyways, this should work around it.
Linus, can you please apply it?

Work around gcc bug that causes build failures like
(exact function it is reported on varies with compiler version and optimization
level)

> arch/x86_64/pci/../../i386/pci/fixup.c:13: error: pci_fixup_i450nx causes a section type conflict
with !CONFIG_HOTPLUG. It makes the !CONFIG_HOTPLUG case act
like CONFIG_HOTPLUG. This wastes a bit of memory, but is not
too bad.
The sections are legitimate, but gcc somehow gets confused.
Compiling with -O3 seems to also help at least with gcc 4, but I'm
not sure it'll help everything. Splitting up the file might
a different option.
