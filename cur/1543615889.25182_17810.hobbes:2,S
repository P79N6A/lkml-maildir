I see, I got mistaken because here we're not in a i_sem-less writepage, so
in those cases I wanted to always deallocate the blocks rather than
lefting zeroed leftovers. if the leftover blocks are over i_size (common
case I was thinking about incidentally :) that's automatica with
->truncate, but if they aren't over i_size that's not enough and we miss
a lowlevel API to decallocate a range of blocks, so your patch is the
only way indeed.
