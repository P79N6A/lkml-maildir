Since latency is a direct function of lock held times in the preemptible
kernel, and I am seeing disgusting zap_page_range() latencies, the lock
is held a long time.
So we know it is held forever and a day... but is there contention?

I do not recall seeing this either and I have not done my own tests.
Personally, I would love to rip out the "cond_resched_lock()" and just
do
	spin_unlock();
	spin_lock();
and be done with it.  This gives automatic preemption support and the
SMP benefit.  Preemption being an "automatic" consequence of improved
locking was always my selling point (albeit, this is a gross example of
improving the locking, but it gets the job done).
But, the current implementation was more palatable to you and Linus when
I first posted this, and that counts for something.
