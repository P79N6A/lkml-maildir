Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Martin,
    I've run into a stack overflow problem during boot that is caused by the
pci subsystem.  The function pci_do_scan_bus() puts a pci_dev on the stack,
and then indirectly calls itself recursively.  While this doesn't usually
cause any problems, the stack will overflow when there are a large number of
cascaded pci buses.
    This patch will fix the problem in the 2.5.30 kernel.  I discovered the
problem in the 2.4.18 kernel, and for anyone who wants to patch that kernel,
the same patch will work if you change "probe.c" to "pci.c"
Thanks,
Jason Zebchuk
