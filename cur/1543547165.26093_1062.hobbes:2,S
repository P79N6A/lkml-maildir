Does <version> also include the build number (i.e. the first part of
UTS_VERSION) ? Is it resilient to patches where, by accident,
EXTRAVERSION or such hasn't been incremented ? Will people always
remember to copy /lib/modules/<version>/.config when copying a kernel
from a build machine to a target machine ?
Granted, all those are borderline cases, but then 1-2 kB doesn't look
like too high a price to pay for a solution that is inherently robust.
