hi,

yes ;)

my machines are athlon xp 1700+ and 2400+ so they should be fast enough...

oh, yes, i didn't think of that (my bad...) because i thought "it worked with 2.4 kernels".

yes, they are located in different rooms and connected via an 20m x-over cable through the wall (easier than affording a gbit switch ;))

thank you for the info! i searched their site, but i only found a reference to BACS on their faq page and that this software should be on their driver cdrom (well, it is not on my netgear cdrom).
but i'll test my cable with a fluke networks cable tester tomorrorw or on tuesday. i'll post the results if they are relevant.
i also tested with a knoppix cdrom on box2, which i can reboot, with 2.4.21 kernel and v1.5 tg3 driver, but the problem was also there so it really seems to be the cable...
thx,
JG
