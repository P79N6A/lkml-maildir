I don't know if this will help, but there were issues raised earlier
about older versions of udev causing hangs on newer kernels. Look for
the thread with the subject "2.6.12 udev hangs at boot". Actually,
look here: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111909806104523&w=2
Basically, upgrade to a newer udev if you're running an older one (I
think I had 0.30 at the time; installing 0.58 sped things up
noticeably).
HTH.
