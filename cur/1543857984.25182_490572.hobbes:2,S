Hi Andrew, thanks for your comments.
I sent two patches for the __attribute__((weak)) xtime_lock thing, and 
calc_load() optimization, which dont depend on ktimed.
Should I now send patches for aggregating things or is it considered too 
intrusive ? (Sorry if I didnt understand your last sentence)
If yes, should I send separate patches to :
1) define an empty ktimed (or with a placeholder for jiffies64, not yet used)
2) move xtime into ktimed
3) move xtime_lock into ktimed
4) move wall_to_monotonic into ktimed
5) move calc_load.count into ktimed
6) move avenrun into ktimed.
7) patches to use ktimed.jiffies64 on various arches (with the problem of 
aliasing jiffies)
Thank you
Eric
