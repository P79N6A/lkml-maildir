Can you try to sprinkle printk's around to see where it actually ends up 
stopping?
Since all special commands should now go through the taskfile interface 
(Bartlomiej - correct?), I guess just a printk() at the top of 
do_rw_taskfile() should at least get the ball rolling. Even something that 
just prints out task->data_phase and tf->command would start to unravel at 
least what the last command is before it hangs..
