Thats an important use case for EtherIP, thats right :-)
But people often use Ethernet over IP tunneling to transparently switch
between wired and wireless network connections on laptops (and secure
the WLAN path with IPSEC).
Xen also implements the EtherIP protocol in their vnet module.

Ok, I don't know if the Xerox implementation is still in use anywhere. I
can't find anything in the web about it. But it is mentioned in the RFC,
thats right. The interoperability issue with the BSDs is real. At least
of NetBSD I know that its implementation does not check the incoming
header because of that issue. My implementation also avoids this check.

Yes, thats right.

GRE additionally provides interoperability with some hardware devices.
But it does not provide compatibility to the BSDs.

Ok. I will maintain the driver outside the kernel for the next time.
Lets see if there are enough users for it :)
