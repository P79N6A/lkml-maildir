   If you want events, standardize events and push them over
   a queueing based communications channel to userspace, namely
   using netlink sockets.
It sounds like you are proposing a new family for the netlink
subsystem.  I've included a list of the families I see in 2.5.70
the end of this note.   I'm trying to understand which family handles
events such as link state changes or device initialization failure?
It sounds like you're proposing somethink equivalent to
NETLINK_TCP_DIAG.  Is that right?
There seems to be some overlap between netlink and netdev notifier
events.  Netdev notifier reports many key events.  One event I don't
see reported is any indication that device initialization failed.
#define NETDEV_UP               0x0001
#define NETDEV_DOWN             0x0002
#define NETDEV_REBOOT           0x0003
#define NETDEV_CHANGE           0x0004
#define NETDEV_REGISTER         0x0005
#define NETDEV_UNREGISTER       0x0006
#define NETDEV_CHANGEMTU        0x0007
#define NETDEV_CHANGEADDR       0x0008
#define NETDEV_GOING_DOWN       0x0009
#define NETDEV_CHANGENAME       0x000A
One issue with netdev, is that it doesn't seem to allow
for the flexibility of the information passed that netlink has.
For example, when you issue a NETDEV_CHANGE, it's not clear
from the event what the specific change was.
