Fully agreed.
Please come and attend the multipath session at the Kernel Summit and/or
the Ottawa Linux Symposium next week to learn why this is a bad idea and
how it can be done better -> 
http://www.linuxsymposium.org/
However, for backwards compatibility with 2.4, I assume it might still
be needed in 2.5/2.6, but _only_ with the clear intend of phasing it out
within 2.6 and dropping it in 2.7.
QLogic is reasonably good already in that it can be disabled via a
module parameter (ql2xfailover=0), allowing the higher level solutions
to operate.
Sincerely,
