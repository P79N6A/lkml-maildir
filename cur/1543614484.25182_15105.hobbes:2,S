When this happens in X, the mouse drags and skips, any processes running
(like tar/gzip. ls in an empty dir takes about 10 seconds) slow down,
and it happens usually for about 10sec-2min, often for no apparent
reason.  The big decompression was just a way I can easily duplicate
it.  Oddly enough though, according to top, it caches all that memory at
once, and my free goes down to 5 megs, with the system hanging/slow to
respond, for 10sec-2min.  Even typing in the console has delay before
the characters appear, and according to top, tar and gz are both using
under 1% cpu while this happens, and about 50% of the cpu is in use by
the system (not by any processes that I can see.  kupdated goes up to
about 0.3% during this)
