I would suppose so. Why wouldn't a machine supporting CPU hotplug not reasonably be able to double,
triple, etc the number of CPUs originally present?

That I can easily do, sure.

That is correct, but I wanted the fallback if kmalloc_node() fails (from briefly looking at that code it didn't
seem like it would do such fallback itself). And calling kmalloc() twice if !NUMA seemed pointless.

OK, will change that.

I can change that, too, but I don't see why this gets pointed out again and again when there really
is no consistency across the entire kernel...
