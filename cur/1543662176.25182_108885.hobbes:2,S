Subject: fix fadvise64() return type
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Please remember to declare the return-type of syscall stubs as "long".
On 64-bit platforms, it's generally necessary to ensure that the
entire 64-bit return value is valid (and can be checked against
negative values).
Thanks,
