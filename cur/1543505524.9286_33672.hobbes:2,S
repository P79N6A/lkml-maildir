With this patch applied I could compile the kernel, but the result 
fails to initialize my 53c810 adapter.
With 2.3.13 + Alans patch I get:
ncr53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 18, function 0
ncr53c8xx: disabling I/O mapping since base address 0 (0xe1000000)
           bits 0..1 indicate a non-IO mapping
ncr53c8xx: not initializing, both I/O and memory mappings disabled
whereas plain 2.2.11 gives:
ncr53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 18, function 0
ncr53c8xx: 53c810 detected 
ncr53c810-0: rev=0x02, base=0xe1000000, io_port=0x6100, irq=11
ncr53c810-0: ID 7, Fast-10, Parity Checking
ncr53c810-0: restart (scsi reset).
