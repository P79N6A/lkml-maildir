Tested on ATP865 (1191:0008 rev 07) in a DS101 box (an ARM-based NAS).
Seems to work fine.
However, I'm gettting consistently lower read throughput with pata_artop
(13-19 MB/s) than with aec62xx (22 MB/s) on an oldish WD drive, and using
pata_artop triggers a WARN_ON(irqs_disabled()) in arch/arm/mm/consistent.c:

So far I've only seen this happen when I run hdparm -Tt /dev/sda.
So something's still not quite right.
aec62xx is perfectly reliable on this box.
