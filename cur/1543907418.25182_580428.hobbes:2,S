If uevent_helper[0] is \0 then this function can return success, even
though it didn't deliver anything to userspace.
I suppose that's correct behaviour: the operator configured the system to
disable the hotplug callout.  However in this scenario, the firmware laoder
will still needlessly implement the grace period.
It's probably not worth worrying about.
