Well, it would work with any arch, _if_ there was a way to sync the 
streaming pci dma buffers before giving them back to hardware. Last time I 
checked there was no pci_dma api call to achieve this on all platforms. 
For X86 however it's trivial due to cache coherency.
The guy is used with X86 notebooks only - unless whoever owns the 
controller design decides to make some CardBus PC-Card for people with 
notebooks lacking IrDA-support.

Valid point, yes.

Thanks, second this.
