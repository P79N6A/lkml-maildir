best would be if you could pick the patches up (if they look good to 
you, and if they pass testing with CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES enabled), and 
thus they would flow upstream once you did a merge with Andrew or Linus
next time around.
we'll still keep them in -mm, just to get early feedback (and to make 
sure nothing is dropped on the floor), but the ultimate merging should 
happen via maintainers. [so that the mutex patches impact maintainer's 
workflow and their pending patches in the least minimal way.] If things 
clash with our mutex migration changes in -mm, we'll redo the affected 
-mm mutex patches whenever Andrew pulls a maintainer tree.
