Problem is very apparent from the tcpdump: your client is only
receiving 2 or 3 out of the 6 UDP fragments in the NFS read
reply from the server. The rest is getting lost en route.
Check out the NFS FAQ on nfs.sourceforge.net. The relevant section is
the bit that asks questions of the form:
   1) Are both server and client running on the same speed network
      (i.e. are both switched 100Mbit/100Mbit or 10Mbit/10Mbit)?
   2) If you are using a switch, are you also using autonegotiation,
      or have you forced one or both of the cards (forcing is *bad*
      if your switch/hub is autonegotiating)
Cheers,
  Trond
