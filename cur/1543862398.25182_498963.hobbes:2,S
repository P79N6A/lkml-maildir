Because I haven't finished converting all of the different usages of
struct class_device to struct device just yet.  When that happens, those
links go away, as the /sys/class/foo_class/foo is a symlink itself into
the /sys/devices/ tree.
If you look in the -mm tree there is a patch for the network devices,
and I have patches in my tree (but not -mm) for pcmcia, usb_host,
usb_device, and input.  These patches still need a bit of work before
sending them on to their relative maintainers for acceptance.
Hope this helps explain things,
