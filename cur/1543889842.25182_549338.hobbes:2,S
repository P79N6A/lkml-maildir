Sounds like an opportunity for improvement then.

I think that you're being generous calling it fragile, but that's
my view, and I've seen much worse. I agree that it would be a Bad Idea,
but the fact that I think it's a bad idea is not going to prevent very
many people from trying it, and for those that do try it name based
access control might seem like just the ticket to complete their
nefarious schemes. Remember that security is a subjective thing, and
using argv[0] and AppArmor together might make some people feel better.
