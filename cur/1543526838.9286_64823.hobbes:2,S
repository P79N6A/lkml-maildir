Me, too.  One thread isn't always enough; sometimes you need to pass 
connections from one thread to another, e.g. on a 64 processor machine
the listening thread might pass connections to a single worker thread
on each CPU to keep the load balanced.  (See 
http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html

OK, cool.  Don't know if we will get this race closed soon, but
it's nice that somebody else besides me now agrees it exists :-)

I think there's a patch you can apply.  See

Good point; it would be interesting to be able to calculate
the signal queue length needed for a particular program
to prevent signal queue overflow.  This would not be easy
in general, since you can get unexpected signals...

I think we're on the same wavelength.  Don't know how many
of these API rough edges can be smoothed over in the 2.3
kernel before 2.4 is released, but it'd be nice to have
(a) agreement that rough edges in the sigio api
makes writing sigio-based servers hard at the moment in 2.3,
and (b) a plan for smoothing out the rough edges.
