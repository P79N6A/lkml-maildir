I think the whole mess comes from the ambigious use of the word host in RFC
826, and several possible interpretations. It can mean both ethernet host
(i.e. a NIC) or internet host (i.e. the whole server). This isn't clear from
the RFC. In fact, the meanings are mixed. It's not a good RFC.
The linux way is a perfectly legal, if somewhat awkward, way to interpret
the RFC. Me too, I'd like a device respond only to ARP requests that are
meant for an IP bound to it, but please, let's not turn this into a holy
war.
Regards,
Bas
