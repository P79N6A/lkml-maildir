It's equally meaningless (in fact, less meaningful).
- By your definition my 900MHz VIA C3 is faster than my 800MHz Athlon.
  (Clue: It isn't).
- With trickery like AMD's quantispeed ratings, MHz really is a totally
  meaningless number when relating to performance of a CPU.
- A MHz rating is only meaningful across the same vendor/family of CPUs.
Getting cpufreq's policy interface into something CPU agnostic therefore
precludes MHz ratings AFAICS.
