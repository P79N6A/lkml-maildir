I have 2 features which someone might be able to help me with - They
have been around for a while, but I haven't had a chance to report
them... They could be related to my hardware:
Dual P-II 400, 256Mb RAM, 2xWD9100 HDDs, Soundblaster AWE32
Linux 2.1.xxx kernel based on RH 5.2 install
1) Strange hdparm results: Any explanations welcome - Both disks are
identical, seem to perform reasonably, and hang off 2 channels of an
aic7xxx Ultra-Wide SCSI controller, but running hdparam gives:
    [root@one47]# /sbin/hdparm -tT /dev/sda /dev/sdb
    /dev/sda:
     Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.20 seconds =106.67 MB/sec
     Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 25.62 seconds = 2.50 MB/sec
                                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^
--- Ouch !!!
    /dev/sdb:
     Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.18 seconds =108.47 MB/sec
     Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.00 seconds =12.80 MB/sec
These results are consistent !
2) A sound problem, easily demonstrated using... You geussed it... Quake
II.
When Q2 is run for the first time all is fine... Sound is OK, and life
is good. Subsequent times though I get the following message and core
dump:
    Added packfile ./baseq2/pak0.pak (3307 files)
    Added packfile ./baseq2/pak1.pak (279 files)
    Added packfile ./baseq2/pak2.pak (2 files)
    Added packfile ./baseq2/pak3.pak (8 files)
    execing default.cfg
    execing config.cfg
    Console initialized.
    ------- sound initialization -------
    sound sampling rate: 11025
    Segmentation fault      (core dumped)
Doing a "file core" suggests that the reason for the dump is a Sig 11.
Note that this always runs OK 1st thing after a boot, but never for a
2nd or subsequent attempt...
