I believe the modern way would be to use splice() system call :
loop
 splice(from disk , to pipe) with SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK
 wait_event_from_epoll (pipe ready for reading)
 splice(from pipe, to socket)
 wait_event_from_epoll (socket ready for writing)
But :
1) I am not sure epoll can get an event when page(s) is/are ready in pipe (ie disk delivered the page(s) to cache)
2) I am not sure splice() to socket is actually implemented with 0-copy
3) I am not sure pipe capacity (16 pages) would be enough to get a good readahead.
