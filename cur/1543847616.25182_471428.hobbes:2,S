Hello sam, thanks for replying,
I have another doubt in the same,
generally when we compile any external kernel module which uses some
kernel symbol, there we don't see any such warnings even though we are
compiling our module separately?  So compiling a dependent module
separately is similar to compiling a external kernel module.
Why such warninigs are being observed here in dependent module while compiling?
