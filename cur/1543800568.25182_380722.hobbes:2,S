This is totally not relevant.
99% of all bug-reports happen for non-developers. What developers can and 
can not do from a debuggability standpoint is almost totally 
uninteresting: quite often the developers won't even be able to recreate 
the bug, but have to go on the bug report that comes in from the outside.
And yes, some users are willing to recompile the kernel, and try ten 
different versions, and in general are just worth their weight in gold. 
But many people have trouble even reporting the (short) oops details, much 
less follow up on it. 
So it's actually important that the default config is reasonably easy to 
debug from the oops report. Because it may be the only thing you ever get.
So -O0 and -fno-inline simply isn't practical, because they are not an 
option for a normal kernel.
