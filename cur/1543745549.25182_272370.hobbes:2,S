I think it's fair to say you have 4G of virtual address space per process, 
but try to store 4G of information per process in it, and you will 
probably find you can't.  What's essentially scarce is swap space. Killing 
off processes frees up swap space.
It was probably wrong of me to say the OOM can't free up real memory, 
because where real memory backs virtual memory, the only way to free up 
the real memory is to page out the virtual memory or destroy it, and the 
OOM killer destroys it.
But still -- if the real memory shortage isn't because there's no place to 
page out to, but rather that the process that's supposed to be writing the 
pages is deadlocked, the OOM killer will not kick in.
