That would say to me that READA is not hooked up correctly. i.e:
#define READ 0
#define WRITE 1
#define READA 2         /* read-ahead  - don't block if no resources */
#define SWRITE 3        /* for ll_rw_block() - wait for buffer lock */
#define READ_SYNC       (READ | (1 << BIO_RW_SYNC))
#define READ_META       (READ | (1 << BIO_RW_META))
#define WRITE_SYNC      (WRITE | (1 << BIO_RW_SYNC))
#define WRITE_BARRIER   ((1 << BIO_RW) | (1 << BIO_RW_BARRIER))
i.e. it should be:
#define READA		(1 << BIO_RW_AHEAD)
Right?
FWIW, dm does this:
		if (bio_rw(bio) != READA)
Which really should be if (bio_rw_ahead(bio)).....
Cheers,
Dave.
