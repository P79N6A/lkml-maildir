> Well, it was quick enough to just do - here's the patch. I've
> also updated the documentation a bit to clarify the intention and

>  comments to the original change that made highmem uncountable for
>  dirtyness purposes)
>  Tested and applied against 2.6.23.9 (our build script makes Debian
>  packages from a clean unpack of kernel major plus patch minor plus
>  svn checkout of out quilt series and apply regardless, so it was
>  just as easy to bump the version number while I was at it).
>  Builds, boots, passes a quick run of the test program I used last

Thanks Bron! I can use vmware again!
