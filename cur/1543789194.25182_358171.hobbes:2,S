Yes 2.6.14-rc4-rt5 compiles and runs on x86_64 smp with latency tracing
enabled :-)
I enabled DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW too to see what was happening during boot.
Boot messages are so verbose (>100kB) they had to be captured with
serial console. Here's a snip showing the last stack size measurement:
----------------------------->
| new stack-footprint maximum: hotplug/875, 4784 bytes (out of 8112 bytes).
------------|
There are also a *lot* of chunks of output ending with lines like these:
<snip>
{  128} [<ffffffff80178213>] do_no_page+0x443/0x730
{  112} [<ffffffff8017a070>] __handle_mm_fault+0x1a0/0x540
{  272} [<ffffffff802d72cd>] do_page_fault+0x4dd/0x89c
{=3352} [<ffffffff8010ef11>] error_exit+0x0/0x81
<---------------------------
</snip>
Don't know if that's normal. I can send you the full boot message
if required.
