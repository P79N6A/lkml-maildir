I was waiting for discussion on the other thread. But yes, this does
simplify the code by copying in the common code in get_sb_single() and
get_sb_nodev() into devpts, and eliminating the do_remount() stuff in
'single-mount' mode.
We may also be able to define an "empty" mknod_ptmx() when
CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES=n and share a bit more code, but will
defer that to a separate patch.
Will test this out some more and resend the modified patch.
