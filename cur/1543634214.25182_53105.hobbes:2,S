Yes, sorry.

Well, I'm heading away from assumptions on the arch representations of
online CPUs (which the NUMA guys need anyway).
You could do a loop here, but the real problem is the broken userspace
interface.  Can you fix this so it takes a single CPU number please?
ie.
	/* -1 = remove affinity */
	sys_sched_setaffinity(pid_t pid, int cpu);
This will work everywhere, and doesn't require userspace to know the
size of the cpu bitmask etc.
Rusty.
