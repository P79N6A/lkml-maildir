Indeed, I compiled ext3 support in the kernel. I so tried to recompile the
kernel 2.2.12 with ext3 as module as I preferred not seeing negative
messages and got the followning:
kernel/kernel.o(__ksymtab+0x4d0): undefined reference to
`jfs_prelock_buffer_check'
kernel/kernel.o(__ksymtab+0x4d8): undefined reference to
`jfs_preclean_buffer_check'
fs/fs.o: In function `refile_buffer':
fs/fs.o(.text+0x3471): undefined reference to `journal_remove_checkpoint'
drivers/block/block.a(ll_rw_blk.o): In function `add_request':
ll_rw_blk.o(.text+0x4b9): undefined reference to
`jfs_preclean_buffer_check'

ll_rw_blk.o(.text+0xad6): undefined reference to

make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
I used 'make menuconfig'. There is a choice for module. The module support
hasn't been implemented yet ?
