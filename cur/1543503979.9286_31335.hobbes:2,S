>What's the story with update and kflushd?
The short answer: don't use 2.2.8, and run update.
The long answer:
2.2.x for all x != 8 require you to run update.  2.2.8 is badly broken
and should not be used.
All 2.3.x (except 2.3.0 which is identical to 2.2.8) require you to
run update.
Some of the 2.2.XacY kernels do not require you to run update, but
they kill it off automatically if you run it, so you don't have to
worry about it.  That change may be put into later 2.2.x/2.3.x
kernels; again, you will not have to worry about it if so.
Never mess with kflushd.
