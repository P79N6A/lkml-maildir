Actually lowest priority delivery works on P4 and AMD (I did not tested
it on AMD, though), if we _update_ TPR. But I don't recommend that,
instead we should implement the similar or optimized behavior in
software because "soft TPR" can be more efficient and scalable. And I
think this is something in my mind, and I think the kernel should do it.
