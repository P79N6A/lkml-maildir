	Are there PCI bridge cards that use all of those?  For
example, I thought that Triton was a series of Intel motherboard
chipsets for 586 processors.  Perhaps you only need to keep a
few of those routines.
	Jung-Ik: perhaps you could to an lspci and an "lspci -n" on
your machine when the bridge card is plugged in, which should provide
enough information to determine which routines you really need to
keep.

	I posted a patch to define __usbinit and cousins to the
linux-kernel mailing list about two and a half years ago.  The change
has been sitting in my <linux/init.h> since then.  I just did a string
replacement to make the matching pci calls.  Here an an untested patch
that shows both.
	I believe that, theoretically, all __dev{init,exit}{,func}
should only be __dev<bus>{init,exit}{,func}.
