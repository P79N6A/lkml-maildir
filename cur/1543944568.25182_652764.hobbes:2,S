I was wrong :-(
I'd not really done any real workkkk under 2.6.25 yet, but now while running 
a kernel compile with -j4 (single processor, dual core Pentium D), I see 
this behavior. The mouse cursor moves a bit jerky and I sometimes get key 
presses repeated.
While I'm typing this, the load lowers a bit and immediately things become 
smoother and the key repeats seem to vanish.
(The key repeats in the subject and para above are real examples of this, 
not typo's.)
The keyboard repeat issue looks like what was reported in [1], but for me 
this is very definitely an new issue that did not appear with 2.6.24 or 
earlier.
Cheers,
FJP
