The first step would be "find some way of identifying where all the time is
being spent".
Right now, netconsole gets disabled (or makes the machine hang) and most of
these machines don't have serial ports and the printk buffer gets lost
during resume.
The net result is that the machine takes a long time to suspend and resume,
and you don't have a clue *why*.
And this is a significant issue, IMO.  In terms of
niceness-of-user-interface, being able to suspend in twelve seconds instead
of twenty seven rates fairly highly...
