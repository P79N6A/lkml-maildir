I'm using 2.2.0 (non pre) with an es1370 (Sound Blaster PCI64).
This is NOT an important problem, I'm just not sure if it is known or not.
This problem has to do with the 'record' feature (I'm using Xmixer, so I'm
going to refer to this as the record/play button).
If synth (/dev/dsp1) is set for play, only the left channel works.  If set
for record, both do.  Same way with the line in.
If CD is set for play, neither channel works, if set for record, both
channels do.  Same is true for line1 and line2 (this is the 3 connectors
inside the machine)
Other than that, works great!
