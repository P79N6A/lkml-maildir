That does not help against the loadkeys issue if the attacking user is still
logged in on another virtual console. Even when tty1 is active, a user owning
tty6 can use loadkeys.
Plus, the Linux SAK does not reset the keyboard mapping. And SAK does not reset
the video mode, so when pressed on X, the terminal video mode is garbled until
reboot (maybe it works fine with some framebuffer drivers, but with the stock
VGA text console, it doesn't). X comes back up fine, but when pressing
Ctrl-Alt-F1, X will restore the video mode it saw on startup - which is the
mode of the previous X server the SAK has killed.

Well, sometimes you have problems that powercycling would "hide" so you can't
track them down if you powercycle the whole computer every time.

For using foreign languages and keyboard mappings.
But for that a suid wrapper around loadkeys would suffice - most distributions
include more than enough keyboard mapping files already.

If man console_codes is correct, they can't.
