Given that the definition of "derived work" in the software world is still
quite squishy and not firmed up, it's not at all clear that proprietary
modules are "blatantly" breaking the law.  In particular, feel free to
cite actual statute or case law that proves unequivocally that modules that
have a GPL shim that interface between the kernel and a binary blob are
breaking the law.
Hint: first you have to prove that the kernel API doesn't qualify as 'scenes
a faire' - a tough job when calling a function in any way but the one approved
one will cause an oops. ;)
