That's a pretty good argument _against_ adding another one :)  I wonder
how old those "temporary hacks" are (the ones you missed as well).
To make TRUE/FALSE go away, you or someone will have to visit them all,
which will take time.  Why add an intermediate step where you or others
can end up getting interrupted (indefinitely), leaving the "temporary"
definition lying around for folks to use?
