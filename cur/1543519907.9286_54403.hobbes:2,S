A had similar troubles with my alpha and 2.2. kernels until I replaced the
Adaptec SCSI card with an Intraserver card. Hasn't crashed since.
I think Doug Ledford is the person working on that driver. I don't have
the resources to help him debug the thing but if you are having lockups
and you have an Adaptec AIC7xxx card, try stopping X and running the machine
to lockup. I was seeing SCSI errors that went to the screen but no log. If
you get these messages, I think Doug would like to hear from you.
