Hi Ingo... I'm getting reports from some of my Planet CCRMA users (which
I confirmed) that the latest rt kernel I released has broken suspend
(tested on fc6 & fc7, stock Fedora kernel works fine - the rt
configuration files are virtual clones as far as possible of the
standard Fedora kernel config files). 
I don't know where to start debugging this. When suspend is initiated it
freezes with a "Stopping tasks ... " message in the text console - a
hard power cycle is the only way to get the machine back to normal. 
kernel/power/process.c seems to contain that string in the
freeze_processes function so it looks like the freezer is not freezing
tasks as no "done" message is ever printed. 
What could we do to help?
