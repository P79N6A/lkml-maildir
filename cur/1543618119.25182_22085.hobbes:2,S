I have working media change (and presense) detection for the ide-floppy
driver, that handles nearly every situation. It will be even better (and
handle all situations) when Andre's new IDE driver gets merged into 2.4.x
and I can use taskfile I/O to implement some more drive features.
The code is ready to be reviewed, I've asked Paul Bristow to do so but so
far haven't gotten any response.
