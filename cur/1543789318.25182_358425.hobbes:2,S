There's no config symbol for it because you can't disable it.  It's always 
hardwired in.  (Most of the code for ramfs is just the normal page cache 
stuff anyway.  It's a filesystem that uses the disk cache mechanism to store 
its data.  Quiet clever, really.)  Initramfs is called "rootfs" in the mount 
list, and is always there.  (Check proc/mounts on any 2.6 kernel.)  Getting 
rid of rootfs would cause an immediate deadlock becuase it's used as a search 
terminator in the doubly linked list of mounts inside the kernel.
And yes, moving off of initramfs is non-obvious because of this.  I talked 
about that a bit here:
http://www.busybox.net/lists/busybox/2005-October/016597.html
By default, the build creates an empty archive to initialize initramfs (this 
archive gets linked into the kernel image, it's not a separate file), and the 
boot process extracts it (a NOP) and then tries to exec /init in rootfs 
(which is empty, so this fails), and then falls through to the normal root 
partition finding behavior.

Then your system is setup to boot via initrd.  Probably your vendor has 
an /sbin/installkernel script that makes one.  (See arch/i386/boot/install.sh 
for details.  When you run "make install" that script looks for an 
"installkernel" script on the current system and runs it if it finds it, so 
that any vendor weirdness can apply to your new kernel automatically...)
