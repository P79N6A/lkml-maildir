more on this issue:
it seems to be not a kernel issue - I tried with 2.0.34 and 2.2.5
the results are exactly the same as long as util-linux2.9i is used.
The problem as I see it is:
fdisk tells me that it has written partition table and running it again
tells me that indeed it did but it really did *not*. This can be
dangerous, e.g. if I run mkswap *before* rebooting on one of the
partitions changed.
(And the re-read partition table ioctl always returns EBUSY if any of teh
partitions is in use).
Regards,
Tigran.
