As I said earlier, some architectures do not map the memory returned by
get_free_pages using 'page tables'.  x86 and ARM are two examples of
architectures that don't.  Therefore, you cannot set page specific bits
on these machines.
(x86 uses 4MB pages, ARM uses 1MB sections).

This may work, but you are suggesting a recursive call to get_free_pages.
IMHO, this is not an elegant solution.
