Reminded me of a patch I have had floating around for far too long time.

We could in theory create a new EXPORT_SYMBOL variant that does not
reference the symbol directly. This does a little less compile-time
checks but helps reduce the noise. The big advantage of this
would be that we could once again build kernels with -Werror on
developer machines.

------------------------
Obviously it does not apply today but it does not make sense
to warn about the old API symbol being exported.
Do you see something wrong in the approach Arnd used?
I just never came around to look at it.
