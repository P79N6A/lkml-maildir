It does, but 2.4 alpha hasn't quite worked for me (the latest matrix of
support for LINUX is below- and I haven't passed Michael Declerck's testing
yet). I'll be checking the latest alpha bits this week some time and I still
also need to finish the kernel thread work that will allow loop events to be
down OOB.

Linux Notes
2.0/2.1/2.3 support dropped. 2.0 support will be added back later, but
basically, it'll be 2.0/2.2/2.4 only support.
NOTE: SOME CHANGES ARE NOW REQUIRED IN A DEFAULT KERNEL BECAUSE WE NEED
NOTE: SOME EXTRA SYMBOLS EXPORTED. SEE LINUX_BUILD INSTRUCTIONS.
NOTE:	AT THIS TIME YOU MUST BOOT 2.4/i386 WITH nmi_watchdog=0
NOTE:	APPENDED TO THE BOOT COMMAND LINE.
NOTE:	TARGET MODE IS BROKEN IN LINUX RIGHT NOW
This release has been tested agains:
	Alpha		2.2.17		[1]
	IA-32		2.2.17		2.4.0-test11
	PowerPC		2.2.17		[2]
	Sparc64		2.2.17		2.4.0-test11
There are now patches agains 2.2.17 and 2.4.0-test11 in the linux subdirectory.
Or you can build as a module in place in the linux directory. See
LINUX_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.
[1] 2.4.0-test11 panic'd and crashed and burned in readw for me. I think
that this is a known alpha arch problem at this time, so I'm going to wait
until  'they' fix it.
[2] I can't find a complable 2.4 for PPC at the time of test1.
