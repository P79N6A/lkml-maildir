I posted this workaround here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105760102522650&w=2
but as Adrian Bunk pointed out in a response, the problem is that
"changes to arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c got lost at the update of -ac to -pre3".
If you want to be slightly more adventurous than using my
workaround patch, you could copy the mpparse.c file from 2.4.21-ac4.
That was compile tested but not run tested.
