It is the same situation except that in the laptop case you don't care
that reconfiguring your network will take a second or a few.  For live
migration we're looking at network downtime from as low as 60ms to
something like 210ms on a busy virtual machine.  I'm not saying that
a userspace solution wouldn't work but it would probably add a measurable
delay to the network downtime during live migration.
