The default value of CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU is ON.
Then, almost machine use CONFIG_NUMA version lru_add_drain_all().
Therefore, this config option is not so valuable.
I like simple removing.
following patch can boot on UP machine.
===
Currently, lru_add_drain_all() has two version.
  (1) use schedule_on_each_cpu()
  (2) don't use schedule_on_each_cpu()
Gerald Schaefer reported it doesn't works well on SMP (not NUMA) S390 machine.
  offline_pages() calls lru_add_drain_all() followed by drain_all_pages().
  While drain_all_pages() works on each cpu, lru_add_drain_all() only runs
  on the current cpu for architectures w/o CONFIG_NUMA. This let us run
  into the BUG_ON(!PageBuddy(page)) in __offline_isolated_pages() during
  memory hotplug stress test on s390. The page in question was still on the
  pcp list, because of a race with lru_add_drain_all() and drain_all_pages()
  on different cpus.
Actually, Almost machine has CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU=y. Then almost machine use
(1) version lru_add_drain_all although the machine is UP.
Then this ifdef is not valueable.
simple removing is better.
