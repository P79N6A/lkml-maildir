Subject: Re: [linux-cifs-client] [PATCH] cifs: wrap cifs_dnotify_thread in  CONFIG_BROKEN
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The thread may be renamed/rewritten etc. - but we badly need to finish
the dnotify / inotify code ... removing the start on this that someone
wrote in the past isn't getting us any closer to this.
dnotify/inotify support was added to Linux in the first place because
Samba used it to handle this common operation (it is commonly used by
OTHER cifs clients) ... but none of the Linux cluster/network file
systems have had time to finish the code ... we need to finish this -
the network protocol portion of this is now well documented (and we
presumably will need a thread to process the dnotify multishot
notification responses so we don't clog up the demultiplex thread
waiting on kde and gnoe)
