My SPARC here (linux-2.2.4, egcs-1.1.2) froze overnight: Responded to ping,
"telnet pincoya smtp" opened the connection (no response from sendmail at
all) and hang. No ctrl-alt-Fx. Just stop-A got it out. The screen had been
turned off, so I didn't get to see anything. Nothing made it to the logs
(truncated at a login attempt, possibly much earlier), but the log file
itself showed up with inconsistencies on reboot.
