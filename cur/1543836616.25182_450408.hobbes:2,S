It's been in the stable release of every kernel for quite some time now.
And it's enabled by default in FC5 and maybe RHEL4, I can't remember 100%
about the latter. And I'm not 100% sure what all GRSecurity does, but from
what I remember it covers a different area than SELinux so they're not
comparable.
The main reason it's not enabled by default in most distributions is that
writing good policies is a huge amount of work and they haven't written
policies for all of their packages. Now that SELinux has been pushed into
FC it'll act as motivation for people to get working on those policies so I
would guess that we'll see SELinux be enabled in the rest of the major
distributions by default in their next releases or so.

To varying extents everything is still under research. AFAIK the core of
SELinux hasn't changed in many years, it's just taken this long for people
to figure out how to apply it properly.

Sure if you can break into sshd you might be able to mess with it's config
files and any other areas on the system that everyone has access too, but
that's it. But if you just login via ssh you'll only have access to the
files that your account has access to, not sshd.

Precisely what? What's defined in POSIX ACLs wouldn't apply well to
processes anyway since they were designed for file access. SELinux was
created to deal with what you're talking about, why not use it?
