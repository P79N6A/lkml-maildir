Unfortunately, fairness is rather non-formal in this context and probably
isn't strictly desirable given how hack much of Linux userspace is. Until
there's a method of doing directed yields, like what Will has prescribed
a kind of allotment to thread doing work for another a completely strict
mechanism, it is probably problematic with regards to corner cases.
X for example is largely non-thread safe. Until they can get their xcb
framework in place and addition thread infrastructure to do hand off
properly, it's going to be difficult schedule for it. It's well known to
be problematic.
You announced your scheduler without CCing any of the relevant people here
(and risk being completely ignored in lkml traffic):

What is your opinion of both CFS and SDL ? How can you work be useful
to either scheduler mentioned or to the Linux kernel on its own ?

Will has been thinking about this, but you have to also consider the
practicalities of your approach versus Con's and Ingo's.
I'm all for things like proportional scheduling and the extensions
needed to do it properly. It would be highly relevant to some version
of the -rt patch if not that patch directly.
