You don't have disconnect per se with Fibre (or with other packet based
interfaces).  A command is sent as a frame.  If the frame is corrupted
or lost on the way to the target, then the target will never know about
the command having been sent.  There are obvious problems if that command
has an ordered tag, preceded and followed by simple tags dependent on
the ordered semantics being followed, and where the simple tagged commands
following don't wait for the ordered tag to finish.  There are other
failure modes too, of course.

I guess it all depends on how sensitive one is to getting it wrong.  In
any case, it looks as though you are doing what you can . . . .
