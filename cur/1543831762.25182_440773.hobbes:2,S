Do you consider that the drawback of the patch is in that the value
MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS is not well known high or this limit is not deleted
at all? The limit could be deleted after patching because the line 
+	if (writeback_in_progress(bdi)) {
keeps off creating extra pdflush threads.

I specifically mentioned that multiple deviceS become congested: each
pdlush thread stuck on its own congested device, the rest of devices is
idle.

It also was the last file system that supported the only type of file
system, with asumptions about file system behaviour hard coded into its
design. :-)
