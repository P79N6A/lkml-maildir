BUG trap. Turn on verbose bug reporting, also run the  oops you then
get through ksymoops so that its actually readable by others. List what
scsi controller you use too.
The RH tree I'm running backed out a couple of scsi error handling changes
because we saw strange deadlocks. I don't think those are in Marcelo's tree
because I never had time to work out why they had to be reverted
