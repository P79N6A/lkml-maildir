Subject: [2.6.24 patch] let EXT4DEV_FS depend on BROKEN
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It might make sense to offer ext4 in -mm and even in early -rc kernels, 
but I've already seen people using ext4 simply because a stable kernel 
offered it - and that's definitely not intended.
Anyone who _really_ wants to test ext4 should anyway be able to do the 
trivial change of removing the "depends on BROKEN" line.
