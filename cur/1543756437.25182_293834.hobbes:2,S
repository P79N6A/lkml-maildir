	You are right, it's not critical, and I was already thinking
of not pushing WE-18 to you (the WPA update). I'll stop updating 2.4.X
with respect to wireless, the patches will be available on my web page
for people who needs it. We may revisit this if there is a public
outcry...

	There need to be some unique features in 2.6.X to force people
to upgrade, I guess...

	Thanks.
