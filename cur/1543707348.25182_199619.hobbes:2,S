Now I compiled 2.6.3-mm1 with new radeonfb. Clean boot without radeonfb append
sets 640x480 in 60 Hz, ok thats fine.
But..,
if I use fbset like this:
	fbset -fb /dev/fb0 -a -depth 32 1024x768-100
my CRT monitor MAG 786FD looks like ths:
|------------|
|     |      |
|  a  |      |
|     |      |
|-----|      |
|       b    |
|            |
|------------|
Where "a" is the visual screan after using fbset and "b" is my monitor.
So something is worng, besides when using higher resolution "a" fieald is
smaller then "b".
P.S. Using video=radeon:1024x768-32@100 in append is _NOT_ working for my
rv250if (radeon 9000 pro).
PP.S. Cursor is working fine on text terminal, but in graphics it's hangs when
protocol option is set to auto :-) Using "IMPS/2" works, but xterm is not
starting :-)
PPP.S. Ben please if you know tell me if fglrx works with new radeonfb without
hanging text terminal as it was in old radeonfb.
