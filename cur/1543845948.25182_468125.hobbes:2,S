Hi Andi,
[resending with proper CC's].
Please apply this Calgary patchset. It fixes one bug
(
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=203971,
 should
go to -stable as well) and makes several other updates all of which
are safe for 2.6.19. Each patch has a detailed description.
Thanks,
Muli
