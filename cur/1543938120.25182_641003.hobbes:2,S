I believe that all throttling does is forcibly halt the CPU on a 
particular duty cycle. This will reduce the rate of power consumption, 
but reduces the CPU performance by a greater amount (since even at 100% 
halted the CPU still consumes power) and so actually reduces performance 
per watt. It will spread the heat and power usage produced from a given 
workload task out in time (thus its usefulness in limiting CPU 
temperature) but will consume more power overall.
Real CPU clock throttling schemes like SpeedStep, PowerNow, etc. 
actually do increase performance per watt when they kick in.
