The text appears with lines through it, and I'm then typing blindly. I can still type commands though.
I'm not sure whether it is radeonfb or XFree driver bug. On my system after
I switch from X to console, all "clear rectangle" requests are wrong, like if
line length in hardware was stil 1664*4 (what X do) instead of 1600*1 (what
console wants).
Second problem is that XFree driver (from 4.2.1.1 in Debian unstable) does not
like usefbdev on. It uses fbdev, but somehow it thinks that line length is 1664*4
although fbdev reports that it set 1600*4, and display also looks like that 1600 was
programmed into hardware.
And when console uses 16bpp, after switching from X picture is zoomed by 200%
(giving 800x600).  When console uses 32bpp, it is zoomed by 400% after
switch from X to console. In both cases rerunning fbset fixes problem.
I'm using Compaq Evo 800N, with 1600x1200 DFP.
