Subject: [PATCH] VESA FrameBuffer memory size

I've had problems with my Dell Inspiron laptop w/ VESA framebuffers in ywrap
mode.  After some poking around I've discovered that the VESA implementation on
my laptop underreports its memory size by 64k.  I couldn't find any reason for
this in the VESA spec, so there was no way to directly fix the problem.  What I
did do however is add a mem= parameter to the vesafb command line.  I mentioned
this back in the 2.3.1 days but still haven't seen this code make its way into
the tree.  Below is the patch against a 2.4.0-test6 kernel.  Any chance of me
getting this in, its getting to be a real PITA to have to patch every release.
