Rats. Sorry. I remember now. That's not the first time I am hit by
that one. I had even made a resolution to try and find out the correct
options to set. So what are they? CONFIG_RTC=y and CONFIG_RTC_DRV_CMOS=n?
Guess I should try that combination in my next round of tests.
Anyway, shouldn't there be a warning or at least some clear instructions?
As it is, both the old and the new driver claim in Kconfig that you need
them in order to access your RTC, and none of them even mentions the
other, so it's way too easy to end up enabling both of them.
So are all my other woes a consequence of that one?
Thanks,
T.
