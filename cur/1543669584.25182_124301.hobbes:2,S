How long will it be before somebody develops an ATAPI, SCSI host
adaptor, I.E. a SCSI host adaptor which appears as an ATAPI device?
(I know that ATAPI really is effectively just a SCSI transport, but
you can already get SCSI, SCSI host adaptors, I.E. where the devices
on the second-level adaptor appear as the logical units of the host
adaptor, and there is no reason this couldn't be done using ATAPI).
John.
