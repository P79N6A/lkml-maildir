Subject: Multicast tunneling in 2.4

I am trying to set up a tunnel from my linux machine to the MBone.
My kernel (2.4.2) supports multicasting and advanced routing:
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST=y
CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER=y
CONFIG_IP_MROUTE=y
I have read 
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Multicast-HOWTO.html
and  
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html.
Unfortunately, Section 7 of the Advanced Routing HOWTO
(Multicast routing) says:
  "FIXME: Editor Vacancy! (somebody is working on it, though)"
Suppose I know the IP address of a nearby multicast router and would
like to set up a tunnel from my machine to that router (a tunnel to
the MBone), so that I may receive multicast datagrams in spite of the
fact that intervening routers are ignorant of multicast routing
protocols.  Is this possible with the 2.4.2 kernel?  I cannot find
documentation to this effect, but the existence of <linux/mroute.h>
(which contains some structs previously defined in mrouted) makes me
think that it is possible.
