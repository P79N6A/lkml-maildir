One may either demote to evict MAX_RT_PRIO immediately prior to
rotation or rely on timeslice expiry to evict MAX_RT_PRIO. Forcibly
evicting MAX_RT_PRIO undesirably accumulates tasks at the fencepost.

This is an alternative to scheduler accounting in context switches.
Periodicity often loses power conservation benefits.
