[Well, unless my motherboard really has a problem caching memory above
1GB.  But that seems unlikely, since it's the CPU which is acting as
the memory controller.  In any event, if this is actually the issue,
shouldn't the kernel issue a warning message, about why it's ignoring
the rest of the memory?]
