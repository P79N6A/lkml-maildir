Thanks for fixing this up - the only recommended option missing in
pine is quell-flowed-text. Will set it up and see how that goes.

I did not see any failures on my desktop at least - being a newer
Intel board (P35) it does not seem to require any quirks - for those
HP desktops which do require quirks it sounds plausible that some may
be missed without the patch. dmesg diff does not look significantly
different apart from the obviously absent DMI OOM messages and time.c
/ apic timer calibration differences along with same but differently
placed lines - not sure why that happens, may not be related to this
patch I think.

Google doesn't reveal anyone apart from HP Desktop owners [*] with
large empty OEM strings as having this problem - and with this patch
the existing 2K is underutilized - less than 500 bytes on my desktop.
So I think we can defer the increase until someone actually needs that
much DMI space for valid purposes.
Thanks
