Stephen,
FUA is also available on WRITE16. The same FUA support pattern
applies to the READ6,10,12 and 16 series. Interestingly if a
WRITE10 is called with FUA==0 followed by a READ10 with FUA=1
on the same block(s) then the READ causes the a flush from the
cache to the platter (if it hasn't already been done). [It
would be pretty ugly otherwise :-)]
Also SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(10) allows a range of blocks to be sent
to the platter but the size of the range is limited to 2**16 - 1
blocks which is probably too small to be useful. If the
"number of blocks" field is set to 0 then the whole disk cache
is flushed to the platter. There is a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(16)
defined in recent sbc2 drafts that allows a 32 bit range
but it is unlikely to appear on any disk any time soon. There
is also an "Immed"-iate bit on these sync_cache commands
that may be of interest. When set this bit instructs the
target to respond with a good status immediately on receipt
of the command (and thus before the dirty blocks of the disk 
cache are flushed to the platter).
