Denis:
Mmm, sorry.  I was in the habit of using a button on kmail that 
replies only to the mailing list, thinking that then I wasn't 
bombarding everyone with 2 or more copies of my replies.  I've now 
re-arranged it so that I have a "reply all" button, and will use that 
one from now on unless the subject is really OT.
Linus:
One comment re the patch, I'm seeing a huge slowdown in the seti 
processing, its only done about 2.5 units since 6am local, and it 
should be well into the 4th by now.
Anybody:
Speaking of somewhat OT, what is the command I should use to actually 
turn on the PREEMPT option in the kernel?  Its on in the compile, but 
I think I read someplace where I had to do an "echo 1 >someplace 
in /proc" to actually enable it.  I've survived over 24 hours now 
with the patch Linus sent, and I thought maybe I'd get some exersize 
pushing my luck :)
