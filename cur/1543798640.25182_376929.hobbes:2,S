Forward declarations of typedefs don't work in at least one case that
do for struct definitions:
$ cat foo.c
typedef struct foo foo_t;
typedef struct foo foo_t;
$ gcc -Wall -o foo.o -c foo.c
foo.c:2: error: redefinition of typedef 'foo_t'
foo.c:1: error: previous declaration of 'foo_t' was here
and if you don't believe we do that, take another look at our headers
sometime.
