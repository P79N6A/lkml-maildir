I'm a little less worried about OSDL advocating binary drivers.  I
*am* more worried about how the message goes out, how the information
becomes visible to the right people, etc.  I think OSDL can help there;
the project managers, product marking people, senior manager's etc. at
these various companies have business models that assume Linux is
"just like everything else" and these people don't go rooting around
in linux/Documentation looking for the answers to their business model.
OSDL can help here since more business folks talk to OSDL.
And, by calling attention to those items which do and do not have source
drivers available along with the education on business reasons for
avoiding binary drivers might help get the message through to more of
the right people.
Ideally, any OSDL effort would also be reviewed and contributed to by
the development community to keep it focused in the right directions.
