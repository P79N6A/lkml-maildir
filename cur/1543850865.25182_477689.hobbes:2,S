It looks like this patch got merged in to only warn about partitions 
going beyond the end of the device.  What still concerns me is that I ( 
and others ) get a lot of IO error kernel messages during boot because 
we boot from a raid0 and the first disk in the set appears to contain a 
valid partition table that lists partitions larger than the single disk 
( since the partitions span both disks ).  This causes the kernel to 
complain when it probes the partitions as it tries to read beyond the 
end of the device.
The arguments in this thread for not discarding such partitions out of 
hand make sense to me, but I wonder: why does the kernel complain about 
IO errors to the disk when it KNOWS it is making an invalid request ( to 
sectors beyond the end of the device )?  Attempting the IO anyhow makes 
sense in a way if sometimes the kernel can detect the size wrongly, but 
if the IO fails, maybe the error message should be suppressed if it is 
beyond the detected end of device?
