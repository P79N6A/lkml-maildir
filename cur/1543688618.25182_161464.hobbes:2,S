The Kconfig files on these architectures had the interesting "feature" 
that both KCORE_AOUT and KCORE_ELF were enabled unconditionally...
Besides, I always consider the defconfig files as some kinds of 
generated files and since they only give default answers for
"make defconfig" I didn't see the big need for manually editing every 
single defconfig file.
