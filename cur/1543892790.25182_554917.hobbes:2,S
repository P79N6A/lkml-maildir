0.04 already has checks for reporting the foo ** bar style cast format
where there are two or more '*'s:
"foo ** bar" should be "foo **bar"
#12: FILE: Z4.c:9:
+       struct i5000_error_info ** foo;
The declaration forms (just for a single *) are unfortunately ambiguous,
it is hard to tell them from the foo * foo multiply form, for example if
we relax this test to include one '*':
"foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#19: FILE: Z4.c:16:
+       int a = this * info;
[/me pokes at it for a bit.]
Ok so the key here is that we should only be applying these foo* bar
checks to types.  What we can do is cook up a match for the standard
type forms, char, short ..., struct foo etc and use that to disambiguate
the single '*' form:
"foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#10: FILE: Z4.c:7:
+       struct i5000_error_info * foo;
We will miss those which are not obviously types, basically typedefs but
as we already are hot against those we should be pretty close to 100%
coverage.
