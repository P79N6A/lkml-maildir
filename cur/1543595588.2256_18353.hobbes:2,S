Hum - is there no simple way to determine whether a pointer is
a valid pointer to something returned by __get_free_pages ()? You are
right, S390 in particular seems to allow arbitrary addresses starting from
0.

For some reason I was convinced that this was the originally intended
use of start. The only quotes I find right now are Ori Pomerantz'
Module Programming Guide (
http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/lkmpg/node16.html
)
and Rubini's "Writing Device Drivers", chapter 4. Also, the comment in the
code
		if (!start) {
			/*
			 * For proc files that are less than 4k
			 */
		...
		}
supports this notion somehow (start only set if data size > page size).
After all, unless you want to mangle the file position as intended by
the hack, there is no point in touching start at all in proc_read (),
ppos will be updated automatically.
Perhaps I have misunderstood something here.
Who wrote the original code, after all?
