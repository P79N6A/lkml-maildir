Subject: [PATCH 03/15] aic94xx: Delete ascb timers when freeing queues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/17/283

When the aic94xx driver creates ascbs, each ascb is initialized with a
timeout timer.  If there are any ascbs left over when the driver is being
torn down, these timers need to be deleted.  In particular, we seem to
hit this case when ascbs are issued yet never end up on the done list.
Right now there's a sequencer bug that results in this happening every
so often.  CONTROL PHY commands also use these per-ascb timers.
We also want to print a warning if there are leftover ascbs that are
not for CONTROL PHY commands.
