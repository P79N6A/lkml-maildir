From POSIX.1, 3.1.2.2 (description of the exec* functions):
    The new process image also inherits the following attributes from
    the calling process image:
    [...]
    (12) Process signal mask (see 3.3.5)
    (13) Pending signals (see 3.3.6)
    [...]
So either part of your patch contravenes POSIX, I'm afraid.
