You'd use two kernels. There is no sane other answer to that specific

The code size differential is noise except for FPU emulation, and thats
in part sloppy because we could have __fpuseg and eject it at boot if
not needed ;)
386 kernels are slow because of user space handling and lack of bswap
486 kernels basically work on anything just fine

Right now its ordered
386 - 486 - 586 - 586+TSC - 686 - PPro - PII - PIII - PIV
Geode is a branch off 586+TSC and supports 686+ too
Athlon branches off from PIII if I remember rightly
Winchip branches off from 586 and supports all later x86 too
ELAN is its own weird world
Xmeta comes off 686 somewhere depending how you handle PGE
