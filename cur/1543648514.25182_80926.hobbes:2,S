Yes, definitely. There are lots of incredibly stupid admins out
there. There are some smart, some really smart, some smart-asses and
some paranoids but 99% of the people that call themselves "admins" are
unbelievably stupid. No matter how many different three-to-five letter
acronyms trail their names.
This is true for every OS out there. Look at the mess that the NT
rights management created... :-)
