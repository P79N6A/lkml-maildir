I was using the data to look up which task just got split away
from the parent. Judging by Chuck Ebbert's email, I'm not the
only person to expect the data to be valid.

That makes things even weirder. A successful execve done in one
thread appears to be done by another (which might not be
traced if the debugger was a bit odd), while a failing execve
appears... where?

I'm not sure utrace will be accepted. (many ptrace alternatives
have been born and died over the years) Even if utrace does get
accepted, initially we only get:
1. a clean-up that provides hope for the future
2. a hopefully-compatible ptrace on top of utrace
3. some sort of demo interface
That alone won't replace ptrace.

Never mind. I need to use vfork to ensure that the debugger
does not run until the child has done execve. Hopefully the
vfork wake-up won't happen before /proc/*/auxv is ready.
(doing a wait is awkward: I want the data before I enter my
main debugger loop, but the main debugger loop is based on
waitpid and will thus hang if the event is eaten early)

The process does indeed stop with a signal. It gets SIGTRAP
as part of sending the ptrace event.
