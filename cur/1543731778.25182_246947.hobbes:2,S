| Amen.  USB 2.0 orinoco wireless drivers seems to have problems when user space
| is set to 1GB.  Works grat with 2GB ad 3GB user space settings.  Problem occurs during

What kernel version?  I can't even find usb_read_device() in 2.6.9-rc1.
BTW, as someone else requested, please teach your mail client to wrap
lines around column 70-72.  Thanks.
