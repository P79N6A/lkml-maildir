This is notice that the do_try_to_free_pages bug is still present in the
latest 2.2 kernel, 2.2.18pre27.
VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for kjournald...
VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for kjournald...
VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for kjournald...
The error also occurs for other processes running on the system.  This was
a test with ext3.
The bug triggers when the system is really hammered (high system, network,
and disk load), and requires a reboot to recover.
