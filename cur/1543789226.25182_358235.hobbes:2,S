don't.
interruptible_sleep_on() is a broken interface (see the comments in the
header) and should not be used in any new code (where "new" is "since
the year 2000" :)
Just use the wait_event() interfaces .... or just a simple semaphore
even if what you want to do is simple and performance isn't too
critical.
