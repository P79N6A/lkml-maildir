I'm almost positive this wouldn't be the cause of your problems (even a
slow disk could read all these blocks in, randomly, in under 2 seconds,
assuming they're spread from one end of the platters to the other).
The problem is simply the more general one of parts your working set
being paged out (in this case, cached files). Which is something swap
prefetch will not help with.

I'd be stumped if swapoff helps you. Maybe you aren't exaggerating about
the speed of your swap.
