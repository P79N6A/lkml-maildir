I wrote a driver which steals a certain amount of memory from the kernel
and makes it available to userspace (somewhat like the rd driver).
If you want - I can send it to you.
It exports a small device hierarchy which can be read, written and
mmap'ed. The memory is contiguous. Not VERY elegant, but works quite
well.
The driver steals a certain amount of memory from the kernel at boot
time, a-la the mem= parameter. I have used "holes" of up to 1GB in size.
