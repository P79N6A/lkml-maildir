Problem solved.  I now know why the starvation logic doesn't work.
Wakeups.  In the face of 10+ copies of httpd constantly waking up, it
seems it just takes ages to get around to switching arrays.
With the (urp) patch below, I now get...
[root]:# time netstat|grep :81|wc -l
   1648
real    0m27.735s
user    0m0.158s
sys     0m0.111s
[root]:# time netstat|grep :81|wc -l
   1817
real    0m13.550s
user    0m0.121s
sys     0m0.186s
[root]:# time netstat|grep :81|wc -l
   1641
real    0m17.022s
user    0m0.132s
sys     0m0.143s
[root]:# 
which certainly isn't pleasant, but it beats the heck out of minutes.
