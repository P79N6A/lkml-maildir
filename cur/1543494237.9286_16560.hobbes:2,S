Hi Steffen, (Moin, Moin),
read initrd.txt and ramdisk.txt in the Documentation section of the
kernel. It's already been done, like so many times with Linux.
I've done a initrd, which loads as one variant of installation the
software into several ramdisks. The secret is real-root-dev in the /proc
section. You can mail/phone me directly if I can help you.
I can pass you a boot diskette of LinuxWall directly, too.
Instead of scanning you can and should do the process semi-automagically,
like the most distributors do.
Regards
Frank
