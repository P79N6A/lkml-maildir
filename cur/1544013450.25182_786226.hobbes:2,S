Mostly so that the script doesn't need to know about the source
directory. That would be another argument, making it harder to use. 
At least my build scripts often run in a different environment. And
make always checks it anyways.
Also I wasn't sure how to change the filename of the config file
without using Kconfig internals.  That would be less of a concern
now if it was merged, but it was one out of tree.

You don't need the make oldconfig, make always does that automatically.
BTW there's an undocumented option to do this, but I intentionally
didn't document it because it doesn't work with --file due to the
reasons stated above.
