Which would be a platform bus, rather like the runway bus in parisc

But the point is that the Altix does something non-standard but which
was later standardised (in a different way) largely so others could also
benefit from the relaxed ordering speedup.
I agree the altix needs something, what I don't agree is that we should
be overloading the dma data direction to do it ... especially given the
confetti like shower of other bus attributes waiting in the wings.
What it wants to do is set strict ordering for the bus ... well, that is
an attribute in the PCIe standard (it just happens to be the default one
for a standard bus, whereas relaxed is the default for altix).  However,
set bus attribute strict would be a simple no-op for a standard bus (and
set attribute relaxed a no-op for altix).
