Argh...  OK, now I remember why I went for -EBUSY for unlink() (we obviously
are not bound by SuS on that one).  Consider the following scenario:
	* local file foo got something else bound on it for a while
	* we are tight on space - time to clean up
	* oh, look - contents of foo is junk
	* rm foo
	* ... oh, fuck, there goes the underlying file.
