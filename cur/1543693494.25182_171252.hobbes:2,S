Hello Marcel,

Yes, we know. When I looked at it the last time, there were some 
problems that kept us from actually finishing the work.
(If you did not use a hotplug agent, then the system was frozen, because 
the firmware foo did not use it's own workqueue)
I gave some feedback, but I don't know if the fixes made it into the 
kernel yet.
I have once patched our drivers to use request_firmware() and I have 
these patches still lying around, so I'll try and see if they work when 
I have some spare time.
