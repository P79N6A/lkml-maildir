I will be giving a presentation on User-mode Linux to the Cleveland 
Linux User Group as part of their December meeting. As well as covering 
the general aspects of UML, I will be looking at UML as a virtual 
hosting platform, based upon my own experiences of User-mode Linux, 
which I have documented at 
http://uml.openconsultancy.com/.
 This will 
also include a demonstration of UML for networking and kernel debugging, 
along with a look at UMLd and some of the more interesting capabilities 
of UML.
The presentation will be held at the Parma Regional Library, Parma, Ohio 
on December 14th, from 9:30am to 11:45am. Everyone is welcome to attend, 
from Linux beginners and those yet to try Linux out, to those who 
contribute to the Linux kernel.
Slides, with their notes, along with documentation will be available on
the Internet following the meeting in PDF format.
More information on the meeting, including a map to the location, is 
available at 
http://cleveland.lug.net/meetings.html.

Cleveland LUG is at
