Tobias, can you confirm that calling pci_enable_device before reading
dev->irq fixes the 3c59x.c problem for you?
It sounds like the 2.4 kernel can now support "plug-n-play OS" BIOS
setting, AFAICS.
If moving pci_enable_device above any dev->irq checks solves Tobias'
problem, we need to go through the PCI drivers and make sure we check
things in the correct order in all PCI drivers.  I wonder if we
shouldn't move pci_resource_xxx calls until after pci_enable_device too.
A caveat to this whole scheme is that usb-uhci -already- calls
pci_enable_device before checking dev->irq, and yet cannot get around
the "assign IRQ to USB: no" setting in BIOS.  I hope that is an
exception rather than the rule.
Regards,
	Jeff
