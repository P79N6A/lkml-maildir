  I'm inclined to even accept very small patches that aren't really
bugfixes, like initmem poisoning and the signal delivery patch
that removes unconditional writes to dr7.
  But some of the larger ones scare me, especially when they need
modification to apply cleanly.  Even if the mods are clear, there
can be new logic elsewhere that breaks a backported patch.
