I've recently changed the code to make it *not* call unmap_kiobuf/vfree
from irq context.  Instead bttv 0.8.x doesn't allow you to close the
device with DMA xfers in flight.  If you try this the release() fops
handler will block until the transfer is done, then unmap_kiobuf from
process context, then return.
