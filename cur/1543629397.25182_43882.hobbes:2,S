Looking back a little earlier in the history of Unix,
we see that early versions ran on 16-bit
architectures. Does anyone out there remember Version
6 on the pdp11. It most certainly did not share the
address space (all 64k of it) between user and kernel.
Are you trying to say that what Dennis and Ken wrote
is not "Unix"?
