Yeah, if you can't get locking right, you can't get RCU right.  I've
shown you that using it in place of standard locking is simple: the
ONLY added issue is being careful not to screw readers while doing the
actual insert/delete.
Where, if anywhere, is this worth it?  Good question: 3% on 4-way
dbench doesn't cut it in my book...
Rusty.
