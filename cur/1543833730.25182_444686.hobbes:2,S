You won't know for sure... but. Let t be time takes to reload the
cache. Let your random noise be in <0, t> interval. According to you,
that would be okay. IT IS NOT.
If the original delay was long, and your generator returned t,
attacker sees 2*t. He can be _sure_ delay was long now.
If the delay was short, and your generator returns 0, attacker sees 0,
and _knows_ delay was short. (Chance that generator produces 0 or t is
small, but non zero).
Even if you do random noise in <0, 2*t) interval, I'll be able to
gather some statistics.

Thanks, Sharp!
