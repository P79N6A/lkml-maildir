Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
The compiler said
1.
kernel/power/disk.c(41): remark #593: variable "error" was set but never 
used
The source code is
    int error = 0;
2.
kernel/power/disk.c(165): remark #593: variable "error" was set but never 
used
The source code is
    int error;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variables.
Regards
David Binderman
