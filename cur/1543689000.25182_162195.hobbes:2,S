No, that ends up doing the wrong thing for most of the really common cases.
In particular, most of the memory allocation functions very seldom actually
sleep. After all, they'll find plenty of free memory (or easily freeable
memory) without having to wait for any pageouts or anything like that.
Yet the bug is there - the call _could_ have slept.
So "might_sleep()" really does what the name suggests: it is used to say
that a particular case _may_ sleep, even if it ends up being unlikely.
Because what we're after is not a bug actually happening, but a latent bug
that has been hidden by the fact that it happens so rarely in practice.
This is why "might_sleep()" should happen as early as possible, and not
get pushed down.
