Calgary and swiotlb can use it to gracefully handle out of memory when
they allocate their aperture (swiotlb) or translation tables (Calgary)
on initialization. Either can fall back to no-iommu if initialization
fails so there's really no need to panic.
Jon, you should probably resubmit this with your swiotlb patches
making use of it.
Cheers,
Muli
