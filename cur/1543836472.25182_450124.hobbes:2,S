We are not talking about VMX or AMDV.  Just plain ol' x86 hardware.

In this case native hardware == running on bare metal w/out VMX/AMDV
support and w/out any hypervisor.  So, while this would let you actually
boot the machine, it's probably not really useful for the case you cited
(security update to hypervisor causes ABI breakage) because you'd be
booting a normal kernel w/out any virtualization.  IOW, all the virtual
machines that were running on that physical machine would not be running.

This is non-trivial.  If the hv-interface breaks the ABI, then you'd
need to update the pv-glue layer in the kernel.

Thanks for helping.
