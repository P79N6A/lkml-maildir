Hi Dmitry,
Your patch (applied to 2.6.11.8) hangs my touchpad mouse totally.
The error i get on bootup
May  8 17:16:58 localhost kernel: ALPS Touchpad (Glidepoint) detected
May  8 17:16:58 localhost kernel: alps.c: Failed to enable absolute mode
May  8 17:16:58 localhost kernel: input: PS/2 ALPS TouchPad on 
isa0060/serio1
without your patch
May  8 18:11:56 localhost kernel: ALPS Touchpad (Dualpoint) detected
May  8 18:11:56 localhost kernel:   Disabling hardware tapping
May  8 18:11:56 localhost kernel: input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS TouchPad on 
isa0060/serio1
and the mouse works fine (except when it goes crazy and jumps all over 
the place). I've been suffering with the problem for a long while on 
this hardware..
Cheers
Mitch
