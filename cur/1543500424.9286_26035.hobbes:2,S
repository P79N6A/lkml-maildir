The figures so far are that I received three responses in Linux kernel
saying that for kassert not to evaluate its parameter would be a big
cause of bugs, and four further private responses making the same
point, against just your response saying otherwise. That's 7 to 1 in
favour of the evaluation - or 7 to 2 if one includes the fact that my
personal belief is that it shouldn't.

That's my opinion as well, which is why I had the undefined case not
evaluate it as submitted.

Done.

I'm not quite sure what you're referring to here...
 1. Allow different developers to set different REPORT_LEVEL values,
    such that (for example) the kassert() lines in the ISDN subsystem
    report failures as KERN_CRIT but those in the sound subsystem
    report failures as KERN_EMERG ???
    If this is what you intended to imply, then I would have to state
    that I consider such to be a BAD idea, and would need persuading
    that such was a reasonable course of action before I would begin
    to consider doing so.
 2. Allow a developer to specify the REPORT_LEVEL to be used across
    the kernel ???
    The current kernel allows this, since the setting of REPORT_LEVEL
    in kassert.h is used throughout.
 3. Some other meaning?
    Please clarify.

Personally, I'd like to see the configuration system redesigned such
that the main config.in file was in the main Linux directory, and it
included the relevant arch/*/*/config.in files in the relevant
sections of the main ones if they existed for that port. This would
result in something like the following syntax being added to ALL of
the configuration scripts:
	if [ -f $BASE/arch/i386/kernel/Config.in ]; then
		source $BASE/arch/i386/kernel/Config.in
	fi
...where the -f says "what follows exists and is either a regular file
or a symlink that resolves to a regular file", as per the bash script
standard, and $BASE expands to the absolute path of the base Linux
directory, probably /usr/src/linux on most systems.
Actually, I proposed a variant of that a while back which integrated
the configuration and help system together to ensure consistancy. This
variant would result in separate config.in and Configure.help files in
each directory containing options specific to that directory, and all
the responses were of the "go for it" variety.
The problem is that it was just a couple of days before my first exam
when I proposed it, and as a result, I never had time to look into it
myself. Also, ALL of the *config scripts would need to be updated in
parallel to do this, and, whilst I can probably handle the changes to
both configure and menuconfig, I couldn't even begin to sort out
xconfig at all...
Best wishes from Riley.
