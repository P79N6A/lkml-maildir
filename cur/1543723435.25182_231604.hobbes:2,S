Hi Wim,
I noticed you have been working on sanitizing the watchdog driver
in your 
http://linux-watchdog.bkbits.net/linux-2.6-watchdog-experimental
tree. What are your plans for this, i.e. do you see this as 2.7 only
stuff or do you intend to merge the at least the infrastructure code
so it can be used by future 2.6 drivers?
I'm asking because I have a new driver and I would prefer not to add
yet another copy of the ioctl code, which I don't even know how
to test properly.
If we can get your watchdog.c into a mergable state (in which it
arguably isn't at the moment), I could use that to base my driver
on, while the other drivers get converted during 2.7.
