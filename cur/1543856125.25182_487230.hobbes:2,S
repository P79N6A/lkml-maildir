if you have a Fedora 5/6-ish setup then you might be better off by 
trying my yum rpm kernels, via:
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   wget 
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/rt.repo
   yum install kernel-rt.x86_64
by the looks of it something changed in the .config that prevented your 
block device from being detected - and after that the kernel fell back 
to other methods of booting.
another thing, is your /etc/fstab using labels, or explicit devices? 
IIRC labels are needed i think by the new SATA/PATA code, a'ka:
  LABEL=/                 /                       ext3    noatime,nodiratime 1 1
