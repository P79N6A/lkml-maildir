Hello 
I want to write a script, which shows the name of the relevant kernel module for each listed pci device shown by 'lspci -m'. It's easy to find out the name of the corresponding module, if the driver has been compiled as a loadable kernel module: The file /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.pcimap lists module names based on pci device's vendor -and device id (shown by 'lspci -n'). But how can I find out the name of the corresponding kernel module if the module has been compiled directly into the kernel ? I thought that I can find them in the kernel's machting System.map based on vendor -and device id as well. But I can't find those id's there. Where do I have to look for it ? I want to be informed by my script, if the driver (module) for a specific pci device is available as a loadable module, in-kernel module or not available at all.
Many thanks in advance for your answers and I hope, my question is not too annoying for you developer guys :-)
Cheers,
Phibo
