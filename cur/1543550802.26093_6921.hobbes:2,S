Some of the most important information is not provided. Look at
/proc/interrupts and see if your ethernet board is still working. It looks
as though you have a problem with the ethernet driver hanging. The
fact that CPU usage drops to zero, seems to imply that you will see
all apache activity sleeping on the sockets, waiting for input.
I'd advise that you install linux-2.2.17 also. Linux-2.2.5 does not
have many driver fixes back-ported.
Cheers,
