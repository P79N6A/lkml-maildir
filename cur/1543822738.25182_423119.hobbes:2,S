Sounds like a good idea. In fact, I had miscreated a sun disklabel on a 
disk because it has a slightly different notion of cylinders that I am used 
to from x86; IOW:
dmesg:
SCSI device sdb: 35378533 512-byte hdwr sectors (18114 MB)
fdisk:
Disk /dev/sdb (Sun disk label): 19 heads, 248 sectors, 7200 rpm
7508 cylinders, 2 alternate cylinders, 7510 physical cylinders
0 extra sects/cyl, interleave 1:1
(should have been 7506 cyl, 2 alt, 7508 phys)
And Solaris rightfully barfs about it when scanning disks,
because 7510*19*248 > 35378533. Linux keeps silent,
and I am not sure if I have a silent data corruption there (currently not 
as it seems).
(Since it's just a test box ATM, it's not critical.)
