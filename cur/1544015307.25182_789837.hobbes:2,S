Well, the good news is that read-only filesystems are _sooo_ much simpler 
than any real filesystem that quite frankly, on a "complexity" scale it's 
still way way down there.
Also, if it's not used for backup (and I don't think anybody would), 
there's actually less reason to be back-wards compatible. I know I changed 
cramfs a few times incompatibly, simply becaus "you might as well just 
re-run the user tools to generate the image". It was for a similar need, 
and the image really always goes along with the kernel.
I think squashfs usage would be similar - you'd not have squashfs as a 
standalone media, it would be a "installation medium" thing.
