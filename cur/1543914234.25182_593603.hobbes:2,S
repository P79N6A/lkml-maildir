  or (and here's a wild and crazy idea) what about writing a utility
that auto-generates all that information?
  the biggest hassle in keeping all the documentation up to date is
that much of it is being stored in a manually-updated text file
(MAINTAINERS leaps to mind), so *of course* it's always going to be
out of date.  so why not just fix it so it's auto-generated, the same
way the in-kernel nano-doc stuff is?
  surely, it wouldn't be that hard, at least for the basic parms.  a
combination of egrep, sed and sort would certainly give you the basic
parms.  off the top of my head:
$ egrep '(__setup|early_param)' $(find . -name *.c) | \
> sed -e 's/.*"\(.*\)".*/\1/' | \
> sort -u
$
  of course that's not sufficient, but it took me all of two minutes.
would it be that much work to extend it and deal with once and for
all?
