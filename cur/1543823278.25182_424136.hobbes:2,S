Or figure out which openib.org interface has to change so the
original virt addresses that were registered/handed to the ULP
are passed down to the low level interface driver too.
Seems like a more obvious way to fix the problem.
Someone did suggest this already, right?

parisc has been using dma_ops for several years.
I don't expect dma_ops to become part of generic code.
DMA support is inherently arch specific.
Because of that, I don't look forward to a low level
device driver that is mucking with dma_ops.
