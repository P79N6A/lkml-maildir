What do you mean by removing optimally? Consider teher 2 scenarios:
 - you unload logical device driver which knows all the logical
devices (interfaces) it is bound to and it releases those devices.
- you unload chip driver which knows what logical devices it has
registered and removes them. Logical devices in turn unbind themselves
from the logical drivers thay are bound to (only one for each device
and they have link).
Seems pretty clean to me.

I am confused and need a concrete example. I would think that cases
such as these should not require eny special handling, hardware access
should be hidden from logical drivers by the chip driver. Or if only
difference is the port address then it probably should be set by the
chip driver as attribute of logical device.
Look at the serio system again. psmouse module knows how to talk to
i8042-type ports. It does not rellay matter to it whther the port is
on actual i8042 controller or somewhere else. What matters that it is
PS/2 port and it supports writes and reads and that is it. How exactly
read is performed (what port address, locking, etc) is of no concern
to psmouse. The same I think should be happening here.
