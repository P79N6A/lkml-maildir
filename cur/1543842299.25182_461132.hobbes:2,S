My logic was as follows:
a) vmalloc() can sleep
b) Stephane at some time tested this conde with
   CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP and didn't get sleep-while-atomic warnings out of
   that vmalloc().
c) Hence this code is never called under spinlock, or with local
   interrupts disabled.
d) Hence it is safe to convert the earlier SLAB_ATOMIC into SLAB_KERNEL.
If b) is false then it's the vmalloc() call which is incorrect, not the
SLAB_ATOMIC.
