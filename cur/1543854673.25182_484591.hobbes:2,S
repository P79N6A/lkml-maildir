I thought so.

Nope. I have tested it on 4bpp and above. No monochrome.

Lets look at the new code that I have done with your above parameters. 
       for (i = image->height; i--; ) {
               shift = val = 0;
               n = image->width;
               dst = (u32 __iomem *) dst1;
		while (n--) {
			if (!s) { src++; s = 32; }
			s -= 1;
			color = (swapb32p(src) & (1 << s)) ? 1 : 0;
			val |= color << shift;
		       /* Did the bitshift spill bits to the next long? */
                       if (shift >= 31) {
                               FB_WRITEL(val, dst++);
                               val = (shift == 31) ? 0 :(color >> (32 - shift));
                       }
                       shift += 1;
                       shift &= (32 - 1);
               }
               [ ...]
with 's' taking values from 31 to 0, and 'shift' taking values from 0 to 
31. In the case of bits_per_pixel = 1 we have 
s -= 1;
color = (swapb32p(src) & (1 << s)) ? 1 : 0;
val |= color << shift;
which reduces to val = color;
I'm I seeing it wrong? BTW what is your visual?
