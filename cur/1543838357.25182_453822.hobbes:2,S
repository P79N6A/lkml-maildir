My initial attempt was to free the kmalloc'ed buffer and reallocate it
in vc_allocate (similar to the code in vc_resize) but I realised that
vc_screenbuf kmalloced block is always of the vs_screenbuf_size
length.

I think the above should be fine because vc_resize can be called
either via vc_allocate->visual_init->fbcon_init when the buffer was
not yet allocated or via a tty ioctl etc. and it needs to free the old
buffer.
