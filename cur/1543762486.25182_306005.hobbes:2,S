One can not add entropy data directly to the pool from kernelspace now.
But now noone may do it, since all presented data is not validated.
So when there will be validated HW RNG they still need to pass
it's data through userspace validation daemon
(which btw makes tens to hundreds operations per bit according to FIPS).

It is not panacea and even not always working solution.
If user turn that feature on - he is on his own.
Noone will complain on Linux if NIC is broken and produces wrong
checksum
and HW checksum offloading is enabled using ethtools.
