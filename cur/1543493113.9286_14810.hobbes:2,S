	   I tried lmbench 1.9 on an ultra5 (270 MHz, 128 MB RAM)
   running linux 2.2.2 and compared with an identical machine running
   solaris 2.6(except it had 64M). linux blew solaris away in most of
   the benchmarks except mmap latency.
Wait a second, lat_mmap touches a large part of the set of pages in
the mmap'd area.  If the Solaris machine had half as much memory, and
lat_mmap used a smaller upper limit on the size of the mmap'd area,
then the difference in performance makes sense.
If you have the opportunity, I'd rerun the tests with identical memory
configurations on both systems.
