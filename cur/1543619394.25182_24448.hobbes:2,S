Known issue.  Configure.help has been split up, menuconfig and xconfig
don't know this yet.  If you want to fix it, feel free.  It's probably
not all that hard - just remember what directory you read Config.in
from and look for Configure.help there.
The current config tools are (it is believed) approaching the end of
their lifecycle, so most of the usual suspects aren't terribly eager to
hack on them in 2.5.  That's probably why this isn't fixed yet.
