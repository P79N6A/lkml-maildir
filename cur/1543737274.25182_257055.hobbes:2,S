Hello,
This is a filesystem interface for iRiver "IFP" (flash-based) mp3
players that aren't USB mass storage devices.  It's been [successfully]
tested by ten volunteers on eleven systems using a variety of different
kernel configurations.  (Specifically, both with and without SMP,
PREEMPT.) The distribution of devices and computers used in testing
follows:
device models:
        1x IFP-1xx
        3x IFP-3xx
        1x IFP-5xx
        1x IFP-7xx
        4x IFP-8xx
arch:
        5x single IA32
        1x single IA32 - (HT)
        3x single AMD32
        1x dual   AMD32
        1x single AMD64
No testing was done on big-endian or other non-x86 system.  There was no
placebo control.  Reported side-effects included memory loss, fatigue,
auditory disturbances, hangover, chest pain and dizziness.  This driver
may not be right for everyone; check with your system administrator for
details.
As this is my first kernel hack, I'd appreciate any and all
feedback/suggestions/flames.  Please CC me on replies.
Cheers and thanks in advance,
Geoff
Ps. the patch is against 2.6.8.1, but it's reported to work on 2.6.3.
