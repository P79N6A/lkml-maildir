That's exactly my point.  I don't *want* to have to ask the glibc people.
I want to have the kernel ABI headers ship with the kernel, and only 
with the kernel.
I want to be able to change one header file, recompile my kernel, 
recompile my app, reboot, and pick up the change.  glibc should not even 
be a factor.
