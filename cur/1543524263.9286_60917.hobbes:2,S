My hacks on RTC have been the most recent.  I mailed Paul Gortmaker
about maintaining the driver but have heard nothing.
The patch looks ok at first glance, but I haven't tested it or looked
through it with much thought.  :)
Two requests:
Can you add "SMP cleanup" to the changelog, as version 1.09c credited to
me?
And, can you kill the 2.2.x compatibility code.  RTC is sufficiently
different that it will not work on 2.2.x without more backporting
anyway.
