Just moved my firewall/gateway from 2.6.15 to 2.6.16-rc1, and had a
couple IPv6-related problems really bite me.
1) radvd runs at 100% CPU (CentOS 4 userland, 2.6.15 worked fine).  I
had to kill it.

> Jan 17 21:24:50 pretzel radvd: radvd startup succeeded
2) bind fails (which everyone on my network immediately noticed, and
complained about).

Again, 2.6.15 works just fine.
Config attached.  32-bit x86 uniprocessor w/ HT (thus, SMP config).
