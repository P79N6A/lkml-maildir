I have myself never been sure if the relative times are a good idea or
not. :-) Sometimes I hate them, sometimes they are more convenient...
At any rate, if you click at the tag name, you should get tag page with
full date.

Yes, there are three scenarios:
(i) The patch has been _created_ after the release date. It can't be in
the release.
(ii) The patch has been created before the release date, but _committed_
after the release date. It can't be in the release either.
(iii) The patch has been committed before the release date. It _still_
might not be in the release if it comes from a different branch.
Imagine, say, tglx accepting the patch in his branch, then Linus
releasing new kernel version, and only _then_ Linus merging tglx's
branch.
So the time information isn't really too useful if you want to be any
sort of reliable.

It isn't too hard if we don't forget about git internals either. It's
just that getting this information might not be cheap. But maybe I'm
wrong and this won't be a problem for sane projects. Someone should post
a patch. ;-)
