hm, so an attempt to access xtime_lock.lock results in a null-pointer deref?
x86_64 does novel things, putting xtime_lock into a linker section all of
its own.  At a guess I'd say that your compiler/assembler/linker toolchain
got confused and generated the incorrect address for xtime_lock.  But if
that was the case you'd get oopses 100% of the time - it wouldn't be
intermittent, as your description seems to imply (although it's quite
unclear?).
You could do:
gdb vmlinux
(gdb) p &xtime_lock
(gdb) x/40i main_timer_handler
