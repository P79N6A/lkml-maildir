Hi, I am having problems using some older Emulex fibre adapters on a
ppc64 machine, whenever I load the lpfc driver I get a large number of 
"lpfc 0001:d8:01.0: 1:0321 Unknown IOCB command Data: x0 x3 x0 x0"
with several hundred messages per adapter
and finally I get this message:
lpfc 0001:d8:01.0: 1:0222 Initial FLOGI timeout
lpfc 0001:d8:01.0: 1:0127 ELS timeout Data: x4000000 xfffffe x8a x23
Is this a known issue ?
Let me know if you need patches tested, thanks.
