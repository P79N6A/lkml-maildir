To avoid all sync problems with me, you can always get the latest out of
my CVS.  CVS instructions on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
Check out module 'linux_2_4'.  Branch name is based on the latest Linus
release: hack_2_4_4_pre5, hack_2_4_3, hack_2_4_2, etc.  Using the branch
name is critical: you cannot simply "cvs co linux_2_4" and have things
work.
