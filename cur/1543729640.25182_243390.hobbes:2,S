Are the keycodes unique enough that you can just put the keymaps for both 
remotes into the same table?  I.E. when you wrote your keymaps, did you have 
to remove some of the others to get it to work, or was that just for 
cleanliness?  Otherwise, we'd need to have multiple tables and choose which 
to use based on which remote is being used.
Oh, and do stick around, Karel, someone will need to test the result.
BTW, does anyone know whether the probe function actually needs to check 
whether the product and vendor IDs match the device?  I've seen docs that 
imply yes, but many drivers don't check, and I feel stupid iterating thru the 
table if no.
Have fun,

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive 
property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea.
