Intel actually optimizes this on the P4, what is your
response to that?  Is Intel wasting they time? :-)

It's needed on every access to every TCP and IP header portion
for the case we're talking about in this thread, where the network
device driver gives the networking a packet that ends up with
unaligned IP and TCP headers.
I once considered adding some get_unaligned() uses to the TCP option
parsing code, guess who rejected that patch?  It wasn't me, it was
Linus himself and I came to learn that he's right on this one.
