Honestly, the issue and patch need more thought, IMO.
Regardless of theory, CONFIG_ISA is currently also used to indicate 
legacy ISA devices that are today integrated into southbridges.
And with legacy ISA devices still around, I don't see a whole lot of 
value in differentiating between "I have ISA slots" and "I have ISA 
devices".
