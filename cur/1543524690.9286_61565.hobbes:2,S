I use the patch in question, and can confirm that it does far more
than that. What basically happens is that the user runs, for
example...
	chattr -R -V +c /usr/src
...which causes the `chattr` command to recursively descend from
/usr/src/ telling the kernel to set the +c attribute on every file and
directory it finds, and verbosely tells you what it's doing whilst
it's at it.
Each time the kernel is asked to set the +c attribute on a file that
doesn't already have that attribute set, it promptly compresses it
using the currently specified compression method, and blocks until the
compression is finished.
Likewise, if you specify -c instead of +c then as the kernel clears
the said flag, it also decompresses the file.

I'm not even sure what you mean by that, so can hardly comment
thereon.

If the target directory has the +c attribute set, that happens
automatically, even if it wasn't compressed in the directory it's
being moved from.

You don't have to do that now - once set, it remains set across
mount/umount/reboot until somebody explicitly clears it.

I would suspect that you haven't even tried the patch, and would
suggest you do so, and then clarify your comments if I've
misunderstood them...
Best wishes from Riley.
