Please don't say that -- I perfectly understood what you were saying and as 
such it was of perfect use. There's a large number of non-native English 
speakers around the Linux kernel and noone is expected to write flawless 
English (that's including native speakers in fact).
Getting a native speaker to clean up grammer and spelling is fine ofcourse 
as it's makes for a lower effort read for many others but please don't say 
that something which isn't flawlessly spelled is of no use. As long as the 
content is clear, it's of great use!
Rene.
