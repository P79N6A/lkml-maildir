So I agree that the HPET hardware in newer devices themselves would 
allow longer sleep periods. However, this is not the problem I was raising.
The problem is that the dynamic tick uses a 32-bit variable, 
max_delta_ns, to define that max sleep time of a device in nanoseconds. 
The maximum value that this variable can be assigned is LONG_MAX or 
0x7fffffff nanoseconds (see function clockevent_delta2ns). The value 
0x7fffffff nanoseconds equates to ~2.15 seconds. Hence, without 
increasing the dynamic range of max_delta_ns (ie. make this a 64-bit 
integer) or change the base of this variable from nanoseconds to 
milliseconds, I don't see how the device will ever sleep for longer than 
~2.15 seconds.
I have spent several weeks trying to suppress kernel timers using the 
deferred timers and lengthen the sleep time. I am now able to get the 
device to sleep for minutes but I found that max_delta_ns is a limiting 
factor. I will be surprised if you can sleep for longer than ~2.15 
seconds with the current implementation.
Let me know if this makes sense.

Great thanks.
