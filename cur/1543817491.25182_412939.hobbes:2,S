Wouldn't this be a good opportunity to redefine SCHED_BATCH as 4 instead 
of 3 so that you can use ((p->policy & (SCHED_FIFO|SCHED_RR)) == 0) 
instead of (p->policy != SCHED_NORMAL && p->policy != SCHED_BATCH)? 
That expression will be called fairly frequently and SCHED_BATCH hasn't 
been around long enough for a change of value to break very much use 
space code.
