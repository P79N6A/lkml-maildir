No. But just relying on perfect hardware and concientious sysadmins is
reckless. Hardware /is/ flaky, sysadmins /are/ (sometimes) lazy (and
besides, today they are increasingly just plain Joe Sixpack users). Also,
backing up a few hundred GiB is /not/ fun, and then keeping track of all
the backups is messy.
Also, I'm not claiming that they are /solely/ responsible, but not having
the filesystem fall apart utterly every time some bug breaths on it /is/ a
requirement.
