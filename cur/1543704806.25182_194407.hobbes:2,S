Recent versions of emacs, for those that use it, have whitespace.el (for
cleaning up as you go along).  It can cleanup different kinds of
whitespace based on settings.  Check C-h f whitespace-describe for more
details.  Got used to that heavily at one point, these days I am kind of
neutral, sometimes I do it, sometimes I don't bother.
