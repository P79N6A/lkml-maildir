There is a known problem in xfrm4_tunnel_check_size if your underlying
path MTU is a multiple of 8.  So if your path MTU is 1480, you'll need
to lower it to 1476 before it will work.
You can query the path MTU using "ip r g <remote-gateway>".  If it
is a multiple of 8, you can change it by doing
ip r a <remote-gateway> ... mtu <current-mtu - 4>
