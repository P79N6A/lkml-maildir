I apologize for lack of insight in this matter, but... Where is the packet
fixed/variable size set? In the UDF filesystem? Or somewhere in metadata of the
CD? Can I alter it with some data already on the CD, without losing the data?
If the driver cannot handle variable packet size, and it is not matter of
filesystem but matter of CDRW (which I presume), shouldn't the whole pktsetup
fail?
Thanks in advance
