My suspicion at this point is that with certain RAM layouts, simply
iterating over PFN's is simply not working out.
pfn_to_page() seems to be doing no range checking, and with sparsemem
vmemmap, which sparc64 always uses, this can be problematic.
It just blindly goes "vmemmap + pfn" which is asking for trouble, in
particular when the physical RAM layout really is sparse.
Maybe it's enough to add a pfn_valid() check here?  If pfn_valid()
means there is a vmemmap translation setup for that page struct too,
it would work.
