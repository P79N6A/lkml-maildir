Hello,
after patching 2.2.13 with the International 2.2.13.1 patch I tried to configure
it by make xconfig and after selecting all crypto options as module I ran into
the problem  in the Block devices section that I can't select anything for
"General encryption support (EXPERIMENTAL)" even so Module support and N are
black and not grey like Y. When I clicked on M for module support and leave via
Save and Exit I get the Message the following message:
ERROR - Attempting to write value for unconfigured variable
(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP_GEN).
With make menuconfig this doesn't happen and the correct value is written to
.config. 
Has anyone else experienced this problem ?
Bye,
Henning
