This is just manually overriding the automatic time source selection.
You're using the PIT (programmable interval timer) over what was being
automatically selected (according the to the dmesg you sent me, the
pmtmr or ACPI PM timer) by your kernel config. 
As clock=pit seemed to solve the problem, it looks like its a ACPI PM
issue.
