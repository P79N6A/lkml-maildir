oh, also:
Please check with ATA/ATAPI-7 command names, rather than just using the 
WIN_xxx names with a new prefix.  Sometimes the IDE author (from ages 
past) would pick names that suited them or the code, but diverged from 
the common T13 command name.
Examples:
1) WIN_DIAGNOSE -> ATA_CMD_EDD
2) WIN_QUEUED_SERVICE -> ATA_CMD_SERVICE
3) WIN_STANDBYNOW1 -> ATA_CMD_STANDBY_IMMED
4) WIN_SETIDLE1 -> ATA_CMD_IDLE
5) WIN_CHECKPOWERMODE1 -> ATA_CMD_CHK_PWR_MODE
6) WIN_SLEEPNOW1 -> ATA_CMD_SLEEP
7) some are old ATA-2-era commands, some are vendor-specific commands. 
Not much you can do about the naming of these.
8) remove all xxx_ONCE that are not used
9) hdreg.h lists commands in opcode value order
10) Kill WIN_SRST (dups properly named WIN_DEVICE_RESET)
