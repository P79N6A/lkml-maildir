I tried to copy the 4.9 GB file from the _local_ computer back to the server, it copies 2.1 GB of the file and quits. This is what strace says:
write(4, "8", 1)                        = -1 EFBIG (File too large)
--- SIGXFSZ (File size limit exceeded) @ 0 (0) ---
+++ killed by SIGXFSZ +++
Is this normal? Haven't tried with 2.4.20 yet...
