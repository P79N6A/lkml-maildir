Only in piix driver (Intel & Efar) and user have to explicitly compile
support for it, it have nothing to do with kernel version and everything
with driver version.

Poor Marcin, he is so misinformed by bad people trying to spoil ATA stuff.
Bad patches? Who is the bad guy making the bad patches?
Let me guess, it is Vojtech removing others people copyrighted "sick
timing tables". Or maybe it is Jens doing at least TCQ?
Or maybe it is me... etc.

What a nice FUD.
What is this major design flaw? Experimental (on demand) code in piix
driver? Or you no longer being ATA maintainer?
Ok, I really wanted to be quiet, but this time it is too much...
sorry for bad words/irony but that is how things look like...
Some people (me included) are putting much effort in cleaning/improving
all this mess, and you keep spreading FUD and discrediting them.
