There are several possibilities, but I would suspect you have memory which
is just marginal, and with some combination of access patterns you trigger
a sig 11 problem. I have the same board, with 72 bit ECC capable memory,
and I'm running all of the BIOS speed options (section 4.4 of the manual)
set at default, rather than tuning for any extra bit of performance.
If you have pushed any of the CPU or memory speeds, obviously that's a
place to return to default, but I suspect what you have is marginal
memory. Best is to borrow a stick and run on other memory, 2nd best is to
slow the speeds a bit and see if that works better.
Clearly this is only an educated guess.
