Trivial?  Sure, if the patches apply cleanly.  Not trivial if the changesets
have other changesets in the way.
But I have a 70 line shell script which does this, I'm not sure why you can't
write the same thing.

That's because you didn't read the documentation which you appear to love

work /tmp/linux-2.5 bk c2r -rv2.6.9 mm/vmscan.c
1.231

You passed a legal rev syntax to the command.  I can't help it if you don't
understand the tool.

You know, I like the way you politely offer to help out by sending in
patches to the documentation for this tool which you get to use for free.
You are an inspiration to us and you are just the sort of user we love
to help.

No worries, Chuck, after careful consideration of your skills we don't see
a match at this time.  But we'll keep your resume on file and thanks for
your interest.
