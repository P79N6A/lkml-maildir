I put it to a test in a default scenario (quotaon sometime at boot).
SUSE Linux 10.1 with reiserfs(usrquota,grpquota).
This is the result:
add_dquot_ref: 30 files in sb->s_files for hda2
add_dquot_ref: Restarting after 12 files
add_dquot_ref: 30 files in sb->s_files for hda2
add_dquot_ref: Restarted 1 times
add_dquot_ref: 30 files in sb->s_files for hda2
add_dquot_ref: Restarting after 12 files
add_dquot_ref: 30 files in sb->s_files for hda2
add_dquot_ref: Restarted 1 times
Surprisingly few. I had expected to see more instantiated (but not necessarily
open) files.

 /* Return 0 if dqput() won't block (note that 1 doesn't necessarily mean blocking) */
BTW, whilst looking for the function to return a readable name, I came
across reiserfs_bdevname() and bdevname(). The former uses sb->s_id, the
latter struct gendisk->hd_name+partition number.
Could someone elaborate on why there are two ways?
