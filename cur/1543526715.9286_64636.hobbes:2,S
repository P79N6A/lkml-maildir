Note I've been having exactly the same trouble with IDE CD and 2.3.46. It
seems to be due to PIIX tuning or IDE auto DMA. Drive works fine with 2.2.x
(up to 2.2.15pre9). i686 UP, Red Hat 6.1 + binutils-2.9.5.0.27; various
compilers tried (egcs-1.1.2-24 (RH), gcc-2.95.2, late egcs snapshots)
Things to try (Thanks to Jens Axboe):
- Just read a block off the drive (so you rule out the filesystem) [Hangs
  here]
- Get it to play an audio CD (check commands work, no data transfer) [Works
  for me]
