Now, when NFS has been mentioned.
To test reiser{fs,4} we use
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/namesys-utils/nfs_fh_stale.c
 which creates
given number of threads each performing randomly reads, writes,
truncates, renames, fsyncs, and unlinks over the shared set of files. As
its name implies it was initially created to test support for the stale
NFS handle detection, but turned out to be quite useful for the general
testing also.
