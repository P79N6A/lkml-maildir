But were the bugs being fixed introduced by earlier bug fixes? Or by new
features, performance optimizations, new drivers, etc.?
Looked at another way: It is possible for the fix to bug A to introduce a
new bug B. And then the fix for bug B to introduce a new bug C. And then
the fix for bug C to introduce a new bug D. ... ad nauseum. However, in
the real world these chains are finite, so long as only bug fixes are
being introduced. This leads eventually to stability. On the other hand,
if new features are being introduced, new bugs continue to arise, and
stability is as elusive as it has been with "stable" Linux kernels.
