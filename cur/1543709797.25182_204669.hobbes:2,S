info threads shows a list of threads. Heavy/light weight processes doesn't 
matter. Thread frame shown is incorrect.
I looked at i386 dependent code again. Following code in it is incorrect. I 
never noticed it because this code is rarely used in full version of kgdb:
+void sleeping_thread_to_gdb_regs(unsigned long *gdb_regs, struct task_struct 
*p)
....
+	gdb_regs[_EBP] = *(int *)p->thread.esp;
We can't guss ebp this way. This line should be removed.
+	gdb_regs[_DS] = __KERNEL_DS;
+	gdb_regs[_ES] = __KERNEL_DS;
+	gdb_regs[_PS] = 0;
+	gdb_regs[_CS] = __KERNEL_CS;
+	gdb_regs[_PC] = p->thread.eip;
+	gdb_regs[_ESP] = p->thread.esp;
This should be gdb_regs[_ESP] = &p->thread.esp

Present threads support code changes calling convention of do_IRQ. Most 
believe that to be an absolute no.
Since you consider it a must-have, I'll check whether above changes suggested 
by me make info threads listing correct in most cases.
