I get the same behavior on two machines here (a desktop with Duron/SIS 735
chipset/ATI 8500 video and a laptop with PIII/BX chipset/S3 Savage MX video)
so it is not hardware specific.
I am running debian testing, the laptop has XFree 4.1.0 from debian, the
desktop has XFree 4.2.0 from xfree.org .
I am not runnning SMP or preempt. Preempt kernel on the laptop last
worked in 2.5.33 . When enabling preempt in 2.5.36 I get an oops, while
in 2.5.37 I get a bunch of oopses, continuously scrolling off the
screen.
