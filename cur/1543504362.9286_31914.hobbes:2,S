You DO NOT need both. <rpc/rpc.h> is GLibC header. You can not use
GLibC functions in kernel anyway so what's the point of including <rpc/rpc.h> ?

Plus updates to the networking code and so on.

Hardly. Basic rule remains the same: GLibC and kernel headers are oil and
water. You can not mix them.

The only right solution is just to not use <rpc/rpc.h>... It's wrong header.
You do not need it. If functions needed to you are in kernel you should find
them in some kernel header file, if not -- you are out of luck and should
include them in your module. In any case you do not need headers from GLibC ...
