Yep. It works fine. I had to back out the memmove change because it no longer
served network packets correctly for some reason, but I'm still running on
the new TGA buffer and I can hit Ctrl-L all I want and it redraws correctly.
I'm using egcs-1.1.2 so maybe your compiler is miscompiling it?
I think egcs had 64-bit bugs in previous releases if I remember right, at least
the UltraSparc64 did.
