Ah. That is an optimization question, not a question of kernel/user mode.
Since the error checking for source and destination both include doing
a stat and statfs, the device information (and FS info) can both be retrieved.
And mmap doesn't require data transfer "twice" (local copy). Since that copy 
only pagefaults (though read/write may be faster for some files - I thought
that was true for small files that fit in cache, and large files faster via
mmap and depends on the page size; and the tradeoff would be system
dependant).
And since both source and destination may be remote you do get to decide
based on source and destination devices: if they are the same, and one on
a remote node, then BOTH will be on the remote, then you get to use the
CIFS/NFS file copy. (check the doc on "stat/statfs" for additional info).
I don't believe it works when source and destination are on DIFFERENT remote
nodes, though.
Strictly up to the implementation of cp/mv.
Though you will loose portability of cp/mv. (Of course, you also loose
it with a syscall for file copy too; as well as the MUCH more complicated
implementation/security checks).
