Yes, it always copies the data twice.  A socket does the same thing.
Linux may or may not be capable of the remapping trick but I couldn't
find a way to do it.  In general, FreeBSD seems to assume that page table
manipulation is cheap, and Linux that it is expensive (this from not very
thorough reading of both kernels).
I bet there'd be some point, probably different for each platform, at
which page flipping became a win.  I also bet it'd be much bigger than
just one page.
