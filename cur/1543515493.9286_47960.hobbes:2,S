I think you haven't read all the postings in the news about people complainig
that xterm or ssh or whatever doesn't work, because they have removed the
/dev/pts entry from fstab ? 
In a perfect Linux world, everbody knows what he is doing and is a perfect
unix system administrator. In the real world, a lot of people doesn't know
anything about Unix. They think, I don't know what /dev/pts is, so I don't
need it and I can remove it.
We also have to think on this people,not only on hacker, developer and
admins.

Linux is like a Vorlon.  It is incredibly powerful, gives terse,
cryptic answers and has a lot of things going on in the background.
