Actually if you look at the archives (ID 39A3A608.1F984C60@yahoo.com)
you will see that I've stated this will be done for 2.5 a couple of
months ago.  (Which is also why PCI support in ne.c hasn't tracked that
of ne2k-pci.c - I want to avoid encouraging new PCI users of ne.c)
There is no urgency in trying to squeeze a patch like this in the back
door of a 2.4.0 release.  For example, there are people out there now
who are using the ne.c driver to run both ISA and PCI cards in the same 
box without having to use 2 different drivers.  We can wait until 2.5.0
to break their .config file.
[ I've several other 8390 related patches I've been sitting on - trying
to not contribute to the delay of 2.4.0 unless explicitly asked, such
as the 8390.h get_module_symbol deletion.  Other 8390 patches I have 
are a separated Tx timeout for 8390.c, kill off dev->rmem_start/end 
and use ioremap() where required, and replace old check/request_region()
with code that makes use of the newer resource structures. ]
Good to know people are still keeping an eye out for dead code though...
Thanks,
Paul.
