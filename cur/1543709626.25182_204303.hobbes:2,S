Here it is.
The patch is only one line for 2.6.4-rc2. (I also did a little formatting 
adjustment to better comply with CodingStyle)
For the 2.4.26-pre1 kernel, I also backported the return codes correction patch 
from Oliver Neukum.
The problem with the write function was that, in non-blocking mode, after 
submitting the first urb, the function would return with -EAGAIN, not reporting 
to the application that in fact it had already sent "transfer_length" bytes. 
This way the application would have to send the data *again* causing lots of 
errors.
It did return the correct amount with my first patch, because the writecount was 
being updated on the end of the loop. However this was wrong for blocking I/O.
The "transfer_length" local variable is still needed because if we used the 
transfer_buffer_length field from the urb, then on a second call to write, if 
the urb was still pending (in non-blocking mode), the write would return an 
incorrect amount of data written.
Anyway, this time I tested it using blocking and non-blocking I/O and it works 
for both cases. Even better, this patch only changes the behaviour for 
non-blocking I/O, and keeps the same behaviour for the more usual blocking I/O 
(at least on kernel 2.6).
Please apply,
