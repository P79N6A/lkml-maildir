Correct. However, a cmpxchg may have to acquire that cacheline multiple 
times in a highly contented situation. A fetchadd acquires the cacheline 
only once.

We have long tuned that portion of the code and therefore we are 
skeptical of changes. But if we cannot measure a difference to a 
generic implemenentation then it would be okay.
