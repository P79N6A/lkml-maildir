Not the point. It is an absolute pig to have to allocate extra swap just
because extra memory was added. You might not have a bay free. You might
not have the space knocking around to allocate as swap. It's not about the
money, it's about adaptability. 2.2 was perfectly happy before, why this
giant leap backwards? If I quadruple the memory in my laptop to 512Mb, do
I have to carve up my partitions just to get an extra 768Mb of swap? Or
must I turn off swap completely? What if you are working on a device where
everything is at a premium, both permamanent storage and memory, but you
do have a little to spare as swap?
It just seems like an overly onerous restriction.
