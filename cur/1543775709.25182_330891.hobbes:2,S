                    (see Documentation/DMA-API.txt for details).
We generally try to use file/path names rooted at the top-level
linux directory.
+The DMA:able address space is the lowest 16 MB of _physical_ memory.
 The DMA-able
+Also the transfer block may not cross page boundaries (which are 64k).
 I would write:                                        (which are 64 KB).
if I knew that was correct, but I don't.
Does Linux limit all ISA-DMA to not crossing 64 KB boundaries?
I haven't looked at the code yet, just PC-AT Technical Reference,
which says that DMA controller 1 is limited to 8-bit transfers and
64 KB blocks and DMA controller 2 is limited to 16-bit data transfers
and 128 KB boundaries.
Does i386-compatible and later chipsets or LPC change/affect this?
(I see that you cover 8/16-bit transfers later in the doc.)
+To translate the virtual address to a physical use the normal DMA
+API. Do _not_ use isa_virt_to_phys() even though it does the same
+thing. The reason for this is that you will get a requirement to ISA
+(instead of only ISA_DMA_API).
I don't understand what you are trying to say in:
... is that you will get a requirement to ISA....
Oh, it's Kconfig-related, right?  So maybe:
"... is that you will get a config requirement for ISA..." ?
+Set the address from where the transfer should start (this needs to
+be word-aligned for 16-bit transfers) and how many bytes to transfer.
"word-aligned" is probably ambiguous to some people and in some
x86 CPU modes.  Better to say "16-bit aligned" IMO.
+flags = claim_dma_flags();
Should be claim_dma_lock();
+if (dma_get_residue(channel) != 0)
+	printk(KERN_ERR "Incomplete DMA transfer!\n");
A printk should identify where it comes from (like a module ID or
source file name) and possibly what DMA channel and how much
residue there was (but at least the module/source ID).
+It is the drivers' responsibility to make sure that the machine isn't
           driver's
HTH.
