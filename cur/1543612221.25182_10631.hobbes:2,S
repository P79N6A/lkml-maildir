Hi!
On hp omnibook xe3, Sound is working poorly. Its maestro3 *plays*, but
repeats portions.... No wonder.... It probably did not receive correct
irq (while playing music!):
root@amd:~# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:      14014          XT-PIC  timer

So I did as adviced, appended pci=biosirq to commandline:

I did specify pci=biosirq, and it *still* suggests me using
pci=biosirq. Smells like bug. Linux-2.4.14.
