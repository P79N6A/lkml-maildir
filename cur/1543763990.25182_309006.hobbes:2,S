Actually not. I think the whole point of the C99 (POSIX integer)
types is to avoid problems like you cite. Nobody should be using
types that begin with an underscore in user-code anyway. That
name-space is reserved.
One cannot just use 'int' or 'long', in particular when interfacing
with an operating system. For example, look at the socket interface
code. Parameters are put into an array of longs and a pointer to
this array is passed to the socket interface. It's a mess when
converting this code to 64-bit world. If originally one used a
structure of the correct POSIX integer types, and a pointer to
the structure was passed, then absolutely nothing in the source-
code would have to be changed at all when compiling that interface
for a 64-bit machine. The continual short-cuts, with the continual
"special-case" hacks is what makes porting difficult. That's what
the POSIX types was supposed to help prevent.
That's why I think if there was a stdint.h file in the kernel, when
people were performing maintenance or porting their code, they
could start using those types.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
