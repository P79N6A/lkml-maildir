No, it is not a factor of 1000. I benched this by adding a 
couple tests to lmbench once. pthread_create->exit->join combo
was about 130 microseconds, fork+exit was ~700 microseconds and
clone(CLONE_VM)+exit about 60 microseconds. This was on a 
Celeron/466.
To get rid of the manager thread, I was under the impression 
that CLONE_PARENT was supposed to do this? If not then what
use it is?
