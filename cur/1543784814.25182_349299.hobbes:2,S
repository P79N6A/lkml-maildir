Either I goofed on the hand application of this patch, or it isn't
working.  Curious thing is that it works with some config files, but
not with others.  When I first reported this problem, all my builds
had worked except for the sn2_defconfig one.  With this patch applied
I'm seeing bigsur_defconfig fail quite regularly.
E.g. this sequence (starting from a clean tree):
 $ cp arch/ia64/configs/bigsur_defconfig .config
 $ yes '' | make oldconfig
 $ make prepare
leaves me with an include/asm-ia64/asm-offsets.h that only has the
definition of IA64_TASK_SIZE at 0.
