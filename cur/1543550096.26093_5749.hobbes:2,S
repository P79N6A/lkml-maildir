Binary compatibility in C++ was NEVER an option, on any platform. The C++
standard specifically excludes any definition for the binary layout of classes
and calling conventions.  Anyone who writes "modules" (e.g. DLLs, drivers,
whatever) knows that you can't have cross-module C++ calls.  Everything must be
translated to C calls with a standard calling convention (typically the Pascal
calling convention on Windows and OS/2).
