commit 2dec3ba8d872aa3ffbcdb8f6f8a2c0bcd44e9910 puzzles me.
git-bisect just fingered it as responsible for my "backlight doesn't turn on"
suspend/resume regression on the Thinkpad X60.  I think it's lying.
Why?  Because afaict, drivers/video/output.c is never compiled.
That commit adds the driver, but doesn't touch any Makefile, and I
don't see anything obvious in the follow-in commits that would 'enable' it.
Asides from git-bisect failing me again[1], what gives with this file?

[1] bisecting suspend regressions _really_ sucks.  Each time I've tried this
I've found 2-3 different ways we regressed along the bisection, making it
hard to say "good" or "bad" when the answer is "bad, but broken differently"
