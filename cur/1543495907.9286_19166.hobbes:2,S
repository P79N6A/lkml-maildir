Some of you may have seen the recent benchmark results that show
problems with the throughput of Linux/Samba when running the netbench
benchmark on a large server. While the way that benchmark was
conducted leaves a lot to be desired and the results were not exactly
accurate they did serve to point out areas that need improving.
The problem with tuning for netbench is that you need _very_ deep
pockets to setup a full lab that can run the test. To overcome this
I've written a couple of tools that allow you to reproduce the results
with only one or two machines.
Please have a look at 
ftp://samba.org/pub/tridge/dbench/README
 if you
are interested in trying these tools and helping to optimise
Linux/Samba.
Cheers, Tridge
