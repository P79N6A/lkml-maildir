except sizeof(struct disk_stats)=44, so we run out of percpu space at 744
disks.
Can't think of anything very clever there, except to go and un-percpuify the
disk stats.  I think that's best, really - disk requests only come in at 100
to 200 per second - atomic_t's or int-plus-per-disk-spinlock will be fine.
