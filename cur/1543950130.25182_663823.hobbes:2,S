If someone writes (!x & !y) instead of (!x && !y) because both x and y
have to be evaluated, this means that both x and y have side effects.
Please keep in mind that the C language does not specify whether x or
y has to be evaluated first, so if x and y have to be evaluated in
that order, an expression like (!x & !y) can be the cause of very
subtle bugs. I prefer readability above brevity.
