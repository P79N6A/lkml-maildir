I've just finished a quick test cycle with 2.4.10.  Here are the results
we observed:
There are two tests running, both with HIMEM set to 64G.  
machine test1:  2xPIII, 2G RAM/4G Swap.  Appears to be in a memory
related deadlock.  All test related processes save one are in D state. 
Vmstat indicates no swapping activity.  Top says both processors are
~95% idle.  The exception is the TTCP test, which has a very small
memory footprint and is running normally.
machine test4:  4xPIII, 1G/2G.  Appears to be running normally, but top
indicates frequent stalls with CPU idle times shooting up to 90% on all
processors for brief, but recurring periods.
No processes have been killed by OOM at this point.
