Not only is it racy, but it doesn't even do all of the checks that 
copy_to/from_user does. access_ok only validates that the region given 
is potentially valid, not that it actually is. Using access_ok only 
allows you to use __copy_to/from_user instead, which skips the same 
checks that access_ok does - not worth it unless you do repeated copies 
to/from the same region of memory.
