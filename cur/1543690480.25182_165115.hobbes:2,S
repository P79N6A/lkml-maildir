Hello Stephen,

Yes, I know. I did not have the time to hack on the Hexium Orion driver 
recently.
> Builds fine if it is deleted; don't have real hardware.
But I do. ;-) Please leave it in. I know it's an annoying warning, but 
the data will be useful once I've added real input selection support 
with proper usage of the setup data.
If this patch has already been applied, don't worry -- I'll resend this 
stuff then...
