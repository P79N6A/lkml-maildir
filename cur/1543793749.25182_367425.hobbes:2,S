Hi
    i change the skb when the tcp connect to aother. i mean,
i add a ip_options which include a source route in it.
reset the inet_sk(sk)->saddr to zero and reroute it.
all this done in a NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT hook.
the result is, when the host receive a ACK+SYN, a new
SYN is sent, it should be a ACK instead.
why?
