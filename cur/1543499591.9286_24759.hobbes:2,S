Linux Gods,
The FENRIS (nwfs) source code for linux is now available for ftp at
207.109.151.240.  We apologize for being some 17 days late with this first
release.  Novell raised some legal issues (threatened litigation).  We
achieved resolution with Novell Wednesday this week.  we are pleased that
Novell has chosen to support our efforts to provide this technology to the
Linux Community (since they figured out they had no valid case with us, and
really and truly wanted to find a way to get along with us moving forward).
We applaud Novell's decision to take the high road in their relatiionship
with TRG.
Attached are the release notes for this version.  The version is
downloadable from either ww.timpanogas.com or ftp from 207.109.151.240.
Jeff Merkey
P.S.  FEED THE WOLF
