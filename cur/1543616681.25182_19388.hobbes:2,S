This patch does make OOM killer wait much longer before killing, thus system 
stays under mem pressure longer and cache shrinks fully:
bash-2.03# oom_trigger; free
Terminated
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        126208      69068      57140 <==         0          0      12876
-/+ buffers/cache:      56192      70016
Swap:            0          0          0
bash-2.03# oom_trigger; free
Terminated
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        126208      65568      60640 <==         0          0       9412
-/+ buffers/cache:      56156      70052
Swap:            0          0          0
Note that second free isn't less than first one. With stock kernel you'll get
'free' falling after each oom kill.

Yes indeed :-)

Same here. I modified the printk (# of pages instead of Mb):
-printk(KERN_DEBUG "out_of_memory: cache size %d Mb, since = 
%lu.%02lu\n",mega, since/HZ, since%HZ);
+printk(KERN_DEBUG "out_of_memory: page_cache_size=%d, 
since=%lu.%02lu\n",page_cache_size.counter, since/HZ, since%HZ);
out_of_memory: page_cache_size=6236, since=23.33
out_of_memory: page_cache_size=6220, since=23.49
out_of_memory: page_cache_size=6220, since=23.50
out_of_memory: page_cache_size=6220, since=23.55
out_of_memory: page_cache_size=6178, since=23.80
out_of_memory: page_cache_size=6178, since=23.88
Out of Memory: Killed process 1987 (a.out).
