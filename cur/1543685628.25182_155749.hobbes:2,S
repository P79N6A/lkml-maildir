Subject: 2.4.21/2.4.22-rc1: IDE error message on startup

Dear Linux kernel maintainers,
the following problem (aka bug?) appeared in 2.4.21 and still exists in
2.4.22-rc1 (kernels prior to 2.4.21 work fine):
SETUP:
various mostly older PCs (486, Pentium I) and various smaller IDE drives
(can would be happy to more details if needed)
PROBLEM:
With Linux 2.4.21 or 2.4.22-rc1 (not with prior versions using the same
.config however) on startup I get the following error messages for any
connected IDE disk (but not ATAPI CR-ROM):
hda: attached ide-disk driver.
hda: task_no_data_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: task_no_data_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
Whether I compile with CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE set or not does not
make a difference, by the way.
If there's any more info I can provide (kernel configs maybe?) or things
I could test please do not hesitste to let me know.
I'd appreciate your feedback.
Georg
