Yes, it is.  And although our mandate is to fix things
like this without grafted-on low latency hacks, zap_page_range()
may be one case where simply popping the lock is the best solution.
Not sure.

This adds probably-unneeded extra work - we shouldn't go
dropping the lock unless that is actually required.  ie:
poll ->need_resched first.    Possible?
