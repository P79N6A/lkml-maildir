I have a patch that overrides the ->readdir method for /proc/.netns,
so that you can no longer read the directory contents, but you still
can guess one by guessing and opening files in it. Overriding the 
->lookup to screw one up looks like "shadowing" technics.
OTOH - consider you have the ids of existing net namespaces, but cannot 
read the contents on any but yours. So what? This information is useless
for you. So I dropped this part of a patch.

Have you ever bothered about /proc/<pid> change?

So, how are you going to filter the lookup? The problem I see - you have
a process that opened the /proc/.netns/X directory (he onws that namespace)
and the other one trying to do the same. The VFS layer finds the hashed
dentry corresponding to this /proc/.netns/X. The only way you can prevent
VFS from giving one to the second task is to override .d_revalidate method 
and drop that dentry....
But we've already tried to walk this way with no luck.

This is not about pid namespace, this is about net namespace and
tuning pids management to facilitate networking needs is not the right
thing to do.

Proc consists of two parts - the <pid>-s one with generated-on-the-fly
entries and the static one that is represented by proc_dir_entry tree.
Do you propose to mix those two?

What namespace do you mean by "non-global"?
