That would be fine with me. At least this would not confuse at least me
about what's up with it. matchid would be even more obvious.
Perhaps "validate" could be used too, becouse the method is
not acting on equivalent objects.

Fine with me. This would be not confusing.

Common or not on unix driver binding has already a meaning and
the term confused at least one person (me).
Also please think about the following: terms should always
be related to the object they act *on* and not the object they
are the *method of* - becouse this is already known by the
"method from" relation. Therefore validate or match is more
"obvious" then bind at the respecitve places. IMHO.
