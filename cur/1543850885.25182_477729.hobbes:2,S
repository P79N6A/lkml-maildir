A simpler alternative that I thought about would be to restrict the
resource contoller hierarchies to be strict subtrees of the process
container hierarchy - so at each stage in the hierarchy, a container
could either inherit its parent's node for a given resource or have a
new child node (i.e. be in the same cpuset or be in a fresh child
cpuset).
This is a much simpler abstraction to present to userspace (simply one
flag for each resource controller in each process container) and might
be sufficient for all reasonable scenarios.
