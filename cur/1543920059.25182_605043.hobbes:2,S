Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill but...
Clearly documented responsibilities?  Yes.
Prescribed process?  No.
If someone sends me a patch, and I review it, and I find a couple of
problems, do I need to negotiate with the submitter before correcting
them and putting a "Reviewed-by" tag on it (along with my
Signed-off-by before sending it upstream)?
The above clause (b) seems to say that I do.  Is that something we
want to mandate?
My take on the responsibilities implied by Reviewed-by: is that the
code has been inspected, comprehended, considered, and found to be
both appropriate and without discernible error.  The process by which
the code got to that state is not relevant to the tag (though it
probably is relevant to the general health of the community).
