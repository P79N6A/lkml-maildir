actually, i think you'd want to do just the opposite.  allocating the
extra pmds and ptes during read-ahead is exactly what you want to do,
while diddling the entries in already existing pte's will just break page
faulting in subtle ways.
so i see two different approaches.  1 is minimal, and leaves the existing
code intact, while 2 substantially changes generic file mapping.
1.  pre-allocate pte's during read-ahead, and do read-ahead just as we've
discussed.
2.  fault in and map in entire clusters at a time.  if the page fault
happens on the first page in a cluster, then watch for sequential cluster
faults, and do read-ahead.
