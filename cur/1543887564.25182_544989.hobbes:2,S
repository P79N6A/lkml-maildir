(and those above are 2.6.22-rc1 of course)
well, I tried to apply those patches and when I compile I get this error:
  CC      net/ipv6/exthdrs.o
net/ipv6/exthdrs.c: In function ‘ipv6_rthdr_rcv’:
net/ipv6/exthdrs.c:390: error: ‘struct sk_buff’ has no member named ‘h’
net/ipv6/exthdrs.c:391: error: ‘struct sk_buff’ has no member named ‘h’
net/ipv6/exthdrs.c:391: error: ‘struct sk_buff’ has no member named ‘h’
net/ipv6/exthdrs.c:398: error: ‘struct sk_buff’ has no member named ‘h’
make[2]: *** [net/ipv6/exthdrs.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [net/ipv6] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
It's probably totally unrelated but sadly a showstopper for testing the
new sysfs patches,
