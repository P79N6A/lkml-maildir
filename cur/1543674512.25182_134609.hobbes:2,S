Yes, the static declartion was interlaced too. What I meant to say is that
cacheline sharing feature helped alloc_percpu/static percpu, compensate
for the small extra memory reference cost in getting __percpu_offset[]
when you compare with kmalloc_percpu_new.

Sure, it might help per-cpu data but will it cause performance
regression elsewhere? (other users of smp_processor_id).  I can run it 
through the same tests and find out.  Maybe it'll make good paper material 
for later? ;)
Thanks,
