That's true. We don't mind having different groupings for
different resources. But what I was sying in this thread is
"I didn't *propose* this thing, I just *agreed* that this
might be usefull for someone."
So if we're going to have different groupings for different
resources what's the use of "container" grouping all "controllers"
together? I see this situation like each task_struct carries
pointers to kmemsize controller, pivate pages controller,
physical pages controller, CPU time controller, disk bandwidth
controller, etc. Right? Or did I miss something?
