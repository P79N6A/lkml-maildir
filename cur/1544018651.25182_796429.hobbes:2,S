If I placed
xfs_sync_inodes(ip->i_mount, SYNC_DELWRI);
xfs_sync_inodes(ip->i_mount, SYNC_DELWRI | SYNC_IOWAIT);
directly to xfs_flush_device, I got lock dependency warning (though not a 
real deadlock).
So synchronous flushing definitely needs some thinking and lock 
rearchitecting. If you sync it asynchronously, a deadlock possibility will 
actually turn into spurious -ENOSPC (because the flushing thread will wait 
untill the main thread sleeps for 500ms, drops the lock and returns 
ENOSPC).
