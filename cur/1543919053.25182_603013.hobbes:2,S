It was a patch series after all. But as Greg puts it, be persistent.

Are there any other drivers besides vgacon and fbcon that use vt.c?

I see. That probably means the explanation of values moves from Kconfig 
to Documentation/. Somehow I think we could do without doc and let 
interested starts find out for themselves and learn a little about 
vgacon/fbcon. ;)

And then there is fbiterm, which supports at least 16 fg/16 bg with ... 
the whole Unicode set of chars. :)

But 0x80 might be interpreted in a different fashion for some othercon, 
yielding for example superbold rather than blinking.
I'll have to try this, because usually, setterm operates on TTYs
rather than VCs.
