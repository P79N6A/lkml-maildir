Or even by root.

The su-pid is a temporary measure set by root after evaluating the current 
situation, and additionally limiting this by su-nr(pid)-threads may probably 
be a good idea.  Maybe something like this:
	if (nr_threads >= max_threads)
		if ((p->pid != su_pid) || (nr_threads >= (max_threads + su_pid_threads)))
			goto bad_fork_cleanup_count;
But I really don't think this is critical.
Thanks!
