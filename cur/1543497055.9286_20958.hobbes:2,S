   HPFS use position,length pairs.  But its a tradeoff, not a clear win.
   Consider the case of a huge file with lots of fragments.  We want to
   find block x in the last half of the file.
This is why any scheme using extents must also be combined with
appropriate algorithsm to avoid fragmentation.  If you look at a typical
ext2 filesystem, most files aren't fragmented at all; allocating files
across multiple block groups and using preallocation really helps avoid
fragmentation issues.
