Indeed. That would solve the problem...

The idea Jeff Merkey gave us is even simpler and should work
ok every time. I think I'll implement it RSN and try if it
works ok for Linux.
(maybe with the twist that we /do/ allow merges on the queue
that's being processed by the disk, but no insertions of new
requests)
