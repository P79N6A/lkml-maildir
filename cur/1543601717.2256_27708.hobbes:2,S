RAID does not know about "free space" (that is a filesystem thing), so that
would be either some strange interaction between the filesystem and lower
layers, or a measurement error - I guess.
High fragmentation could lead to extra filesystem activity, but that's not
really something the RAID can influence.

Please check that your disks are using DMA (hdparm /dev/hdX). You should
see something like:
[root@eagle /root]# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)                <=========== INDICATES DMA
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 782/128/63, sectors = 6306048, start = 0
Without DMA you will see high CPU load from accessing the disks, regardless of
free space.
