The fundamental problem is that it should say
	wait_for_mm_progress();
	goto try_again;
and we dont have that facility right now. At that point the looping on
failed allocations problem is ok as we will allow someone to make progress.
That leaves the bounce buffers for > 800Mb RAM which currently are seriously
horked and will loop and may even stack overflow by inspection
