Hi. Just had a strange thing happen to my main machine today. 
It had been happily running 2.2.0-pre9, and then for some unknown
reason I noticed that the load was climbing into the sky...
Lots and lots of things were getting into " D " (disk wait) state, and 
not coming back. It looked like anything that tried to exit, was just
not doing so. I quit my netscape and it just sat there in "D" and
wouldn't free up it's memory. 
I tried a 'swapoff -a' and then 'swapon -a', but that didn't change
anything. (It did work tho...swapped everyhing back in ok)
At this point the load was up to about 100 or so. The machine was
still very responsive, it was just all the disk waiting that was
making the load climb. Anything that did an exec was likely to get
stuck in disk land, I tried a 'sync' in one window and it never came
back. I had to use alt-sysrq-b to reboot. 
I saved off a demsg output (that had some interesting stuff in it),
but after I rebooted, all the files I had made got nuked by fsck. ;(
I did copy down by hand some alt+sysrq output:
alt-sysrq-p:

alt-sysrq-s didn't appear to sync the disks. I didn't hear any
activity, and filesystems came up dirty. alt-sysrq-u also didn't
appear to do anything. 
I saved off a dmesg and some ps listings, and then rebooted. 
On bootup fsck nuked all the files I had created, so I don't have that 
data anymore. ;(
syslogd was one of the first to get locked in D state, so nothing in
the logs. ;(
Hopefully this is helpfull to someone. I can lookup stuff in my system 
map if anyone thinks it's usefull to do so. Perhaps something not
giving up a filesystem lock? 
I am running 2.2.0-pre9 again, so if this happens again, what usefull
info can I get?
