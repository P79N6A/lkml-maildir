If the device is modularised, you should be able to put something like:
post-install my_driver /usr/sbin/load_firmware
in /etc/conf.modules.  The problems there are:
1. I don't know whether the call to open() will continue once the driver
   is loaded, or once modprobe has finished doing its thing,
2. It only works if the driver is modularised
Personally, I'd put the firmware in the driver and fight for the inclusion
of the patches which make __init{func,data} work for modules :)
