probably coloring effects, yes. Another reason could be that 
touch_cache() touches 6 separate areas of memory, which combined with 
the stack give a minimum of 7 hugepage TLBs. How many are there in these 
Xeons? If there are say 4 of them then we could be trashing these TLB 
entries. There are much more 4K TLBs. To reduce the number of TLBs
utilized, could you change touch_cache() to do something like:
        unsigned long size = __size/sizeof(long), chunk1 = size/2;
        unsigned long *cache = __cache;
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < size/4; i += 8) {
                switch (i % 4) {
                        case 0: cache[i]++;
                        case 1: cache[size-1-i]++;
                        case 2: cache[chunk1-i]++;
                        case 3: cache[chunk1+i]++;
                }
        }
does this change the migration-cost values? Btw., how did you determine 
the value of the 'ideal' migration cost? Was this based on the database 
benchmark measurements?
There are a couple of reasons vmalloc() is better than gfp(): 1) it has 
no size limit in the measured range, and 2) it more accurately mimics 
migration costs of userspace apps, which typically have most of their 
cache-footprint in paged memory, not in hugepage memory.
