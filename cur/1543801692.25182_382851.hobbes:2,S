Hi Jeff.
Upgraded a DEC Multia to 2.6 today and noticed its 21040 was split off 
into the "de2104x" driver. Also see it's marked "experimental" and just 
wanted to report that it seems to be working fine on the 21040 as found 
in a DEC Multia (Pentium variant):
00:08.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21040 
[Tulip] (rev 23)
         Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- 
ParErr- Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B-
         Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium 
 >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
