  EFI firmware no     no     RBC   Apple Mac mini x86 in target mode ³
¹) As mentioned, with firmware from MacPower.
²) Same firmware_revision as with Tino's disk, i.e. apparently firmware
   from Prolific.  Same findings as Tino's:
   "sg_start --stop" is accepted but does not stop the motor.
   "sg_start --pc=3" or "=2" stop the motor.
   "sg_start --pc=1" or a read command restarts the motor.
   "sg_start" does not restart the motor.
³) "sg_start --stop" is accepted but does not stop the motor.
   "sg_start --pc=3" or "=1" fails with "invalid field in cdb".
   This is of course against the spec, because RBC includes power
   condition.
Moreover, when OS X shuts down, it apparently sends START STOP UNIT
without power condition to FireWire disks.  Therefore we also should
rather _not_ use power condition per default.
I will send a patch which uses the power condition field only for
PL-3507 and DViCO CX-1.
