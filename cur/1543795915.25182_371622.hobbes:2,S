I have an excessively new system for which 2.6.12 kernel in the Debian
etch beta 1 installer doesn't detect the hard drive.
Intel D945PSNLK Motherboard
WD25000JS-OOM, which Western Digital's site says is a 2nd generation
SATA.
Pentium 4 630 processor.
Intel provides drivers for this motherboard, but they only seem to
concern the on-board audio and LAN.  I'm not sure if the problem is
the m/b or the disk, or the combination.  Win2K managed to see the
drive, so the hardware is OK.
dmesg shows IHC7:
ICH7: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:1f.1
ICH7: chipset revision 1
ICH7: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
  ide0: BM-DMA at 0x30b0-0x30b7, BIOST settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
Unfortunately, the thing at IDE0 is the DVD.
manually loading the ahci driver doesn't work.  An earlier thread with
a somewhat similar problem advised doing this to see what the messages
were, but nothing useful showed up (modprove -v ahci).
The installer doesn't seem to have lspci.
I've tried ATA/IDE mode as enhanced and legacy in the BIOS; neither
works.
Any suggestions?
I would appreciate if you cc'd me.
Thanks.
