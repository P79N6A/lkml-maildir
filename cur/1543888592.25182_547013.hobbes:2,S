you got the history wrong i think: the first version of lockdep was 
released to lkml a year ago (May 2006), while the first time you 
mentioned your lock contention patch was November 2006 and you released 
it to lkml in December 2006 - so it was _you_ who was "replicating the 
same work", not lockdep :-) And this was pointed out to you very early 
on, many months ago.
and regarding C99 style lock initializers: the -rt project has been 
removing a whole heap of them in the past 2.5 years, since Oct 2004 or 
so, and regularly cleansed the upstream kernel for old-style 
initializers ever since then - so i'm not sure what you are referring 
to.

btw., you dont even need CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO to get usable symbol names, 
CONFIG_KALLSYMS alone will do it too. (It's only if you really cannot 
tell from the lock symbol name and the function name what the entry is 
about - which is very rare - that you need to look at any debug-info)
