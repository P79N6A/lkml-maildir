For a program which uses a lot of heap and doesn't fork, that sounds
reasonable.

Yes.  I don't know the movnta instruction, but surely, whatever scheme
is used, there has to be a snoop for every cache line's worth of
memory that is zeroed.
The other point is that having the page hot in the cache may well be a
benefit to the program.  Using any sort of cache-bypassing zeroing
might not actually make things faster, when the user time as well as
the system time is taken into account.

It is the average elapsed time in clear_page, so it would include the
writeback of any cache lines displaced by the zeroing, but not the
writeback of the newly-zeroed cache lines (which we hope will be
modified by the program before they get written back anyway).
This is using the dcbz (data cache block zero) instruction, which
establishes a cache line in modified state with zero contents without
any memory traffic other than a cache line kill transaction sent to
the other CPUs and possible writeback of a dirty cache line displaced
by the newly-zeroed cache line.  The new cache line is established in
the L2 cache, because the L1 is write-through on the G5, and all
stores and dcbz instructions have to go to the L2 cache.
Thus, on the G5 (and POWER4, which is similar) I don't think there
will be much if any benefit from having pre-zeroed cache-cold pages.
We can establish the zero lines in cache much faster using dcbz than
we can by reading them in from main memory.  If the program uses only
a few cache lines out of each new page, then reading them from memory
might be faster, but that seems unlikely.
