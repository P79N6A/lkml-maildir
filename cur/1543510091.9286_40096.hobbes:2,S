You clearly miss the point, Linux _has_ _real_ device drivers.
Device drivers seperated from the kernel are not more real than the
ones we have now. In fact they have a lot of bad effects which means
that people insisting on standalone drivers will have to face the
music on their own.
Splitting off subsystems has many ill effects, such as:
1) A bug is often present in more than one driver, when you fix one
   you can often fix a pile of drivers at the same time.
2) If a kernel structure is modified, the person who changes this can
   fix all references to the structure. Yes this happens and it is
   something we want to happen.
3) Drivers get out of sync with the main tree because the maintainer
   is too busy for whatever reason.
