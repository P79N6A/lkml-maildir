That's right, since jfs doesn't need the helper and your patch was a
full and complete fix. I should have clarified whether that was how
you wanted it handled, sorry.
Which reminds me, I need to follow up about the original befs and 9p
patches which didn't make it to the list and haven't been ACKed or
NAKed yet...
