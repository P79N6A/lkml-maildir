Hi,
I'm ptraceing a child process and I'd like to take a peek at memory
pointed to by a seg:offs far pointer.  Assuming seg is normal userspace DS
then the ptrace(PEEKDATA,..) works fine.  If not then I must most likely
perform conversion to linear address by hand.  However for this I need to
get at the code16/32, address16/32, base, limit, etc info of the segment
descriptor for this (given) segment.  Obviously this data can be read from
the GDT/LDT.  Unfortunately I can't figure out how to get at this without
having to patch the traced program code with support routines for exactly
this purpose and then undoing this and continuing.
Thanks,
MaZe.
