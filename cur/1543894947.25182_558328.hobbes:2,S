Wow, that really needs to be put somewhere in 120 point red blinking
text.  A lot of us are used to uninitialized disks calculating the
parity-on-first-write, but if linux MD is forgoeing that
'dangerous-no-resync' sounds really REALLY bad.  How about at least a
'Warning: unlike other systems this WILL cause corruption if you
forego reconstruction' on mkraid?
