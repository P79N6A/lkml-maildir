Hi,
  I am trying to install RedHat linux V 5.2 on a compaq machine , which has
SCSI hard disk ( Vendor : MICROP Model : 4110-09TBCU0322J) . I built the 
kernel 2.0.36 from the sources downloaded from www.kernel.org. It seems i 
didn't include the right SCSI driver. It is reporting that SCSI device not 
found ( at the end , kernel panic : unable to mount root fs). Please tell me 
which is driver to be included. If that is not part of the distribution , 
Please tell me where from i can get the driver.
   I am new to Linux, so please explain me in the most detailed way 
possible.
Thanks,
Manoj
