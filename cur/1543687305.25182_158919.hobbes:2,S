Have you tried adjusting the fan divisors (fan_div* in 
/sys/bus/i2c/devices/*)? Keep multiplying the fan divisor by two, and 
check the fan_input* devices-- you may have slow fans (or divide-by-two 
speed sensors), and you might need a longer sampling interval to see the 
lower speed.
Another option is to start the Windows monitoring program, perform a 
warm reboot into Linux, and use i2cdump to see how they configured the 
registers. Be sure to prevent your i2c drivers from loading, as a number 
of them initialize the chips to default settings.
