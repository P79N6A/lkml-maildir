Um, last time I checked we could still run some *minix* binaries from
before Linux was born, and we still can run statically linked a.out
programs created over a decade ago.  I don't think this is a serious
objection, given that historically the Linux kernel/userspace syscall
interface has been quite stable.  
Of course, I'd recomend against said driver using sysfs, but Greg K-H
tells us that all breakagaes are the fault of buggy device drivers
(just as supposedly all swsuspend problems are also about buggy device
drivers), so I guess we're OK.  :-)
