It depends on how do_some_stuff() was declared. If its declared as
   do_some_stuff (struct foo &x)
then it will be a pass by reference.

Think of it as "syntactic sugar": the compiler "does the right thing"
without all the grungy extra markup such as __atribute. 
(Remember that at the dawn of time, C++ was just a bunch of pre-processor
markup that did nothing but hide grunge like __attribute__((whatever))
from the programmer. Only later did it become a language. Doing markup
like what you're suggesting is only a tiny step away from inventing a new
language, esp if you come up with some clever, unobtrusive markup for
it.)

Well, this misses the point. No one intentionally passes null pointers.
Its just that "shit happens". Pass-by-reference changes your coding
style. You tend to alloc on stack instead of malloc.  And then, since
its on stack, you know it would be very wrong to keep a pointer to it, 
and so you don't, you design code differently.  Usually, you discover 
you never really needed to hold a pointer to it anyway; you just did so
out of some ingrained habit.
And since its on stack, you can't leak memory, you don't need to 
reference count it. Much fewer mallocs & frees, so less likely to have
errors there. Better performance, and less memory fragmentation, for
what that's worth.
I dunno, I did this once on a larger, year-long project, and rather
liked it (I otherwise don't much like C++, since people tend to use
it in bad, horrible ways). I won't say this is the greatest 
coding style in the world, but it does change the way you think about 
designing code, mostly for the better.
