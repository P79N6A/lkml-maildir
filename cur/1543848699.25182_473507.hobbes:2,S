I am personally not interested in making intrusive kernel changes even 
if it yields in true "single-system image". I want very small changes 
(preferrably none).

We also have transport abstraction layer and transport plugins for 
TCP/IP, SDP (Infiniband and possibly others), and SCI (Dolphin).

Nopage will be called if there is no pte. That means, with just nopage 
you cannot implement RO-RW transition. If you use nopage only, you 
cannot have multiple readers, because you cannot invalidate all other 
readers if one reader goes read-write. Thus nopage allows single reader 
or single writer whle the page fault hook allows multiple readers and 
single writer.
