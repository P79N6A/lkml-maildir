I'm using 2.4.3 vanilla with aic7xxx (aic7880 onboard)
I set the max # of TCQ commands per device setting to 50..what's a really
good setting for this, just the default of 253?
In /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/0 i see for my drives these numbers:
	Commands Queued 140000
	Commands Active 0
	Command Openings 253
	Max Tagged Openings 253
and the Queued number keeps increasing, never decreasing. is it supposed
to do this? 
Sometimes Commands Active is at 50, but mostly 0
Thanx,
-Tony
