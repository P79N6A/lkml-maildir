Thx for your reply.
Actually i want to use wireless LAN in my embedded linux, i would like 
to use Philip BGW200 WLAN chip as the wireless module. Except the 
adapter for this module , do i need to download and plug-in WLAN stack 
to the kernel or i can just choose to support wlan simply in the 
menuconfig ?
Hope somebody can give me a hand.
Regards,
TOM
