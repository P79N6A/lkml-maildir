Hi,
[whoa, maybe I shouldn't have used such an inflammatory subject,
the mail volume would suggest that ;-)]

Darn right. Intel has been having thermal protection for a somewhat longer
time, but Athlon had serious issues with missing or incompletely functioning
thermal sensors on many not too outdated (let's say it was 4 years ago, ok?)
motherboard/CPU combos.
And I don't really want to know about thermal protection status of various
Cyrix, VIA or even Winchip CPUs (you've been a nic^H^Hïve believer of
competition in a healthy marketplace and bought some of those, right?
I know I did... ;).
But since Pavel's blog mentions that thermal protection is an ACPI
specification, there's hope that it may actually work half-decently
after all.
