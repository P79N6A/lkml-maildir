I don't agree with this.  If you don't have documentation, you
only know what the code does, not what it's supposed to do.
This means not only does it become harder to understand things,
it also becomes much harder to verify that the code is doing
the right thing.

On the contrary.  I have found that updating the documentation
of a function before fixing the code helps to keep me focussed
on letting this function do the exact right thing.
Working the other way around often leads to the "wait a moment,
shouldn't I catch this special case ??" thing and at times to
spagetti code.
Writing the documentation first makes it easier to realise that
some functionality doesn't belong in a function and needs to be
abstracted out, which I'm doing at a nice rate in the -rmap VM.

Just download the -rmap patch and start reading.
It's not _that_ hard ;)
cheers,
