Subject: What exactly is __ALIGN_STR in pnpbios/bioscalls.c for?

Hi,
include/linux/linkage.h in kernel 2.6 includes #define's for __ALIGN and 
__ALIGN_STR. In include/asm-i386/linkage.h, their values are changed 
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_ALIGNMENT_16.
It isn't obvious what exacly CONFIG_X86_ALIGNMENT_16 is for (I've heard 
more than one opinion), and since the __ALIGN_STR usage in 
drivers/pnp/pnpbios/bioscalls.c is the only non-m68k usage of one of 
these two #define's I wonder whether you might be able to enlighten me 
what CONFIG_X86_ALIGNMENT_16 exactly is for?
TIA
Adrian
