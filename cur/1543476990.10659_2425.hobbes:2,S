Sure. If somebody moves the directory without telling you, you're in
trouble. 
But that's exactly the same issue as caching data on the client - you'd
agree that it's a requirement for any sane network filesystem, no? What's
so different about meta-data? The same way you have "this file has
changed" messages, you could have "this file has moved". Makes sense..
Using file handles makes the screwage much less obvious - you end up with
"stale filehandle" errors and other nice issues. At least using a name
makes the problem understandable.

If it doesn't work for some filesystems, that makes me suspect that the
whole idea is bogus. Sure, we can have special case interfaces, but if you
want those, you should already love WNT, right?
Basically "open_by_handle()" is not a generic solution, and _that_ is my
gripe.
