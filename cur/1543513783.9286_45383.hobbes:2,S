Haven't had a chance to dig into these too much yet, but
here's a couple problems I had:
1) setting CONFIG_X86_FX=y resulted in a link time
   error (unresolved symbol __buggy_fxsr_alignment from
   line 85 in include/asm-i386/bugs.h) which looks
   intentional - why it happened on my system I don't
   know... Looks like it's code that's intended to
   be optimized out if certain conditions apply; but
   it wasn't optimized out on my box (maybe due to
   the use of pgcc -O6 -Os?).
2) after I got the kernel built successfully with
   CONFIG_X86_CPU_OPTIMIZATIONS=y, trying to rebuild
   the VMware modules failed - compiles are ok, but
   the insmod step results in an undefined symbol
   best_memset - maybe someone forgot to export a
   symbol somewhere? Could also be a VMWare problem,
   so I'll pursue that route as well. Problem disappeared
   when I set CONFIG_X86_CPU_OPTIMIZATIONS=n.
System info:
	Pentium II (Deschutes)
	128MB
	RedHat 6.0 base originally
	pgcc 2.95.1
Any input you can provide would be appreciated. Don't
hesitate to ask if you need further info...
