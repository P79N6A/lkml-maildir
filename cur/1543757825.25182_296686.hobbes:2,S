Subject: Slightly OT: We should move linux related channels off of FreeNode

Today lilo (the FreeNode network owner) has decided to make one step away in a 
direction opposite of freedom, and banned all Tor users from the FreeNode 
network.
Tor ( 
http://tor.eff.org
 ) is an open source anonymous gateway system. Many 
users who are not in the position to be able to use IRC otherwise (such as 
those who live in countries who do not believe in free speech) now cannot use 
Freenode any longer.
Do we want to use an IRC network that no longer supports freedom? Our only 
option is to move to another network, such as irc.noderebellion.net or 
irc.oftc.net. Channels such as #kernelnewbies have already moved to oftc due 
to lilo's past actions.
