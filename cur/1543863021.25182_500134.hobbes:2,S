I have exactly the same problem on -rc5 and it causes all I/O to stall 
periodically if I do _anything_ I/O intensive.
On my box, I have 4 sata_nv handled SATA ports, with two pairs of different 
drives (two Maxtor, two WD) and it happens randomly on both. So it's 
absolutely nothing to do with the drive make/model.
I'll try Jeff's suggestion of disabling ADMA now, but I think something more 
radical than this workaround should make it into 2.6.20 final, otherwise a 
lot of people are going to have broken boxes.
