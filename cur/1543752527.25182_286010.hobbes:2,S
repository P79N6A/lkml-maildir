yes; the "normal" risk is time limited, eg the kernel will wait at most 30
seconds before writing back your dirty data, 5 seconds for ext3 actually.
With the "RT-abuse" hang, this 30 second thing goes on hold (because it's
done from those kernel threads that cause you those hickups in sound :-) and
you can starve a far longer period of time.. which may well mean a far
larger dataset not hitting the disk.
