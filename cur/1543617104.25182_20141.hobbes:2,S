Yeah, what Dave said.  Eric, your approach is pushing Aunt Tillie towards
more variations and what the Aunt Tillie needs is less.   Ditto for the
distro vendors.  They want as few as possible different kernels running
out there, the more variations there the greater the support load.  It's
the *opposite* of what the Linux kernel community wants, they want the 
broadest coverage of combinations they can get, that shows up more bugs.
If a distro vendor could get away with exactly one kernel config, they
would.  Even if it made for a 20MB kernel image, the support tradeoff 
is a win.
Supporting products for Aunt Tillie is very different than supporting
products for a bunch of hackers.  One wants "it works" and the other
wants "the source".
