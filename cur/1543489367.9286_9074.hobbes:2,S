G'day all,
I just tried 2.2.3 and it seems to be fine except that after a little
while some processes stop. ps says that they are now zombie processes.
If i do a ps axl, it turns out that all the hung processes have a 'WCHAN'
of 'wait4'.
This happened with a bunch of gcc's while trying to compile the kernel
with a make -j 20, where the load went upto 30. But it also happened when
running x11amp, where the load is only 0.5.
Cheers Mof.
