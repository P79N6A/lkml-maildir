Subject: 2.4.21-rc1 freezes caused by rtc driver?

The hangs/freezes that has been reported with 2.4.21-rc1 seems to be due 
to the changes to the rtc driver. At least on my Athlon/Ali Aladdin IV 
Laptop. I haven't backed out the changes to the drivers between 
2.4.21-pre7 and rc1 yet, but I've had no further problems after I 
disabled the rtc. (Or before 2.4.21-rc1). Cheers,
/Chris
