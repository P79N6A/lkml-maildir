Note that Linux-2.6.10 PCI code will report the __wrong__ IRQ
unless pci_enable_device() is executed first! Hopefully, there
may be an additional callable procedure in the future that
sets up the IRQ routing independent of actually enabling the
device. In the meantime, enable the device before you believe
dev->irq.
