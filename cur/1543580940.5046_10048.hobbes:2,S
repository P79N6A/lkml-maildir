/dev is mounted at boot time by the kernel (CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT=y).
The system boots and runs without devfsd. You just can't start any 
process calling for non-existing device under /dev and not created
by devfsd. For instance pppd or mc won't start by lack of pseudo-tty 
esd needs /dev/dsp ...
i was thinking the trouble may come from some programme launched by
your boot scripts before devfsd is running.
is your version of fileutils > 4.0.28 (ls --version) ?
