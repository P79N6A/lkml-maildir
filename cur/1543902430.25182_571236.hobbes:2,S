Theoretically, not correct. VBE 3.0 allows arbitrary mode setting - not 
only vertical refresh, but all mode parameters (the ones appearing in X 
modelines). This is supported by both svgalib and uvesafb. I don't know 
on how many VBE3 cards this feature really works, but it does work for 
some cards.
