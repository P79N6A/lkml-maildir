This looks wrong:
00000003 0.008ms (+0.001ms): dummy_socket_sock_rcv_skb (tcp_v4_rcv)
00000004 0.008ms (+0.000ms): tcp_v4_do_rcv (tcp_v4_rcv)
00000004 0.009ms (+0.000ms): tcp_rcv_established (tcp_v4_do_rcv)
00010004 3.998ms (+3.989ms): do_IRQ (tcp_rcv_established)
00010005 3.999ms (+0.000ms): mask_and_ack_8259A (do_IRQ)
00010005 4.001ms (+0.002ms): generic_redirect_hardirq (do_IRQ)
00010004 4.002ms (+0.000ms): generic_handle_IRQ_event (do_IRQ)
