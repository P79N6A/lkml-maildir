Same comment as on ''crypto: convert "crypto" subdirectory to UTF-8'':
Aren't we using ASCII for C sources?
BTW, the file names in the patch description are redundant.  A diffstat
can always be generated by patch handling tools and SCMs.  In case of
bigger patches which touch multiple files such as this, a diffstat on
top of the diff (but outside of the description, i.e. below a "---"
delimiter line) should be provided when the patch is posted to
mailinglists, so that the extent of the patch can be quickly assessed
when reading the mails.
