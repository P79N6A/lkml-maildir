Thank you for taking the time to explain. The gcc -S option is a great
debugging tool, which I have just added to my debugging methods, Thank
you. 
I new there was a reason for the code being written in such a way. I am
glad I asked the question, as know I can actually write faster code.
Cheers Mof.
