If you are referring to Badram patch by Rick van Rein
(
http://rick.vanrein.org/linux/badram/
), it doesn't detect the bad ram,
memtest86 does that part (and does it well) -- you enter then enter the
badram clusters as boot param. But I have to say badram patch works
marvellously (thanks, Rick.) Shame it didn't find its way to standard
kernel.
