Yes.  Sorry on the unmodified ps the parent-child relationship
seems to be displayed properly.

I will keep it in mind.  A simple this process has been reparented
flag probably won't be too bad.   As for the rest I'm not certain.
With pid namespaces there is a certain sense in doing something like
this, but I'm not certain /sbin/init and all of it's replacements
don't care (although admittedly it would be a stretch to tell the
difference).
