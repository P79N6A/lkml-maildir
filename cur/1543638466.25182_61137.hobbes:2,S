Well that's fairly straightforward, thanks.  Butt-ugly though ;)
Don't bother doing teardown yet.  I have patches which batch
all the zap_page_range activity into 16-page chunks, so we
eventually end up in a single function with 16 virtually-contiguous
pages to release.  Adding the batched locking to that will
be simple.
Sigh.  I have a test which sends the 2.5.30 VM into a five-minute
coma and which immediately panics latest -ac with pte_chain oom.
Remind me again why all this is worth it?
I'll port your stuff to 2.5 over the weekend, let you know...
