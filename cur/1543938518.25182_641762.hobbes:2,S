I'm a little confused by your patch.
i386 already has srat parsing code (just written in a horrible hackish way); 
but it exists arch/x86/kernel/srat_32.c
That one tended to explode on Opteron, but apparently worked on some 
Summit boxes.
You're saying you want to remove that code and replace it based on something
based on the drivers/acpi/numa.c parsing code? While that's in theory
a worthy goal it will not actually help all that much because numa.c only
does some high level parsing, but nothing of the actual low level work
of setting things up.
