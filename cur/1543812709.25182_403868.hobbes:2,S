I'm sending this again because it looks like the original got lost.  At 
least, I've not seen it show up on the mailing list yet and I sent it 8

AFAIK, it is not yet supported by the sockets layer, and the glibc posix
aio apis do NOT use the kernel aio support.  I have done some
experimentation with it by hacking dd, but from what I can tell, it is
not used in any sort of production capacity.
