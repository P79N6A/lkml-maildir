The problem is, since 2.4.19-pre5 the elevator has changed to give more 
throughput but also introduce pauses and even stops while disk i/o.
Redhat's 2.4.18 is not 2.4.18 but something 2.4.19ish(-pre|-pre-ac or so).

There are some hacks. One by Andrea Arcangeli, one by Neil Schemenauer and one 
by Con Kolivas and me. Search the archives please (lowlat elevator/io 
scheduler)
