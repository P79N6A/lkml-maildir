What about:
1 (network domain). I have two network interfaces that I connect to 
two different network segments, eth0 & eth1; they're ifconfig'd to 
the appropriate IP and MAC addresses. I really do need to know 
physically which (physical) hole to plug my eth0 cable into. 
(Extension: same situation, but it's a firewall and I've got 12 ports 
to connect.) (Extension #2: if I add a NIC to the system and reboot, 
I'd really prefer that the NICs already in use didn't get renumbered.)
2 (disk domain). I have multiple spindles on multiple SCSI adapters. 
I want to allocate them to more than one RAID0/1/5 set, with the 
usual considerations of putting mirrors on different adapters, 
spreading my RAID5 drives optimally, ditto stripes. I need (eg) SCSI 
paths to config all this, and I further need real physical locations 
to identify failed drives that need to be hot-replaced. The mirror 
members will move around as drives are replaced and hot spares come 
into play.
Seems like more that merely informational.
(A side observation: PCI or SCSI bus/device/lun/etc paths are not 
physical locations; you also need external hardware-specific 
knowledge to be able to talk about real physical locations in a way 
that does the system operator any good.)
