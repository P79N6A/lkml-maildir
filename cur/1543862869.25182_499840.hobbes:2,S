I would like to do that, but I want to make sure that no userspace tools
are using this information.
But, as Matt Dobson is now gone off somewhere in Europe, not doing Linux
stuff anymore, he's not going to answer this.  So I'll just make up a
removal patch and let it sit in -mm for a while to see if anything
breaks.
I really only think the big NUMA boxes care about that information, if
anything.
