 I'm not on this list, so please respond directly to me for more info.
 I was running 2.4.0-12 (back to -10 now), K6-2 chip. With -12, the system
would hard-hang quite frequently. Complete lockup: no response to alt-sysrq,
so no info available. Eventually I figured out that this was only happening
when I was moving the mouse.
  I'm also running xfree-4, which may be related, but that shouldn't be able
to lock the system up completely.
