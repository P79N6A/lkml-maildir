Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: fix OF <-> PCI linkage for G5 AGP bus
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus !
This patch fixes the failure of radeonfb to retreive the clock
and EDID data from Open Firmware. The linkage between the PCI device
and the OF node couldn't be established properly at boot because of
the renumbering we do to the G5's AGP bus.
Please apply,
Ben.
