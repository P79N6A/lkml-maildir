Yep, looks wrong to me.

The underlying memory model of the CPU.  For sequentially consistent
systems, only compiler barriers are required.  There are very few such
systems -- MIPS and PA-RISC, if I remember correctly.  Performance
dictates otherwise.
I believe that MIPS is -not- sequentially consistent, but have not yet
purchased an architecture reference manual.

mb() needs to do everything that smp_mb() does, ditto for rmb() and
wmb().  There really are cases where both I/O and memory accesses
need to be ordered, so just providing separate memory ordering and
I/O ordering is not enough.
Given that ARM device drivers are accessing MMIO locations, which are
often slow anyway, how much is ARM really gaining by dropping memory
barriers when only I/O accesses need be ordered?  Is it measurable?
If not, there is no point in adding yet another set of combinatorial
choices to the memory-barrier API.
						Thanx, Paul
