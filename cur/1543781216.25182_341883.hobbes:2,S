Is the machine running X? We need some output from it so we can debug
what's going on, the info should be printed to the console. It would
be great if you could run the latest kernel and see if you get any
output. Also add nmi_watchdog=2 to the boot command line.
You can also set up a serial console or netconsole to capture the output
from the server with the help of another machine, described in
Documentation/serial-console.txt
Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt
