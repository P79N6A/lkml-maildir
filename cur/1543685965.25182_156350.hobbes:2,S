Hi, thanks for tracking down the problem
Can you send me: 
a dmesg with the patch (i.e. when it fails (essential))
a dmesg without the patch (i.e. when it succeeds)
the output of /proc/interrupts (when it fails (if possible)) 
the output of /proc/interrupts (when it succeeds) 
the output of /proc/acpi/dsdt
the output of lspci -vvv
(the last two can be either with or without the patch)
Sorry about the long list, but this is what I need to diagnose these problems.

Yeah, I know. My next patch is likely to have to do even more unfortunately. 
Found quite a number more issues with IRQs.
