i think it's incorrect in its current form, because 'pos' is not 
necessarily safe and might be removed from the commit_list?
the whole loop could be a "while (!list_empty(head))" thing, if it wasnt 
for the possibility for an nfs_set_page_writeback_locked() to skip an 
entry. Maybe a local list of 'already processed' requests should be 
built, and once the main list is emptied, moved back into the main list? 
Then the lock-break could be moved to the end of the loop.
