Right. As I wrote scsi_k(un)map_atomic_sg I did mention that they, 
probably, should go to a higher layer as they were not scsi-specific, but 
as I didn't have a good idea of where exactly to put them, I called them
scsi_* and put in scsi_lib.c. Suggestions for a better place and namespace 
for them very welcome. Or just feel free to move / rename them as you see 
appropriate. See, e.g., 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112345886816099&w=2 and the 
related thread from August last year for possible other potential users of 
this API.
Thanks
