I think this is a red herring, the chunk size code did accidentally
get backed out of CVS for a while.  But variable chunk sizes were
certainly going into the kernel when we did the development.

Absolutely sure.  Those figures were for a pair of PVs that were
sharing an IDE cable so I can certainly get things moving faster.

Excellent idea, we should probably think up some better benchmarks too.
