Before we invent a problem:
(i) Andreas sent the first 128 sectors of his /dev/hda3,
and they were all equal, with data that looked like
random garbage. Maybe something is terribly wrong with Linux,
but for the time being I suppose that this is just a random
test pattern written by the manufacturer, and that this /dev/hda3
has never been formatted.
(ii) You say potential problems start at 8 GB.
But Andreas' partition was just below 7 GB.
So, until Andreas comes back and protests that my interpretation
is all wrong, he does not have a problem.
On the other hand, if there really is a problem, reproducible
and verifiable, then it will probably be easy to fix.
(So, your detailed report is welcome.)
