Hello,
>so does anyone know of an available quad xeon motherboard?
>the emphasis is on motherboard, not built system
        Nope.  The 2 that I surely know of are the Intel SC450NX, and the
AMI Megaplex.  Both come with own enclosures.       
>also, does the board require s special enclosure?
        Yes.  3 things are of essence:
        a) Height(if rackmount), or depth(if stand-alone).  I'm sure you've
seen the Xeons so you will understand.
        b) The base-board that the motherboard rests on should have extra
holes for the CPU to be screwed in.  You don't want the CPUs hanging off of
the motherboard alone.
        c) Cooling, air-flow.
        That is why Intel, AMI sell only whole kits, I guess.
        One more thing.  If you plan on getting 2 CPUs installed with the
plan of installing 2 later, please let your vendor know that you will be
using the CPUs as a quad system eventually(unless you buy the board/system
from him too, in which he/she should know).  There are different stepping
CPUs for quad and dual systems.
        Dual-Xeon boards are available.  We have found that dual-Xeon boards
with U2-SCSI disks can be quite a performance-boost.
        :-)
YMMV,
Kedar.
Take care,
Kedar Rajadnya.
