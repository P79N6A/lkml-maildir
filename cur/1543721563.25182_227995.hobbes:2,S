Please divert some of your anger towards your manufacturer of dodgy
hardware. Any sane hardware with an IOMMU handles this just fine.
eg on ppc64 running a disk test:
sg size    in        out
1           3      47569
2           0       2591
3           0       1123
4           0        447
5           0        429
...
62       5095          0
64      47061          0
The IOMMU is taking 62-64 entry SG lists and producing 1-5 entry lists.
