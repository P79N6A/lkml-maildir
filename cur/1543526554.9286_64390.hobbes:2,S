I will add my comments too: ;-)
Why sticking with inlining for this stuff? Getting rid of inlining does
insure this stuff be aligned in everything the same way and would likely
fix the problem forever. Fixing it in memory would not affect precision
for micro-second even on early alpha machines, in my opinion, given clock
frequencies used on alpha since years. 
The udelay stuff is designed to waste deterministic amounts of time and
some minimal precision requirement should be specified. Otherwise it is 
just usable at nothing good.
