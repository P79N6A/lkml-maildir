Subject: [patch 10/45] Reduce ACPI verbosity on null handle condition
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
As detailed at 
http://bugs.gentoo.org/131534
 :
2.6.16 converted many ACPI debug messages into error or warning 
messages. One extraneous message was incorrectly converted, resulting in 
logs being flooded by "Handle is NULL and Pathname is relative" messages 
on some systems.
This patch (part of a larger ACPICA commit) converts the message back to 
debug level.
