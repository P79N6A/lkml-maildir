->remount_fs() certainly can refuse to go r/w - you don't need anything
new for that, just don't leave MS_RDONLY in *flags.  The real trouble
starts when fs wants to go r/o on its own, e.g. when it sees an error
bad enough to warrant that.  And that, BTW, is very likely to require
more than just one bit in ->policy - we want all IO on that device
to fail until after we actually close it during umount.  As it is,
we can get anything, including block allocations (e.g. if we have
a dirty mapping and it gets written to disk).  OTOH, we don't want
it to be the same thing as genuine hardware readonly - when buggered
fs is umounted, we are very likely to do fsck on it, after all.
