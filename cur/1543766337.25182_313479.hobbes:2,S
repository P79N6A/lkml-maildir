NO.
Guys, I will say this once more: git will not look at the signature.
That means that we don't "strip them off", because dammit, they DO NOT 
EXIST as far as git is concerned. This is why a tag-file will _always_ 
start with 
	commit <commit-sha1>
	tag <tag-name>
because that way we can use fsck and validate reachability and have things 
that want trees (or commits) take tag-files instead, and git will 
automatically look up the associated tree/commit. And it will do so 
_without_ having to understand about signing, since signing is for trust 
between _people_ not for git.
And that is why I from the very beginning tried to make ti very clear that
the signature goes at the end. Not at the beginning, not in the middle,
and not in a different file. IT GOES AT THE END.
