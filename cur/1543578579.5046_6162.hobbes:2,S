I am inclined to believe it IS a hardware problem... If disable_irq were buggy,
wouldn't the problem occur more frequently in other irq-heavy areas? A quick
count shows that disable_irq* is used in 84 sourcefiles in the driver/*
directory. This includes drivers which generate many interrupts in a short
timeframe (like ide).
