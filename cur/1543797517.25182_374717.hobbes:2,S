The RTC count is lost on a hard reset.  It survives sleep mode though.
The fact is that PocketPC/WinCE is not meant to be "rebooted" and the 
RTC on the PXA was probably designed with that fact.  The normal usage 
pattern is to go into sleep mode all the time.

I'd say so.

You should be able to "soft" reboot which will also preserve the RTC 
count.
