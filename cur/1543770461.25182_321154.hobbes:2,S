As per Bartlomiej, I've not applied this, since the "don't do it unless
you've written to it" fix from Jens went in. I assume CD-RW's know how to
cache flush..
That said, it does sound like the capabilities bitmap should be changed
around to be the other way (either by starting at ~0, or, if the changes
aren't too invasive, just change the semantics of it to be the sane way
around ("drive can do this" rather than "drive can _not_ do this").
