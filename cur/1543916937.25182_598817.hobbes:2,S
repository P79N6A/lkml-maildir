How is the static kobject created by decl_subsys() getting it's release
function called when it is never really "released" as it is a static
kobject?
The "correct" way to fix this is to dynamically create the subsystem
kobject, and is what I am working toward accomplishing.  But I didn't
think it was necessary just yet.
Let me go dig some more...
