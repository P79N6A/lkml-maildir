doh!  it's a warning if something iffy happens (which so far for me it
hasn't) which explains why i missed it...  not sure why i didn't get a
build warning though...  thanks!

kill(..., SIGKILL) doesn't work to kill host-OS processes created in
the exec path in TT mode --- for this we need PTRACE_KILL (it did work
in previous kernels, but not by design).  Without this process will
accumulate on the host-OS (although the won't be visible inside UML).
