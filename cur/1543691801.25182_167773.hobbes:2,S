I've been missing keypresses for at least six weeks; at first I too
thought the keyboard was the culprit, but I've anecdotal grumblings in
email from several 2.4 users who thought the same of their own machines.
Not very likely to be a keyboard-infesting virus out there... 
Frequency seems to be of the order of 0.001 on average.
It might not be only keyboard interrupts that are being missed, but I
have no hard data -- just a gut feeling that occasional ethernet
packets are going astray too for no known good reason.  Hasn't been
enough of a problem to trigger serious investigation.
