The results is still the same, so I download the latest ac12 and give it a
try --> same.
first observation:
I try to ping to other computer and the results is as follows ;
64 bytes from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : icmp_seq_4 ttl=255 time =1000.559
64 bytes from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : icmp_seq_4 ttl=255 time =2000.939
64 bytes from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : icmp_seq_4 ttl=255 time =1.066
64 bytes from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : icmp_seq_4 ttl=255 time =0.59
64 bytes from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : icmp_seq_4 ttl=255 time =0.587
64 bytes from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : icmp_seq_4 ttl=255 time =0.574
64 bytes from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : icmp_seq_4 ttl=255 time =0.616
64 bytes from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : icmp_seq_4 ttl=255 time =0.717
and it dies off.
I do not know what actually happens to the first 2 response and why it dies
off.
after the incident , external computer are still unreachable.
could it be the tcp changes in ac10 and ac11.
I would try out ac8 and ac9 and get back to you because I just fallback to
gcc 2.7.2.3 as it seems that the ac series does not compile well with egcs.
( it refuse to compile ac8 for me)
