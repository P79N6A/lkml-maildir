This makes things consistent -- but in the opposite way
from what I thought they might be.  (The alternative would of 
course have been to make POLLRDHUP un-maskable in both epoll 
and poll().)
So I'm curious: what is the rationale for making POLLRDHUP 
maskable when POLLHUP is not?   Is it an issue of ABI 
compatibility; or something else?
Cheers,
Michael
