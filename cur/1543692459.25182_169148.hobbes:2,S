FWIW: I used to have a similar board (Asus P5A, it actually died a week
ago, so I can't check anything anymore). Never tried 2.6 on it, but I
know it had a flakey PnPBIOS implementation: if you put in a Sound
Blaster AWE64 Gold, you couldn't use the floppy drive anymore. The
latest "Y2K compliant" BIOS (revision 1.005 IIRC) fixed that, it might
also fix this particular bug.
(Asus website seems to be broken, I get a "runtime error" from their
web server when I want to get a list of downloads, so I have no idea if
you have the latest BIOS right now :-/ )
