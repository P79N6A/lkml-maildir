Suggestion: try the testcase that Satoru Takeuch posted.  The numbers I
got with latest SD were no better than the numbers I got with the patch
I posted to try to solve it.  Seems to me the numbers with SD should
have been much better, but they in fact were not.
Running that thing, mainline's GUI was not usable, even with my patch,
but neither was it usable with SD.  What's the difference between
horrible with mainline and merely terrible with SD?  In both, the GUI
ends up doing round-robin with a slew of hogs.  In mainline, this
happens because the history logic can and does get it wrong sometimes,
which this exploit deliberately triggers.  With SD, it's by design.
