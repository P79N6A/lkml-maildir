"This isn't really a problem" is a good analysis of the
situation, since 2.4.14/15 often have data duplicated
in both swap and RAM, so being 3MB into swap doesn't mean
3MB of your programs isn't in RAM.
If you take a look at /proc/meminfo, you'll find a field
called "SwapCached:", which tells you exactly how much
of your memory is duplicated in both swap and RAM.

Rik
