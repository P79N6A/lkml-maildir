I suspect you don't mean 'everybody'.
So who do you mean?
Why isn't there some advice on www.kernel.org that says:
  Do you use the Linux kernel?
  _You_ can make it better!!
  Here's how you can help...
and goes on to tell people how, depending on their familiarity and 
risk-aversion/linux-love ratio, they can install -mm kernels or -ck ones 
or -rc ones or -pre ones...
and it explains clearly what the intent and promises around each one are
and it explains the risks (probably in terms of likelihood of losing 
their digital photos!)
and it tells them how to subscribe to linux-kernel-announce
So they don't have to monitor lkml to know about them.
Maybe people like Horst could publicise the way in which they 
automatically download and deploy kernels.
I certainly wouldn't mind rebooting my desktop once a week to try a 
current kernel.
