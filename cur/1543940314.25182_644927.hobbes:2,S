May be I'm completely off the mark here, but shouldn't a small subset
of this section simply be 'breakpoint-free' rather than 'kprobe-free'?
Placing a breakpoint on kprobe_handler (say) can loop into a recursive
trap without allowing the debugger's notifier chain to be invoked. I'm
assuming that non-kprobe exception notifiers may (or even should) run
after kprobe's notifier callback (kprobe_exceptions_notify).

This will still happen. It doesn't stop non-kprobe breakpoints from
being handled, wherever they may be.

Here's what seems to be happening currently:
int3 (non-kprobe) -> do_int3 ->kprobe_exceptions_notify ->
kprobe_handler (passes the buck to the kernel) -> non-krpobe/debugger
exception handler.
Here's what the patch will do:
int3 (non-kprobe) -> do_int3 ->kprobe_exceptions_notify ->
WARN_ON/kprobe_handler -> non-kprobe/debugger exception handler.
The WARN_ON (and not a BUG_ON) will be hit iff:
(in_kprobes_functions(addr) && !is_jprobe_bkpt(addr))

I hope I've understood the point you were making, or at least came close :-).
