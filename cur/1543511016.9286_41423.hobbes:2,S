Hi,
I have an application that while trying to open /dev/audio
( open("/dev/audio",O_RDWR) ) blocks, takes all the CPU it can
and can't be killed.
I'm doing some bad stuff since I'm using the Creative Labs
Live sound card with their beta module on a 2.2.13pre14 SMP
kernel booted with the noapic option.
I just want to know if this completely justifies the
application behavior or if there is something else
to it.
Thanks,
Rui Sousa
