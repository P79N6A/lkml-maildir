Uptime is stored in jiffies which is 32bit on your arch, which results in 
an overflow after 2^32 clock ticks. TTTicks were 100 HZ till recently 
(overflow after 470 or so days) now, they're 1000 -> overflows after 45 
days.  Doesn't wreck anything except for uptime display - known problem, 
not worth the trouble fixing it would cause (64 bit values are 
non-atomic, unless MMX/SSE which isn't allowed in kernel) - however there 
is (if I'm not mistaken) a patch available wihich fixes this 'problem'.
However since it is only a matter of uptime display...
Cheers,
MaZe.
