Alan,
When we ported Oracle to NetWare, we found that making changes to the
core file systems in NetWare that Oracle needed would tank FS
performance, so we came up with something called direct FS, a separate
File System interface just for Oracle.  The SOSD layer inside of Oracle
allows them, via simple config statements, to redirect to different file
systems, even specialized ones, so this is trivial for them to
instrument.  The whole O_SYNC thing accross the entire OS could be
problematic to support.  
In NetWare, directFS was little more than a "raw" interface that
bypassed the file cache.  It would be like having an API to a direct
physical file system that never cached data in the buffer cache.  In
Linux, this may be tough to pull off, but Al Viro could instrument a
raw_read, raw_write function table entry that would do something
similiar that would allow Oracle to detect if an FS had a raw mode,
since this is what they actually need.
My 2 cents anyway.
