This mail pretty exactly says what I would say too! Even though I don't have a 
single core but an AMD X2 3400, Nforce 4 and NVIDIA Graphics card.

I would give SD a 9.5 on my system. With SD linux owns gaming ;-) I have never 
seen such smooth 3D animations before in my life!
CFS is good too. But on my system I can't really feel a large difference 
between CFS and mainline. I never had any real problems with mainline, except 
compiling a kernel (without nice) while playing enemy-territory. Currently I 
would clearly vote for SD, it works good as desktop and absolutely amazing 
as "gaming-load" scheduler.
p.s:
It would be nice if one could switch the schedulers in the kernel config, or 
even at runtime. Then you could simply switch schedulers while you stress the 
system and see the difference instantly without a reboot.
