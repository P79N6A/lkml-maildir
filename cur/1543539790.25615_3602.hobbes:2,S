It is not, because you have no business turning on "vender-unique"
and they show prevent the drive form accepting them unless told told and
pass-code checked.
Because this is what everyone was trying to pound im my head.
After thinking out their points.  There points stretched into a region
that needs to be addressed.
Since I am representing Linux on this committee, it is best that the
standard conform generic and not specific.  Thus this is a generic conform
request.
All the ATA-X means is that new drives must conform, and that drives that
are older general assumed to have died, IMHO.
