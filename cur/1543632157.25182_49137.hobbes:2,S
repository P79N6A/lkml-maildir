Could this be organized this way ?

Then for each model you would define its generic CONFIG_M<arch>, and
the specific features not contained in the generic. And then define
the rest of features based on generic.
The CONFIG_M<arch> would serve as a flag for 'this cpu has all features
of a generic xxx'.
Or if you are worried about namespace pollution these could be named
CONFIG_CPU_VENDOR_, CONFIG_CPU_, CONFIG_CPU_M.
BTW: any more stars in processor vendor/model sky ?
Comments awaited...
