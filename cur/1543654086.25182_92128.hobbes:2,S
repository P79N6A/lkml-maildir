   Did you also get some duplicated entries in /etc? I've had a
similar problem, with some files in /etc vanishing entirely, and
others being duplicated (so I got, for example, /etc/fstab appearing
twice in `ls /etc`). This has happened, as far as I can tell,
spontaneously -- no reboot, no run of fsck, not even any non-daemon
processes running other than X and an xterm. The machine wasn't being
used at all. Nothing turns up in the syslogs -- no oops, no bug,
nothing.
   Running fsck recovers the missing files into lost+found, but
doesn't remove the duplicated filenames. Duplicate files can be
deleted, but only one "filename" is removed, and the file then no
longer exists except to ls -- it shows up in `ls /etc`, but (e.g.)
`cat /etc/fstab` gives a "No such file or directory" error.

   I'm also using Debian testing with the same e2fsprogs. I saw the
effect on ext2, on a UP box.

   I remember seeing a comment about HTREE running past when I tried
the e2fsck for the first time. Don't know if this is relevant.
   I've seen this happen twice now -- both times requiring a day or so
of effort to recover the system configuration (it wasn't up for long
enough between times to do a system backup :( ). I can't afford any
more downtime on this machine for the next month or so, so I'm no
longer running ext2 on my root partition -- I moved to reiserfs in the
hope that it'll be more stable.
   Hugo.
