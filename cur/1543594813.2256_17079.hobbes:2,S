I found the problem...
IP_ALIAS is no longer needed in the config.  I screwed up the init script
configs for it so it did not work as expected.
The documentation does not reflect that the alias behaviour is on by
default.
I will submit a patch for the docs that reflects this so others will not
get confused by that.
