Surely the prefetch range has to depend on which direction the stack
grows.  For stacks that grow down, we want esp/ksp upwards,
prefetch_range(kernel_stack(next),
	MIN_KERNEL_STACK_FOOTPRINT + L1_CACHE_BYTES);
For stacks that grow up, we want esp/ksp downwards
prefetch_range(kernel_stack(next) - MIN_KERNEL_STACK_FOOTPRINT,
	MIN_KERNEL_STACK_FOOTPRINT + L1_CACHE_BYTES);
BTW, for ia64 you may as well prefetch pt_regs, that is also quite
large.
#define MIN_KERNEL_STACK_FOOTPRINT (IA64_SWITCH_STACK_SIZE + IA64_PT_REGS_SIZE)
