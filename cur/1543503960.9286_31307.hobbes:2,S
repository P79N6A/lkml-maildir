An ACL is weird because users expect their files to be kept securely,
so you have to be careful to propagate the ACL in "the right way". For
example, "tar -p". With other metadata you could imagine ways of
moving the data around that wouldn't always propagate the metadata.

I don't care. Look, this is a well known religious issue. All I'm
saying is that there is more than one opinion about this, and that
it's been argued for decades without resolution.
