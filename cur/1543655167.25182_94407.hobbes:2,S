Not always so.  I'm writing an app (userspace HIP, see www.hip4inter.net) 
that needs this too.  And it would be nice if there were a simple way to do 
it.  VoIP apps need this sometimes too.

Um. No, this isn't right.  The interface in question could be PPP, or 
something wierd like IP over FireWire, neither of which do ARP.  ARP is 
specifically for IPv4 over ethernet or something which emulates ethernet. 
IPv6 doesn't use ARP even on ethernet, yet source address selection is even 
more important in that case.  Nearly every IPv6 application will need to do 
it, or trust the kernel to do it right.  Random is not an option.
And applications *do not* necessarily work with any old address in the 
header; otherwise NAT would never be a problem.

This just describes the usual behaviour of unix-like systems.  But the most 
recently configured address would be just as correct a default.

You can select what you want this way, yes.  But there should be a way to 
select source addresses from among those already configured without having 
to have the ability to change the routing table or firewall rules!  Hence:

What's more, the specs actually say otherwise.  That's something you MUST 
be able to do (see the sockets API RFC).  And in IPv6 sometimes only the 
application can know what to do.
