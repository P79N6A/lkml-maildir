For the record, my cut-off for non-trivial stuff is currently about
1K. Which is more like 0.1% for minimal kernels. Unfortunately, the
impact of these patches on a stripped-down kernel is less substantial
than on a featureful one, so

I think both these patches deserve a spin in -mm. But I can see
arguments for staging it. Hopefully we can get Andrew to take the
unit-at-a-time piece for post-2.6.15 and try out the inlining after
we've got some confidence with the first.
