Subject: NFS incompatible with Solaris jumpstart

Hi,
I want to jumpstart-install (initial installation of the 
Solaris operating system) a sparc machine from a linux server
with kernel 2.6.8.1.
It works when using the nfs-user-server, but the sparc hangs after 
printing the OS prompt when using the nfs-kernel-server.
Any idea in how the nfs-user-server and the nfs-kernel-server differ 
and how to fix it?
regards
Hadmut
