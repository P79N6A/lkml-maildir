Subject: [PATCH] simple fs stop -ve dentries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

A tmpfs user reported increasingly slow directory reads when repeatedly
creating and unlinking in a mkstemp-like way.  The negative dentries
accumulate alarmingly (until memory pressure finally frees them), and
are just a hindrance to any in-memory filesystem.  simple_lookup set
d_op to arrange for negative dentries to be deleted immediately.
(But I failed to discover how it is that on-disk filesystems seem to
keep their negative dentries within manageable bounds: this effect was
gross with tmpfs or ramfs, but no problem at all with extN or reiser.)
