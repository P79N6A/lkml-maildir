Faults are predicted for each thread executing on a different processor.
So each processor does its own predictions which will not generate
preallocations on a different processor (unless the thread is moved to
another processor but that is a very special situation).

The origin of the pages has not changed and the existing locality
constraints are observed.
A patch like this is important for applications that allocate and preset
large amounts of memory on startup. It will drastically reduce the startup
times.
