I'm not entirely convinced these should be GPL-only exports.  Basically,
this is saying that any driver for a device that has this problem must be
GPLd.  I think that's a firmer stance than Linus had in mind originally.

Could you line up the \ so they're uniform like the above PCI_OP_READ?

Does this actually work?  Surely if you're reading byte 14, you get the
byte that was at address 12 or 15 in the config space, depending whether
you're on a big or little endian machine?

If we've done a write to config space while the adapter was blocked,
shouldn't we replay those accesses at this point?
