OK. From your letter I got the impression that you thought that this
keyboard required special hardware support. But the hardware is
handled fine, and you want to have a hook where a kernel module can
be called for given scan codes or key codes (or mouse events, ...).
In your case it is probably easiest to use setkeycodes to assign keycodes
to these keys, and put your hook at the keycode level.
