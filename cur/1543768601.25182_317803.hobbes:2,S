Subject: CONFIRMED bug in do_generic_file_read
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Well, my original post got ZERO responses, but I've continued to look 
at this, and with the help of a colleague I think we've bottomed out.
do_generic_file_read does indeed have a bug, as mentioned below. However, 
this bug is generally not hit as the call to a_ops->readpage (normally 
pointing at blkdev_readpage) NEVER returns an error. However, the Veritas 
code's readpage does return errors, and this triggers this KERNEL BUG.
I don't know enough about the page cache to know if simply NULLing the 
page->mapping pointer is safe.
Anyone care to address this?
thanks
