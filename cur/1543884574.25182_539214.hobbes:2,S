While I'm not fussed about the implementation details I agree with those
who have advocated a migration period where both stacks are present.  A
major change such as this is almost certain to turn up bugs when it becomes
more widely tested, and many firewire users are unlikely to test the
new stack without an easy fallback to a known working system.  Yes, I know
development and production systems should be separate, but I (and many
others) can't afford enough hardware for that.

Sounds reasonable to me.
However, as a compromise how about renaming the existing stack's modules and
then reusing the existing names for the new stack?  Messy I know, but this
way both stacks would still be available without recompilation for those who
needed them and the sbp2-as-root dilemma raised by Olaf would also be
covered.

My immediate thought it that it would be neater and clearer to have both
stacks in different directories, but I could live with either.
Oh yes, it would be nice to have working PCILynx support again (although I
acknowledge it's unlikely to happen).  Some of us do have these cards
installed for sniffing purposes (using nosy) but it would be nice to be able
to use them with libraw1394 as well.  It would for example save me having to
swap cards depending on what I needed to do (I have insufficient PCI slots
to have both the PCILynx and OHCI cards installed simultaneously).
