The S/390 has this; presumably it applies to Linux as well as the other
supported OSs?

ECC can be supported by the hardware; no support for mapping out duff
banks on x86, but again S/390 may differ?

Live SOFTWARE upgrade, or live HARDWARE upgrade? If the latter, things
like hotswap PCI, USB... and again the S/390?

Yes, I think so - mars_nwe surely needs this?

Isn't that how LVS clusters handle IP takeovers?

With one or two RFC violations, yes.
Basically, most of those features relating to hardware resilience should
be usable with Linux on an S/390 - they are hardware features, though,
AFAICS?
