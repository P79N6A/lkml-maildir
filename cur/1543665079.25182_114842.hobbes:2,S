I think this is not right so, doe to 2 reasons:
1st, i burned my finger on my bridge often enough that i should know that
its temperature varies, at least on some chips to really huge amounts ;-)
(on my new borad they dont even get hand warm)
2nd. the fact that the chip (or circuit) is on, doesnt mean that there flows current.
all halfway new microchips (including those bridges of course) are build in CMOS
or similar technology, meaning that there is no more static current flowing through
the transistors, but only capacity dependant current, when the transistors change
their state.
if no data flows, little transistors change their state
(only clock signals and some other idle work that is done),
and the output drivers to the bus systems are turned low.
so there is no static current on the bus and no dynamic current in the chip --> low overall current
--> low temperature
on the other hand if data flows, its being processed, and many transistors change their state with the data flow,
as do the output driver blocks --> high static and dynamic current --> high temperature.

than this would be measurable as an higher mainboard or system temperature,
which is not in our case, as described in the other mails
