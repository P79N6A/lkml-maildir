This is correct, when I removed the __devinit's the oops did not occur.
I see this has been fixed in akpm's 2.6.0-mm1 release :-)
Thanks,
Shawn.

It's got to be the e100-2.3.x driver in 2.6.0.

That's the problem.  __devinit's where there shouldn't be __devinit's.
So e100-3.0.x is pending in -exp queue for 2.6.1; do we fix 2.6.0?
