I sent Emanuele the attached patch during the weekend...

No, it's not very nice...

I'd be more inclined to do soemthing like the above, rather than:

Then they should really get their NVRAM corrected, if in fact their
NVRAMs are cleared.

Look, there's a fine balance here that we must strike -- the solution
that you're proposing implies that there's some 'random' bit-space
within the IEEE NAA with which one can safely encode without stomping
on any valid OUI.

Subject: [PATCH] qla2xxx: Error-out during probe() if we're unable to complete HBA initialization.
Remove a stale check against ha->device_flags
(DFLG_NO_CABLE) as topology scanning is performed within the
DPC-thread context.
