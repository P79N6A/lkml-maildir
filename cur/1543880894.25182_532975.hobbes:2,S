Well, yes and no, afaics. (note also that NOAUTOREL has already gone).
First, this flag should be cleared after return from cancel_rearming_delayed_work().
Also, we should add a lot of nasty checks to workqueue.c
I _think_ we can re-use WORK_STRUCT_PENDING to improve this interface.
Note that if we set WORK_STRUCT_PENDING, the work can't be queued, and
dwork->timer can't be started. The only problem is that it is not so
trivial to avoid races.
I'll try to do something on Sunday.

I doubt we need this "in general". It is easy to add some flag to the
work_struct's container and check it in work->func() when needed.
