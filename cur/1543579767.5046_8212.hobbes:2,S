I read through the tcpdump, and it seems that Linux completely ignores
packets with out-of-window sequence numbers:
* the solaris computers (dynamic...) sends further data although the
Linux box (static) says 'win 0'.
See lines 2067, 2069, 2076, ...
2066  16:31:43.108759 eth0 > static.8664 > dynamic.ih.lucent.com.39406:
. 1583720:1583720(0) ack 69041 win 0 (DF)
2067  16:31:43.110623 eth0 < dynamic.ih.lucent.com.39406 > static.8664:
P 69041:69628(587) ack 1583721 win 0 (DF)
2078  16:31:43.896657 eth0 < dynamic.ih.lucent.com.39406 > static.8664:
. 69041:69041(0) ack 1583721 win 8760 (DF)
* this is the last ack with an in-window sequence number.

2136  16:35:08.488774 eth0 > static.8664 > dynamic.ih.lucent.com.39406:
. 1583721:1585181(1460) ack 69041 win 0 (DF)
* the linux computer sends data
2137  16:35:08.492158 eth0 < dynamic.ih.lucent.com.39406 > static.8664:
. 70501:70501(0) ack 1592481 win 8760 (DF)
* but ignores the ack, probably because the sequence number is out of
window
Perhaps someone who understand TCP could check the code and compare it
with the RFC's?
