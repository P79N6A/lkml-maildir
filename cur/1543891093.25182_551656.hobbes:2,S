Subject: [PATCH] kvm: fix section mismatch warning in kvm-intel.o
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/31/328

Fix following section mismatch warning in kvm-intel.o:
WARNING: o-i386/drivers/kvm/kvm-intel.o(.init.text+0xbd): Section mismatch: reference to .exit.text: (between 'hardware_setup' and 'vmx_disabled_by_bios')
The function free_kvm_area is used in the function alloc_kvm_area which
is marked __init.
The __exit area is discarded by some archs during link-time if a 
module is built-in resulting in an oops.
Signed-off-by: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>

Note: This warning is only seen by my local copy of modpost
      but the change will soon hit upstream.
