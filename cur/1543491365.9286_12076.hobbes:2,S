Just to let you know: The board is a ASUS P2B-DS, and it had a bios
version 1006. Not it has 1008, and the mouse works like a charm, both
with gpm and X. I didn't try the MTRR-crash, because the cause is (and
was, thanks, Richard) clear and I'm sick of it.
The box is slightly faster now. :o)
Thanks to Aaron for pointing me to those sick ASUS pages... :-)
