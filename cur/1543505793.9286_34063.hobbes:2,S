There are specs available which require a lot of money and NDAs and lots of
agreements, lawyers, etc. The software codec for windows encorporates so called
"un reverse engineerable" code which makes things extra difficult. It also just
happens to be illegal to use the code without licensing in various contries. I
expect that a site like kerneli.org would have to hold any dvd code outside of
certain countries.
