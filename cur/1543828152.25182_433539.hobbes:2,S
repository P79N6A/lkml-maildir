Mostly copying the useful information into the read-only mapped page.
However, this doesn't have to be all that expensive.  The particular
information we care about in this case only needs to be copied when a
task begins running on a CPU different from the one it last ran on.  In
fact, on ia64 we already have something very similar to handle certain
I/O pecularities on SN2.

That work could form the basis for a low-impact method of exporting
the current CPU to user space via a read-only mapped page.  I'll admit
to having zero knowledge of whether this would be workable on anything
other than ia64.
Thanks,
Brent
