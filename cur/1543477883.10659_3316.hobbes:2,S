  Hi, all. Version 84 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
NOTE for people who sent me email: I've been on holidays and I'm
slowly catching up with my email. For those with questions other than
"when will devfs be ported to 2.2.0-pre#", I'll get back to you
(eventually:-).
This is against 2.2.0-pre7. Highlights of this release:
- Ported to kernel 2.2.0-pre7
				Regards,
					Richard....
