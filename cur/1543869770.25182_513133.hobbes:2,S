Hi Dan,
what's new with the problem? Did you get any solution? Btw, I've read
the comments in esb2rom.c and because it's grown from ichxrom.c it seems
esb2rom.c has a bug in esb2rom_init_one(). Actually I think you should
receive a message like this:
	"Rom window is closed"
as it's done in ichxrom.c because you've got
	pci_read_config_byte : 4
and that's not the number esb2rom_init_one is expecting to process with...
