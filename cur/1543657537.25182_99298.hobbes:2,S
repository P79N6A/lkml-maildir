perhaps a trivial question:  the first patch you sent out was against
the Config.in file, which made perfect sense to me.  this patch
is against the "Kconfig" file.  i'm not sure what that means,
i see no such file.  (then again, being a kernel newbie, i probably
just don't understand some of the fundamentals.)
is "Kconfig" a precursor to what will eventually become the
Config.in file?
