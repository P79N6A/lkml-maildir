So do my suggestions.
I don't deny that it fixes your problem, that is not what
we're talking about.  We're talking about how one should
fix the problem, and I'm trying to show you why "hidden"
patch is not the answer to that.

Ummm, with "hidden" you still have to make a configuration change.
Second of all, "hidden" makes the kernel behave in a non-RFC compliant
way.  This is the categorization that I use to determine if something
belongs on the netfilter level or not.
If something changes the way in which the Linux networking
behaves wrt. RFCs, this "operation" belongs at the netfilter level.
This is true for the "hidden" patch.  It causes the system to
ignore ARP requests it should respond to.
On the other hand, the "arpfilter" sysctl setting makes the kernel
still behave in an RFC compliant manner, it only responds to ARPs
on interfaces it would use to speak to the requestor.

Yes, we removed "hidden" from 2.2.x in lieu of "arpfilter" sysctl
and the netfilter ARP filtering module.

OSI layers have nothing to do with the problem we are discussing.
BTW, OSI layers are how networking stacks are described in textbooks
and standards and far away from how one should implement said stack.
Van Jacobson even said this once :-)

It would be really nice if people might consider that it could even be
possible to make things like the IPVS layer install the appropriate
NETFILTER_ARP chain rules when the IPVS configuration installed dictates
that one is needed.
People using IPVS wouldn't even need to do _ANYTHING_ if IPVS were
to do that.
And all of that would be _FINE_ because like ARP netfilter, IPVS lies
inside of netfilter where such things which change networking behavior
semantics radically belong.
