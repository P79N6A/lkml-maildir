Yes. We may send something in for review this week.

Right now we are talking about ways to use EVMS in a fail-over cluster 
environment. E.g.: You have four nodes in a cluster each attached to a large 
SAN device. EVMS will provide software fencing of the shared storage so each 
node in the cluster will have a private portion of the SAN. EVMS will allow 
reassigning of storage to other nodes in the cluster in the event of a node 
failure. This approach involves the smallest hit to the existing code and 
very little extra kernel code.
More general cluster support, with support for fully-shared storage (and all 
of the necessary distributed locking and such) will come in 2003. This will 
obviously involve more in-depth code changes.
