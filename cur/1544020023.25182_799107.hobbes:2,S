I'm writing a new dma driver.  My DMAC has multiple channels and only
one channel is capable for generic memcpy and other channels have
fixed role.
Does new framework allow dma driver make only one channel public?
Or should I register two dma_device for DMA_MEMCPY and DMA_SLAVE?
Could you give me some advice?
