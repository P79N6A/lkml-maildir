You are right that my reasoning was incorrect. If someone is doing
"pktsetup ; pktsetup -d" quickly in a loop while someone else is
trying to open the device, one thread could be at the start of
pkt_open() at the same time as another thread is in pkt_new_dev().
However, I added a 5s delay in pkt_open() to enlarge the race window.
I still couldn't make the driver lock up though. The explanation is
that pkt_new_dev() calls blkdev_get() with the CD device (eg /dev/hdc)
as bdev parameter, while do_open() locks the bd_mutex for the pktcdvd
device (eg /dev/pktcdvd/0).
Do you still think this could deadlock? If not, how should the code be
annotated to make this warning go away?
