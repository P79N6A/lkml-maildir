Of course not, but the fact that they do nothing to help us means
that it doesn't carry a lot of weight (IMO, of course).
So: who's time well spent?

As Arjan said, this is how kernel development works. I was using it
to highlight the fact that nobody has done so yet, which gives some
indication that it is not time well spent.

No, they're not. I see no reason why your conjecture would be true and
you have failed to provide even any theories as to why it might be.
What's more, I'm not even clear what you mean by the scalability of a
development process. So, please elaborate -- this is not a rhetorical
question because I'm interested as to why you think this is the case, and
I have not had much experience with closed software development.

Yes, the same goes for OpenSource in general, fine. But what I'm asking
is: how is non-OpenSource different? What can we do better? How can we
learn from them?

But you might not be far wrong in saying that Linux has one of the most
chaotic and scalable development processes in the world.
We have unstable APIs, but IMO we have a great and stable software.

That's fine, but Linux and the development process is a personal
achievement and creation of many here, so you have to try to be
respectful :)

I think most believe what I do: that our development model is scalable
(scalability seems to be the least of its worries), and that unstable
APIs are not a bad thing.
Everybody is also open to try to improve, however "stability breeds
scalability, and instability breeds chaos" is simply not "common sense",
so please explain and justify it before going further.
