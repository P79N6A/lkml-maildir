Actually I posted a "is sendmail on crack?" question last month when 
8.12.5 was released and this was in the release notes.  We got a bunch

I may have the information you need and I may choose only HTML.  It's up to
you. Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any email that you send me nor am
I bound to any obligation to deal with any received email in any given
fashion.  If you send me spam or a virus, I may in whole or part send you
50,000 return copies of it. I may also publically announce any and all
emails and post them to message boards, news sites, and even parody sites. 
I may also mark them up, cut and paste, print, and staple them to telephone
poles for the enjoyment of people without internet access.  This is not a
confidential medium and your assumption that your email can or will be
handled confidentially is akin to baring your backside, burying your head in
the ground, and thinking nobody can see you butt nekkid and in plain view
for miles away.  Don't be a cluebert, buy one from K-mart today.
