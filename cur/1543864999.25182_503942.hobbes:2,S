Could be - I can't be certain but I think we've got one thread
waiting for a buffer to be unpinned before it is written, and
the other thread waiting for log I/O to complete. The first thread
won't unplug the device, and the log I/o is async so it won't either.
What are the new unplugging rules introduced by the git-block
patch? How do they differ from the existing rules?
Cheers,
Dave.
