Hi
Here is my saga continued. I had as mentioned in the preceding post 500mb of 
Inode cache entries and about 80mb of dentry_cache entries, accounting for +- 
600mb if "missing" memory.
These should be dynamically de-allocatable, so if a program needs the ram it 
will be freed as necessary. So I ran a little memory hog perl script :
---
#!/usr/bin/perl
$fred=1;
@bob=('Test');
while ($fred==1)
{
	push (@bob,@bob);
}
------
This naturally started eating memory, unexpectedly the kernel started paging 
hectically to swap using 250mb in no time, (ie filling the 1.2gigs of ram). 
How can this be??? Shouldn't the cache tables simply be purged in the event 
of memory need....
Anyway I then kill the job, suddenly  most of my physical ram is freed (250mb 
used).
I then do a swapoff /dev/sda3 (250mb used), this completely locks the machine 
for 50 seconds and pushes the load to 31 when I can log back in. Then 
micraculously I am using only 170mb of physical ram. I turn swap back on and 
all is well.... 
Can anyone please explain this odd behaviour.. ???
Below is a free after this whole debacle..:::
------
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1157444     126364    1031080          0      10924      60080

Swap:       641016          0     641016

Netraid 4m  (AACRAID) card with 80mb of Cache and 6x 10000rpm SCSII III HDD, 
I can only hope that the driver is running in DMA.... :-|
