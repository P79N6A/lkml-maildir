Do you propose to keep DMAs running while suspending-to-RAM? That
sounds really unsafe; we are shutting down our PCI controllers at that
time; doing that while DMAs are running sounds bad.

No. Sorry, you are wrong here. 
Remember that during resume we run
freeze()
copy old data into memory
thaw()
. Now, if the old kernel left DMAs running, it could be overwriting
the data we are copying in. It is not about DMA tables. While
resuming, CPU needs to be alone, without interference from DMA engines
(or other CPUs), because copying back old image means writing to
memory that was not properly alocated.
(Now, we could add one more hook, turn_off_dmas_for_copyback(), but
that looks like way too many hooks to me. And I'm not comfortable with
DMA engines running while I'm trying to copy image. They may be
overwriting data I'm trying to copy...)
