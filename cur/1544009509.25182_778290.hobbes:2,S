Thanks, James.  I talked about patch 1 with Dhaval, and while he's ok
with the patch he (rightfully) thought there should be some extra
documentation.  If it's not too much trouble would you mind swapping
out patch 1 for the following?  (Otherwise I can send a new patch on
top of the original)
thanks,

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] user namespaces: let user_ns be cloned with fairsched
fairsched creates a per-uid directory under /sys/kernel/uids/.
So when you clone(CLONE_NEWUSER), it tries to create
/sys/kernel/uids/0, which already exists, and you get back
-ENOMEM.
This was supposed to be fixed by sysfs tagging, but that
was postponed (ok, rejected until sysfs locking is fixed).
So, just as with network namespaces, we just don't create
those directories for user namespaces other than the init.
Changelog:
	Dec 8 2008: Documented the currently bogus state of
	 support for user groups with user namespaces.  In
	 particular, all users in a user namespace should be
	 children of the user which created the user namespace.
	 This is yet to be unimplemented.

+8. Implementation note: user namespaces
+
+User namespaces are intended to be hierarchical.  But they are currently
+only partially implemented.  Each of those has ramifications for CFS.
+
+First, since user namespaces are hierarchical, the /sys/kernel/uids
+presentation is inadequate.  Eventually we will likely want to use sysfs
+tagging to provide private views of /sys/kernel/uids within each user
+namespace.
+
+Second, the hierarchical nature is intended to support completely
+unprivileged use of user namespaces.  So if using user groups, then
+we want the users in a user namespace to be children of the user
+who created it.
+
+That is currently unimplemented.  So instead, every user in a new
+user namespace will receive 1024 shares just like any user in the
+initial user namespace.  Note that at the moment creation of a new
+user namespace requires each of CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_SETUID, and
+CAP_SETGID.
