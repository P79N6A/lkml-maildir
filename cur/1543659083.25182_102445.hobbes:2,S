Well.. I submitted  the Kconfig patch that makes it so.  However, I only did
that because there's code inside the ACPI_SLEEP that references a variable over
in SOFTWARE_SUSPEND.
A cleaner fix would probably be to move the variable someplace where it will
exist even when SOFTWARE_SUSPEND isn't defined.
