This comment or similar things are apparently not necessary _within 
subsystems_, just across subsystems, i.e. where the hierarchy of 
subdirectories and files does not match the hierarchy of dependencies.

"make oldconfig" could ask questions when it sees need to disable 
formerly enabled options.
In general I think:
As long as we talk about the various prefab UIs to manipulate .config 
(i.e. "make {allyes, allmod, allno, def, g, menu, old, rand, silentold, 
update-po-, x, ''}config"), there may be ways to implement modes of 
operation which do what people expect from 'select' but with 'depends 
on' alone. To ensure that no user group is discriminated in the process, 
committees could be formed. (<- attempt on irony)
It will get difficult to entirely please users who don't use these 
interfaces to .config. But it seems these users are better off without 
'select'.
