I had the exact same nvidia driver with 2.6.12 (just recompiled) and it 
didn't happen there.
But just in case I used slabtop to watch scsi_cmd_cache grow by 1.24KB per 
second (104MB per day), then I rmmoded nvidia and watched it grow by 
1.16KB per second.
The speed is not constant, watching it, and listening to the disks, it 
looks like it grows with each IO request.

Here is my lsmod, but since I compile most things into the kernel the 
config.gz I sent earlier is probably much more useful.
And BTW I don't even have any scsi devices. scsi is being used by sata and 
usb storage.
