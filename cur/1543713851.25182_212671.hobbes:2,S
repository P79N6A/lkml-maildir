No. For example, the embedded 4xx IBM CPUs can have several page sizes,
and a size like 16k could be useful for embedded applications: We don't
implement support for that in the ppc32 kernel yet, but we may do, it
makes a _lot_ of sense for small embedded configs with no swap, as it
reduces page tables size & pressure on the TLB software load handlers.
