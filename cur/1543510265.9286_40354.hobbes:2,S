So instead of login loading all the groups blindly, have it AND the
list of groups the user is allowed to be in (/etc/group or whatever entries
listing the user) with a list the user has declared she wants to be in,
stored in ~/.group or similar.. Maybe have a su-like program to spawn a shell
with a given list of extra group ids for when you need to do a couple of
things with a particular group list, but don't want to edit your standard
default groups (~/.group).
