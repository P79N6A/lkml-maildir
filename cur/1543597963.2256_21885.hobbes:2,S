I have two problems with this:
1. They maybe think once about it, but are they doing it a second time?
If the type of the argument is changed somewhere in the header, the min
argument is easily missed, since...
2. This macro doesn't produce a warning like the typeof version does.
The typeof version warns you about signed/unsigned compares, while an
assignment gives no warning.
