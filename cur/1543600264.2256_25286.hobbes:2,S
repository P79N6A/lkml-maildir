I have a setup at work like this. I have X running on ATI rage 128 card
and a G400 as a console. I myself sometime ago got 2 independent X servers
running on a multidesktop system (2 monitors, 2 keybaords and 2 mice). In
this case you need to make sure you start the second X server with the -vt
option.
