If kernel printing were going to be done over, I would suggest that 
instead of the current fixed format strings, the format argument would 
be an index, an ordinal into an array of *char pointers, and the string 
so described would be used as the format. These strings and pointers 
could be put in two modules, one part of init to be released after boot 
like other init code, one resident. And by loading different modules the 
error messages could be as short, long, or colorful as desired, and in 
any language and/or character set available via escape sequence.
Of course people would say it's larger than what we have, harder to use, 
would take a huge effort to convert existing messages... and that's all 
true. But as you said, the Chinese is probably more germane than colors. 
Think about it, kernel messages in Gaelic or even rap lyrics
   "Hate to tell you,
    it must be said,
    I can't boot
    your disk be dead."
Or Latin, CRDOS had some comments in Latin and one PhD who thought his 
code was best described in BNF.
To be serious, a notifier to a user program, *after boot*, would allow 
all this flexibility, although I still think it's too late to change.
