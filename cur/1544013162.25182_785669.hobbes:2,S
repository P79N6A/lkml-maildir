Might also have been me trying to figure out what was going on, I think 
I've got the example.com bits all worked out now (ahhh the joys of lack 
of documentation) I should have a patch for django to fill in the 
missing bit of knowledge in a bit.
That said if your still seeing tracebacks report them to ftpadmin and if 
we can't figure them out, we'll kick them over to patchwork as bug reports.
