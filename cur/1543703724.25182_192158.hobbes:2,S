Yes, we've used a binary search for the last few years to look up the
entry, because a linear search makes things like real SIGSEGV's really
_really_ slow.
The linker sorts the thing normally, but gets confused by different code
sections. And while we right now only have init/exit sections (in addition 
to the normal code one), that already has caused problems several times.
