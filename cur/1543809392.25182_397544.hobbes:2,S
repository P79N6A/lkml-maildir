Good point (and the one I was afraid of coming up).
This would mean dropping the HDIO_GETGEO ioctl completely and force
applications such as fdisk/sfdisk and even dosemu to determine disk
geometry for themselves. Which I think actually would be the most
correct approach.
But this would come to a similar situation as in the beginnings of 2.6
when we had partitioning problems because bios geometry support was
dropped.
That's something I don't have the guts to decide (and luckily can't), so
I'd rather go with sysfs and provide a means to be as compatible as
possible without doing anything automagically.
