If you are running into kmalloc size limit, please consider some
alternative method of allocation.
Can you map it into the page cache, as Al Viro has done in recent
patches?
Can you break your allocation into an array of pages, obtained via
get_free_page?
If runlists are on-disk structures, can you look at bh->b_data instead
of keeping them in memory?
