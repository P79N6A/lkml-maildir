In general, this is not a problem we have.
/proc/self points to the process, not the task group leader.
They are different. Look at /proc/*/stat, where the
per-process info is summary data. The per-thread
stat file is not summary data. This is intended to be
true for all files in /proc; there may be some with bugs.
Some of the data can not be summed up and will not
always be shared. This is legacy crud. Don't use it,
and don't try to "fix" it. It's there so that old programs
can continute to work as long as weird threading isn't
in use.
Note that it was intended that non-legacy additions
would normally be added to either the process directory
or the thread directory, not both. I think somebody may
have ripped out the ability to do this; at the very least
there have been numerous illogical additions.

Changing /proc/self makes you get per-thread data
when you asked for per-process data. That's bad.

If it hurts, don't do that. We allow foot shooting.

As I predicted, the container bloat would be a never-ending
source of bugs. You're discovering bugs where there were none.
You'll never run out of this sort of problem. Keeping Linux lean
and simple would be far better.
