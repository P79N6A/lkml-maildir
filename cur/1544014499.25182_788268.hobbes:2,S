Subject: [PATCH] Cleanup: Remove zero-sized file (clock.h)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/7/269

arch/arm/mach-integrator/clock.h was not removed properly and was left
zero-sized so it was being removed by 'make distclean', leaving an
uncommitted change. This removes it.
