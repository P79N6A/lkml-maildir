Space after "," please.
OK, let me see if I understand fsd_default_off().
+static int fsd_default_off(void)
+{
+	/*
+	 * Actions taken:
+	 *

+	 *
+	 *    2. Power off

+	 */
+
+	printk(KERN_EMERG "Fast Power Off initiated.\n");
+	fastpoweroff_prepare();
+	fastpoweroff();
+	fastpoweroff_standby();
+	return 1;
+}
Does this say (2) power off the system and then (3) power off devices?
How does it power off devices after calling fastpoweroff()?
Or is fastpoweroff() only setting the stage for something to
happen later?
Thanks,
