It not only could be, it _is_ true. Not using an output to port 0x80 is what 
this discussion is about.

The latter probably and I don't bleedin' well care. In a discussion about 
removing the out to 0x80 the only thing that is relevant is what it should 
be replaced with. Usually, "nothing" will do but generally, udelay(1) will.

No damnit, you misunderstand. I'm saying that an outb_p _should_ be defined 
in terms of the bus clock since if you want a wall-clock delay you should be 
using just that.
The _hardware_ is synced to the bus clock and therefore, having a delay 
available that is synced to the bus clock as well makes some sense. And 
again again again again not withstanding that, a udelay will still be an 
okay replacement in practice.
