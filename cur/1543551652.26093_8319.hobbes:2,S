I guess this is not the case. YOu should see system messages and the
system hanging on the later described issue.

Exactly, wondered why ? 2.2.14BOOT is not trying to disable the serial
number while 2.2.14 is. This hang then there.

Actually, just use a boot disk or a recent SUSE cd for that matter, boot
the installed system, recompile the kernel without "disable cpuid
serial" and you are all set.

By the way,
that's what redhat support is for. They should have told you that there
is an issue with the supplied kernel and durons and thunderbirds.
I guess this is OT on the LKML.
Anyway, my suggestion should work, since it worked for me.
