Three things:
2.6.0t9 still can leave the user with a dead keyboard
If Vojtech does not provide a better patch I suppose
you should apply my patch of a few days ago.
Within a few days two people have reported that they cannot
mount a FAT fs that 2.4 and Windows handle fine.
Probably also that should be fixed, for example with
my patch from yesterday.
I have run 2.6.0-test6 without any problems. Switched
to 2.6.0-test9 today. Something involving job control
or so is broken. Several of my remote xterms hang.
Will investigate later.
