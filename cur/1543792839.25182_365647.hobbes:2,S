Recursion removal is a pretty standard technique and featured in almost
all introductionary computer science texts. A quick google query finds
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359344
All recursive algorithms can be expressed non-recursively, although it
might not always be as nice. Or you can put an upper limit on the
allowed complexity of queries.
