I didn't know about noinline, thanks for the tip. It works as expected,
however in the case of i2cdev_ioctl I'm not sure if it's worth it.
Without it, I have:
0x02ae i2cdev_ioctl [i2c-dev]:                          192
With noinline, I have:
0x02ac i2cdev_ioctl_smbus [i2c-dev]:                    112
0x05bc i2cdev_ioctl_rdrw [i2c-dev]:                     112
0x087e i2cdev_ioctl [i2c-dev]:                          32
32 + 112 = 144, 192 - 144 = only 48 bytes saved on the stack, at the
price of some performance loss. OTOH this makes the binary slightly
smaller (not sure why), which is always nice:
add/remove: 2/0 grow/shrink: 0/1 up/down: 1121/-1182 (-61)
function                                     old     new   delta
i2cdev_ioctl_rdrw                              -     696    +696
i2cdev_ioctl_smbus                             -     425    +425
i2cdev_ioctl                                1482     300   -1182
