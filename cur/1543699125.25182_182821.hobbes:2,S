Hi,
similar problem on my Dell I8600 with integrated bluetooth. It happens
at "/etc/init.d/hotplug stop". I think (but am not sure, I would have to
test) that it happens only if hciconfig is up. I haven't created proper
stop scripts so far...
My guess is that some bluez module unload failure cause the oops.
The switch on my I8600 is a hotkey (<ALT><F2>).
