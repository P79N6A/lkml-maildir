	In theory, you can use a Linux box as an ethernet switch, as
opposed to a router (and I apologize for the responses from people
who did not know the difference).  However, I understand that almost
nobody is using the code right now, so it may have accumulated
some bugs.  In any case, the option that you want is CONFIG_BRIDGE.
You will also need the user level code available from
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/admin/bridgex.tar.gz.
