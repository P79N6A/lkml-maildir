I remember running into this a couple of years ago.  I _THINK_ what I remember
finding out is that bash needed a file descriptor for its own internal use
for executing commands like "source myfile.sh".  The use of FD 255 was an
attempt to get hold of a file descriptor that was not likely to collide with
file descriptors that a user might be using in their scripts.  I dont remember
the exact details.  Here is the code from jobs.c of the bash 1.14.7 sources:
      /* Make sure that we are using the new line discipline. */
      /* Get our controlling terminal.  If job_control is set, or
         interactive is set, then this is an interactive shell no
         matter what. */
      shell_tty = dup (fileno (stderr));
      /* Find the highest unused file descriptor we can. */
      {
        int ignore, nds = getdtablesize ();
        if (nds <= 0)
          nds = 20;
        else if (nds > 256)
          nds = 256;
        while (--nds > 3)
          {
            if (fcntl (nds, F_GETFD, &ignore) == -1)
              break;
          }
