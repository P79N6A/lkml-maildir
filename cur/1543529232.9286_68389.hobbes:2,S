This looks extremely odd.  I cannot reproduce it with an almost
identical system (at least, identical as far as you have described).
Apart from the "Permission denied" message, the link-count and size of
both disk1 and usr look odd. They are both 1.  I would expect 2 for
the link count, and 4096 for the size.
1/ What filesystems are you using? ext2fs or something else.
2/ Are there any local mount points. My guess is that both usr and
   disk1 are local mount points. If so, what sort of filesystem.
3/ Can you show me an "ls -l" from the client.
4/ What export options are you using? A "cat /etc/exports" or
    "cat /proc/fs/nfs/exports" 
   might help.
