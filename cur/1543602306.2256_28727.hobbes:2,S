Well, actually this lead me to another idea: I created a disk image 
on my reiserfs home partition (the one I usually use to trigger the 
problem; note however that I can also reproduce it on my PII-350). 
Firstly, I formatted the image with ext2 and run the file creation script. 
No problems, it works fine. 
Then, I formatted the image with reiserfs and tried the file creation 
script. No problems either.. Strange. 
I doubt it's a fragmentation issue (as kernel-2.4.6 does not have the 
problem and the image file would be fragmented as well). 
Could this be some sort of reiserfs flushing issue? 
<speculation> I mean reiserfs wants to flush the newly created files 
too frequently. If reiserfs is on a disk partition, then this results in 
the performance degradation, if it is on an image, all requests to write 
to the image are cached again (by the reiserfs one level below which 
works fine because there is just manipulation of one large file) and the 
problem does not show up. </speculation>
Okay, as just a few people on the list seem to worry about the issue, 
I spent an hour online and downloaded kernel 2.4.6 + patches for 
2.4.[789] again to see exactly where the problem begins.
