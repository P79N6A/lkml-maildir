Hi Kurt --
Thanks for the patch, I'll check it out.  "-32" should be a protocol
stall (Intel <asm/errno.h> I assume) that could be retried ... it'd
be better done in device-specific code (pl_reset) than in the
generic layer though.  I'll look at providing a "real" fix, and may
ask you to check out a different patch.
Those Prolific chips are perhaps not as finely crafted as I'd like
to see, there are a bunch of "gotchas" ... this could be a good
way to work around one of them, but I suspect you'll still find that
under load testing, you'll be glad the TX watchdog is so good
at barking (sometimes every few seconds)!

Subject: usbnet: prolific fails reset
Hi David,
got a USB network cable and was happy to see that it's supported by usbnet.
Good job, thanks!
usb0: register usbnet 001/004, Prolific PL-2301/PL-2302
However:
Upon ifconfig,
usb-uhci.c: interrupt, status 3, frame# 922
usb0: open reset fail (-32) usbnet 001/004, Prolific PL-2301/PL-2302
The ifconfig fails to up the interface, consequently.
Attached patch prevents the driver from returning the reset failure.
Guess what: The networking worked just fine then.
Probably the real solution is different ...
Patch is against 2.4.16.
Regards,
