err, I think I'd forgotten about container_isolate_pages().  Yes, that
addresses my main concern.

Sure, but that's deliberate!
(And we don't have a global LRU - the LRUs are per-zone).

Yes, that would be the tricky part.  But we generally don't care what
physical zone user pages come from, apart from NUMA optimisation.

Yup.  Let's keep plugging away with Pavel's approach, see where it gets us.
