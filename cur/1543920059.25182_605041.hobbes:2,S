No; maybe later this week.

Here's the log for the second suggestion:
narf ~ # hdparm -B255 /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 setting Advanced Power Management level to disabled
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD failed: Input/output error
narf ~ # hdparm -S1 /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 setting standby to 1 (5 seconds)
narf ~ # cat /proc/interrupts
