Wrong. I guess you're only trying it on a machine that isn't actually
doing anything :). I've forgotten whether it was this freezer
implementation or the last, but we've been testing freezing processes
when the load average exceeds 100. If you have a thread that is syncing
and another that's submitting I/O continually (think dd, for example),
you want this.

Again, try it under load... and stop talking about fork and exit like
they're real hot paths. (Unless you regularly submit your machines to
fork bombs :)).
