No, we can't after 2.6.24 got released.
Let me make an example:
- looking at the timelines, e.g. Ubuntu 8.04 LTS is likely to
  ship with 2.6.24
- this experimental feature might be enabled there
- this Ubuntu release with this kernel will be supported and used
  for five years

There is a difference between "complete the feature" and "early adopters 
to start playing with the feature" on the one side, and making something 
available in a released kernel on the other side.
For development and playing with it it can depend on BROKEN (perhaps 
with the dependency removed through the first -rc kernels), but as soon 
as it's available in a -final kernel the ABI is fixed.
