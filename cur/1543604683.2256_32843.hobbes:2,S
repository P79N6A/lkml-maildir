Sure, if they want pre-emption on SMP.  Of course, then they'll want
priority inheritence.

WTF?  I'll spell it out for you again:
	static inline void foo_put(struct foo *foo)
	{
		if (atomic_dec_and_test(foo->use))
			kfree(foo);
	}
Write side normal:
	lock
	unhash(foo)
	unlock
	foo_put(foo)
Write side RCU:
	lock
	unhash(foo)
	unlock
	rcu_call(foo_put, foo);
		/* ie. call foo_put(foo) "later". */
That's all.  Really.

I know you're under strain, but think harder please.
