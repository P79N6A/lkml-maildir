Fortunately... since kernel HZ changed to 1000Hz, I have about two these
spurious interrupts delivered to the CPU on my A7V each second. Fortunately 
they are always really spurious, not misdelivered other interrupts, but 
seeing values like 10000 in ERR field in /proc/interrupts is something new 
to me ;-) Maybe VIA or AMD should really clarify what's the problem.
