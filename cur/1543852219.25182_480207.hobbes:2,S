Are you sure you can safely call file->f_op->poll() from inside a callback 
based wakeup? The low level driver may be calling the wakeup with one of 
its locks held, and during the file->f_op->poll may be trying to acquire 
the same lock. I remember there was a discussion about this, and assuming 
the above not true, made epoll code more complex (and slower, since an 
extra O(R) loop was needed to fetch events).
