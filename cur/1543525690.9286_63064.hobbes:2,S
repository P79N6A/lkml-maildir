Yes.  However, it does seem to be acting a little odd.  When it booted up
the num lock light was on, but when I pressed capslock to check it, num
lock went out.
It also seems to be inserting random characters every so often.  Examples:
"check 'it" when I typed "check it"
"beef" when I typed "be "
"cha7racters" when I typed "characters"
"Examples:B" (shift key then acted 'stuck' until next pressed)
I'll just double-check that it's kernel-related; I normally run a 2.2
kernel on this machine, so I'll try that for a while to check that it's
different.
Tim.
