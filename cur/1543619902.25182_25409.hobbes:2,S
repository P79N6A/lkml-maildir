yes. Priority boost/penalty works for reniced tasks just as well.
with the -K2 scheduler (i will release the patch soon) it will be
progressively harder for reniced tasks to gain 'heavily interactive'
status (ie. to be reinserted into the active array). For nice +19 tasks it
will be impossible to get this status. (for nice +15 tasks it's still
possible.)

the fact that we might need to 'exclude' certain tasks from a mechanism
shows that the mechanism is not robust.

you have to renice if you want to give non-java tasks a higher share of
the CPU time. Java threads will still be interactive relative to each
other.

'response' in terms of interactive latencies should be good, yes.
'response' in terms of relative CPU time given to CPU hogs and interactive
tasks wont be as 'good' as with the old scheduler. (ie. CPU hogs *will* be
punished harder - this is what is needed for good interactivity after
all.) So if you see that some of your interactive tasks are not as
important as you'd like them to be, then renicing them somewhat will give
more CPU time even to CPU hogs. The kernel wont be able to figure out what
is important to you though - the default right now is that interactive
tasks are more important. If the opposite is desired then the kernel needs
external help - ie. nice values.
