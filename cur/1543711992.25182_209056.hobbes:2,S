Hi,
	When trying 'modprobe root_plug vendor_id=xxxx product_id=yyyy' on a
workable usb storage device, I get all commands locked (which should
appear when I remove it) ... I also get 'cannot execute /sbin/mingetty'
from new console login tries then 'respawning too fast, disabled for 5
minutes' ....
Someone could help me ?
PS :I'm not subscribed to lkml.
Regards,
Fabian
