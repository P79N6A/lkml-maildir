No.
Yet, the configuration may be valid. If you have a board with tda8290, it
_will_ need another chip, like tda827x.
In the past, both tda8290 and tda827x were handled by the same driver, and
worked for analog only.
So, IMO, this is a regression.

I can't foresee any issues with those drivers. The risk I can see is to compile
some dvb core things that aren't needed, or whose Kconfig dependencies may be
incomplete.
I didn't make yet a deeper analysis to be sure that this won't cause any issues,
but I suspect that this would be safe.
I agree that we need to check the resulting dependencies.
Cheers,
