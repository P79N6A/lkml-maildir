The netlink control channel seems to work very well, but I can
certainly change the examples to use something different.  Could you
suggest something?

The only things that are atomic are the counts of produced and
consumed buffers and these are only ever updated or read in the slow
buffer-switch path.  They're atomic because if they weren't, wouldn't
it be possible for the client to read an unfinished value if the
producer was in the middle of updating it?

Yes, I can move them out and update the examples to reflect that, but
I thought that if this was something that most clients would need to
do, it made some sense to keep it in relayfs and avoid duplication in
the clients.

The buffer switch callback is already where this is handled, unless
you're thinking of something else - one of the first checks in the
buffer switch is relay_buf_full(), which always returns 0 if the
buffer is in overwrite mode.
