(note that the implementation I just posted is a proof of concept: I
just noticed that I need to keep track of wether or not I am called
before or after the mark_rodata is done, so the apply alternatives does
not crash at early boot because of the global_flush_tlb().)
A spinlock it will be then :)
SMP alternatives deals with this by simply disabling the whole
protection:
mark_rodata_ro():
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
        /* It must still be possible to apply SMP alternatives. */
        if (num_possible_cpus() <= 1)
#endif
        {
                change_page_attr(virt_to_page(start),
                                 size >> PAGE_SHIFT, PAGE_KERNEL_RX);
                printk("Write protecting the kernel text: %luk\n", size >> 10);
        }
So it's ok if no CPU can be hotplugged, since the CPUs are brought up
before the mark_rodata_ro is done, but not if HOTPLUG is selected.
