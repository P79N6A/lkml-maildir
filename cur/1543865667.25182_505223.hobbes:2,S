Yeap, pretty much.  I thought fixing drive side cable detection would
fix it, but hell no.

I dunno.  It always ended up in PIO mode in my case.  I can post the log
if necessary.

Hmmm... Anyone happen to have working nvidia contact?

Yeah, please.  If I connect a hdd at the end of 40c cable and leaving
the middle connector empty, the 80c bit is always one and the drive says
it's 80c cable while the BIOS configured mode is correctly udma33.  This
is the same for SAMSUNG SP0802N, Maxtor 91301U3 and HITACHI_DK23BA-20.
