The original question was:
Couldn't the TCore patch deadlock in elf_core_dump on a semiphore held by a 
sleeping process that gets placed onto the phantom runque?
So far I can't tell the problem is real or not, but I'm worried :(
I haven't hit any such deadlocks in my stress testing, such as it is.  In my 
review of the code I don't see any obviouse problems dispite the fact that 
the mmap_sem is explicitly grabbed by elf_core_dump.
