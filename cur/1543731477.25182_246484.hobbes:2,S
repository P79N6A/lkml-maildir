i've uploaded -Q1:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-Q1
as with -Q0, the following patch has to be applied to 2.6.8.1 first:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/diff-bk-040828-2.6.8.1.bz2
those who still have DRI problems under -Q1 - please unapply the
drm_os_linux.h change, does the fix the lockups?
Changes since -Q0:
- the synchronize_irq() fix - this might help SMP problems.
- adds unlock_kernel() to the NTFS and ext3 mount path, to fix the
  latencies reported by Lee Revell.
