*sigh* You're not listening to me. The _BIOS_ is the problem. If you don't
use the _BIOS_, you don't have a problem. We (2d3D, Inc. the people who
wrote the driver) are paid to use the BIOS. We have a non-bios setmode, but
were not using it because I'm not allowed to release that source.
I've told people before: If you want it to work, write a non-BIOS setmode.
I'll even give you tips if you try, but that is all I can do. Sorry, life is
tough.
