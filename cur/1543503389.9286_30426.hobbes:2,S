Subject: finding a comscire qng random number device driver

hello:
i have a comscire qng random number generator for which i need a device
driver.  i can write it myself, but since the device already has a
designated major number (77 char, /dev/qng) i figured there was probably
already code out there.  it's not in the kernel source distro; comscire does
not have a linux device driver.  i've checked the lsm, blatura's linapps
page, the External Parallel Port Devices for linux page (the qng has a
parallel interface), the kernel mailing list archives and the repositories
at kernel.org, sunsite, and walnut creek.  is anyone familiar with this
device, or is there an obscure driver source repository out there somewhere
that i might not have checked?  this posting is pretty much a last resort
before writing the driver.
thanks,
jt
