There a couple of now-famous interactivity tests wher -G6 succeed and
2.6.0-test2 fails.
First, with -G6 I can't make XMMS MP3s skip simply by scrolling a web
page loaded in Mozilla 1.4, no matter how hard I try.
Second, moving a window like mad (show window contents while moving set
to ON) won't freeze X, and with 2.6.0-test2 this could be done in
several seconds of moving the window.
Still, OpenOffice is dog slow when anything else is getting CPU cycles,
but Andrew Morton pointed out on another thread this seems to be a
problem with OpenOffice , not with the scheduler.
