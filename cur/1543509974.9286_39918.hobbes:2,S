Hi,
Since version 2.3.7 (the 2.3.6 is ok), ./fs/smb/cache.c doesn't link anymore.
The 'get_cached_page' function, (still used in ./fs/smb/cache.c and declared
in ./include/linux/mm.h) has disappeared from ./mm/filemap.c.
Thank you,
philippe_baudrier@effix.fr
PS: FYI: same problem in version 2.3.18.

Subject:  About your linux kernel patch in filemap.c, of 21.05.1999
Hi,
Using SMB on a regular basis, the kernel don't compile anymore above ~v2.3.6.
During compilation, a particular message appears, saying
the 'get_cached_page' procedure doesn't exist anymore
(procedure used in ./fs/smbfs/cache.c  &  code source found in ./mm/filemap.c, originally).
I've personnaly 'patched' <pig work ;-)> my own version 2.3.18 of the kernel for it to work,
but I'd like to know if you know the kernel version in which this 'bug' will be corrected ?
Thanks a lot,
philippe_baudrier@effix.fr
PS: Curiously, the 'put_cached_page' procedure still exists.
