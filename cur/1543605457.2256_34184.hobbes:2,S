it does; at least on my debian system:
# e2label /dev/hda1
# e2label /dev/hda1 foo 
# e2label /dev/hda1
foo
# mount LABEL=foo /mnt
# 
you can use the same LABEL=foo syntax in /etc/fstab...
according to my fstab(5) manpage this also works with xfs, although i've
not tried it.
surely i am not deluded and this is a not-debian-specific feature?
having used nothing but debian for some years now i really can't be
sure...
