Greetings,
Under 2.1.132 my network card seems to get hosed up after 
a while.  No packets seem to be sent/received via the interface.
Looking at the hub, my station light doesn't flash.
It's happenned twice, once after 12 hours; the other time it
took all of 10 minutes.  The only way to get things working 
again is to reboot.
Nothing logged via syslog when the problem occurs.  Everything
*looks* ok, but ifconfig output just shows more and more 
errors on the card instead of TX packets.  
2.1.129 (and previous) work ok for me.
System hardware:
Asus 1662D, 2x 200Mhz PPro, 2x Buslogic-KT946, ATI Mach64,
WinTV card, SB AWE32. And the network card is an old Western
Digital 8013...
I'm not subscribed to the mailing list, but I do follow
it via www.linuxhq.com, and can be reached via email.
Any suggestions or help in tracking down the problem 
appreciated.  If there is anything I can do to force
more debug info here, please let me know.
Thanks (and happy new year!)
Dave Lugo
