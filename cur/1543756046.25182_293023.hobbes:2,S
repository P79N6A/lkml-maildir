No, it occurs during resume, right after the image has been restored (sorry,
I should have said this before).

If my understanding is correct, the time between suspend (ie the creation of
the image) and resume (ie the resotration of the image) is considered as spent
in the kernel, so it triggers softlockup as soon as its threads are woken up (is
that correct, Pavel?).
