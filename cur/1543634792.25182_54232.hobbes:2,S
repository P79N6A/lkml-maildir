This came up about a year back when zerocopy networking was merged.
Intel boxes started running more slowly purely because of the 8+8
alignment thing.
I changed tcp to use a different copy if either source or dest were
not eight-byte aligned, and found that the resulting improvement
across a mixed networking load was only 1%.  Your numbers are higher,
so perhaps there are different alignments in the mix...
One question:  have you tested on other CPU types?  This problem is
very specific to Intel hardware.  On AMD, the eight-byte alignement
artifact does not exist at all.  It could be that your patch is not
desirable on such CPUs?
