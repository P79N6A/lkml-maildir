The problem is that on s390 several virtual servers share the PHY and MAC 
part of the card and therefore have the same MAC address. Unfortunately 
IPv6 uses this MAC address to build an address. Now all virtual servers 
have the same auto configured IPv6 address - which is bad.
The proposed solution was to enable network card drivers to define their own 
ipv6 address auto configuration. 
If I recall correctly Dave Miller was not sure about rfc compliance.
