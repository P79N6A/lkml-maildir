	If you are willing to accept the still-not-ideal constraint
that the inode number stays constant so long as only Linux (or, in any
case, another system employing the same algorithm) performs directory
operations on the filesystem in questions, you might implement an
auxiliary file that holds persistent inode mappings.
	The natural place to put the inode map would be on the same
underlying FAT filesystem, but for extra brownie points you could
perhaps arrange for it to be located on a different filesystem.  To
protect against external meddling (e.g., renaming a file with
Ms. Windows), the persistent inode map should contain checksums of
the VFAT filesystem's underlying directory pages.
	This is piling cruft upon cruft, but it could be made to work
under the given constraint.  It could even be yet another layered
filesystem (PVFAT?) in the towering FAT ensemble.  Future generations
will not thank you, though.
