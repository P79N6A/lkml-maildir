Yes, neither did I, but there always should be some
compromiss if the better solution is not found. :)

But the pcspkr driver is not an OSS, it is an "input" driver.

The problem is that the snd-pcsp doesn't replace pcspkr. And if I do
what you say, whoever opted to use snd-pcsp, will no longer be able
to hear the console beeps, and that I find a disadvantage.
I myself do not like the console beeps, but some people will really
complain. So I'd like to find another solution if possible, and the
input solution looked quite what I needed.

But I register an input handler, and whenever the pcspkr driver is
loaded, my "connect" handler is invoked, and from there I send an
SND_SILENT.

OK, how about something under a SYN_CONFIG then?

But what if I just want to grab SND_BELL so that it is delivered
exclusively to my driver? Intuitively, I'd use the input subsystem
for that, but unfortunately it simply doesn't have that grabbing
capability (I asked Vojtech to be sure - he confirmed that there
is none). Be there such a capability, that would be excellent, no
hacks will be needed. But if I modify the pcspkr driver to disable
it directly via some function call, then snd-pcsp will always load
pcspkr, which is highly undesireable. I am not sure what did you
mean about the driver core though.

The difference is that the snd-pcsp and pcspkr drivers are doing the
completely different tasks. snd-pcsp doesn't absolete pcspkr - being
an ALSA driver it only plays sound, but doesn't do the console beeps,
thats the problem. Somehow I have to make sure they both can peacefully
co-exist. Making them mutually exclusive is bad, and making them
dependant (by calling into each other directly) is also rather bad.
