Hm, -git17 locked up hard when trying to access the device mapper
(just like -rc1), not even sysrq was usable any more. Sadly, 
nothing was logged to the disks/network. Will try earlier snapshots 
then. And yes, this resyncing of the md devices after an unclean shutdown 
is a real pita right now...
Thanks for reporting!
Christian.
