Nothing.  That question comes up so often that the lkml-faq maintainers
should add it (if not already there, haven't checked the faq lately).
BTW. There is no need to download the whole tarball, somebody or another
invented the concept of taking the difference between two versions and
"patch" the old version to generate the new version.  Just in case you
didn't know...
