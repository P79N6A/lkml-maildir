Yep that sounds better and is easier to type.

remounting only makes sense for block based filesystems?
That does not sound right.  
Definitely something to look into next time I get the chance.

Good catch.  I did say this was a first cut that was too ugly to use.
The problem is those functions need to move out of buffer.c
I have moved them into fs-writeback.c and things still appear to work.
My method of exacting the dependencies was to remove the obvious files
from the build and then to fixup whatever linker problems were left.
