Thanks to Michael Krause there is a binary package with
thread-enabled Xlibs out there for us :
http://ms.demo.org/rst/threadedxlibs.tar.gz
If you want to do it yourself, there are patches for XFree 
that come with linuxthreads sources.
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/home/sopwith/xfree/
        
has rpms of a patched XFree 3.2

I hope this helps.
