Hello
I am using a Tyan S4882 motherboard with 4 CPU's that has a LM85 sensor chip
which reports the following message during boot:
     .
     .
     ipmi device interface
     Enabling SMBus multiplexing for Tyan S4882
     lm85 0-002e: Client (0,0x2e) config is locked.
     lm85 0-002e: Client (0,0x2e) is not ready.
     lm85 0-002e: Client (0,0x2e) VxI mode is set. Please report this to the lm85 maintainer.
Looking at /var/log/messages I also can see multiple entries of:
     i2c_adapter i2c-0: SMBus collision!
Any idea what is causing this and what I can do to remove the problem?
Who is the lm85 maintainer? In MAINTANERS I only found LM80 and LM83. In
lm85.c there is Justin Thiessen <jthiessen@penguincomputing.com> in the
Copyright, but failed to contact him.
Thanks,
Holger
