Nope, nothing else. That's pretty much it.

That's what I was thinking. The wait_list locks could be the lock that
is used to replace the pi_lock.

Yeah this is sort of what I was thinking of when I follow the
lock->task->lock route.
Here's a visual:
X=> : blocked on
->  : owned by
P1 X=> L1 -+
       ^   |
P2 X===+   |
           |
           +->P4 X=> L3 -> P5
           |
P3 X=> L2 -+
So P4 owns locks L1 and L2 with tasks P1 and P2 blocked on L1 and P3
blocked on L2.  And P4 is blocked on lock L3 owned by P5.
This has the following lists:
L1->wait_list => P1 => P2
L2->wait_list => P3
L3->wait_list => P4
P4->pi_waiters => P1 => P2 => P3
P5->pi_waiters => P4
OK, we add another lock to the task that protects the pi_waiters.
Always grab this lock _after_ grabbing all the necessary wait_locks.
So when P5 needs to update it's pi_waiters, it first grabs the
L3->wait_lock, and then the P5->pi_lock.
So when blocking on a lock, you would grab the lock->wait_locks of all
the locks that you are blocked on.  When P2 blocked on a L1 it would
have grabbed (in this order) L1->wait_lock, L3->wait_lock, P4->pi_lock. 
Actually, for simplicity, since the pi_lock is associated to the task,
we may be able to safely grab the task pi_lock before a wait_lock. Say
if we have P5 blocked on L4 owned by P6.  When updating the
P4->pi_waiters (say when P2 blocked on L1), we could do this:
Grab L1->wait_lock, L3->wait_lock, P4->pi_lock, L4->wait_lock.  Since we
should never be grabbing the L4->wait_lock (or higher) when grabbing the
P4->pi_lock.
God, I think a thesis can be made out of this.  Well, let me start
coding, since I'm one of those that write code better than I design.
I'm a Spiral type of guy, not a Waterfall one ;-)
Code crap, write about it, recode it as gold!
