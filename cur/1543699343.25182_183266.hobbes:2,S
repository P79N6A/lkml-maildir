Linus:
Okay, can you add to the approved license list "GPL/proprietary" and
"proprietary/GPL" ?
This would allow a legal shim for the hardcare folks to choke down, and
provide the comfort level for others.
Then the trick is when does the license flip modes?
Compile time?
Execution time?
This starts to become more fuzzy than I care to look at right now.
Cheers,
