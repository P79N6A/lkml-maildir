It is a old problem from what I understand.
However it would still be nice to have it fixed for 2.6.14.

It seems we need internal ide_dev_do_request(ide_drive_t *, int)
which will explicitly state which device we want to service as I see
no sane way to fix the problem in choose_drive().
Your workaround is OK for 2.6.14 given that you will document it
now and later fix it properly for 2.6.15.
