Ahh, ok. I did wonder if something was up from the timing (ie it was 
loaded almost two minutes after bootup).
Since you are apparently a git user, and 2.6.28-rc6-00007-ged31348 was 
fine, there's really only 270 commits in between that and 2.6.28-rc7. Can 
I ask you to bisect for a couple of runs, which would cut it down to a 
handful? (Ie you don't even need to do a full bisect, although that should 
really only require about 8 reboots).
Just do
	git bisect start
	git bisect bad v2.6.27
	git bisect good v2.6.28-rc6-00007-ged31348
and off you go. That would help enormously.
There are very few console-related changes in that range, and the most 
notably one is actually radeon-specific so it shouldn't be an issue for 
you. I'd _suspect_ bca404afdc5206c3bb30168315ee8a98a579ec65 ("fbdev: fix 
FB console blanking"), but quite frankly, it could be something random 
that just interacted badly. A bisection would narrow things down.
