Yes. It is different in different kernels. If you are using base 2.6.18,
then you still need both the drivers.
If you are using mm (slated to go to base kernel in future) then both
are required.
Couple of things that will help in root causing this:
1) Enable CPU_FREQ_DEBUG and boot with "cpufreq.debug=7" and capture the
dmesg.
2) Capture acpidump (You can find acpidump in latest version of pmtools
here 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
 )
and send the output to me.
Better still, open a bug in bugme.osdl.org in ACPI category. That will
help us to track this failure better and close on it quicker.
Thanks,
Venki
