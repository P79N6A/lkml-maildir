So you are another APIC victim :)
The funny thing, is that I thought that because, 
Linus has write :
"It's entirely possible that the SCI is just horribly broken, and can't
be level-triggered" about "ACPI: IRQ 9 was Edge Triggered, setting to
Level Triggerd".
And thinking, can be true ? that, if SCI can't be level-triggered (like
my laptop and yours), kernel with APIC (loapic or smp) options will hang
on boot !
