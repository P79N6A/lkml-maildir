I think that you are looking at this issue too much from a CKRM point of 
view.  I.e. just because CKRM doesn't need it doesn't mean that it isn't 
  a good idea.  In fact the issue should be viewed more broadly than 
just a "resource management" point of view.
If there are multiple clients then having their per KernelObject data 
managed using the PAGG mechanism greatly simplifies the task of 
implementing a client AND reduces the potential overhead on the system 
as the alternative is for the client to use some type of search 
mechanism to find its copy of its per KernelObject specific data when 
servicing its callback functions.

I think that this is just a detail and that what should happen is that a 
PAGG like mechanism be applied to sockets.  Similarly, to enable memory 
management/monitoring one attached to address space structures would be 
useful.  And so on.

I think that breaking these up into smaller chunks (based on the type of 
KernelObject to which they apply) would be a good idea.  The fact that 
CKRM wants to use them all isn't sufficient justification to lump them 
all together.

I think that this is another example of you taking a too CKRM centric 
point of view.  What I'm trying to say is that I think that these lower 
level interfaces need to be more independent of CKRM's requirements.
