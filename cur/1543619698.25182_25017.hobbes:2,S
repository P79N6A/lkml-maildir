Very interesting and approachable patch.  Am I correct this replaces the API 
for starting threads like bdflush and kswapd?  Is this just an API 
cleanliness thing or is there a performance motivation?
Just one question....

Do you think you could get by just passing struct task_struct here?  I 
realize that would make it less pleasant for calling functions.  However, it 
would also prevent you from changing something else in the kthread in a later 
version and catching a caller by surprise.
Otherwise, looks nice to my naive eyes :)
