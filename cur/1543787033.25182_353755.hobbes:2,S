Hello All,
A friend of mine has a Toshiba Satellite M35X-S163 and have got RedHat
Linux ES(2.6.9-5.EL). Everytime he boots his computer hangs and shows
the following info:
Booting Red Hat Linux ES (2.6.9-5.EL)
root (hd0,4)
  Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
Kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.9-5.EL ro root=LABEL=/ rhgb quiet

initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.9-5.EL.img
   [Linux-initrd @ 0x1dc6f000, 0x60592 bytes]
Uncompression Linux.... OK, booting the Kernel
   audit(1127830961 506:0): initialized
Kernel panic-not syncing: drivers/ide/pci/piix.c:390:
   spin_lock(drivers/ide/ide.c:c036b8e8) already locked by

If you have an idea on how to help it is greatly appreciated.
