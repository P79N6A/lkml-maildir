You can't even compile a kernel with that combination ...
Just about every arch except ia64 turns off ARCH_FLATMEM_ENABLE if NUMA=y.
ia64 can just do the same thing.  Instead of mucking around with select,
fix the bug at its source. The real culprit is in mm/Kconfig, it shouldn't
enable ARCH_FLATMEM_ENABLE if NUMA=y.
Fix ARCH_FLATMEM_ENABLE dependency in ia64 arch.
