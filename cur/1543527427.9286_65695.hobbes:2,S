I have the same problem. X seems to constantly take at least 30% CPU, even
if nothing is should irritate it. At first, X takes 0-1% when idle, but
after 1-2 days of use, the percentage raises to ~30% until I restart X.
Xmms also takes 5-15% even if it is not playing anything (paused/stopped).
I use 2.2.14 and BP6 (2x466Celeron).
ISRT others have reported this sort of thing on the Abit-linux mailing
lists as well.
