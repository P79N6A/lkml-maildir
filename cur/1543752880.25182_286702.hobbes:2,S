marking them volatile does not protect across cpus.  Just using a normal
atomic_t will work properly.

Just use atomic_t and don't mess with volatile.  See the archives for
why that (volatile) doesn't work like that.

No it doesn't, why do your own version of this function with the
barrier() function?

So these can just be removed, and the code changed to use the proper
atomic calls?  If so, please do so.
