You really must have bad luck with your entropy...
01:05 ichi:/home/k > cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
3596
01:08 ichi:/home/k > dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null bs=3596 count=1
1+0 records in

however that might be caused because I am in X, mouse moves, kernel 
compiles, etc.

Disk activities are "somewhat predictable", like network traffic, and 
hence are not (or should not - have not checked it) contribute to the 
pool. Note that urandom is the device which _always_ gives you data, and 
when the pool is exhausted, returns pseudorandom data.

[I have] No memories about a kernel this old. :>
