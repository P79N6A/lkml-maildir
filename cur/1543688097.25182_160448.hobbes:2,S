I haven't been ignoring you. I've been trying to figure exactly what 
you're talking about. Do you have a concrete example? Is it some PCMCIA 
driver, or some platform driver? 
I fail to see the problem, in theory, besides the driver itself. In the
case where the driver registers first, ->probe() will not be called until
it matches a device, which implies the device will have been added before
->probe() is called.
Also, I think I initially misunderstood your vocabulary. Each SIBLING is a
sibling of one another, but are CHILDREN of the PARENT. Right?

Hey, I hadn't finished that part, because I considered fixing the system 
power management interface more important that day. 
It works like this: 
- A driver is able to set ->power.pm_parent for a device by calling 
  device_pm_set_parent() after its registered. By default, pm_parent is 
  set to the phsyical parent of the device. 
- A device with other devices that are dependent on it for power has a 
  positive pm_users count. 
- A device may only be suspended when pm_users == 0. 
- When a device is suspended, the pm_users count of its pm_parent is 
  decremented, and incremented when the device is resumed. 
- device_suspend() makes multiple passes over the device list, in case
  power dependencies cause some devices to be deferred. It fails with an 
  error (and resumes all suspended devices) if a pass was made in which 
  no devicse were suspended, but there are still devices with a positive
  pm_users count. 
Sound good?
