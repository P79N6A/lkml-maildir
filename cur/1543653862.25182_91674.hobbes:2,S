In that case I suppose you could iterate through all possible
tail sizes. In any case, Reiserfs 4 is coming. Reiserfs 4 shifts
the tree all over.

Same effect though: only the filesystem driver can know how
to overwrite a file.

They must. I suppose that might not be implemented yet.

By "protect against root" of course I mean a future cracked box
or the drive put into another machine.
LVM has to cooperate. If it can't, then that's a bug. Snapshots
count the same as keeping backups on separate media. Likewise,
fsck and defraggers need to cooperate.
