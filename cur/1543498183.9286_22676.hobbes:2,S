	Export restrictions exist for many countries. The USA and its current

btw. (I havent heard back from the maintainer on this.) What happened to
stego? I dont see it in the 2.2.9 kerneli patches. Work was done on this
for 2.0.x kernels, and I would be interested in migrating it to 2.2.x.
Any info appreciated.
