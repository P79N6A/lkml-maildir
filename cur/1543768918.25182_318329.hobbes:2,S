iirc problem is that gcc 2.95 and possibly 3.0.x have some known
miscompilations with regparams. That is why it was only used
with fastcall for a long time. One 3.1.x+ it should be safe.
But you cannot express dependencies on the compiler version
in Kconfig right now.
Of course getting rid of gcc 2.95 and 3.0.x support would be a good idea,
that would allow many other nice things.
