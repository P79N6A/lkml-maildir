Okay. So IBM gets the evil GPL v3, but the existing code is still covered
by v2 so IBM gives me the propritary software with the v2 licence (they
can't actually change what licence the code is under) but I choose not to
accept the v3 licence and stay with v2. What now? Does the GPL give legal
recourse to the recipitent when the sender doesn't follow through or must
the orignal author take action?
