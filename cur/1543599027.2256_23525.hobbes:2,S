Mr. LaHaise,
	Eeek! Sorry. That was just a preliminary. As I see it, there are
several ways to wire this up:
	- make everyone use the new macros (some people are thinking :P)
	- make everyone use #ifdef blocks with a config option (you think it's :P)
	- make min()/max() typeof() wrappers for a switch-style stack of comparison 
	  functions which work on the various types, i.e:
	
	  __u8 minimum = min(one, two) -> __u8 minimum = __u8_min(one, two)
	  (this may be too complex and is probably :P)
	- make min()/max() inline functions, cast things to void, and use memcmp()
	  (this sounds reasonable, but is probably also :P)
	- stay with the old-style macros (:P, :P, :P)
	What do you think, sir?
Brad
