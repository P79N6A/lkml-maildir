Had a thought.  Why wait for a compression algorithm?  Jorn, if you are going
to work on putting the code into the kernel and making the stuff to allow the
swap code to use it, why not start coding it before the compression code is
finished?  i.e. get the stuff down for the swap filtering (filtering i.e. passing
through a compression or encryption routine) and swap-on-ram stuff, and later
take the compression algo code and place the module interface on it and make
a kernel module.
At this point, I'd say to allow specified order filters, to allow for swap cyphering
and compression.  Security, you know; swap files are a security hazard.  Just
power-off, boot a root disk, pull up the swap partition, rip out the blocks, and
look for what looks to be the root password.
