Nope. I grep for assignments to other members of that struct.

There are still statically allocated structs left. So neither heuristic 
for figuring out initialization points is perfect.

No disagreement here.

Well, yes, but for initialization, I would prefer something like what Al 
Viro suggested. To me, initialization is a separate issue from kmalloc. I 
do get your point but I just don't think sizeof(struct foo) is the answer.
In all completeness, I would personally prefer the following form for 
allocation and initialization which is readable, easy to get right, and 
highly greppable:
	struct foo *p = kmalloc(sizeof *p, ...);
	*p = (struct foo) {
		.bar = ...;
	};
Unfortunately it doesn't seem like gcc is doing such a good job with it.
