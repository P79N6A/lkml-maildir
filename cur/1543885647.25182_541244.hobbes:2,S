I agree that it's really sad that anyone applies his own caprice in source
code which is supposed to be used by anybody. Next time this crap will
appear in printks and we will say "hey, it's documentation". It would be
better to stick to the common denominator. Some people like Davem insist
a lot on respecting the 80 columns limit for good reason. We should also
respect the charset supported by the same terminals.
Otherwise, if anything is allowed in comments, I don't see why we should
not start to put ASCII art "just for fun", since I do not see any justified
use of the UTF8 on the code above.
And no, I won't upgrade my system to get UTF8 support.
