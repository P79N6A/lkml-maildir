I'm seeing many of these on dmesg, almost everytime a module is getting
loaded:
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context insmod(1357) at

Another critical issue is that USB is not working properly; the ohci_hcd
module gets loaded but devices don't get listed by lsusb at all, which I
think is a "bonus" from upstream 2.6.9-rc1-mm3.
In fact I think -mm3 is breaking many things around here, at least on my
laptop; another notorious is my wifi stuff (linux-wlan-ng/prism2_cs) now
failing due to unresolved symbols, such as these:
prism2_cs: Unknown symbol p80211netdev_rx
prism2_cs: Unknown symbol register_wlandev
prism2_cs: Unknown symbol wlan_unsetup
prism2_cs: Unknown symbol unregister_wlandev
prism2_cs: Unknown symbol p80211netdev_hwremoved
prism2_cs: Unknown symbol wlan_setup
prism2_cs: Unknown symbol p80211skb_rxmeta_attach
But I guess this is off-topic by now.
Take care.
