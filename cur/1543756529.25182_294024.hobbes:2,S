Larry has said, write up a proposal for changes you want in bk. Send
it to him for a quote. Come up with the cash and he will do the work.
All I see is a bunch of complaints and no concrete proposal for the
work to be done.
He has provided a legal means for achieving what the complainers want
done. So stop complaining and start writing the proposal.
