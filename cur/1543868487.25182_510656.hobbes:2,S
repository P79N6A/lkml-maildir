Man, I am batting 1000!  Randy also made fun of my 'intead'.

Yeah, this seemed to be the lesser of the available evils.  We (Chris  
and I, while in california) considered introducing a primitive to  
have the submission path wait for aio_complete() to be called so that  
it could just return the error.  We also thought about turning EIOCB 
{RETRY,QUEUED} into bits on the iocb instead of return codes that we  
have to lovingly pass back up to fs/aio.c.
This seemed to be the least intrusive :/.
