I see.  Yes, getting involved in the kernel updgrade cycle _is_ a
hassle.  I had assumed that you people were tracking 2.4.  I apologise
for the heavy handedness.
If you are running an RPM-based system you may find it easier to use
Jeff Garzik's `hackkernel' distributions.  You'll need to grab the
.src.rpm so it can be patched.  But it's probably better from a
repeatability point of view to grab 2.4.0-test3, patch it up to pre4 and
go for it.
I'll send the world's shortest kernel-building-HOWTO to l-a-d in a
moment :)

From a quick peek at the ALSA site it would seem that they are tracking
2.3 and perhaps 2.4 - the linux-audio-dev denizens would know more about
that?
