Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Early console/printk patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello all,
        The following is a patch which provides early printk support.
It provides a way to add a console in seup_arch and then
automatically have it removed just before the real console is added.
It provides a way to debug kernels that don't boot past console_init
or that overflow the temp buffer.  It also provides 3 simple consoles
for i386 (mainly vga and serial) that support write.  It allows you to
just make printk calls and see them on your console before
console_init.
         A big piece of the patch was written by William Irwin and had
been previously submitted by him (NOV 2001).  The patch is against
a base 2.4.17 but should be easy to apply against other versions of
the kernel.
Please let us know what you think about getting this into the kernel.
