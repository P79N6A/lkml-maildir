Here is an example that you may wish to comment on...
It is from the scsi generic driver (lk >= 2.3.43). Its
newly introduced "procfs" directory looks like this:
$ ls /proc/scsi/sg
debug              device_hdr   devices   host_strs  version
def_reserved_size  device_strs  host_hdr  hosts
The 2 major abstractions in the scsi subsystem are hosts and 
devices. There are potentially several of each with both numerical
and character data associated with each element:
$ cd /proc/scsi/sg
$ cat host_strs
AdvanSys SCSI 3.2M: ISA PnP 16 CDB: BIOS C800, IO 120/F, IRQ 10, DMA 7
AdvanSys SCSI 3.2M: PCI Ultra-Wide: BIOS D8000/7FFF, IO E400/3F, IRQ 11
SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
Iomega VPI2 (imm) interface
$ cat host_hdr hosts
uid     busy    cpl     scatg   isa     emul
0       0       0       50      1       0
0       0       0       255     0       0
0       0       5       256     0       1
0       0       1       255     0       0 
The first "cat" shows the host strings obtained from the drivers where
the line number corresponds to scsi0, scsi1, etc (or in devfs: host0,
host1, etc). The second "cat" first outputs a column header (host_hdr)
mainly for human consumption while 'hosts' outputs a line of numerical 
data for each host.
The device data follows a similar pattern:
$ cat device_strs 
YAMAHA          CRW4416S                1.0g
IBM             DCHS04U                 2727
IOMEGA          ZIP 100                 P.05
$ cat device_hdr devices
host    chan    id      lun     type    discon  qdepth  tq
0       0       6       0       5       0       4       0
1       0       0       0       0       0       63      0
3       0       6       0       0       0       1       0
The row numbers of devices correspond to sg0, sg1, etc [which are
also the minor device numbers]. Alternatively devfs refers to the
first row as: /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target6/lun0/generic .
Perhaps the only other interesting thing here is the representation
of the version to aid decoding:
$ cat version
30112   Version: 3.1.12 (20000222)
There is a compromise here between human and machine readable forms. 
Also changes (e.g. devfs renaming scsi channels and ids to buses and 
targets respectively) can be accommodated without too much pain to 
scripts trying to decode numerical information.
