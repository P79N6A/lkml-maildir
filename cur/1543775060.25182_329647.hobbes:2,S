You can do this in Mercurial as well.

Have fun with that. It's an excellent way to destroy your DVD drive.
Git's completely structureless filename hashing pretty much guarantees
that disk layout will degrade to worst-case random access behavior
over time. Just walking through the 2000 commit blobs in the current
tree can take minutes cold cache on a fast hard disk. Walking the 1700
tree blobs in a given version takes quite a while too.
Put that on a DVD and that could easily turn into hours of continuous
seeking for a simple operation like checking out tip of tree.
And as far as I know, ISO9660 and UDF don't really handle huge
directories well. So if you try and put the whole kernel history (200k
files, some huge number of directory blobs, and 30k-60k commit blobs)
on a DVD, you'll be really hurting.
Meanwhile the whole history (>30k changesets) with Mercurial fits on a
regular CD, with reasonable directory sizes and I/O patterns.
Not that it's really worth the trouble. It takes longer for me to burn
an ISO image to disc than to download a complete kernel repo from
kernel.org.
