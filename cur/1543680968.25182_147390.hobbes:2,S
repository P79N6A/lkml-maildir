Hi,
just took me half a hour to figure out. On nforce2 you have to disable 
agp fastwrites, otherwise X locks hard on startup with the following 
(from serial console).
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected NVIDIA nForce2 chipset
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 816M
agpgart: AGP aperture is 128M @ 0xd0000000
[drm] Initialized radeon 1.9.0 20020828 on minor 0
agpgart: Found an AGP 2.0 compliant device at 0000:00:00.0.
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 0000:00:00.0 into 2x mode
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 0000:02:00.0 into 2x mode
No response, neither by ping, nor sysrq or anything else. just dead.
I already defined AGP_DEBUG in agp.h but that doesn't make it noisier.
# lspci -v
02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon R200 QL 
[Radeon )

         I/O ports at a000 [size=256]
         Memory at e2000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]

         Capabilities: [58] AGP version 2.0

Without AGP Fastwrites turned on, it all works wonderful. Just if 
anybody encounters the same problem.
Mainboard is nForce2 based, graphics is radeon 8500le (R200).
