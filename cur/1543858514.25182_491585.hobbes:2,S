I'm not saying that I would do it, but it's the way how it would be 
done if anyone would do it.
It's not about whether that would be good or bad, the point is that the 
ones that will most likely be affected if anyone will ever take legal 
actions will not be the big distributions but people selling their old 
distributions on Ebay or people operating mirrors.
Cease and desist letters are a lucrative business for lawyers here in 
Germany, and such grey areas are simply a timebomb waiting for lawyers 
and/or people wanting to harm Linux to (ab)use them.
