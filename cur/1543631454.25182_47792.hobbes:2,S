We are worried about the same thing :)  
I can add a nice comment to binfmt_elf.c explaining why the current->mmap_sem 
isn't taken in elf_core_dump.  
( I find comments for code that's not there a bit more confusing than 
comments for code that is there.   I'll try to come up with something 
meaningful as a comment to the lack of locking policy in elf_core_dump for my 
next posting.)
The only risk I can see of oopsing is if some of the user pages get taken 
away while the core dump is progressing.  With the other processes in the 
thread group suspended, not holding the  mmap_sem, I truly believe we are 
good.
I'd like to avoid over locking where no clear need exists.  I understand that 
this may be the more risky position to take, but I believe its the right 
thing to do.  Especially on a development kernel.
