ALSA is used for other things _too_.
I don't think SECCOMP is wrong per se, but I do believe that if other 
approaches become more popular, and the only user of SECCOMP is not GPL'd 
and uses some patented stuff, then we should seriously look at the other 
interfaces (eg the extended ptrace).
Does anybody actually really _use_ SECCOMP outside of the patented stuff?
