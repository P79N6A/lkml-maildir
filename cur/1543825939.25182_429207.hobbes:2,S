Always by the current process which holds console_sem.  Leaving the printing
for the next process would be unacceptably too late for printk.
If printk sees that someone holds console_sem, printk will leave the data
in the log buffer for the current holder of console_sem to print, prior to
that caller releasing console_sem.  logbuf_log is used in tricky ways
around console_sem to prevent races in this logic.
