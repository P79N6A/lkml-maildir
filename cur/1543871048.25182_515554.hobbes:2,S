Subject: [patch 1/1] ppc: Possible bug fix for FCC driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Cedric Pontois <cpontois@nortel.com>
We use a kernel 2.6.14 on PPC platform (MPC 8555). The FCC driver works
well with a 100Mbps link. But it doesn't with a 10Mbps link. To solve
it, I modified the GFMR register init: removed TCI bit and set CRC32 bit
instead of.
