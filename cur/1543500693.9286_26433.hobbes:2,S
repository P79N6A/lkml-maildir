Hi folks!
I just ran some performance comparisons between 2.2.10 and 2.3.8.
For both kernel versions I used a freshly rebooted system, and started
KDE, x11amp, and xosview. The tests were performed on a plain RedHat 6.0 
system, using dual Celerons running at 366 MHz, 128 MB of RAM and a IDE
hard disk drive. Both kernels were compiled with the same config options.
The test was run as follows: A freshly configured kernel source tree
was used (The exact same source tree was used for the test both under 
2.2.10 and 2.3.8). Then I used make clean to remove old object files 
and other left overs. Finally, to measure system performance, I typed
        time make -j 8 bzImage
The test was repeated three times for each kernel.
Here are the results:
2.2.10: 
        First test run:  285s user, 26.58s system, 3:30 elapsed
        Second test run: 287s user, 27s    system, 3:29 elapsed
        Third test run:  289s user, 26.86s system, 3:29 elapsed
2.3.8:
        First test run:  298s user, 29.8s  system, 3:44 elapsed
        Second test run: 290s user, 29.7s  system, 3:35 elapsed
        Third test run:  297s user, 29.4s  system, 3:36 elapsed
I also observed the following: While I did run into swap when I ran the test
under 2.2.10, swapping did not occur under 2.3.8. This makes it even more
surprising that 2.3.8 came out slower than 2.2.10, especially after the
announcement, that 2.3.8 came with speed improvements for SMP systems.
Does anybody have similar (or contradicting) results ?
Cheers
Rudi
PS: It is clear that those are not absolute benchmarks of performance. But
I do think that parallel kernel compiles test the scheduler and the file 
system, and I think these numbers are at least a good indication of performance.
