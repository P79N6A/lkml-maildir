I have a much simpler proposal, which appears to solve your
immediate problem, and would keep most people happy -- add a:
C: CONFIG_SCSI_BLARG
tag to MAINTAINERS.  If you _really_ insist, add an:
F: drivers/scsi/blarg.c
F: drivers/scsi/blarg.h
too.  It removes the ambiguity inherent in the current system,
without adding an overengineered solution with no obvious
advantages.
