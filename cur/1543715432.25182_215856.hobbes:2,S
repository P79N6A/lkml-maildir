Len,
 when booting without "acpi=off" it shows indeed some ACPI Interrupts:
cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:      31464          XT-PIC  timer
  1:        570          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  3:          5          XT-PIC  HiSax
  8:          2          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:       1197          XT-PIC  acpi
 10:       1695          XT-PIC  eth0, usb-uhci, Texas Instruments
 PCI1420, Texas Instruments PCI1420 (#2)
 12:       5460          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
 14:      18052          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:         11          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0
ERR:          0
 When booting with "acpi=off", as well as with 2.4.23 it shown no acpi
interrupts (not really surprising).
