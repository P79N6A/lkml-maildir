Exactly.
Please let me clarify what you are going to.
1) standard kernel: reserve a small contigous area for a dump kernel
   (this is not changed as the current code)
2) standard kernel: export the information of valid physical memory
   regions. (/proc/iomem or /proc/cpumem etc.)
3) kexec (system call?): store the information of valid physical memory
   regions as ELF program header to the reserved area (mentioned 1)).
4) standard kernel: when a panic occur, append (ex.) the register
   information as ELF note after the memory information (if necessary).
   and jump new kernel
5) dump kernel: export all valid physical memory (and saved register
   information) to the user. (as /dev/oldmem /proc/vmcore ?)
Is this correct ?  one question: how the dump kernel know the saved
area of ELF headers ?
one more question: I don't understand what the 640K backup area is. 
Please let me know why it is necessary.
Thanks.
