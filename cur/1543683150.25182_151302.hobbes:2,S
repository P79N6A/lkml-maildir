radeon is still broken. Looks obvious since it was broken for me
  since -pre6, and -pre8 didn't change anything apparently... but
  I decided to give -pre8 a spin anyway.
To my surprise, the framebuffer didn't go wild as it happened in
  earlier occasions - as in here:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0307.2/0732.html
However, firing startx resulted in a black screen and a hard hang
  (had to keep the poweroff button for 10" to actually power off).
So I tried booting -pre8 again, and this time the framebuffer went
  wild again. It looks like there is a timing issue perhaps ?
I'm available for testing and debugging this - so far I'm stuck
  with -pre4 which is the latest working.
Thanks in advance for any help/insight.
