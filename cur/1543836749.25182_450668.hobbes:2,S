Excellent points.

Agreed. But this is only a heuristic; maybe in this case nothing fishy
is going on, whereas many nice-looking patches would reek to heaven if
inspected more closely.
So how about exercising judgment? Look up the tp_smapi development
history on sf.net (under project "tpctl"), the relevant posts on
thinkpad-devel, hdaps-devel and even a bit on lkml, and see if this
looks like standard, clean kernel development or a sinister attempt to
steal our precious bolidy fluids.
