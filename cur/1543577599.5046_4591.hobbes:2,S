<br>Setiathome 3.03 and 3.x most likely causes the ip_conntrack errors
which quickly brings the system to a screetching network halt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I suggest nobody run setiathome on their firewall/gateway/router if they're
using iptables with 2.4.x.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sure how it causes this error
nor would it matter to me since i wouldn't be able to recode the client
anyway.&nbsp; I'm sure there are setiathome developers (at least one) paying
attention to this list.&nbsp; The client is broken.

<p>This makes it impossible to make any sort of network socket connection
<br>and all prior connections died.&nbsp; As i said you cannot remove the
module
<br>to reset ip_conntrack and i'm not sure what could have caused this
as it
<br>did work up until i woke up this morning, with a total running time
of
<br>about 10 hours or so.&nbsp; I'd consider this bug rather important,
if anyone
<br>thinks this is not an ip_conntrack bug and rather something that has
<br>changed that i havn't read about, help would be nice. :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i have been
<br>using iptables since it came out though and ip_conntrack has only been
<br>bad once before,&nbsp;&nbsp; on test5 when it wouldn't kill old dead
socket
<br>connections and eventually starved itself of free sockets.
