Hi all
I noticed that in current linux kernel versions (2.6.11), some basic 
functions are out of line (not inlined)
Example of a call to spin_unlock(&somelock)
c01069fa:   b8 e8 7b 35 c0          mov    $0xc0357be8,%eax
c01069ff:   e8 3c e4 1f 00          call   c0304e40 <_spin_unlock>
c0304e40 <_spin_unlock>:
c0304e40:   c6 00 01                movb   $0x1,(%eax)
c0304e43:   c3                      ret
Same problem for _write_unlock(), _read_unlock(), _spin_unlock_irq(), ...
That seems odd, and I fail to see the reason for that. (It's OK for 
complex functions, but not for very short ones...)
Is it a regression, or is it needed ?
configuration :
	- SMP
	- Processor family (Pentium-4/Celeron(P4-based)/Pentium-4 M/Xeon)
	- No "Generic x86 support"
Thank you
