It's all encapsulated in the libpthread which is used.  No apps need to
be recompiled so it is OK to make this incompatible change.

I cannot see any reasonable way out if any of the put_user calls fail?
Do you want the clone() call to fail if the parent's receiving address
is wrong?  You'd have to go and kill the child again since it's already
created.
Instead let the user initialize the memory location the clone call is
supposed to write in with zero.  if the value didn't change the
user-level code can detect the error and handle appropriately.  So,
ignore the put_user errors.  Maybe say so explicitly and add (void) in
front.
