Will look at that.

Ok, just needed to have a confirmation. Of course I will keep the 
compatibility with the BSD format. But since there are several unused 
bytes in the dump structure, I might use them to store some specific
filesystem (or inode) information (I think of acl etc.). Old linux restore
programs (or the BSD ones) will only see the 'generic' unix filesystem/inode
information, but newer restores could be able to use the specific information.
Thanks.
Stelian.
