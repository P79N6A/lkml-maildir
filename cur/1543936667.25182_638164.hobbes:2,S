I beg to disagree.  There is a very common (idiomatic) way for
doing this kind of calculation and the first/original expression
is in that form, although it's a little difficult to recognize.
This common formula lives in linux/kernel.h:
#define DIV_ROUND_UP(n,d) (((n) + (d) - 1) / (d))
where n is (AFAIK) numerator and d is divisor.
Example:  One use of this is in linux/bitops.h:
#define BITS_TO_LONGS(nr)	DIV_ROUND_UP(nr, BITS_PER_LONG)
This macro returns the number of longs that it takes to hold
'nr' bits.  Expanded, it looks like:
nr_longs = (nr_bits + BITS_PER_LONG - 1) / BITS_PER_LONG;
The idiomatic formula handles boundary conditions very nicely.
Now for PIDMAP_ENTRIES, use 8 * PAGE_SIZE as the (d) part of
DIV_ROUND_UP() and you can see that it is done correctly.
