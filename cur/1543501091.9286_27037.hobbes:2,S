Actually its the odds and ends that tend to get fixed fast. The stuff
that is hard is things that affect a few users, reproducably but not most
people and not devlopers. They can be real pigs to sort out.
Some of us keep logs too. My tracking db is currently 35838036 bytes 8)
I can pretty much summarise most pending common bugs down to about 5 or 6
including some that Im tentatively expecting DaveM's fixing of the tcp
bucket stuff to fix.
