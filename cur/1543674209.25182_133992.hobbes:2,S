Looks like this oops occurred right next to a list_for_each in which I
demultiplex the received network response from the server and try to match
it against one of the pending requests in the list.  No obvious reason was
this should oops and access to the list is spinlock protected.   The
location reminds me of the problems with prefetch that Jon Grimm and Andi
were mentioning.

Although one of the three newer cifs changesets at
bk://cifs.bkbits.net/linux-2.5cifs (changeset 1.1115) adds missing spinlock
protection for modifications to the one list that was missing spinlocks
(the cifs open file list) and changes a list_for_each to list_for_each_safe
in one case where releasing the spinlock temporarily was necessary, which
does fix a different oops, none of the three pending cifs vfs changesets
are likely to affect this problem.   This one looks unrelated and plausibly
similar to the other two reports of general prefetch problems mentioned in
earlier posts.
