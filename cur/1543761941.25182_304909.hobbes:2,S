Have you analyzed the use of mutexes/condvars in the program?
The primary suspect is a deadlock, race of some kind or other bug
in the program.  All these will show up as a hang in FUTEX_WAIT.
The argument that it works with LinuxThreads doesn't count,
the timing and internals of both threading libraries are so different
that a program bug can only show up with one of the threading libraries
and not both.
Only once you distill a minimal self-contained testcase that proves
the program is correct and it gets analyzed, it is time to talk about
NPTL or kernel bugs.
