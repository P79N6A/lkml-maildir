Subject: [PATCH] discontigmem support for ia32 NUMA box against 2.4.20pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Please consider this patch for inclusion into the next 2.4.20pre release.
This patch provides generic discontiguous memory support for the i386
numa architecture.  The patch also provides supports for the ia32 IBM
NUMA-Q hardware platform.  John Stultz also has added support for the
x440 hardware... which he'll post soon.
This patch depends on the three patches that I just sent out (modularization 
of setup_arch(), modularization of mem_init(), and paddr -> pfn patches).
Assumptions made: 
        - that the first node has at least 900Mb of memory
Testing done: 
        - single proc desktop pc (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set)
        - 4 proc SMP system (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set)
        - 4 proc SMP system (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA is not set)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA is not set, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 8 proc NUMA box with 8GB memeory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
	- 16 proc NUMA box with 16GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
Any and all feedback regarding this patch is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Pat
