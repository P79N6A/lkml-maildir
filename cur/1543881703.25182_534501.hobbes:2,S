It is possible, I suppose. Is what you're working on open-source? If so, 
you could send it to me and I could try and reproduce it here and track it 
down. If you want me to, that is. (If you do send, please include a 
".config".)
Otherwise, I couldn't tell you what it might be. Make sure all your 
messages end with '\n', make sure you're not accidentally using the wrong 
formatting codes and it's backing over previous output with ^H or 
something. You could confirm or rule out the possibility of overflowing 
the printk buffers by writing a dummy module with a tight loop of nothing 
but printk statements with counters to see if you can get it to asplode.
