Well, that piece of ***** chipset will ONLY work if you talk to it through
the VESA BIOS in a laptop I have here.  This is fine for XFree86 (we used
the VESA driver), but I don't know if this would work for the kernel VESA
framebuffer driver.
The SiS drivers will basicaly screw your hardware up. You *must* talk to it
through the BIOS, or it will not manage to get the video/LCD timings right or
even hung the PCI bus. Smells like the chipset needs extra data that the
current drivers do not know how to set.

Lucky you. Our laptop got a PCI buffer hung out of the deal.

Indeed. We need fully updated docs from SiS on how to deal with their newest
"contribution" to the onboard-video family.
