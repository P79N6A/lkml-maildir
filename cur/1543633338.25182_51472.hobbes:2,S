So is the consensus now that in general drivers should make sure any
buffers passed to pci_map/unmap are aligned to SMP_CACHE_BYTES (and a
multiple of SMP_CACHE_BYTES in size)?  In other words if a driver uses
an unaligned buffer it should be fixed unless we can prove (and
document in a comment :) that it won't cause problems on an arch
without cache coherency and with a writeback cache.
Thanks,
  Roland
