I really just want to edit serial.c, anf have just serial.c compile.
But when it comes to Linux-2.2.12-20 (  from RedHat ), a lot more .c
routines get built.
It would seem that the dependencies for linux et al are too dependent on
each other ! Is this a bug, or just a way to convince folks with slow &
workable machines to upgrade ?
On a 486, this is a painful way to edit the serial.c driver !
