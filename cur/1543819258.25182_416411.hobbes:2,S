Well, posting source code is a good first step.
What kernel are you attempting to port this to? 2.6.16 / head, I presume?

PageReserved is deprecated, however it makes sense to leave these in
for the moment so you get a little more sanity checking and easier
backwards compatibility.

You should never access _count directly. There should be no reason to
do this (except for introducing use-after-free), so just delete it.

Shouldn't this be vmalloc(size)?

shouldn't this be ->image_table? and vmalloc(size)?

I'm pretty sure you can't remap_pfn_range vmalloced memory because
it doesn't use contiguous page frames.
You'd be better off going through the pages one by one and running
vm_insert_page on each (or remap_pfn_range on each pageframe, if you
need to be compatible with kernels before 2.6.16).
Also, don't use io_remap on vmalloc memory, just remap.

If creg_phys is io memory, that's when you'd use io_remap, I think.
