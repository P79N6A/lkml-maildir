Hello,
We can always keep in sync with the current Linus tree through his git
tree. But from where can we keep in sync with the current -mm tree?
ie, when somethings added to -mm, how do we get that too?
The only way now seems to check the mm-commits list. Is it possible to
expose akpm's working folder somewhere for convenience?
