ok - i guess the reason here that we never triggered it in -rt is that 
-EDEADLK is a really rare case that only occurs with pi-futexes (and 
even then, only with buggy userspace or with intentional testcases). 
Plus, lockdep caught most/all of the in-kernel deadlocks before this 
mechanism could catch it.
