i was trying to study various cpu & i/o bottlenecks for a backup
tool (rdiff-backup) and i stumbled into this oddity:
# time xargs -0 -n100 cat -- > /dev/null < /tmp/filelist
0.520u 5.310s 0:36.92 15.7%     0+0k 0+0io 11275pf+0w
# time xargs -0 -n100 cat -- > /dev/null < /tmp/filelist
0.510u 5.090s 0:35.05 15.9%     0+0k 0+0io 11275pf+0w
# time xargs -0 -P2 -n100 cat -- > /dev/null < /tmp/filelist
0.500u 5.380s 1:30.51 6.4%      0+0k 0+0io 11275pf+0w
# time xargs -0 -P2 -n100 cat -- > /dev/null < /tmp/filelist
0.420u 4.810s 1:36.73 5.4%      0+0k 0+0io 11275pf+0w
3x slower with the two cats in parallel.
these particular measurements were taken on this system:
	linux 2.4.19-pre10-ac2
	SMP dual P3 500MHz
	512MB PC100 memory
	promise ultra100/tx2
	maxtor 5400rpm 80GB disk
the filelist has 25400 files totalling 1700MB (two copies of
my ~/mail).
i thought it might be that the /dev/null file is shared amongst
the two parallel cats... so i wrote up a program that just
iterates over the file in 4k blocks and does nothing with the
data:
# time xargs -0 -n100 ~/tmp/reader < /tmp/filelist
0.300u 5.040s 0:37.07 14.4%     0+0k 0+0io 8735pf+0w
# time xargs -0 -n100 -P2 ~/tmp/reader < /tmp/filelist
0.320u 4.740s 1:35.30 5.3%      0+0k 0+0io 8735pf+0w
any ideas what is going on here?
i've seen the same thing on an smp system with 4x maxtors and software
raid5.

p.s.  i was trying to get more i/o in flight in hopes of seeing better
perf from the disk subsystem... i know it's hopeless with a single IDE
disk without TCQ, but i was targetting the 4-disk system.  are there
any newfangled fun interfaces which can improve the tree recursion and
zillion file open() bottlenecks in filesystem-level backups?
