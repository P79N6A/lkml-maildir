Yup, I think I like that plan.
One thing that may be interesting (I certainly think it migth be), would
be to add a "struct user_struct *" pointer to the vfs_cred as well. This
is because I'd just _love_ to have that "user_struct" fed down to the VFS
layer, since I think that is where we may some day want to put things like
user-supplied cryptographic keys etc.
The advantage of "struct user_struct" (as opposed to just a uid_t) is that 
it can have information that lives for the whole duration of a login, and 
it's really the only kind of data structure in the kernel that can track 
that kind of information.

Sounds fine to me.
