Just curious - is there something special about 42?  Grepping wasn't
very useful, as numbers like this are scattered all over the place.

Removing the first of two priv->outstanding_urbs increments in
visor_write (I assume that was your intention) produced very nice
results ;-)
1) When being flooded, after the initial bunch of URBs were sent,
only 1 per second was sent, and it appeared that all of them were
being freed.
2) Even after the flood, the driver survived, and backups were
possible after the device was reconnected.
I'm fairly ignorant of most of the lower level usb infrastructure
(hcd, hub, ehci, etc), so I'm not sure what the root cause (ignoring
the patch above) of the completion handler not being called might be.
I would suspect overflow of some callback list, but that's just a
guess.  Do you have any ideas on what this might be, and could this
be a problem in other devices?
