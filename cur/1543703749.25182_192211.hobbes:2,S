In the top Makefile look for the following lines:
DRIVERS-$(CONFIG_IDE) += drivers/ide/idedriver.o
DRIVERS-$(CONFIG_FC4) += drivers/fc4/fc4.a
DRIVERS-$(CONFIG_SCSI) += drivers/scsi/scsidrv.o 
These are taken from 2.4.23 patched with libata and iswraid.
You can move the line with SCSI before the one with
IDE (the rest does not matter) and recompile.
It worked for me, and i'm booting from 2 Seagate 80Gb
HDD's in RAID0 (so no modules allowed for SATA/SCSI/RAID).
