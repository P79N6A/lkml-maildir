Ok. It does smell like you marked somethign good that wasn't. That commit 
1db27c11 was the last one you claimed was bad, of course, so it's the one 
git will claim caused it, when you've marked its parent good.

Yeah, trying to do sysrq when it locks is probably worth it. As is 
enabling debugging things (netconsole, page-alloc, slab alloc, lockdep 
etc).
But if nothing seems to really give any clues, you might just try 
to restart bisection with
	git bisect reset
	git bisect start
	git bisect good v2.6.17
	git bisect bad 1db27c11
and just run the resulting kernel version for a day or two. If an hour 
wasn't really good enough, it's not as repeatable as we'd have wished, but 
even if it takes a few days to narrow it down by just two bisections or 
so, it will cut things down from ten thousand commits to "just" 2500..
