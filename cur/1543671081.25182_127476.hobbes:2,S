Sorry, I still don't get it.  Go through the steps for me:
1) suspend writes pages to disk
2) machine is shutdown
3) restart, journal replay
4) resume reads pages from disk.
Where did the corruption happen?
Please bear in mind that I don't really know how swsusp works, so tell it to
me in nice simple steps.
