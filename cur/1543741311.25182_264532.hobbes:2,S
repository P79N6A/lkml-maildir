Yes. I think that the problem I observed was when the ISR
wouldn't reset the interrupt because the hardware was broken.
This makes the level-interrupt stay active forever. I put
a printk() in the ISR and I got a bug-check because printk
didn't like me.
Apparently, if the printk() buffer gets full, it bug-checks.
The behavior used to be that it would just dump overflow
on the floor.
Cheers,
