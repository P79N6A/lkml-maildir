All 32-bit architectures have a 4GB address space, 64-bit architectures
obviously have a much bigger one (depends on the arch how many bits are
used for the address space).
PPC obviously does not have the dumb physical memory limitations x86
has, however.
Anyhow, Rik's mmap trick will work on any arch, not just x86.
