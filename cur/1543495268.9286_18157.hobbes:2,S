I've a via chipset with a 4Gb udma Maxtor and an asus 40x cdrom. The box
is killed each time i tried to mpeg a cd.
I've tried disabling udma on one or both drive but it's not enough.
After a week of try, i found that disabling udma and enabling
unmaskering interruptions on both drive was needed for a smooth use.
It seems that there is some problems with the gestion of dma channels.
Another bug that i've see on a P/120 is a conflict between the floppy
and the snd galaxy : when you play anything while accessing the floppy,
the box crashes. I've advised the guy to try builduing the drivers in
the core kernel instead of modules and I'am waiting for a answer.
I'will also try the new eide driver as it support my via chipset. I hope
it will solve all the problems.
