hi,
i'm new to linux kernel programming and i'm having the following problem:
When trying to use the sys_read and sys_write calls from within another
system call the return value is -14 (bad address EFAULT). This seems to be
happening because the 'access_ok' function is not allowing the access to
the buffer being used to read or write. 
Could someone explain why this is happening? Is it wrong to use
sys_read/sys_write through another system call?
thanks,
niloufer
