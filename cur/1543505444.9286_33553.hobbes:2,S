It certainly wont be moved, zorro like PCI is a bus and the code in
drivers/zorro is for handling the bus, just like drivers/pci and
drivers/dio.

Right now there is no rule, I personally dislike things likes
drivers/macintosh and drivers/acorn _very_ much. If you have a serial
or a SCSI driver they should go in drivers/scsi or drivers/char
respectively. Sticking things in private directories means most people
will ignore things in there when they start looking for code for a
certain chip and we end up with even more code duplication.
So if you have a new keyboard driver stick it in drivers/char like the
rest of them.
