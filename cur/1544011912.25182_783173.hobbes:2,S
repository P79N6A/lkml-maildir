A) this isn't a hot path, it's only when a file is renamed.
B) It's still a great idea (even if not here at least where I plan to
use an atomic_inc_return in my later fanotify patches).  Does anyone
know of an example of something like this in kernel?
Here I'm slightly concerned wasting enough bits of the 32 (we can't grow
it, because inotify has a fixed abi) for processors, but I'd be
surprised to find we'd ever have enough renames on a single processor
(my 2 second math would be we'd need about 13-14 bits for processors
which still leaves 262k renames per processor before anything wrapped)
to be a problem.
anyone who uses inotify think there would be a problem with cookie reuse
coming this soon?
Since I'm using a 64bit cookie and the lifetime of use in my later code
is measured in seconds I think this would be a great improvement.
Thanks
