Anyone know what's hard about kprobes on m68k? Roman?

Most of what makes dtrace better than SystemTap right now is the polish
of the userspace tools, the extra features (pre-userspace tracing,
post-mortem trace buffer extraction, speculative tracing, userspace
tracing, ABI stability notations, etc.), the better runtime library for
scripts, and the fact that they've found everything that can't be traced
without crashing the kernel and marked it untracable.
The D language itself may be quite limited (and hated because of that),
but it is clean and complete, which is something I can't say about
stap's language.
The existence of documentation really helps, too.
The actual probing mechanism itself is a very small part of what makes
dtrace good and SystemTap not there yet.

I should note that, despite being unneeded in a dynamic trace system, I
think the addition of static probe points is actually useful, and the
convenience they provide shouldn't be minimized. Obviously you're not
going to want to add static probe points for implementation-details that
are likely to change in the future (without noting that they're
implementation-specific and prone to change, anyway).
