It is b-tree based - a robust b-tree based read-write filesystem with
true Unix semantics is something which Linux could really use.  Even if
just for putting on read-only disks :-)  It is a 64-bit filesystem, and
they even state that its release is hoped to encourage the use of their
hardware - I don't think they're aiming for it to be usable on 32-bit
systems here.
I think their code, if acceptably licensed, may be very useful.  But I don't
think it should prevent us from supporting all other journalling and log-based
filesystems known to man, especially polycenter advfs support would be nice,
especially with dynamically resizable partitions and all the other magic
OSF/1 (now Digital Unix (now Compaq Tru64)) supports :-) and an especially for
Linux one too... there's no reason Linux should restrict itself to one of
anything, supporting choice in such areas is so much nicer.
David.
