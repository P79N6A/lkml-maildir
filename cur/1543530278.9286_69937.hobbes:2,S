This starts into some policy but the following is usually used:
1. System applications using shared text have their shared text charged to
   the system allocation.
   Shared system libraries are charged to the system.
   The data space is all charged to the user.
2. User applications using shared text have their shared text charged to
   a) the first user attached .... OR
   b) the owner of the text (unlikely) OR
   c) the charge is divided by the number of attached users and added to
      each attached user. If this eventually causes the last user to abort,
      then tough - that process gets aborted... OR
   d) ignore shared text, it cannot cause an OOM situation.
NOTE: All shared text gets faulted from the program image (I think). This
   is equivalent to expanding swap by the size of the program image. It
   should be very unlikely that shared text can put a user over the limit.
   Therefore it would seem that shared text of any type might be dropped
   from the equation for determining OOM contitions...
At least that is my reasoning... I recommend 2d for all shared text.
