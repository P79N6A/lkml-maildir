	It ought to be a pretty straightforward change to have the
bond_arp_send() function perform a neigh_lookup() prior to calling
arp_create(), and use the result of the lookup (if any) in the
arp_create() call.
	So, no, with the caveat that I haven't tried it, I don't see a
reason that bonding couldn't do what you're looking for.
