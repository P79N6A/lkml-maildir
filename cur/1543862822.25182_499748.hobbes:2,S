Many thanks for your detailed comments and suggestions.  It probably was
obvious that most of the things you picked up on were inherited from the
original Kwatch patch.  I'll update my patch in accordance with your
suggestions.
Responses to just a couple of the comments:

It would indeed be cleaner.  And in fact the local variant would have a
large amount of dead code, which could be left out entirely (at least from
the initial version).  That's because the only current user of local debug 
register allocations is ptrace.

It is called from two different places, and it's better than including
the "switch" in each place.

In the long run that may well be true.  For now, I'm a little hesitant to
put something which works only on i386 under include/linux.

It's easier to start out like this and then change it later when someone
comes up with another use for debugregs.  Or perhaps by then the whole
thing will have been moved over to utrace, making the issue academic.
