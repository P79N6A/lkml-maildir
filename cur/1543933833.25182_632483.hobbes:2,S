My question back to you is why are you doing this conversion?  Have you
found that it is needed for something?  Are there problems in the -rt
kernels that this conversion helps with?  Or is it just a janitorial
"convert semaphore to mutex" type thing.
If the latter, I would suggest dropping it, as this area is quite
complex and I think the locking chain too deep at times for a simple
conversion.
good luck,
