I don't understand what you're saying, sorry.
serial8250_init() registers an "ISA compatibility" 8250 device for those
architectures which haven't converted themselves to the new scheme.
It then creates all the 8250 ports from 0..UART_NR.  In the case of an
architecture which doesn't have any SERIAL_PORT_DFNS defined (eg, ARM)
these are just dummy placeholder registrations.
We then register the device driver, which allows us to pick up on the
platform devices.  This causes the placeholder registrations to be
reassigned to the platform devices on a first come first served basis
via the standard registration call serial8250_register_port().
While you can have both the "ISA compatibility" scheme and the
"platform device" scheme contain the same port description, you'll
only end up with just the one port registered in the end.  That just
happens to be correct and desired behaviour.
