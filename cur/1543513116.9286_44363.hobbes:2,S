Note that I wrote "_some_  --ignore-IP-conflict flag". 
It was  just a quicker way  to write "a  forceip flag that would  in essence
bring the  interface up, even if  we find out  that the IP is  already being
used by some other machine" :-)
I personally don't really care what the option is called anyway...
(For those who  missed the original discussion, the point  was that refusing
to bring the interface up by default would cause denial of service problems)
