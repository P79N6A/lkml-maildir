When using the 2.4.22-xfs kernel (Knoppix -> Debian installation), our
SATA root drive shows up as /dev/hdg, but under 2.6, it's now a SCSI
device, /dev/sda.  It took us a while to figure out what was wrong until
we finally got a serial line and were able to read the boot message
outputs.
This is the error message we got originally _before_ we appended
"root=/dev/sda3" to our command-line:
VFS: Cannot open root device "2203" or unknown-block(34,3)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
I have a feeling this will take a lot of SATA users by surprise, so
hopefully it'll be documented from now on.
