SuSE 6.2, kernel 2.2.14, Solaris 2.6 NFS server.
I just noticed, that lockd wasn't running, so locking was broken
anyway.

It is not clear how to turn on RPC debugging. Hints?
I can also start tcpdump but with a sufficiently good filter, because
this is not a reproduible thing, and I don't want to fill up my hard
