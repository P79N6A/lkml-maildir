Ahh you want to insert comments into the generated 
include/asm-*/asm-offsets.h. Hmmm, the header comments state that it was 
generated so one would hopefully look at the source file instead ?
If we want comments etc in there then we may want to do in some 
standardized fashion that works across all arches. Most of the 
arch/*/asm-offsets.c contents are exactly the same. Mips is deviating the 
most. If we could put some of the common stuff into common header files 
then this may turn out to be a nice code cleanup.
