Ok, I've downloaded the driver, and tried building as a modue to a
2.4.17-kernel. It segfaulted when I tried loading it (since it says it's not
done, I wasn't expecting it to work :).  However, my question is; how do you
guys develope network drivers, for instance?  I mean, in order to test a new
version (after the first has segfaulted), I need to reboot.  
I've got the broadcom-version dated 2th january 2002, and wanted to try and
implement small parts of missing code, mostly for educational purposes to
learn more about kernel programming.
