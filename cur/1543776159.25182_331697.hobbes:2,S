I now no longer suspect the ipw2200 module. It locks up within 5 minutes, 
reliably, with or without network load. I seem to always have to promote a 
large redraw in X11 before it occurs, but this is just hand waving, I don't 
really have any evidence.

It's a hard lockup, and I'll attempt to carry this out.

As usual Ingo, this is a thorough answer to my query and it explains exactly 
what I need to do. Fortunately this is an x86 laptop with a serial port, and 
I can easily find or make a cable to debug it over the serial console. I hope 
to have some useful information to you by the end of the day.
