I've been on vacation....
Nope, no snapshots.
Well, I couldn't get my orginal volume group visible under both
lvm 0.8 and 0.9.  I don't know why.  So I grabbed a big empty hard disk,
created a new volume group that was visible under both, dded all the logical
volumes over to it, updated fstab  and removed the offending vg.  I've yet to
recreate the original vg, copy stuff back and remove the new drive.
I should point out that the offending vg was relatively ancient, I think I
created it when 0.7 was king under some something like 2.2.14.  Now I'm 
running 2.4.0-ac4 and all works well.
