The second patch throws a decent-sized reject against Len's current tree. 
I was going to fix that but I note that the patches have serious whitespace
issues: multiple-spaces are used in many places where hard tabs should be
used.  Please fix all of that up.
Also, there's no overall description of what these patches *do*.  Just a
bunch of one-liners.  But what is the overall end-result?
