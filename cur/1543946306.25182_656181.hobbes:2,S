Subject: Improve init/Kconfig help descriptions [PATCH 0/9]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here is a series of 9 patches to init/Kconfig intended to improve the
usefulness and consistency of the help descriptions. The patches are
against linux-2.6.24.2.
Rationale:
Even though I've been using Unix for 20+ years, I find it sometimes
daunting to configure a linux kernel. The help descriptions supplied
sometimes help, and sometimes they do not.
The problems I can see with the supplied help descriptions fall into
these areas:
  - Uses arcane terminology which only kernel developers can understand
  - Inconsistently describes safe response (if unsure, ...)
  - References out-of-date external resources (404 error)
  - Description has not kept pace with recent kernel changes or standards
  - Poor grammar or layout.
My approach to improving the descriptions is to go through each option
checking the correctness of the description, validating any references
it makes, finding inconsistency with the rest of the kernel config,
and trying to improve the usefulness of the explanation. I want to
end up with:
  1 - Single sentence summary of what the option does
  2 - Explain terminology or situation if necessary and possible, linking
  to validated information sources (Documentation directory, manpages,
  scripts, URLs, Wikipedia)
  3 - Suggest safe answer for people who just don't know what to do.
The patches are in 9 parts because I wouldn't want to overwhelm any
reviewers, and also because I might have got some of them wrong. I
learned some cool things while researching these kernel options, like
what POSIX message queues are, and about the SLAB allocator, but my
grasp of cgroups and cpusets is tenuous at best. Here's a list of
the patches and the affected config options:
