Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get to it soon, sorry :)

Do we really care about this question?  I mean, if a user knows that
they want to use a specific module for their device (as they must know
this somehow), then they can just load the module today, and use the
dynamic id feature to add the new id.  At that time the device is bound
to the driver.
I don't really see this as a problem, but I might be missing something
obvious.

Not true.  The module will load just fine, just not bind to the device.
Well, old-style pci modules will not load, but I don't feel sorry about
them at all.  They have had about 3 years to convert to the "new" pci
api.
thanks,
