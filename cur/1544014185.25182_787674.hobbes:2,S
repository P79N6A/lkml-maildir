Nice - I like the use of list_replace_init.
In using local_irq_*, I was trying to avoid using priv->lock, which is
used by the rest of the driver to protect other data and hermes_* calls.
Since we have to use spinlock we should introduce an rx_lock
specifically to protect the list so the tasklet is not held up by
anything else the driver is doing. I'll put something together if you
don't get round to it first.

When I moved the RX handling into a tasklet I had a go at moving all the
interrupt handling code into the tasklet, and just couldn't get the card
to play nice. It might have worked if I disabled the interrupts (which I
didn't try), but my personal preference is not to touch interrupt
enables if we don't have to. Anyway, cons I can think of? :
* Ensuring the handler completes fast enough that we aren't late in
processing a 'more important' interrupt?
In the bug you've just seen, our tasklet failed to finish processing the
receive before the next receive. Where the whole interrupt is in a
tasklet with interrupts disabled, you rely on the firmware/hardware
buffering your RX data until you get around to it. If this situation
keeps happening it will run out of space. The current (RX)
implementation behaves better because we copy the data into an SKB ASAP,
ACK, and just leave the processing to later. We do rely on having
sufficient host memory.
* We'd have check the new implementation works on all the different cards.
The only thing of note left in the interrupt handler is processing scan
results, so overall I don't think it is worth spending time going down
this route.
