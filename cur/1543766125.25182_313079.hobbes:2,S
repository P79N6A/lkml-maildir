Ha!  That's the whole damn point Dave.  Use your head.  Just because ATI
is getting more complex with their GPU does *not* mean nVidia is.  Go
back to my original example of the aic7xxx cards.  The alternative to
their simple hardware design is something like the BusLogic or QLogic
cards that are far more complex.  Your assuming that because the ATI
cards are getting more complex and people are less able to discern their
makeup just by reading the specs that the nVidia cards are doing the
same, nVidia is telling you otherwise, and you are just blowing that off
as though you know more about their cards than they do.  Reality is that
they *could* be telling the truth and the fact that their card is a more
simplistic card than ATIs may be the very reason that ATI has ponied up
specs and they haven't.  Therefore, you can reliably discern absolutely
*zero* information about the nVidia cards from a reference to ATI specs.

"It's what you know, not what you think you know, that matters."  I
don't know why nVidia keeps their specs secret.  All I know is what they
tell the world.  But what I do know is that it's *possible* they could
be telling the truth, and I have no proof otherwise, regardless of any
suspicions.
