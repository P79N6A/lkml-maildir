Andries,
There are definitvely problems with disk change detection. Wether a
bunch of drives have a bug, or wether the bug is in the kernel I don't
know. 
Last time someone reported this, Alan and I both started shouting that
the change-detection on his drive must be broken. Until both of us ran
into it ourselves.....
