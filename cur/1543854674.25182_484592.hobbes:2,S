if API changes in the kernel break external modules that's not 
intentional, but a positive side effect reminding people that they 
should submit their modules for inclusion in mainline.

The rule is roughly:
If you change/remove a kernel API, you have to fix all in-kernel 
users.
As an example, the irqreturn_t change in 2.6.19 will require changes to 
your driver. It also broke at about 1000 in-kernel drivers, but all of 
them have been fixed as part of the change (the commit changed 1079 
different files).

Many people are still using kernel 2.4 for new kernel development 
because kernel 2.6 images are significantly bigger. Every unused byte 
removed from the kernel images makes this space regression smaller.

It's an integral part of the Linux development model that any kind of 
in-kernel API changes are always possible.
There's a choice between stable APIs on the one side and speed of 
development and smaller kernel images on the other side, and the Linux 
kernel prefers the latter.
