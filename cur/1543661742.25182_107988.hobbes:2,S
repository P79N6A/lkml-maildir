Cool (you're trying to fix it), maybe you can modify tcc so it is optimized 
for compiling linux (optimized for compiling speed and runtime speed for 
linux). I think it'll be easier and quicker to just make it compile linux 
properly first, then do the testing/fixing for other things, as they are so 
many compilers for other things anyway...And maybe it can be called "Linux C 
Compiler"? lol.
