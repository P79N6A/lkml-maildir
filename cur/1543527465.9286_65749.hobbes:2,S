Oh no, you misunderstand!  64 is PLENTY!  I'd never use that
many.  What I meant is that I don't want the number of VC's to be
restricted by the RAM size of the video hardware.  I don't care
if it is slower or not, just as long as it works.

I agree, which is why I'm not suggesting that anyone be forced to
use it.  If ANY change is made, I want the code to be a CONFIG
option, and *NOT* MANDATORY.  After that, if a user chooses to
use it, I want it to not be active until a userland app actually
enables it.  That way any user can decide on their own wether or
not they WANT the feature, and after that, how much memory THEY
are willing to give up to have the feature, and perhaps mark some
consoles as not having scrollback at all.
I for one would give up several megs of RAM for scrollback.  The
userland app that configures it could be reran to recall the RAM
when you don't need the scrollback again.
No user will complain that the thing is too big if they are the
ones who requested the feature to use that much memory in the
first place, especially when the default will be exactly what is
there now.
I don't want anyone to have a surprise feature thrown at them.

Exactly.  Which is why my proposal is to have a userland app
inform the kernel of the necessary modelines, fonts, clocks to
use.  Thus the kernel does not start out knowing about anything
more than it does now.  Your startup scripts run an app which is
something like SVGAtextmode which informs the kernel how to
change to the modes that will be used, and then tells the kernel
what mode each VC is supposed to be in.
Do you see anything I'm missing in the above?  I think it is
possible, but I'm not 100% sure.  I'd like other people's
feedback.
Again, I must stress that I'm not keen on bloating the kernel at
all.  I want minimal stuff in kernel to do the job, and I want
any changes to be made CONFIG_XXX options so that those that
absolutely don't want them can opt out, and have exactly what
they have now.
If that can't be done, then I don't want it in the main kernel
tree at all, but rather just in my own system.  I don't want any
features forced on everyone.

I realize all that...  It was just a cool idea... I don't know
how feasible it really is, and am not interested in trying to
code it up either right now.  If I ever do, it will be long after
the other stuff that I do really want.

Ok, can anyone tell me where to get the vgafb code?  If it does
what I'm looking for, I'd be glad to have something to start
with.

Is this really true?  Could I not have a userland interface which
a special app could tell the kernel these things at runtime?  If
it is impossible, I'd like to know why, or is it just really
complex?
I admit that I'm not that familiar with the code, so forgive me
if it is really complex an idea.

Hmm.  So a userland app would have to know what video card you
have.  This could be done with autodetection, or by the user
picking a card.  I don't see this a problem because you need to
do the same for X, or for any other OS out there anyways.  Once
the card is known by a userland app, it can inform the kernel of
this somehow no?  I mean not with what we have now, but we could
extend the kernel in this manner no?

Ok, then it does sound feasible.  The dotclock code can be stolen
from SVGATextMode, as long as it is GPL I guess.  At least it can
provide me with an idea of the details necessary.

My monitor is a new one.

Sorry, "anything" above is not true.  "Some things" "some
people" have suggested - is how it should read.

This sounds very much to me like what I want it to do indeed.

That sounds acceptible to me.  I don't want to just see numbers
and give up.  I want to see the working code (and I'm willing to
learn how to write it), and THEN if it sucks, ditch it.  I have a
feeling that it won't suck though - at least for me.

Allright, you've convinced me that vgafb is the way to go.  If it
can do what I want with some work, and nobody else is interested,
I'll work on it alone and extract braincells or info from you all
to aide me in my quest.
If I get it working, I most certainly will maintain it as long as
I am using it myself - which will likely be until the sun
implodes because I hate GUI stuff when text mode does the
job.  ;o)
Just point me to the vgafb code, and I'll have a look-see.  That
is from the 2.1.x era correct?
Thanks very much for your VERY useful information!  I've learned
a fair bit about this stuff now.
Take care!
