I am seeing messages such as:
Oct  9 12:52:51 smeagol kernel: Firewall:IN=ppp0 OUT= MAC=
SRC=64.152.2.36 DST=MY_IP_ADDRESS LEN=52 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=246
ID=1093 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=80 DPT=33157 WINDOW=34752 RES=0x00 ACK FIN
URGP=0
In my firewall logs.  I see them for ACK RST as well.  These are valid
connections.  My rules follow for the most part (a few allowed
connections to the machine in question have been removed from the
list).  This often leaves open connections in a half closed state on
machines behind this firewall.  It also some times kills totally open
connections and I see packets rejected that should be allowed through.
Please, help me help.  Also, please CC me.  The account I am subscribed
to the list with is acting up and I may be killing it.
