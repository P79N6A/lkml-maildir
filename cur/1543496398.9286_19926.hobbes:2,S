Hello.
I was using kernel verison 2.2.7 with no problems but I decided
to try out the new 2.2.9 kernel. When I booted the new kernel I
got an error message at boot time that I had not seen before.
Here is the output I was getting.
...
Adding Swap: 128484k swap-space (priority -1)
hdc: ATAPI 32X CD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.55
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: command error: error=0x51
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 64
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=16:00, iso_blknum=16, block=32
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
  Illegal mode for this track or incompatible medium -- (asc=0x64,
ascq=0x00)
My system still seems to work after finishing the boot so I am
not sure that this is really an error. If this is a problem with
the new 2.2.9 kernel then my hope is that this will help. If not
please ignore this post.
My system info:
AMD K6 366
8x CD ATAPI CDROM (with a disk in the drive)
Debian 2.1 system
thanks
