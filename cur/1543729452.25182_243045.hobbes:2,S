I don't think so. The main architecture dependent components are register
snapshotting and silencing of other cpus. These are not new problems to
solve as other projects such as LKCD, KDB have already done this for
most archs.

We should be able to re-use most of the code. The x86_64 port should be 
ready pretty quickly once kexec itself is available.
