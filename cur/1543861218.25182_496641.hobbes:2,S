It looks nice, and I'm giving it a spin: though hardly worth waiting
a week or so to see if it hits the old double-free (took 3.5 days of
load when I saw it before), since you've fairly clearly rearranged
that out of existence - any bugs will be new ones all your own ;)
And I don't really have any NUMA anyway, just build that way ever
since testing some mempolicy change.  So don't pay much attention to
my results, though of course I'll let you know if I see it go wrong.
The main thing is to make sure that your patch doesn't end up applied
to a tree with my patch in, since that would then be a (rare) leak.
