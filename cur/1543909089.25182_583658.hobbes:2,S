It was solved, by not throttling writeout that comes from shrink_caches.

The problem is that sk_alloc (called from our block driver via 
socket->write) would recurse into shrink_pages, which recursively 
submits IO to our block driver and blocks on the throttle.  Subtle 
indeed, and yet another demonstration of why vm recursion is a Bad 
Thing.
I will find a traceback for you tomorrow, which makes this deadlock much 
clearer.
