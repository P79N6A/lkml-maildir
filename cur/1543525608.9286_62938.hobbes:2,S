There is an elegant way to solve this problem: do a hash over the plain
text data without the first block and use that as the IV. Then do CFB.
On decryption you decrypt everything but the first block and calculate
the hash, then use the hash to get the first block (this is from
Peter Gutmann's SFS). Cost are a few more cycles.

I consider the absolute blocks broken too. The problem is just that
loop has no sanity checks at all (no format version number, no way to
check the password in advance). I think such an arbitary change is 
not manageable.

Absolute block numbers are not for the paranoid (they are much better
with the hash technique above), but for compatibility.
