Really?  If you don't have all the hwmon drivers built in, then I'm not
sure how the i2c subsystem could take so long to init.  Can we see the
entire kernel config please?

That message comes from the (optional) Linux i2c ioctl interface.  It is not
the whole core.

Actually, it can't do that.  The i2c core doesn't know anything about
"done probing".  It probes whenever a new master or slave driver is
registered, which could happen at any time.

Why don't you just use the sensors-detect script from the lm-sensors project
to see what hardware you have?  If you don't have a kernel with all of the
i2c-bus drivers built as modules, you could probably just boot knoppix and
run the script from there.

That particular message is displayed by accident; it's a bug.  Jean already
ack'ed that.
