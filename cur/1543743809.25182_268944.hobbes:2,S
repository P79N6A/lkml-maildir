Looks like we have success, I recompiled the kernel with the following options
turned on:
Video mode selection support: y
Select compiled-in fonts:
  VGA 8x16 font: y
Then I added this line to my grub.conf file:
  video=aty128fb:1028x768 vga=792
Not sure if the vga part makes any difference, my educated guess is that it
doesn't. But this setup will allow for a console that is 129x47 lines. (yay!)
Thanks for the help.
