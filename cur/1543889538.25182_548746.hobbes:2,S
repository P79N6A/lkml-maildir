Again, why?  Why don't we trust the compiler to decide if a function
should be inlined or not, even if the definition happens to be in a .h
file?
It seems like a perfectly valid optimization for the compiler to only
emit code once for a function and then call it where it is used, even
if that function happens to be defined in a .h file.
