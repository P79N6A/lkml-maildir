It's a bit of both.  The parport_lowlevel alias shouldn't really be used
any more, and instead the following line in modules.conf ought to take its
place:
post-install parport /sbin/modprobe -k parport_pc
(adjust for your architecture).  In 2.4, though, the intention is that the
alias will still work but will trigger a warning message.
Something like this patch should probably be applied (it's untested):
