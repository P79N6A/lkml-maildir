Run memtest86 to see what your memory bandwidth is.
You can also compare a tight loop ala bogomips with dirtying about as many 
pages as you have cache (memtest86 can find this), with dirtying more pages 
than you have cache in a big evil loop.
If this shows that your problem ISN'T memory bandwidth, then you'll have 
learned something.

All the celerons I know about have a 66 mhz front side bus speed.  (Actually 
there was a notebook version with a 100mhz fsb, but no desktop ones I know 
of.)  It's a totally artificial limitation to get you to buy a real Pentium 
III.  Intel crippling its low-end to avoid hurting the high end.  (They let 
AMD do that for them. :)
I've got links bookmarked about this somewhere.  You can probably find it on 
Tom's Hardware, or check google...

Yup.  Blame Intel's marketing department.  This isn't a SIS problem, that's 
pure Intel's crippling of the DeCeleron...
