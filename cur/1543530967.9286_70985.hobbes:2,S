My recollection is you get an "infinite" stack, demand allocated.
Exactly the same you get via malloc() - an unpopulated address space,
which is then populated when you use it.
Very handy in quite a few situations; no need to predefine your stack
size (as you would have to without overcommit), no need to mess around
trapping exceptions (as you do to implement sparse matrixes on
Win32)...
James.
