MMX2 does not cause any problems for me.  Robert (the guy who wrote these) has 
provided me with two more versions that mimic the Athlon optimized 
fast_page_copy and fast_page_clear functions in mmx.c.  They aren't exact 
copies, but are close.  One fails for me consistently, the other does not.  The 
one that fails consistently is the one that mimics the fast_page_copy code.  I'm 
still trying to provide him more datapoints about the failures to see if we can 
uncover anything.
