Doesn't actually fix the problem. Well *sigh*, it does but it doesn't
if you know what I mean. It "fixed" the problem because your other
(non-empty) zones will now increase total_scanned, which means the busy
loop will turn into a sleepy loop and you don't notice a problem.

Apart from the above, akpm's patch does fix *a* bug, but actually changes
much more common case code a lot more than my patch, and has less obvious
consequences. It really wants a full cycle for performance regressions to
appear.
