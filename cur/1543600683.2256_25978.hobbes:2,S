That buffers count looks like you have something leaking. Probably a file
system. When kswapd is busy like that it is trying to free buffer cache.
The lack of freeing implies something is still holding those buffer cache
entries in memory.

Thats good, Linus tree currently lasts about 30 minutes for me. I'd be
interested to know what your workload is and what drivers/filesystem you
are using so I can look for leaks.
