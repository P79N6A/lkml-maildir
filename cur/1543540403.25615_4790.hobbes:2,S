That is the problem. Linus has been saying that for years, but
as I said, for some reason people refuse to listen. You're proving
my point.

Read <8lop07$2ee$1@penguin.transmeta.com> in which Linus says:
  >/usr/include/asm is a symlink to /usr/src/linux/include/asm, as in the

  I've asked glibc maintainers to stop the symlink insanity for the last
  few years now, but it doesn't seem to happen.
  
  Basically, that symlink should not be a symlink.  It's a symlink for
  historical reasons, none of them very good any more (and haven't been
  for a long time), and it's a disaster unless you want to be a C library
  developer.  Which not very many people want to be. 
  
  The fact is, that the header files should match the library you link
  against, not the kernel you run on.
