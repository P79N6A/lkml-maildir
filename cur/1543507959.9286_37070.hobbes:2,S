No. I read the 0.9 spec. I thought "oh dear". I read the 1.0 spec and thought
"oh well"

Linux doesnt permit memory allocation in a block I/O handler. Linux
supports blocking memory allocations all sorts of places which UDI can't
express.

Read it again. It tells you that the old PCI methods still work.

The kernel source is the reference.

drivers/char/synclink.c is the only character driver making major use of
PCI bus mastering in simple ways (the video capture stuff tends to write
scripts for video engines so its less than intuitive). The network
drivers are a much easier read for that. Basically its
	buf=kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
	if(buf==NULL)
		sulk();
	
	phys_addr = virt_to_bus(buf);
	write_buffer_out();
	mb();	/* stop the compiler from any sneaky saves in registers */
	poke_hardware(phys_addr);
Then whenever you are told the buffer is done continue with it.
The only horrible case to watch is terminating a live DMA. PCI does write
posting so doing
	writel(STOP_DMA, card->control);
	kfree(buf);
is fatal every so often, as the write will be posted, the buffer freed,
reallocated and trashed before the DMA is posted. Instead use
	writel(STOP_DMA, card->control);
	readl(card->anythingboring);
	kfree(buf);
