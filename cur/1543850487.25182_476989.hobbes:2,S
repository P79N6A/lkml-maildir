Yeah, let's get more of the commonly used omap drivers merged!

Core omap stuff goes first to linux-omap tree, and then gets merged
to mainline kernel through RMK. Drivers should go through the
appropriate driver maintainers or LKML.
So please split your patches accordingly. All arch/arm/*omap* and
include/asm-arm/arch-omap patches should be separate from drivers.
Regards,
Tony
