Thanks, that's what I've been looking for...
 From the documentation:
The main problem up to this date (November 2004) is that linux kernel 
has only one behaviour regarding multiple keyboards : any key pressed 
catched on any keyboard is redirected to the one and only active Virtual 
Terminal (VT).
Will this be changed/improved when the console code is moved into 
userspace, like some have proposed?
