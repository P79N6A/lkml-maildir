I've recieved this warning in the past several ac versions both 2.4.5
and 2.4.4. Here is the out put from the compiler:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i586   -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
In file included from /usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/raid/md.h:50,
                 from init/main.c:24:
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/raid/md_k.h: In function
`pers_to_level':
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/raid/md_k.h:41: warning: control
reaches end of non-void function
Also the file /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc seems to be missing on my
machine. How would I remedy this problem?
Could you CC all responces to me because my router does not support ECN.
Thank you,
Sean Jones
