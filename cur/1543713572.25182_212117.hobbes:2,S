You passed the structs by value: you wanted to pass the address.
Linus dislikes typedefs for various reasons: if it's actually a struct
on some archs and not on others, he likes it.  Otherwise he historically
prefers the struct.  However, Linus is not the most reliable barometer.
Ingo added task_t because it make some lines fit in the sched.c code,
for example.  We removed list_t in 2.5.34.
I dislike typedefs because you have an extra name for something, and can
predeclare structs, which saves gratuitous header file inclusion.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
