    [XFS] Put the correct offset in dirent d_off
    
    The recent filldir regression fix was not putting the correct d_off in
    each dirent. This was resulting in incorrect cookies being passed to dmapi
    ioctls and the wrong offset appearing in the dirents. readdir was
    unaffected as the filp->f_pos was being updated with the correct offset
    and this was being written into the last dirent in each buffer. Fix the
    XFS code to do the right thing.

    [XFS] Don't wait for pending I/Os when purging blocks beyond eof.
    
    On last close of a file we purge blocks beyond eof. The same code is used
    when we truncate the file size down. In this case we need to wait for any
    pending I/Os for dirty pages beyond the new eof. For the last close case
    we are not changing the file size and therefore do not need to wait for
    any I/Os to complete. This fixes a performance bottleneck where writes
    into the page cache and cache flushes can become mutually exclusive.
