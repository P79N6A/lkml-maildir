A real problem is that the HCD core seems to have the assumption
built-in that there can only be one OHCI driver per machine/arch.
That's not the case for SSB, where we can have both PCI and SSB
bus enabled, so both ohci drivers compiled.
Any idea? Greg perhaps?
Refactoring the code that OHCI drivers register to the HCD core
instead of hard-linking it in would fix the issue. But that's pretty
intrusive to do.
