In some ways that is NOT trivial, given that a high-level
language is free to use N:M threading.
If we assume that isn't allowed though, blaming the library
for not using native Linux thread IDs is entirely reasonable.
Linus picked sane ID numbering, not Solaris-style. Normal
app developers are unable to take advantage of Linus'
wise decision.

We were sort of settling on "struct signal" as the process.

Yes, in a way. Adding stuff is usually easier than removing
stuff. I couldn't decide between /proc/self/task/self and /proc/task,
so I left the decision for later. I wasn't sure that I'd thought of
all the issues.

Most of user-space is worse.
What shocks me is that people keep designing ABIs with structs
that contain holes. (data leaks, waste, portability trouble, etc.)
This happens in kernel ABIs all the time. It ought to be blocked
by some sort of build tool. (with a whitelist for old stuff)
Another shocker is /proc/*/smaps, which should make you cry.
At the time I was working too much overtime to post about it,
and I figured that nobody would allow that into the kernel anyway...
Speaking of which, that's one that has no need to be in the task
directories. I put a maps file there to make porting old code easier,
but neither one really belongs. It's per-mm, which was in a 1:n
relationship with struct signal last I checked.
