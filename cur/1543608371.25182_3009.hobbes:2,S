I noticed that my last kernel was not behaving correctly.  Specifically
that nfs (unrelated) and devfs were not starting correctly.  I upgraded
to the 2.4.13 kernel and paid special attention to those two items.  Now
syncing with Coldsync no longer causes a kernel panic.  It just doesn't
work.  It can't communicate with the Clie to get the serial number and
other information.  Since I'm using devfs I can't say it is the kernel. 
I will have to test it further.
