  Other than a few things reporting wrong numbers, what costs do you
anticipate? I have servers in six USA states (four timezones) and I
haven't seen any real ill-effect on this.
  Back in the Xenix days we had servers on three continents and they were
doing critical applications. There were serious costs there, people did
have to be on site for a reboot.
