Talking about confusing: Some people (rightly, I think) feel that
within a stable release, you shouldn't be required to upgrade userland
tools. A system installed with 2.2.0 should be seamlessly upgradeable
to 2.2.12. Everyone knows that when you go from 2.0.x to 2.2.x, you
might (and as it happens, WILL) have to upgrade a few userland
packages, but within a stable kernel release, an upgrade shouldn't
lead to an avalange of user-space-program upgrades.
As I understand things, the RAID code works for some who hate to have
to upgrade their tools "for nothing", but not for others, who hate to
have to keep on patching their kernel.
