Alan,
I believe that I have in the major/high points of the issue.
The principle goal of the design is to get venders to rethink their
threshold on the IP of hardware.  It is a way to let them get their feet
wet during the transition period to eventual OpenSource.
We all agree that some folks will only be bench warmers (me being a former),
with time to ponder these issues while starring off on to space.
(I was a professional astronomer, until Aug 9th, thus "starring")
All we need to do is update "Rubini's" work and allow the vendors to come
to us.......I know that O'Reily asked you to do a suppliment, and one
tried to get me to volunteer also............
Understand that I require minimal exposure to the kernel to adopt the
the current "fops" or a version that will fit the model.
