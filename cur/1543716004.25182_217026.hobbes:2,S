Found the lock. Unfortunately, its not exported, so a device driver can't use
it without changing that. Additionally, its a spinlock, and it takes 2 seconds
to complete BIST, which seems a bit too long to hold a spinlock.

The ipr driver, a scsi device driver for ppc64.

The driver runs BIST at device initialization time to ensure that the device
is in a clean state. It will also run BIST on module unload, and in various
error scenarios.
