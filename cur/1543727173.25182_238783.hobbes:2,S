Using procps version 2.0.7 the inclusion of "e" in the arguments is documented to
return environment of the process.
So the below issues with "ps eaxf" are only surprising in that you claim the pipe is
necessary to see the environment.  Ps has "always" done slightly different things
when used at the head of a pipe.  In particular it will trim it's right side when not
in a pipe to keep the display readable, while in a pipe the lines will be "as long as
necessary."
The question of why the original poster was getting the environment when only using
"ps ax" is interesting.  I'd look for PS_PERSONALITY (etc) in the ps-executing
environment.  [consult your manual.]
And so on...
Rob.

When piped. For instance
   ps eaxf
does not, while
   ps eaxf | cat
does, at least on my systems. I tried on RHEL AS3.0 thru a four year old 
version of Slackware, all did the same thing.
