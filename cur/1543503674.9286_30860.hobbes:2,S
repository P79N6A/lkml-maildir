It is called a ramdisk.  I believe there is a howto.  I can't see
how in todays technology age that ANY ramdisk speeds up ANY
system for ANY reason though.  The memory is better used as
cache, etc...  Forcing it to ramdisk needlessly wastes the unused
space IMHO.
I've yet to see anyone provide useful benchmark results that show
benefits of running ramdisks.
