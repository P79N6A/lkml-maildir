Ok, I guess I didn't make myself as clear as I thought.
What I meant was that if 4K stacks are always enabled by default, then
you'll get more testing than if only people who enable DEBUG_KERNEL
are able to turn it on.
So I guess what I'm really aiming at is to either move the option up a
level - that is, remove its dependency on CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL, or turn
the option on its head and make it an option to enable 8K stacks
instead and make that option then default to N (I like the first
aproach better though).
Something like this :

          If you say Y here the kernel will use a 4Kb stacksize for the
          kernel stack attached to each process/thread. This facilitates
