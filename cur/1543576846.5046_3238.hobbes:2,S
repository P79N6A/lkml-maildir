It doesn't work out of the box starting from pre3 because there are a
few fields in the task struct implemented this way:
	struct list_head local_pages; int allocation_order, nr_local_pages;
that is perfectly valid C code but I wasn't aware of the check_asm.sh sed
script assumptions and so I incidentally broke sparc's `make check_asm', sorry.
To make my 2.2.x tree to work on sparc64 I temporarly broken the above line in
two for the time of `make check_asm'. I guess we can go with this patch for
2.2.x instead of doing the right fix ;)
