Disabling the BAR decoding does not mean disabling the device (aside 
from the one  group of host bridge that apparently disables CPU to RAM 
access, whose designers were apparently on crack when they read the PCI 
spec and which is why we don't disable the decode on host bridges). 
There really is no other sane way to do it.
If we do encounter other devices that choke on having the BAR disabled 
during probing then we can add additional quirk logic, but we haven't 
run into anything like that yet.
