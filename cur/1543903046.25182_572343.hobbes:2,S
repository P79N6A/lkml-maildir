Subject: [PATCH 6/6] basic support of interleaved reads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a simplified version of the pagecache context based readahead.
It handles the case of multiple threads reading on the same fd and invalidating
each others' readahead state. It does the trick by scanning the pagecache and
recovering the current read stream's readahead status.
The algorithm works in a opportunistic way, in that it do not try to detect
interleaved reads _actively_, which requires a probe into the page cache(which
means a little more overheads for random reads). It only tries to handle a
previously started sequential readahead whose state was overwritten by
another concurrent stream, and it can do this job pretty well.
Negative and positive examples(or what you can expect from it):
1) it cannot detect and serve perfect request-by-request interleaved reads
   right:
	time	stream 1  stream 2
	0 	1         
	1 	          1001
	2 	2
	3 	          1002
	4 	3
	5 	          1003
	6 	4
	7 	          1004
	8 	5
	9	          1005
Here no single readahead will be carried out.
2) However, if it's two concurrent reads by two threads, the chance of the
   initial sequential readahead be started is huge. Once the first sequential
   readahead is started for a stream, this patch will ensure that the readahead
   window continues to rampup and won't be disturbed by other streams.
	time	stream 1  stream 2
	0 	1         
	1 	2
	2 	          1001
	3 	3
	4 	          1002
	5 	          1003
	6 	4
	7 	5
	8 	          1004
	9 	6
	10	          1005
	11	7
	12	          1006
	13	          1007
Here steam 1 will start a readahead at page 2, and stream 2 will start its
first readahead at page 1003. From then on the two streams will be served right.
