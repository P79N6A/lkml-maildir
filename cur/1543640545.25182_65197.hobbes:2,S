Where do the Qdisc.stats show up? in /proc? (Assuming CONFIG_NET_SCHED is
not defined) I can see that it is copied to the skb from 
qdisc_copy_stats with 'TCA_STATS' attribute, but where is it being 
reported? or what is it being used for ?? Specifically, does 
Qdisc.stats.drops get reported anywere?
While I am at it, I see that qdisc->enqueue routines kfree the skb with the
dev->queue_lock held (when the enqueue routine drops the packet -- 
NET_XMIT_DROP)  from dev_queue_xmit. kfree_skb can be done outside the 
lock.... right? I can make a patch for this if I am not missing something.....
TIA
Kiran
