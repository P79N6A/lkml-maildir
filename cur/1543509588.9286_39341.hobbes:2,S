Yes, 'stable' kernels aren't perhaps always as stable as they might be, but
this seems to be pretty rare.
The big plus point is that you have the source kicking around. So if you decide
that 1.2.x was your ideal kernel, and you don't want any of the features that
later versions add, you can continue to maintain it, backport drivers, fix
bugs, etc.
