It is, but no one has asked for it to be changed to be like the struct
device attributes are.  In fact, why not just use the struct device
attributes here instead?  That will be much easier and keep me from
having to convert your code over to use it in the future :)

Ick, no.  You should use the hwmon interface, and standardize on a
proper battery api just like those developers have standardized on other
sensor apis that are exported to userspace.  Take a look at
Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface for an example of what it should
look like.

Yes, I agree this should be done in this manner.

That sounds good to me.
Jean, I know you had some ideas with regards to this in the past.
