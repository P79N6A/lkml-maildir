The bootp-server uses raw sockets, iptables can't (and shouldn't) block
that. By the time iptables gets the packet, the bootp-server already got
a copy of the packet.
The bootp-server uses raw sockets in order to among other things be able
to send replies to a specific macaddress.
linux-kernel isn't the correct list for this. Please look at
