nit picks:
   * you added/changed options without updated Documentation/filesystems/9p.txt
   * you changed v9fs->extended to be part of a flags structure, that
should have been
       a separate patch
   * rename of options should have been done in a separate patch

Even small cleanups like this should probably be confined to a
separate patch if they are unrelated.

The way the patch got formatted, these look like compulsive
renames..but there's an added function and then changes to the other
two.  I think it might be because of the way you ordered the
functions.  Put new functions after the old functions and maybe this
won't happen.  And clone seems to have lost his function header.  The
code is pretty inconsistent about those these days, but I'd like to do
an audit soon and make sure we have proper comment blocks where
appropriate.

Please fix up these small bits and resubmit.

Also, go ahead and cc: me directly on patches, for some reason this
one missed my normal filters and got lost.  If I'm directly cc:'d it
will pop to the top of my inbox.
