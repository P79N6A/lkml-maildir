   I think there may be a bit of confusion here.  The PC-style ports
   already exist, and Linux already handles them.  If I build a modular
   kernel (which I do), the current version of Linux will already do the
   fbm needed to load the drivers and give me access.   If I use a
   devfs, current 2.3.x's will do the fbm needed to load the drivers and
   give me access without any changes to userland.  But if I use devd as
   described in recent email on the kernel list, I either have to have
   the device nodes already installed or I have to bloat my kernel with
   the detection parts of the drivers or I have to build the drivers
   into the kernel.
