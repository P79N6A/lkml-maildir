You and Larry are either talking past each other, or perhaps it is I who
don't understand the not-yet-existing CC-clusters.  My understanding is
that communication between nodes of a CC-cluster would be through a
shared-memory mechanism, not through much slower I/O such as a network
(even a very fast network).

hold in the current architecture. Primarily, by having nodes so close
together, physical network latencies and problems disappear."

My point is this: Currently at least one vendor (SGI) wants to scale the
kernel to 128 CPUs.  As far as I know, the SGI Altix systems can be
configured up to 512 CPUs.  If the Intel Tanglewood really will have 16
cores per chip, very much larger systems will be possible.  Will you be
able to scale the kernel to 2048 CPUs and beyond?  This may happen
during the lifetime of 2.8.x, so planning should be happening either now
or soon.
