Basically IDE-SCSI is a work-around to allow userspace programs that
were designed to talk to SCSI devices to use SCSI-like devices
connected to an IDE bus.
This works, but obviously it is better to support things natively.
IDE CD recorders are probably the most popular SCSI-like IDE device
and were therefore quickly supported.  Less common hardware, such as
some IDE MO drives, continues to require IDE-SCSI for the time being.

It's easy enough to write something in userspace to identify which
devices are which and create devices such as /dev/cdrom
automatically - no need to use IDE-SCSI for that.
