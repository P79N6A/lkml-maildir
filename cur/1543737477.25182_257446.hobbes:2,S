 the resuming.

 Frequently Asked Questions
 ==========================
 
@@ -123,27 +112,13 @@
 
 Q: Does linux support ACPI S4?
 
-A: No.
-
-When swsusp was created, ACPI was not too widespread, so we tried to
-avoid using ACPI-specific stuff. ACPI also is/was notoriously
-buggy. These days swsusp works on APM-only i386 machines and even
-without any power managment at all. Some versions also work on PPC.
-
-That means that machine does not enter S4 on suspend-to-disk, but
-simply enters S5. That has few advantages, you can for example boot
-windows on next boot, and return to your Linux session later. You
-could even have few different Linuxes on your box (not sharing any
-partitions), and switch between them.
-
-It also has disadvantages. On HP nx5000, if you unplug power cord
-while machine is suspended-to-disk, Linux will fail to notice that.
+A: Yes. That's what echo platform > /sys/power/disk does.
 
 Q: My machine doesn't work with ACPI. How can I use swsusp than ?
 
 A: Do a reboot() syscall with right parameters. Warning: glibc gets in
 its way, so check with strace:
