cpu_relax() is a really good idea in every spinloop on
hyper-threaded cores.  It lets the h/w know that we aren't
doing anything useful here, so resources and power can be
diverted to other threads sharing the core.
Avoiding the need for volatile or other compiler optimizer
defeating tricks is a side benefit.
