Hi, 
I came across this bug hacking on sparc32. If fork fails in copy_mm ->
dup_mmap, destroy_context is called on the new mm before
init_new_context. 
fork.c:330 
	retval = -ENOMEM; 
	mm = allocate_mm(); 
	if (!mm) 
		goto fail_nomem; 
	/* Copy the current MM stuff.. */ 
	memcpy(mm, oldmm, sizeof(*mm)); 
	if (!mm_init(mm)) 
		goto fail_nomem; 
Failure is ok here. We don't try to do an mmput, but we have memcpy'd
the mm struct context and all. 
	down_write(&oldmm->mmap_sem); 
	retval = dup_mmap(mm); 
	up_write(&oldmm->mmap_sem); 
	if (retval) 
		goto free_pt; 
If we fail and call mmput, destroy_context gets called before
init_new_context below. This removes the parent process's context since
it was just memcpy'd from the parent's mm struct. 
	/* 
	 * child gets a private LDT (if there was an LDT in the parent) 
	 */ 
	copy_segments(tsk, mm); 
	if (init_new_context(tsk,mm)) 
		goto free_pt; 
Can we move the init_new_context to just after the mm_init call? Works
nicely on sparc. Most archs have a fairly trivial init_new_context
anyway.
