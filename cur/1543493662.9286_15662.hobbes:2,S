I have had the same error with both 2.2.5 and 2.2.6. It seemed to appear
only after I did a 'make mrproper'. I have done several things trying to
fix this, such as downloading and compiling the latest ncurses and
installing various RPMs. However, the problem seemed to go away if I did
a 'make dep' before 'make menuconfig'. I'm not sure if this is actually
what did it or something else in my tinkering, but you might as well
give it a shot.
