I would like to see all of the /proc/mounts and friends info that
"knows" about the legacy name, to disappear if possible.  Yes, I know
the root filesystem logic will have to stay, but I don't want to see
this be used like the devfs name is used throughout the kernel.  That
info should not be in the kernel, it's up to the user what to name their
"USB mouse, connected to the EHCI host controller's 3 hub port".

Yes, this info is needed, and if presented in a file, that would be
fine.  It was just that the device node was a nice compact version of
this :)
But I can see how the device node would be abused, and it's fine with me
if it isn't present in driverfs.
thanks,
