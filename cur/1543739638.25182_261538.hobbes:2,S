lets skip these for the time being, large runtime ones are the first 
ones to be squashed.

interesting - this could be a printk (trace) done in a critical section
though. What does /proc/latency_trace tell, is it full of console code
functions?
one of the best ways to avoid the console-printk-ing overhead is to do a
'dmesg -n 1' and reset the maximum back to 50. (i prefer to use the
preempt_max_latency option not the preempt_thresh option.)

this setup shouldnt produce above-100 usec latencies with -U5 and
PREEMPT_REALTIME.
