I sent a similar patch to the list earlier this week, which also fixed
up the braindamaged indentation that Lindent recently did to the file.
I missed some of the ones you had though, and it seems, you also

+   { set_max_cstate, "IBM ThinkPad R40e", {
+    DMI_MATCH(DMI_BIOS_VENDOR,"IBM"),
+    DMI_MATCH(DMI_BIOS_VERSION,"1SET68WW") },
+    (void*)1},
