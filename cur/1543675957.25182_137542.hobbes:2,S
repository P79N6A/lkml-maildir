I've got quite a few active bug reports in my bug database, which are not attached to any confirmed bugs:

http://grabjohn.com/kernelbugdatabase/index.php?action=21&id=19&session=
If anybody can confirm that these are reproducable, not reproducable, or that fixes have gone in to any particular kernel, please let me know, or update the database yourself.
By the way, some more feedback on this bug database would be appreciated - do people like it, hate it, not care, or what?  There is no need to create an account to use it anymore, by the way, and there hasn't been for a few months now - you can just use the links at the top to navigate through it regardless of whether you're logged in or not.
John.
