You should not be allocating requests from that path, for a number of
reasons. The design isn't very nice either.
The easy way out would be to punt to a workqueue to handle the requests.
An alternative way would be to set aside some requests that you can get
at without allocation (maintain a little freelist of manually allocated
requests), and retrieve a free one from there when inside request_fn. If
you run out, just bail out of request_fn and make sure to reinvoke it
when some of your previously issued requests complete and are added back
to that freelist.
