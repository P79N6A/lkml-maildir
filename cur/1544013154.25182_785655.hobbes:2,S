Roland -
Your suggestion was the key that solved my problem.
In short, the problem does not appear to be in the openSUSE 11.1
release, but instead in the version of bios I happened to have on
my D945GCLF2 board.  Upgrading from bios version 0099 to 0122
allowed me to do a totally trouble-free upgrade from 11.0 to 11.1 (64 bit).
I have added a closing note to the forum article.
So, thank you (and you also, Jesper) for your helpful suggestions
and have a very Happy New Year!
Sincerely,
John Dierks
