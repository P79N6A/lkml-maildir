And any other filter modules which use the open loadable block
converter interface in the loop device. That kerneli exists as a patch is 
IMHO just an historical accident, near all of it can be done fine without 
ever touching any linux source at all.  Please take a small peek out of
your small world ;) 
BTW, kerneli would also not handle the case of switching block sizes anyways,
with relative IVs or not, because it does not restart its CFB chain inside
the device blocks every 512 byte blocks with a new IV. When you switch 
from a bigger block size to a smaller you would need backwards peeking to 
earlier blocks (and know the block size anyways). Similar problem for 
going to bigger blocks. Ingo's change makes it a bit less painless, but
still not trivial to handle.
