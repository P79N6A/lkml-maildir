I agree with you that one can think and propose an improved kernel
logging system, but that might be an incremental effort. For now,
patches like the ones you or I sent are a step in the general direction
of improving kernel logging, fix an inconsistency and  increase the
probability of people logging kernel message as intended (i.e. at a
minimum, with a loglevel). I don't think that this hurts or delays the
perceived urgency of getting a sub-optimal kernel logging mechanism...

I'm not sure way must it be later or why the resistance about a little
better and sooner.
Cheerios,
Emil.
