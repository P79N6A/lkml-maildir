I've seen the following error when booting a dell 2550 (dual p3, serverworks  
CNB20HE chipset):
APIC error on CPU0: 08(08)
(repeats until i hard reset the machine)
I've seen this for every combination of 2.4.19-rc/ac patch that i've tried,
however the 2.4.19-rc kernels work fine (my test system is currently running
2.4.19-rc3). I'd like to help resolve this issue, but I'm not quite sure as to
where to start save rolling back all of the apic deltas in the -ac patch
series.
