I have a feeling that this isn't stressing the disks properly, since the
drive light isn't glowing, but only flashes every now and then...
A simple read (ie 'find -type f') isn't good enough, I need to WRITE

I still get that problem with the aborting command just after it found
the partitions, but after that the driver/kernel is silent...
