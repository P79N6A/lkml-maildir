 Hmmm, I didn't know about the possibility to disable interrupts.
 In the OOPS thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=113269682409774&w=2
 *IIUC*, Greg told us that we could think about the possibility to drop
the spin lock and use the semaphore instead, because URB writes are slow.
 We (me and Eduardo) didn't like it because we would be using the same
lock for two different problems, so we suggested the atomic_t, and Greg
agreed (IIRC).
 Isn't it right? Is the URB write so fast that switching to atomic_t
doesn't pay-off?
