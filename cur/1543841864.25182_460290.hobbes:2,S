Direct modification of branches is similar to direct modification of
block devices underneith a mounted filesystem.  While I agree that
such a thing _should_ not oops the kernel, I'd bet that you can easily
run a stresstest on a filesystem while randomly flipping bits in the
block device and get just that.
There are bigger problems in unionfs to worry about.
