bootmem is a limited boot-time only thing, eg. it does not work from
modules. Nor is it generic enough to be eg. highmem-capable. It's not
really a fully capable allocator, i wrote bootmem.c rather as a simple
bootstap allocator, to be used to initialize the real allocator cleanly,
and to be used in some criticial subsystems that initialize before the
main allocator.
bigphysarea is a separate allocator, while alloc_memarea() shares the page
pool with the buddy allocator.

the likelyhood of alloc_memarea() succeeding should be pretty good even on
loaded systems, once the two improvements i mentioned (zap clean pagecache
pages, reverse-flush & zap dirty pages) are added to it. Until then it's
indeed most effective at boot-time and deteriorates afterwards, so it
basically has bootmem's capabilities without most of the limitations of
bootmem.
