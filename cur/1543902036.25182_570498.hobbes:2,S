Subject: [PATCH 05/33] kbuild: avoid environment to set variables used by kbuild
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/17/233

A few of the variables used by kbuild has fixed naming.
Make sure we do not pick up random values from the environment.
