	Perhaps they could be a 'config' option, so if you really don't want
them you don't have to have them.  However, even in a compartmentalized
environment I could see legitimate room for ACLs.  If you want things completely
compartmentalized, let everyone operate in a chroot'ed environment where they
have their own sets of passwd files, and filesystems for that matter.  In any
case, what it sounds like you're doing really is trying to protect the user
from himself, which is not what I generally consider, and I don't think is
what we really want to go for.  When someone deletes a file, it goes away,
forever, it doesn't go into a recycle bin that the user can get it back out
of.

	If you don't want to look for ACLs, don't use --acl...  Also, find
is more of what I would call a 'search tool', and would be able to be
modified to handle ACLs.  I don't believe it would even be too hard, find
already offers all kinds of things to match against, adding another for
ACLs shouldn't be impossible.
