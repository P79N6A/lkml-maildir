Please revert the yenta free_irq on suspend patch (below)
which went into 2.6.13-rc4 after 2.6.13-rc3-git9.
Sorry Daniel, you may have a box on which resume doesn't work without
it, but on my laptop APM resume from RAM now fails to work because of
it - locks up solid.  The patch sounded rather fishy when it went in,
but I've done an unprejudiced bisection and this turns out to be the
culprit.  Perhaps it needs something more (I can try further patches),
but as it stands it's unsuitable for 2.6.13.
Do I recall a worry about shared interrupts?  I indeed have
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 0000:00:1f.1
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 0000:02:00.0
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 0000:02:00.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 0000:00:1f.1
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 0000:02:01.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 0000:02:01.1
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 0000:02:01.1
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 0000:02:01.0
on resume before that patch, and again now I've backed it out.
Thanks,
Hugh
