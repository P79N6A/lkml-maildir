yeah. I'd say your approach is to go from A to B:
  [A] -----------------------------------------------------> [B]
                                                              |
                                                             [C]
while there might be some other arguments that "no, lets go to C 
instead", i say lets not throw away the already implemented and already 
working and nicely layered [A]->[B] transition, just because there's an 
argument whether the end result should be 'B' or 'C'. Unless someone who 
wants to see 'C' produces a patchset that walks the whole way i dont see 
any reason to not go with your patchset. It clearly removes alot of 
cruft.
