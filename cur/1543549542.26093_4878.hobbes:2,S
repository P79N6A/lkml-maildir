<p><br>I think it has a lot to do with the kernel, and with X.&nbsp; Since
i havn't upgraded anything but X (and thus the extensions) ... now it's
obvious that X is at fault for providing us with a wonderful shared memory
leak.&nbsp; But, the kernel too, has something to do with it since test9
seems to be fairly unstable with it, causing all sorts of weird happenings
before totally freezing up like test8-vm3 does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This problems only manifests in VERY&nbsp;recent X cvs copies so most people
will not see this problem.&nbsp; The problem i'm wondering about is if
the Kernel is handling shared memory correctly or if this is entirely X's
fault.
