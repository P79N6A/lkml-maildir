This one has been discussed several times on the sparc-linux mailing
list :) See this thread:

Short summary:
In 2.6.x, you need to use x86-style keymaps instead of sunkeymap. In
Gentoo, you do this by editing the KEYMAP setting in /etc/rc.conf . In
Debian, use `dpkg-reconfigure console-data` to select an i386 keymap. In
other distros, do whatever it is that distro uses to select a keymap.
