If you can implement copy on write, you can implement abort on write.
And if you cannot implement copy on write, how do you implement
overcommitment?

Which means that even an overcommitting system can only share pages
between processes where the addresses were fixed up in the same way.
If run into this kind of thing, you can still make the shared library
read-only after the address fixup.

For fork/exec, you might want to have a "special" fork which is safer
than vfork but doesn't imply the need to reserve a copy of all the
writable data.  Or, as someone proposed, you fudge fork to allow a
limited form of overcommit until the next system call.
It was pointed out that stack growth is another problem, and it is
indeed one where a failure is even harder to recover from than from a
malloc failure.

It would be the program itself that marks pages read-only, so if these
pages are subsequently written to it either means they shouldn't have
been read-only (and the extra memory was needed after all), or there
was a hidden bug in program.

Actually banking is not a bad analogy: just remember that they are
subject to strict rules w.r.t. to the extent to which their cash
reserves may be overcommitted, and are also obliged to have the assets
to cover _all_ commitments.  Banks also differentiate between good and
bad risks.
In terms of risk it makes a real difference if you overcommitted 100MB
of de-facto read-only COW memory, or 10MB of de-facto read-write
memory: the latter commitment is the one that kills.
In general, my point is just that some advocates of overcommitment
exaggerate the amount of extra VM that a non-overcommitting system
would require.  An OOM situation is bad on both systems, though I
believe programs have a better chance of coping with it on a system
that doesn't overcommit.
If you have the infrastructure necessary to prevent overcommitment,
you are also in a position to allow it to a limited extent, or in
certain special cases.  Without that infrastructure, no-one has a
choice.
