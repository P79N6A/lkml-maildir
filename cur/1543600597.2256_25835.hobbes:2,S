I am trying to run a slip server on the linux 2.4. When i say
 slattach -p slip /dev/ttyS0 &
I get a message like
---INIT: Id "T1" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes---
 Why it is so though i have not defined any speed to serial device with -s
 option
Is it is due to because  kernel is  corrupt or some prob like that..
Please help
