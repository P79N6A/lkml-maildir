There are no short-term solusions and seems that __dma_buffer will not
be merged. It would be better to fix this soon though it's a bit hard
to fix this before 2.6.25, I think.

Not all of them are autosense. #2 is not related with autosense.
I think that the point is that #1 and #2 might use as many sense
buffers as can_queue. The differences are:
- For #1, we can attach sense_buffer only when necessary.
- For #2, we always need to attach sense_buffer before queuecommand.

scsi-ml needs more sense buffers than can_queue since
scsi_finish_command uses sense_buffer after calling
scsi_device_unbusy.

I see. I'll wait for your patches.
