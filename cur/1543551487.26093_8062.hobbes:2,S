The restart or continue behaviour is undefined unless you use sigaction()
to control your signal behaviour (see POSIX.1 or SuS). Even then your code
is buggy on every OS I know
Suppose this happens..
	alarm(1)
	[sudden swap frenzy]
	alarm is delivered.. do nothing
	read
blocks forever. You need to make clever use of siglongjmp to avoid that one
occurring or use select/poll.
