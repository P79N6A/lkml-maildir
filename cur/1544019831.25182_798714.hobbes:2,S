Don't make that assumption.  One of the small number of devices which 
really did have an odd number of sectors was an early iPod.

Are you aware of the last_sector_bug flag?  It prevents sectors near 
the end of the device from being accessed using anything other than 
single-sector reads or writes.  Some devices don't like it if, for 
example, you do a 2-sector read that includes the last sector.

Linux uses the last-sector accesses to check whether or not the device 
is part of a RAID.  Apparently Windows and OS X don't support the kinds 
of RAID that need this.
