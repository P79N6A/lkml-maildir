It's commented in Documentation/i386/boot.txt as well as the 
kernel-options file.  *ALL* i386 boot loaders need to obey this, 
unfortunately, because of how the initrd protocol was defined.

No, and that's exactly the problem.  A whole bunch of crap was added to 
mem= retroactively (over my explicit objections), and that broke the 
boot protocol.
