But that does not seem to be the argument here. Rather, it is "I can  
certainly see where this can cause harm, but I cannot see where it is  
useful for anything at all, so why do we have it?".

What is X, Y and Z in this particular case? Nobody seems to have said  
that.
Incidentally, this thread is *very* similar to the "mount the exact same  
FS several times on the exact same mountpoint" thing. I'd expect to get a  
similar resolution (i.e., *don't* allow that).
