Yes. We didn't do it in the first version of this patch to avoid
touching too many files. 
We do have the full version of dprobes which has generic bits
and arch-specific ones cleanly seperated. In fact, dprobes ports
are available for ia32, s390, s390x, ppc with ppc64 and ia64 ports
in early stages. Please check out:
