In the case of the windfarm driver, the sysfs files are reporting
things like cpu voltage, current, temperature etc. which can be
interesting to know about, but the sysfs files are not essential to
the operation of the driver.  So just some cheesy printk would do in
that sort of situation, I guess.

In that case a WARN_ON inside device_create_file when the duplicate is
detected would be better - less code, and only one place where the
check needs to be done.  The WARN_ON will give us a backtrace so we
can see where the second creation attempt happened.

So we have to add printks in all sorts of places where the
device_create_file has never failed before.  If you're that concerned,
why not add a WARN_ON(error) in device_create_file() ?
