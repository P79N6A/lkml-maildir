Nope, that would be torture for Linus... At least unless they were neatly
explained and separated into categories & non-interdependant.

I believe that the most important thing for a such list would be to debate
the future of the kernel and its features, NOT to bounce patches/code.
Until we have actually come up with nice concepts, it's too early to
implement anyway. And I think that Linus need to participate to stop the
meaningless ideas. After all, if the ideas doesn't pass Linus, it won't
get into the kernel in the first place anyway...
