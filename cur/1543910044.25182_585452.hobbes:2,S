Subject: [-mm PATCH] DMA engine kconfig improvements (rev2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/16/335

From: Adrian Bunk <bunk@stusta.de>
This patch contains the following changes to the DMA engine menus:
- switch to menuconfig
- INTEL_IOATDMA must depend on X86
- INTEL_IOATDMA must select DCA
- device drivers shouldn't "default m"
- DCA shouldn't be a user visible option
- make it clear in the INTEL_IOATDMA help text that this driver is for
  rare hardware the user most likely doesn't has
- let DMA_ENGINE be select'ed by the DMA devices, making it less likely
  for a user to accidentally enable NET_DMA
[dan.j.williams@intel.com: fix up Kconfig text]
