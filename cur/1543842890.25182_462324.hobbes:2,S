Well, as I said, I don't think we ever saw a case that was demonstrably
due to the 256 sector issue. And I really don't think it is as obscure a
fact that people seem to think it is.

It should be pretty trivial to reach, the other IDE limits are basically
way beyond 128kb of contig io. People are hitting this during boot even
I bet, so...

If the firmware is really buggy in that it doesn't recognise the 0 case
as being 256, you'd see immediate transfer errors. This going by
unnoticed is highly unlikely.
