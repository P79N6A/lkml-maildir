A strong point in favor of unification is the possibility of additional
system management drivers, outside of ACPI and APM.  Embedded targets,
or platforms with crappy BIOS, might choose to implement power
management natively, like the temporary PIIX4 ACPI kernel driver did.  I
want to implement native power management for this old i430GX, which has
an APM status port and APM control port, and a really crappy APM BIOS.
If we are to have generic power management in the kernel, there needs to
be some effort to support that in userspace.  I think it would lead to
code duplication if you have a daemon for every interface...  A generic
PM daemon should suffice for most tasks, but specialized stuff can
either be hooked in as an .so module, compiled into the generic PM
daemon, or whatnot...  Having a central userspace daemon also allows
synchronization of tasks when suspending, resuming, ejecting, etc.
