I meant for a stright compile, which is going to be its worst case and
my common case.
The main thing I like is to be able to compile out of the tree and
avoiding touching the header files during compilation (that's really
annoying).

I personally don't care about correctness in the sense of getting "make"
doing everything for you regardless of what you changed, I'm fine with
some "make distclean" forced checkpoint after PATCHLEVEL changed etc...,
you said infact full compile is needed sometime, not to tell about
kernel configuration.
One good example is the mkdep hack, it's far from correct: the header
dependences is nearly random.  We cannot trust it unless we remeber
every user included us (one more reason I'm used to full recompiles),
but it's much faster than the correct full dependences generated by gcc
so I'm fine with it. When I compile other projects like kde2 I'm amazed
how slow the compilation is, ok it's not stright C but I bet the
correctness of its dependences hits a lot too on the compilation time
(but it's rebuilt in background so I don't care if it's slow while for
the kernel I'm sometime more synchronous waiting for the compilation to
finish :).

First backout Linus's pre patch, then apply AC's -ac. The end result is
a backwards SUBLEVEL.
