I think I'm channeling the AFS developers when I boggle at this... files are 
identified by 4-tuples in AFS (and Coda, which is based on AFS).  "By path" 
is rather difficult when a remote cell's file server can't possibly know 
*where* its volume is mounted in my local cell's AFS tree (nothing but a 
desire to easily identify what's going on just by looking at the path stops 
me from doing "fs mkmount ~/.private/pafs/foo remote.cell:volume.name" where 
"volume.name" is not "root.cell" --- and even the latter is just a 
convention).  The local client resolves the pathname to the appropriate 
4-tuple and then hands that off to the remote cell's servers.  The only 
fixed requirement is that there is exactly one mount point for the AFS 
client's root cell on a local filesystem (by convention, 
$(</usr/vice/etc/ThisCell):root.afs on /afs).
Or I could use "arlad -d", which behaves much like an FTP client for 
browsing AFS volumes (compare to Samba's Unix SMB client...).  The path is 
irrelevant, as I can tell it to mount as a root cell any volume I can access 
in any cell I can access.
Pathnames are less than usable on a global filesystem.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
