NAK. 
It is broken as it breaks init time ordering relied upon by many
drivers for same probing and it breaks existing drive assumptions that
the probe is single threaded and therefore unlocked.
At the very least it needs
	&& !IDE && !WATCHDOG && !ATA
and probably far more.
This should not be enabled or even in the upstream tree until the
ordering problem is fixed and the submitter has done a review and fix of
all the locking.
