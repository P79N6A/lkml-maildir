In addition, the radeon DRI shouldn't do active spinning like that in
"normal" circumstances ... it should instead block on interrupts. if it
does, I suppose that could safely be considered as a bug in the radeon
DRM/DRI driver. It will do such loops on engine reset and such, which
happen on X launch, VT switches or in case of lockups... I have to
double check what happens in the code path used for 2d/3d transitions
though, those might be a problem.
