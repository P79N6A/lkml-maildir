Actually the question is, is it a nice idea for drivers to disable
interrupts for no obvious reason. I'm sure you have a reason, but it's not
obvious to me why. What does it protect? Is it SMP safe?
When tuning a RT system for the customer, the first thing we recommend is
to check to make sure all the drivers in use do not disable interrupts.

We do have the local_irq_save_nort that Mike has posted.  This is a simple
wrapper around local_irq_save that enables it when RT is not configured,
and is a nop when RT is configured.
