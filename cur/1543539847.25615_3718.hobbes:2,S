	It's not non-ATA commands, it's using a raw interface provided by
the spec to send commands to the drive not in the spec.  At least that's
what I understand from what's been bouncing back and forth and what Andre's
said.  
	Perhaps I'm wrong, but I don't really see that it matters.  The
patch to 'fix' this was rather large and in the end has no *real* net
effect.  Hitting this by accident is an *extremely* rare case (having not
ever been noted before) and if a root personage wants to do it, this isn't
going to stop them, even a little bit.  So what does it get us in the end?
Just more cruft in the kernel.
