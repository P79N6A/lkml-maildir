Great, thanks Andi.  One small correction to the comment...

No, the problem hasn't knowingly been sighted on ipr, it was the
st driver that Ryan's been seeing it with - ipr just came from
my looking around for like instances.

Below is, I think, the 2.6.15 equivalent of the patch Andi posted.
Ryan cannot effectively test Andi's patch on 2.6.16-rc because Mike
Christie's scsi_execute_async changes have serendipitously fixed
the st instance.  Ryan, would you be able to test the patch below
on 2.6.15 without my st.c,st.h patch?
But I fear Ryan may be growing a little tired of this surfeit
of fixes: he's waited months for one, now he's been given one
workaround and three fixes.
Thanks,
Hugh
