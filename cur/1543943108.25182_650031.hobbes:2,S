 +ACPI-WMI mapping driver
 +
 +Copyright (C) 2007-2008 Carlos Corbacho <carlos@strangeworlds.co.uk>

 +Updated: 5th February 2008
 +
 +1) About this guide
 +
 +This guide is a basic introduction on how to interact with the ACPI-WMI mapper
 +driver in the kernel - it presumes you already have a basic knowledge of
 +ACPI-WMI, ACPI and the hardware you are writing the driver for.
 +
 +2) What is ACPI-WMI
 +
 +At its simplest, ACPI-WMI is a proprietary extension to the ACPI specification
 +from Microsoft to allow WMI (their implementation of WBEM) to access
 +instrumentation data and methods in ACPI from userspace, via the ACPI _HID
 +device PNP0C14.
 +
 +3) What is the ACPI-WMI mapper
 +
 +The Linux ACPI-WMI driver is the implementation of this mapper for Linux.
Yes, please. This needs translation into plain english.
What is WBEM, in plain terms? What is it good for?
