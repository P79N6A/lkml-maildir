Doing another grep seems to imply that none of the other drivers even
allow as small chunks as the sb driver does, 32 byte "events" is just
ridiculous. At simple 2-channel, 16-bits, CD-quality sound, that's a DMA
event every 0.18 msec (5500 times a second, 181 _micro_seconds appart).
I obviously agree that the app shouldn't even ask for small chunks:
whether a mp3 player reacts within 1/10th or 1/1000th of a second of the
user asking it to switch tracks, nobody can even tell. So an mp3 player
should probably use a big fragment size on the order of 4kB or similar
(that still gives max fragment latency of 0.022 seconds, faster than
humans can react).
So it sounds like a player sillyness, but I don't think the driver should
even allow such waste of resources, considering that no other driver
allows it either..
