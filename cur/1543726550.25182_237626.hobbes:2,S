I'm going to bump this topic a bit, since it's been a while..
There are still some issues with ide-cd's SG_IO, listed from
most important as percieved by me to least:
 * Read-only access grants you the ability to write/blank media in the drive
 * (with above) You can open the device only in read-only mode.
 * You can't open the device unless there is media in the drive
 * Still seems to be no way to specify scatter gather/dma buffers yourself,
   though I'm not entirely sure that matters anyway.
The read-only granting write/blank seems like a pretty serious security issue
to me.  Not being able to open the device without media is merely extremely
annoying (and I suspect fixing it would break a lot of programs).
