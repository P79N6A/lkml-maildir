We normally try to at least support all ioctls which are used in 
standard distributions as 32bit. This way users can easily switch
between 32bit and 64bit userland. The coverage is very good
(standing on the shoulders of sparc64 emulation gigants).
Of course 64bit tools exist, just the 64bit distributions are not commonly
available yet and it's still nice to switch at will.
Also some ports rely on emulation for all user land (sparc64, ppc64, mips64);
for these it would be eventually needed anyways.

That is currently done (-EINVAL), but the emulation layer logs an 
warning.

That's bad. Do they at least have unique numbers?

So far it works.
