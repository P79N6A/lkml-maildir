Quoting Albert D. Cahalan (acahalan@cs.uml.edu):

Capabilities are there to increase security. Anyone who seriously wants
security will not use NFS. 
Breaking other tools like tar and friends I see as a serious issue, but NFS,
never.
But when introducing capabilities and ACLs one will need new archival programs
that take care of them anyway. Anything that does not support them directly
will probably end up as a tool to break them.
