Unfortunately, this doesn't fix it for me.
horizontal scrolling in angband is still very broken, and vertical
scrolling (even as simple as recalling previous command-lines in bash)
is also still broken.
For example, recalling the previous commandline goes OK the first time,
and the second time, part of the line is shifted some 120 characters to
the right.
Sorry,
Jurriaan
