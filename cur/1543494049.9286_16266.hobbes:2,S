Guessing wildly but educatedly, I'd say someone is counting timer ticks in a
32-Bit unsigned. The alpha's timer interrupts at 1024Hz AFAIK which would
result in said 48 days.
    Rahul> Has this been seen before, and is it fixed in the newer kernels?
Haven't looked into it (see above), but I hope it will be fixed, otherwise
the i386 machines will have the same problem, even if only after over a year.
(Yes, linux is provably stable enough to keep up that long !)
