We did go through all this after the first or second incarnation of
this patch, back in May.  After going around in circles for a bit, the
use of casts seemed then to win the day.
If Linus has a major objection I'll redo things.
The main advantage of casts, to me at present, is it allows the
patches to be incremental.  Not all places that should be sector_t are
yet --- some are int, and some are long.  Casting them all to unsigned
long long and printing with %llu works now, before all the places are
changed (in patch 3 or 4 IIRC).

You are lost in a maze of BitKeeper repositories, all almost the same.
