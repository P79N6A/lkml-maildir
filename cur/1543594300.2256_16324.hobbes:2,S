So we end up with a single domain and max 256 buses. Still, it's not 
behavior one can count on. Sun's U2P PCI controller certainly creates 
a new PCI domain for each controller. It's easier in architectures 
other than IA32, in a way, since they typically don't have the 64KB 
IO-space addressing limitation that makes heavily bridged systems 
problematical on IA32 (one tends to run out of IO space).
