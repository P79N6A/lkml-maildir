Yes. We discussed that with Linus back then. The problem is that the
printk subsystem tend to abuse calling low level drivers at interrupt
time, and in the case of blanking/unblanking, this can be a problem.
Radeonfb for example relies on beeing able to schedule() at
blank/unblank time.
If this "feature" is really important, maybe the best is to trigger the
workqueue and do the ublank from there.
