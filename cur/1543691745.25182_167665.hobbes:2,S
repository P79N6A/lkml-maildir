Ouch? This is just an information string, it is not supposed to be used
anywhere except printks etc ... I really HOPE nobody is parsing these
strings.
Before the patch, the input_dev.name string said
"Synaptics Synaptics Pad", which kind of didn't make much sense.
Since it's a concatenation of protocol, vendor and device names, it
now says
"SynPS/2 Synaptics Pad", which sounds a bit better.

If it breaks anything, that needs to be fixed in what it broke, because
nothing should depend on this. If it does, then that's a big bug.
