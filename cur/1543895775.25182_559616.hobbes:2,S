Maybe, but in what numbers? It's not like every user out there is able
to scratch their itches in the first place. Besides, people who want
to hack their hardware either work around the restrictions (like Linux
on xbox) or buy hardware that doesn't have any.
In any case, I hope we call quits on this thread. People have already
explained to you that there are certain devices (ATMs, medical
equipment) where you absolutely want "tivoization". Furthermore, Linus
has repeatedly explained to you why he (and bunch of other _kernel_
hackers -- this is a thread on LKML, remember) thinks it's stupid for
a software license to restrict hardware design choices. If you don't
see the point, fine, but lets stop wasting each others time, ok?
