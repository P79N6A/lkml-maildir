: When the news broke today that Microsoft and AT&T were going to do some
: work together the entire issue of how someone looks at Linux became very
: clear. It is not that Ken Thompson is some evil Linux basher, its just
: that for most of his working life, the way he has been judged by those who
: pay him is based on the commercial use of his work (for this reason
: Plan-9 is not so good).
:
: I would guess that Ma Bell is his number one lady, and anyone she likes,
: he likes. 
Do you realize what an incredible insult this?  You just flatly stated that
Ken has no intellectual integrity.  
This is unacceptable behaviour.  Please go away.
