Under 2.6 local group membership was expanded to 65536. NFS, however,
is a standard separate from Linux, and it imposes a limit of 16 groups
on the wire for the AUTH_UNIX credentials.
If all your client systems are Linux, you can use the patch at:
    
http://www.frankvm.com/nfs-ngroups/
as a work around. (Only the client systems need the patch.)
I haven't used it myself, so best of luck.
