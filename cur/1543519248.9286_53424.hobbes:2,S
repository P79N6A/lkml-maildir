Since moving from 2.3.28 to 2.3.29 (and still present in 2.3.31)
my system locks up when starting X.
It only locks up if my ttyS3 serial device is open.  I've been able to
reproduce the lockup with SuperProbe.
The serial port is at 
	02e8-02ef : serial(set)
The probe writes 0x55555555 into 0x42ec which appears to land in
0x02ec which is the UART status and control registers.
The serial driver immediately services an interrupt with a 0x75 in the
LSR, then about 512 iterations with 0x61 in the LSR, as shown by the
printk("DR%02x... in serial.c.   After that the system is hung solid.
Is it normal that an outl(0x42ec,...) should land on 0x02ec?  Even
possible?  (I could be deluded here.)
I'm proceeding to analyze by testing to see if 0x02ec and 0x42ec are
really the same ioports and then determining if that changed from 
my 2.3.28 to 2.3.29 kernel, but I could use some better direction if
anyone has ideas.
(Please cc me on replies, I'm not subscribed and read a delayed version
