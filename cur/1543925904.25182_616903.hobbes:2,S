What are "significant updates"?
Sometimes one person makes one small patch and this patch contains
a typo.

We have some open drivers/ata/ regressions.
I see some person named "Mark Lord" being responsible for 4 commits.
What pubishment do you plan for him if 2.6.24 ships with any libata 
regressions?
Let George W. Bush wrongly accuse him of possessing weapons of 
mass destructions and invade Canada?

Bullshit.
Bug fixing is not about finding someone to blame, it's about getting the 
bug fixed.
The bug reporter is the person who can reproduce the problem, and if 
it's a regression then bisecting is the natural way of getting nearer 
at getting it fixed.
