In that case, it's either a compiler bug or a race condition.
Compiling this source file with the -S option will generate an assembly output.
The output should be the same regardless of whether you use the temp variable or
not.  That will answer the question as to what the cause is.  If you're lucky,
it's a compiler bug, because they're easier to fix.
