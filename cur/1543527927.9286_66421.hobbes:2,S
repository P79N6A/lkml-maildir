First of all, top does not lie. You need to upgrade top.

(well, I suppose the timestamp register hack would help)
Note that "idle" time refers to the CPU, not your disks.
Having a /proc/0 is great as long as it is an invisible directory.
It would have to be a special case I think, because SMP would give
you more than one /proc/0 AFAIK. (which of the many could you use?)
