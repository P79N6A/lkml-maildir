Ah, thank you for the feedback, I should change this, since it seems to be
not so much descriptive.
Functionally the same as tty_wakeup, but it can be used in code, which is
expected to be fast and short (e.g. interrupt handler), since the wakeup is
scheduled and done in the future.

I want to use it in all char drivers, which schedules a work only for
tty_wakeup() calling, because they don't want to include more code in
interrupt handlers for example (if I understand the code correctly, e.g.
n_tty discipline may invoke whole fasync machinery on tty_wakeup call).
If somebody thinks it's not needed (or it's overkill), the other approach
comes -- change all wakeup schedules with simple tty_wakeup().
thanks.
