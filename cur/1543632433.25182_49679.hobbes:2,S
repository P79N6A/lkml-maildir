Piecemal is not about splitting the patch in small bits only.
It's about adding features one-by-one, and about fixing bugs one-by-one.
Forget the story that current kbuild-2.5 needs the core in order to
enable any functionality.
A small list of stuff independent of the core stuff:
o New defconfig target
o New installable target
o Replacement of installkernel script with a couple of commandline options
o asmoffset stuff, allthough not used for i386 at present
o The idea behind _shipped prefix on shipped files
o randconfig, warnings in split-include, mkdep, 2048 symbol limit, dbl qoutes
o Quit output, making warnings more visible
o etc.
I think Linus did not want to take a patch that changed too much, and
thats what kbuild-2.5 does. This does not change when you split it up
file by file.
