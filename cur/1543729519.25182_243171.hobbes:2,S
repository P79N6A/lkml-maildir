Or, if not pgoff_t, introduce a pfn_t for this purpose, an unsigned
arithmetic type of architecture-dependent width (such systems may not
want 64-bit page indices and the like for various reasons). But
exhibiting a system with the need for such is yet to be done, and in
fact, even with a 32B struct page, 16TB RAM (the minimum required to
trigger more physical address bits >= BITS_PER_LONG + PAGE_SHIFT) has
a 128GB mem_map[] with 4KB pages, an 8GB mem_map[] with 64KB pages,
and so will have far, far deeper support issues than pfn overflows.
Even supposing a kernel could be made to boot and the like, the massive
internal fragmentation from using a large enough emulated PAGE_SIZE to
get mem_map[] to fit within virtualspace will surely render such a
machine completely useless, likely to the point of being unable to run
userspace, or panicking much earlier from boot-time allocation failures.
