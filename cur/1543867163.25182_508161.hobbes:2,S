While working on a new device node, i stumbled across a similar issue
where attaching the frontend failed due to some sort of memory
corruption. This was seen as all the callbacks suddenly just vanished,
eventhough it existed in the driver
At that point, i figured it could be something due to an error at my
side , since the device that i was working was a bit complex and had
API changes as well.
Thanks for pointing it out. It looks like the issue sounds similar.
regards,
Manu
