i suspect the difference is that my system is not saturated. (has CPU
cycles left). I'm saturating the TCP pipe (107MB/sec) and the gigabit
card, while you are saturated CPU-power-wise. So it's pretty natural that
if the CPU is too busy processing frames, workload gets clustered up into
bigger chunks. Also, on which side do you have 2.5K ints/sec?
another difference might be TX interrupts - i'm using a TX interrupt per
TX-ed descriptor (this way descriptors get freed up ASAP and the outgoing
pipe can be restarted quickly), but i'll switch to the logic i've added to
eepro100.c: cluster TX interrupts if the queue is not full (there is no
danger of Tx descriptor shortage in this case), and if the queue gets full
then stop the queue until a certain number (# != 1) of descriptors have
been freed. (hysteresis) [There might be some difference in queueing here
since i'm doing this based on Alexey's softnet 'next generation
networking' code.]
if we (or the card) are clustering incoming frames even if load is not
high, thats a latency problem - we want to know about available frames as
soon as possible.
