Subject: PROBLEM: memory leak in LIST_*, TAILQ_* man page

My apologies if this is the wrong mailing list;  I didn't find a better one.
The man page for TAILQ_REMOVE, etc. contains the following sample code:
while (head.tqh_first != NULL)
     TAILQ_REMOVE(&head, head.tqh_first, entries);
I checked /usr/include/sys/queue.h and, sure enough, TAILQ_REMOVE 
doesn't free
head.tqh_first.  Nor should it-- this isn't Objective-C, after all. :-)
It should be something like:
while (head.tqh_first != NULL) {
              np = head.tqh_first;
              TAILQ_REMOVE(&head, np, entries);
              free(np);
}
The same bug is repeated for all the data structures in this man page.
In this day and age of Java, C#, and Objective-C programmers, kids these 
days
are less likely to remember to clean up after themselves.  Therefore it was
particularly jarring to find this bug.  Ten years ago I might have 
laughed it
off.  That's probably why it's been around for so long.
