I have a similar problem with a hard disk enclosure.  However, instead of 
getting corruption, the device just stops responding and the activity light 
on the enclosure stays pinned.  Then, even after power-cycling the disk, I'm 
not able to remount it; I have to reboot.  Removing all of the USB modules 
and re-loading them doesn't seem to help either.
I'll post usb-storage verbose debugging output when I have some.
