I'm not the original poster, and I haven't read this whole thread yet,
but I may have some useful input...
I think I'm seeing this problem (with the same symptoms) with both e100
and 8139too, on two different machines. It started with 2.6.10-rc1-bk24;
bk23 works fine.
I haven't tested my e100 system (laptop) as thoroughly as my 8139too system
(desktop), but this is what I'm seeing with 8139too:
Adding pci=routeirq makes the problem go away. Using acpi=off *instead* of
pci=routeirq also makes the problem go away. If I use "noapic" instead
of acpi=off or pci=routeirq, I get a different variant of the problem:
Almost immediately after resume, there's a kernel log message that the
NIC's interrupt has been disabled (I forget the exact wording). Checking
/proc/interrupts shows that the NIC's interrupt (which is not shared
with any other devices) has shot up to 100000 interrupts. (This
phenomenon does not happen if I do not specify noapic.)
Now I'll go and read the rest of this thread. If there's any more
information I need to provide or anything else I need to try, let me
know.
