For better bug reports, 16K is peanuts. We had exactly the same straw-man
come up when kksymoops was first proposed. And now, most people don't run
without it.
I've seen numerous cases where reporters have hand transcribed BUG() reports,
and got the line numbers wrong because they misremembered a 4 digit number.
Words are inherently easier to remember, and even if typoed, usually there's
enough context to figure out what the problem was without another round-trip
to the bug reporter.
If this were optional, I don't see how anyone can argue against it,
and that should be a trivial improvement to Eric's existing patch.
