Something between bigmem and his big VM changes makes reiserfs
uncompilable.  I stay with the stock VM and its only under significant
load that it falls over and starts messing with the smooth continuity of
X pointer movement and mp3 decoding.
Surely though I can't be the only person with an SMP system experiencing
the pointless cpu chewing while idle without Marcelo's sync_page_buffers()
fix?  Again, Andrea's SMP patches are worth a look too as most of them are
so simple even I can see they make sense.  No problems yet on a UP
system with them patched in either.
