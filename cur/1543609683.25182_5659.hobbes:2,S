Another thing to remember about Athlons is they need power and cooling. I've seen many a system with either a cheap power supply or a poorly ventilated case,
and often both. Athlons WILL push the hardware harder, not to mention the power they suck down themselves, and need a power supply that can handle the load as
well as the fast switching transitions. They also require more cooling, and not just on the CPU, but also on the chipset and throughout the case.
My dual 1.4GHz (K7 Thunder) has 12 fans in it. My single 1.4GHz has 8. They both have 400W+ power supplies.
