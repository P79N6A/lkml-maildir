I agree, there should be a config option to build the kernel with the 
debug support entirely shut off, though it's a good idea to leave it on 
if you aren't really cramped for space.

Would you prefer there not be any debug messages at all, rather than 
ones you have to figure out how to turn on and interpret?  Documentation 
is always a good thing, but if you are at least somewhat familiar with 
the code, turning on the debug messages should be easy and rather helpful.
BTW, didn't I see something recently in the kernel about a debug fs? 
Sounded like that was intended for this sort of thing to provide a 
standard interface to configuring fine grained debug message filtering.
