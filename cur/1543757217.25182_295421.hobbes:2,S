Using /dev/hda0 as root seems a little strange to me, as the usual way
of naming partitions starts with 1 (so the first partition would be
/dev/hda1).  However the kernel seems to be finding and starting your
init executable, so that likely isn't your problem.
I would suggest starting by using a statically linked shell as your init
and building up from there.
