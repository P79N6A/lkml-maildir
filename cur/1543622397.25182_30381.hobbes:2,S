I disagree: requiring aio to execute completion in user context means 
that we can no longer have quick completion directly from an interrupt 
handler to a busy server executing in userland.
That said, it is possible to do the same partial completion as is done 
with file descriptors from interrupt context for pages, but it'll be 
*really* gross.  Freeing pages should be possible from any context IMO.

Uhm, what about the network stack?
