 	Next point of discussion must be PI . Considering that this 
implementation is lacking it. Maybe it wouldn't be "lightweight" if it was 
included.
 	If PI is to be added to Linux it will need to encompass both 
mutex implementations . Was this a consideration in the design of these 
lightweight futexes?
