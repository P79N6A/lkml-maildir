-git5 works, -git7 showed reiserfs corruption. -git6 died, jumped from
__do_softirq to 0x0, will try once again.
git5->6 has the mutex changes, but also lots of powerpc changes. Lets
see if I can narrow it down further.
The ibook has 160mb, installation is done via modular nfs
(ro,v3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,hard,nolock,proto=tcp,addr=1.1.1.3)
I havent seen this on a B&W G3 with 256mb, nor on other ppc32 systems.
