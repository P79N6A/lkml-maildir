Yes, on s390 the PTEs cannot be asynchronous because there is no need to
synchronize them in the first place. A mapping layer with all primitives
without using the SIE instruction will be difficult. For one we cannot
use the ESSA instruction which isolates the state changes and host page
table is tied to the SIE. The page state is stored in the page table
extension and the discard state is basically a specially marked invalid
pte in the host table. A mapping layer with some restrictions is
certainly possible.

If you have to walk the guest page tables you call into the guest, no ?
I would characterize this more as a ballooner since you need guest
activity to do the page stealing. The trick with guest page hinting is
that you do NOT call into the guest to do the discard. You'll a nested
page table for that I'm afraid.

We had quite a few of these racy failures. Nasty. Hard to find.
