That's not scalable, since the upstream tree should not bottleneck on 
another tree.
If "prism54 dev team" are active maintainers, and respond to feedback 
and users patches, _most_ patches will come from you.  But this is never 
a guarantee...  Also, you should expect that developers often work 
exclusively with the upstream tree, so patches from outside developers 
will be diff'd against latest upstream BK.
I think we all want the same thing...  a decent prism54 maintained by 
folks that know it best.  For the prism54 dev team, that means keeping 
track of any upstream changes.  For the Linux community's part, the 
standard etiquette is to mail a patch to the driver's maintainer. 
Sometimes this etiquette is bypassed for stuff like:  first-time merges, 
changes that affect large numbers of drivers (of which prism54 just 
happens to be one of) in Linux, and simple build fixes from architecture 
maintainers.
