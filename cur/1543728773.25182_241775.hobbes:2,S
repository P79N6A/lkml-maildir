I waited for 5 mins before sysrq-U && sysrq-R.
Anyway, if I 'killall pppd' and then issue 'ifconfig -a' the ifconfig
command will hang.
This didn't happen with 2.6.8-rc2-bk11 (the one I'm running now), so
something changed... I'm I the only one with ppp/pppd/pppoe who tried
2.6.8-rc4-bk1? :-) Any success reports?
