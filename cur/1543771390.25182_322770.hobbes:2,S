I will try and do that when I get a chance.  I can also try it on a
machine with an add in ehci card (Via KT133 chipset + NEC ehci card).

Well the SATA is using an Sil3112A controller.  Not sure how fast they
are.
The system also isn't entirely idle, so who knows what might affect the
speed.  I only get 30M/s at the moment on the same type of WD 120G SATA
drive on an ICH5R chipset, although I am pretty sure I have got more
than that when it was idle before.
