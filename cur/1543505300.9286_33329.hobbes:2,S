It's got a faster design.  It also provides mirroring, journalling, and
striping within the file system.  It is what built Novell's 20 billion
dollar empire, and now it belongs to all of us, including you Pavel.  It
doesn have limitations as well, likje everything, but it is the fastest
networking File System ever created when run within Native Netware.
