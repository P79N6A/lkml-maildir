gcc tends to show up hardware problems, however if you could use the old
compiler reliably thats not neccessarily fitting the pattern well. 
rpm --verify will let you check packages installed correctly
In general though
If the error is at the same spot each time - suspect software
If the error is in different spots when you rerun the same make -
suspect hardware
Also check you have swap space so are not running out of RAM
