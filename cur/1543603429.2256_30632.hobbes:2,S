hi,
	just wanted to let you know that your blacklist of
	ata-100 drives for HPT3 is most likely overzealous.
	as you state you tested it only with 41gb.
	I own
		IBM's 61gb IC35L060AVER07-0 drive.
		ABIT KG7-RAID with HPT370
	First I have been running "Linux version 2.4.2-2" RH7.1
	and this sets the above setup to ATA-100 and I had not
	experienced any problems.
	Once I "upgraded" to 2.4.10 my drive got blacklisted and
	runs as ata-44.
	to double check, I removed the driver from blacklist for
	100 and 66 and recompiled kernel, and it seems to be
	running fine so far.
now there's weird part, for both drive running at ATA-44 and ATA-100
I get pretty much same numbers from hdparam. Perhaps it just an change to
printf alone, and drive runs at ata-100 even it if says that it is ata-44
? what kind of numbers should I expect from ATA-100 drive anyway?
