autofs uses the following algorithm to determine if an address is
local: connect to it as the remote end using a datagram socket (so
there isn't any actual network traffic).  If the LOCAL address (which
is picked by the system) and the REMOTE address (the address under
test) are identical afterwards, the address is local.
