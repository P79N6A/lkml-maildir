My bad, sorry.

We're still using the amd_flash-driver a lot because I haven't got time
to try out the jedec_probe since the toggle-bit stuff was added in the
CFI driver. I made some rough tests just before that, and jedec_probe +
CFI driver turned out to be much slower than amd_flash. But then the CFI
driver was modified... I'll try to get some time to test them again soon
and maybe even do something about it.
