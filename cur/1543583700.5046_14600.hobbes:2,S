In initscripts create a directory with mode=700. Create a subdirectory there.
Mount procfs on it. Get the information. umount. rmdir. rmdir. Put that
information into /etc. Let your program use that as config file.
If attacker is able to traverse root-owned directory with rwx------ when
initscripts are run he won't gain anything new from accessing procfs, since
he already can do whatever he bloody wants.
Besides, that way it's easy to port to non-Linux boxen - all system
dependencies are in the way to have /etc/memsize set by the time when
your program is run. Which can be done by echo/ed/vi/whatever.
