Well I quess that you should have to use cap_from_text() which is in the
standard add a few fake caps that really are groups of other real caps.
Then if you kill CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH later on you can expand it behind the
scenes later by just making it a fake cap that really is a set of real
caps.

Yes I guess you have to resolve some things at run time.

you think it is broken cause I think pI and fI should be strictly a
limiting factor they should never cause a child process to gain caps the
parent never had.

I don't want lenient, I want more strictness on how caps are gained
ie. through fP *only* .

Warning when I mention capabilites I mean "soiled" capabilities not "pure".
Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
