That option is a lot harder than I thought.  This requires an array to
keep intermediate result of preallocated "lo" device, blk_queue, and
disk structure before calling add_disk() or register region.  And this
array could be potentially 1 million entries.  Maybe I will use
vmalloc for it, but seems rather sick.
