Subject: [PATCH 1/6] regulator: consumer driver regulator control framework.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/20/365

This framework provides voltage and current regulator control to allow
consumer drivers to control their supply voltages and current levels.
The framework is similar to the kernel clock interface in that client or
consumer drivers can get() and put() a regulator (like they can with clocks
atm).
Consumers can also get() or set() :- voltage, current, operating mode.
Consumers can also enable and disable regulators.
The framework also compiles out if not in use so drivers can be reused in
systems with no software PMIC power control.

+ *
+ * Regulator Client Interface.
+ *
+ * A Power Management Regulator framework for SoC based devices.
+ * Features:-
+ *   o Voltage and current level control.
+ *   o Operating mode control.
+ *   o Regulator status.
+ *   o sysfs entries for showing client devices and status
+ *
+ * EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES:
+ *   Dynamic Regulator operating Mode Switching (DRMS) - allows regulators
+ *   to use most efficient operating mode depending upon voltage and load and
+ *   is transparent to client drivers.
+ *
+ *   e.g. Devices x,y,z share regulator r. Device x and y draw 20mA each during
+ *   IO and 1mA at idle. Device z draws 100mA when under load and 5mA when
+ *   idling. Regulator r has > 90% efficieny in NORMAL mode at loads > 100mA
+ *   but this drops rapidly to 60% when below 100mA. Regulator r has > 90%
+ *   efficiency in IDLE mode at loads < 10mA. Thus regulator r will operate
+ *   in normal mode for loads > 10mA and in IDLE mode for load <= 10mA.
+ *
+ *   Dynamic Regulator Voltage Selection (DRVS). Selects the lowest voltage
+ *   output (within system constraints) for a regulator shared between several
+ *   devices. This allows all devices to operate within their voltage range and
+ *   will dynamically change the voltage when devices disable() thier supply
+ *   to the next best level (thus saving power). This is based on an idea
+ *   by Amit Kucheria in an RFC to lakml.
+ *
+ *   e.g. devices x,y,z share regulator r. device x and y can operate between
+ *   1800mV and 1900mV, whilst device z can only operate at 1900mV. Regulator
+ *   r will output 1900mV when all devices are in use and 1800mV when devices
+ *   x and y are in use and device z is disabled.

+ * Regulator operating modes.
+ *
+ * Regulators can run in a variety of different operating modes depending on
+ * output load. This allows further system power savings by selecting the
+ * best (and most efficient) regulator mode for a desired load.
+ *
+ * Most drivers will only care about NORMAL. The modes below are generic and
+ * will probably not match the naming convention of your regulator data sheet
+ * but should match the use cases in the datasheet.
+ *
+ * In order of power efficiency (least efficient at top).
+ *
+ *  Mode       Description
+ *  FAST       Regulator can handle fast changes in it's load.
+ *             e.g. useful in CPU voltage & frequency scaling where
+ *             load can quickly increase with CPU freqency increases.
+ *
+ *  NORMAL     Normal regulator power supply mode. Most drivers will
+ *             use this mode.
+ *
+ *  IDLE       Regulator runs in a more efficient mode for light
+ *             loads. Can be used for devices that have a low power
+ *             requirement during periods of inactivity. This mode
+ *             may be more noisy than NORMAL and may not be able
+ *             to handle fast load switching.
+ *
+ *  STANDBY    Regulator runs in the most efficient mode for very
+ *             light loads. Can be used by devices when they are
+ *             in a sleep/standby state. This mode is likely to be
+ *             the most noisy and may not be able to handle fast load
+ *             switching.
+ *
+ * NOTE: Most regulators will only support a subset of these modes. Some
+ * will only just support NORMAL.
