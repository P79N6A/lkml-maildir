[About '030 again]
Sorry, missed it; its two cycles for every additional memory access, in
most circumstances.  This is the difference even between an instruction
operating in registers and the same doing it from/to memory, and this is
how longer an instruction takes if it has more instruction words.  It's
true even for 32-bit accesses on the right system (ie. 32-bit memory
bus -- common).
[Just to shortly recap: a multiplication is taking 28/44 cycles at worst,
(16/32 bit), and highly depends on the bit patterns; very roughly about
how much 1 bit is set in the multiplier (not true, just to get the picture)]
