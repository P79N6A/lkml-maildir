Ok, thanks for the help.
Now do I actually need to have the memory mapped in kernel space through
ioremap(), in order to have the memory mapped into user space through
remap_pfn_range()? It seems that remap_pfn_range() only requires a
physical address, not a virtual one.
If this is true then I really don't need to map this in kernel space at
all and only in user space, since it will only be manipulated in user
space.
Thanks,
Jon
