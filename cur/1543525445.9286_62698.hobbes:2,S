Subject: 2.3.43: IDE CD mount(8) hangs; ditto SysRq

I compiled 2.3.43 with gcc-2.95.2, binutils-2.9.5.0.27 on an otherwise
stock Red Hat 6.1 system + updates.
Mounting an IDE CD (after loading the ide-cd and isofs modules by hand
without trouble) hangs the system completely (no mouse, no keyboard, no
disk activity anymore; nothing in the logs). CD stays turned on. Same
happened with 2.3.42aa[23], egcs-1.1.2-24 and gcc-2.95.2.
After echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq (RH puts a 0 there) the system hangs
just as hard. Didn't try that with the aa kernels.
