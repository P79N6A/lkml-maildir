I'm looking for information, either in documentation (!) or
however its available, about the following features in the
2.4.x series kernels:
1. wake-one
2. _syscall4
3. process ID table resizing
Where can I find these documented (no, "the source" isn't a
good answer AFAIAC, even though its true)? Or better, can
anyone answer the following questions about each of these:
A. How do I activate these features? Are they kernel config
   time parameters or standard?
B. How robust is the code implementing these features?
Please feel free to let me know if I have been misled if
#3 isn't an actual feature.
Thanks in advance!
