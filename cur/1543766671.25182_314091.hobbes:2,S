Agreed. If hardware is going to be physically powered down, we need
PMSG_SUSPEND. If it is not (kexec), PMSG_FREEZE should be enough.
Now, if we want separate PMSG_SHUTDOWN. ... I think it is similar
enough to PMSG_SUSPEND that we can keep them same "major" value and
just use different flags. I do not think many drivers will
care.
