On the last couple of Fedora Core 3 test kernels that have been released, 
most recently 2.6.8.1-603 (which I believe is based on 2.6.9-rc BK snapshot) 
I have been seeing an oops when rebooting. I built the kernel myself, with 
the standard config except that IOAPIC on uniprocessor was enabled. This is 
on an Asus P4B533 motherboard (Intel 845 chipset).
The scroll-back feature didn't seem to work and it was too late for the oops 
to be logged, but I did take a picture of the visible part of the crash dump 
which can be viewed here:

Looks like it happened while disabling the IOAPIC..
