I do not think the problem has anything to do with rivafb. I get the same
problem with 2.4.2 when i have dma enabled on my ide disk on my ABIT kt7
which is a via base Athlon mobo as well.
If you have dma enabled , try disabling it and see if the problem goes away
, although now you have a new problem ( slow disk).
