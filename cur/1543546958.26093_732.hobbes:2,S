Building the kernel uses two compilers.  CC is the compiler for actually
building the kernel you are going to boot, and HOSTCC is the compiler for
building auxiliary programs *while you are building the kernel*.
So you don't need to change HOSTCC.
The host side programs compiled with HOSTCC include the configuration
programs and other programs in scripts/, as well as some table generation
programs in places like drivers/char and drivers/sound.
