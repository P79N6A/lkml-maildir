PCI hotplug ? I fergot about that one...
However, maybe even a hotplug aware driver should print out a message
upon initialization telling 'no hardware found'... It could be useful
when you want to know the difference between: 
	* bad driver, use another one
	* good driver, but doesn't recognize/init the hardware because it's buggy.
