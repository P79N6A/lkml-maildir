Hi All,
I found that O_NOFOLLOW is used for opened core file in Linux 2.6.10. 
This means the core file couldn't be a symbolic link. However, I want to 
use symbolic link for core file, So I plan to remove O_NOFOLLOW as 
follows, but I'm not sure there are any impacts introduced by the change?
file = filp_open(corename, O_CREAT | 2 | O_NOFOLLOW | O_LARGEFILE, 0600);
TO
file = filp_open(corename, O_CREAT | 2 /*| O_NOFOLLOW*/ | O_LARGEFILE, 
0600);
Thanks,
Gavin
