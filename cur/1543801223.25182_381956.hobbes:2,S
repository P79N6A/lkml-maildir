Please don't.
I very often work in console (or xterm) and editing kernel code. Files
with lines >80 col. are quite annoying to have to scroll left/right in
and not being able to see the end of lines.
Also, very long lines are annoying to read even if they do fit on your
screen, I can easily fit code lines of 200 chars or more in a GUI
editor in X but IMO readability suffers compared to when that long
line is broken up into a few shorter pieces - less horizontal eye
movement.

Short names can be descriptive too, and long names are not nice to
have to type all the time. Besides, if you need a long description of
a variable or function then use a comment don't try and encode
everything into the name.

Sure, if you name variables like  "int temporary_place_holder" instead
of simply "int tmp" and similar, then 80cols are annoying, but I'd say
the problem there is not the line length limit but the name being
used.
Short and sweet is my preference.

IMHO it's a good rule and we should stick to it.
