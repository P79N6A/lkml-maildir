No, it doesn't. It will detect it as /dev/sda and additionally create a
partition (/dev/sda1) for it).

Well, it depends on what you actually want:
- Raw data in a file inside a partition:
	Mount the filesystem of the partition somewhere and open() the file
- Raw data inside the partition:
	open() the partition (/dev/sda1 in your case); this'll probably
	destroy the filesystem that it contains.
- Raw data directly on the (unpartitioned) device:
	open() the device (/dev/sda) and write to it. That will probably
	kill the partition table as well as the filesystem in this
	partition.
By the way, this isn't really a kernel question, and if it's "urgent",
you'd probably ask your boss to send us some $$ for helping you...
