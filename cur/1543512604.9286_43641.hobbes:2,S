Why not do it both ways? If the BIOS and the kernel disagree, log a
message about the problem to the console, and use the kernel's result.
Since this is a boot-time issue only, the overhead is irrelevant, and
having a message about it will make it easier to debug for those for
whom the kernel's method is incorrect.
