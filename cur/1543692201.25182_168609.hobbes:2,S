Subject: Prefered method to map PCI memory into userspace.

I am looking for the most current (blessed) structure
for mapping PCI memory to a user process. One that allows
both PIO and busmastering to work on a common block of
PCI RAM. I am not concerned with backporting to older
kernels but it would be nice if the solution wasn't ibm specific.
My problem is a 64M window into a frame buffer that I would
like to map into user space. I am more than willing to put
forth the effort, I just want to make sure I'm heading in
the right direction.
Is there a better forum for posting this? Regards,
J. Deas
RH9.0 2.4.20-6smp kernel and above.
