How about debugging a known problem instead of whining how your arch was
broken by a simple change required to consolidate early parameter
parsing sanely?
I suspect that the problem is caused by x86_64 not saving the
commandline correctly, and this change has merely made the bug worse.
You copy the command line to saved_command_line twice: once in head64.c
and once in setup.c.  Why?  In head64.c you don't terminate it, in
setup.c you do.  Which is right?  There are printks of
saved_command_line in head64.c and main.c, what do they say?
I don't have an x86_64 box, and I ask *again* if someone who does can
take a look at the problem...
Rusty.
