Subject: [PATCH 2/2] toshiba - Move Kconfig entry to drivers/char
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/134

The source code for this driver is currently located in drivers/char, and
given that this is not an x86 processor feature, it shouldn't live in the
x86 Kconfig.
So lets move it to the Kconfig for drivers/char instead.
