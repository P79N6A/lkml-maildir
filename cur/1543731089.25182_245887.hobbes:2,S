Why? foo/metas is a file system object just like foo. It has owner,
permission bits, so access to its meta-data should be provided, and
uniform way to provide access to the file system object meta-data is to
have these little magic files inside metas directory, which is a file
system object just like metas. It has owner^@^@^@^@*** - Lisp stack
overflow. RESET
