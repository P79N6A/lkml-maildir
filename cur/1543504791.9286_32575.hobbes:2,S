Hello Im hoping somebody can help on this one. Im trying to increase the number
of connections on a linux box. As far as I am aware (but I could be wrong im
new to this) you can get 128 connections, Im trying to increase this to either,
 512 or 1024. I've gone through socket.h , socketbits.h ,
task.h for the number of processes , sem.h. After that I can't seem to find
anymore information and myt system falls over around 255 connections or 376
255 over tcp/ip connection and 376 local. This is on a 2.2.10 kernel. Anybody
know which files i have missed? ANy help would be greatly appriciated as I've
been banging my head of the desk for a week now =)
cheers
 Stuart
