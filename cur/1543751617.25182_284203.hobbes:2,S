My way simply proves that existing userspace methods have not been
exhausted. It's not impossible as was claimed and cleaner methods or
nicely wrapped variants of the above probably exist. And yes, doing
ugly things in userspace is preferable to adding application-specific
baggage to the kernel.

Feh. The RT scheduling class issue is orthogonal. Addressing mlock and
scheduling class at once (and nothing else) is actually an ugliness of
your LSM approach as there are folks who want mlock and not RT.
