It does (assuming host support), but when I tried to use the normal TSC code 
it poked at other things which a guest couldn't do.
Currently I've hit another issue, but revisiting this is on my TODO.  The 
cpu_has_tsc panic is overzealous, since we deal without it, but it'd be nice 
to use the common TSC clock code.
Thanks,
Rusty.
