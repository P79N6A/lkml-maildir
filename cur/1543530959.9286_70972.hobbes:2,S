Thanks for the patch (powerful open source, yeah!)...
Although "not perfect", it helps a lot by making a good policy for
the ports allocated.
Anyway something must be done to other ip_masq_xxx helper modules as well.
There's no possible connection track in 2.2 (go for 2.4+netfilter), but
we could constraint creation of back-tunnels to (eg.):
     1)  ms->state == IP_MASQ_S_ESTABLISHED
     2)  certain magic  rate (hoping that this can be shaped per application
        module).
1) is certainly fast doable, I'll make a patch ...
