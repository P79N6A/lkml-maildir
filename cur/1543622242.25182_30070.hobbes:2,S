There are places to learn how to do basic programming and this isn't it.
There is no way that the kernel list can handle every bad idea over and
over again in a kind and gentle way.  Doing so requires so much time that
noone would ever get any real work done.  At some point, you just say
no.  If we didn't, we'd still be arguing about STREAMS, redoing the kernel
in C++, etc.
