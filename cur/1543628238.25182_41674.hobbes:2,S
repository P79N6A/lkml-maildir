We have hourly snapshots, thanks to the work David Woodhouse and
Rik van Riel did at a moments notice.  Does this satisfy your
concerns above?
I have a suspicion that the problem of conflicting obvious fixes
won't go away.
There's another interesting twist here... - I didn't see any of them on

I'm a BK user!  GNU patches are being submitted behind my back without
discussion on linux-kernel.  I'm going to remove the SubmittingPatches
document!  It's harming discussion of patches on linux-kernel.
