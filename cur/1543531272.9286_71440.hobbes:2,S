Is it possible to use a standard SCSI host adapter to fake other SCSI
devices on the same bus (for example, an additional hard disk with a
SCSI ID different from that of the host adapter)?  If the answer is yes,
can I use the current "generic" user-space SCSI interface for that?
(This sounds crazy, I know, but I think I'd have an interesting
application for this stuff...)
