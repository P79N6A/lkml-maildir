Please always generate diffs against the latest kernel!  I changed the
patch to reflect the new location of ppc64's machine_kexec.c.
In that file, I notice that this comment has become more informative:
/*
 * Provide a dummy crash_notes definition until crash dump is implemented.
 * This prevents breakage of crash_notes attribute in kernel/ksysfs.c.
 */
note_buf_t crash_notes[NR_CPUS];
Please check that with your new implementation, the above "breakage"
(whatever it was) remains fixed.
