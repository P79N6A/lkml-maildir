Hi,
Thanks to your reply erlier. I successfult compiled my device driver separatly 
as module.o and then ran a script to insmod into the kernel.
I have another basic question.
I have two PC systems. First one acts as my development system which I 
develope code using KDevelop running Red Hat linux (2.4.18). When I compile 
my application code (say app.0) and my device driver code (say module.o) then 
I FTP these files into my target system which is a scalled down single-board 
computer (with minimal RAM and disk) which runs linux 2.2.20.
Most of the time everything is O.K. However, when it comes to the device 
driver module (module.o), I get some kernel mismatch problems (obvisouly).
E.g. the file_operations struct in 2.2.20 is different to 2.4.18
My question is: How can I tell gcc or even within the module itself (e.g. 
KERNEL_VERSION) to compile for lower version kernel (i.e tell kernel 2.4.18 
to compile for 2.2.20)
Regards
