i got the patch for NAPI,and patched it on linux2.4.18. it worked. the throughput of 128bytes frame improve from 60% to more than 90%. it seems that it has no influnce to frames bigger than 256.
but there is still some problem. when i tested the throught of 64bytes frame,some error occured. in the begining it works well. but after several times of try the linux router can not receive any packets at all.(i found that by run ifconfig when the smartbits is testing). for the other frames it worked very well.
so what's wrong with my test? is there some problem with the patch?

chuanbo zheng
