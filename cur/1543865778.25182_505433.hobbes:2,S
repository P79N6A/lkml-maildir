Subject: [PATCH][2/5] floppy.c: Remove pointless register keywords
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch removes the use of the 'register' keyword from floppy.c
Marking some variables 'register' may have made sense in the past (though I 
doubt it for these ones), but these days I very much suspect that we would 
rather grant gcc more freedom in how to handle the variables and I doubt 
very much that in this day and age optimizing access to variables via 
'register' makes any sense for a floppy driver.  Let's just get rid of it.
