I found myself making that same error, saying 'nodes_intersect' instead
of 'nodes_intersects' the other day.  And I might be the one who invented
that name ;).
This would probably be too noisey and too little gain to do on the
Linux kernel, but if this was just a little private project of my own,
I'd be running a script over the whole thing, modifying all 30 or so
instances of bitmap_intersects, cpus_intersects and nodes_intersects so
as to remove the final 's' character.
