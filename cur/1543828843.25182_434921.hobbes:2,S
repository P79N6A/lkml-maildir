Hi Eric.  Unfortunately, I've only received [0/25] so far, depsite both
being on the cc list and on linux-pci.  I'm getting all the replies
though, so I'm hopeful I'll receive the original posts soon.
Did you look at the parisc scheme?  We have a fixed area for CPU
interrupts and then an area for dynamic interrupt assignment.  Since
devices are typically discovered in the same order between boots, the
interrupt number doesn't end up varying between boots.
