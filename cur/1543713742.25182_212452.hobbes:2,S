Well ... it doesn't "require" 700 bytes of code.  But it is currently
consuming that much in this patch set, each time a for node loop is
invoked.
This is because "for_each_online_node" boils down to two copies of
"find_next_bit" (to get the first bit and then to get the next bit), and
in the file include/asm-ia64/bitops.h, find_next_bit() is the following
hefty chunk of inline code:
/*
 * Find next bit in a bitmap reasonably efficiently..
 */
static inline int
find_next_bit(const void *addr, unsigned long size, unsigned long offset)
{
        unsigned long *p = ((unsigned long *) addr) + (offset >> 6);
        unsigned long result = offset & ~63UL;
        unsigned long tmp;
        if (offset >= size)
                return size;
        size -= result;
        offset &= 63UL;
        if (offset) {
                tmp = *(p++);
                tmp &= ~0UL << offset;
                if (size < 64)
                        goto found_first;
                if (tmp)
                        goto found_middle;
                size -= 64;
                result += 64;
        }
        while (size & ~63UL) {
                if ((tmp = *(p++)))
                        goto found_middle;
                result += 64;
                size -= 64;
        }
        if (!size)
                return result;
        tmp = *p;
  found_first:
        tmp &= ~0UL >> (64-size);
        if (tmp == 0UL)         /* Are any bits set? */
                return result + size; /* Nope. */
  found_middle:
        return result + __ffs(tmp);
}

Some things that Matthew might want to try:
 1) Don't inline ia64 find_next_bit
 2) Hunt down and minimize uses find_next_bit (benefits more than just numamask)
 3) Instead of having the loop macro evaluate to:
	for (i = first_node(mask);  i < MAX_NUMNODES;  i = next_node(i, mask))
    rather have it evaluate something like this (node_set is more efficient):
	for (
	      ({ i = 0; while(!node_set(i, mask) && i < MAX_NUMNODES) i++; i; });
	      i < MAX_NUMNODES; 
	      ({ i++; while(!node_set(i, mask) && i < MAX_NUMNODES) i++; i; })
	)
Hmmm ... (3) looks rather nice (in an ugly sort of way ...).  It might be
worth moving lower, perhaps into bitmap, for use by both cpumask and
nodemask.
