Subject: [PATCH -mm] mpt fusion: Shut up uninitialized variable warnings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/2/185

drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c: In function ‘mptctl_mpt_command’:
drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c:1764: warning: ‘bufIn.len’ may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c:1765: warning: ‘bufOut.len’ may be used uninitialized in this function
come because gcc gets confused by some "goto" statements in above function.
The warnings have been verified to be bogus, however, the function does
initialize these later (after the offending goto's) in the function anyway.
So let's move those initializations to top of function, thereby also shutting
up these warnings.
