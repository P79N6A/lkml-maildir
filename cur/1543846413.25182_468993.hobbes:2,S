I'm certain these people already experience breakage when using new bits
that haven't been settled into their desktop/distro of choice.  It
wasn't so long ago (2.6.10 - 2.6.13) that installing a new kernel would
break the expectations of udev, HAL, and libsysfs while sysfs directory
structure was getting laid out for stuff like power management, wireless
devices, etc.  If you're a core system developer, you've got to expect
breakage somewhere.

I'd point out here that one is not breaking the _distro_, as long as we
assume that distros are internally consistent (which one of the major
points of a distro!).  What's getting broken is people who
install/replace distro-provided software with their own bits.  In the
first case, the distro people are responsible to making sure that
breakage does not occur, and that distro users are not affected.  In the
second case, that responsibility falls to the user who
installed/replaced the distro-provided software, precisely because that
software is no longer distro provided.
We've _got_ to accept that somebody installing their own stuff has
_some_ responsibility to ensure compatibility of the random code they
install.  In a perfect world, distros never make a mistake.  But usually
a distro has a much broader and deeper set of expertise than any one
person, and is at least peripherally aware of changes coming down the
pike.  One single person cannot hope to assume the responsibilities of
many maintainers working by division of labor.
Obviously we don't try to break stuff unintentionally, or when the pain
would be too severe, because we know better than most what's going on
and it's Just Not Nice.  But ultimately, whoever is installing the
software bears the consequences of his/her actions, precisely because
they pulled the trigger.

Yes, nl80211/cfg80211 (sent to netdev@ last week) is the likely
successor.  Please, if you have suggestions for ABI/API-proofability,
review the patch and post suggestions!  We all know a carefully designed
is not just about the code, but about the semantics, structures, etc as
well.  It would be quite valuable to have everyone's input to make sure
it's as future-proof as possible.
