Frankly, I think Intel is misinterpreting how strict the FCC is being
(or maybe the FCC is being too strict).  I would interpret their
mandates as meaning that, as purchased, equipment can't transmit on
unauthorized frequencies, and that it's not "user-modifiable".  User
modification doesn't include things like opening the case of a toy
walkie-talkie up and swapping out a crystal, nor does it include things
like opening up the firmware or driver for something and messing with
it.
Frankly, I'm annoyed that, if Intel understood the full extent of the
problem, that they didn't take a better approach and simply give the
card a set of legal values.  It doesn't need to understand the
subtleties of what they mean.  It just needs to know frequencies 1, 2,
and 3 are okay, but not 4, 5, and 6, and that the max power is xx dBm.
OTOH, I'd love to get one of these cards and play with it.  I'd love a
WiFi card that can run up to 5 or 10 watts.  (1500 is a little much, and
my laptop's battery can't supply it :-)
