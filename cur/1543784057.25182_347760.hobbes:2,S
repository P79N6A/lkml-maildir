The attached device-driver allocates a 0x4000 length
stack in an ioctl() procedure, uses that stack, then
returns to the old stack before returning from the
ioctl(). Since the data-space for the stack is allocated
only once (when the module is installed), the runtime
overhead is not very great. The driver runs on 2.6.13.
This just shows that it can be done! This doesn't mean
that one should actually do this!
