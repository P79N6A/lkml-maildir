I took a very short look and what spring to mind first is that the
device probing/remoal is rather bogus.  The ->probe/->remove callbacks
of a PCI driver can be called at any time, and any initialization /
teardown actions must happen from those.  A logical consequence of that
is that a proper PCI driver should have no global state.
I'd also like to second Matthews commens, please move the driver to
drivers/serial and use proper readX/writeX accessors.  Please run the
driver through sparse to find the iomem derferences and possibly other
issues.
