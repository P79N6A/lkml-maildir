Well, I would think some here would be interested in samba performance.   
However, If 4-way P4 systems are considered rare at this point I guess it's 
not important enough to revert.  FYI, after testing 2P with and without 
hyperthreading, it's much faster.  481 Mbps for no hyperthreading and 605 
Mbps with.  If I can get even close to that improvement with 4 processors, 
I'll be very happy.
