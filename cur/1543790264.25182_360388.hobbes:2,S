Have mercy.  I currently have twelve patches which alter arch/i386/Kconfig
and this patch conflicts with most of them.  This shouldn't come as a
surprise - Kconfig files are oft-patched, and this is x86.
What I did was to simply copy the large block between
	if !X86_ELAN
and
	config X86_OOSTORE
over into Kconfig.cpu, taking the modifications with it.
As long as that's also what you did things should work OK.  If you actually
made any changes as you did the copy-and-paste, we're screwed.
