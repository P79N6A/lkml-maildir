Andrew, can you please push this Calgary bug-fix to 2.6.23 in your
next merge? it fixes a showstopper bug in the recently merged CalIOC2
support that hits machines with multiple levels of PCI-to-PCI bridges.
Thanks,
Muli

Subject: x86-64: Calgary - Fix mis-handled PCI topology
Current code assumed that devices were directly connected to a Calgary
bridge, as it tried to get the iommu table directly from the parent bus 
controller.
When we have another bridge between the Calgary/CalIOC2 bridge and the 
device we should look upwards until we get to the top (Calgary/CalIOC2 
bridge), where the iommu table resides.
