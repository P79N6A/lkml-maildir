Thanks for the prodding. I've sent to Alan Advansys SCSI driver
3.3G patches against 2.4.2 + ac24 and for 2.2.19. The driver can
be gotten from:
http://www.turbolinux.com.cn/~bfrey/advansys-33G.tgz
http://www.turbolinux.com.cn/~bfrey/advansys-33G.tgz-MD5SUM
Andy at www.connectcom.net, www.advansys.com has been busy,
but I'm sure will soon update the www, ftp sites.
