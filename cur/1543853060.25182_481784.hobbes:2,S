You are getting the same message
ata_piix 0000:00:1f.2: MAP [ P0 P1 IDE IDE ]
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.2[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 17

ata_piix: probe of 0000:00:1f.2 failed with error -16
But, your drives are driven by the sata_sil driver, which seems to be ok.
See your partition tables displayed below.

VFS: Cannot open root device "821" or unknown-block(8,33)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
unknown-block(8,33)
Your root device seems to be wrong. Append the correct root=/dev/sda1 if it is
this partition.
Anyway, the first message indicates the same trouble as mine when trying to
reserve the I/O ports.
