I have exactly this (these messages) but then with a amd/via ata driver
on tyan/amd motherboard with an IBM/Hitachi harddisk.
It looks like the drive cpu locks up every now and then, notably when
the environmental temperature and/or the drive's temperature are high
and there is much activity on the drive.
A reset (either from the driver or manually using hdparm) helps
(temporarily).
I was going to buy new drives for this fact (from another brand) but it
looks that won't necessarily mean my problem will be solved :-(
BTW I have another, exactly identical harddisk in the same computer
(well, ok, 1 year younger) and that one doesn't show the problem. 
BTW2 could it be that somewhere a timeout has been lowered in recent
kernels? That must have been pre-2.6.11 then.
