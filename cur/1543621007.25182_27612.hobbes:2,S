   Not sure if this was the same message I received. but here
   is the patch I used to get around my sound problem in
   2.5.4.
   Linus, please apply to 2.5.5 pre1
Umm, I don't it is safe to assume that only ISA sound drivers end up
making use of this code.  I would like you to prove that before
submitting this change.
