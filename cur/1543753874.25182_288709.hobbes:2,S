Ahem, that would be the one wiping out entire input system...

1. Try compiling psmouse as a module and not load it until keyboard
driver (atkbd) is loaded.
2. Try kernel 2.6.8.1 - it looks like changes in 2.6.9-rc2-bk3 are
causing trouble on some systems but I can't figure out the reason.
Also, if you change undef DEBUG to #define DEBUG in
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c, reboot with log_buf_size=131072 and send
me the full dmesg or kernel log I'd appreciate it.
Thanks!
