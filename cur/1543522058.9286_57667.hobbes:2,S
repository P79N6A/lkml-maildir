If at this point the timer pointed by "timer" gets detached while "fn" is
running, at the next loop the machine is going to fail. I am sorry.

Please don't use the two timer_bh patches quoted above (neither the -2
optimized version). Having the timer robust against buggy users is not
necessary but only desiderable, so actually you don't need it.
Nevertheless I'll fix the problem soon.
FYI: the delack-timer-3 patch here:

seems to fix the wait_on_bh popular deadlock on UP/SMP webservers fine :).
