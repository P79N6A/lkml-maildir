Correct. That was the idea.

We needed this patch in 2006 because the AIM9 creat-clo test showed
regressions after the rcu free was put in (discovered during SLES11
verification cycle). All slab allocators do at least defer frees until all
objects in the page are freed if not longer.

Run AIM9 creat-close tests....

Well the issue becomes more severe as accesses to cold memory become more
extensive. Thanks for your work on this.
