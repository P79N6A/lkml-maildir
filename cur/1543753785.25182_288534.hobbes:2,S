We ran into a big problem with this on x86-64. The SUSE installer
would load the floppy driver during installation. Floppy driver would
try to allocate some pages with GFP_DMA and on a small memory x86-64
system (256-512MB) the OOM killer would always start to kill things
trying to free some DMA pages. This was quite a show stopper
because you effectively couldn't install.
So at least for GFP_DMA it seems to be definitely needed.
