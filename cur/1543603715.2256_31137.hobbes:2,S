Am currently getting the following errors in dmesg:

and, after about 24hrs, the box seizes upon me requireing a reboot. The
kernel I'm using is 2.2.19 with raid0.9 and the latest sym* drivers (ie
not the ones that come with the kernel).
The main thing here is that I'm not sure if this is a h/w or s/w issue. Would
msgs like the above be due to the driver, the onboard scsi card or the HD?
Or am I asking the wrong questions? :)
There are other errors usually reported also and they deal with the 1st
SCA drive (with 1 or 2 of the 3rd drive). There are currently 3 SCA drives
on the first controller and 4 LVD drives (external array) on the 2nd. No
hotswapping is being done and there have been no errors reported re the
4 LVD drives as far as I know.
Anyone able to help?
