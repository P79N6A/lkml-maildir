Document huge memory/cache overhead of memory controller in Kconfig
I was a little surprised that 2.6.25-rc* increased struct page for the memory
controller.  At least on many x86-64 machines it will not fit into a single
cache line now anymore and also costs considerable amounts of RAM. 
At earlier review I remembered asking for a external data structure for this.
It's also quite unobvious that a innocent looking Kconfig option with a 
single line Kconfig description has such a negative effect.
This patch attempts to document these disadvantages at least so that users
configuring their kernel can make a informed decision.
