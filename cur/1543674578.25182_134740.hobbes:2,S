Kernel 2.4.20 contains a bug in conntrack (memory-corruption) that can
be triggered when using conntrack helpers. It's fixed in 2.4.21-rc2 so I
suggest you try that. The crashes you see might be the result of this
bug, or maybe not.
I suggest you send this report to linux-net@vger.kernel.org and ask if
it looks like a real bug or if it's memory-corruption.
But you really should upgrade your kernel.
