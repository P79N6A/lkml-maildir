It doesn't need to, the value is correct.

No it doesn't. It's just:
	#define DNAME_INLINE_LEN (sizeof(struct dentry)-offsetof(struct dentry,d_iname))
which is always right. 
It used to assume the padding because of the "____cacheline_aligned" on 
the struct dentry, which obviously also padded out the "sizeof()". But 
since I removed that, DNAME_INLINE_LEN is still correct.
NOTE! It's absolutely true that DNAME_INLINE_LEN may still be different 
from DNAME_INLINE_LEN_MIN. In particular, if something inside the struct 
makes the alignment of "struct dentry" be bigger than the offset of the 
last field, then DNAME_INLINE_LEN will be different from (bigger than) 
DNAME_INLINE_LEN.
It's just that with current architectures, I don't believe that will 
happen in practice. But I left it as-is, because at least in theory it 
could happen.
