Hey all,
I know the physical address of a string which is loaded into flash memory. I
want to read the string at the known physical memory location from within a
kernel module. I initially tried reading the "/dev/mem" file using open(),
lseek() and read(). But I guess its not possible to call these functions from a
kernel module.
Is there some way of reading the contents of this physical memory location from
within a kernel module?
Thank You
Veena
