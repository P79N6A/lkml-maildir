 I recall the threads you mention.
 I also recall at least a half dozen regular contributors agreeing
 that splitting up Configure.help was the way forward.

 This is something I never understood. CML1 has served us for
 10 years or so, and suddenly its declared "unfixable".
 "I'm not hacking that, I'll fix it in CML2" seemed to become
 the attitude. End result ? Linus got pissed off with your
 complaints of non-inclusion, and _fixed_ one of the CML1 problems
 (Configure.help) And how long did it take ? ISTR it was around
 an hour after his first mail was sent to you, me & Jeff.
 1 hour. Versus the year you spent procrastinating about how
 CML2 would fix it.
 Sure CML2 fixes some bits that are not easily fixed in CML1,
 but I wonder sometimes how much of it is/was fixable.
