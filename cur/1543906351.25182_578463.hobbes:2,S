Wait, you forget that something may change the name. That dmesg message
from 1 second ago does not need to be valid anymore, just as anything
else in this world.

I think it once did with suse, but it does not right now. Worth fixing
(yet I am no udev maintainer).

So blame your distro for not integrating udev correctly with dhcp-client.
I can only speak for suse, where you define BOOTPROTO=dhcp for an
interface. Then, on /etc/init.d/network, every interface that has a
configuration file gets run, so you never see what ethX udev picked for
the day, but things still work. That's good^TM.
