A few questions:
- If I receive an Aegis changeset, how do I contextually eyeball
  its effects on the current repository?  This is clearly
  something the kernel maintainers wish to do quickly and easily.
- Is there support for forward branching? (right term?).  Where a
  patch to a branched earlier release can be fed forward into
  the current.  The Linux kernel isn't big/complex enough to
  need this, but it's nice for other stuff.
- If a change set has been committed to the main repository
  is it possible (easy) to see each of the individual changes
  which made up that changeset?
  If so, can a single one of those be backed out?
- How does it implement the three-way merge?  And what's your
  experience with the 3way merge? Does it work?  I've always
  felt they're a bit scary.
Thanks.
