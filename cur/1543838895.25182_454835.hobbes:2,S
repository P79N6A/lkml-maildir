yes, it is possible to use hierarchical beancounters.
kernel memory, user memory and TCP/IP buffers are accounted hierarchicaly.
user interface for this is not provided yet as it would complicate patchset

every patch which adds a resource modifies this function and sets
some default limit. Check: [PATCH 5/7] UBC: kernel memory accounting (core)
