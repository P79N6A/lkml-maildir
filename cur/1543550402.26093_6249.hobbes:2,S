`__set_current_state(x)' is completly equivalent to `current->state = x'.
set_current_state(x) instead means:
	current->state = x
	mb()
It puts a CPU memory barrier _after_ the assignment. This is necessary in most
cases while using the wait-event interface to avoid SMP races.
In short you need set_current_state(x) when you do something that relies on the
ordering like:
	set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)
	if (event_happened_meanwhile)
		break;
	schedule();
You must make sure not to read `event_happened_meanwhile' before making visible
the change of current->state to avoid missing one event and to hang in
UNINTERRUPTIBLE mode in schedule.
You don't need the mb() version (so you can use __set_current_state(x)) when
you do something that doesn't relies on the ordering like:
	[..]
	remove_wait_queue(...);
	__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
	return;
In the l-k archives you should find further details of such SMP race conditions.
