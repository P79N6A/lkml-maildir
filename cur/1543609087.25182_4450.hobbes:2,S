On XFS the DMAPI event mask for that file is kept in a field in the
xfs_dinode_core_t structure--so it's in the inode.  On Irix, HSM's store state
info in an extended attribute in the "root" namespace on each file, but they
do it via the appropriate DMAPI calls (which jump to XFS's extended attribute
code) rather than via the extended attribute library.
