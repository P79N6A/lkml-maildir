What kernel did you have before?
What you see is the same I am experiencing on every boot - when the sound
module is loaded, udev loads the previous volume settings. The volume settings
are normal for me, but I guess the instant jump from 0-70% (for Master) and
0-61% (for PCM) is not taken too heartly by the soundcard.
