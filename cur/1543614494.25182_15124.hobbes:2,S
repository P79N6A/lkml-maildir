In the "Linux Device Drivers" book, the author writes quite a lot of
drivers for virtual devices that actually rely on the ability to return
short writes in many cases. Many of the standard UNIX utilities rely on
just the same behaviour as well.

...which ought to look like this code...
	open(file)
	ptr = fillbuffer(100k)
	endptr = ptr + 100k
	while (ptr < endptr) {
		result += write(ptr, endptr - ptr)
		if (result > 0)
			ptr += result
		else
			ERROR
	}
	close(file)
...as anything else is just plain buggy and can't be otherwise.

It's also not exactly hard to do the right thing - there's little extra
in the revised code snippet to the original one.

Precicely why that sort of code is so essential.
Best wishes from Riley.
