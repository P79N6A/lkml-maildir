Well, on the one hand, since the driver is only being maintained we should not
remove code that works. Also, i don't know how many users ide-tape really has
but, would it be worth the trouble at all? Because if nobody's using it, we
could just as well pipe the whole thing into /dev/null.. On the other hand, the
pipelining part _is_ kinda big and, right, it is not that straightfoward to
look at it and know what it actually does - it truly is a student project :)

Well, it appeared in my lkml mailbox having gone over vger which means at least
somebody got it :). But, yeah, that was a real nightmare yesterday sending all
those patches in one go. See, i got a stupid umts modem behind a not so transparent
proxy :) whose subnet is listed in almost every spam database on the planet
and whenever i try to send more than one mail i hit all sorts of mail server
restrictions like yahoo's maximum messages per day crap.. Gmail seems a bit
smarter ?! and scans the mail message and then says all kinds of funny stuff :):

what's next, probably something like:

Anyway, resending #23 to you in a private mail.
