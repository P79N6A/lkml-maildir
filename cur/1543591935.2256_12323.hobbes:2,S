I was getting the file ias9i_linux.tar from
http://xxx
:yyy@download-east.oracle.com/otn/linux/ias/9ias/ias9i_linux.tar
(username and password masked to protect the innocent) and decided to take
a peek at the contents of that (huge) file, using "tar xfv ias9i_linux.tar".
After a few moments, wget segfaulted. I tried to continue the download, using
wget -c yada yada yada, and it locks up, becoming an unkillable process (i.e.
I had to reboot to get rid of the thing). I could reproduce this with another
downloader, who gave me this error:
setting resume on existing file `ias9i_linux.tar' at 1087947248 bytes

This seems to be a bug in the kernel, maybe because the file is too big,
and VFAT partitions don't like that. I don't have any other operating
systems here I can test this on, but I could try installing FreeBSD or
downgrading the kernel to 2.2.19 (I'm running 2.4.4) to attempt to trigger
this bug again. But, I'd like to ask some knowledgeable person to take a
look at that error above to tell me what the hell is going on. I get a
similar error when I strace wget (since this one doesn't give any weird
errors, just locks up).
Please Cc: to me, I'm not subscribed to this list atm.
Thank you,
Carlos.
