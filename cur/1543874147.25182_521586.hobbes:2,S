It is the same problem: if dst->neighbour holds neighbour, it should
not hold device. parms->dev is not supposed to be used after
neigh_parms_release(). F.e. set parms->dev to NULL to catch bad references.
Do you search for a way to find real inifiniband device in
ipoib_neigh_destructor()? I guess you will not be able.
The problem is logical: if destructor needs device, neighbour entry
_somehow_ have to hold reference to the device (via neigh->dev, neigh->parms,
whatever). Hence, if we hold neighbour entry, unregister cannot be completed.
Therefore, destructor cannot refer to device. Q.E.D. :-)
Seems, releasing dst->neighbour is inevitable.
