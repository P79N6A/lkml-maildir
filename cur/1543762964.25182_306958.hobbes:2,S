CFQ with io contexts is relatively new, only there since 2.6.10 or so.
On UP, we don't grab the queue lock effetively so the problem isn't seen
there.
You can work around this issue by using a different default io scheduler
at boot time, and then select cfq for your ide hard drive when the
system has booted with:
# echo cfq > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler
(substitute hda for any other solid storage device).
