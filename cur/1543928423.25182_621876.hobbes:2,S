Yes, why do we not come back from schedule?
If we are not allowed to schedule after setting PF_EXITING before
we set TASK_DEAD that entire code path sounds brittle and
error prone.

It should.  I think the reaping is just an optimization.  Because we
know we will never need those dentries again, and we can pin them by
open directories or opening files.  What I don't know off the top of
my head is if there is a d_drop equivalent going on that might be a
problem if we don't address it.
