No, 0x40 is an illegal vector error. It's a (semi-) known quirk in the P6 family
of processors that you get this error when writing a null vector to any of the
LVT entries, even if you are also setting the mask bit at the same time.
Both the clear_local_APIC() call at PM suspend and the reinitialisation at PM
resume can trigger this.
The "error" is mostly harmless. Ignore it for now, I'll do a patch to silence it later.
