That's a pure driver function, and we didn't implement it because we
emulate synaptics. I think your erratically moving thing might be caused
by a relayout of the order, maybe you should try to observe the
interrupt transfers the device gives you in a systematic way like I did
with my python scripts? Those display the levels of each byte. Maybe
they changed to transmitting not bytes but words for each level?
