Well, I made one pass at that, and blew it up with a 2 pound block of C4.  
I know just enough about C to be dangerous, and my real C knowledge is 
pretty much K&R.
As for the large trout, them are definitely on the hard to find list here 
in WV.  Now if I still lived in Rapid City S.D., this time of the year is 
a great time to pick up the odd old hook nosed Brown Trout that might go 
as high as 8 or 9 pounds and take up 30+ inches laying on your yardstick.  
I had 2 such on my stringer about 40 years ago one late April day but 
they got to fighting it, broke it and got away.  I thought my wife, in 
the other end of the boat, was going to throw me overboard to retrieve 
them, but I don't swim well, don't even float, and the nearest solid 
earth was 170 feet away, straight down...  Fortunately for me she didn't.  
Unfortunately, she had a stroke and died a year later, at age 34.  I 
still miss her, she was what you would call a good woman.
