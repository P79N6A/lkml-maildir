Same for OpenBSD.   The CVS commit list is public. You can find the changes,
and the rationale, and you can discuss them up for people responsible for
them.
and it's very easy to join in, as long as you can write code that works...
It's actually *easier* to follow than linux development, since you *don't*
have to hang up on dozen places to find out what's going.
BTW, puttint Kernel nazis/LinBSD in the subject line is a very poor joke...
This is a somewhat public list, and there are lots of people hanging around.
If you like that bazaar-style so much, why trying to offend/drive away
BSD developpers ?
