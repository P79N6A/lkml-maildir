There is only one reason I know for reverse page tables. That is ARM2/ARM3 
support - which is still not fully merged because of this issue
The MMU on these systems is a CAM, and the mmu table is thus backwards to
convention. (It also means you can notionally map two physical addresses to
one virtual but thats undefined in the implementation ;))
