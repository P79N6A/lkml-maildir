No no no. This is not what is needed. You see, we do have to
set exec_bc as temporary (and atomic) context. Having temporary
context is 1. flexible 2. needed by beancounters' network accountig.
We have to track this particular scenario.
Moreover making get_exec_bc() as
if (in_interrupt())
	return &irq_bc;
else
	return current->exec_bc;
is awful. It must me simple and stupid to allow us making temporary
contexts in any place of code.
Maybe we can make smth similar to wait_task_inactive and change
it's beancounter before unlocking the runqueue?
