Well, batched signal delivery is apparently required feature,
when signals are queued. There are no questions here.
But do not forget that even generation of such signals is not a zero
overhead, which can be saved as rule. F.e. both old and rt signals
are not generated at all when someone _sleeps_ in read()/write().
From the viewpoint of previous mails, it is bug. Look, another
signal may wake us, then read() returns partial read. Oops, event is lost.
