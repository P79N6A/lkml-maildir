Well, that's some good news, at least.

OK, it looks like the period is limited to 25ns.  Could you confirm
this?
cat /sys/class/spi_transport/target0:0:0/period
cat /sys/class/spi_transport/target0:0:0/max_period
Now, if the max_period is 25, try doing
echo 12.5 > /sys/class/spi_transport/target0:0:0/max_period
and then
echo 1 > /sys/class/spi_transport/target0:0:0/revalidate
to trigger a revalidation of the domain and see if it comes up to 160.
Thanks,
James
