Subject: [PATCH x/16] LTTng : Linux Trace Toolkit Next Generation 0.5.95, kernel 2.6.17

Hi,
Following my presentation "The LTTng Tracer : a low impact performance and
behavior monitor for GNU/Linux" at OLS2006, I think the interest shown by the
community for the LTTng tracer makes it worthy to be announced to LKML so it canbenefit from your input and be eventually mainlined.
Through the discussion some of us had at OLS this year, the emergence of many
ad-hoc tracing tools (RT-preempt latency tracer, Block I/O subsystem tracer)
and of many tracing projects (SystemTAP, LKST, KFT, LTTng) shows the need for
a solid tracing infrastructure, which has been the focus of my work.
The LTTng core fulfills primarily the following goals :
- Serializing information in event records
- Serializing event records
- Must be trivial to use by subsystem maintainers
  - Usable from any execution context
- Relatively simple, minimum side effect
- Identity of the event record
- Flexible types in the event record
- Tracing control mechanism
The project is described in my paper, available in the OLS2006 proceedings or atthe following URL : 
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/papers/desnoyers-ols2006.pdf.
 More
information is available at 
http://ltt.polymtl.ca
 (see the QUICKSTART guide to
learn how to have the complete set of tools ready to be used).
I hope such an infrastructure will incite kernel developers to instrument
their own subsystem.
