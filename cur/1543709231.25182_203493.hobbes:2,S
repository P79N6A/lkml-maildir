It's clear from the trace: we're doing down_read() inside
sync_sb_inodes()'s inode_lock.
Yes, a trylock would fix it up, but it's a bit sleazy.
And we might have another problem here: we're thnking about removing the
global plugging queue and switching disk plugging over to being a
per-address_space thing.  So blk_run_queues() goes away and is replaced with
	mapping->backing_dev_info.unplug(&mapping->backing_dev_info);
so we only unplug the queues which back the relevant address_space.
The top-level code will take the top-level queue's lock, and the
devicemapper's implementation of backing_dev_info.unplug() will be called
under the top-level queue lock and will need to perform the same
devicemapper table walk.  A trylock here will not be acceptable: if it
fails, a process hangs up for seconds or even minutes.
So for two reasons now, it's looking like that semaphore which protects the
devicemapper tables needs to become a spinlock.  One which has interesting
ranking properties.
