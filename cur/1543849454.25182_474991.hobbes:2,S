Yes, the code was not really doing what I actually intended. (It was working,
but the range always started at vaddr).
I am using randomize_range (PAGE_SIZE, ELF_ET_DYN_BASE,0) (- vaddr) now
after further comments from Arjan.
Any other good ideas for a range to do the randomization in are welcome.
Ciao, Marcus
