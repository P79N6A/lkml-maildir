<nitpick>
Since netif_carrier_ok already has a "!" in it, it is guaranteed to 
return a 0 / 1 result. so this could be:
  	return sprintf(buf, dec_fmt, netif_carrier_ok(dev));
Of course your way is more robust to future 'netif_carrier_ok' changes 
and the compiler should optimize it way anyway since it is an inline 
function, so I actually prefer the !! version :)
</nitpick>
