I don't think this needs to be cleaned up before merge.  I've spent
an hour or two looking at it, and while we can do a somewhat better
job as part of the generic mutex framework, it's quite tricky (due to
the different <asm/mutex.h> implementations).  It has the potential to
introduce some hard-to-hit bugs in the generic mutexes, and there's some
API discussions to have.
It's no worse than XFS (which still has its own implementation of
'synchronisation variables', a (very thin) wrapper around mutexes, a
(thin) wrapper around rwsems, and wrappers around kmalloc and kmem_cache.

Later.  It's still there for XFS.

No urgency here.

I wonder if Michael Kerrisk has time to help with that.  Cc'd.

This does need auditing.

Nice to have, but generally not required.

Agreed on these two.

Can be fixed up later.

Ditto.
