vmalloc, vmap, etc. always put a guard page after the allocation. So
if you test string operations on vmalloc()'ed memory, you have
unmapped pages in both ends.
I like the idea of a test suite for kernel internals, but I also think
it would be best to run it in kernel mode since things like atomics,
etc. may work differently in user space on some architectures.
