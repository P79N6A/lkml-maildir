At the moment unless anyone gets upset I expect to obsolete the CMD640
but nothing else PCI. Can't comment on non x86 drivers and that may be up
to port maintainers, and in part to polishing the core code to handle it
better.
Some vendors are trialling a libata switch in their upcoming
distributions and the only barrier I expect to need some quick fixing is
the HPA support.
