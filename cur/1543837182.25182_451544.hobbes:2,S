Recently modpost has been enhanced to do section reference checks.
So modpost is used to check that there is no references from .text to
.init.text - the latter will be freed by the kernel so we better avoid
it.
The consistency checks does a bit more than just that simple check but
this was enough reason to run it twice in the build process.
