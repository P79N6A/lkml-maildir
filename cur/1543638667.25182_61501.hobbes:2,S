Why 10 ?
    unsigned long k32= ~0;
    unsigned long long k64 = ~0;
    printf("%d %lu\n",sizeof(k32)*8,k32);
    printf("%d %llu\n",sizeof(k64)*8,k64);
gives
32 4294967295
64 18446744073709551615
On a 64 bit box you could have 2^64 bytes.
Opps, and on a 32bit box you could have 16Gb of swap ?
1Tb is:
    unsigned long long k64 = 1ULL<<40;
64 1099511627776
13 digits (nice number ;))
Sorry, late at night here...
