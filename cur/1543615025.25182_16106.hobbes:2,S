Well I don't know diddly about the prefetch instruction, but.

This needs to be inside ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH.  Otherwise, for
architectures which do not implement prefetch, we have
	for (i = 0; i < size; i += 64) {
		{;}
		{;}
	}
and the compiler will *not* optimise this away.   The compiler deliberately
leaves this construct alone because it assumes the programmer is asking for
a busywait loop.
We shouldn't add a busywait loop to file_read_actor(), yes?
<ot>
Reminds me of a version of the Microsoft C compiler back in about '85 which
"optimise" away
	for ( ; ; )
		;
Completely.
</ot>
Is prefetching 4k at a time optimal?  Should the prefetch be embedded
in copy_*_user?
The code assumes that L1_CACHE_BYTES equates to the prefetch chunk.
Is this reasonable, or should it be abstracted out to a new PREFETCH_BYTES?
That `64' needs to be PREFETCH_BYTES * 2 or L1_CACHE_BYTES * 2, yes?
How come the code keeps prefetching the same address?  Shouldn't
we be adding `i' to the address in there?
The code makes no attempt to align the prefetch address to anything.
Should it?
What happens if a prefetch spills over the end of the page and
faults?

That'll do for now :)
