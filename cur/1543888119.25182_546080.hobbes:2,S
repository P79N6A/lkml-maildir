Of course, but if you're doing them on random-ish ranges, or multiple
files, or continually on the same file while parts of it get reclaimed
and reinstantiated...

I'm not sure that I would always agree. Sure if there is random *IO*
involved, then it is going to be slow and we won't be hitting page frames
so hard. But if there is random pagecache access, it will hit them almost
as hard.

Definitely agree there.
