You can strace BK and see what it does but I'll save you the trouble.
We never hold a mapping open to a file being written because we never
rewrite a file in place (that's a really bad thing for an SCM to do).
What we do is to write the file to SCCS/x.<filename> and then when it is
written we rename it to SCCS/s.<filename>.  Any process which wants to
map it is either going to get the old s.<filename> or the new s.<filename>
but there is no chance that we are extending the file while someone has it
mapped.  Famous last words and all that notwithstanding, that's my belief.
So unless I'm more dimwitted than normal we don't have any synchronization
problems by design.
