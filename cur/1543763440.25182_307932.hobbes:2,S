Yes, in current code. It was a bug. OTOH that means that you can not
suspend from safe mode, and that's good: if you *do* suspend from safe
mode, there's basically no way for you to resume [user *could* select
safe mode next time, and kill noresume, but I don't think many users
will figure that out.]
So I can fix the bug (patch was attached), but that means that it
would be nice to prevent suspend from safe mode in next SuSE... And
probably other distros, too.
(Safe mode is grub setting with noapic noresume....)
