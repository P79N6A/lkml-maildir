NACK.
Linus, Please DO NOT apply this as it is here... This same change above 
had to also be applied to the FusionHDTV3 Gold-T ... I've already 
applied the appropriate changes to cvs, and Mauro told me that he has 
mailed the patches to Andrew, although I do not see them here yet on 
LKML ....
I get the feeling you're not even close to releasing 2.6.15, so I'm sure 
the bugfix that Gene is waiting for will make it over to your tree soon, 
along with some other small v4l fixes that we had to make in order to 
account for changes in -rc4.
Gene, in the meantime, you can fix your situation without changing any 
code by simply issuing the following command:
modprobe tda9887
Ta - da! Magic!
Cheers,
Michael Krufky
