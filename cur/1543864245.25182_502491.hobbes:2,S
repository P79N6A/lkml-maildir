Actually that's a good idea - why don't we put up a
donation-for-hardware appeal on kernel.org and may be someplace more
visible to raise around 8K USD for a 2x2 AMD64 machine with say 8Gig
of RAM? May be the disks etc. stuff can be shared/re-used off the
DL380 G2?
The KDE guys did something like that a little while ago. I pledge my
USD 100 upfront and I don't think we should have trouble getting 80
people donating USD 100 each.
