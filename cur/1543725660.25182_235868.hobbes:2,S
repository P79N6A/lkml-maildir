Hi Jens,
Well I got a patch to stop cdrom.c from dropping to single frame as long 
as it has done multi-frame at least once and it seems to work for me but 
I obviously am not sure what implications this will have for lots of 
other users.
I was wondering if there was a way for the cdrom module to know when the 
media gets changed so that the flag can be cleared and only reset if we 
can do multi-frame DMA with the new media?
I have been digging through the code but can't see an obvious place 
where this happens, pointers and other comments welcome.
Currently I've got 2.6.7-rc3 patched, would you accept or you want me to 
check it goes cleanly into the latest and greatest?
Cheers,
   Nige
