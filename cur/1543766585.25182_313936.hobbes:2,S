Oh, okay then.  I guess I'll get back to work!
Actually, with RDMA, "I/O termination" technically doesn't happen until the memory is 
deregistered.  When the memory is registered, all that means is that it's should be pinned 
and the virtual-to-physical should be stored.  No actual I/O occurs at that point.

I was talking about the code that Roland mentioned in the first message of this thread - 
the user-space verbs support.  He said the code calls mlock() and get_user_pages().
FYI, our driver detects the process termination and cleans up everything itself.
