Hi,
I try to generate a big file with a kernel 2.4.2, and I can do it, but when I 
do ls -l, rm file, o something else with the file, I receive
# ls -l
ls: filename: Value too large for defined data type
I reboot with my old kernel, 2.2.18, and I can ls the file, renove it, etc... 
I can see that the created file is bigger than 2gb (the last I generate was 
2.7 gb). what happen? why I cannot ls the file with 2.4 and I can with 2.2?
I need files bigger than 2 gb, what can I do?
thanks.
