Doh, I missed the chunk of the block layer patch, sorry for that.

2.6.20 "good" kernel has newer build date then the "bad" 2.6.20.1
test kernel (with the IDE patchset reversed)?

Nope, unfortunately this only proves that all 2.6.20 changes modulo IDE
changes doesn't seem to cause the problems.  "Unfortunately" because it
would be much easier for me to just find guilty change in the patchset,
take the blame and fix it :-) but...
There are only 6 changes in the patchset which influence the _code_ that
is used by your hardware/driver configuration and none seems to actually
influence the driver _behavior_ on your system:
* [PATCH] ide-cd: Handle strange interrupt on the Intel ESB2
	the quirk code is not executed on ICH4 chipset
* [PATCH] PIIX: remove check for broken MW DMA mode 0
	dead code removal
* [PATCH] PIIX/SLC90E66: PIO mode fallback fix
	not used on your hardware as both hdc and hdd use DMA modes
* [PATCH] remove blk_queue_activity_fn
	dead code removal
* ide: unregister idepnp driver on unload
	ide-pnp is not used on this system
* [PATCH] lockdep: fix ide/proc interaction
	shouldn't change anything - the code is executed only during
	device driver (ide-cd etc.) removal
Besides the PCI configuration for IDE chipset is the same for both kernels.
Something really fishy is going on here... I'm out of ideas for the moment.
Maybe except retesting 2.6.19 + ide-2.6.20.patch applied...
Thanks,
Bart
