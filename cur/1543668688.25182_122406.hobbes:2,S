Based on various feedback, on my RH Linux 2.4.18 kernel I tried the
following:
Set "features" bit NETIF_F_IP_CSUM set (the only feature bit set).
In my network driver start-transmit check for "CHECKSUM_HW" in ip_summed.
Using a small test program, use "sendfile" to copy a file to a network
socket FD.
Result is none of the packets presented to my network adapter driver have
ip_summed set to CHECKSUM_HW, so the SW IP stack has already
computed checksums.
Is this mechanism possibly broken on kernel 2.4?
