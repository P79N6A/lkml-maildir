Subject: locking sectors of raw disk (raw read-write test of mounted disk)

I'd like to make read-write test of the raw disk, and disk has
mounted partitions. Is it possible to lock  range of sectors
of the raw device so that any kernel code that wants to write
to this range will sleep ? (so that test
    { lock range; read /dev/hda->buf; write buf->/dev/hda; unlock }
won't corrupt the filesysyem ?)
Thanks
Yakov
