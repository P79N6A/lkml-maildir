Hi,
I just put the latest drivers in git:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/chris/linux-2.6.git
currently ixp4xx-21 branch only (= based on 2.6.21).
Qmgr, NPE, Ethernet, HSS. This is my "export" repository, it doesn't
contain the history, though I'll try not to rebase it (or otherwise
make hard to merge).
It's not currently intended for mainstream inclusion, though it seems
stable at the moment (at least on my IXP425 rev B0).
1. Problems with draining RX descriptors fixed (Ethernet only - HSS
   firmware had no such issues)
2. Seems to work fine in both LE (data swapping) and BE modes (I haven't
   yet looked at LE data-coherency mode)
3. "Irqchip" not yet implemented (nor investigated). It will have to
   wait a bit.
4. Still uses Intel's format for firmware files. Honestly, I don't
   like it.
Ok. Now I'm leaving for ~ 3 weeks, so don't expect much from me in this
time.
