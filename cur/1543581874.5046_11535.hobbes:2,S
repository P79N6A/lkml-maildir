	There is no STANDARDS TRACK  RFC  saying anything about  List-Id:.
	There are only some individual's submission for a draft about it.
	It is also way overdue to expire (Expires September 23, 1999), and
	it has not been updated, nor advanced towards RFC.
	There are issues where me and DaveM are as obstinate as Linus,
	inserting lots of junky headers and munging others (e.g. Subject:)
	is a big no-no.    You can hash the issue all you want, but you
	can't convince me and DaveM.
	That  X-Mailing-List:  is actually a LOOP detection measure.

	I do have some plans which will change things at VGER, but those
	details are not ready for publishing yet.
