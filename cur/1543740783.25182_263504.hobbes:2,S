Oh, I do agree w/ this.
But if the OS<->hardware interface is kept simple (e.g. simple DMA ring 
of items to execute, or just xfer to video RAM, and perhaps another 
response msg ring) then the impact of any design changes you -do- make 
are mitigated, and the OS driver is kept small and simple as well.
