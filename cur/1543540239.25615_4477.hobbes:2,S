Well the problem has been around since I tried the 2.4.0-test3 Kernel and is still here in 2.4.0-test5-pre6.
I also reported the problem to the kernel list but with no replies.
> what routing problem do you have?
Using a dialup modem ISP connection, just before the message "local  IP address: ....." is logged i get the error message:
"default route ioctl(SIOCADDRT): Network unreachable (101)"
Booting in the 2.2.16 kernel does not give me this error.
I am running:
RH6.1 (i386)
Kernel 2.4.0-test5-pre6
PPPD 2.4.0b4 (and have tried b1)
