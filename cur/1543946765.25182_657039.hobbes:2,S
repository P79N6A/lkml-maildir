Hi!

How long will be that delay?
If they are really users of that kind of thing, this should be fixed by adding
a "delay_us_before_xfer" field in the  struct spi_transfer.
Have you tested it? I think if you start a transfer with 0 len, the ENDRX bit
will never rise, however, I'm not sure about this.
