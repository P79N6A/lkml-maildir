Hi Toralf,
	Can you list the o/p you see for overall cpu usage? You should
see something like below right at the top of the o/p:
top - 20:03:59 up 12 days, 21:39, 18 users,  load average: 0.22, 0.20, 0.25
Tasks: 200 total,   5 running, 193 sleeping,   0 stopped,   2 zombie
Cpu(s):  2.6% us,  1.3% sy,  0.0% ni, 96.0% id,  0.0% wa,  0.0% hi, 0.0% si,  0.0% st
The third line (giving overall cpu usage stats) is what is interesting here.
If you have more than one cpu, you can get cpu usage stats for each cpu
in top by pressing 1. Can you provide this information with and w/o 
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED?
If I am not mistaken, cpu ondemand gov goes by the cpu idle time stats,
which should not be affected by FAIR_GROUP_SCHED. I will lookaround for
other possible causes.
