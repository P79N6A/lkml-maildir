Well, obviously, since apparently LILO doesn't properly null-terminate 
long command line.
Thinking about it a bit, the way to deal with the LILO problem is 
probably to actually *usw* the boot loader ID byte we've had in there 
since the 2.00 protocol.  In other words, if the boot loader ID is 0x1X 
where X <= current version (I don't know how LILO manages this ID) then 
truncate the command line to 255 bytes; when this is fixed in LILO then 
LILO gets to bump its boot loader ID version number.
