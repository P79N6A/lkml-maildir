The native driver reports pressure as either 65535 or 0, and doesn't
(seem to) scale the x/y values at all.  The uncalibrated values and
180 degree rotation (actually, my phone shows a slight rotation error
or a few pixels) are definitely reported to user space without
modification.
A matrix-based recalibrator will handle any orientation so long as the
corners are known, and so long as you report a pressure of zero
meaning "pen up" everything should be compatible regardless of the
units you choose.
