Hmm.  This scenario seems totally bogus.

Hmmm, 32MiB of RAM on a 586-class machine, and its doing useful work as both a
webserver and running GnuCash?  Care to construct something more real-world?
Even at that:

Uh, no.  Try `lsmod`.

Autoconfigure not necessary; read the output of lsmod, or read modules.conf.
Problem solved.
