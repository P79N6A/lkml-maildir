Wrong and right. XFS uses files for the backing store for quota
information, though it does handle quotas very differently to every
other Linux filesystem.
On remount-ro, we simply flush all the dirty dquots to their backing
store so the dquots can then be treated as ro just like every other object
in the filesystem. You don't need to turn off quotas to do this....
Cheers,
