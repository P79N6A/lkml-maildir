That's understandable. I cannot require them to go out of their way to
accommodate my desire for tinkering. When they decide to actually put
time and effort into preventing me from tinkering then I get a bit
annoyed. I still cannot really do much about it though. If people keep
buying the crap then it will continue to be produced. What I can do is
say that such a system is not allowed to be based on my work. It may not
matter in the long run, but at least I'm doing something. Things might
get better by itself, or worse for that matter, but I'd prefer to not
stand idly by, hoping it will go the way I'd like.
I try to not sound like a doomsday prophet, but I tend to get a bit
worked up when I consider what it would be like with this DRM nonsense
taken to the extreme. :)
