Yes. I could also change cryptsetup to not mlockall the whole
application just because the key is passed down to libdevmapper which
does not treat parameters with special care.

Well, I don't. I don't know any tools that actually use the
DM_DEVICE_TABLE command except cryptsetup. I don't like to make the
interface inconsistent just because there might be an incompetent root
sitting in front of the machine.
