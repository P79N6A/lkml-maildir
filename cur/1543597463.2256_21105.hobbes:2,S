No, when you're going to decide ( reschedule_idle ) which idle to spin out, you
can inspect the wake list and, based on the content of the list, one can take a
better decision about which idle to wake.
I think that a list, instead of a single task pointer, is a more open solution
that could drive to a more sophisticated choice of the CPU to stock the task to.
