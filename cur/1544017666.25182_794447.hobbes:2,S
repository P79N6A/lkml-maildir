We do have uintptr_t inside the kernel (it is typedeffed to unsigned
long) but I used it explicitly because its type is defined to be large
enough to store any pointer.
However, I have also verified that using a newer compiler (4.3.2 in my
case) makes the warning go away as Hannes Eder pointed out when
mentioning his earlier patch.
So, your choice.
