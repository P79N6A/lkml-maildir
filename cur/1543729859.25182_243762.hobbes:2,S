Patchset update.
These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness with
specific emphasis on the desktop, but configurable to any workload.

Patches:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.8.1/2.6.8.1-ck3/
ck2 was very similar for internal testing and didn't have the final fix 
for the cd audio burning problem making a new version necessary.
Added since 2.6.8.1-ck1:
+limit_hz.diff
minimise the lower Hz setting until I get a better fix for the rare
problem that occurs low Hz into staircase.
+cddvd-cmdfilter-drop.patch
back out changes that prevent non-root users writing cds until userspace
catches up
+cool-spinlocks-i386.diff
completely out of line spinlocks decrease kernel size and may decrease
cache trashing
+bio_uncopy_user-mem-leak.patch
+bio_uncopy_user2.diff
These are the bugfixes for the memory leak and the dud cds burnt when
burning audio and videocds
+fbsplash-0.9-r5-2.6.8-rc3.patch.bz2
Early release of gensplash (replacement for bootsplash) patch for
graphical bootup; see: 
http://dev.gentoo.org/~spock/projects/gensplash/
+make-tree_lock-an-rwlock.patch.bz2
+invalidate_inodes-speedup.patch
Compatibility patches for reiser4 from -mm
+2.6.8.1-mm2-reiser4.diff.bz2
Reiser4 filesystem
Changed:
~kiflush3.diff
Fixed the software suspend bug; changed the daemon to sleep for a minute
if it goes idle and be put to sleep if kswapd wakes up.
~akpm-latency-fix.patch
Rolled up latency hacks
Removed:
-token-thrashing-control
This was adversely affecting performance at low to medium levels of swap 
usage which is far more common than swap trashing.
