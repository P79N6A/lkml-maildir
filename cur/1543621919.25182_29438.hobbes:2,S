The "Redundant entry" message comes out of serial.c when a card is found in
the PCI ID board list, but which function serial_pci_guess_board() also
detects as a generic single UART card (and overwrites the card's
board->flags field in the pci_boards[] array). 
Does anybody think this is a feature? Did I misunderstand?
I suspect that the thought was to detect and eventually remove pci_boards[]
entries for generic single-port cards that could also be detected by the
serial_pci_guess_board() function. Can anybody confirm or deny? 
Shouldn't the detection process be considered done when the PCI IDs match?
Why should the "guess" function even be called when the card has already
been found in the PCI board table?
