**ALL** Netware network drivers support a scatter/gather proramming
interface, whether the hardware does or not.  In NetWare, the drivers
get passed a fragment list in what's called an ECB (Event Control
Block).  It's the drivers responsiblity to assemble the fragment lists. 
We did it this way to support scatter/gather cards and non-scatter
gather cards in one interface.  Those drivers that do not support
scatter gather DMA operations copy to a local buffer to assemble the
packet.  Those with a shared memory window copy data from the fragment
list into this window until a complete IEEE frame gets completed (since
it will get copied anyway), then hit the register bits to initiate a
send of the data.
