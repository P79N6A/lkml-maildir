Yes this is an SMP system (Intel Tiger4).  Cpu0 is the boot cpu, and is
indeed the one that takes the write lock, and thus the fast-return from
the get_counter() code.  I'm just very confused as to why I only see these
10X worse outliers on cpu3.  There doesn't seem to be anything special
about it (/proc/interrupts shows similar stuff happening on each cpu).

What do you mean by "properly synchronized"?  We can't get them
completely in step ... but we do know that they are very close.
Closer than the microsecond granularity that most users (gettimeofday)
are going to pass back to the caller.  But running with "nojitter" will
occasionally result in time (as seen on two different processors) sometimes
jumping back by a microsecond.  How bad is this in practice?  I can
see that a user that simply subtracts two times may sometimes see an
answer of minus one micro-second ... but does this hurt?
