Sergey Vlasov recently reported some other apps:
-------------- cut ---------------
Changing PAGE_OFFSET this way would break at least Valgrind (the latest
release 3.1.0 by default is statically linked at address 0xb0000000, and
PIE support does not seem to be present in that release).  I remember
that similar changes were also breaking Lisp implementations (cmucl,
sbcl), however, I am not really sure about this.
-------------- cut ---------------
Also, why would one expect 4GB of VM on x86-64 if normally have 3GB on 
i686? Anyway, as it is tunable, people can select which one they prefer.
Thanks,
Kirill
