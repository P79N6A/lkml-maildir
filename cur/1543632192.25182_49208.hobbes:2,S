Hi,
I've got a new laptop here with a chipset that isn't currently properly 
identified/configured by linux (it's Intel 845MP based - specifically, 
Linux doesn't recognise the ISA bridge component which controls sound 
card etc.).
I'd like to fix this up myself so I was wondering if someone could give 
me some pointers to bits of kernel code/documentation I should be 
looking at before undertaking this work?
Thanks,
Dan.
