Subject: 2.4.0test2: /dev/sda has wrong major or minor number

I use an Adaptec 2940UW (AHA7881U) and an Adaptec 2904E (AHA7850, rev3). I have
one block device (Olympus PowerMO 230) connected to the 2904 adapter.
With kernel 2.4.0test1, I can mount /dev/sda without problems, but
with kernel 2.4.0test2, a mount leads to:
/dev/sda has wrong major or minor number
Mounting my SCSI cdrom (/dev/scd0) is no problem in both cases, only
the SCSI disk device doesn't work.
Access rights are
brw-rw---- root disk     /dev/sda
(block major 8, minor 0)
(I am member of group 'disk')
