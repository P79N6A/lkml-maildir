Ok, the freeze at day change was random, a pure hoax of my PC! This time
it happened at 17:35 somehow.
Sadly this fｧ"$% minicom trunkated the state dump at top while my pc
rebootet :-( STOP, it is not trunkated, one sees the Show State command
at the first line :)
Andrew, the mpd tasks are still in there, may be you recognize a
similair pattern in its state or even not, one knows more then...
Again, this one

Graphics Card which has two Outputs?
Regards, Konsti
