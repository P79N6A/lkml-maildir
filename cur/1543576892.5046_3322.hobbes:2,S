This is a refinement of the idea and some abstraction like that is
clearly needed, and maybe that is exactly the right one.  For now I'm
interested in putting this on the table so that we can check the
stability and performance, maybe uncover come more bugs, then start
going after some of the things that need to be done to turn it into a
useful option.
P.S., I humbly apologize for writing (!offset && bytes == PAGE_SIZE)
when I could have just written (bytes == PAGE_SIZE).
