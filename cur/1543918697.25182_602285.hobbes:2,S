I attempted bisecting - and failed. The problem is that
2.6.23rc7 seems very unstable, but 2.6.22rc4 is much better
but not perfect. 2.6.22rc4 only crashed once - it can compile for
hours and swap lots and keep running. But it died at least once.
I'll try running recent kernels with more debugging instead.
I think I used SLUB instead of SLAB - either way I can switch
that over to see if it changes things.
