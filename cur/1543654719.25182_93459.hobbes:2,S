This doesn't reassure me :-) but I didn't get the choice for an SMP 
machine with some athlon processors.
Note that I am also able to use IDE DMA with the kernel 2.4.8 (ie hdparm 
-d 1 /dev/hd. works)
So now, do you want me to try other kernel version in order to find in 
what version the problem appeared?
