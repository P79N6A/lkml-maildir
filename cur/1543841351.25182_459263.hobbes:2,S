Actually, the same patch, but other pieces of it ...

In the old (up to -rc5) code, we had
		if (unw_ret > 0 && !arch_unw_user_mode(&info)) {
			< all the fallback handling>
		}
with no else, thus just falling through (without even changing the
stack pointer, which was wrong when unw_ret > 0 but we reached
a user mode address (i.e. as in the example here, after unwinding
out of a syscall frame).
