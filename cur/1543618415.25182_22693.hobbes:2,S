Actually there is a (badly commented) optimisation here. (OK so it isn't
commented at all :)
The code used to say: 
        int oldval = xchg(&current->need_resched, -1);
	if (!oldval) {
		while(current->need_resched == -1)
			; /* Do Nothing */
	}
We atomically grab the current value of need_resched and replace it with
-1. The -1 tells the scheduler that we are busy looping and it doesnt need
to send an IPI to force a reschedule.
