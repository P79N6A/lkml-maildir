Hi,
where's the source code to the aurema ressource mangment modules
localted for which hooks appeared in suse's kernel tree recently?
Any module using these hooks is clearly a derived work of the
linux kernel and thus needs to be distributed under the GPL aswell.
For the LKML readers, the patches are
