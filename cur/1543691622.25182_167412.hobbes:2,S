Subject: RH-9 boot hangs from floppy bootdisk

Hi,
I have just installed RH-9 from ISO images I downloaded yesterday.
This system used to run RH-7.3 until this morning. The RH install CD ran 
and installed just fine, and I created a boot disk on floppy.  I 
installed GRUB on the first partition of my RH drive, but not on the MBR.
I have 2 hard-drives, with Win-XP Pro on the first one (C:, /dev/hda) 
and RH (D:, /dev/hdb) on the second.  I also have a DVD-ROM (E:, 
/dev/hdc) and a CD-RW drive (F: /dev/hdd).
When booting from floppy, it loads the kernel/ramdisk from floppy, then 
recognizes the HW and then hangs with the following message (at the 
bottom).  Hitting any key causes a single "keyboard: unknown keysequence 
0e .." and then I have to hard-reset to recover.
Any help would be most appreciated.  Here's the console output:
