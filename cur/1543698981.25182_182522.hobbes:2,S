      Let me just add a me-too here. 
      Haven't got the oops on my desk, here, but from what I could
      see, the error occurred in find_appropriate_src, somewhere in
      ipchains.  
      Further, possibly irrelevant datapoint: ABIT BP6, ne2k-pci and
      3Com590 network cards. When the oops occurs, everything locks,
      capslock and scrolllock are lit. 
      I can reproduce the error by letting a second system ping the
      first, on the internal network. Sometimes it doesn't even
      complete a full boot. 
      I'll try and capture more detail tonight. 
      TimT.

One time I went to a museum where all the work in the museum had been
done by children. They had all the paintings up on refrigerators.
