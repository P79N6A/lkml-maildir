No.  That is why I specified "not useful when separated".  I also
intentionally avoided the phrase "derived work": the legal definition
of derived work is based on entirely different factors.
If the signature is one that serves to indicate origin, to detect
tampering, or the other things you mentioned, the program's binary is
useful when separated from the signature.  My objection arises when a
functionally equivalent binary -- including advertised functions such
as "runs on platform XYZ" -- cannot be produced from the distributed
source code.
