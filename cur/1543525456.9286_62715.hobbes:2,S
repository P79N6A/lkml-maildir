Jan Astalos <astalos@tuke.sk> has some patches which make use of the TSC
for precise time accounting.
On 586/686 you could use the MSRs to get exact user/kernel cycle numbers
too, but i'm afraid that would be way to slow to be acceptable as a
generic solution (a lot extra cycles per every ctx switch).
