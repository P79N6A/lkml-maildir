Bart, is there any chace you could change the printks to show the name of
the command that caused the drive to produce the error (assuming non
ide-tcq, with tcq I'd immagine that it'd be a bit harder).
This way someone who hasn't read the IDE spec might be able to tell that
this isn't a warning of impending failure.
BTW, is this information encoded in the two lines above somewhere, and if so
how would I read it?
Thanks,
Mike
