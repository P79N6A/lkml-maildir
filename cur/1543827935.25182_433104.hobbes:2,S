-mm has some support for the dock, but there isn't support for hot 
add/remove of the optical device yet.  I think that's waiting on some 
support in libata, but I'm not exactly sure what's needed.
At the moment, you either get the dock optical if you boot the machine 
in the dock, and you can never eject the dock, or you get no optical and 
eject works fine.
