I'd rather the blinky sign was "ext4". It makes it clear it is a
progression and it also gives everyone something to put in the features
box and talk to the press about 8)

We recently fixed a 'If the disk is 4TB in size the geometry reporting
breaks and parted crashes' bug. The stuff is out there and people want
to run ext3 on it or an ext3 derivative they feel they trust. Does it
matter whether it is the most optimal solution, that'll sort itself out
as ext3.5/ext4, reiser4, jfs, xfs etc get picked and demanded by users
