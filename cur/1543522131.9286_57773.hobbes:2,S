     I'm a little confused actually.  The fix was to change:
        pagesize = getpagesize();
		-TO-
        pagesize = PAGE_SIZE;
     ... in mkswap.c.
     That did make it work, but it seems to me to be fundamentally wrong.  If
getpagesize() is returning the wrong value, it would seem to me that really
that is what needs to be fixed if it is really incorrect, it returns a page
size of 8192 as opposed to 4096, the value in PAGE_SIZE, and this is on a Sun
4/670MP.
