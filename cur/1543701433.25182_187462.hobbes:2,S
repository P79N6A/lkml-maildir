This seems to be a descendant of this one: 
<
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/openxdsm/openxdsm/eventmodule/>
It works, but it is a slow and ugly hack to just hook into every syscall 
that does something with files. And it is quite slow and ambiguous to 
log paths instead of inodes since file paths are not unique (hard links 
etc).
But I will take a look at that code to see how they get the events to 
user space.

File change notification would be immensely useful. I think there is a 
consensus about that.
