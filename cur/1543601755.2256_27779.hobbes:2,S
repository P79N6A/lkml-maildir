Coroutines or not, this does not change the picture.
All multiplexed servers have an IO driven scheduler that calls
code sections based on the fd.
Obviously if you've a one-thread-per-socket model, epoll is not your answer.

Again, no.
If you need to request the current status of a socket you've to f_ops->poll the fd.
The cost of the extra read, done only for fds that are not "ready", is nothing
compared to the cost of a linear scan with HUGE numbers of fds.
You could implement a solution where the low level io functions goes directly to write
inside the mmapped fd set where the data buffer is empty or the out buffer is full.
This would be a way more intrusive patch whose perf gain won't match the cost.
