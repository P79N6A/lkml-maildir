  The current behaviour allows the system to hang forever waiting for
sync(2). In practice it does actually wait minutes on a busy system (df
has --no-sync for that reason) when there is no reason for that to happen.
I think that not only sucks worse, it's non-standard as well.

  Because people count on something broken we should keep the bug? You do
realize that the sync may NEVER finish? That's not in theory, I have news
servers which may wait overnight without finishing a "df" iwthout the
option.

  I think the wording is queued, and I would read that as "on the
elevator." Your example is a good example of bad practive, since even with
ext3 a program creating files quickly would lose data, even though the
directory structure is returned to a known state, without stopping the
writing processes the results are unknown.

  No one has proposed otherwise. Unless you think that a possible hang is
useful, the questions becomes adding all dirty buffers to the elevator,
then (a) waiting or (b) returning. Either satisfies SuSv2.

  If you discount the evidence you can prove anything... or disbelieve
anything.
