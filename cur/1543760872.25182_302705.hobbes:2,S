Oh me bad, I should listen to whatever is being said, instead
of doing my stupid guesses...  Just rebooted into 2.6.11.3
with usb-handoff and both the keyboard and mouse are Just Works,
and psmouse driver loads almost immediately too.
Also, it works just fine after turning off USB Keyboard and
Mouse support in BIOS and without usb-handoff kernel parameter.
In 2.6.9 (it works just fine too, problem happens with 2.6.10
and up only), there's no such parameter in drivers/pci/quirks.c.
Hmm.
So is this a bios/mobo problem, or can it be solved in kernel
somehow?
Thanks very much for your attention.
