That was on ext2.  There isn't much i/o on autoconf "make check".
It's a lot of small perl scripts, m4 and gcc on tiny files.

That was ext2 too.

Oracle doing reads/writes to preallocated, contiguous files is more 
important than tiobench.  Oracle datafiles are typically created
sequentially, which wouldn't exercise the pathology.
I pay more attention the OSDL-DBT-3 and "Winmark I" numbers than 
the i/o stuff I run.  (I look at my numbers more, but care about
theirs more).
What about the behavior where CPU utilization goes down as thread
count goes up?  Is she just i/o bound?
