You'll need to do priority ceiling emulation as well. I've been using that in an
application as a manual means of preventing preemption of key critical sections,
like a spinlock/preempt_disable(), to prevent priority inversion from happening.
Raising the priority of threads using that lock/critical section is a pretty
effective means of partitioning program logical sections of the application into
threads that are higher and lower priority than the resource. It's cool stuff.
