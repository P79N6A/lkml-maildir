I've proposed in the past a more extensive version of this.
make register
or similar.
Which you run, and it grabs a snapshot of system setup, optionally
with comments, and sends it in to a registry.
You can then do 
make comment
and report issues.
These would vary from "it crashes", to "my hard drive died/is dying"
So we get information on systems, and some idea on which are reliable
or not.
Last time some people disagreed with this obviously brilliant idea. :/
