I sent a new patch to glibc maintainer, but didn't get response. So resend it here.
Glibc arena is to decrease the malloc/free contention among threads. But arena
chooses to shrink agressively, so also grow agressively. When heaps grow, mprotect
is called. When heaps shrink, mmap is called. In kernel, both mmap and mprotect
need hold the write lock of mm->mmap_sem which introduce new contention. The new
contention actually causes the arena effort to become 0.
Here is a new patch to address this issue.
