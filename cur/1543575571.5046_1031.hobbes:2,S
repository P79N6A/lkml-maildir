Same latencies as 2.2.16 and 2.2.17 vanilla,
over 75 seconds to wait on an other screen!
And top(1) on a serial VT510 freezes.
Machine loaded with 2 setiathome and
Doug Ledford's memtest.
ASUS P2B-DS Dual PIII550 1024MB memory,
only SCSI devices (no IDE!).
Andrea Arcangeli's ..17pre6aa2, ..18pre17aa1
and ..18pre21aa2 reduced the latency <2 secs.
