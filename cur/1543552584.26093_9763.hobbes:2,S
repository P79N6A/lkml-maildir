msgsnd seems to be corrupting memory around the msgbuf pointer.
for example I have the following code:
pMsgBuf = malloc(iPacketLen + 4 + 8);
bzero(pMsgBuf, iPacketLen + 4 + 8);
pMsgBuf += 4; /* Build a guard band */
printf("PMQ:pMsgBuf: %p\n",pMsgBuf);
printf("PMQ:-4: %p\n", *(pMsgBuf-4));
rc = msgsnd(iMsgQueueID, pMsgBuf, iPacketLen, 0); 
printf("AMQ:pMsgBuf: %p\n",pMsgBuf);
printf("AMQ:-4: %p\n", *(pMsgBuf-4));
results in the following output:
PMQ:pMsgBuf: 0x8067424
PMQ:-4: (nil)
AMQ:pMsgBuf: 0x8067424
AMQ:-4: 0x3
clearly, AMQ:-4 should print (nil).
Any ideas as to what could be going wrong?
I'm am running a stock Redhat 6.1 system, kernel 2.2.14 I believe.
This is also causing a segmentation fault.
