Hi,
I'm not subscribed to the list, but maybe this information can help you to 
check your code.
I have tried to use linux raid 0.9 with kernel 2.4.9-ac9. 
This is on a Asus A7V266 with two ide disks at the VIA vt8233 ide controler, 
NIC Realtek 8139too.
Everything works fast and stable, but if I read files remotly I got very 
often: 
Stale NFS file handle.
With 2.410.pre5 I don't see this message any longer, but the machine freezes 
completly after a few minutes while I'm reading from remote (no messages in 
the logfile).
Regards
Harald
