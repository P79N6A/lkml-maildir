	Ok, so there is no such flag over the NFSv3 XDR protocol,
	however:
	The NFSv3 SERVER (for which Andrea made his patch)
	actually MUST open local files with O_LARGEFILE
	flag set.  (Otherwise e.g. EXT2 may reject the open.)
	The NFSv3 CLIENT code must do post-open verification,
	that if the opened file has size exceeding 2G-1, and
	O_LARGEFILE flag is not set, the opened file must be
	closed, and caller must be informed of the rejection
	with  -EFBIG  status.
	(If possible, do that size verification before open.)
	Am I making any sense ?
