Problem is, 'unprepared' ISA cards are electrically unable to share interrupts 
(like in: an interrupting card cant't drive the interrupt line high while at 
the same time another one actively drives it at a low level). You _can_ make 
things work when you replace the IRQ-selection-jumper on all sharing devices 
with a diode and add a pull down resistor.  BTDT - works sufficiently well.

Yes, they usually contain the necessary sharing circuity onboard. But you 
can't share them with other instances of the same or other cards unless you 
make the modifications above.
Unfortunately on-board serial ports seldom have IRQ-jumpers - which makes them 
practically not shareable at all.
And for PNP devices, well they also don't have jumpers. It is possible
to find the necessary wires on the pcb though ..... ;-) 
Bye,
Thorsten
