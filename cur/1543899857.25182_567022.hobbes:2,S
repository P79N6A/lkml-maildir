Interesting. What kernel version are you using?

I don't think there has been a significant change in the area of
memory efficiency in either since I last tested, and Christoph and
I both produced the same result.
I can't say where SLOB is losing its memory, but there are a few
places that can still be improved, so I might get keen and take
another look at it once all the improvements to both allocators
gets upstream.
