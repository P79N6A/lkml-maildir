>> clock drift of a few minutes per day.
That's about 0.1%.  It may be relatively large compared to tolerances of
hardware clocks, but it's realistically tiny.  It certainly compares
favourably with mkLinux on my PowerBook 5300, which usually drifts by
several hours per day regardless of actual load.
The drift might be caused by something masking interrupts for too long, too
often, considering you state that the hardware clock remains comparatively
well-synced.  As another poster suggests, the framebuffer may be to blame.
