Indeed.  We could also make this transparent to userspace by using a script
to copy the user-* headers to /usr/include.  Something like this:
install_user_headers:
	$(srctree)/scripts/install_user_headers.sh
#!/bin/bash
rm -rf /usr/include/asm /usr/include/linux /usr/include/asm-generic
mkdir /usr/include/asm /usr/include/linux /usr/include/asm-generic
to_user() {
	sed	-e 's,<user/,<linux/, \
		-e 's,<user-generic/,<asm-generic,' \
		-e 's,<user-[^/]*/,<asm,' \
		<$1 >$2
}
for src in include/user/*; do
	to_user $src /usr/include/linux/`basename $src`
done
for src in include/user-$ARCH/*; do
	to_user $src /usr/include/asm/`basename $src`
done
for src in include/user-generic/*; do
	to_user $src /usr/include/asm-generic/`basename $src`
done
If we really wanted to get fancy, we could also sed __u32 to uint32_t.
But that would probably cause more pain, confusion, hurt and bad feeling
than I'd ever want to be responsible for.

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
