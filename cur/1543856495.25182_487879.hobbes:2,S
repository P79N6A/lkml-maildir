So why do you want the system to swap _less_? You need to find some free 
memory for the additional processes to run in, and you have lots of 
inactive pages, so I think you want to swap out _more_ pages.
I'd suggest to temporarily add a swapfile before you update your system. 
This can even help in bringing your memory use to the state before if you 
do it like this
  - swapon additional swapfile
  - update your database software
  - swapoff swap partition
  - swapon swap partition
  - swapoff additional swapfile
