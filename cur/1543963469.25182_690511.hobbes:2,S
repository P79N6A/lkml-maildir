 Well, I think it should be reasonable to convert everything but lib/, the
latter being used for various implicit bits like strcpy() or whatever some
version of GCC may come up with.  Plus possibly generic code overridable
by boards for optimisation; I am not sure if we have got left any at the
moment though.
 With the much better configuration language of 2.6 and more and more 
stuff being done by magic sections bits built as libraries cause more 
hassle than convenience.
