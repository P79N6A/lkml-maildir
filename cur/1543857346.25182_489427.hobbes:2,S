Incorrect.  pre-v6 ARM bitops for test_and_xxx_bit() all do:
	save and disable irqs
	load value
	test bit
	if not in desired state, alter bit and write it back
	restore irqs
but I don't guarantee that we'll always do that - indeed, post-armv6
bitops always write back even if the bit was in the desired state.
