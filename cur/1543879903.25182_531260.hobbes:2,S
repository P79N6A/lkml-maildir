A couple of points.
- chroot can be escaped, it is just a chdir for the root directory it
  is not a security feature.  The only security is that you have to be root to call chdir.
  A carefully done namespace setup won't have that issue.
- While it may not violate security as far as what a user is allowed to modify it may
  violate security as far as what a user is allowed to see.
There are interesting per login cases as well such as allowing a user to replicate
their mount tree from another machine when they log in.  When /home is on a network
filesystem this can be very practical and can allow propagation of mounts across
machines not just across a single login session.
