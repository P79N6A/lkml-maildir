Nice too see that you're alive Ian ;)
I've been trying to send you some mail regarding your SD implementation 
but I haven't received any replies. Perhaps they've gotten lost somewhere?
I've made my own SD patch using some of your work but also a lot of my 
own stuff. I had some problems getting your patches to apply cleanly to 
the current tree so I reimplemented it using your code as a template.
The patch can be found at:
http://projects.drzeus.cx/wbsd/sd.php
That page also contains the legal issues as I've understood them.
A summary of what I've done (relative your work):
* flags renamed to caps to better reflect what it does.
* SD_4_BITS changed to 4_BIT_DATA. Hopefully 4-bit mode in SD and MMC 
will be compatible, at least on the driver level.
* HOST_ changed to MMC_ to conform with the rest of the macros.
* Added a function in the driver to test for SD read-only switch.
* Moved SD-specific commands to a separate section in the header so they 
are more easily distinguished.
* SCR register is read from card and used when determining bus width.
* I've separated SD detection a bit.
* The mode (SD/MMC) of the host is stored. Since MMC uses a bus topology 
and SD uses a star one it is useful to be able to see which mode the 
controller is in.
I also couldn't find the reason for the ACMD flags you've added. 
Application commands only differ in semantics, not format, so I couldn't 
figure out why these where needed. Perhaps I'm missing something.

I have specs for SD cards from Sandisk and Toshiba. Both found on the 
respective manufacturer's site using google. These have been the basis 
for my work.

My code is based on the SD card specs I've found so it probably isn't as 
safe.
