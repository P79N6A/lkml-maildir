Linus,
This is where I have to respectfully disagree. There are types of loads
that aren't covered in SCHED_OTHER. They are typically certain real time
loads and those folks (regardless of -rt patch) would benefit greatly
from having something like that in place. Those scheduler developers can
plug in (at compile time) their work without having to track and forward
port their code constantly so that non-SCHED_OTHER policies can be
experimented with easily.
This is especially so with rate monotonic influenced schedulers that are
in the works by real time folks, stock kernel or not. This is about
making Linux generally accessible to those folks and not folks doing
SCHED_OTHER work. They are orthogonal.
