I think the real question is: What does this "band edge" bit actually do?
Did you notice any difference when setting it? Does TX power in/decrease?
Did you see differences in the physical range (max distance from the AP
for which you're still able to connect).
I don't know what channel 1 and 11 have in common. Why don't we set the
bit for channel 14? Isn't that an "edge", too?
