This exposes more implementation detail than I think is good.
Something like a memory controller should use a more abstract
interface like bytes, and do the conversion to/from its internal
"natural" units like pages internally. E.g. the example cpu accounting
controller that I included with my patch set reports usage in
milliseconds, even though it counts internally in jiffies.
