Eric,
Finally got around to trying 2.1.6 - everything works great, and I'm really
impressed!  Looks like killer stuff.  Two things:
1) I noticed you've been pining the lists for EISA information.  I don't know a
whole lot about EISA systems or anything, but I do have a 486 EISA board and
an EISA network card I'd be willing to send you if you wanted a system to play
around with.  I don't use it anymore and it's just gathering dust in my
basement.
2) It seems that searching is broken.  I didn't see anything in TODO and
couldn't find any bug reports on linux-kernel or kbuild-devel.  Pressing '/' to
search on any screen, for any text results in the following crash:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cml2/cmlconfigure.py", line 3312, in ?
    main(options, arguments)
  File "cml2/cmlconfigure.py", line 3218, in main
    curses.wrapper(curses_style_menu, config, banner)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.0/curses/wrapper.py", line 44, in wrapper
    res = apply(func, (stdscr,) + rest)
  File "cml2/cmlconfigure.py", line 1154, in __init__
    self.interact(config)
  File "cml2/cmlconfigure.py", line 1782, in interact
    recompute = self.symbol_menu_command(cmd, sel_symbol)
  File "cml2/cmlconfigure.py", line 1535, in symbol_menu_command
    configuration.debug_emit(1, "hits: " + str(hits))
  File "cml2/cmlsystem.py", line 134, in _newstr
    if symbol.frozen():
  File "cml2/cmlsystem.py", line 154, in _frozen
    if symbol.iced:
AttributeError: 'ConfigSymbol' instance has no attribute 'iced'
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
Other than that, this look really awesome!
Thanks,
