I have neither of these locally. I suspect someone needs to care enough
about the code for anything to happen soon. I suppose there are things
that probably weren't tried, e.g. auditing to make sure dependencies on
external synchronization are taken care of, removing implicit sleeping
with the BKL held, then punt a private recursive spinlock in reiser3's
direction. Not sure what went on, or if I want to get involved in this
particular case.
