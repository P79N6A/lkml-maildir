Ugh... yes, but not with an 80386, i486, Pentium, Pentium-MMX,
5x86, Crusoe, WinChip, K6, K6-2, or 6x86. Also not with XT disks
or anything off the EISA, VLB, and MCA busses.
So it is OK to enable multi-terabyte access only when the
kernel is compiled for a modern non-laptop chip, and to prevent
use of ancient hardware in such a system. This ought to severely
reduce the need to muck with drivers for 1980's hardware.
