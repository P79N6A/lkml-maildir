make needs comparing timestamps between two files. I cannot imagine
how you can get this working (without network filesystem you can
have global gen_count, but with network filesystem each server has
its own gen_count... and using world-wide nanoseconds instead of world-wide
gen_count looks much simpler to me ;-) )
