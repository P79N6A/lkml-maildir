Sounds like a wise move, the msg_hdr structure again contains pointers which
might point to invalid memory.
What you could try to do is master git and get it to output a diff of
relevant files from your previous version to 2.6.14. Sadly, that might be a
lot of files.. If you start tracing from udp_recvmsg you quickly end up in a
heap of files which might be generating EFAULT.
Good luck!
