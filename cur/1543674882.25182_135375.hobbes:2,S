Of course that is doable, when I killed scsi_dma.c it was just a direct
replacement. Given that IDE had no such dynamic sg list allocation
requirements, it stayed in SCSI. Overdesign is never good :)

This should be doable.

This is harder, because it involves more than one specific queue.

Completely agree.

Again, block layer queueing was designed for what I needed (ide tcq) and
no overdesign was attempted. If you describe what you need, I'd be very
happy to oblige and add those bits. Some decent depth change handling, I
presume?
