Hello ...
I got an Kernel oops in 2.2.7 ...
After installing Suse 6.1 from scratch, I also made my own kernel.
I had to compile more than once till I set all the parameters correctly
Finally it was very fine, ....
except for X, because the mouse did not work ..
I did a gpm --- nothing
cat /dev/ttyS0, cat /dev/ttyS1 reported an input/output-error
proc/devices reports, that ttyS is loaded
lsmod reports, that module serial is loaded ...
This made me thinking, because I was pretty sure, that I had compiled in serial
support within the kernel core itself ..
I tried just to unload the serial and did a
cat /dev/ttyS1 again
Then the kernel crashed ..
It reported, that the attemption was done do kill the idle task while swapping
?!?!?!?(what means this)
Nevertheless, I deleted the serial.o in /lib/modules/2.2.7/misc, after getting
through the file system check, and starting again
The automounter now reported, that he was not able to find this module, but the
serial port worked then
What did !!!I!!! do wrong ?
Nevertheless ...
The automounter should never be able to load a module, which is still
integrated within the kernel
any suggestions?
