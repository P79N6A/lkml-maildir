Yep, I think we'll go for the second option initially (because that
pretty closely matches the homebrew locking scheme that it used to
use).

Yes, I think you're right, because there's no barriers or synchronisation
when attaching a new domain. Just a small point though:

This should probably be done like so?
#define for_each_domain(cpu, domain) \
	for (domain = rcu_dereference(cpu_rq(cpu)->sd); domain; domain = domain->parent)
And I think it would be wise to use rcu_assign_pointer in the update too.
Thanks Paul.
