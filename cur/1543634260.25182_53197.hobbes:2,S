Exactly.  The reason the behavior is odd is not because the sched_yield
task is getting any CPU, David.  I realize sched_yield is not equivalent
to blocking.
The reason this behavior is suspect is because the task is receiving a
similar amount of CPU to tasks that are _not_ yielding but in fact doing
useful work for the entire duration of their timeslice.
A task that continually uses its timeslice vs one that yields should
easily receive a greater amount of CPU, but this is not the case.
As someone who works in the scheduler, this points out that sched_yield
is, well, broken.  First guess would be it is queuing to the front of
the runqueue (it once did this but I thought it was fixed) or otherwise
exhausting the timeslice wrong.
Someone pointed out this bug existed similarly in 2.5, although it was a
bit different.  2.5 has a different (and better, imo) sched_yield
implementation that tries to overcome certain shortcomings and also
perform optimally and fairly.
