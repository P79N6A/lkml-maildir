Surely two reallocations wouldn't have made it run out of spare space?
Besides, the S.M.A.R.T. log didn't have any statistics anywhere near
failure, and if the drive had run out of spare space then surely one or two
of the statistics should have gone down to zero.

Yeah, but it's not even quite clear if the reallocated sector is the same as
the defective sector.  Something is pretty screwy, and I've asked some
friends at Toshiba to discuss it during their next visit (and they know
they're getting cat food instead of my wife's cooking  _^o^_)  Nonetheless,
it is customary to dump drives when they have increasingly numerous defects,
not when they have one.

I think you mean that the replacement sector might have gone bad in the
minutes after the reallocation.  Unlikely but possible, yes.  I guess I will
probably try to write zeroes to the sector using the suggestion by Maciej
Zenczykowski, but first I'll ask the Toshiba people if they have different
preferences.

It's not obvious if the reallocated sector was the same one as the detected
defective sector.  I thought it seemed not to be.  You pointed out that it
is unlikely but possible.

OK, sorry I thought you just hadn't read what you were replying to.

Yeah, but I was already upset by finding that the same sector number
remained bad even after it "should" have been the one that was reallocated.
