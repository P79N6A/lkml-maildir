I would have expected it to actually do increase savings due to avoiding
the cost of bringing the CPU back from deep NAP mode too often. It's
possible that my previous experiments were bogus in fact. It would be
very useful to have some statistics on how long we _actually_ sleep, I
supspect things like the network stack with all it's slow timer all
kicking at slightly different times for example are screwing us up a
little bit.
