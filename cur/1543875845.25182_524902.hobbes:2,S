I, for one, not upset. On the contrary.
IMHO gcc should be smart enough to optimize that code properly with that 
"= NULL" added. 
BTW with gcc 4.1.2 on x86_64 that warning doesn't get emitted, and it 
generates the same exact code with or without " = NULL". One could aruge,
if people are upset about more code being generated because they use an 
older stable branch of gcc, it's _their_ problem.

If there was such 'squash_bogus_uninit_warning' macro exist and in use,
then this could have been a possible scenario:
  A) There's some 200-lines long function.
  B) It has a squash_bogus_uninit_warning() somewhere in the beginning.
  C) Someone commits a patch that uses an uninitialized variable on _some_
     cases and it doesn't generate a warning.
  D) You get an 'heisenbug', since that pointer might point to something
     that is dereferencable without a fault, etc.
I think that warnings of these kind (assuming that they are not generated
as a result of deficiencies in the latest stable version of gcc) exist
for a damn good reason - the code should be fixed and that warning 
shouldn't be bypassed in semi-nasty ways.
