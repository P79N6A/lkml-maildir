Sorry, I tried to cross-post this originally but I had a typo in the
address.  Anyway, here is the announcement for the SDM.

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Developer Manual for the Intel PRO/1000 Gigabit
Ethernet controllers is available
To: netdev@vger.kernel.org, LKML <inux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
At long last the software developers manual for the Intel PRO/1000
Gigabit Ethernet controllers is now available on our Sourceforge web
site.  The URL is: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/e1000
The manual covers all of the PCI/PCI-X controllers supported by the
e1000 driver.  We will be following this release up with another
manual which covers our PCI-Express controllers.
I know lots of people have been waiting for this so enjoy.  :-)

Cheers,
John
