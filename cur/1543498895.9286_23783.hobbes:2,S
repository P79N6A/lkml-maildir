Well, it's degraded a little bit.  I've tried 2.2.5 to 2.2.9, and none
of them will get beyond "Freeing unused kernel memory...".  I'm not sure
what RH did to their kernel, but the RH stock kernel is the only 2.2.x
kernel that successfully boots on that machine.
Certainly *somebody* has an idea about what's going on, or how to debug
this...
