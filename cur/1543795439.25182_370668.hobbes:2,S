That's what 2.6.15-rc2 reports for my input devices:
stiffy:/var/cache/apt/archives# dmesg | grep input
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input0
input: PC Speaker as /class/input/input1
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse as /class/input/input2
drivers/usb/input/usbmouse.c: v1.6:USB HID Boot Protocol mouse driver
