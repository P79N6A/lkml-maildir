As a data point, I have traces of a scanner session including a
download of a 26Mb binary image using 524288 bytes logical blocks
physically transferred with 61440 bytes bulk_in frames.  Seems stable
enough.  IIRC the scanner-side controller chip has some advanced
buffering just to handle that kind of bandwidth.
ISTR a preliminary linux userland driver using libusb having problems
keeping up with the scanner too.  May very well have been an issue
with the driver itself though, so I wouldn't read too much into that.
  OG.
