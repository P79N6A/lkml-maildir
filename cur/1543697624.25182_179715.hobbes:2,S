Right... but non-privileged users _can't_ delete these extra links, even 
if they notice them from the link count.  And non-idiots do make 
security errors -- they just fix them.  But in this case, fixing the 
error after the fact may be impossible without root's help.
And how many package managers / install scripts check for hard links of 
files they're about to overwrite?
