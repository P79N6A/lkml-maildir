False positive. Memory reclaim can inverts the order of iprune_mutex and
the normal inode locking orders. i.e. Both of these are possible:
	do_something()
	enter memory reclaim
	iprune_mutex
	inode lock
or
	do_something()
	inode lock
	do_something_else
	enter memory reclaim
	iprune_mutex
	inode lock on different inode
So depending on what is seen first (in this case the first), the second
will trip lockdep. Neither are a deadlock, because the inode lock
held before memory reclaim is a referenced inode and will *never* be
on the free list for memory reclaim to deadlock on....
Cheers,
Dave.
