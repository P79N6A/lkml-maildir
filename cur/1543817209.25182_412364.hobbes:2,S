The error is: rpc.mountd: getfh failed: Operation not permitted
In order to fix this error, someone needs to run these commands on each 
nfs server.
    40  service nfs stop
    41  rm -f /var/lib/nfs/etab /var/lib/nfs/rmtab /var/lib/nfs/state 
/var/lib/xtab
    42  touch /var/lib/nfs/etab /var/lib/nfs/rmtab /var/lib/nfs/state 
/var/lib/xtab
    43  chmod 644 /var/lib/nfs/etab /var/lib/nfs/rmtab /var/lib/nfs/state 
/var/lib/xtab
    44  service nfs start

This issue seems to be more of an NFS issue than a kernel one, but I was 
wondering what other people had to say about it.  There are a lot of 
responses and questions concerning this error on google, but VERY few 
people have a response or method of fixing it, much less finding a 
permanent fix.
Has anyone found a fix or work-around that does not require restarting 
NFS?
Please CC as I am not on either list.
Thanks,
Justin.
