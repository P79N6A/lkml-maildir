Hello, 
I have some confusions on kernel_thread, so I want to get help.
I want to create a thread in a loadable module, then I used the function
kernel_thread() in init_module(). Of course, the thread was created, but when I
remove the module there are errors. I think it is because of the thread I have
created that have not been killed. So, how can I kill this thread when I remove
the module?
Thanks,
