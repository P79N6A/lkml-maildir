Let me reiterate two facts:
(1)  The various C standards state that the implementation should  
restrict itself to symbols prefixed with "__", everything else is  
reserved for user code (Including symbols prefixed with a single  
underscore).
(2)  GCC predefines a large collection of symbols, macros, and  
functions for its own use, and this set is not constant (just look at  
the number of new __-prefixed symbols added between GCC 3 and 4.  In  
addition, we're not just compiling this code under GCC, but people  
will also be using it (hopefully unmodified) under tiny-cc, intel-cc,  
PGI, PathScale, Lahey, ARM Ltd, lcc, and possibly others.  It  
probably does not need to be stated that for something as userspace- 
sensitive as the KABI headers we should not risk colliding with  
predefined builtins in any of those compilers.
So my question to the list is this:
Can you come up with any way other than using a "__kabi_" prefix to  
reasonably avoid namespace collisions with that large list of  
compilers?  If you have some way, I'd be interested to hear it, but  
as a number of those compilers are commercial I'd have no way to test  
on them (and I suspect most people on this list would not either).
Of course, if the general consensus is that supporting non-GCC is not  
important, then that's ok with me.  Judging from the number of  
negative responses my earlier "[OT] Non-GCC compilers used for linux  
userspace" got, however, that doesn't seem to be the case.
Thanks for the advice!
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
