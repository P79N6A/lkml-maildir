Well that patch fixed a real bug.  It abviously added or exposed another
one though.  
I continue to wonder if that task_struct is scrogged.  There seem to be no
other processes holding the lock.
Might be interesting to give the below patch a run with memory debug
enabled.
Also spinlock debugging enabled.  It would be nice to run with preempt and
sleep-in-spinlock debugging enabled too, but I think preempt is broken on
NUMA?
(Anton had a patch which just enabled the beancounting which is needed for
might_sleep() effectiveness without turning on preempt, but it needs more
work for ia32)
