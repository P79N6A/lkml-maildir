Interactive response is actually pretty OK, the only thing I'm seeing is
short (about 1 sec) pauses, they could be due to network problems or VM
stuff...
hard to say because I work with the machine over the net and not from
console.
What I do see during these short pauses is that sendq is building up on the
remote end, nothing happens for a short while and then things continue as
nothing bad happened ;)
It feels like a subtle problem, nothing terribly wrong, but the system does
not feel
100% OK either. Be it a networking or a VM-problem.

This goes on and on, long periods of zero idle time and then a short period
with some idle time and some more cs, the "short pauses" are (when they
happen to occur) just before or slightly after the period with more context
switches.

Btw..the box is a PII-450 so it's not terribly slow ;)

As always, I'm happy to provide you with more information if I can!
