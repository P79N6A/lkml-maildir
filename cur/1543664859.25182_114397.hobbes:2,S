I want to uncompress it to a different address (actually to a MM5451 card), so that I can test the low memory. Yes my boot loader loads the compressed kernel to 0x200000, and I have modified the kernel to uncompress it and execute it from 0x200000. However I am having problems trying to execute it!!

Why would you need to uncompress it to a different address? You mention
that your bootloader does something odd, but that should only affect the
address of the compressed bzImage, not the decompressed kernel ...
