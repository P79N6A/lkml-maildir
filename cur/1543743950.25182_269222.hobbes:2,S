I want to get this clear:
Every older guest UML kernel will hang on exit on 2.6.9 hosts from now
on, and there's nothing to fix it but to update the guest UML patches?
This is a nasty limitation in general - because it means that on the
update to 2.6.9, every kernel binary needs to be updated - and finding
rock solid versions of kernels + UML patches is not a fast process.
