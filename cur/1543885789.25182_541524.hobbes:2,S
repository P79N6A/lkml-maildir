Eric,
With the latest change that make vmlinux to be elf64 and make bzImage
do switch to 64bit long mode, the kernel started via kexec can not get
VGA console. but the serial console works well. I wonder if the
setup.S is skipped in bzImage via kexec path.
or i missed sth?
#!/bin/bash
./kexec -t bzImage -l bzImage_2.6.22_k8.1 --command-line="apic=debug
acpi_dbg_level=0x00000007 pci=routeirq snd-hda-intel.enable_msi=1
ramdisk_size=65536 root=/dev/ram0 rw ip=dhcp console=tty0
console=ttyS0,9600n8" --ramdisk=mydisk8_x86_64.gz
