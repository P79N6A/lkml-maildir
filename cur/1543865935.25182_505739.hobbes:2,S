Having an error handling compatibility that is backwards compatible sounds
interesting.

Yes.  Although when you think sections instead of segments I'm a little
worried.

I think as HPA points out we have gotten past that a long time
ago with the bzImage format.
With the right delicacy, and preserving backwards compatibility
with existing bootloaders I think we can achieve things.
The big issue is that sometimes bootloaders are a little bit brittle.
