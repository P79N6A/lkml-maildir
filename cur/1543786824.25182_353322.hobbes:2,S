So far the current NTFS code worked fine with Longhorn/Vista releases.
WinFS and TxFS (transactional NTFS) are on top of current NTFS and MS
engineers claim that they work hard to avoid on-disk NTFS format changes.

Several people reported these and Anton is investigating it.

Anybody [keep] confirming that the current Linux NTFS code still works 
on the latest Vista beta releases would be highly encouraging for all

The latest ntfsprogs CVS has also these changes and every tool should work
fine with Vista (ntfscp, ntfsresize, ntfsundelete, ntfsclone, etc).
