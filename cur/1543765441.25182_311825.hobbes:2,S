 	The bug is in this portion of code from net/sched/sch_generic.c, 
in the qdisc_destroy() function:
==
      list_for_each_entry(cq, &cql, list)
           list_for_each_entry_safe(q, n, &qdisc->dev->qdisc_list, list)
                if (TC_H_MAJ(q->parent) == TC_H_MAJ(cq->handle)) {
                     if (q->ops->cl_ops == NULL)
                          list_del_init(&q->list);
                     else
                          list_move_tail(&q->list, &cql);
                }
      list_for_each_entry_safe(cq, n, &cql, list)
           list_del_init(&cq->list);
==
 	...and it happens when q->ops->cl_ops is NULL and 
list_del_init(&q->list) is executed.
 	The stuff from include/linux/list.h looks ok, it seems like one 
of those two iterations (list_for_each_entry() and 
list_for_each_entry_safe()) enters an endless loop when an element is 
removed from the list under some circumstances.
