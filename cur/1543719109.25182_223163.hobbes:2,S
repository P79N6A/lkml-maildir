Subject: vfat case corruption with utf8

Hi,
When I mount a vfat filesystem and create files, the case of the files
changes after creation. I am using Fedora FC2 with kernel 2.6.5. I
have created a script that demonstrates the problem (see below).
I originally filed a bug with fedora about it, and it turns out that
the problem occurs on systems that default to utf8. There is a FIXME
comment in fs/fat/inode.c:1025. Mounting with iocharset=iso8859-1
works around the problem, but given that more systems seem to be going
to utf8, this is something that more people will be banging up
against.
Cheers,
Len.

if [ -f vfatmount/F00/test ]; then
  echo "Test file is visible"
else
  echo "ERROR: test file is not visible"
fi
# This action changes the naming of the directory!!
ls -l vfatmount/
# Check test file again (this time it fails)
if [ -f vfatmount/F00/test ]; then
  echo "Test file is visible"
else
  echo "ERROR: test file is not visible"
fi
# Cleanup
umount vfatfile
rm -r vfatfile vfatmount
