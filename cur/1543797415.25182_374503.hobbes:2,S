I just got three of these in the kernel ring buffer, (simultaneous with 
something weird happening):
	Machine check events logged
	Machine check events logged
	Machine check events logged
Logged where?
I seem to remember there being a daemon that grabs and logs these, but don't 
remember what it is. Google didn't help.
Can anyone enlighten me?
