I've now tracked the problem to the introduction of the new mtrr code, and
backing it out for 2.5.32 restores original performance.  From what I can 
tell, the new code is not handling a bios/hardware bug that the old code 
was.
The old mtrr code says this during bootup:
 mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent fixed MTRR settings
 mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent variable MTRR settings
 mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs
While the new code just says:
 mtrr: SMP support incomplete for this vendor
The peformance hit is basically the same as when the old mtrr code is 
disabled.  I'll have a poke around and see if I can find out why the new 
mtrr code isn't handling the problem.
