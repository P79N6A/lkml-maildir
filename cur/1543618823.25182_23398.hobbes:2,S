Hm, maybe you should shortly state which vendor (OEM or the like) you are
using. I generally cannot confirm any problems with tulip-driver in 2.4.
I use a wide variety of cards including 4 port cards, very old 21041 DLink,
the former DFE-series etc.
Maybe this is a specific problem with a certain vendor or board type?
