It _can_ be solved - rebooting cures it, so assuming the problem
is autodetectable it _can_ be solved by doing whatever it is
a reboot (or driver reload) does to the APIC.
My guess is that the APIC setup for that IRQ have to be reprogrammed.
you could do that as a quirk for the BP6. 
The first question is if there is a reliable way to detect this
condition.  "No interrupts from a device" could simply mean that
it isn't used much at the time.  You get a unexpected IRQ trap - do
the problem always manifest itself this way?
The second question is if all the PCI card drivers out there
survive a lost interrupt handled outside the driver.  
If not, you have to close+reopen the device, and that involves
userspace.
A network card will need reinitialization, a disk controller
remounting...
