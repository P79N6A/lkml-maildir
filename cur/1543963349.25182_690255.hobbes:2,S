Subject: [Patch 0/9] Fix resource leaks for exec related stuffs

This patchset contains various fixes for fs/binfmt_*.c, fs/{exec, compat}.c.
Most of them are aimed to fix resource leaks in failure path. Others
are bug fixes in failure path.
All patches are tested on UML, except [5/9] and [6/9], since I don't have
the desired environment to test them. It should be OK since [4/9] is the
similar fix.
