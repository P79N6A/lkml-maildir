2.6.9 contains a large update to the connectiontracking code. One thing
that was changed is that it now verifies the checksum of tcp and udp
packets. I know of at least one user who has been bitten by this and what
looks like a broken sungem NIC.
Could you please try this:
modprobe ipt_LOG
echo 255 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_log_invalid
Then try again and then check the kernellog by executing 'dmesg', see if
it complains about bad checksums.
