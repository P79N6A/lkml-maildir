Well, we're doing exactly this for non-initramfs initrd, however, it
would definitely be cleaner just to overmount rootfs with a tmpfs before
extraction -- it's an absolutely trivial amount of code; the biggest
complexity would be spotting the kernel command line option to invoke it.
Yet another variant, which works on existing kernels, is to have a
nested cpio, where your rootfs consists of a trivial /init which mounts
tmpfs and extracts another tar- or cpioball.
