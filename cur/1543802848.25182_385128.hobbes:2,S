send in the information from "hciconfig -a" for this device, because
this is a hardware bug and you can't be sure that you can have eight
outstanding SCO packets.
I personally prefer to implement this as a quirk which can be activated
by the driver. Once I have seen the device information, I will think
about how we might deal with it.

Marcel
