This looks interesting... as you alredy told this driver derives from
an older one, I just maintained it till now.
If I well understand I should remove usb_ep_autoconfig() and program
into the controller only one (the default) configuration. Is that
right?
Currently I tested the driver only with ether gadget, but if I do as
above, should I get the driver working with all gadgets automagically?
:)
Thanks a lot,
Rodolfo
