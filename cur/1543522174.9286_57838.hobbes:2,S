Let's avoid loaded words like "lying".  Yes, ORBS's own FAQ isn't as clear
as it should be, and its author has a chip on his shoulder.  But the
data he provides is clearly labelled; when you look up an address,
it tells you clearly whether it was scanned or not, and if so, whether there
was an open relay there.  That's about as close to their original mission
statement as I can imagine coming.
Now, assuming that ORBS makes its FAQ clearer, I assume that you still won't
use their service, since you seem a bit negative on ORBS.  But would you use 
it if it were modified by my proposal?  Alan Cox seems to think it would 
reduce the number of false positives.
btw, hats off to Rahul Dhesi for his objective FAQ on the subject,
