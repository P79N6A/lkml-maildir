Ie, something like the attached minimal patch to modinfo that just supresses 
the author= tag from the default output; the information is still available 
from modinfo -a.
However. Looking at the MODULE_AUTHOR tags in the tree:
rene@7ixe4:~/src/linux/local$ grep -r MODULE_AUTHOR * | wc -l
2211
more than half of them already don't provide an email address:
rene@7ixe4:~/src/linux/local$ grep -r "MODULE_AUTHOR(.*<.*>.*)" * | wc -l
1088
Alan is one of the people using just MODULE_AUTHOR("Alan Cox") without an 
address. Given that the email address is all that I want to supress; how 
about just deleting that instead?
I'd prefer that; unlike the name, the adress is information that can get 
outdated and moreover, removing the address not only from the modinfo output 
but from the source directly means it can't be mistaken for a contact 
address there either.
Comments? Objections? If none, I'll start submitting patches removing email 
addresses from the MODULE_AUTHOR tags in the tree.
Rene.
