...but why are you needing to call vfs_mkdir? I thought the standard
cachefs backend just uses a pool of files, rather like the original AFS
cache did. Are you trying to mirror the layout and the permissions of
the NFS filesystem? That is a lot more work than it is worth...

To what end? These files shouldn't need to be made visible to userland
at all.
