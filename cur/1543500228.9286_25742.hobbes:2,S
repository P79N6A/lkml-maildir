Hello Felix,
I agree with your points and comments but disagree with your suggestions
to fix them. All of your suggestions can be compactified into a single
simple rule - if you see something wrong - fix it.
Things are wrong not because the big guys are not smart enough but because
they are busy doing the really important things. Therefore, people like
you and me ought to help them out with small things like the ones you
mentioned. Furthermore, thank them that they actually spend their valuable
times reading our emails and applying our patches rather than just saying
"it is too simple to be even worth my attention" (which I would probably
do if I was in their place :)
Regards,
Tigran
