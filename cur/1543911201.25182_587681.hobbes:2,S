There are two standard objections to this:
    - direct reclaim was introduced to reduce memory allocation latency,
      and going to scheduler kills this. But more importantly,
    - it might so happen that _all_ per-cpu kswapd instances are
      blocked, e.g., waiting for IO on indirect blocks, or queue
      congestion. In that case whole system stops waiting for IO to
      complete. In the direct reclaim case, other threads can continue
      zone scanning.
