This doesnt work. The DMA is direct, PCI DMA doesnt take page faults, 
only CPU's do that. For sane cards do overlay mode, for stupid cards you
have to bounce the entire thing, you end up doing a two buffer

loop.
With ISA cards don't bother. You'll get 5-10fps at best even at low resolution.
You'd be better off reverse engineering an old DOS era cards drivers and
writing a feature connector mode card driver for something like the original
full length hauppauge card
