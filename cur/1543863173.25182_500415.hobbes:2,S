It is true, but the point is not "modern" vs "ancient" OS, it's "multitasking"
vs "monotasking" kernel. If your program does the busy loop, you'll get a
very high accuracy at the expense of burning watts polling one bit one
billion times a second waiting for a change every millisecond.
18 years ago, I wrote a soft-only 8250 emulator to connect my second 8088
to the first one's serial port at 19200 bauds. At this time, waiting for
a change only took a few hundred cycles and the busy loop was the default
mode of the OS anyway. Things have changed since.
