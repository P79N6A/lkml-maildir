Yes, It usually happens either under high load, when mouse interrupts are
significantly delayed. Or sometimes it happen when applications poll
battey status and on some boxes it takes pretty long time. And because
it is usually the same chip that serves keyboard/mouse it again delays
mouse interrupts.
Btw, what kind of laptop/touchpad is that?
