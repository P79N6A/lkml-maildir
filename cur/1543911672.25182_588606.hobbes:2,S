Hello again.
I have the following code:
========================================
clock_t c_sum, j, p;
cputime_t j_tmp;
...
c_sum = cputime64_to_clock_t(task->utime) +
cputime64_to_clock_t(task->stime);
cur_j = jiffies;
j_tmp =  jiffies64_to_cputime64(cur_j);
j = cputime64_to_clock_t(j_tmp);
p = (c_sum * 100) / j;
========================================
And if I check the p value of a certain process it gives wrong results.
For example for a process using 99% of the CPU it shows 20. What am I
doing wrong?
Greets,
Luka
