Hi,
it seems that PCI quirks are not handled on resume which results
in all kinds of strange effects, like disappeared PCI devices.
Below is a diff between "lspci -vvvxxx" before and after resume
for my SMBus device which only gets enabled by PCI quirk handling.

Besides that, a number of drivers do not restore the pci config
space of their associated devices properly on resume from S3.
These drivers (and associated devices) are:
- intel_agp (Host bridge: Intel Corp. 82855PM Processor to I/O Controller)
- ? (PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 82855PM Processor to AGP Controller)
- uhci_hcd (USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) USB UHCI Controller)
- ? (PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 82801 PCI Bridge)
- ? (ISA bridge: Intel Corp. 82801DBM LPC Interface Controller)
- piix_ide (IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82801DBM (ICH4) Ultra ATA Storage Controller)
Diff between "lspci -vvvxxx" before and after resume for all
problematic devices on my machine is attached.
Are there any patches I can try?
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
