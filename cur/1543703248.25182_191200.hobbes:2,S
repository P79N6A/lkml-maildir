That flush_cache_range was removed between 2.5.67 and 2.5.68.  If you put
it back, does it fix the problem?
It seems from Russell's words here, MIPS should be flushing in
tlb_start_vma().
I think that's wrong, really.  We've discussed this before and decided that
these flushing operations should be open-coded in the main .c file rather
than embedded in arch functions which happen to undocumentedly do other
stuff.

# [PATCH] flush_cache_mm in zap_page_range
# 
# unmap_vmas() eventually calls tlb_start_vma(), where most architectures
# flush caches as necessary.  The flush here seems to make the
# flush_cache_range() in zap_page_range() redundant, and therefore can be
# removed.
