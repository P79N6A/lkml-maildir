OK, never mind.  I think the patch below is the right fix.

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
The APM emulation is currently broken as a result of commit
831441862956fffa17b9801db37e6ea1650b0f69
"Freezer: make kernel threads nonfreezable by default"
that removed the PF_NOFREEZE annotations from apm_ioctl() without adding
the appropriate freezer hooks.  Fix it and remove the unnecessary variable flags
from apm_ioctl().
