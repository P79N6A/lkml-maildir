hi,
I am writing a driver for 2.6 in which i am locking down some pages
into the physical memory by manually traversing the page tables. After
my work with those pages is finished, i free them using 
__free_page(). For some cases it is running fine. But while running
some applications, i got the following error:
Bad page state at free_hot_cold_page (in process 'data_lat', page
0000010003d208e8)
flags:0x01000074 mapping:0000000000000000 mapcount:0 count:0
Backtrace:
Call Trace:<ffffffff801571f7>{bad_page+112}
<ffffffff801578cf>{free_hot_cold_page+130}
       <ffffffffa01aa101>{:ccp3k:VipkUnmapAndUnlock+162}

       <ffffffff8011003e>{system_call+126}
Trying to fix it up, but a reboot is needed
Then i replaced __free_page() with page_cache_release(). It is working
fine now. But what is the difference between these two? whether this
is the correct/safe replacement for __free_page()?
Can anybody help me out in this scenario? My machine is intel
xeon(EM64T) dual processor with redhat enterprise linux 4(2.6.9-11)
running on it.
if anybody knows any link about it, let me share that.
Thanks,
Yogeshwar
