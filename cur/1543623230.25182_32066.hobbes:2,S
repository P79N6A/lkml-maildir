Ordered tags just specify ordering in the command stream.  The WCE bit
specifies when the write command is complete.  I have never heard of
any implied requirement to flush to media when a drive receives an
ordered tag and WCE is set.  It does seem like a useful feature to have
in the standard, but I don't think it's there.
So if one vendor implements those semantics, but the others don't where
does that leave us?
