Hello all,
regarding DFE-580TX I have some additions:
1) the 2.4.20-pre5 included sundance.c does not work at all with a recent
Dlink-card, the interface statistics show complete garbage and there is no
link possible.
2) The dlink driver Ryan points to does not handle mixed 10- and 100-MBit
configuration. 100 MBit wins, 10 Mbit gives no link.
3) Donalds' drivers (www.scyld.com) cannot be statically linked with the
kernel, there are dups in pci-scan.c and the current 2.4 kernel.
=>
1) In fact I wouldn't buy DFE-580TX today if I had a real chance of finding a 4
port tulip-driven card...
2) For 2.4-kernel something should be done, because currently the situation is
a mess.
Regards,
Stephan
