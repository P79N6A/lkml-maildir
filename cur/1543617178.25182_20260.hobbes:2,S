Let's get the terminology right here (for x86 at least):
Far jump: Changes to a new code segment, absolute address
Near jump: Same code segment, 4-byte relative offset
Short jump: Same code segment, 1-byte signed offset
The kernel never uses far jumps except for some BIOS calls and during
booting.  The difference betwen near and short jumps is very minute. 
Short jumps are limited to +/- 128 bytes, so are really only applicable
for small loops.  All function calls between object files must be near
jumps, as the assembler does not not know the distance of an unresolved
symbol and must assume the largest possible offset.
