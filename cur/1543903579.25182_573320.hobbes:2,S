I did not mention it in my previous message, but I made a few
different compilation of Linux, also with that option (compiled
directly to the kernel and as a module). And it did not work. But, to
be sure I recompiled kernel again with CONFIG_PATA_MPIIX=y and it did
not work. So, if the controller is supported, where is the problem?
