Even if root must have CAP_SETFCAP, you can avoid giving anyone that
power. The solution is very simple:
root:*:0:0:root:/:/dev/null

It is totally insecure on a heterogeneous network.
The setuid bit works great. Execution on older kernels can be optionally
prevented by mangling the header.

That is an odd bit of FUD.
Modern distributions can install with /usr being an NFS mount.
People expect that a backup and restore will not destry normal system
operation. If caps conflict with those, they will seldom be used.
