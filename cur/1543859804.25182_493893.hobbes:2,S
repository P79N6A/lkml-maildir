I've altered your patch to do the spin_lock_irqsave in down_read.
I am very ignorant and stupid. That's why I am doing it without
thinking why or why not de irqsave is ok in that region or not.
And the results are:
include/asm-i386/ide.h ide_default_io_base(): blaat: interrupts were disabled@49
include/asm-i386/ide.h ide_default_io_base(): blaat: interrupts were disabled@51
include/asm-i386/ide.h ide_default_io_base(): blaat: interrupts were disabled@59
Meaning: it works.
Repeating: I am very stupid, so I don't know if saving the irq state is ok or
not in down_read.
