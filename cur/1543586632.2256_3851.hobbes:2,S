It will. Linux 2.4.x still hasn't had the scsi disk block size bugs fixed.
Stick to 2.2.19.

M/O disks are slow. At a minimum make sure you are using a physical block size
of 2048 bytes when using 2048 byte media and plenty of memory to cache stuff
when reading. Seek times on M/O media are pretty poor
