Subject: [GIT PATCH] sysfs fixes for 2.6.22-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some sysfs fixes for 2.6.22-rc4
They are based on a set of patches from Tejun that have been in the -mm
tree for a while and fix a nasty sysfs problem that people have been
hitting in the real world (Google has hit this a lot and spent a lot of
time and effort in tracking this down, I'd really like to say thanks for
the help here.)
Tejun and Eric have backported a small set of patches that fix this for
your current tree, with the larger, more intrusive patches queued up for
after 2.6.22 is out.
Tejun and I have beat on these patches a lot and have not found any
problems.  I know it's late in the series for them, but under the
circumstances, it seems reasonable.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
