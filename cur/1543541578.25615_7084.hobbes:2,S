That IS a problem. If I use tar to backup a directory, it will be missing
bits out. That's bad.
Then we get to moving files. My program copies what it sees as "the file"
(which is really just one of the data attributes), then deletes "the file"
(which eliminates all of them). Bang - data loss. Not good.

On the contrary: they WILL break.

True (still not convinced we need S_IFCOMPLEX, though).

In short, there's still a BIG problem. Using mv etc. will cause data loss,
and tar will miss data out. Not good.
