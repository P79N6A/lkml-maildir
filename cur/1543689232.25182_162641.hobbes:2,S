`make modules_install` executes depmod to create some entries in the
new /lib/modules/$(VERSION)/modules.dep. It probably should have
it's error output redirected to /dev/null because the kernel you
are going to use the modules with, may not require the exported
symbols found missing.

This is a different problem and has nothing to do with:
 *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.22/kernel/net/ipv4/ipip.o
You need to review your configuration and see what else needs
to be turned ON to get ACPI to work.
`grep ACPI .config`... Bet it's "CONFIG_ACPI is not set"
