Hi readers of linux-kernel and glibc maintainers,
while hacking on a network application I found following oddity:
poll(pds,nfds,timeout) called with one of the file descriptors listed in
pds being invalid always does return nfds.
Output of appended sample code:
poll returned 2
revent[0]: 0
revent[1]: 32
According to IEEE Std 1003.1, 2003 Edition, the return value should have
been 1 in the above sample.
The kernel is 2.4.20 (debian 2.4.20-3-686). After a short look at the
code for sys_poll I am certain the problem is originated within the
kernel.
Any suggestions which actions to take?
Michael
Simple sample code demonstrating the problem:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/poll.h>
struct pollfd fds[] = {
 { 0, POLLIN, 0 },
 { 110, POLLIN, 0}
};
int main(void)
{
	int r = poll(fds, sizeof fds / sizeof fds[0], -1);
	if ( r < 0 )
		perror("poll");
	else
		printf("poll returned %d\n");
	for ( r=0; r < sizeof fds / sizeof fds[0]; r++ )
		printf("revent[%d]: %hd\n", r, fds[r].revents);
	return 0;
}
