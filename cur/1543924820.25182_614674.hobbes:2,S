Hello Kernel-Developer,
Module quickcam_messenger seems to be broken (tried 2.6.18 and 2.6.22)
on 2 different NSLU2 (ARM). Picture is attached. Same kernel and module 
can be used without any problems on x86 here. I don't have any ARM 
device beside the NSLU2, so I cannot check.
The solution was to use Christian Magnusson's quickcam module. 
Everything worked without any problem. Webcam is:
Bus 003 Device 005: ID 046d:08f0 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Messenger
Best regards and thanks for your work!
Markus
