yes, but that only affects the io_context reference count. Actual new 
use of tsk->io_context should only be possible on the IO-submission 
side, which should all have stopped by the time we execute do_exit().  
(and it's synchronous anyway, so the fact that we are executing in the 
kernel prevents the same thread from submitting new IO, in this case.)
i.e. the removal of tsk->io_context can be done without locking out 
interrupts. No interrupt or io_context is supposed to access 
current->io_context at that point.

i think it should be mostly safe already - it seems to be overlocking a 
bit. E.g. the read_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock) could be a simple 
read_lock() i think.
