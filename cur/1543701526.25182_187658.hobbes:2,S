Hi,
Since I upgraded to 2.6.1-rc1-ben1 (BenH tree), modem hangups using USB
phone (cdc-acm) cause ohci-hcd to disable itself:
# killall -HUP pppd && tail /var/log/syslog
Jan  2 09:39:02 [pppd] Hangup (SIGHUP) 
Jan  2 09:39:02 [pppd] Connection terminated. 
Jan  2 09:39:02 [pppd] Connect time 0.5 minutes. 
Jan  2 09:39:02 [pppd] Sent 283 bytes, received 273 bytes. 
Jan  2 09:39:03 [kernel] ohci_hcd 0001:01:1b.0: OHCI Unrecoverable Error, 
disabled 
Jan  2 09:39:03 [pppd]Exit.
I built ohci-hcd as a module to be able to re-use USB devices without
rebooting (using rmmod && modprobe). 
It didn't do that with the last version I had, which was 2.6.0-test11-benh.
Happy new year to everyone,
