This seems to affect my Latitude C810 with the latest BIOS (A05).  When I
flashed to that version my linux system started handing at random spots.
Disabling CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC took care of the hangs, but I also lost all of
my battery status support (the batter would always say unknown).
I downgraded the system back to A04 and everything went back to normal.  So
I agree with this question, what's wrong with Dell's BIOS?  It seems that
whatever they do to get XP working breaks Linux badly.  I could complain,
but I'd need to be specific about what they are actually doing wrong.
Later,
Tom
