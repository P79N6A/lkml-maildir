Because I can't divine what's in your mind, and if you don't make the
points you want to make clear, I may very well fail to understand.

With the exception of those who choose not to distribute their
changes.  Or who choose to distribute their changes to people who are
not willing to share them with you.  Fair enough.

Yes.  It's there in the article as well.  The difference is basically
in attitude.  Tit-for-tat is adversarial (equivalent retaliation),
whereas Quid pro quo is cooperative (a favor for a favor).

Yup, I remember that.

And in what sense the GPLv3 anti-Tivoization clause doesn't?
In what sense does it give you *less* of what you want?
