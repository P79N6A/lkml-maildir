I don't have anything in -mm1, but heres a report, up about 23 hrs 
now.
Everything seems to be working fine, and one proggy I couldn't run 
before, now does, epsons iscan-1.5.2 front end for sane driven 
scanners now works.  The major thing I see in the logs is audio 
related, and has been carrying on since last summer.

I think that each of those is related to the little two tone noise I 
play when there is new incoming mail.  There's a couple of other 
non-show stoppers but thats the major log clutterer.  The only alsa 
is whats in the kernel, and with a couple of very minor exceptions, 
it all works.  No Ooops, lockups or anything like that.  All pretty 
smooth and interactive using anticipatory at the moment.
Merry Christmas Andrew!
