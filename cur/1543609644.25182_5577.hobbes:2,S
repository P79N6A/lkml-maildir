I have yet to try the latest kernels, but I have an Asus A7V133 (PC133,
not DDR) and a Tyan K7 Thunder (dual). Both are running 1.4GHz Athlons
and both have had problems. In both cases the IDE has been a problem. On
the Tyan, I've had to turn off DMA or it will lock up. I have not messed
with the Asus system yet to see exactly where the problem is.
I'm looking forward to seeing how a newer kernel works (I am running
2.4.9ac10 on my Tyan and a stock Red Hat 7.1 kernel on the Asus until I
upgrade it)
