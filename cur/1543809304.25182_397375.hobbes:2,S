As the maintainer of the cdrtools package and the author of both libscg and 
cdrecord I find it hard to believe that you do not have a log of these 
somewhere. If Debian had relevant data and removed it, then it is quite 
probable that they fixed the problem already. If that is the case, then all 
it should take to find out is making an enquiry or searching among their 
distribution specific kernel patches.
However, in the spirit of making this discussion bear useful fruit, I will 
take it upon myself to search the Debian archived bugs and see if I can find 
out the relevant data myself.
