Happens by itself due to biasing mixing blocks at lower PFNs. The exact
number is unknown. We used to track it a long time ago but not any more.

This is a possibility but Andrea seems confident he can handle it.

For what it's worth, the last allocation failure that occured with
grouping pages by mobility was order-1 atomic failures for a wireless
network card when bittorrent was running. You're likely right in that
torrents will be an interesting workload in terms of fragmentation.
