Help doesn't say anything about requiring v4l either.  Maybe this should be
fixed as well.
CONFIG_USB_CPIA
  Say Y here if you want to connect this type of camera to your
  computer's USB port.
  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cpia.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.
