IMHO gcc should not be touching these function calls, as they are not
made to a standard C library, and thus have different behaviors. I'm
suprised that gcc tries to optimize calls to these functions just
based on their names.
The gcc manpage mentions
       -ffreestanding
           Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding
           environment.  This implies -fno-builtin.  A freestand­
           ing environment is one in which the standard library
           may not exist, and program startup may not necessarily
           be at "main".  The most obvious example is an OS ker­
           nel.  This is equivalent to -fno-hosted.
Why is Linux not using this? It sounds very appropriate. The only
things the manpage mentions that -fno-builtin would inhibit from being
optimized are memcpy() and alloca(). memcpy() has its own assembly
optimization and inlining on some (most?) archs, and as for alloca(),
I only see it being used a bit in the S/390 code, where the gcc
optimizations could quite possibly break something. I think
-ffreestanding definately should be used by the kernel to prevent gcc
from messing with its code in broken ways.
