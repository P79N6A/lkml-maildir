Standard practice - its not IMHO so much trade secrets as "improving the
barrier to vendor change" 8). Pretty much all of the older PATA
controllers don't actually do hardware raid but bios/driver raid - ie
its the equivalent (or roughly so) of the md layer but locks you into
the vendor. The notable exception here is the 3ware card (there are a 
couple of others too - Promise Supertrak100, SX6000)
We know some of these formats (eg see the hptraid driver in 2.4.2x)

Plus little issues like the GPL 8)
