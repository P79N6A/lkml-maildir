CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_NAT help points to my website
 
http://www.csn.tu-chemnitz.de/HyperNews/get/linux-ip-nat.html
Thanks for the honor, but that's WRONG. (don't know who maintains it and
would like to warn the public, that's why I mail the list)
It should instead point to Alexey Kuznetsov's ftp site in Russia. His NAT
code, which is part of current 2.2 routing, has nothing to do with my
NAT module (which is not part of the mainstream kernel), and my ipnatadm
certainly won't help.
The link is ok if it's meant to point to geenral NAT info, but as it is it
implies that the implemantation that's available on my website is the one
one can enable here, which is not the case.
