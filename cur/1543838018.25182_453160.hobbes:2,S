Subject: [PATCH] XFS: remove pointless conditional testing 'nmp' vs NULL in fs/xfs/xfs_rtalloc.c::xfs_growfs_rt()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In fs/xfs/xfs_rtalloc.c::xfs_growfs_rt() there's a completely useless
conditional at the error_exit label.
The 'if (nmp)' check is pointless and might as well be removed for two 
reasons.
1) if 'nmp' is NULL then kmem_free() will end up calling kfree() with a NULL
   argument - which in turn will just cause a return from kfree(). No harm 
   done.
2) At the beginning of the function there's an assignment; '*nmp = *mp;' so
   if 'nmp' was NULL we'd already have blown up due to dereferencing a NULL 
   pointer.
This patch gets rid of the pointless check.
