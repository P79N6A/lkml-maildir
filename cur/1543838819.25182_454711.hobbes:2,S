Would it be usefull to notify the "resource" controller about this
change in limits? For ex: in case of the CPU controller I wrote 
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/4/9
), I was finding it usefull to recv
notification of changes to these limits, so that internal structures
(which are kept per-task-group) can be updated.
