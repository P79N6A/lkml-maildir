I want to be able to do two things:
- - To 'call_usermodehelper' a program, but in current's namespace.
Namespaces can't be passed around in userspace.
- - To give the execed program an open file.  The current interface
doesn't allow me to do that.
I figured the _cb way of doing it remove any need for adding ad-hoc api
anytime somebody wants to tweak a task before calling execve.
Does this clarify why I added this?
