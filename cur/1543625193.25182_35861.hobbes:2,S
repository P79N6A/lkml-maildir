Come on Pavel, in order to make this happen, you have to
	a) run the installer as root
	b) know the next pid which will be allocated
	c) put the symlink in /tmp/installer$pid
and do all before that pid gets used.  Have you actually be able to
do that?  I'd like to see how you did so without knowing exactly when
root was going to install the package and without filling up /tmp with
64,000 symlinks.
I'll grant you this is something we can trivially make go away as an 
issue, and we have, but it's mostly to make you go away as an issue,
not because we believe for one second this is a realistic problem.
