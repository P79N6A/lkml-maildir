Any chance you could pass down a struct writeback_control instead of
just the sync flag?  XFS always used ->writepage similar to the
->vm_writeback in older kernel releases because writing out more
than one page of delalloc space is really needed to be efficient and
this would allow us to get a few more hints about the VM's intentions.
