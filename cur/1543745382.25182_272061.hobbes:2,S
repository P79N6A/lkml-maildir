Do you have an answer for whether the behaviour of (a) is a bug or
not?  I don't know if it's a bug, or if that part of NPTL behaviour is
acceptable under POSIX.  Even if it's acceptable, you might decide
it's not acceptable quality to do that.
That answer affects my answer.

I think it's solvable in userspace.  I have a solution, but I'm tired
and will send it tomorrow.  This is just to let you know I'm looking
at the problem.
