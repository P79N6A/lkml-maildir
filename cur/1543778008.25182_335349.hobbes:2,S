Hi Tronic,
Supermount is obsolete there are other tools in userspace that do the
job perfectly.
e.g ivman which uses hal and dbus.
Including source like supermount because it simply work is not a good
argument. And why to hell should everthing in the kernel, to make
sorry *leazy* people happy? The kernel is not a trash...also
supermount uses ioctl which is nearly removed from kernel?! Please
correct me if i am wrong with ioctl.
Also there are other fs like supermount e.g submount etc...

I used supermount, too - for a long long time...but it cost me a
second to write a bash script with does supermount job's for eject.
