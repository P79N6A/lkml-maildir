There ya go, now this is reasonable.  Personally, I do not want to step on
your stones.

Yes, but not *entirely* good, because it is driving some developers into
isolation, or at the best, quiet resentment.  This does not qualify as 'best
for the kernel'.  A slight dose of moderation here would strike that happy
medium that seems to be slipping away.  No, not you, Larry, this is one of
your moderate moments, I think I am going to bronze this email.

Um, no Larry, but that is something we can discuss at our leisure.
Executive summary: life does not consist of business models alone.  Much
great art has nothing to do with business models.  Oh for sure, some
artists are fine businessmen but it's rare.  Usually they just get by,
enough to satisfy their immediate needs and produce immortal works for
your - our - pleasure.  Indeed, there is more to life that business models.

You don't *really* want me to do that.  I thought you had a business model.
Surely it does not consist of 'goad the open source community into replacing
my product with a better, free one, so I can retire in poverty'.

It would be most excellent, and you will get a case of good Berlin lager
out of it.  Err, maybe life is about business after all...
