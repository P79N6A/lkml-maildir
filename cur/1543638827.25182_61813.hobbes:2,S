My answer was:

To clarify, and to answer the question you actually asked, None of the modules
loaded were received as binary modules. I compiled them all myself from source
with this kernel's build tree. While the init.d scripts appear to use insmod
-f in fact the modules load just fine with insmod/modprobe without the -f.
