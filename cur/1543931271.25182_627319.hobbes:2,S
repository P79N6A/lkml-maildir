As far as I investigated in 2.6.24-rc5, only scsi uses the blk_queue_tag
and no files in drivers/scsi reserving tag_index in Scsi_Host->bqt.
So I would like to take the "absorbing start tag in the block layer" way.
The patch below is on top of the blk_end_request patch-set.
Is it acceptable?
Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH 31/31] blk_end_request: merge start_tag to block layer
This patch merges blk_queue_start_tag() into blkdev_dequeue_request().
blk_queue_start_tag() and blk_queue_end_tag() are a pair of
interfaces for starting/ending request tagging.
Since with the new blk_end_request interfaces, blk_queue_end_tag()
is done implicitly in the block layer, blk_queue_start_tag() should
be done in the block layer, too, for keeping the interface symmetric.
Originally, the start/end tag was not done by the block layer so that
drivers can choose tag numbers for their specific meanings.
But no driver uses the feature.
Scsi is the only user of the block layer tagging and it uses
the generic blk_queue_start/end_tag.
So moving the start/end tag to the block layer is not an issue now.
