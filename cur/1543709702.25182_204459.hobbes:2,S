Same here:
Mar  4 01:01:06 darkside kernel: hde: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
Mar  5 01:02:00 darkside kernel: hde: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
Mar  6 01:10:22 darkside kernel: hde: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
Can you somehow correlate this to start of S.M.A.R.T selftests?
I suspect it having something to do with 2.4.25 new "One last
read after the timeout" in ide-iops.c and accessing the drive
while selftest running (possibly especially short selftest).
Here, daily at 01:00 smartmontools runs smart short selftests
and a bit later the machine hangs.
Today, I disabled that job and the machine stays stable.

Dito... PDC20269 U133TX2
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW=y
And until now it was always hde connected to the promise
controller.

My machine did run at least since:
Jan 18 09:41:21 darkside kernel: Linux version 2.4.24
...
Feb 28 01:43:48 darkside kernel: Linux version 2.4.24
Feb 28 04:58:47 darkside kernel: Linux version 2.4.25
First time the problem occured was Mar  4 01:01:06.
smartmontools last update was at Feb 14 03:04
regards,

That's nothing. If you play it forwards, it installs NT.
