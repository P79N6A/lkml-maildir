No, not quite. Peter Staubach mentioned an issue in my solution:

These changes catch the simple case, where the file is mmap'd,
modified via the mmap'd region, and then an msync is done,
all on a mostly quiet system.
However, I don't see how they will work if there has been
something like a sync(2) done after the mmap'd region is
modified and the msync call.  When the inode is written out
as part of the sync process, I_DIRTY_PAGES will be cleared,
thus causing a miss in this code.
The I_DIRTY_PAGES check here is good, but I think that there
needs to be some code elsewhere too, to catch the case where
I_DIRTY_PAGES is being cleared, but the time fields still need
to be updated.

So I'm working on my next solution for this bug now.
