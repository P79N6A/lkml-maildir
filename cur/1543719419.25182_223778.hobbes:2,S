I managed to narrow it down to a diff between 2.6.6-rc1 and 2.6.6-rc2
2.6.6-rc1 works fine and 2.6.6-rc2 exhibits the lockup on the third card.
Reverting this hunk makes everything happy again.
I also tested this against 2.6.7-rc1-bk4 and it solves the problem.
I don't pretend to understand why, just did the donkey testing to locate it.

Hope this helps shed some light.. Still don't understand why it works perfectly with only 2 cards 
however.
