Hi again,
 AFFS for 2.3.99 is now almost ready for testing.
I guessed correctly, the missing get_block function was causing the
problem of not being able to read files. This now seems to work well,
I've given it some abuse, reading multiple files concurrently etc..
There are only three outstanding issues.
1. Write support is untested.
   The reason for this is point 2.
2. If I mount a disk image via loopback thus:
	mount workbench3.adf /mnt/test/ -o loop,ro
   Everything works fine.
   Not specifying readonly locks up something in the VFS.
   At this point I am unable to mount/umount any other fs.
   What changes have been made to the mount process from 2.2 -> 2.3 ?
   If someone can point me at the kernel version they roughly occured,
   I'll check the changes, and implement similar changes to affs.
3. There seems to be little (if any) locking in the affs code.
   I've started adding some lock_kernel() calls, as this seems to be
   what other filesystems are doing right now as opposed to spinlocks.
   I'm still doubtful of affs on SMP, and I have no SMP box to test with,
   so if after I've made my changes, someone else can test/improve affs in
   this area, that'd be better for everyone.
Finally, can someone who uses/used this filesystem on 2.2.x confirm that
it supports all standard Amiga disk formats or not ? If not, which ones
are missing?
As always, any assistance gratefully accepted..
regards,
-- 
Dave.
