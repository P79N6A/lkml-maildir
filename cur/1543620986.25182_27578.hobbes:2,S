That would be great. We (gpm list) have been talking about it a few
years ago, but Ian Zimmerman reported a problem with mapping glyphs to
keyboard input: there was no mean (at least back then) to pass the
complete mapping from the kernel to user space.  Sure doing it for the
trivial mapping is trivial, and I think it would be an interesting
experiment.  I was even thinking to have a try some time ago, when I
was the gpm maintainer.

Please get on the gpm mailing list (gpm@lists.linux.it) and let's put
together an implementation.
