This is not a problem with w being an unsigned int, it's a problem with 
the while loop.  nfsacl_size() returns unsigned int as it should and the 
while loop can be written to respect that since integer division in C 
truncates:
	for (n = w / PAGE_SIZE; n > 0; n--)
		if (!rqstp->rq_respages[rqstp->rq_resused++];
