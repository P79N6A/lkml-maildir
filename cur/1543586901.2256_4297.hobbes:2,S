I'd be interested in the answer to that too.  Typically, the memory
layout has ELF text at the lowest address, starting at 0x08048000 -
which is a curious place to put it, until you realize that if you
place the stack below it, you can use (in a typical small program)
just one page table for stack + text + data (then another for mmaps
and shared libs from 3GB down): two page tables instead of present three.
