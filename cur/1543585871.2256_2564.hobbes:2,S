And then you must face the fact that there may be the need for
some of the shelf software, which isn't well supported on 
correspondig 64 bit architectures... as well. So the
arguemnt doesn't hold up to the reality in any way.
BTW. For many reasons 32 bit architecutres are in
respoect of some application shemes *faster* the 64.
Ultra III in 64 mode just crawls in comparision to 32.
Alpha - unfortulatly an orphaned and dyring archtecutre... which
is not well supported by sw verndors...
