The problem is one of making it user-comprehensible.
If I just use grok_partitions I get no disc nodes created in devfs.  If 
I do my thing I get a floppy node created, regardless of wether a disk 
is inserted at load time.  This gives something for you to attempt to 
mount after inserting a disk, that causes a revalidate, and gets the 
correct disk nodes created.
This is made somewhat more complicated by the fact that ide-floppy disks 
can use either the whole disk, with no partition table or, more 
commonly, partition4.  So a user-friendly solution would be to create a 
floppy node that pointed to the partition, if it existed, or the whole 
disk if it didn't.  With appropriate code to handle that fact that 
anyone can partition these disks in any way they like.
Note this doesn't take account of the nice ATAPI command that sets the 
disk into "ignore track 0" mode, making a partition 4 look like an 
entire floppy with 1 less track.
Anyone up to telling me how this is handled in the SCSI layer?

Sorry, not trying to detract from anyone's work.  That line refers to 
mandrake having the clik support way before it was included in the stock 
kernel.  I'll clarify the web page.
