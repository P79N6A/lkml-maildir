OK, that doesn't matter that much. At least the patch makes sense and
your example shows why original code is wrong, so I will merge it. If
anybody had a problem with it, the code would be easily bisectable
(there are so few patches in 2.4) and it's easy to revert it.
Thanks to you both, Eric and Dann !
