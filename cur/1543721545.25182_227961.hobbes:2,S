For that is intended upcoming block device handler with block 
layer/cache support,
which will be in its exec() method check, if requested blocks in cache, 
and, if not, dispatch the commands to block layer, leaving regular 
scsi_do_req() calls for tapes, changers, etc. In the similar way "_perf" 
handlers work (they don't send READ/WRITE commands to SCSI devices for 
performance studies).
This device handler is on our todo list. Actually, it's quite simple and 
if anyone interested, he's help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Vlad
