yep, sure - this is possible in Linux as well, mainly due to the work
underway in 2.2/2.3 to get finegrained SMP. (finegrained SMP is analogous
to 'freely preemptable kernel') This does not mean any conceptual
difference wrt. managing latencies though, and certainly not any
conceptual latency improvements as the kernel_lock has to be honored on
SMP. (the kernel lock alone can be held for several millisecs). So the
'managing preemption point latencies' issue becomes a 'managing spinlock
latencies' issue.

it increases the complexity of spinlocks for example, one crucial piece of
code. it also raises interesting questions about 'do we want to schedule
away a task holding a crucial semaphore'. So in fact an asynchronously
preemptable kernel can _increase_ latencies.

currently only the 'NMI watchdog' is using this, which has constant
overhead and no locking. It can be disabled both runtime and compile-time.
