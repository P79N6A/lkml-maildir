For the RT patched stuff that should read
#if defined(CONFIG_SMP) || defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS)
  extern int del_timer_sync(struct timer_list *timer);
  extern int del_singleshot_timer_sync(struct timer_list *timer);
#else
# define del_timer_sync(t) del_timer(t)
# define del_singleshot_timer_sync(t) del_timer(t)
#endif

I saw it. Once again, I don't see how that can happen. __rpc_execute()
should be calling rpc_delete_timer() before it calls task->tk_action.
There should be no instances of RPC entering call_transmit() or any
other tk_action callback with a pending timer.
