hi,
I noticed that the option CONFIG_PARIDE_PARPORT will always be "y",
even if CONFIG_PARIDE_PARPORT="n". I checked with kernels 2.2.18
and 2.2.19.
the file responsible is "drivers/block/Config.in", around line 126.
it reads:
# PARIDE doesn't need PARPORT, but if PARPORT is configured as a module,
# PARIDE must also be a module.  The bogus CONFIG_PARIDE_PARPORT option
# controls the choices given to the user ...
if [ "$CONFIG_PARPORT" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_PARPORT" = "n" ] ; then
   define_bool CONFIG_PARIDE_PARPORT y
else
   define_bool CONFIG_PARIDE_PARPORT m
fi
so, as you can see, CONFIG_PARIDE_PARPORT will be set to "yes" even
if CONFIG_PARPORT="no".
why not simply write:
	define_bool CONFIG_PARIDE_PARPORT $CONFIG_PARPORT
instead?
