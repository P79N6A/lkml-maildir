Nothing sleeps on PageUptodate, so I don't think that could explain it.
The fs: fix __block_write_full_page error case buffer submission patch
does change the locking, but I'd be really suprised if that was the
problem, because it changes locking to match the regular non-error path
submission.
It could be possible that ext3 is doing something weird and expecting
the old behaviour if it failed get_block, but that seems pretty weird
to do, and would need fixing.
fs: nobh data leak... again hard to see how it could cause an unlock/wakeup
to get lost. Is Mariusz using the nobh mount option?
It wouldn't hurt to test with these patches backed out...

I see what you mean. Could it be an ext3 or jbd change I wonder?
