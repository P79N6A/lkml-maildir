Both configs are at <

I have no idea why it wouldn't come up with nosmp on the command line 
(being supplied by lilo as append="nosmp").  I tried warm boot, cold boot, 
removing all power from the hardware.  I booted from a rescue cd that had 
2.6 on it and the machine came up right away.  I tried to go back to 2.4 
and it hung and then had SCSI errors again, so I installed 2.6.14.4 and 
left it running.  I can put a copy of the 2.4.32 kernel and modules up if 
that would help.
