I disagree. And it has often saved my ass on 64bit. I
On 32bit it might be reevaluated -- i didn't expect that amount
of laptop firmware bugs triggered by it, but I'm not quite
ready to give up on that yet.

This means for most lockups which are hard to reproduce we don't 
get any backtrace.
And nmi_watchdog=2 is bad because it runs at HZ frequency 
and has quite high overhead.

Production kernels don't have lock debugging enabled because it 
has far too much overhead.

None of which is enabled on non debug kernels.

Sure lock debugging will probably catch most of this earlier,
but we don't have it usually.
