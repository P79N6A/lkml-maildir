Hello
Somehow I managed to determine a linux kernel configuration where at least the
keyboard works upon startup:
USB HID is off at all
Input core kbd is off
Input core mouse is on.
USB is on.
The question is: How is it possible the keyboard works when it is
switched off on two (=all possible) places at the same time?
So, if it's a PS/2 keyboard, it's swiched off by input core.
If it's a USB keyboard it's switched off by USB HID.
