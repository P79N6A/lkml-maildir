No...
From RFC1094:
----------------
2.3.3.  fhandle
          typedef opaque fhandle[FHSIZE];
      The "fhandle" is the file handle passed between the server and the
      client.  All file operations are done using file handles to refer
      to a file or directory.  The file handle can contain whatever
      information the server needs to distinguish an individual file.
-----------------
IOW: the server is required to distinguish an individual file.
Note that there is no time limit on this: if I try to write to a file that 
was deleted behind my back, the server is supposed to be able to determine 
which file I was writing to.
This is further clarified in RFC1813:
-----------------
      If two file handles from the same server are equal, they must refer to
      the same file
------------------
Again: at no point does the RFC say that there is a timelimit on the above 
(unlike the so-called 'volatile filehandles' that were introduced for NFSv4)
Indeed if you think about it, then there is no way the RFC *can* allow the 
client to take the burden: we are talking about a stateless system. Unless 
the server has a way of notifying the client that a filehandle is invalid, 
and/or the file was deleted there is no way that the client can know...
