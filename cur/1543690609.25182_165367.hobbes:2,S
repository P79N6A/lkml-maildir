For sure -- there are examples in the current kernel documentation which used
mixed case, which I personally feel is not as nice as lower case. I wanted to
tend on the side of working with whatever documentation we have though, and deal
with making the entire world pretty at some later date.
Note also that the patch only makes the internal handling of the tags case
insensitive -- it doesn't change the case of the tags in the kernel-doc, and it
respects the case the author chose when it emits the tags to the intermediate
SGML files used by mandocs.

This patch was more a case of putting the temporary files where the user
expected them to be. To me, the risk associated with a poorly intentioned person
substituting incorrect manual pages for the internal kernel APIs is sufficiently
low that I am uncertain if it is worthwhile going with a patch to make this
safer. I'm quite content to be wrong on this point however -- do people feel
that making the mandocs scripts temporary file safe is an important goal?
Cheers,
Mikal
