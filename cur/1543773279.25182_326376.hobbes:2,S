You're being overly paranoid :)
This netdev-2.6.git episode was the first time I ever tried to use the 
conflict merging.  I didn't know git had improved to the point where 
"git commit" without any arguments would actually get things right.
All the other merges used the vanilla git-pull-script with no 
modifications.  Presumably it does the right thing :)
