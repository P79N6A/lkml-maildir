You've made sure that your original drive (the IBM) has the lowest ID
number on the bus?

Looks like you put a UW drive (the IBM) on the same u160/lvd channel as a
u160/lvd drive (the Seagate).  Should work fine but this is where I would
focus my suspicion.
Note that a UW bus needs to be really, really short.  How long is your
cabling end-to-end?
