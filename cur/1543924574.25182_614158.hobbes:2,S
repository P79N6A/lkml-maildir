  Thanks for explanation. I guess I should warn you a bit :) Quota stores
it's data (which are in a certain sence filesystem metadata) in regular
files and believe me it brings some unexpected complexity. Especially
avoiding deadlocks with journaled filesystems was quite complex for quotas
(you cannot call filesystem write function when a transaction is already
started or deadlocks can happen).
  I guess with capabilities you need to write to the file only in some
special situations but still you could have problems with that.
