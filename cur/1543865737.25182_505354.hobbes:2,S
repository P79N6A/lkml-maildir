Well, yeah.  The patches I sent had:
struct asys_completion {
         long            return_code;
         unsigned long   cookie;
};
That's as stupid as it gets.

Obviously, yes.
The potential win is to be able to have one place to wait for  
collection from multiple sources.  Some of them might want more data  
per event.  They can always indirect out via a cookie pointer,  sure,  
but at insanely high message rates (10gige small messages) one might  
not want that.
