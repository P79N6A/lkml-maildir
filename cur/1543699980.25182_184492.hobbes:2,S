Larger stripes may help in general, but I'd suggest that for raid5 (ie, not
raid0), the stripe size should not be enlarged as much.  On many
filesystems, a bitmap change, or inode table update shouldn't require
reading a large stripe from several drives to complete the pairity
calculations.
Probably finding the largest block of data the drive can return in one
command would be a good size for a raid5 stripe.  That's just speculation
though.
