Hi,
Just saw this from gcc:
drivers/char/drm/i915_drv.c: In function ?i915_suspend?:
drivers/char/drm/i915_drv.c:173: warning: array subscript is above array
bounds
  CC [M]  drivers/char/drm/i915_dma.o
drivers/char/drm/i915_drv.c: In function ?i915_resume?:
drivers/char/drm/i915_drv.c:220: warning: array subscript is above array
bounds
It's this code:
        dev_priv->saveGR[0x18] =
                i915_read_indexed(VGA_GR_INDEX, VGA_GR_DATA, 0x18);
which looks legit, since saveGR is
        u8 saveGR[24];
It has been introduced by commit
ba8bbcf6ff4650712f64c0ef61139c73898e2165, which seems to be you Jesse.
