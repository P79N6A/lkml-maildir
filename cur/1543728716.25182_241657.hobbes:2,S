i'm not abusing it. Linear searching of 20 thousand symbols is a gross
first-approximation algorithm no matter what. Yes, most users of the
symbols dont care about performance. And i'm not complaining at all, i'm
just pointing out the reason why e.g. printing a simple stack backtrace
can take milliseconds.

yeah. Maybe someone will find the time to improve the algorithm. But
it's not a highprio thing.
