See linux/include/asm-xxx/signal.h in your kernel tree, where xxx is the 
specific arch you are interested in.
You will see definitions for a series of  _NSIG macros.  These define the 
number of available signals and the byte size of the signal mask data 
type.  The stuff at the bottom is educational as well.  You can then 
follow those defines into other header files as needed.
Happy hacking,
