This doesn't really do what you would think it does - the defines should
be called DEFAULT_PHYS_SEGMENTS etc, since they are just default values
and do not denote any max-allowed-by-driver value.
But it is strange why your system wont boot after applying the above.
What happens (and what kind of storage)?
