Subject: [PATCH] properly account readahead file major faults
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The fault accounting of filemap_dopage() is currently unable to account
for readahead pages as major faults.
Which means that getrusage's major fault reporting is pretty useless.
Fix that by using the PageReferenced and PageActive bits: allows
differentiation between newly accessed pages and reaccessed pages.
Follows the output of "/usr/bin/time -v"  of an app which reads
10MB through a mapping on cold pagecache.
BEFORE PATCH:
Size: 10MB
Loops: 10
opening ./scan-testfile
reading scan-testfile, length = 10MB
	Command being timed: "./scan-shared 10 10"
<snip>
	Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 225
	Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 2437
AFTER PATCH:
Size: 10MB
Loops: 10
opening ./scan-testfile
reading scan-testfile, length = 10MB
	Command being timed: "./scan-shared 10 10"
<>snip>
	Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 2562
	Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 101
