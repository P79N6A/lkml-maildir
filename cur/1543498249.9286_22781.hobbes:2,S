Hi there,
I tried to reproduce what md@linux.it (Marco d'Itri) wrote on Sun, 6 Jun
1999 21:25:13 +0200
to this list [Subject: kmalloc: Size (3149576632) too large], on my system
running 2.3.5 kernel.
The result was an indeciphrable and long list of hex number, that I enclose
here (gzipped),
hoping that someone can understand what actually happens.
The version of ping used is from iputils-ss990530_tar.
Thanks a lot.
