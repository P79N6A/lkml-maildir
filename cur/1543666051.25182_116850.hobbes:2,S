Yup, what I mean is that the system shouldn't have to depend on a
human-usable name. It's usually very hard to generate unique names
that are also human-friendly, so I think it's better not to try in
the first place. (Just look at e-mail message-ids for an example.)

I called it hairy, because you need to retrieve something from a
machine that may not be available at that time. Waiting until it
comes back usually isn't a choice. Of course, this information
may be replicated on other machines that are available, and that
your repository/agent knows of, etc.
In any case, this would be an optimization. Bandwidth and disk
space are cheap, so it's not so bad to carry a few kB of history
around for each file.

Oh, I'd say it's an entirely different type of development. The
kernel has to deal with real-time concurrency and subtle
performance issues. An SCM can quite easily eliminate concurrency
to the point that all operations become nice, linear batch jobs
on a completely static data set. On the other hand, the SCM is
likely to work on more complex data structures, and will have a
closer interaction with what is user policy.
While performance is certainly an important issue for an SCM, I'd
expect this to be something that can be safely ignored for a good
while during development. (I'm a firm believer in the
prototype-burn-rewrite-burn_again-... type of software development.
Maybe this shows :-)
