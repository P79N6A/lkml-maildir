It's benchmark. Benchmark is great way to spot the problem but it's not very
usefull to prove that you have solution.

If it's good for you then use it ! What's the problem here ? If you want it
to be included in kernel... It's COMPLETELY other story.

I dunno. If latencies were due to some PCI bus interation then you'll get
the same 1.5ms or EVEN WORSE (PCI bus on 1GHz PIII can be slower in some
[rare] situations). That's the point: you find that patch works great to
you. You STILL have any proof that it'll do the same for millions of other
boxes out there.

You - may be. Linus - not :-) That's why Linus works (unlike some other OSes).
