aha, okay. so ramfs/inode.c defines init_rootfs, which in fact *is*
absolutely needed by the kernel in fs/namespace.c
but then Configure.help is missleading, and RAMFS should not be a CONFIG_
option anyway.
  : Simple RAM-based file system support
  : CONFIG_RAMFS
  :   Ramfs is a file system which keeps all files in RAM. It allows
  :   read and write access.
  : 
  :   It is more of an programming example than a usable file system.
