I found your patch some time ago, and modified it for 1000HZ ,
(changing all 4's to 10's  :-) ) , and it works quite well
but what are the implications (are these serious) of wrong times reported to userspace ?
do you know which syscalls will report wrong times  ?
PS: does anyone a reasonable upper limit to HZ on PII hardware ?
will increase HZ too much lead to  cache-performance drops,
du too much context switching ?
I think 2000 would not degrade much the performance on a PII class system.
(If i remember BeOS has 250usec scheduling latencies  HZ=4000 ? )
regards,
Benno.
