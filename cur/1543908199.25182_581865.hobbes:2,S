We currently also do *not* write out immediately. I/O is queued when 
submitted so it does *not* reduce memory. It is better to actually delay 
writeout until you have thrown out clean pages. At that point the free 
memory is at its high point. If memory goes below the high point again by 
these writes then we can again reclaim until things are right.

Ok mempools are unrelated. The allocations problems that this patch 
addresses can be fixed by making reclaim more intelligent. This may likely 
make mempools less of an issue in the kernel. If we can reclaim in an 
emergency even in ATOMIC contexts then things get much easier.
