I've never seen that used. I assume the procedure is something like:
1. login on client (requires home directory be local)
2. ssh to server (local window for password)
3. user mode mount to another directory (assuming not mounting working
   directory - marked busy, though that might be allowed)
4. use another window for local usage.
	mountd port has to be redirected
	nfsd port(s) have to be redirected (I think, might not apply to server)
	biod port(s) have to be redirected
	lockd port(s) have to be redirected (unless nolocking)
	statd port(s) have to be redirected (not sure)
And only a single user per host (not unreasonable).
Would it also work for windows/Macs?
