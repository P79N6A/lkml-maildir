Well certainly the usual way to layout a PCI bus the interrupt does have
to do with the device number.

Just don't use one that is already in use.  The link you sent seemed to
indicate 20 and 19 were the defaults.  That matches with 0x13 and 0x14
so I guess it is.  If 00:10 isn't in use you could try that one (device
16).  If nothing else uses them, 16, 17, 18, 19 would be worth trying
since that should (normally at least) try all the interrupt
possibilities.

0x14 = IRQ 20
0x13 = IRQ 16
0x10 = IRQ 19
0x0f = IRQ 18
0x0e = IRQ 17
0x0d = IRQ 20
Hmm, certainly the onboard devices are assigned in interesting order.
Is it possible that this board does simply not allow more pci slots?
After all if the BIOS knows that the only PCI slot in the system is
device 20 (0x14) then it has no reason to have any rule for how to
assign an interrupt to device 19 or anything else for that matter.  If
that is the case you would have to find out what interrupt is used as
INTA, B, C and D on device 20, so you can calculate which one would end
up on the other device (assuming the riser card maps them correctly,
which it probably does), and assign that to the card.  Of course it is
also possible that if you try other device numbers you could get lucky
and have the BIOS happen to assign the right value to your card for one
of them.
I see that VIA as their own 2 port riser card which is labeled as
working only with via boards, which may also mean that other riser cards
do not necesarily work with the via boards without some non standard
tweaking of the software.
