I see what you're getting at... (I was thinking of the mutex grab stage, not
the release stage).
Anyway, I though I could get away with it, but on reflection, perhaps
not... If two threads of the same process try and issue ReleaseMutex()
simultaneously on one mutex, then theoretically, one should succeed and the
other fail, but given the above code, you are right... there would be a race.
Between threads of different "processes" I don't think it'll actually be a
problem, since mutex theft isn't permitted. I also don't think there'll be a
conflict between grab and release, since the actual release is the last thing
done by the ReleaseMutex function, and the actual grab is the first thing done
by the MutexPoll function.
But you are right... It should be guarded anyway. Perhaps what I should do is
to use the owner field as the mutex (NULL is available) and use cmpxchgl to do
the grab _and_ the release.
