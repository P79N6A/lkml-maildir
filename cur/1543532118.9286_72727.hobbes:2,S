Another way of dealing with this is to have local copies of the credentials in
each task, as well as the shared credentials, each with change counter.  At
entry to each syscall which cares, the task can check to see if its creds are
up to date and copy them from the shared creds if not.  It's not wildly clean,
but it is one of those cases where copying rather than sharing can simplify
locking a lot.
I guess you could do it in the library too, if you make each syscall wrapper
check the thread credential validity before entering the kernel.
