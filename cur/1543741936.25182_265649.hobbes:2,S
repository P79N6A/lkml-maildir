Actually it's only some early steppings of 386 and Linux never ran on
a 286 or earlier. I think the best would be to just ignore it, the affected
user base is very likely zero or very near it. I suspect the 
probability of one of these machines still used as a multiuser
machine is very definitely nil.
Cue is that 386 got occassionally broken, and it often took 
months to be noticed.
These machines already have other exploitable bugs BTW that have been
ignored for a long time and only been fixed in 2.6.
So just ignore it. It's a non issue, really.
