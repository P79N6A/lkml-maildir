The "Before" figure is intentionally simple because it is enough to 
understand how the meta-data device of DualFS works, and why the cleaner 
is deadlock-free ;-)

I agree with all the above, althoug it displays the wort case because a 
partial segment usually contains several datablocks, and a few indirect 
blocks. But it is fine for our purposes.

I do not agree with this picture, because it does not show that all the 
indirect blocks which point to a direct block are along with it in the 
same segment. That figure should look like:
Segment 1: [some data] [ DA D1' D2' ] [more data]
Segment 2: [some data] [ D0 D1' D2' ] [more data]
Segment 3: [some data] [ DB D1  D2  ] [more data]
where D0, DA, and DB are datablocks, D1 and D2 indirect blocks which 
point to the datablocks, and D1' and D2' obsolete copies of those 
indirect blocks. By using this figure, is is clear that if you need to 
move D0 to clean the segment 2, you will need only one free segment at 
most, and not more. You will get:
Segment 1: [some data] [ DA D1' D2' ] [more data]
Segment 2: [                free                ]
Segment 3: [some data] [ DB D1' D2' ] [more data]
......
Segment n: [ D0 D1 D2 ] [         empty         ]
That is, D0 needs in the new segment the same space that it needs in the 
previous one.
The differences are subtle but important.

 	Juan.
