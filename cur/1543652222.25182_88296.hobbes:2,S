Hi!
> But stuff like battery info in /proc/acpi just has no excuse.
Yes... But how should "generic" battery info look like?
On apm you only know percentages and ETA left.
On acpi you know voltages, capacities and present rate.
On zaurus you only know voltages.
It will be quite hard to decide "one correct interface". It should
probably be called "/proc/power".
