It's clearly a bug. x86-64 compat user space should be 99+% compatible
and running full 32bit user land with a 64bit kernel is supposed to work.
The main exceptions are a few programs that rely on the 3GB address space
(these can be used with linux32 --3gb), some programs which
make bogus assumptions about /proc,/sys which cannot be fixed
and a few programs which use obscure driver specific ioctls with
no compat wrapper.
