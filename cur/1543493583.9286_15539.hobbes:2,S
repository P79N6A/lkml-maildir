Hello.
Is there any plugnplay support within Linux kernel. (not just for resource
allocation and such) that also
includes features like
	- bus driver model where the driver enumerates devices but the
actual job
              of loading the exact driver is handled by the driver. (when i
look at the USB driver
              iam getting a feeling that we maintain a list of drivers and
handle this within USB driver code)
              is this the preferred approach in Linux?
            - Could SCSI adapter drivers be module drivers? the scsi
subsystem seems non reentrant with the restriction
              that scsi_init() and such should be called in during boot. If
we have a new scsi controller hot plug for example
              could the appropriate driver be loaded on demand, and which
case the scsi_register() etc and the drive
              enumeration/numbering may not work fine.
is this assumption correct.  Could someone on the list provide a right
layered approach for drivers and is there any work
being done to handle hotplug pci etc
