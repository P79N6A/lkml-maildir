Hi!
I have some strange problems with a new wireless keyboard from
Fujitsu-Siemens (Keybird Wireless). It works fine under other OSes, but
in my Linux-Console some special keys (like Cursor up/down/left/right
Page up/down) are repeated. I receive two "characters" instead of one. 
Under XFree86 the problem extends: Now all characters are repeated!
Sorry for posting this directly to the linux-kernel maillinglist, but I
don't think this is a problem with my hardware, because under other OS
it works fine.
I also tried to set various keyboard repeat rates, but nothing changed.
I am using Linux 2.4.4.
Is this problem already known?
