Subject: [PATCH] [DLM] don't require FS flag on all nodes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/9/266

From: David Teigland <teigland@redhat.com>
Mask off the recently added DLM_LSFL_FS flag when setting the exflags.
This way all the nodes in the lockspace aren't required to have the FS
flag set, since we later check that exflags matches among all nodes.
