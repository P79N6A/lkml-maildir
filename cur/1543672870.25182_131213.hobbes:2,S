(from the build script)
CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
# CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI is not set
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
My motherboard has the SiS645 chipset.  
The SiS961 is the I/O APIC (ACPI 1.0b and APM 1.2 Compliant).
Currently my BIOS ACPI is set to suspend to standby (but I don't use it
and so haven't configured it in the kernel). 
I will rebuild the kernel with ACPI support and let you know the results
(later today...after sleep).
Thanks for your reply,
Bob
