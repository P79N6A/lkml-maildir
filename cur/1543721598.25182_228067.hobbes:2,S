I think if in-lines are exported through more than one level of indirection 
through include files then the code is hard to grok.

Object based code good for some things, and not for others.  I think it could 
be a good match this code, but I bet it can be done well other ways as too.
I think without exporting abstractions (even just prototypes) that are common 
across architectures, timebases and interrupt source you will get into #ifdef 
hell with this code.
