All;
What is the status of the problems with the old KT133 and kernel 2.4.8 ?
I have a system here which looks to me as if its beginning to suffer from
HDD failure, just do anything with the disk for a while and you get disk {
busy } errors (and there is an 0x0d error code there somewhere) ... (oh, and
the HDD light reports no activity) normally, i would view this as a good
time to pull all the data off the drive and replace it.
However, i have noticed that the chipset used is the Via KT133, and am now
wondering if this is actually a HDD problem (i still am siding with this) or
a chipset problem.
You can guarantee the problem by just running badblocks -sv /dev/hda
and it will happen at some point, (not always the same place)
Can anyone offer any advice on this ?
Thanks,
Dave
