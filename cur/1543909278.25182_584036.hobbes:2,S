Well, the mux could check this next time select/poll indicates there is
something to read from the pty and use the GSM0710 modem bits setting
packet type to communicate that to the hardware that has the async
ports.
This is just handwaving tho, haven't checked if TCSETS works well on a
pty and if afterwards a TCGETS will retrieve the changed values. Check
if that is the case and try to find a way to avoid doing a TCGETS for
every read from the pty, perhaps with a flag that starts at zero and at
first read you set it to one, then after you detect that the pty was
closed you set it back to zero.

Look at GSM 07/10. I implemented a userland multiplexer for a customer,
that decided to keep it closed, but I think that Harald Welte has
written an open source implementation in the open moko project, haven't
checked this tho.
No need to implement it all on the hardware with the async ports side,
just the type 0 (if my memory serves me 8) will be enough for what you
want.

Well, just use a select look on the pty and the real serial device and
mux/demux using GSM0710, apps will be throttled by the pty code, etc.
