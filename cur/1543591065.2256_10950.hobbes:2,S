This would leave no way (without introducing new interfaces) to write,
for example, the boot block on an ext2 filesystem.  Note that the
bootblock (defined as the first 1024 bytes) is not actually used by
the filesystem, although depending on the block size it may share a
block with the superblock (if blocksize > 1024).
