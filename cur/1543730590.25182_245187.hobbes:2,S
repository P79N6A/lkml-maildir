Hi James, thanks for your comment.

The results are as follows:
o dbench [ 1/2/4 processes run parallely on 4-CPUs / 10 times trials ]
- Average[MB/s] -  -1proc- -2procs- -4procs-
2.6.8.1(disable)    247.43   473.11   891.51
2.6.8.1(enable)     218.99   434.97   761.06
2.6.8.1(+rwlock)    225.18   432.80   802.62
2.6.8.1(+RCU)       231.84   444.30   820.00
--------------------------------------------
(*) 2.6.8.1(+RCU) is applied the take3-patch.
By the way, the results of dbench are sharply changed at every measurement.
I don't think it is statistically-significant.
