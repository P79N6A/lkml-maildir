As I can "see" not so good.
I've tried "dbench 32" and playing an MP3 with Noatun (KDE-2.2.2) and  "saw" 
my reported hiccup since 2.4.7-ac4, as always.
Noatun stops after 9-10 seconds of the "dbench 32" run and then every few 
seconds, again and again. The hiccup take place more often but for shorter 
times then without your patch.
System was:
2.4.16 +
preempt +
lock-break-rml-2.4.16-1.patch +
all ReiserFS patches for 2.4.16
1 GHz Athlon II
MSI MS-6167 Rev 1.0B (AMD Irongate C4, without bypass)
640 MB PC100-2-2-2 SDRAM
U160 IBM 18 GB disk
AHA-2940 UW

Throughput was a little lower ;-)
Don't forget to tune max-readahead.
I've used 127 and that gave me 4 MB (at the end) to 6 MB (at the beginning of 
the disk) more transferrate.
Write caching is off per default on all of my disks and it didn't offer much 
gain with dbench and bonnie++.

Yes, please. I think, too that we need IO priority even for "little" IO 
consuming (weak) RT tasks (MP3, DVD, etc).

I'll second that.
Thank you for your work, Andrew!
