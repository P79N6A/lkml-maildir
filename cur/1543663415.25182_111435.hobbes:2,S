Several of my bugs are sitting in the resolve state because of Bugzilla 
user interface issues.  The interface does not allow me to take a bug 
directly from "assigned" to "closed" state.  Closed is not even 
presented as an option.  If the bug is indeed in the resolved state, 
then I can close the bug.  But this two-step process is a bit silly.
Also, several of my 'resolved' bugs have comments that clearly indicate 
the fix has been merged.  So, now I must go in a clicking spree, taking 
valuable time away from hacking :)  Don't we have kind and gracious 
Bugzilla janitors for this sort of thing?
