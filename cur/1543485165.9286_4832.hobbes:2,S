as a pointed out some time ago, I got the same problem with compiled in
APM-support. But I don't know in what kernel it appears the first time,
because I always used kernels out of the (Debian)box. Perhabs there is a
connection between your and my problem. I don't know it because I can't
read the kernel-source code.
Bye, Andreas.
