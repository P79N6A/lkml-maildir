nothing really different. we have 5-6 servers like this one and
this one have been crashed for 2 days only (once per day).
never before !? when the server crashed the load was 1.2. nothing
really bad.
the only difference is: this server has the serial cart. I was
in contact with Ted for the serial problem on Linux, but I have
no news from about the crashs.
I do not know if the serial cart can crash the server that
interrupts are disabled ?
