No, but in some scripts [devanagari anyway] you only ever write a vowel as
a letter if it's at the front of the word: otherwise vowels are added as 
sort of 'accents' to the consonants, plus there are letters that sometimes
smoosh together if they are next to one another, iirc, and long and short
forms for each vowel, and each accent-form, plus there are other
idiosyncrasies...
There seems to be kanji console thing called kon, looking at the package,
it looks like it's implemented in userspace - perhaps a similar approach
would be fruitful?
