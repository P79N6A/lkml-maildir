Well, I was once very 'luckily' and after a system crash (*) e2fsck put all 
files into lost+found. Sure, I never experienced this again, but I also never 
experienced something like this with reiserfs. So please, stop this kind of 
FUD against reiser3.6.
While filesystem speed is nice, it also would be great if reiser4.x would be 
very robust against any kind of hardware failures.
(*) The problem was a specific mainboard + video-card + driver combination. As 
soon as X started up, the system entirely crashed. I don't believe many bytes 
were written, but I also can't prove it.
