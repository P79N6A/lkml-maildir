Hi All,
I am writing a libata-complaint SATA driver for an ARM board.
I want to do data streaming from a tuner into the SATA hard disk.
In other words, I am getting a buffer of stream in kernel space, which
I had to store it in SATA hard disk.
Can I use filesystem (eg., XFS) to put the buffer into the SATA hard
disk without getting into user space.
What I mean, can I write an Linux Kernel Module to route data stream
from one device into SATA hard disk.
Thanks,
deven
