Btw nothing about HOTPLUG_CPU now but something is broken.
do a defconfig , make menuconfig , disable ACPI , make , and you get :

$ grep ACPI .config
# Power management options (ACPI, APM)
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=y
CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ=y
CONFIG_X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI=y
CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ_PROC_INTF=y
Looks like CONFIG_X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI selects only ACPI_PROCESSOR , guessing it should depend on ACPI ?
