I assume the netfilter hook you come in on is NF_IP_LOCAL_IN?  This is
at ip level.  The sock (sk) is protocol specific, and hasn't been
looked up yet.  Look at the protocols' input handlers (i.e. udp_rcv or
tcp_v4_rcv), they do this lookup (i.e. udp_v4_lookup or __tcp_v4_lookup).
The sk_filter() point is probably the first time you have an association
between the skb (inbound) and the sock it's going to be queued to.
LSM modules use security_sock_rcv_skb at this point.
thanks,
