Could you people _PLEASE_ take this thread somewhere else?
There are people here who are trying to stabilise 2.4 and
get a stable kernel out somewhere in the near future...
(as for a suggestion where you could take it, may I
suggest linux-future@nl.linux.org ...)
thanks for keeping the list clean,

Rik
