Hi Satyam,

> 
> ioctl(SIOCSIFHWADDR) {or ioctl(SIOCSIFNAME)} could be used to change the
> hardware/MAC address {or name} of the local interface that our netpoll is
> attached to. Whenever this happens, netdev notifier chain is called out
> with the NETDEV_CHANGEADDR {or NETDEV_CHANGENAME} event message. We respond
> to that and update the local_mac {or dev_name} field of the struct netpoll.
> This makes sense anyway, but is especially required for dynamic netconsole
> because the netpoll structure's internal members become user visible files
> when either sysfs or configfs are used. So this helps us to keep up with the
> MAC address / name changes and keep the values in struct netpoll uptodate.
