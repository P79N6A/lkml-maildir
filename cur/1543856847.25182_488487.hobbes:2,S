The connection setup messages sent to the hardware need to have these
parameters so the TCP engine on the HW knows how to do connection
options, windows, etc.

I don't quite get your point about the driver aspect of this?
The HW manages the iWARP connection including data flow.  It adheres to
the MPA, RDDP, and RDMAP protocol specification IDs from the IETF.  The
HW manages how data gets pushed out in the RDMA stream.   The RDMA
Driver just requests a TCP connection and does the MPA exchange.  Then
tells the hardware to move the connection into RDMA mode.  From that
point on, the driver simply suffles IO work requests from the consumer
application to the hardware and handles asynchronous events while the
connection is up and running.
