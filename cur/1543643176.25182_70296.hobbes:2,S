Subject: lookup on unlinked directory.

Hello,
why ->create(), ->unlink(), and ->readdir() are disabled on the unlinked
but open directory (one with ->i_flags |= S_DEAD), but ->lookup() is
not?  This is especially strange, because ->rmdir() usually removes dot
and dotdot, but link_path_walk() will pretend they still exist.
Is this so for being able to do "cd .." from inside unlinked directory?
Nikita.
