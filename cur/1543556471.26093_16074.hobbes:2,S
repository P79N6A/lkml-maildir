Someone on debian-devel thought of this, but went one further: change
the gzip header magic so that only a "GPL-enabled" gzip can decompress
it.
I wonder how the zlib maintainers (zlib is not GPL) would feel about
having to add support for *that*. (:

It's not crazy, it's RMS. (: I guess he is worried about some .deb file
falling into the wrong hands and being used on a system where nobody
has heard of the GPL and there is no copy available ... then the target
user won't know his or her rights and responsibilities.
Yeah, I think it's pretty far-fetched too.
