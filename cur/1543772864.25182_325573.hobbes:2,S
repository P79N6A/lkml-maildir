Look at the read numbers - lockfree is statistically better. The
write numbers varied just too much to mean anything. Besides, this
is on ppc64, with LL/SC type of lock. Here are the x86 numbers -
tiobench on a 4(8)-way (HT) P4 system on ramdisk :
                                        (lockfree)
Test            2.6.10-vanilla  Stdev   2.6.10-fd       Stdev
-------------------------------------------------------------
Seqread         1400.8          11.52   1465.4          34.27
Randread        1594            8.86    2397.2          29.21
Seqwrite        242.72          3.47    238.46          6.53
Randwrite       445.74          9.15    446.4           9.75
The performance improvement is very significant.
We are getting killed by the cacheline bouncing of the files_struct
lock here. Writes on ramdisk (ext2) seems to vary just too
much to get any meaningful number.
Also, With Tridge's thread_perf test on a 4(8)-way (HT) P4 xeon system :
                                                                                
2.6.12-rc5-vanilla :
