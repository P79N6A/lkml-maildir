Root on raid-1 works fine for me, with and without devfs.  My kernel has
no module support, everything is compiled in.  I don't use initrd.
I have used root-raid with every 2.5 kernel except for a few that had
raid bugs. (Affecting all raid, the root weren't special.)
Until recently the root raid always did an unclean shutdown, but this didn't
cause other trouble than a bootup resync.

Are you using devfs?  I expect the name of the raid device
to be something like /dev/md/2 instead of /dev/md2 in that case.
