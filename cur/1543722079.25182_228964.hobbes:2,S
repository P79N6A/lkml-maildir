Ok, either we have two bugs with _exactly_ the same behaviour, or 
something is just getting screwed up. That single change has definitely 
been fingered as being the problem by a few people. And removing the one 
line (if you have an x86-64 system you have to remove it in the x86-64 
version of the file too) should undo the patch that seems to have caused 
the problem in the first place.
Anyway, my one-liner patch won't have applied at all if you had applied 
Andrew's patch, so the first thing to do is to double-check that it 
actually got applied. I'm still hoping. But assuming it did, can you 
enable APIC debugging in include/asm-i386/apic.h, and send the resulting 
honking huge dmesg to me and the other suspects in this on-going saga? 
Preferably both from a plain 2.6.7 kernel (well, "plain" except for the 
DEBUG enable) and from the broken kernel..
