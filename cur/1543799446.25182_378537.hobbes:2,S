but then we'd have to set it to -1 again, at [*], because we are now 
about to become a waiter. So i'm not sure it's worth switching this 
around.
Also, there are two uses of this codepath: first it's the 'did we race 
with an unlocker', in which case the lock is almost likely still 
contended. The second pass comes after we have woken up, in which case 
it's likely uncontended.
while we could split up the two cases and optimize each for its own 
situation, i think it makes more sense to have then unified, and thus to 
have more compact code. It's the slowpath after all.
