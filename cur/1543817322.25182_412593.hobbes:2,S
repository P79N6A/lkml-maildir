I don't know whether we are talking about the same thing: I propose for ia64:
clear_bit to have release semantic, smp_mb__before_clear_bit will be a noop, smp_mb_after_clear_bit will be a smp_mb().
Caller are still required to use smp_mb__before_clear_bit if it requires, on
ia64, that function will simply be a noop.
