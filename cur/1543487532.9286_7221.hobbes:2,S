Subject: PROBLEM: "bug: kernel timer added twice at c018879d" in 2.2.2

I detected a bug in Linux kernel 2.2.2.
Description: message "bug: kernel timer added twice at c018879d"
is displayed on mounting scsi cdrom. Mount command
hangs and cannot be killed.
Investigation: investigation shows, that this message is printed
by function add_timer in file kernel/sched.c.
2.2.2 added a consistency check to this function.
System.map shows that the address c018879d belongs
to function scsi_sleep. This function is in 
drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c file.
The timer, declared in this function,
is not properly initialized. Field timer.prev is not
initialized. It is used in a call
to add_timer, which misunderstands it as added twice.
