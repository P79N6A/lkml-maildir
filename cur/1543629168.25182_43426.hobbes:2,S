But not conscious enough to bother to Cc the maintainer or explain the 
clashes you saw?
Do what you like; I'm ignoring 2.5 until Marcelo gets 2.4.19 out and I can
send him the rest of the code I'm sitting on for 2.4.20-pre1; at which point
I'll update everything in my tree to build against 2.5 and require magic in
compatmac.h for the 2.4 build, and I'll look at what's changed then.
