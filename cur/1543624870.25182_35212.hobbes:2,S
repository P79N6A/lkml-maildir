Tried clearcase?

Well, it sort of works.  If you use emacs, you're set because emacs can
convert the file from read only to read/write in VC mode, which is something
we'll have to update when we go to the new format.
If you use vim and ctags, it sucks because I haven't yet taught vim how 
to go from a read only revision controlled file to a read/write file.  
It would be way cool if some vim genius out there showed me how to do
that, I know it is possible, vim has the hooks, I simply don't have the
time to go figure it out.

Sure, that part works fine.  But the write part is a lot more dicey.  And 
there has to be some way to get to the revision history for all the tools
that want that.
It's absolutely possible to do all this stuff through the file system
and a collection of smart tools, that's more or less what clearcase is.
But it sucks rocks.  One of our biggest selling points is that we *don't*
work like clearcase.  ClearCase has shown that it is a performance,
stability, and maintainence nightmare to integrate your SCM with the
filesystem.  It means your SCM system is now OS specific.  *You* may not 
care that we run on AIX/Windows/Whatever, but we have to do that to 
survive and make enough money to keep making BK better and it actually
shakes out lots of bugs.
Ask the ClearCase guys if they would choose the BK way or the ClearCase
way, given a second chance, and I'll bet you the smarts would do BK.

Yeah, point taken.  I need a --grep-options=<your favorites here> or something.
I need the same thing for bk diffs.
