Hi,
I booted up 2.6.24-rc1 this morning [Real early over a brew ;-)] and was
having a problems with multiple ~5 second hangs on SATA/drive init
(Something to do with "EH" something-or-other and resets but I'll email
in separately about it later unless its fixed by the time I get the chance).
Anyway, I went to fire up netconsole to get a decent log dump and hit
across the following nasty. Netconsole works fine in 2.6.23.1 with a
similar config and the same kernel parameters.
A shot of the screen is the only method I could come up with to capture
the log, I hope that is OK, it is pretty readable.
The nasty:

The config:

The 'old' 2.6.23.1 config:

Netconsole log from successfully booting 2.6.23.1:

The hardware, etc:
eth0          : Netgear FA311 10/100Mbps ethernet adapter (netsemi driver)
                connected directly to another PC using a crossover cable.
cpu           : athlon64 3500+
compiler      : gcc 4.2.2
kernel params : root=/dev/sda3 vga=0x31B nmi_watchdog=0
                netconsole=@192.168.2.1/eth0,6666@192.168.2.2/00:11:d8:c0:5e:96
I hope this report is helpful and it's not too early in the release cycle,
I'm still pretty new and not subscribed, so please CC :-)
Btw, is it preferable for non-subscribers to use the kernel bugzilla? Or
post to the list?
