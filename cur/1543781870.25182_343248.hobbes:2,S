Yes, sure.  I have applied your patch to our 2.6.11.4 tree (with the one 
liner change I emailed you just now) and have kicked off a compile.  I am 
afraid the actual testing will have to wait for tomorrow as I was actually 
on the way to bed and the make modules is taking forever or at least 
longer than I can keep my eyes open...
Best regards,
