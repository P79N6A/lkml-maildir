Is that true? We can see where the oops occurs. If it's in the module,  
nothing more needs to be said. If it's in the kernel itself, we can check  
our source. We could check all the calls the module makes to open source  
code and validate that the parameters are correct. We should be able to  
say with authority 'the module is doing the wrong thing'. We might not be  
able to say exactly what, but we could determine that it is the module.
