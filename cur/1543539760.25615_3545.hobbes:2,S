Hi all,
  I have a similar, though maybe not identical problem.
My limit is 2GB:
Jul 18 20:22:37 Io kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Jul 18 20:22:37 Io kernel: 16:00: rw=0, want=3775686, limit=2303698
The problem is persistent in at least 2.4.0-test2 test4 test5-pre1
test5-pre4. 2.2.16 reads a DVD-9 without problem. I did not try 2.3.x.
Unfortunately Brion's patch does not work for me. The drive is a Pioneer
105S.
Cheers,
Rolf
