Why do you want to pass it up to the file system, when the fs probably
doesn't know what to do about it ? I can see why you want to pass it back
as far up as you can until someone claims it.
Or are you assuming in most cases file systems would have an "io_failure"
function that reissues the request a few times then marks the fs read only
and screams ?
Incidentally the EVMS IBM volume manager code does support bad block
remapping in some situations.
