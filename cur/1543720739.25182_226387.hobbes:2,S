A transaction is written to disk as two synchronous operations: write all
the data, wait on it, write the single commit block, wait on that.
If the commit block were to hit disk before the data then we have a window
in which poweroff+recovery would replay garbage into the filesystem.
So I think we have a bug in the current ext3 barrier implementation - we
need a blk_issue_flush() before submitting the buffer_ordered commit block.

Oh, you're referring to actual I/O errors?  I tend to think all bets are
off if that happens - make sure we report it to the application, avoid
crashing the kernel and hope that fsck can get the data back...
