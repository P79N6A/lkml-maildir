Heh. If you are using http://, you should _not_ ask for "git.kernel.org".
So use
	git clone 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
 linux-2.6
instead. That should work (modulo mirroring issues - but mirroring has 
worked pretty well lately)

http:// will suck, but should work. It will be a bit frustrating, because 
when it downloads the big packs, it will just say something like
	Getting pack 4f22c0234340c4f3470c04f912969fc59ae8babc
	 which contains ...
and then it will be quiet for a _loong_ time while it downloads that 164MB 
pack..
And the real problem with http:// will come later, if you use git to keep 
up-to-date with the kernel, and I end up repacking the archive (which I 
usually do around major releases). Then it will end up fetching the newly 
repacked data - even though most of it you already have.
Anyway, there's a reason why the "native" protocols are much preferred, 
but the http:// one does work. It just requires www.kernel.org, not 
git.kernel.org.
