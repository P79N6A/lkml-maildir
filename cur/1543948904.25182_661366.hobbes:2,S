If this is the method we are going to use then we need a corresponding
set_security_blob as well. This seems like a paradigm shift for
accessing security information in the kernel. I said to Casey in the
beginning that I'd be willing to revisit it but that neither he or I
alone could make the decision. Unless I misunderstood the original
mandate for security information and that it only applies to how user
space accesses it.
