The applications are Blast and hmmer from 
http://blast.wustl.edu
 and
http://hmmer.wustl.edu
.  Blast 2.0 is the first application I was talking
about, but unfortulately isn't provided as open-source so there's probably
not much that can be done.  Hmmer is though.  Solaris is currently runnning
Hmmer on the same hardware about 100% faster than Linux - and I'm not sure
why.  Hammer does compile with pthreads enabled.  I can provide you with
the model files I am using if you are interested in doing the comparison
yourself.

I'd be very interested to see how it compared with that fixed and both
threaded / both forking.
