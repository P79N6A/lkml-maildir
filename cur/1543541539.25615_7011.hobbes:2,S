UWIN is Unix running on NT.  On an NTFS partition, you can
use cmd.exe to create named streams.  Then you can use uwin
to create hard links, which work in the "expected way":
DOS prompt window:
c:> echo there > xxx:yyy
c:> echo hello > xxx
UWIN (ksh) window:
/c> cat xxx
hello
/c> cat xxx:yyy
there
/c> ln xxx zzz
/c> cat xxx:yyy
there
/c> ls -lF
-rwxrwxrwx  2        8 Aug 12 21:50 xxx*
-rwxrwxrwx  2        8 Aug 12 21:50 zzz*
/c>
