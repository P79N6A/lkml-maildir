I have an Medion computer either and nearly the same components. Did you
enabled SiS900 support in kernel? Can you attach the dmesg output?
The only curios thing with the onboard sis900 chip is, that it does not work
in 100Mb full-duplex mode with the stable kernel tree, but there is a patch
included in -mm patchset, which makes sis900 working in 100Mb full-duplex
mode too.
