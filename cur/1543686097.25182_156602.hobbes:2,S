Here's the agpgart config I used:
all is in the kernel, nothing in a module....
dules in the kernel, not in modules,
as I used to do in 2.4 kernel, which works well for me
The configuration I tested was (from my .config file):
CONFIG_AGP=y
# CONFIG_AGP_ALI is not set
# CONFIG_AGP_AMD is not set
# CONFIG_AGP_AMD_8151 is not set
# CONFIG_AGP_INTEL is not set
# CONFIG_AGP_NVIDIA is not set
# CONFIG_AGP_SIS is not set
# CONFIG_AGP_SWORKS is not set
CONFIG_AGP_VIA=y
CONFIG_DRM=y
# CONFIG_DRM_TDFX is not set
# CONFIG_DRM_GAMMA is not set
# CONFIG_DRM_R128 is not set
# CONFIG_DRM_RADEON is not set
CONFIG_DRM_MGA=y

I guess not, as I don't use modules (and don't want to) for this feature
andI don't use any initrd (and never want too)...
