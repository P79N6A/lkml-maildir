Search the archives for the subject "APIC Error on CPU 0"
I posted it to the list some months ago.
I get these messages every three minutes on 2.6.7.
On 2.6.7-mm6 I get the messages lets say every hour
once. So it's better, but not completely away.
I can't say if the reason is not a faulty CPU. Maybe,
maybe not. Who knows.
But the point is, that its actually is _better_ in -mm.
