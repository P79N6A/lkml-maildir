I'm  just doing a reply to this message so you all can continue the 
discussion without the posting problems to the closed linuxbios list.
Yh Lu, please cc: me and ollie if you can but not the linuxbios list on 
these discussions. It is going to annoy people when they get the bounce 
message.
I should add that I never quite understood Andi's objections to the 
patch being discussed.
thanks
ron
