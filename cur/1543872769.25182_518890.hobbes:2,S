Maybe. But surely before the PCI-X days.

Is this the only place where Linux uses pci_read_config_word/pci_read_config_dword?
I think such hardware will be pretty much DOA on all OS-es.  Why don't we wait
and see whether someone reports a broken config?

True, and same holds for PCI-Express.
So let's assume hardware implements RO correctly but ignores the BE bits -
nothing bad happens then, right?
