Yes, this is the second surprise interaction between the CPU scheduler
and the IO system.
Perhaps.  In your case it seems that you're simply unable to generate
the amount of concurrency which you used to.  Which would make it purely
a CPU scheduler thing.
It is not necessarily a bad thing (unless your total runtime has increased?)
but we need to understand what has happened.
What filesystem are you using?
