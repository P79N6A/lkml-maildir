We do the list_del/list_add right now in reclaim while moving pages 
between active and inactive lists. However, reclaim is not run until the 
systems is under memory pressure. Reclaim is run rarely and then lots of 
these movements are occurring. At that point is it likely that the 
cachelines are already available since the page structs had to be touched 
for earlier movements.
