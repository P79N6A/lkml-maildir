Mostly I would like to make it "clean" enough to get the community to accept it. 
  As I look at the current implemtation, the biggest intrusion into the "normal" 
kernel is in the timer list area.  Thus, my thinking is to introduce a second or 
slave list which would only be used by HR timers.  This list would be "checked" 
by putting a "normal" i.e. add_timer, timer in place to mark the jiffie that a 
HR timer was to expire in.  The "check" code would then set up the HR interrupt 
to expire the timer.
I am also considering removing a lot of the ifdefs one way or another.  AND, I 
think I can make the whole thing configureable at boot time just as the 
pm/TSC/etc. timers are.

Uh, is this something like the current TSC/ pmtimer/ HPET/ PIT selection code in 
the x86?  Or do you have something else in mind here.  Given the goal of 
integration with and inclusion in the kernel.org kernel, I don't want to wander 
too far from what they are doing now.

I am not sure what wants to be done here.  I have to keep in mind that x86 is 
only one of many archs.  I would like to keep it as simple as possible in this 
area.  See the include/linux/hrtime.h file for the arch interface we are now using.
