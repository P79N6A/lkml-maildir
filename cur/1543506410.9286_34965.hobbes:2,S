Hello,
i have a problem with an interrupt handler. When the interrupt occurs,
I got the following message:
"Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
In interrupt handler - not syncing"
I am using the redhat 6.0 distributen with kernel 2.2.5/2.2.11. The
interrupt
handler does nothing else, than sending a sigusr2 to an application.
Why is the idle task interested in sigusr2?
TIA
