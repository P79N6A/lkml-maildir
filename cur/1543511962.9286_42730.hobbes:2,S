I don't think that's the same. I am in dvorak, and haven't checked with
defkeymap.map, but I'm talking about 
Composekey    4   e  
produces the byte value 0x4e. Keys 0 - f are *nybbles*. This gives total
generality; all possible bytes. I had to write a program to provide this,
loadkeys Compose syntax prevents it. Or at least that's how things seem to
the extent that I wrote a program to get around it.
This raises another question; I don't suggest anyone document all the
possible actions, but a synopsis of the major classes of actions, 0x000,
0x100, 0x200 etc. that corresponds to the first table in dumpkeys -l is
well worth doing methinxth.
