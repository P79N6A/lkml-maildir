Ok, in talking with the usb-storage author, I'll be accepting all
unushal_devs.h patches now, as long as they contain the following:
	- a comment above the entry with a email address of someone who
	  has this device that this entry fixes the driver for them.
	  This is to allow us to possibly remove entries at a later time
	  if the core changes, and get a verification that it's ok to do
	  so.
	- a copy of the /proc/bus/usb/devices device entry with the
	  device plugged in and the driver loaded (this should not be in
	  the patch, but in the body of the email.)
So, if there are any outstanding drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h
entries that people have floating around, sent them on!
thanks,
greg k-h
