Agrh, because of a bug in ide-scsi conversion this (other) bug went
unnoticed for a while. Basically we cannot look up the request queue
reliably from a request, since it may not have originated from the block
layer. ide-scsi builds it's own, for example. For those, we don't want
to trust the sg count either.
Does attached patch work?
