A very very very quick look at the code shows that:
 - It looks nice / clear
 - It's horribly broken in at least two area :
 DO NOT USE BITFIELDS FOR DATA ON THE WIRE !!!
 and
 Where do you handle endianness ? (no need to shout for
 that one).
(Or in general, do not use bitfields period ....)
bitfields format is not guaranteed, and is not endian consistent.
