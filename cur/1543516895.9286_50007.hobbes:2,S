So there is some hope, that it may work. I think I will put a boring
serial card into the ISA-slot of the docking station and just test it.
sync, sync, plugin... ;-)

Would be nice, indeed. 
But I am quiet used to do it manually, because the scsi driver also
doesn't support hot swapping of scsi devices. So I have to unload the
module, connect or disconnect the dat or disk or whatever and reload
the module again. Of course you have to unmount every scsi disk before
:-(. This is the best argument to buy an IDE as boot disk, despite of
price, imho.
