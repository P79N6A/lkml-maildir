note that it says *system* bus speed.  that is, the clock fed to the IDE 
controller (usually the PCI clock, 33 MHz).  this is NOT the transfer mode!
by lying to the driver that "idebus=66", all you accomplish is making your 
transfers half the speed they should be.  the driver says 
	"since the clock period is 15ns, and I want (say) udma33
	(16b every 60ns), I'll tell the controler to do 16b every 4 clocks."
alas, the real period is 30ns, so you get 16b every 120ns.  voila, udma16 ;(
summary: don't lie to the driver; the default is probably correct.
