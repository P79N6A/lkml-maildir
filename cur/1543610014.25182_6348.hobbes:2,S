             ^^^^^^^^^^ Pooaaahhh!:) What's this utter oddity ?
Only dma 32 ? :-)
Just to make things clear about how DMA width can be configured on the
driver at the moment and will ever be:
1) The 3 DMA addressing modes (32 bit, 40 bit and 64 bit limited to 16*4Gb
   are compiled options. The handshaking with other kernel parts is based
   on the pci_set_dma_mask() interface.
2) This DMA adressing mode will probably be auto-configurable on some
   further driver version, but I donnot want any useless code to be
   neither compiled nor executed by the driver for the 99,9.. % of
   real machines  that only need legacy 32 bit DMA addressing (i.e.
   Mode 0 in the driver context).
   Other DMA modes will only apply to the few configurations that
   can be probed as needing larger DMA addressing, even if larger DMA
   addressing will not harm on machines that donnot need the feature.
   As a result the DMA addressing mode will stay a compilation option,
   optionnally auto-probed at 'make kernel|module' time.
Now that things are hopefully clearer:), I donnot see any relevance about
having any additionnal flag related to DMA addressing, at least as far as
the sym-2 driver is concerned.

Thanks a lot for your work (despite the odd 'may_dma_somewhat' flag I seem
not to like that much.:) )
