I would not change anything, just suggest that users who sit
behind such a broken device do
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling
and yell loudly at their ISPs to get this fixed. Crippling the stack
by default just to work around such obvious bugs would be wrong.
In the past there were similar bugs with broken VJ header compression
algorithms that also corrupted window scaling. We just ignored
these and suggested to the users to turn it off. That worked fine.
[btw it's quite possible that this isn't a firewall, but also
some kind of header compression that is doing the wrong thing]
