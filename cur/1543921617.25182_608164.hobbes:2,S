AFAIK, there were good reasons (effect similar to fork bomb on a system 
with large number of, e.g., SCSI disks - Greg KH obviously knows more 
details) to drop /sbin/hotplug from all distributions in favour of udev. 
Anyway, the "hotplug" package is no longer supported by its author. So 
there is no option to use a non-<censored> from your viewpoint but still 
supported-upstream userspace.
As already mentioned in a different subthread, the solution is to wait 
for the firmware in the background, so that the built-in case also 
starts working. Drivers that don't do this (e.g. qla2xxx) must be fixed, 
but for now, IMHO, it does make sense to mark them as non-working in the 
non-modular case.
