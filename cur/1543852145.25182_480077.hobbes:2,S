I have a ATI Rage Pro 3D video card
and would like to use the aty frame buffer driver in hi res mode
BUT the best I can get from this driver is 640x480 256 colors
regard less what I set with append in my /etc/lilo.conf (and yes I did 
rerun lilo)
all I have been able to do with fbset is to blank the screen
so where can I find info on using this driver
or
how do I set the video mode for this driver in my lilo.conf
or could this be a bug
