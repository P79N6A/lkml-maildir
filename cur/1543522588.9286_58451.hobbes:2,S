I suppose I should throw this in -
As of 2.2.14 with andre's IDE patch, I have started getting these errors (
I did not get them with 2.2.12 or 2.2.13 and andre's ide patches before)
from dmesg:
ALI15X3: MultiWord DMA enabled
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
hda: irq timeout: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
ALI15X3: MultiWord DMA enabled
Also, 2.2.12 and 2.2.13 game me ~7MB/sec - ~6MB/sec with dma on, now with
dma on I get ~4.5MB/sec with dma on OR off (with dma on, I get less cpu
usage)..
As far as I know, nothing else has really changed (except partition size..
I made it bigger with partition magic a month or so ago)
Weirdness.
Rene
