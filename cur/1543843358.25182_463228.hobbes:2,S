Subject: [PATCH 2.4.33.3] block: fix negative bias of ios_in_flight (CONFIG_BLK_STATS) because of unbalanced I/O accounting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/14/141

Fix for unbalanced I/O accounting, that caused ios_in_flight 
(CONFIG_BLK_STATS) to become and stay negative, as suggested by Jens 
Axboe.
An added boolean field "io_account" in struct request is assumed to be 
initialized to false on new requests. On starting I/O accounting, true is 
assigned to the field. On ending I/O accounting, accounting is only 
executed if the field has already been assigned true previously. Thus, 
this fixes unbalanced cases where requests such as non-data get enqueued 
without starting to account (ide_do_drive_cmd?) but the end of accounting 
gets executed on finishing the same requests (ide_end_drive_cmd, 
end_that_request_last, req_finished_io).
The precondition of io_account being initialized to false is ensured by
1) ide_init_drive_taskfile / ide_init_drive_cmd memset'ing the whole 
request to zero, for requests that were potentially accounted unbalanced, 
and
2) get_request assigning zero to io_account on allocating a request from 
the free list cache (or slab cache initially), for the majority of 
requests such as those involving data.
Jens preferred this to other discussed solutions and it should fix all 
those unbalanced cases at once without touching each of them individually.
For more details, please see previous posts of this thread 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0608.2/0776.html.
I tested the patch with 2.4.24 and 2.4.33.3 successfully on an UP ia32 
machine with one /dev/hda.
