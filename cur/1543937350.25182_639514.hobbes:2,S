As you have noticed while working on this patch, if two different
instances of the same structure containig some lock are created in
the same place, lockdep will treat this one (the same) lock. It looks
strange, but actually it's a feature which enables to track
dependencies between different locks on 'class' level instead of
instance 'level'. The downside is that lockdep is very often too
sensitive by default, so you have to 'annotate' when instancess are
actually on different level (e.g. parents and children here) and
could be locked at the same time or in some order.
You can use e.g. mutex_lock_nested() or lockdep_set_class*() for this.
Then lockdep simply trusts you, and starts to think they are different
locks. If you do it wrong there will be simply no more warnings, but
undercover lockups still possible (and diagnosing a bit harder then).
So, since in your patch there are two levels of locking, and you
started to annotate lockdep about a child taking parent's class lock
with: 
mutex_lock_nested(&parent_class->mutex, SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING);
you should do the same everywhere in a situation like this.
lockdep will treat this simply as lock B vs. A (mutex_lock(&cls))
dependencies.

PS: BTW, it seems after this patch 1/1 the locking was changed a bit,
so these previous tests could be not enough.
