The intel lawyers have identified the Spread license to be
GPL-incompatible.
Otherwise, I agree, Spread is very nice. If those issues could be
resolved, that may be an interesting option too.
(I think the advertising clause and something else clash with the
(L)GPL; I can put you in contact with the Intel folks if you wish to
resolve this.)
Sincerely,
