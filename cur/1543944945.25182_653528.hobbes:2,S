Hrm, I highly depend on that system being reliable¹, thus I would prefer a 
diff, if feasible at all. That way, any breakage may be embanked to PATA.
OTOH, I'm willing to help to get down to the issue (knowing that this is the 
only way to finally get rid of it).
Thanks,
Pete
¹) As a matter of fact, I suffered from way to many regressions in essential
   subsystems (kernel, X, nss_ldap) lately, not to speak from the usual
   calamities in peripheral areas of such complex beasts.
