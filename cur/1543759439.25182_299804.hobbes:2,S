You guys are reinventing the wheel a lot at the moment and I'm in the
middle of doing it for x86_64 lowlevel code :> Can we see if we can work
a little more closely - perhaps we can get some shared code going that
will allow us to handle these issues without stepping on each others'
feet? In particular, shared code for
- initramfs and initrd support
- lowlevel suspend & resume
would be good, wouldn't it?
I'm tempted to add setting and checking signatures, but I'm also in the
middle of implementing support for writing the image to a file, so that
could get messy.
Regards,
Nigel
