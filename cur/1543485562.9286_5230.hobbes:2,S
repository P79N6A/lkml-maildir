Recently I tried to play MP3 remotly with mpg123 which can play MP3s
through http protocol. MP3s were on my ftp site, and my apache web
server has got an /ftp alias to the root directory of ftp service.
And Linux 2.2.1 crashed ! I can't book the kernel log since it scrolled
for at least two seconds and after a reboot log files were empty.
But the bug seems to be reproductable (strange but the crash occured
with only ONE mp3 file here).
Server is Linux 2.2.1 UP.
ii  apache          1.3.4-3        Versatile, high-performance HTTP server
ii  apache-common   1.3.4-3        Support files for all Apache webservers
ii  libc6           2.0.7.19981211 GNU Libc: shared libraries
Client where I tried to play music from :
Linux 2.2.0-final, mpg123 0.59q
mpg123 reports illegal header.
When I tried to remount my disks read-only crash didn't occured and apache
simple die without any effect. Interesting but a simple wget can download
that file without any problem !
