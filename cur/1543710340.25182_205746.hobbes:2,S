So the question is do we cater to the worst or the best?  If I put kgdb or what 
ever on the command line, I would like to see the connection ASAP what ever the 
connection is.  So possibly, the command line parse part of kgdb sets a flag it 
it can not do the break NOW.  The late bloomer code finds this flag when doing 
the kgdboe or what ever set up and enters at that time.  Puts a little more 
smarts in the command line part, but gets things rolling ASAP regardless of the 
interface.  This, of course, assumes that the kgdboe or what ever has an 
independent way of getting entered as soon as it can be set up, i.e. its 
prerequisites are satisfied.
