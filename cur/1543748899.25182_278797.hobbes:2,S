Hi Adrian,

these functions must stay. They have users outside the mainline kernel
that are not merged back yet. Otherwise they won't be exported ;)

Please send a separate patch for all the RFCOMM changes, because these
conflicts with some pending patches and then it will make it easier for
me to merge them.
The rest of the changes are fine with me, but I like to see also a
separate patch for the CMTP stuff and cmtp_send_capimsg() don't need a
forward declaration. Simply move the function to another place in the
source code.
Regards
Marcel
