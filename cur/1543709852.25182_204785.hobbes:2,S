That's one of the things I meant when I said the docs weren't
quite there yet ... the dma_*() API docs don't address how
to achieve the ordering, or even mention that it's an issue.
Plus, there are definitions of coherency that include event
ordering; it's not clear which definition is intended.
Anyway, see the attached patch.  It goes on top of 2.6.4-bk2
and passes my unlink tests (the ones that haven't been run
much on recent kernels!) on several different OHCI hosts.
Other issues may be lurking, but this seems to fix a handful
of nasties that I could reproduce.

Fixes for some recent OHCI instability.
    - Never munge ed->hwTailP once it's set up, except when appending
      to the queue.
    - Don't clear control/bulk "current ED" registers when taking
      entries off the queue.  The chip may still be using the value.
    - Revert part of previous bk1 patch, which removed a fast path
      that makes a visible difference in some common operations.
      Removing it just slowed timings, and didn't fix anything.
    - Make the "unlink during submit" path behave better (SMP).
