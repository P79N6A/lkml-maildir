Thanks.

Yes, I was thinking about it.
I prefer as easily parsable parameters as possible :-)
fe. ata.dev_noprobe=hda and ata.if_io_irq=0,0x1f0,7.
It is a question of shorter command line vs shorter parsing code.
About a 2.6:
I want to mark old command line plus HDIO_DRIVE_CMD and HDIO_DRIVE_TASK
ioctls as obsoleted for 2.6.x and remove these cruft early in 2.7.x.
I hope I will manage to do it, but it depends on Linus.

FYI I have just done dynamic ide_hwifs allocations, patch needs
    finishing (pdc4030 special case), polishing and testing.
