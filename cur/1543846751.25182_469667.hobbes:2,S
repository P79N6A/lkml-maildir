Eric is already doing that in his patch. He goes through vmlinux
headers to determine the memory to load the various segments and then
also takes into account the memory required by bootmem bitmap (128K)
and memory consumed by initial page tables (tools/build.c). We can
audit the code more closely for anything missed and can also include
some buffer amount to be safe. 
The only flip side would be that if down the line somebody changes
the initial bootup code, he shall have to also acccount it in
tools/build.c. Having said that, its not frequent that initial bootup
code changes.
Thanks
