People ask us for this all the time and it just highlights the point that
people don't understand how BK works.  It isn't client server, it's peer
to peer, every so-called client has to have all the smarts built in that
the so-called server has.  
There isn't any way to release a stripped down version that makes sense.
If there was, we would.
