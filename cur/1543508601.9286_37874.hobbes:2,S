Hi Folks -
Is there any way to login to a NetWare NDS server under Linux?  I am able
to mount a particular server's file system using the ncpmount command but
if I could login to the NDS server I believe that would give me access to
the directory tree available to our users from a single mount point.
Forgive me if the question seems trivial but I have limited experience
with NetWare systems.
Thanks.....
