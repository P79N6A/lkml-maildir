See 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/slides/wvu2002/wvu2002.htm,
 which 
are the slides from a talk I gave at WVU and MorLUG in which I explained this
more clearly than I had managed before.  The section that's relevant here
starts at 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/slides/wvu2002/img9.htm

MOSIX (or Compaq's SSI) would certainly be a way of doing it.  It happens
that there's a particularly simple way of doing it with UML.  You'd partition
UML's 'physical' memory between the hosts, and use the fact that those pages
are really virtual to fault them between hosts as needed.  This would perform
particularly badly, but its simplicity appeals to me.
