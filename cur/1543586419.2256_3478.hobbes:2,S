Just discovered the above is not quite correct - it actually says [  OK  ]
after Configuring Kernel Parameters, and crashes on the next line.
Reading through /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, the next line is where it sets the
system clock. If I comment out the line:
    /sbin/hwclock $CLOCKFLAGS
Then the system will boot OK with 'noapic'. So presumably the system RTC is
not accessed in a SMP-compatible way without APIC.
Anyway, I'm not too happy about having to run without APIC - seems more of a
workaround than a fix. I'm happy to test patches etc if anyone has any
ideas - this problem I presume affects all motherboards using the VIA 694XDP
chipset.
Thanks in advance,
Simon Garner
