The pending patchset should make ATA ACPI quite resistant to failures.
Known bad boards can be blacklisted (currently only one is on the
list), ATA ACPI is disabled quicker if ACPI evalution fails, execution
errors are handled better and commands which are intended to help the
vendor instead of the user are filtered.  So, I think we have enough
safety nets.
Thanks.
