It wasn't that I was worried about someone calling down() under
spinlock, obviously that'd be a problem. However, if the queue_lock were
to be changed back to a semaphore (as it used to be, pre-2.4.16 or so)
this could lead to problems. I guess I was just wondering why the
tx_lock was pulled out of nbd_send_req(). It just seems to make the
code harder to follow with the overlapping locking, the duplicated
checks for sock == NULL, and it also means the tx_lock gets held
(a little bit) longer...

I agree, but I thought that the shutdown was causing different behavior...

Does the socket close at exit have the same effect as a socket shutdown?
If so, then I guess the shutdown is unnecessary...

I do like the combined ioctl, as it seems to make the code a little bit
cleaner and safer. But, it would also be nice to maintain compatibility
with the existing userland tools. Maybe if the driver could support both
new and old interfaces (at least for now), then users could gradually
move over to the new interface(s)?
