Well, at the same time as Linus merged -aa VM, he also merged
blockdev-in-pagecache from -aa.  This caused this problem, among others.
With blockdev-in-pagecache, the kernel thinks block device access is the
same as reading a file, so it imposes file limits.  It also caused the
problem that the block device (pagecache) and the filesystem (buffer
cache) were not coherent, causing e2fsck, tune2fs, etc to not work.
Cheers, Andreas
