It seems to me that you actually don't.
Since this is a *uniform* distribution in the range [0..2^N[, than any 
of those N bits must also show a uniform distribution, or the 
distribution of the sum of the bits wouldn't be uniform. (isn't this 
obvious?)
It would be different of course, if this was not a uniform distribution, 
or the range was not a power of 2...
Of course, I agree that throwing away 5 bits in every byte of perfect 
entropy that the kernel worked so hard to gather is just wrong, but the 
randomness of the result is not the reason why.

Not really.. you just get a perfect random uniform distribution if the 
range [0..0] :)
