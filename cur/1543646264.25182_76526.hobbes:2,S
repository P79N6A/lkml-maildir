That behaviour for list_del is new and, IMNSHO, bogus.  There's now _zero_
gain in using list_del instead of list_del_init.  akpm changed it about
5 months ago with a comment that says:
"list_head debugging"
so i think it's pretty safe to assume that this behaviour will not
remain into 2.6.  if you think you want list_member, use list_del_init
and list_empty() instead.
