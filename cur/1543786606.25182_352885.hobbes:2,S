crashing_cpu was introduced recently to handle one of the problems caused
due to NMI. I think we should not be relying on this variable. we get the
value of crashing_cpu by making smp_processor_id() call and this value will
be corrupted in case of stack overflow.
During OLS, Eric had suggested to either find a way to disable NMI after 
panic() or may be read LAPIC id. Reading LAPIC id seems to be more reliable.
I think mkdump folks already do something similar.
So, in short, using crashing_cpu might not be a good idea. Down the line
this varibale might not be present at all.
