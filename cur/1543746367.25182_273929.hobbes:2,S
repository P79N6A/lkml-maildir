Known issue - in the -mm kernels there are these patches:
selinux-scalability-add-spin_trylock_irq-and.patch
  SELinux scalability: add spin_trylock_irq and  spin_trylock_irqsave
selinux-scalability-convert-avc-to-rcu.patch
  SELinux scalability: convert AVC to RCU
selinux-atomic_dec_and_test-bug.patch
  SELinux: atomic_dec_and_test() bug
selinux-scalability-avc-statistics-and-tuning.patch
  SELinux scalability: AVC statistics and tuning
I don't know if these patches require other infrastructure from the -mm
patchseries, or if they'll apply clean to a 2.6.10-rc2 kernel.
