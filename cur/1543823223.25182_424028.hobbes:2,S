Developers use serial consoles for such things.  (I discovered
`console=uart,...' yesterday.  It works nicely as an earlyprintk on ia64..)
It's reports-from-the-field which are the problem.
A lot of these problems can be address by simple cranking up the VGA screen
resolution, but I discovered that I don't know how to do that - I've always
used `vga=extended', but that doesn't work on an EFI-booted ia64 box.
Does anyone know what the magic option is to make the vga console use 50
rows?
