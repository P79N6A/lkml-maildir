Kerneli.org loop crypto implementation (and derived versions such as Debian,
SuSE and others) are vulnerable to optimized dictionary attacks because they
use unseeded (unsalted) and uniterated key setup. Mainline linux
implementation is equally vulnerable.
Most, if not all, file systems have known plaintext. On popular file systems
such as ext2, ext3, reiserfs and not so popular minix, first 16 bytes of
fourth 512 byte sector is such good known plaintext. Byte offset 0x600 to
0x60F of plaintext contain all zero bits. File system itself does not use
that data at all, but mkfs for file system in question puts that known
plaintext there. When encryption key setup does not include seed, there will
be direct connection from password to ciphertext. The problem is that these
ciphertexts can be precomputed in advance, and if the database is kept
sorted by ciphertext value, optimized attack is reduced to doing binary
search of precomputed ciphertext values.
You can display precomputed ciphertext with command like this:
  dd if=/dev/hda999 bs=16 skip=96 count=1 2>/dev/null | od -An -tx1 -
Here are some samples using AES256 encryption and RIPE-MD160 password hash
function, no seed, no key iteration:

Of course different ciphers, different key lengths and different password
hashes are going to need separate databases as precomputed ciphertects will
be different if key is set up differently.

Yes.
If you don't have UPS powered box, disabling write caching of disks is
recommended when using journaling file system.

Probably not.
