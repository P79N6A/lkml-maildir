Adrian,
The defconfig files in arch/arm/configs are for platform configurations
and are provided by the platform maintainers as a _working_ configuration
for their platform.  They're not "defconfigs".  They got called
"defconfigs" as a result of the kbuild "cleanups".  Please don't confuse
them as such.
If, in order to have a working platform configuration, they deem that
CONFIG_BROKEN must be enabled, then that's the way it is.
Therefore, I request that either you leave the ARM platform configurations
well alone, or follow the advice I've given so that we can _properly_
assess the impact of your changes.
Thanks.
