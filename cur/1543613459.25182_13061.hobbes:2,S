It never hangs. It just slows down the i/o to ~ 1MB/s
also ... I started out with 200 'dd' processes (as the script I sent
earlier). The i/o gets stuck, and ... strange ...

It speeds up again when the processes start to die, although the number of
processes started has no effect of the outcome. After a while the i/o
stops completely up (see above lines 1,2).
I also noted a quite a dramatic speed reduction in 2.4.17-rc1 compared to
2.4.16. 2.4.16 gave me up to 50 megs / sec, wheras 2.4.17-rc1 only gives
me around 35.
