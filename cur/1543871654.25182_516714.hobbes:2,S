Close enough. ;)

This would be of concern for swapping out tmpfs-backed nonlinearly-
mapped files under extreme stress in Oracle's case, though it's rather
typical for it all to be mlock()'d in-core and cases where that's
necessary to be considered grossly underprovisioned. As far as I know,
msync() is not used to manage the nonlinearly-mapped objects, which are
most typically expected to be memory-backed, rendering writeback to
disk of questionable value. Also quite happily, I'm not aware of any
data integrity issues it would explain. Bug though it may be, it
requires a usage model very rarely used by Oracle to trigger, so we've
not run into it.
