I see the same message with modprobe booting my floopy-initrd. Finally my
installation program comes up, but after a while it dies even while
waiting for input. Kernel is 2.3.33 with the initrd and rd patch of
B.D.Elliot. Hardware : 132 MB, IDE-Laptop, Floppy, Atapi-CD.
If anybody is interested in the floppy to check the messages I will send
the image to him/her. 
Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards
