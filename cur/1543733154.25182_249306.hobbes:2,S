Actually it might be even cooler  to have a generic function which you
can apply to any file on a file system (or whatever) and which returns
you the  file system's capabilities  (can write, has xattrs,  has acl,
has multiple  streams, *not* has btree  lookups etc, as  that is *not*
interesting to userland anyway.)
