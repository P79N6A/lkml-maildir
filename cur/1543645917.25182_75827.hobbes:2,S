Yeah, I think the original author was a little imprecise in his description
of the semantics.  The freebsd flock(2) manpage says:
     A shared lock may be upgraded to an exclusive lock, and vice versa, simÂ­
     ply by specifying the appropriate lock type; this results in the previous
     lock being released and the new lock applied (possibly after other proÂ­
     cesses have gained and released the lock).
So I think what they're trying to say is that changing the lock type is
exactly equivalent to removing the existing lock and then applying the
new lock; it just happens to be one syscall.  Using cond_resched() looks
like the right approach.
