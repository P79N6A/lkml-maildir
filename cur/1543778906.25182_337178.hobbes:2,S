Unfortunately I think we're just going to have to live with that.  It is
right that fatfs behaves as it does, and unfortunate that some distros will
operate slowly.
For reference: how does mandrake implement this?  Just in /etc/fstab?  How
should we tell other people to fix this?

It's trivial to do in-kernel but no, I'm afraid there isn't a userspace
interface for this.
