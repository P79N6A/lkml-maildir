This is really problematic, because you've got these things called
"btrfs_item_ptr()" which really isn't a pointer, it's a relative
'unsigned long' offset cast to a pointer.  The source of this
seems to be btrfs_leaf_data().
And then those things get passed down into the SETGET functions!
Then deeper down we have terribly inconsistent things like
btrfs_item_nr_offset() and
btrfs_item_offset_nr().
Sigh... I'll see what I can do.
