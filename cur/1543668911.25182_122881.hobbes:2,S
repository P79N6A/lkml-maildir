I found myself wishing for C++ just for the function overloading so
it could be 'is_current(cpu)' or similar.

I was wondering whether the code I converted was running with preempt
disabled or not but didn't check.  (The very thought of preempt on
SMP scares me anyway, so I avoid it.)
smp_processor_id() is not preempt-safe either, since the id could
change before you even get a chance to use the value.  How many
thousands of lines of code remain that were written assuming things
would not change underneath them in kernel mode?

How about one for the whole kernel?
