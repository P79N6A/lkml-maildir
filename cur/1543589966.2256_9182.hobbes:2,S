IDE being less likely to hang than SCSI as it tends to use legacy isa
interrupt lines.

Doing event driver i/o after disabling the interrupt controller
hmm, I wonder why...

I don't know what a good way is, since there is a kernel panic it
should only be something truly fatal.  Given that reusing anything
that hasn't been designed to run in that situation is playing with
fire.
