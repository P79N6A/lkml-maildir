When you add it to the task switcher, it takes away a lot of cpu cycles
during each task switch and slows down your system. I think this was the
main idea behind _not_ saving those registers. IMHO, it does not make
sense to generally save these registers when nobody else but your driver
uses them. 
Good luck!
