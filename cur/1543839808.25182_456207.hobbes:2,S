There isn't really a difference. UBC counts usage of things. It has to
know who to charge the thing to but its core concept of the luid isn't a
container, its more akin to the a departmental or project billing code.

Add them later when they prove to be needed. If IBM send a feature that
needs it then add them in that feature. Everyone is happy it is possible
to add that hook when needed.

User space issue. Doing that in kernel will lead to some limitations
later on and end up needing the user space anyway. Consider wanting to
keep the container name and properties in LDAP.
