OK, 2.6.17 final missed Jeff's "Fix wall_to_monotonic initialization" 
patch...

I can confirm that this fixes the issue.  Queue this sucker up for the 
next stable release!
I hope nothing else was missed, but so far this is the only snag we've 
hit with 2.6.17-um.  Rock on!  Maybe now I can finally stop making new 
deployments default to 2.4-um.
