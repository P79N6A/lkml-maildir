Too strict security can also lead to less security than no security at
all. This is especialy true if security of only a part is too strict.
If system config files are only readable by root (or some admin role),
people will work as root (or with that admin role) to read them,
instead of adding some new config-file-reading group/role.
If users are forbidden to log in remotely via ssh, they might run
outgoing ssh portforwarding some telnet-like protocol in. If you
restrict what can be run on the computers too much, people might try
to plug in their laptops. If you force the doors locked and give too
few people a key, they will start leaving the windows open.
