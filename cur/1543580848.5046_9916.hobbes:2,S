Hi -
I've been away for a little while, but now that I've upgraded from kernel
2.2 to 2.4, I'm trying to port some modules that I use, without much luck
as a fair amount of stuff has changed!
Some functions/structure members that I'm currently drawing a blank when
looking for equivalents in 2.4 are:
superblock.notify_change
  (*is* there an equivalent any more?)
namei()/__namei()
  (arrrgh! there were one or two vfs changes in 2.4, weren't there?! :)
start_bh_atomic()/end_bh_atomic()
Can anyone give me equivalents for these under 2.4, or better, a pointer to
a page (or pages :) that describes the API changes in depth?
That's about all for now as it's hard to work out what's causing the rest of
the errors... :)
Cheers,
Alex.
