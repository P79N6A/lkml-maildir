Hi. I've just seen the press release drafts. Independently (almost as an
exercise) I was toying with this; are any phrases of any use to you? Dates
are from memory only (no hard research here) so there are all manner of
inaccuracies.
DRAFT 2.2
An updated version of the Linux Kernel is now available. The new "Linux
Kernel 2.2" now becomes the program at the heart of computers running the
Linux operating system, a free, immensely powerful and secure system
developed by a large community of programmers collaborating for many years
via the Internet. Version 2.2 builds on the industrial-strength stability,
data storage and communication capabilities of the previous version, to
give its users the greatest possible performance from their hardware,
software and networks. It aims at full POSIX compliance, thus retaining
its compatibility with Unix or Unix-like systems.
The kernel, which supersedes all others, includes improved or additional
support for a very wide range of new and old hardware. This includes
Intel, Motorola, Alpha, ARM, Power PC and Sparc processors, large arrays
of very fast disks, ISDN links, video and audio hardware, and the fastest
network cards. Additionally, the highly advanced networking allows the
kernel to perform virtually any function that a system administrator might
require.
Particular improvements include:
  -  support for symmetric multiple processing, automatically sharing the
     load between several CPUs in the same machine;
  -  drivers for Universal Serial Bus devices;
  -  support for IPv6 addressing (48-bit internet addresses);
  -  X.25 and AX.25 packet switching;
  -  infra-red communication device drivers;
  -  network file systems including NFS, Coda and Samba (Windows);
  -  international language support;
  -  many video and sound drivers.
The new kernel, and the unceasing development that continues, places Linux
users at the forefront of today's computer technology, allowing them
unrestricted use of their hardware's capabilities and full customisation.
After this release, developers will continue to make improvements to this
kernel, all of which will be freely available to the public.
BACKGROUND
The Linux kernel, when combined with other software (often supplied by the
GNU project of the Free Software Foundation), forms the heart of the
World's most popular Unix-like operating system. The Linux project was
started in 1991 when a Finnish student, Linus Torvalds, began development
(for educational purposes) of a simple program that could multi-task. He
placed his source code on the Internet, and was greeted by many
suggestions and improvements which were tried, tested, included or
rejected, and which led to the release of the first "production" Linux
Kernel in 1994. Today, an estimated eight million users run Linux systems
with GNU software, making it the third most popular operating system
with only Mac and Microsoft Windows in front.
The Kernel's development and success is unique in the history of operating
systems. Since its inception, the project has released its code under the
GNU Public Licence from the Free Software Foundation. This means that the
source code (from which the runnable binary is compiled) must be freely
available, and that anyone may modify it if they, too, agree to make their
source code available. Because many hundreds of people are now writing
code for the kernel, and because many thousands are eager to test it, any
proposed code has to endure a thorough thrashing from many hard-to-please
users before it becomes part of the kernel proper. Torvalds still
maintains the 'official' kernel, but, of course, anyone in the world is
welcome to modify it for their own needs.
Today, those millions of users, who include Internet Service Providers,
multi-national companies, NASA, computing professionals and home PC users,
find that no other operating system brings the power and flexibility that
Linux gives. A full range of application software (again, much of it free)
exists to enable a Linux installation to be all that a user requires.
