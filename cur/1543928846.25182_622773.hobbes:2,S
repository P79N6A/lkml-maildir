I'd be glad to, especially if you give me some advice on testing (.config
for um-i386 and um-x86_64, what do try that constitutes "UML still runs").
My patches are going into the x86/mm tree.  Right now (before these), UML
doesn't build for x86_64 or i386 from this tree to begin with.
Thanks,
Roland
