Hi Jeff, Alan, Jens,
Thank you all for the replies.  I guess I'll try to contact
appropriate people at HP / try newer/older versions of cdrecord.  I do
know the drive was working with 2.2.<something> a long time back.  
It's just rare I use the burner.
One other thing that may be relevent - the HP doesn't support ATIP,
whereas the Ricoh does.  Speculation: cdrecord asks for ATIP, then
used some default/random buffer contents, and this causes the HP to
give up.
Cheers,
Mark
