Subject: [PATCH] Buglet in 2.4.19's arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/9/10/224

Despite the comment, the return from direct check function was overwriting the 
value found by the BIOS check, assuming both are enabled.  Oddly, this was 
keeping my 2.4.20-pre-ac Summit backport from booting.
Please apply.
