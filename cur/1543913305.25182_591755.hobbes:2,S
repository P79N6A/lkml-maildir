First, check /proc/asound/card0/codec#* whether STAC9200 is identified
properly?  If yes, check the mixer contents (at best, run
"alsactl -f somefile store"), see whether "Master Playback Volume" is
raised, "Master Playback Switch" unmuted, "Front..." raised/unmuted,
and "PCM ..." raised/unmuted, etc.
If this still doesn't work, try to give model=ref option to
snd-hda-intel.  If it still not OK, please try bi-sect of
git.kernel.org/perex/alsa.git mm branch...
