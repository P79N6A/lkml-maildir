I won't insist on keeping code that I haven't written. My only point is 
that we use the code in set-top-boxes, where every byte is valuable. But 
  I suspect that there are numerous other places where we could safe 
bytes... 8-)

Ok.

I don't get that, sorry. The backend modules have functional 
dependencies and register/deregister upon loading/unloading. There is 
never a call from the dvb-core to the backend modules. Do I really need 
an owner field then?
CU
