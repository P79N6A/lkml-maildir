Changing '#undef DEBUG' to '#define DEBUG 1' in
arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.h is also very helpful.  Can you guys do so,
and post the 'dmesg -s 16384' results to lkml?  This includes the same
information as dump_pirq, as well as some additional information.
Note that turning "Plug-n-Play OS" off in BIOS setup typically fixes
many interrupt routing problems -- but Linux 2.4 should now have support
for PNP OS:Yes.  Clearly there appear to be problems with that support
on some Via hardware.
Note that you should have "Plug-n-Play OS: Yes" when generated the
requested 'dmesg' output.
Regards,
	Jeff
