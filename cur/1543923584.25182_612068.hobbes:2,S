I see.
But the arch name change does not affect running kernels on consumer devices.
And it wouldn't have so much impact on developers.
Drastic changes in the directory and file structures will have
a much greater impact than that.
This submission is a good chance for the new arch name.
New contributors cannot recognize the am33 glibc is for the mn10300 Linux.
