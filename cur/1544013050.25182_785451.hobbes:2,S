At the risk of showing my b*tt here...  I'm not very clear on memory
barriers, is this necessary even inside a critical region?  (recall
we're protected by the spin lock).  If so, does the barrier go after the
read, or before?   (Thanks for not laughing, however grins are allowed)

Actually, I tend to think we need an entirely different approach to
flushing, please see my post to David Chinner which outlines some
thoughts.  Basically a flushing heuristic that takes into account the
characteristics of the various block devices.

Nod, but that's ok. Having been one for several years I can truthfully
say that benchmarkers are a little crazy anyways... :-)

Nod, this would be ideal.
