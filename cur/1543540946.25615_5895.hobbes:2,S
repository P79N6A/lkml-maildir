I'm running RH6.2, with kernel 2.4.0-test5 (NFSv3 server and client
enabled).
I installed nfs-utils-0.1.9.1 using rpm -ta.
I installed
http://ftp.valinux.com/pub/support/hjl/redhat/6.2/i386/mount-2.10m-2.2.i386.rpm
I had to comment out #RPCMOUNTDOPTS="--no-nfs-version 3" from
/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs
So far, it seems to be working. :)
