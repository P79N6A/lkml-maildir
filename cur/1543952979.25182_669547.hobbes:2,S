The root of the problem is a call chain like this:

Some place in the upper (arch independent) parts of this trace the
code acquires an anon_vma_lock and holds it while calling into arch
specific code (there is presumably some inlining going on here because
the source doesn't have an obvious call from page_referenced_one() to
flush_tlb_range()).
My concern for other architectures (especially ones that require IPI to
complete the TLB shootdown) is that holding anon_vma_lock while doing
the shootdown leaves them open for some deadlock scenarios in this
code path.  But perhaps I completley misunderstand how IPI shootdown
happens (very possible).
