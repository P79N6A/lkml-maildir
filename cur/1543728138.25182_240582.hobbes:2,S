bk-acpi.patch is unchanged between 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 to 2.6.8-rc3-mm2
So it would be interesting if you ran 2.6.8-rc3-mm2 to see if
something else broke your system at that point, or if the breakage
happened later.
>From 2.6.8-rc3-mm2 to 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 there are only two additional
patches in bk-acpi.patch.  I don't expect them to have any effect on
your system, they are these two:
asus_acpi.c from Karol
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net:8080/linux-acpi-test-2.6.7/gnupatch@4117a219yRjkVomavWT8WoMdRg7KHA
pci_link.c - resume fix from Nathan
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net:8080/linux-acpi-test-2.6.7/gnupatch@41114fe37ez5dnzmR96KT2DHr4-elA
I'll poke around the mm patch to see if anything else looks suspicious.
cheers,
