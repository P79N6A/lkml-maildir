Subject: kernel 2.6.0-test10 panic, VFS mount root failed

Hi,
I keep getting a 2.6.0-test10 kernel panic when VFS attempts to mount
the root filesystem.
In my grub script I have:
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.0-test10 ro root=/dev/hda2
which is correct for my system.  The kernel then panics and tells me
'hda2' is not good and to pass a correct boot= option to the kernel. 
The exact message doesn't mean anything to me - it doesn't say something
like 'don't have ext3 fs compiled in.'
My RedHat Linux 8 system boots fine on the same partition with
boot=LABEL=/.  I thought it could have been that I didn't compile ext3
into the kernel, but after double checking, yes it's there.  That's all
I can think of, is there something else I might be missing?
Thanks,
James
