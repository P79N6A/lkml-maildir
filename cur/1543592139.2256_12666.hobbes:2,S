You are running out of virtual address space in the kernel.  Either 
don't map the whole thing all the time (this is really the best solution 
since it works with stock kernels), or hack up your kernel to have more 
virtual address space reserved for the kernel.  This will have the side 
effect of reducing the amount of memory an application can use at one time.
Another solution is to have the driver in user space, were you should be 
able to mmap a much larger amount of device memory.  If your application 
requires no interrupt handling, and can always be run as root, you could 
probably get away with no kernel support at all.  Just use /dev/mem to 
mmap the device and your dma memory.
