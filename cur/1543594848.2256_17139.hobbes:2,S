I think this is an unfair generalization.
I'm not even all that clear about what PowerPoint is (I've never
seen it, ever). I'm guessing that it lets you display slides in
sequence, but that's just from what I've seen of MagicPoint, which
someone said at a user meet was a clone of PowerPoint.
(And yes, the talk given that day was in fact done with MagicPoint)
