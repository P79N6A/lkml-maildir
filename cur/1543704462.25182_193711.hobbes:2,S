Confirmed here also... 
the latest working kernel is 2.6.1-mm3; the first non working is 2.6.1-mm4
The symptom is that the booting sequence stops right after "Uncompressing..".
I've cofnigured -mm4 using .config and "make oldconfig", answering when 
needed.
The only relevant changed config options are related to CPU, but I haven't 
looked in configure files.
I've attached both .config (working-mm3/not working 2.6.2-rc1-mm3).
I'm now trying to compile 2.6.2-rc1-mm3, but the problem is here from 
2.6.1-mm4 (not rc).
I've also tried several choices for CPU (386->P4), without any change.
The system is a P4/HT, chipset i875p, 1Gb ram
If more information/test are needed, just let me know.
