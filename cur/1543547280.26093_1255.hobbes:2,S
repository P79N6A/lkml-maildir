   Curiously, this field is measured in 512 byte units, giving a 2TB Ext2
   filesize limit.  That's starting to look uncomfortably small - I can
   easily imagine a single database file wanting to be bigger than that. 
   One way to fix this would be to add a superblock flag indicating that
   this field is to be interpreted in units of filesystem blocks.
We can do that as part of adding support for larger blocksizes, sure.  
Although at the moment, the block device layer is caps the entire
filesystem to 2TB anyway, so I'm not losing any sleep over this.  The
block device layer badly needs a rototilling, which is a 2.5 project.
(And sct has said that he would do it, in front of numerous witnesses.
Sucker.  :-)
