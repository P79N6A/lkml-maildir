 The i386 is irrelevant -- it didn't have an on-chip APIC and it didn't
directly support an external one.  At the time the APIC was manufactured,
i386 systems were inefficient enough not to justify designing glue logic
for the APIC.

 It's a good estimate, although Pentium systems support an external APIC
which is always good.  If the on-chip APIC is used, a system suffers from
the erratum as mentioned previously, if an external one is used, a system
is good.
