Indeed, if init is chosen for some reason, something really
strange is going on and there's not much hope for rescueing
it ;)

They are niced because the user thinks them a bit less
important. This includes stuff like cron jobs that _just_
push a system over the edge ...

I've thought about this, but the algorithms used are so
coarse that this makes little sense. Also, a nice+20
process is often more "important" than the nice+4 cron
job ... ;)

Not really. In the first place, the dynamic priority changes
so fast that it means almost nothing. Furthermore, once a process
has used a lot of CPU time, killing it means you're potentially
throwing away a lot of useful work that's been done.
(same for a process which has been running a long time)

*grin*
