Thanks.  I didn't expect it to be perfect first-pass.
Let me answer some questions out-of-order, maybe that will help.

That was my first idea, but Jeff said:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104681922317051&w=2
        I think there is value in decoupling the two operations:
        	echo "0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000" >
.../3c59x/table
        	echo 1 > .../3c59x/probe_it
        
        Because you want the id table additions to be persistant in the face
of
        cardbus unplug/replug, and for the case where cardbus card may not
be
        present yet, but {will,may} be soon.

Because the one field I'm not filling in by default is the opaque
unsigned long driver_data.  Most drivers don't need it, and those that
do tend to come in two camps:  those that put a single integer there
which is an internal table lookup for equivalancy, and those that put a
pointer there to something (which definitely shouldn't be passed from
userspace).  There aren't many of the latter (which is good), but I
didn't want them to break with the introduction of this patch.  They
should be recoded to to a table lookup, but that's beyond the scope I
wanted to deal with today. :-)
That said, if drivers implement their own write routines, I wanted to
give them a way to programatically expose what data should be written,
and how.   I'll grant that the current help text isn't programatically
helpful ATM.

If we resolve the above, I'll be happy to nuke them.

That's the only reason I know - so one can always write an app to
retreive what IDs a given module has, both static and dynamic.  I don't
think it's critical to keep.

Yes.

I'll look into this.  I did something similar in the EDD code, so I
reused the idea again.

Yes, that's fine.  I'd love to have that ability.  I did it the way Pat
wanted it a couple months ago.

I'm srue Pat will do a fine job. :-)
Thanks for the comments.
