Well, I cannot say simple. As I was not able to reproduce it with only
one task, code below:
(1) mlocks itself in memory (you can remove it)
(2) creates 224MB file and maps it shareable into memory (224 is
    for 256MB machine; I was not able to reproduce it with less than 100MB
    file on 256MB machine) (and you must have 224MB of free disk space
    in current directory, otherwise...) and unlinks it
(3) fork
(4) child process dirties memory
(5) parent signals child to exit and wait 5 secs
(6) child exits (hopefully...)
(7) parent unmaps data
(8) parent exits
You'll always get page->mapping == NULL dereference... And btw, if
I start code below on my machine (dual PIII/450), after 2 secs of run
whole machine stops - only ping and console switching works - and stays
that way for more than 20 secs. After that program finishes (killing
kernel if no antioops in filemap_write_page present...) and everything
returns to normal (if "-/+ buffers/cache: 28848  226920" is normal ;-) ).
  You can look at "
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/listit"
 for dump of "struct page"
at time when page->mapping == NULL was catched in filemap_write_page,
or through linux-kernel@ archive searching for 'page->mapping == NULL'
during last month, either from me or from Quintella.
