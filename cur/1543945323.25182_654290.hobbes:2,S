the register dump looks OK as far as I can see. Since initialization works OK and
the adapter seems to be setup OK reading from the register dump, I'm not sure at
all what is going on.
can you try manually ifup-ing the device and running tcpdump? do you see packets
coming in?
just for kicks, have you tried a different cable? or is the adapter consistently
working properly using a different kernel/driver?
