I know, sorry.  The version numbers in BK are not stable, they can't be.
You have to use the underlying internal version number.  If someone who

	bk changes -r<correct rev>
for that changeset I will figure out a way to have a URL that doesn't change
and send it to Dave for that doc as well as post it there.
