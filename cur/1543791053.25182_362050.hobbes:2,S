IMHO this wont matter because, IIRC, the preview window in mythtv 
doesn't even use xv... It's a straight x11 bitmap beeing drawn, after 
scaling (so it's very CPU intensive... It's like having the HDD without 
DMA enabled).
If the -rt series should work alright without DMA in the disks or with 
mplayer -vo x11 or with myth's preview it's another issue :-)
Btw, test for xruns with "mplayer -vo x11 movie.mpg" if you can.
