I don't see what harm it does, but the ram devices are full of
interesting data if you read them after setting them up. Either
this is a security hole waiting to happen, or somebody is being
very inventive with the fill ...
I did
     mke2fs -m0 /dev/ram2 4096
     dd if=/dev/ram2 | od -a | less
and had a good read.
