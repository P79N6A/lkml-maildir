Thanks Ben,
I've modified the title of this thread to indicate it is the chipset 
customers who are directly at fault. However it seems that every 
manufacturer using the Sigma SDK is making the same error.
The violation seems to be common amongst a large number (all?) Sigma Designs 
customers using their EM8500 chipset SDK. Liteon was the manufacturer for 
the product I have, but in the original thread on LKML it refers also to 
others.
Manufacturers offering binary distributions based on Linux as 'firmware' via 
their support websites are the easiers to check up on. Those with no source 
code included for EM8500 SDK derived products include:
Liteon

LVD-1001/2001/2002 DVD player
Vinc

Bravo-D1 DVD Player
Kiss

DP-450, DP-500  DVD player
Neodigits

NeuNeo DVD player
Dream-X

108   DVD player
Elta

8882  DVD player
RiMax

MPEG4 DVD player
The above is not a comprehensive list, just the ones currently distributing 
binary-only GPL products on their support websites with no mention of Linux 
or the GPL.
Other manufacturers with products using the EM8500 SDK may well do the same 
within their product, including:
Woxter
Momitsu
Brainwave
Cosmic Digital
Jamo
Link Concept
Mustek
Neuston
Shenzhen Skywood
Xoro
As you can see, the violation is widespread. I don't have the time to follow 
up on all of these, and in any case I am really only interested in being 
able to recompile kernel for the Liteon product which I own.
But it does seem like a bigger problem as the Linux GPL license is being 
broadly ignored by embedded manufacturers.
regards,
  Iain
