So could you explain what is stopping us from reducing the whole problem
to the bind mount problem? IOW have "a/" be a directory that acts as if
it is dynamically bind mounted on top of the file "a".
Is it just the fantasy of supporting hard-links across "stream
boundaries" (as in "touch a b; ln b a/b; ln a b/a")? I'm pretty sure
nobody wants to have to add cyclic graph detection to their filesystems
anyway. 8-)
What other issues would need to be addressed?
Cheers,
