found the bug that i think caused the freezes and deadlocks reported by 
Mark and Gunther. Here's the announcement of a debug feature:
>  - debugging helper: the /proc/sys/kernel/debug_direct_keyboard flag 
>    (default: 0) will hack the keyboard IRQ into being direct. NOTE: the 
>    keyboard in this mode should only be used to access SysRq 
>    functionality that is not possible via the threaded keyboard handler. 
>    The direct keyboard IRQ can crash the system.
it turns out i accidentally left debug_direct_keyboard default-enabled
... no wonder it caused lockups!
