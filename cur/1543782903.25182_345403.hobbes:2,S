Subject: PROBLEM: 2.6.13, Inconsistent kallsyms data

When I try to compile 2.6.13, using a complete tarball from
kernel.org, the compilation fails with:
-----------------------------------------------------------
  SYSMAP  System.map
  SYSMAP  .tmp_System.map
Inconsistent kallsyms data
Try setting CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
-----------------------------------------------------------
When CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS is set, the compilation completes
successfully.
I'm reporting the problem as requested in the configuration help
files.
I see that this problem has a history, but I'm not sure what
information I can supply that would be useful. If I can help in any
way, please let me know how. My technical skills are limited.
