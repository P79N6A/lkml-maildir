Subject: Why ask Sun for ZFS while we have ReiserFS4 !?

ZFS has some nice features, but ReiserFS4 also is a
good file system.
Why do we want Sun to release ZFS under GPL, while
ReiserFS4 is already available under GPL!?
I know that ReiserFS4 breaks Linux coding standards.
However, even if Sun releases ZFS under GPL, we still
need to port it to the Linux kernel.
I think for those who ask/beg Sun to release ZFS under
GPL should do the work to get ReiserFS4 to Linux!
Andrew.
