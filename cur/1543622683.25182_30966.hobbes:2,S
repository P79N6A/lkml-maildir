I hate to follow up to my own post; however, I managed to get the card
working well with the alsa cs46xx driver.  This would imply to me that
it's a bug in the linux kernel driver for the cs46xx (is this referred
to as the oss driver?).
BTW, someone suggested I simply turn the volume down using the
hardware buttons on the keyboard.  The poor sound quality is really
irrespective of the speaker volume.  Maybe this wasn't clear when I
talked about the "higher-levels of output".  I'm not sure about the
right vocabulary.  I guess it's the power output on the individual
frequency bands.
