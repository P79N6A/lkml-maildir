I don't want to argue me too. The only excuse I have to tell you about KDE
is that I use it while I don't know at all gnome.

Excerpt from KDE News (
http://www.kde.org/news_dyn.html
):
4 January Slackware to include KDE
21 December KDE-1.1pre packages in RawHide, RedHat Linux beta
and more on 
http://www.kde.org/kdeships.html
So I think kde is mature for large distribution.
Ciao,
	Riccardo.
