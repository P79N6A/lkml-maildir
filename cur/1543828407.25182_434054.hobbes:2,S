OK, that's not good.  It would be strange for the NIC to be aserting an
interrupt in that window though - the machine would end up taking a zillion
interrupts and would disable the whole IRQ line.
Still.  Ravinandan, could you take a look at fixing that up, please?  Wire
up the IRQ handler before enabling interrupts?
We still don't know why these things happened.
