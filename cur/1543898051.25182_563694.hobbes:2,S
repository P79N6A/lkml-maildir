Nope, I'm fresh out. If the reality is that you get no added value
with a vector over a scalar I'm good with either scheme. Looks like
you've done the dilegance. I see no flaws in your logic. I suppose
I could argue for the vector in terms of compatability with Irix,
but I'll leave that to those who might care.
Thank you for both the work and the clear explainations.
