I bet that is mainly because of CPU scalability, and being able to avoid
touching the buddy lists from multiple CPU's - the same reason _we_ have
the per-CPU front-ends on various allocators.
I doubt it is because buddy matters past the 4MB mark. I just can't see 
how you can avoid the naive math which says that it should be 1/512th as 
common to coalesce to 4MB as it is to coalesce to 8kB. 
Walking the buddy bitmaps for a few levels (ie up to order 3 or 4) is
probably quite common, and it's likely to be bad from a SMP cache
standpoint (touching a few bits with what must be fairly random patterns). 
So avoiding the buddy with a simple front-end is likely to win you 
something, without actually being meaningful at the MAX_ORDER point.
