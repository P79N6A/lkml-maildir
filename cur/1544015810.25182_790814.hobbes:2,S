I've never really looked at the stack slot sharing code.  But I think
it's not hard to see what's going on: "no overlap in lifetime" may be a
temporary state.  Let's say you have
 {
   variable_of_some_type a;
   writes to a;
   other stuff;
   reads from a;
 }
 {
   variable_of_some_other_type b;
   writes to b;
   other stuff;
   reads from b;
 }
At the point where the compiler generates RTL, stack space has to be
allocated for variables A and B.  At this point the lifetimes are
non-overlapping.  However, if the compiler chooses to put them into the
same stack location, the RTL-based alias analysis will happily conclude
(based on the differing types) that the reads from A and the writes to B
can't possibly conflict, and some passes may end up reordering them.
End result: overlapping lifetimes and overlapping stack slots.  Oops.
