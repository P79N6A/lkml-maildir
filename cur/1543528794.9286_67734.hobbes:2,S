Greetings,
Sorry for this somewhat OT question - I'll try to be brief.  I have always
noticed that on x86 Linux boxes, IRQ 13 is for the FPU and is always "1" (I
assume this is from probing or testing at bootup).  This value never seems
to change, so again I will assume that it is only used to signal FPU
errors.  There is no "fpu IRQ" on my Alpha, obviously it has an FPU as
well.  Is it's existance on the PC just some lame legacy issue?
