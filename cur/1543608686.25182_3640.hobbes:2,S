No arguments.  While we are at it, let's just state once and forever:
	FFS allocator sucks for fast-growth case
Everyone agrees with that, including me, you _and_ Kirk.

Obviously.

Whatever heuristics we use, it _must_ catch fast-growth scenario.  No
arguments on that.  The question being, what will minimize the problems
for other cases.
On-line defrag can be actually fairly nasty - that had been tried and
it ends up with a hell of tricky details.  Especially with page cache
in the game.  And "umount once a month" is not serious - think of a
_large_ disk on a department NFS server.  So I'd rather look for decent
heuristics before going for "let's defrag it once in a while" kind of
solution.
I definitely want to start with looking through relevant work - both
for the data and for information on _failed_ attempts to solve the
problem.
/me goes to dig through that stuff
