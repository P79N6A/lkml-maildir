Have you considered instrumenting waits/locks ? I had to do that for a
schedular/locks/events (not Linux based), by extending the structures
to include current ownership and waiters...  At a problem point, you'd
then have to use something like sysreq to trigger a scan of the relevant
data areas.  I had to cause an error and do a postmortem via paper dump
:(
