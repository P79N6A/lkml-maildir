this CPU can easily trigger a reschedule by _waking_ another task
synchronously (from within the irqs-off section) and hence causing
itself to preempt. I'd not say it's common, but it can happen in quite
unexpected places, so i'd encourage us to keep the more cautious advice
that is in the current text.
