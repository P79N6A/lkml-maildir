Is this good enough ?
(gdb) disassemble __next_eip
0x08048380 <__next_eip+0>:      mov    (%esp),%eax
0x08048383 <__next_eip+3>:      ret
(gdb) disassemble test1
0x08048390 <test1+0>:   call   0x8048380 <__next_eip>
0x08048395 <test1+5>:   mov    %eax,0x80495ec
0x0804839a <test1+10>:  ret
(gdb) c
Continuing.
eip = 0x8048395
*** src ***
void* eip;
register unsigned* __esp asm("esp");
void* __attribute__((noinline)) __next_eip() { return (void *)(*__esp); }
void test1() { eip = __next_eip(); }
