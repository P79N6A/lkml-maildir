I guess your idea is changing pci_enable_device() not to return as error
even if it fails to enable some regions. Is it correct? If yes, we need
to change all architecture dependent code (e.g. pcibios_enable_device())
to do that, and it would need much bigger change.

Many driver uses pci_request_regions() instead of calling pci_request_region()
for each region. That is, we need to consider the same problem at
pci_request_regions() time. Converting drivers to use pci_request_region()
instead of pci_request_regions() requires many changes and it would be
troublesome for driver writers.
