Do you have a pointer to the rfc?  I need to do some serious reading and
head scratching to understand what you just said.
correction:
I had stated that this was a recent thing.. damn lie that.  I started
a binary search to see (curiosity) when this started, and ran into it
immediately in stock 2.1.108.  I guess it's been there for a long while,
and I only ran into it recently.
Have time for a question?  I cut the ftp port stuff out as it seems to
be ok, and just stared at the ftp-data communication.

It looks to me like my box is screwing up on the second packet after syn
and porcupine is waiting for my ack.  Does it look like receiver troubles
to you?.. or is this just coincidence and tcpdump is being a PITA?  It
looks to me like it's my box's turn to xmit but it doesn't; likely because
the packet was munged and got tossed.  It looks like we both just sit there
and wait until my box gets bored (30 second attention span) and says heck
with it.  Shouldn't there be some....  :-/ retrans.... oh bugger.
(Gee.. that's exactly what Dave said isn't it.  We drop packet - porcupine
 waits forever to retransmit because he's a little bit broken -ding- 8*)
ok..
Anyone see exactly this problem on a _non_ isdn connection?
How can I find out if porky is sending a bad packet in a 100% repeatable
manner when timestamps are on, or if I'm stepping on a perfectly good
packet 100% of the time?  Is this another known property of this already
known to be broken stack?  If so, sorry for wasting air and case closed.
