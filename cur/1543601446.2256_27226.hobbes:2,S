When I run the cdrecord -scanbus command I get the following error;
presumably because my CD is not SCSI???
	# cdrecord -scanbus
	Cdrecord 1.8 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2000 Jörg Schilling
	cdrecord: No such file or directory. Cannot open SCSI driver.
	cdrecord: For possible targets try 'cdrecord -scanbus'. Make sure you
are root. 
I suspect you are right about it being a multi-session disk.  That
sounds familiar.  I just double checked, and I cannot find an option in
my Windows software to force a single session disk.  However, if the
disk is multi-session, why can the 2.2.19 kernel could read it?
Thanks
Bruce
