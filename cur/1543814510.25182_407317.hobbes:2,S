Subject: puting task to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before adding it to an wait queue

the function worker_thread in kernel 2.6.15.6  first put the task to
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and only then add itself to an wait queue:
	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
		add_wait_queue(&cwq->more_work, &wait);
....
my question is, what will happen if the timeslice for the
worker_thread will finished just before it add itself to the wait
queue?
wont it call schedule() that will find the task is in
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state and remove it from the runqueue? ( that what
schedule() should do no? )
and then how will the kernel be able to call to worker_thread ever if
it isnt in any list???
thanks for the comments!
