It only afects the *defaults* of various driver knobs that can be freely
modified at runtime:
without THINKPAD_ACPI_INPUT_ENABLED:
	hotkey_enable = 0
	hotkey_mask unchanged from whatever is already set
	hot keys from ibm-acpi 0.14 are mapped to KEY_UNKNOWN, and thus will
	generate ACPI events if hotkey_enabled is set to 1.
with THINKPAD_ACPI_INPUT_ENABLED:
	hotkey_enable = 1
	hotkey_mask = hotkey_recommended_mask
	most hot keys are mapped to something other than KEY_UNKNOWN, and
	thus will not generate ACPI events but rather input layer events.
You should select whichever works better with your userspace.
