Sorry if this has been reported already... If the kernel is built with
basic SCSI support in
a dynamic module, scsi_mod.o will fail to load because init_task_union
is undefined. An export for this symbol needs to be added to ksyms.c or
some other convenient location. Presumably this change is
architecture-independent, so ksyms.c is not the best choice.
