The downside of "disable-and-remove-later" is that it becomes
too easy to just re-enable the Kconfig stuff rather than just
fixing the userspace bugs.  Expecting userspace to change at
any point before it absolutely _must_ tends to be a formula
for userspace never changing, sadly enough.  
If 2.6.13 doesn't remove devfs, when will it really go away?
