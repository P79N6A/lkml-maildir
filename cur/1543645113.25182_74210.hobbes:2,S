Another thing to note from that trace is that many writes
went through the entire submit_bio/elv_next_request/bio_endio
cycle between the submission and completion of the read.
So there was:
	submit_bio(the read)
	elv_next_request(the read)
	...
	submit_bio(a write)
	elv_next_request(that write)
	bio_endio(that write)
	...
	bio_endio(the read)
For many writes.  I'm fairly (but not 100%) sure that the same
behaviour was seen with four tags.
