Subject: [Bug 973] Presario kernel panic with 2.6.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After a short interruption in testing caused by friends visiting from 
Maine I have resumed chasing a panic which I only see on my laptop.
Please see bugzilla 973 for the gory details of hardware, panic messages, 
config, etc.  
At the request of Zwane, to whom this bug is assigned, I have restested 
with 2.6.0-test2 as well as with the mm5 patch from Andrew Morton.  I am 
still seeing the same panic.
I believe Zwane thinks this is related to Synaptics code, but I am 
unconvinced.  I tried the akpm patchset both with and without Synaptics 
support and it made no difference.  
I apologize for the oops message going to bugzilla being incomplete.  The 
laptop has USB, but no "regular" serial ports, and I have yet to procure a 
USB-to-9pin serial converter.  
Thanks in advnace for everyone's attention.  I will update the bugzilla 
page tomorrow.
