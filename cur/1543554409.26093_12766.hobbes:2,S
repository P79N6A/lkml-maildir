1) Do not use gzipped attachments -- in fact do not use attachments at
all, unless the file you wish to attach is already in binary form, or
is extremely long.  Inline text is less trouble to read, and just as
easy to apply ('patch' has no problem skipping non-patch material).
2) 'diff -urN {old} {new}' not 'diff -urN {new} {old}'.
