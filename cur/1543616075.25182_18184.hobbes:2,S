I integrated Ed Tomlinson's patch today and have made
one more small change. In the patches I ran here things
worked fine, the system avoids OOM now.
Problem is, it doesn't seem to want to run the OOM
killer when needed, at least not any time soon. I need
to check out this code again later.
Anyway, rmap-11 should work fine for your test. ;)

Rik
