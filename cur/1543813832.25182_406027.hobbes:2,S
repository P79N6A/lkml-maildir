Very good eye!  My shame.
No need to say "probably" above, it was simply wrong.
By a stroke of luck, it's no worse than a slight inefficiency in an
algorithm only used when we're already going slow; but (if offset had
been signed, or not checked against highest_bit for unrelated reasons)
it could very easily have tried to access and modify swap_map[-1].
Anyway, thanks for catching that:
Andrew, please apply (but not desperate for 2.6.16).
