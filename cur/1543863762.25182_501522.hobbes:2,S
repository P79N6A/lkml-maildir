There was a comment in the mmc_spi.c glue driver at
<URL:
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/linux/kernel/671939#671939>
:
+                * some cards seemed happier if they were initialized first
+                * by the native MMC stack, not SPI ... and in other cases
+                * rmmod/modprobe of mmc_spi helped the card work better,
+                * even without power cycling
+                *
+                * FIXME find out what that important state is, which is
+                * not reset here... and makes robustness problems
I think I've spotted the problem, or at least a problem with a
solution that fits the description.  What's missing is "at least
74 SD clocks to the SD card with keeping CMD line to high. In
case of SPI mode, CS shall be held to high during 74 clock
cycles" (from Section 6.4.1, in "Simplified Physical Layer
Specification 2.0").  This is to happen before sending CMD0.  I
have only one card (of 7) where this fails, a Viking Interworks
256 MB card.  It matches the description in the comment; it
never initializes, gives invalid replies (with bit 7 set)
without this, but works fine with it.
The gotcha is that the SPI framework didn't have a way to
express transfers with chip-select inactive.  Sure, you can set
chip-select to inactive for a period of *time*, but never while
also toggling the clock.  So here's an implementation for that.
I made this functionality optional, with the updated mmc_spi
driver trying anyway if the spi host doesn't provide the
function.  So, no SPI drivers require updating, unless they
really want to work with mmc_spi flawlessly with all cards.
I initially thought the function important enough to warrant
mandatory implementation for all SPI drivers, but it hasn't been
needed before, so I reconsidered.  Also, some SPI drivers seem
to implement the chip-select function as optional, a clear hint
to this being optional IMHO.  I looked at the existing drivers
and went as far as writing proof-of-concept patches for them,
but as I can't test them, I'll just stop there and call that a
feasibility study.  The spi_bitbang looked like it could have
always can_cs_inactive = 1, but then I noticed what
spi_mpc83xx.c does in its mpc83xx_spi_chipselect() (register
writes only on BITBANG_CS_ACTIVE supposedly controlling the
clock) and so I think setting the capability is better be left
to the respective caller (typically just before its call to
spi_bitbang_start), and just adjust the various chipselect calls
i spi_bitbang.
Tested together with the other patches on the spi_crisv32_sser
and the spi_crisv32_gpio drivers, both using the spi_bitbang
framework though not yet in the kernel (will IIUC be submitted
as part of the usual arch-maintainer-pushes).
