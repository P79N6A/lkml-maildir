This is somewhat like what we have on audio devices (where there are OSS and ALSA API's).
V4L1 is the old deprecated userspace API for video devices. It is still
required by some userspace applications. So, on userspace, it should be
included. Also, this allows that one userspace app to be compatible with both
V4L2 API (the current one) and the legacy V4L1 one.
It should be noticed that are still a few drivers using the legacy API yet to
be converted.
