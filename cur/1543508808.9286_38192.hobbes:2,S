It is.  Have a look at 
   
http://www.linmodems.org/
   
http://home.telia.no/Morten.Rolland/linux/i4lfax/
for info on some projects trying to deal with this
kind of problem.

I think the term 'driver' is misleading; a typical driver
is a "thin" layer that interfaces the hardware and exports
it cleanly. With passive ISDN cards and probably WinModems
to varying degrees, we need DSP algorithms, link-level
handeling, flow-control, state-machines, command
interpreters etc. to make it work.
I'd call it "modem DSP software" instead of a driver,
if for no other reason to illustarte the size of the
task at hand.
The 'i4lfax' project views the driver as the access
method to the medium, and runs the fax/modem DSP software
on top of the driver, in a userspace process (ca. 13000 lines
of code today, twise that including tables).
