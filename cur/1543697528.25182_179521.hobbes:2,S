Use "make oldconfig" to re-write your .config and delete stale junk and
options whose depencencies make no sense.  For example, the ACPI drivers
will go away if CONFIG_ACPI is not enabled.
For 2.4.22, try this:
CONFIG_ACPI=y
By itself for full ACPI -- which includes HT.
And this way to limit it to just HT:
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY=y
Note that this config scheme proved too confusing and in 2.4.23 and
2.6.0 CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY goes away, and you'll get enough HT to enable
ACPI even without CONFIG_ACPI, as long as you specify CONFIG_SMP in 2.4
or CONFIG_X86_HT=y in 2.6.
> So am I wasting my time with HT?
Measure the performance of something that matters to you before/after
and then you can decide based on objective information.

Ps. If you run ACPI on 2.4.22 -- we support a patch supplying the latest
ACPI code for that release here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/
2.4.22/  This includes the 2.4.23 config changes above, among other
fixes.
