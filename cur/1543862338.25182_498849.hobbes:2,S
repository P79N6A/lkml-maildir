Hello Tejun,

I have taken more detailed dmesg outputs of three configs with ATA_DEBUG and 
ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG defined. You can find them at this address:
http://cekirdek.pardus.org.tr/~faik/tmp/ahci/
* ahci file is the output of CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_AHCI compiled config
* noahci file is the output of CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_AHCI not compiled config
* ahci-nullsoftreset is the output of CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_AHCI compiled config
but given NULL to softreset parameters of ata_do_eh in ahci.c
Also poweroff-config is the used .config file. Only CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_AHCI is
changed between them.
I am not familiar with AHCI nor ATA internals. So please ask if you would like 
to see anything more.
Regards,
- Faik
