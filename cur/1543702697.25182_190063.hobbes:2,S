Okay, color me as having no idea what's going on...
Jiggered things around to boot from the drive connected to the Promise
(hereafter the old drive) again, with a copy of the original test
object (xfree86_4.2.1.orig.tar.gz from Branden's Debian archives).  It
still works with 2.4.23.  Rebuilt 2.4.22 (didn't have any of the patches
around, and I'm 99% sure I tested with 22-final just before giving up
originally); that works too.  Shutdown and physically removed the 3ware
card from the machine; dug up the grub boot disk that I'd forgotten I
would need for this, booted into 2.4.22 again.  Still, it works.
Maybe it's because the Promise chip knows it's no longer needed?  :-/

use a memory block after it's been freed, use memory that you haven't
explicitly allocated, etc.  We C++ programmers have developed tricks
to help us deal with this sort of thing, in much the same way that people
who suffer severe childhood trauma develop psychological mechanisms to
insulate themselves from those experiences.  -- Joseph A. Knapka
