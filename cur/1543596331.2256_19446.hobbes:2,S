That's about what I did, except that I saved the data to a nfs mounted disk.

Probably not. I tried the drivers from 
http://www.scyld.com/network/
 , and 
the problem disappeared (thanks to Jeff Garzik for the suggestion). 
I haven't tried 2.4.x again, but last time I did (2.4.6-pre6 or so), it 
didn't even finish importing my nfs shares on startup.
In case you are interested, here is the output of the 2.2.18 drivers, when 
the card hangs:
Jun  4 16:44:34 siechfried kernel: eth0: Transmit timeout using MII device, 
Tx status 0005.

etc...
The driver from scyld.com did also issue such a warning, but only once and 
everythings seems to be back to normal afterwards:
Jul  4 15:13:06 siechfried kernel: eth0: Tx hung, 25721 vs. 25713.
Jul  4 15:13:06 siechfried kernel: eth0: Transmit timeout using MII device, 
Tx status 0003.
Jul  4 15:13:06 siechfried kernel: eth0: Restarting the EPIC chip, Rx 
24507/24507 Tx 25713/25721.
Jul  4 15:13:06 siechfried kernel: eth0: epic_restart() done, cmd status 
000a, ctl 0512 interrupt 240000.
I hope this helps,
