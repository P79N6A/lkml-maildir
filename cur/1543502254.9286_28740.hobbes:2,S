Working fine here on a compaq proliant 1600 w/two PII 450's and a DPT
SmartRAID PM3334UW/2 with a Raid 5 array using the eata driver.
However, I did have to change the EBDA Relocatable setting in the BIOS of
the card as instructed by DPT when I could not get it to work correctly at
first.  I don't remember if it defaulted to enabled and I changed it to
disabled or the other way around, and I can't take the machine down
currently.
