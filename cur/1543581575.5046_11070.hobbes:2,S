Dear linux-kernel mailing list,
I am facing this problem in linux-2.4.1 :-
RAMDISK driver initialized: 16 RAM disks of 8192K size
1024 blocksize
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
 incomplete distance tree
invalid compressed format (err=1)Freeing initrd
memory: 4096k freed
Is any body seen this problem earlier , any hint .
But this ramdisk works fine with linux-2.2.12 .
Thanks ,
Best Regards,
Jaswinder.
