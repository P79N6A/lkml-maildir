Alrighty then (this is output from lspci -v running under 2.2.18pre21):

Now...one thing I noticed is that Linux is trying to find this IDE
interface through PCI and it reports it on 00:07.1 during -test12 and
-test13-pre5 boot up (I can't get a dmesg output for you 'cause it never
boots...just keeps complaining about hdb: lost interrupt), but the IDE
controller seems to be an ISA device (unless I've read this wrong).
In case I'm configuring something wrong, I've pasted the IDE .config
portions here:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
ONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES=y
Hope this stuff helps you guys out.
If somebody wants to tell me a better way to get nvi to wrap lines at 75
chars (other than hitting enter when I think it has to be hit), you could
e-mail me (don't bother sending it to the list).
CC replies please.  I don't subscribe to linux-kernel.  Sorry.

...hmmm...Now I'm going to have to adjust my .signature to fit in 75
chars instead of 79.  Darn.
