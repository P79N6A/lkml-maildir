Subject: [PATCH] Clarify pci_iomap() usage for MMIO-only devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch updates the pci_iomap() kernel-doc to make it clarify the
case when read*()/write*() can be called over ioread*/iowrite*(). When
driver writers read this documenation sometimes it is assumed you just
*need* to use ioread*()/iorwrite*(). We have an exception so lets just
clarify this is not true for the exception.
