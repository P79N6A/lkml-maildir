The schedprof thing I wrote to track down the source of context
switches during database creation may prove useful, since it has
at least demonstrated where thundering herds came from properly once
before and is damn near idiotproof -- it requires no more than
readprofile(1) from userspace. I'll dredge that up again and maybe
we'll see if it helps here. It will also properly point to
sys_sched_yield() and the like in the event of badly-behaved userspace.
