Well I guess we'll need a per-thread-group execve semaphore to keep multiple
threads from execve'ing on different CPUs.  Or if my master kernel-thread
idea gains favor it could be pushed into there.  I'm starting ot think
that's the way - that way execve attempts are automatically serialized.

Neither do I... I was just basing me comments on:
  1. Victor's statement that MT execve was undefined (unless I just missed
     some of the context)
  2. My memory (which is prone to bit-errors every so often)
I could easily be wrong though..

It would make the most sense for it to just surplant the thread that
called it, I think.  I don't see what the value of having all the
other theads asyncronously disappear is.
