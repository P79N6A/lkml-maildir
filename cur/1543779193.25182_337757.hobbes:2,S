Since there appears to be some interest in these, I'll set about
converting the audio bits to ALSA rather than Nico's SA11x0 audio
driver.  I thought no one was using these chips anymore, and the
driver was dead!
I've recently edited the mcp structure which may make things less
awkward for others, and I'll continue moving in that direction
with this driver.
