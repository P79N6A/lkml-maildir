 It depends (as usually with Intel) on what document you are looking at.  
Based on my short research, the instruction has been retroactively added
to the list of supported opcodes.  Even my somewhat dated P4 manual does
not list it, never mind its predecessors.  It could have been accidentally
omitted or even buggy in some early members of the P6 family and this
could have been the reason for not documenting it from the beginning (the
case of FFREEP comes to mind).
