Subject: pcibus_to_node value when no pxm info is present for the pci bus

Most of the arches seem to return -1 for pcibus_to_node if there is no pxm
kind of proximity information for the pci busses.  Arch specific code on
those arches check if nodeid >= 0  before using the nodeid for kmalloc_node
etc. But some code paths in x86_64/i386 does not doe this --
x86_64/dma_alloc_pages() and e1000 node local descriptor (I am to blame for 
the second one).  Also, pcibus_to_node seems to be 0 when there is no pxm 
info available.
The question is, what should be the default pcibus_to_node if there is no
pxm info? Answer seems like -1 -- in which case dma_alloc_pages and e1000
driver has to be fixed.
Thanks,
Kiran
