I'd rather just skip the WATCH part entirely (or limit it to people already
in the MAINTAINERS list).  If someone is interested in part of the code,
they can subscribe to the mailing list.
Also, if the PATCHES-TO file already lives in a particular subdirectory,
I don't see the benefit of HomeDir, except to increase the maintenance
work.
Cheers, Andreas
