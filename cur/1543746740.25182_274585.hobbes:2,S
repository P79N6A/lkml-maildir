I dont see any practical problem with 2.4.x right now.
get_user_pages() wont be called on driver created VMA's with PageReserved 
pages because of the VM_IO bit which is set at remap_page_range(). 
Its not possible to have any vma mapped by a driver without VM_IO set.
But the network packet mmap was an isolated case, so I'll apply Andrea's 
fix just for safety, although I can't find any offender in the tree.
