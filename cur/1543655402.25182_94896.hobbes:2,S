It's very different. RH's parctice of configuring the loopback device
as something other than (in addition to) localhost (no domain!) is just
plain broken, as umpteen administrators will tell you. localhost is
in the root domain, and nowhere else, netwise.

The dummy device is conventionally used to provide a separate interface
that can be used to bind the hostname to when there is no real nic in
the box to bind it to (binding it to loopback being a no no). One
ususally does if-down ppp0, for example, with a few lines in that
brings up the hostname on dummy0. When ppp comes up, the hostname may
be bound to the ppp0 connection, but personally I prefer t leave it
stable.
"a stable binding point" for the hostname is another use for dummy0,
when the configuration is dynamic, such as in a failover cluster.
