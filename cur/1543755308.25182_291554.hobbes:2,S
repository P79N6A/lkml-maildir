What protects topdir from being removed inbetween?
Why is necessary to let the user create/remove files/dirs at all?

For the first version I would suggest to use just local_irq_save/_restore.
Getting it right with local_add_return is not trivial and I'm pretty sure 
your relay_switch_buffer() gets it wrong, e.g. the caller for whom (offset 
< bufsize) must close the subbuffer. Also buffer->data in relay_reserve 
may have become invalid (e.g. by an interrupt just before it).
You can also move all the rchan_buf members which are not written to in 
the event path and which are common to all channels back to rchan.
relay_write should so look more like this:
unsigned int relay_write(struct rchan *chan, const void *data, 
			 unsigned int length)
{
	struct rchan_buf *buffer;
	unsigned long flags;
	local_irq_save(flags);
	buffer = chan->buff[smp_processor_id()];
	if (unlikely(buffer->offset + length > chan->size)) {
		if (relay_switch_buffer(chan, buffer)) {
			length = 0;
			goto out;
		}
	}
	memcpy(buffer->data + offset, data, length);
	buffer->offset += length;
out:
	local_irq_restore(flags);
	return length;
}
relay_reserve() should be more or less obvious from this.
