I did say that the ftp test used sendfile() as the data source and
it dropped from 86 MB/s to 62 MB/s. Alexey has mailed me suggesting
the problem may be that netfilter is turned on. It is indeed turned
on in both the 2.4.1 config and the 2.4.1+zc config but maybe it has
a far higher detrimental effect in the zerocopy case. I'm currently
building new non-netfilter kernels and I'll go through the exercise
again. I'm confident I'll end up being impressed with the numbers
even if it takes some tweaking to get there :-)
