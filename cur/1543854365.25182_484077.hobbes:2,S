I misunderstood and thought __START_KERNEL was a physical address and
__START_KERNEL_map was a virtual one. But now I understand. Thank you.

My gut feeling said a big no when I saw that you replaced constants
with hardcoded values. But if the hardcoded values disappear when all
patches are applied then I'm happy!

Just to nitpick, isn't the 2M value used both in page.h and head.S? I
don't fully understand the reason why you are hardcoding, but it is
not that important. I think this version of the patch is much better.
Thank you!
