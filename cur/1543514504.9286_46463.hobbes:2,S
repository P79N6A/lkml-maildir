Good morning audible primates.
v0.10 of the OSS maestro driver is on 
http://people.redhat.com/zab/maestro
it finally fixes the memory scribbling, I hope.  It also has some minor
fixes that made it work on some laptops.  Please do give this one a spin,
it should be stable.
the next hurdle is to fix up the proper LRLR support so that mmap() (read:
quake) works :)
