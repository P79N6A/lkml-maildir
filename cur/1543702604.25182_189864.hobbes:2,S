On closer inspection, PPC has this:
config PCI
        bool "PCI support" if 40x || 8260
        default y if !40x && !8260 && !8xx && !APUS
        default PCI_PERMEDIA if !4xx && !8260 && !8xx && APUS
        default PCI_QSPAN if !4xx && !8260 && 8xx
which suggests that non-PCI PPC are limited to very old and/or
embedded boxes. And indeed compiling it for one of these (...much time
elapses...) gets us:
arch/ppc/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x380):arch/ppc/kernel/entry.S:
undefined reference to `sys_pciconfig_iobase'

I believe Dave M mentioned that gcc uses weak symbols similarly, so
they've probably decided that the necessary smarts to do what we
originally wanted are too much trouble.
