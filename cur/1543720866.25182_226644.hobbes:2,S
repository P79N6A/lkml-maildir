The right place to apply this patch is in video_usercopy().
When video_usercopy() is used in the ioctl() method, there is no need
to dereference the arg pointer in ioctl() itself, since one of the purposes
of video_usercopy() is to do this work for us.
Please have a look at definition of the function in videodev.c.
int
video_usercopy(struct inode *inode, struct file *file,
               unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg,
               int (*func)(struct inode *inode, struct file *file,
                           unsigned int cmd, unsigned void *arg))
What you have patched in your patch is the function pointed
by "func" above, which should already receive the __user pointer to arg.
