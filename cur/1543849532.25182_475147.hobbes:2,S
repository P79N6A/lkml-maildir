Also, it is actually the case that doing page-by-page cache flushes
can be cheaper than flush_mm_cache() on certain cpus.  Very few cpus
that need this cache flushing provide a "context" based cache flush.
On cpus like the mentioned hypersparc, there is no way to do a
"context" flush of the cache, so we flush the entire multi-megabyte L2
cache.  Actually, it allows to flush only "user" cache lines which
keeps the kernel cache lines in there, but still it's very expensive.
