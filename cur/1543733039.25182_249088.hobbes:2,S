X on GL will make this process faster
         Merge DRM CVS --> LK
         Release stable kernel  --> Picked up by vendor
         Release stable Mesa 3D --> Picked up by vendor
         Release stable X.org  --> Picked up by vendor
If DRM went into a kernel development model....
         Release stable kernel  --> Picked up by vendor
         Release stable Mesa 3D --> Picked up by vendor
         Release stable X.org  --> Picked up by vendor
This is the fastest model. Merges have been eliminated.
You may think that X on GL (gnuLonghorn) is a crazy idea. But
comptetive pressures from the Mac and Longhhorn will force us into
doing it so or later. I'd rather do it sooner.
