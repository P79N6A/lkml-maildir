Subject: [JBD] [PATCH] don't print all kernel messages to console
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Hi!
   Starting with 2.5.73 kernel spits all messages also to console. Problem is
in fs/jbd/transaction.c:journal_dirty_metadata(). There is call to
console_verbose() but current state of console logging is not saved. To fix
this you can remove offending call or apply attached patch. Please, forward
either solution to the Linus' tree.
	Cheers,
		Vita Samel
