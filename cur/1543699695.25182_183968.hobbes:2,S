A quick reading of the patch (BTW, your MUA is mangling whitespace)
reveals it's merely creating a local variable, which should have no
bearing on code generation.
i.e. the compiler is broken.
Bad code generation can cause runtime problems too; upgrading to a
bugfixed compiler is the only sound course of action.
