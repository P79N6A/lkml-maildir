The BIOS should not be leaving the device generating interrupts surely ?
If that IRQ line ends up shared we are in trouble at boot time.

We don't always want to hand off. Some setups only work in USB legacy
mode because of other bugs. Thats why the SMM fixup I did for E750x is
triggered in specific cases. We can do such things with DMI table
blacklists easily enough.
My E750x fix already duplicates some of the hand off code so we are
going to need it anyway and if there are more reasons for needing it
then so be it. I happened to only need to fix UHCI thats all.
