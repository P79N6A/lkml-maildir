Back in the 2.4.x kernel days I was advised to build the PCMCIA-related 
drivers (pcmcia_core, ds, yenta_socket) as modules.  There were 
supposedly problem with them being staticly built into the kernel.
Is this still the case?  Are there currently any drawbacks to having the 
PCMCIA modules built into the kernel?
Thanks.
