I have a real VT510 terminal w/o a mouse, but OK...
I still don't like to read and compare such numbers.

How are you going to like the output after some more uptime?
The record is around 1200 days I think. With a faster machine
doing a lot of work, you could just about lose the CMD column.

David Miller once posted a forks/second rate for SPARC that was
many thousands... these days, once might wrap once per second.
So the 31-bit space won't help you much. If you really want
this kind of security, you should make me an offer for my old PC.
I'll even pop out the OverDrive, getting you down to 25 MHz.
