Well, you claim it is as safe as possible, and it is not quite.

I can bet someone will get the fork() case wrong:
f = fork();
kill(f);
fork will return -1, and kill will kill _all_ the processes.

If you can find another uid to hijack, that other uid has bad
problems. And I do not think you'll commonly find another uid to
hijack.
And there are easier ways to get out of jail with your proposed
capabilities: you do not restrict ptrace, so you can just ptrace any
other process with same uid, and hijack it.
(You probably want to introduce CAP_REG_PTRACE).
Or just remove CAP_REG_XUID_EXEC when removing any other CAP_REG...?

It is not too bad; you'll usually not want restricted programs to exec
anything setuid... (Do you have example where
restricted-but-should-be-able-to-setuid-exec makes sense?)
