Thank you for your work on the inia100 SCSI card, it not so much an orphan, but a street
kid that everyone thinks they can molest.
Trivial bits from 2.5.45-ac1 compile:
drivers/scsi/inia100.h:78: warning: `inia100_detect' declared `static' but never defined
drivers/scsi/inia100.h:79: warning: `inia100_release' declared `static' but never defined
drivers/scsi/inia100.h:80: warning: `inia100_queue' declared `static' but never defined
drivers/scsi/inia100.h:81: warning: `inia100_abort' declared `static' but never defined
drivers/scsi/inia100.h:82: warning: `inia100_device_reset' declared `static' but never defined
drivers/scsi/inia100.h:83: warning: `inia100_bus_reset' declared `static' but never defined
I was working on the last three of those but the rug was pulled from under me by someone
with a grander vision.
Anyhow, I ran two parallel Bonnies on both spindles on the same host/bus and got this:
Incorrect number of segments after building list
counted 17, received 16
req nr_sec 256, cur_nr_sec 8
end request: I/O error, dev 08:10 sector 6685776
and then hangs the bus.
Would it be because there is no 'eh_host_reset_handler'?
The first run both drives reported similar I/O errors.
Works fine with 'patch-2.5.45' from Linus.
How can I help?
