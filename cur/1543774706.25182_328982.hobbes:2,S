Is your root filesystem mounted on an LV in 'vg' ?
As far as I know, this is a known problem - you cannot pvmove your root
filesystem.
But on another note; you should not have your root (or at least /etc)
filesystem on LVM - because the LVM backup/recovery files are written
there, and if LVM screws up completely, you'll then have no way of
recovering (since the recovery files you need to get LVM going are
stored via. LVM).
I always create a partition for / and keep /boot, /sbin, /lib and /etc
there.
Then, I create another partition and make it a PV, put /var, /usr and
everything else on LVM.
That way I can pvmove anything without running into the bug you
(probably) saw, and I will be able to recover the LVM in case it screws
up (which I haven't seen yet).
