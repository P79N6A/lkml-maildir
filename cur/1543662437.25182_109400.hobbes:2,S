Hi,
  I have written a new function in linux/fs/read_write.c and I want to make 
the function avaliable to other kernel modules loaded using insmod.
He is what I did:
1. Wrore the func my_func() in linux/fs/read_write.c
2. Used the macro EXPORT_SYMBOL(my_func) inside linux/fs/read_write.c
3. Have a signature of my_func in my_func.h
4. Include my_func.h in linux/fs/read_write.c and my_driver.c
5. Recompiled the kernel
6. Compiler my_driver as loadable module.
7. Brought my new kernel Up.
8 . Insmod my_driver.o
Here I get the error "Unresolved symbol my_func"
Can any one clarify this.
Thanking You
Shesha
