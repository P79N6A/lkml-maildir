Hi,
I got postmaster->sys_exit->do_exit->mmput->exit_mmap->shm_close->BUG->Oops
Is this a known issue?
Not sure yet why postmaster (postgresql-server-7.1.3) wanted to exit and 
it had nothing to do at that time. It appears some c++ compilation died 
with a SEGV at the same time although nothing else indicates an oom
(I have verified the compilation had enough swap).
