Well, depends on whether one FireWire node could expose multiple network
interfaces on the same FireWire bus.  I'm not quite sure if the IPv4
over IEEE 1394 spec, RFC 2734, allows this.  It is however possible to
expose one RFC 2734 interface and one RFC 3146 interface (IPv6 over IEEE
1394) on the same bus --- hence it might also be possible to implement
more than one IPv4 interface per node per bus.  On a quick glance,
unicast doesn't seem to be a problem, but broadcast and multicast might be.
Linux' eth1394 driver implements only one IPv4 interface per bus, and no
IPv6 interface.
Anyway, an IP router from FireWire to FireWire seems to be a rather
exotic application, especially as LAN to internet router or firewall.
