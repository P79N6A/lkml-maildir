Hi,
Here are a few driver core changes for 2.6.3-rc1.  The big one here is
the cdev changes which make that interface a lot simpler to use.  These
changes have all been in the past few -mm trees with no problems.
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
