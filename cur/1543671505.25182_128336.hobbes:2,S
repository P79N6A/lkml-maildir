Not a bad idea. Although my initial motives were to try and reduce the
number of syscalls for forking processes, I can see this as kind of a
useful call as well.

Heh. How about something like fdmap_set()?

Good point. Just a quick verify_area() check and then process away.

Depends. I know that on the one multi-user Linux machine I do use on a
day-to-day basis syscall overhead is painful:
  Calibrating delay loop.. ok - 16.59 BogoMIPS
and considering this is a multi-user machine with quite a few users always
tapping away doing quick commands (edit this file, run this program, copy
this file, ...).

Agreed.
