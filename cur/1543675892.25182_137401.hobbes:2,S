Hello all,
Please apologize: 
I checked the code and I finaly noticed
that this is a linuxPPC bug and that the buggy lines haven't
been reported in the main kernel tree.
So I will resend the patch to the LinuxPPC mainteners instead.
I promise I will check better before complaining, 
the next time I'll do :=)

Ooops, I didn't post this patch before, but I think someone did.
That's the point I wanted to show...
