Subject: different behaviour with badblocks on 2.6.0-test1-mm1-07int

Hi,
I was testing a hard drive with badblocks (from the e2fsprogs-1.34) on the
2.6.0-test1-mm1-07int (with Con's scheduler patch), and I noticed in vmstat
and gkrellm that during the write passes there are reads on the same drive
when there should only be writes.
I tried stracing badblocks, but all it showed was write() calls, and vmstat
and gkrellm showed reads only, so it modified the behaviour.
Has anyone else seen this?
