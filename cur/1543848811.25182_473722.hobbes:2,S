Flexibility primarily. So when we all decide to add a new event type six 
months from now, or add more information to an existing one, we don't run the 
risk that the existing mukevent isn't big enough.

The current event types coalesce if there are multiple events, correct? It 
sounds like there may be other event types where coalescing multiple events 
is not the correct approach.
