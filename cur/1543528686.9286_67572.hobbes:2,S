Subject: 2.3.49: unresolved symbols in pcmcia_core and rd modules

In stock 2.3.49, module pcmcia_core don't load because of unresolved
symbol "check_resource", and module rd because of symbol "bdget".
Exporting these two symbols in kernel/ksyms.c cures the problem
but I don't know if this is a "right" solution...
