OK.
Sorry.
I had to attach the patch, since hotmail does line wrapping, but I will note 
the part regarding
the more descriptive subject.
Also, some of the patches are one line per file, so I joined them together 
in one single patch.
I thought that splitting that into many tiny patches will actually be more 
annoying than
a single bigger patch.
Does that mean I should send those patches again?
