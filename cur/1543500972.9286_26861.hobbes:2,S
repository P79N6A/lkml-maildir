Just out of curiosity, how does it dump the messages out?
 1. Blindly writes the data starting at the beginning of the
    disk, so overwriting the first 16k of disk space with a
    raw dump file.
 2. Overwrites the disk with a FAT12 partition with one 16k file
    preeallocated to the first 16k of the disk, then puts the
    boot messaages in that file.
 3. Requires the disk to be preformatted as FAT12, and creates
    a new file on the disk.
Whilst (1) is certainly the easiest to write, it's probably also the
least useful, and one of the other two would be prefeerable.
Best wishes from Riley.
