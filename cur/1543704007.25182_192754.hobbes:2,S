Hello,
does anyone have an idea about following odd reset?
I've tried suspend-to-disk. If I'm using agpgart and X server then resume simply
resets whole system (no oops).
If I change resume so that it restores pages from higher addresses to lower then
it is all ok.
If I start restoring at 0xc0000000 and ending at 0xcee00000 then it resets at
about 0xcb8ab000.  If I start restoring at 0xcee00000 down to 0xc0000000 then it
is ok and system is back ok as well.
I have no idea why it depends on order of pages while interrupts are disabled
and I'm only copying memory pages.
