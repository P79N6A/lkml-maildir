Subject: 2.6.13 ips.ko delay causes mkdevices to loop during initrd processing?

Hello List,
This is an IBM xSeries dual-P3 1.0Ghz server box with an IBM ServeRAID
4Mx controller and 3 * IBM 18 Gb SCSI hotswap disks.
Base O/S is Trustix 2.2, manually updated with a 2.6.13 kernel built
from source and a mkinitrd-4.1.18-2 RPM
stolen from FC3 because TSL 2.2's mkinitrd can't handle .ko modules.
After upgrading to kernel 2.6.13, the machine stops at boot during
initrd processing. After much head-scratching I've figured out that
the "mkdevices /dev" command  in the "init" script of the initrd was
looping.
Hand-editing the init script like this:
echo "Loading ips.ko module"
insmod /lib/ips.ko 
sleep 10                <-------- this line added
echo Creating block devices
mkdevices /dev
and rebuilding the initrd makes the problem go away. So it's really
a timing issue. Everything is fine too if I build the kernel with
ips and scsi modules statically linked.
When failing, console output goes like (approx., typed by hand):
Loading scsi_mod.ko module
SCSI subsystem initialized
Loading sd_mod.ko module
Loading ips.ko module

(stops here... nothing happens anymore, system is *not* hung
though, typed characters echo, Ctrl-Alt-Del reboots)
Can anyone provide a hint here? I'm really stuck.
Of course I have two possible work-arounds, but I'd really like to understand.
Greets,
