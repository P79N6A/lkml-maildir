Subject: [PATCH] QNX4-filesystem qnx4_get_block() ready
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi everybody,
the QNX4 filesystem is about to enter the battle-field again.
I have replaced qnx4_readpage() by the new qnx4_get_block() and tidied things up
a bit (I replaced the qnx4_symlink stuff by page_readlink/page_follow_link etc.,
and lo! symlinks are handled properly (only symlinks containing absolute paths
are quite common on a QNX partition).
Reading seems to work now (also for fragmented files residing in fragmented
subdirectories)   :-)
I haven't looked at write-support yet; as long as you couldn't read properly
there was no point in trying to write, but that's next on the agenda (unless
Alexander finds something obvious that I may have overlooked).
As I realize only a few of you have access to a real QNX4 filesystem, I refrain
from distributing the patches on the mailing lists.
