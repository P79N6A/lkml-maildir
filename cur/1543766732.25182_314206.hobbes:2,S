Just to be clear, then: this idea is fundamentally different from the 
mkdir/cd analogy the thread starts with above.  And it misses one rather 
important requirement compared to mkdir/cd:  You can't add a new mount to 
an existing shell.
Several more complicated schemes that may achieve that are being discussed 
in this thread.
