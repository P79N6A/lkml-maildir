Huh??? There's no 'application level' involved here at all, nor any
'internal TCP/IP code'.
Chuck's patch touches the way the kernel Sun RPC client code (as used
exclusively by the kernel NFS client and the kernel NLM client)
handles the generic case of message timeout + resend. Why would we
want to even consider pushing that sort of thing down into the NFS
code itself?
Cheers,
