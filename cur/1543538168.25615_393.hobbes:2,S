Also, if anybody is looking at redesigning this function, I've found that
my cruddy Microsoft Optical mouse likes to somehow lock up the machine
(NMI oopser shows in aux_write<something>), especially when I push in my
keyboard tray.  After about the 50th time this happened and I lost my
work I decided to try plugging it in the USB port instead which worked
around it, but I still wonder if it could have been avoided with a
timeout in the aux function(s).
Not sure if this happens with all mice of these model or if it's just a
bad cable or something silly with my particular mouse.  Alan said he also
had a machine that did the same thing occasionally, but I'm not sure what
mouse he had on it.
