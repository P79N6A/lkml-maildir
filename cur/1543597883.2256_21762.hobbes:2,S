Looks good :)

Then your SCSI controller will not use PCI_MAX_DMA32 but rather that
particular mask? For block drivers, using 0x7fffffff for
blk_queue_bounce_limit is perfectly fine too.

Drivers, right. THe block stuff used it in _one_ place -- the
BLK_BOUNCE_4G define, to indicated the need to bounce anything above 4G.
But no problem, I can just define that to 0xffffffff myself.
