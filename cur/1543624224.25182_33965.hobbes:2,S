Old hd.o driver supports:
- 1 IDE channel
- only CHS mode (no LBA)
It can address disk up to 8 GB, but a kernel parameter hd=... is required
if in is > 512 MB
It can boot from 512 MB area at the disk beginning, i.e. the area that can
be addressed by BIOS in this mode. 
( /boot should be located there if using lilo )

Are you sure you need / want to use the old (ancient) driver ?
