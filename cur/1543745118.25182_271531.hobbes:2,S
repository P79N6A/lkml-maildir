ah, it's a missed reschedule:

note this entry:
>     5 80010003 0.000ms (+0.000ms): (0) ((1))
this was generated by:
                __trace(0, need_resched());
so need_resched() is definite set. The kernel should have rescheduled. 
The other trace entries corroborate this:
>     5 80010003 0.000ms (+0.000ms): (0) ((98))
>     5 80010003 0.000ms (+0.000ms): (2) ((5))
these two entries mean that PID 2 got woken up by PID 5, and that PID 2
has a priority of 0, which is much higher than PID 5's prio 98 [the
kernel-internal priority scale is inverted], so no wonder need_resched() 
is set.
