Something has to change in the way message queues are created.
Currently it is possible for an unprivileged user to exhaust all mq
slots so that only root can create a few more.  Any other unprivileged
user has no change to create anything.
I think it is necessary to create a per-user limit instead of a
system-wide limit.
