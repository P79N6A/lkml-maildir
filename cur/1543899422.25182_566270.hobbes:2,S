I agree that it is relatively unlikely to trigger (if you avoid
freezing the tasks that were uninterruptible for long), but it will
trigger in error cases etc.

I don't know how to do that mechanism... but if we knew where to trap
filesystem writes, we could simply freeze at that point, and at that
point only, no?
