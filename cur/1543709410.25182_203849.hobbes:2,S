We are not interested in that.  There are two entry points in the kernel:
void scheduling_functions_start_here(void);
void scheduling_functions_end_here(void);
that bound the area we don't want to show the task in in the info thread 
command.  $PC is the same as $ESP in the x86, but it is defined in all archs 
regardless of the particular local name for the stack pointer.

Stopping "bt" is a different problem, one which should be addressed by fixing up 
the debug frame records to indicate where the bottom of the stack is.  I have 
code for this for the x86, but it uses CPP macros rather than the gas interface 
for such which is rather restrictive.

No, this is not enough.  It needs to also know to stop when the interrupt/ trap 
returns to user space.  You might try the attached patch.  Be warned, however, 
that it requires a CVS gdb (I found broken code).
