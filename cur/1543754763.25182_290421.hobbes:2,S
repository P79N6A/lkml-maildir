Dmitry:
Here are patches with some delays. One never knows - maybe they
help someone.
Andries:
Only insert delays in the kernel source when either we know about
at least one person who reports that it helps, or about data sheets
that specify that the delay is required. Otherwise one creates
myths and superstition.

At present the comment would be
"Here is a delay - nobody knows why we are adding it".

If there is a data sheet that requires the delay I am of course happy.
If there are test results that show that it helps, I am happy as well.
But the given motivation was "you never know - it might help". Bad.
The present situation is that often 2.4 works and 2.6 fails.
Not because of some delay that is also absent in 2.4.
Often because of all those keyboard commands we send to the hardware.
Sometimes also because of ACPI.
