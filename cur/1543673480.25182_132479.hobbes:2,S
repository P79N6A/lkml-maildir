Joining a PAG can be allowed, if the connecting process can prove its
identify to the owner of the PAG. This does not imply that using a weak password
gets you access to a PAG that was instituted via some more secure 
method. 
In the example I used of Kerberized rsh, the rshd running as root, would
only allow a second connection to join the PAG if the second connection was
also authenticated via  the same Kerberos user.

No that is not true.  In a Kerberos example, the client needs a service
ticket, to prove its identity to the server, and then it delegates a 
forwardable TGT to the server so the server can act on behalf of the user.
The server can then use the forwarded TGT to obtain additional 
tickets for AFS for example. 
Since each invocation of the server would be placed into its own PAG,
(sort of by definition of a PAG) then each invocation of the server would 
have to get a new AFS token. 
What I am looking for is that the server can verify the identity, of the
client, then use previously forwarded credentials, such as a TGT or AFS token,
so it does not have to get a new token., i.e. it joins the existing PAG.
Note that the ability to join a PAG requires root access to place the new
process in the existing PAG. A user process can not on its own join a PAG.

I would say the "token" is in the PAG, so the new process would join 
the existing PAG. We may be saying the same thing, just describing 
how PAGs are used. Traditionally a PAG was created for a process and
inherited by its children. I am saying  root processes could add additional
processes to the existing PAG, such as in the rshd example.
