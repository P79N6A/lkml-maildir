Hi,
I'm looking at re-implementing the ARM page table allocation macros
required for 2.4.3-pre7, and have found the following:
pte_t *pte_alloc(struct mm_struct *mm, pmd_t *pmd, unsigned long address)
{
	if (!pmd_present(*pmd)) {
Why do we use pmd_present here instead of pmd_none?  The same question
applies to __pmd_alloc.
