With *old and *new being what? Raw fs-specific inode data?
Something with a version number or size?

FAT has attributes like "MICROS~1.HTM". NTFS has a 4th time stamp.
HFS has type and creator data.

Um, might there be a VFS already? As in "mount -t vfs..."?
There are already at least 3 XFS filesystems. FL_GENERIC is
less likely to be a filesystem name.
Oh, be sure to use a 64-bit inode if you return that data.
