I have found your patch and now it compiles but 'make modules_install'
fails with:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.4.20-pre4/kernel/net/sunrpc/sunrpc.o
depmod:         ___illegal_use_of_BTFIXUP_SETHI_in_module
depmod:         ___f_set_pte
depmod:         fix_kmap_begin
depmod:         ___f_flush_cache_all
depmod:         ___f_pte_clear
depmod:         ___f_mk_pte
depmod:         ___f_flush_tlb_all
I have upgraded to the latest modultils. I will install the latest
binutils and try again (right now I am using binutils 2.12.90.0.1-4
from Debian-testing).
