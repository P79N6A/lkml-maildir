The incremental patch contains a proper changelog describing the patch.

Done.
This patch adds comments, few small corrections and an appropriate
changelog entry.
Thanks,
Kalpak.
This patch adds nanosecond timestamps for ext4. This involves adding
*time_extra fields to the ext4_inode to extend the timestamps to 64-bits.
Creation time is also added by this patch.
These extended fields will fit into an inode if the filesystem was formatted
with large inodes (-I 256 or larger) and there are currently no EAs
consuming all of the available space. For new inodes we always reserve
enough space for the kernel's known extended fields, but for inodes
created with an old kernel this might not have been the case. So this patch
also adds the EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_EXTRA_ISIZE feature flag(ro-compat so that
older kernels can't create inodes with a smaller extra_isize). which indicates
if the fields fitting inside s_min_extra_isize are available or not.
If the expansion of inodes if unsuccessful then this feature will be disabled.
This feature is only enabled if requested by the sysadmin.
None of the extended inode fields is critical for correct filesystem operation.
