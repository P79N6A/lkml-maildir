Hi J
                  You misunderstood my question. Let take an example.
Let I have a msdos partition. No msdos files has inode numbers, right. Let I
mount that msdos partition. Then what happens, That is my question. Will the
inode numbers are assigned to all msdos files at mounting time itself
Thanks for the reply
