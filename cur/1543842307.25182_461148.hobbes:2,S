Not really.
What about multiple recursive bind mounts?
What about the initial directory for the autofs mount itself?
What about the case where a admin expects autofs to create these
directories for map entries that have multiple offsets.
As I've said before in version 5 I'm saying that it is a requirement
that the the directories already exist in this case but in version 4
people may have become accustomed to this behavior and right or wrong
this type of change shouldn't be made without warning to the users or
possibly not made at all.
