Sorry to be argue semantics, but I think it's SMTP clients that are the
major cause of spam.  Many, probably most, ISPs provide an SMTP relay
for their subscribers, and blocking these dynamic addresses doesn't
present a hard impediment for delivery of their mail to you.  None the
less, to say that people on a dynamic IP address should be *obliged* to
go through a relay is offensive.  (Not that you did say that, but I
think it's what you had in mind.)
