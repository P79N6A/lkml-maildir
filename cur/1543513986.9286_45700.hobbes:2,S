1) Right, my most recent patch killed those, ip_fw_masq is smarter.
2) It looks like ip_masq_user is passed a control struct, which contains a
user struct, that has the maddr in it, which is further relayed down the
chain.

Heh okay.  In route.c, it sets up the skb that is later passed to
ip_forward().  Since it's a forwarded packet it sets rt_src to iph->saddr,
and rt_gateway to iph->daddr, and then calls rt_set_nexthop which sets
rt_gateway to the proper address.  To me it would make sense to set rt_src
to the local address that it would use for masquerading.  The ip header
(iph) is passed with the skb anyway, if the source address is needed, a
child function can find it from there anyway.  Of course, doing a
ip_route_output() instead of rt_set_nexthop is not necessary for packets
that are forwarded but not masqueraded.

Ok I did that.  Just not sure if i broke anything else in the process. :)
