This isn't even an opinion, it's a fact.  If you are capturing data and
your audio handling thread does not get scheduled in (periods_per_buffer
- 1) * period_time time units, you lose that chunk of sound *forever*.
Some people on this list make the ridiculous argument that this is
different from more conventional RT applications because "they can
always record again".  Try telling that to someone who is paying for
studio time; you won't be running a studio for long.  Pro audio is
exactly like controlling a satellite or monitoring a power plant, if you
don't get scheduled in time, it's a fatal error.
In practice you only have to be more reliable than the alternatives,
which are pretty reliable these days.

Disable CONFIG_RTC_HISTOGRAM.
Then before you try anything else, check the /proc/latency trace output.
What's the max reported latency?  Is it significantly less than the
xruns?
