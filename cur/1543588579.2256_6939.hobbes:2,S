Same here: the first "su -" works OK, but a second nested one hangs:
 8825 pts/2    S      0:00 /bin/su -
 8826 pts/2    S      0:00 -bash
 8854 pts/2    T      0:00 stty erase ?
 8855 pts/0    R      0:00 ps ax
"kill -CONT 8854" has no effect.

I'm RH-7.1 and kernel 2.4.4-pre6 (with the via 3.23 driver from -ac)
