Al, we have back-ports of the latest Unionfs to 2.6.{22,21,20,19,18,9}, all
in 
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/.
  Before we release any change, we test
it on all back-ports as well as the latest -rc/-mm code base (takes over 24
hours straight to get through all of our regressions :-)
So we'd be happy to submit those patches to the latest stable kernel.  But,
are you talking about VFS/ecryptfs patches (which are in the stable kernel),
or are you talking about Unionfs (which is not)?
Thanks,
Erez.
