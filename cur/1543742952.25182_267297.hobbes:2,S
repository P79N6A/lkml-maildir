Just doing a quick skim, the patch looks good. Making a whole new file
for just one function is a bit heavy handed, but I don't feel that code
needed to be in main.c
My only nit would be to save the tabs and switch the code from:
if (preset_lpj) {
	newstuff
} else {
	oldstuff
}
to
if (preset_lpj) {
	newstuff
	return
}
oldstuff
thanks
