Hi,
 I have one doubt.
  There is a list of the devices(net_device{} structures) maintained in kernel which has all the interfaces initialised by that time. This list is refrenced by dev_base variable.
 I need following info
1) does kernel maintain a global variable which keeps the count of net_device{} in above list?
2) Is this list modified(net_device{} added or deleted ) once it's initialised at boot time?
PLEASE reply to my PERSONAL account. I haven't subscribed to this mailing list.
thanks & regards,
Deepika
