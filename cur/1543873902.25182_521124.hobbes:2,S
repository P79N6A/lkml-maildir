Wasn't the point of RSDL to get rid of the auto-nice, because it caused 
starvation, unpredictable behaviour and other problems?
Anyway, I think it's a good thing we keep having a look at mike's problem, but 
it's not clear to me how far he got in solving it. Does the latest patch 
solve the interactivity problem, providing X is niced -10 (or something)??? 
If it does, I think that's the solution - at least until the X ppl fix X 
itself. Distributions can just go back renicing X (they did that before, 
after all), and the biggest problem is fixed. Then all other users can have 
the improvements RSDL offers, the developers can rejoice over the simpler and 
cleaner design and code, and everybody is happy.
If it doesn't solve the problem, more work is in order. I think ignoring a 
clear regression to mainline, no matter how rare, isn't smart. It might 
indicate an underlying problem, and even if it doesn't - you don't want ppl 
complaining the new kernel isn't interactive anymore or something...
