allocate a 1 gig block, but store it in an int array?  That's wrong.

You alter n, but then always only set mem[i], without varying i.
Your program is buggy, and memleaks.
Plus, the kernel uses overcommit by default, and since you aren't actually
touching the memory you are allocating, you are only limited by the address
space size allowed per process(depends on how you configured the kernel).
