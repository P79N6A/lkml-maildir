Hmm. Usually this is user error.
Certain bootloaders such as System Commander XOR the partition type
with 0x10 in order to hide the partition. (OS/2 BM also uses this
technique, and changes 1,4,6,7 into 11,14,16,17 (hex).)
So, I tend to believe that people reporting a change from
0xa5 to 0xb5 use e.g., System Commander, and that there is
not necessarily a connection with the installation of RedHat.
(Or maybe RedHat changed the active partition without undoing
the XOR.)
