The whole point is that we try to swap adjacent virtual pages to
adjacent swap entries, so there is a good chance that nearby swap
entries are going to be useful when we page them back in again.  Given
that adjacent swap entries on a swap partition are guaranteed to be
physically contiguous, it costs very little to swap in several nearby
elements at the same time, and we get a good chance of reading in useful
pages.

There is no aging on the page cache at all other than the PG_referenced
bit.
