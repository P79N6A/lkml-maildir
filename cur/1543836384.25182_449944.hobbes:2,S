Ok.  This pfn_valid check needs to be inserted somewhere in the code
path for sparsemem hotadd.
with a debug statement in add_memory
Hotplug Mem Device

The box doesn't boot.   I am going to drop this patch and see about the
rest of the set.  (They seem sane and look ok but I want to test)
 The kernel needs to protect against bad calls to add_memory (and/or the
acpi driver needs to correctly id devices?)
