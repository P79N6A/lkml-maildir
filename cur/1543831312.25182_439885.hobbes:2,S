What is the point of using a non-zero logical cpu id?
I don't care about the apic id or the equivalent.
There are cases like machine_shutdown where we care about who
the boot cpu is so we can reboot on that cpu.  As far as I know 
the kernel has not abstraction to describe the boot cpu
except for giving it logical cpu id 0.  Has an abstraction
been added that I'm not aware of?
