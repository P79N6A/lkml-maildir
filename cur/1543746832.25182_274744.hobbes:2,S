Yeah. Sorry. Also, just noticed that this patch seemed
to work because I overlooked the unsigned bit, makeing my
hack not go though sanitize - which changes eb->state and 
thus does not get back to the ED_UNLINK path. Duh... I must
have been tired.

It's probably a linux-wlan-ng issue... What do you think 
of these logs ?
#resume logs... 
#disconnecting the stick:
usb 4-1: USB disconnect, address 2
ohci_hcd 0001:10:1b.1: IRQ INTR_SF lossage
hfa384x_usbin_callback: Fatal, failed to resubmit rx_urb. error=-19
hfa384x_dorrid: ctlx failure=REQ_TIMEOUT
prism2sta_mlmerequest: Failed to read eth1 statistics: error=-5
#reconnecting the stick:
usb 4-1: new full speed USB device using address 3
usb 4-1: control timeout on ep0out
maybe the lwlan driver should catch these and kill the urbs or
something? 
Thanks for your help, I'm not an expert at all in the usb world...
