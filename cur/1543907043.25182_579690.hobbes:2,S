Hello,
I'd like to have some suggestions from you about how I can implement
the "dynamic boot logo" feature in Linux reading the logo image from
the flash memory.
In my custom board, using u-boot I read a compressed BMP from the
flash memory and then I use it to display the logo, so users just have
to change flash content in order to change their boot logo without
recompiling u-boot.
Could it be possible in Linux also? Which could be, in your opinion,
the best way to solve this problem?
Thanks in advance,
Rodolfo
