fsync_dev(dev != 0) is easy, you can ignore the dirty flag
and call commit_super on the proper device.
But, the loop in sync_supers(dev == 0) is harder, it expects
some flag it can check, and it expects the callback to the FS
will clear that flag.  Adding a new flag seemed like more fun
than redoing the locking and super walk.  I'm curious to hear what 
Al thinks of it though.
