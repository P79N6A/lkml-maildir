Hi,
Currently swsusp frees as much memory as possible during suspend.  This slows
down the suspend and causes the system to be slow after resume due to
the swapping-in activity.  The following series of patches is designed to
change this behavior so that swsusp will free only as much memory as necessary
to complete the suspend.
The patches have been acked by Pavel (modulo some minor issues related to
the naming of constants, formatting etc. that are hopefully fixed now).
Please consider for applying.
Greetings,
Rafael
