Thanks Alan.
Should I understand from Alan words that locking is not possible (or it's
wrong) with 2.0.36 but it's ok _just_ among 2.2.x kernels?
Is there any difference between knfsd and nfsd regarding locking
capabilities? I understand it doesn't, am I wrong?
BTW, I tried to understand what knfsd package really does (to use kernel
nfs) and differences with u/nfsd, I am depressed...
Thanks.
