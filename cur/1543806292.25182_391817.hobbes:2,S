Hmmm, think this is something everyone could use...

Sounds great to me... So the verification if the device is enabled before 
could be completely removed from my and probably others code...

Hmmm, i don't know what happens if a boot enabled device is disabled, but 
from my point of view i would start at 1 :-D
Probably also the probing function could also enable the device, so the 
subsystems don't have to do it on there own? But because i don't know PCI 
stuff very well i don't know if this makes sense at all...
Thank you very much!
