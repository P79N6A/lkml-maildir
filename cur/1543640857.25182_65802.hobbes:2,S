That would be nice.  I do admit it is hard to trigger if you don't do
it deliberately. 
The x86 BIOS specifications say only the boot devices must be
initialized, before the BIOS gives up control.  A more likely
reproducer is a plug-in ata controller that the BIOS does not
recognize, and the kernel does.

Throwing an error and giving up would certainly be a safe response,
though it is a strange way to handle in spec hardware and firmware
behavior.  On the other hand it is a rare enough case deliberately not
coping with it is probably fine.
