How is swapping USB devices while suspended unreasonable?  Come to  
think of it, I did it inadvertently about 15 minutes ago with my  
PowerBook (while booted into Mac OS).  I had a USB key that I was  
copying a file to for someone.  After shutting the lid, I unplugged  
mouse, USB key, and power block.  About 30 minutes later I had  
somebody else with a key who wanted to give me a file.  I had the key  
plugged in before the laptop was finished waking up from sleep.  Now,  
I don't know for certain that neither key had a serial number, but  
the two I have here in my hand certainly don't, and I could _easily_  
see somebody swapping USB keys not knowing that they're "not supposed  
to do that" and getting massive data corruption when the filesystem  
reads and writes pages from a completely different block device.

Did you read what I wrote?  People don't generally expect to randomly  
plug and unplug SCSI drives whenever they feel like it.  They _do_  
expect to randomly plug and unplug USB drives, mice, keyboards,  
tablets, network adapters, etc, because _everything_ supports such  
random plugging.
Creating an extremely odd and hard to predict failure mode (when you  
reconnect USB devices while suspended on hardware that doesn't  
support proper USB suspend) with a high probability of causing data  
corruption or crashes is wrong.  Especially since you could easily  
teach users that "You need to eject USB things before you sleep the  
computer _or_ just fix the kernel to do it for you.  That's probably  
something we should be doing for all network filesystems anyways.
