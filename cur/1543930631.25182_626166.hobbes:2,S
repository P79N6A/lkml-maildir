Hi,
I am reading the source code of block I/O layer, and now seeing there
saying "ordering by draining" or "ordering by tag" in
include/blkdev.h,and the comments in that file says: "Hardbarrier is
supported with one of the following methods", but what do these two
methods exactly mean?
Thanks
Regards
Jason
