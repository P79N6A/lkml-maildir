The "off" state is always considered S5.  Adding wake devices does not make
the state S5.

S5 wake devices can be a very fuzzy area.  In general, the ACPI spec
recommends that wake capabilities are enabled before halting the system.
Therefore, your network card driver may need to specifically handle this.
For starters, we should probably look at "lspci -vv".  I'm assuming your
network card is PCI.  This will allow us to see if it's capable of waking
from D3-cold, the state it will most likely be in during S5.
I would also check your BIOS configuration and see if it's possible to
specifically enable wake-on-lan.  Let me know if this helps.
Finally, what kernel version are you using?
Thanks,
Adam
