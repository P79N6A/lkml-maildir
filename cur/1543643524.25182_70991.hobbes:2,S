Right, this isn't allowed to avoid eating kernel resources
without getting anything done.
Solution is to always compile an interpreter or to write 
a wrapper in C, which is compiled and calls the perl interpreter
with your perl script. This wrapper would be ANSI-C with really
basic POSIX extensions and should thus be as portable as perl ;-)
So you hide the indirection from the kernel this way.
Of course you now define the wrapper as the interpreter for your
perl scripts.
Hope that helps.

Ingo Oeser
