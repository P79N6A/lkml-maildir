As I mentioned previously on this list, I noticed the problem first when
I moved to 2.6.7-bk20, but when I tried to investigate, it disappeared
and never came back (thus, my summary is largely based on reports by
others). I attributed it to some intermittent hardware problem until
someone else reported it (see lkml thread: "via-rhine breaks with recent
Linus kernels : probe of 0000:00:09.0").
The problem started in mainline between 2.6.7 and 2.6.7-bk20. It does not
exist in the -mm series which contains a later version of via-rhine. IOW,
updating mainline to the latest version of via-rhine would presumably
fix the problem but it might introduce new problems and we'd never know
what the bug was and if it was actually fixed or just masked.
I hate having via-rhine broken in mainline, but I'm busy with other
stuff and I can't reproduce the problem anymore, so basically I am
waiting to hear back from Jesper Juhl who volunteered to find the patch
that makes the difference between mainline and -mm.
