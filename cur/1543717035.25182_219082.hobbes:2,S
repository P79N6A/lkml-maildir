Well, I've been using this very command line for months, and it worked fine 
before 2.6.6-rc3-mm1.  Anyway, according to Documentation/serial-console.txt:
"You can specify multiple console= options on the kernel command line.
_Output_ _will_ _appear_ _on_ _all_ _of_ _them_ [emphasis mine]. The last 
device will be used when you open /dev/console. So, for example:
        console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0
defines that opening /dev/console will get you the current foreground
virtual console, and kernel messages will appear on both the VGA
console and the 2nd serial port (ttyS1 or COM2) at 9600 baud."
And that's exactly what I need.  So, the syntax etc. might have changed, but 
shouldn't it be documented accordingly, then?
