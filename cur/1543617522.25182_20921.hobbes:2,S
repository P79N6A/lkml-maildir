text/plain is fine - it has all the properties a non-attachment has.

Absolutely not.  When I open my mail-client, and somebody has sent me 20
patches, I want to _see_ 20 mails. That way I can select from them, and
the mailreader clearly indicates which ones I've read, etc etc.
Multiple attachements have no advantages, and have several disadvantages.

Sending large patches to public lists tends to be a mistake in the first
place. It just irritates the people who pay for bandwidth and do not want
to apply patches off the list.
