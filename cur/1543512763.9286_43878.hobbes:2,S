No such luck.  We don't take the mm semaphore in any of those places: we
already hold it.  The mmap() operation itself takes the semaphore, and
it _certainly_ allocates memory.  You could allow take it shared and
promote it later once the memory has been allocated, but that will just
open up a new class of promotion deadlocks.  Or you could drop and
retake after the allocations, but then you lose the protection of the
semaphore and you have to back and revalidate your vma once you have got
the exclusive lock (which _is_ possible, especially with a generation
number in the vma, but it's hideously ugly).
That's exactly why taking the semaphore in the swapper is so dangerous.

Yes: the PF_MEMALLOC flag sees to that.
