-mm or -ac are "private trees", albeit very credible and at least -mm is
experimental.
Linux is now 10 times as big as it was a few years ago, OK tools are better,
but there is so much important work like PM waiting.
If Linus or Andrew and peers said, OK bootsplash, or kgdb or whatever
is nice "enough",  but I do not have time to deal with it, put it into the -nice tree,
it would be "official" enough.
And if for that matter all of swsusp would end up in _the_  -nice tree
(not crippled of course), that would be (_speaking_for_myself)
(sorry Nigel, should you disagree) also OK.
Then after all, -nice can then be much nicer than -Linus without many fights
and accomplishing more than ever ;).

As this may be another religious war, I'll give up.

Fine by me as long as it works.
Guess Nigel will come up with a spec soon and then it has to be decided
what functions you want in -Linus.
I'll be traveling a few days and may be slower to respond.
