Hi,
I have a regression to report: my notebook (HP Compaq nx7000) reboots
after reading /proc/acpi/battery/C11F/state. It's pseudo -
reproduceable, occurs around every second access.
please contact me for further information (and what information would be
needed to fix this bug), I will try to compile older kernel versions to
find the corresponding acpi update  this annoying bug (but it happens
for at least one month by now).
