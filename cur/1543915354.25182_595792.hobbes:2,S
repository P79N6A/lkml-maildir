We can compress all the different sections of the firmware.  Currently,
we only compress the biggest chunks and the rest are uncompressed.
These zeros should compress to almost nothing.  But I agree that the
firmware is still big.

Matching the correct version of the firmware with the driver is the main
issue.
David, what's your opinion on this?
