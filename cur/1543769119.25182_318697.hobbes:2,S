IIRC I tried to do that, but I think I ran into problems with
acpi_processor_idle which looks like it can call the cpu idle
routines with interrupts disabled. I definitely ran into problems
with something.
That should really be cleaned up though (whether we go one way
or the other doesn't matter as much as it being consistent),
I think.
But I wanted to try to keep this patch to a minimum.
