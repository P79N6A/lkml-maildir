Subject: Memory abuse with NFS Root filesystem?

Folks,
I have a Mac client that's running 2.4.19-pre10, XFree86 
(4.2.0) -query + Mozilla 1.0 and losing lots of size-2048 
buffers. The rate loss is approximately 1000 buffers/hour, 
no reaping of the cache is ever performed, and after 8 
hours or so, the system is unusable. I'm seeing this loss 
of memory after I boot with an initrd, get an IP address 
with dhclient and do a pivot_root onto the read-only NFS 
file system.
I can also boot the the client to a bash prompt on the
 local hard drive and then run XFree86 -query + Mozilla as
 before. Under these conditions, both with and without the
 local filesystem mounted RO, the size-2048 buffer
 utilization is nominal.
Local boot: slabinfo after 30 minutes:
size-2048      5   50  2048    3    25  1 
NFS Root: slabinfo after 15 & 60 minutes
size-2048   187 228  2048  94  114  1  (15 min)
size-2048   918 928  2048 460 464  1  (60 min)
Anyone ever seen or heard of this before? Any thoughts on
how to isolate this to a root cause?
Thanks,
Skip
