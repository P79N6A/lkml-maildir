I think the problem is the filenames need to not overwrite each other -
not actual synchronization in the kernel (which, as you point out, is
correct).
If we name the coredumps based on ->tgid, then all threads will dump to
the same file.  If we use ->pid, each thread will use its unique PID as
its filename.
