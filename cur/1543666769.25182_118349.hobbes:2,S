The best I've narrowed it down to is whatever makes 2.5.64-mm1 be
different from plain 2.5.64 and 2.5.64-mm2. In addition, I have one
more gripe, and this one is present in 2.4 too, but seems kernel
related:
When closing Gnome (Gnome 2.x, Gentoo), after the screen has been
"faded" by the logout applet, on the first keystroke or movement of
the mouse the machine will instantly cold start the machine.
mvh,
