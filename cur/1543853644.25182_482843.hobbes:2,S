A node was always defined that way. Search back a few years in the lkml
archives. We may be finding bugs in the implementation, but the
definition has not changed.
Supposing we hot-unplugged all the memory in a node? Or seems to have
happened in this instance is boot with mem=, cutting out memory on that
node.
