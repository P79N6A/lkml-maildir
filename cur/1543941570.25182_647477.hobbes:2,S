I don't have a Yukon FE, but I believe that the Yukon FE does have a ram
buffer, so you HANG_CHECK should be enabled for that device. You can check
by running:
	ethtool -d eth0 | grep 'Ram Buffer'
With ram buffer (like XL, EC)
	
# ethtool -d eth0 | grep 'Ram Buffer'
Ram Buffer                   0x18
No ram buffer (like EC-U, FE+, ...)
# ethtool -d eth0 | grep 'Ram Buffer'
Ram Buffer                   0x00
