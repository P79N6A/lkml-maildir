Until they attain interactive status.  Note that attaining this status
requires only one sleep, and once attained, it can be sustained.  I
don't know what the current exact numbers are, but until recently, the
numbers were that once sleep_avg became full, a non-niced task could
sustain ~95% cpu indefinitely.
You simply cannot ignore interactive tasks.  At the very least, you have
to disallow requeue if the resource limit has been exceeded, otherwise,
this patch set is non-functional.
