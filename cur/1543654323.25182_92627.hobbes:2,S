  kbuild: Additional config targets for testing
  This patch adds the following targets, which generate some configs
  useful for testing - which kind should be clear from the names:
  o allyesconfig
  o allmodconfig
  o allnoconfig
  o randconfig
  It also adds
  o defconfig
  which does the same as make oldconfig but uses the defaults for all
  new options without asking.
  The actual patch was done by Ghozlane Toumi, maintained in kbuild-2.5
  by Keith Owens, and extracted by Sam Ravnborg and patch@luckynet.dynu.com.
Don't you think accusing me of "stealing" from kbuild-2.5 is a bit 
harsh???
