if this is bad hardware why:
- didn't this show up earlier?
- did a several hour memtest run couple of weeks ago didn't show up anything?
- and does stuff like compiling all of kde 3.5.8 or the latest kde4 rc finish 
without any problems?
If it would be bad hardware, I should see segfaults left and right, right? but 
I don't see them.  In fact, apart from the oopses the system works fine - 
even with the oopses the system works fine, apart from the occasional stuck 
ps aux
And this messages:
[41160.823959] kio_http_cache_[25229] general protection rip:32621f1fe9 
rsp:7fff59a3d270 error:0
show up on closing konqueror tabs/Konqueror. There are no surprising exits, no 
apps vanishing. 
But I will run memtest86+ (or should I use memtest86?).
Glück Auf,
Volker
