  From the manufacturer.  We had the fullest possible co-operation
including all technical specs, several sample machines, source to
the WinCE drivers for the hardware, and engineers (including the lead
hardware designer, a *very* cluey gentleman) on standby to answer
questions.
  It makes an amazing difference to have all the nasty little
hardware quirks and known workarounds for them laid bare before you.
Greg.
