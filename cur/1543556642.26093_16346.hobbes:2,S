I've seen this behavior on test-6 and up. I think it has something to do with
a problem in shared memory which is used by the 'hdparm -tT' code snippet. I
believe it munges over a lot of the memory segments that contain cached disk
files (the common ones accessed, such as /etc/mtab and /etc/utmp..etc). When
looking at the contents of those files, the memory is obtained from the cache
and they appear bogus, but on disk they are still correct.
If this problem occurs, it's best to hit the reset button so that no 'bad' data
is written back to disk during a sync call.
Can anyone else verify that the problem is in shared memory and not the disk
caching layer?
Regards,
 Byron
