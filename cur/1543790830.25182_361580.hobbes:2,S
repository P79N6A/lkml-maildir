Hi!

I'm sorry, but I acked this one too quickly. I'd prefer to keep "relocate" code where
it is, and define "must not collide" as a part of interface. That will keep snapshot.c
smaller/simpler, and I plan to
eventually put responsibility for relocation to userspace.
That should simplify error handling at least: data structures
needed for relocation can be kept in userspace memory, and therefore
we do not risk memory leak in case something goes wrong.
