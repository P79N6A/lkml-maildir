The x86_64 bits would be very nice.  Linus' didn't like the idea to make
that a config option, commented "either it works or it doesn't", so I
left it out.  The code is small anyway, and the data tables can be
freed, so making it an option doesn't make much sense.  IMHO there are
way to many config options anyway ...
cheers,
