GCC does something similar during its own installation: first it builds a
bare-bones compiler with the local cc, then recompiles itself to produce a
GCC-built GCC - then repeats that step, and compiles the two results.
There are a couple of issues with some platforms adding timestamps etc
within the binary, IIRC, but it's basically just a simple file compare.
Of course, it's not sufficient to detect the recursive Trojan cc approach,
but it's a pretty good consistency/sanity check.
