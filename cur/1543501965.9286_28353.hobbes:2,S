When cfront was in the run, template,
for istance, simply didn't exists. And C++
was the half of what is know. I think you
have to update your C++ knowledge, too...

If you're asking for a rigourous definition,
it's much better asking to Stroustroup or

This example was just a paradox. As you
could see if you read the mail until the end,
just a paradox to intend that all the teorethical
approach to an OO OS are overrun by the
simple and efficient approach given from Linux.
This what I meant in my previous mail,
what I mean now, and what I'll always think ;-)
I have no plans to automagically produce
USB drivers from anywhere...

I agree.

OK.

This depend on the compiler. As
Stroustroup said, there are many
people thinking that they don't have
to use C++ because it produces
more complex and long assembly
code. But *he*'s C++ compiler (what is it,
we don't know) produces shorter code
than the C ones. It really depends on the
compiler. If you take g++ as your
milestone, this could be your
conclusion, but I can't take your
assumption for granted in any
case on any compiler. On Visual
C++ (which is a very good
compiler, unfortunately it produces
Windows programs), I could
examine the asm code and I
don't see all the bloating code
you say.
