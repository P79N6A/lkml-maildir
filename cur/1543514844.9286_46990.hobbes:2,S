I released a 2.2.13aa3 mainly to fix an interesting bigmem bug spotted and
fixed by Leonard N. Zubkoff. His fix is obviously right and strictly
necessary. Unfortunately such bug can trigger only on real bigmem hardware
and as I don't have access to a real bigmem hardware I couldn't reproduce
and debug it here. I'll take care to fix such bigmem bug in the
2.3.25pre2 kernel as well ASAP (I verifyed the bug is present into the 2.3
bigmem stuff as well).
Many thanks Leonard!! ;))
This bugfix release is interesting for you _only_ if one of the below
conditions is true:
o	you are using the bigmem code and you have more than 2gigabyte of
	RAM and you have CONFIG_2G set
o	you are using the bigmem code and you have more than 1gigabyte of
	RAM and you have CONFIG_1G set
o	you are taking advantage of the fdset patch to increase the fdset
	to more than 1024 files descriptors
The differences between 2.2.13aa2 and 2.2.13aa3 are:
z-bigmem-2.2.13aa3-7.gz		-> fixed a obvious silly bigmem
				   bug that will lead
				   to processes killed randomly.
				   (all the credit goes to Leonard N.
				   Zubkoff)
fdset-fix.gz			-> fixed a fdset bug that may lead to
				   memory corruption and Oopses
				   (credits goes to
				   Savochkin Andrey Vladimirovich,
				   I only backported the 2.3.x patch
				   to a four liner against 2.3.13)
dcache-hashfn.gz		-> use only the dentry noise for
				   randomizing the dcache hashfn
				   (all the credit goes to David S.
				   Miller)
To go in sync with 2.2.13aa3 you can:
	mkdir 2.2.13aa3
	cd 2.2.13aa3
	wget --retr-symlinks -A\*.gz 
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.13aa3/
\*
	cd ..
and now you'll have all the interesting patches in the directory
2.2.13aa3.
At this point rename the 2.2.13 sources to 2.2.13aa3:
	mv linux-2.2.13 linux-2.2.13aa3
	cd linux-2.2.13aa3
and apply all the 2.2.13aa3 patches that you previously downloaded from
the ftp site:
	apply-patches.sh ../2.2.13aa3
At this point your tree will be in sync with 2.2.13aa3. Just configure
recompile and boot the new kernel.
You can find the `apply-patches.sh` bash script I written to easily apply
my kernel patches here:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/tools/apply-patches/apply-patches.sh.gz
There is also a README on how to use it:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/tools/apply-patches/README.gz
The 2.2.13aa3 kernel is placed here:

.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.13aa3/
Have fun!
------ stuff present since 2.2.13aa2 --------
SMP-scheduler-2.2.11-E.gz	-> rewrote of reschedule_idle. (me)
buffer-hash.gz			-> fixes lowmem box hash size. (me)
buffer-races-2.2.10-A.gz	-> fixes of race condition that may lead
				   to bad things in invalidate_buffers()
				   and set_blocksize(). (me)
clear-backlog-2.gz		-> fixes for a SMP race condition in
				   the main network backlog handling. (me)
dcache-hash.gz			-> dcache hash dynamic (with my
				   own heuristc). (started from 2.2.13ac1 
                                   but then reimplemented by me)
free_page.gz			-> cleanup of the __free_pages
				   interface. (me)
hashed-buffers-2.2.10.gz	-> minor fix to increase the debugging
				   information in the right place. (me)
inode-leak-2.2.10-A.gz		-> make sure to not leak memory
				   by allocating lots of sockets (DoS),
				   and let know the admin to enlarge
				   the max-inodes if the admin really 
				   wants more unfreeable memory in the
				   icache. (me)
kupdate-sigstop-2.2.11-1.gz	-> allow kupdate to be stopped via
				   SIGSTOP (currently it must be stopped
				   by setting interval to zero via
				   sysctl). (me)
no-swapout-2.2.10-B.gz		-> avoid swapin/swapouts during heavy
				   I/O (strictly necessary for decent
				   performances on very I/O and MM loaded
				   servers). (me)
oom-2.2.12-I.gz			-> assorted OOM fixes (deadlocks in
				   pagein, Alpha SIGBUS fix, avoid
				   sigkilling iopl() application send
				   a sigterm instead, avoid init
				   to be killed), it's the same
				   patch merged by Alan into 2.2.14pre2. (me)
pagecache-hash.gz		-> pagecache hash dynamic (I think
				   it's DaveM's work, literally I took it
				   from 2.2.13ac1). I agree with the
				   heuristc used. It allocates
				   num_physpages buckets for the pagecache
				   and this basically means all the
				   buckets will be filled supposing a
				   perfect hash distribution with all the memory
				   allocated in the cache. (all credits
				   to David S. Miller)
probe-irq-2.3.14-pre2-1.gz	-> avoid a pending irq to be mistaken
				   for a spurious irq. (me)
shrink_all_cache-2.2.10-A.gz	-> make sure that big memory boxes will
				   shrink the cache well enough. (me)
trashing-mem-2.2.10-A.gz	-> heuristic to penalize memory hogs,
				   the system will remains responsive
				   also during heavy swapout. (me)
version.gz			-> set the EXTRAVERSION to aa2 ;)
wait-event-smp-races.gz		-> Put the two mb() after setting the
				   task state as blocking and before
				   checking if the event is just happend
				   (SMP race fix). (me)
wait4-smp-race.gz		-> _Critical_ SMP race fix.
				   Without this one liner each time you
				   run `ls` from bash, the bash is going
				   to deadlock in wait4 if you are unlucky
				   enough. The race is very small
				   but there are machine under heavy
				   fork load load that reproduced this
				   race regularly after some day of load.
				   The SMP race can happen only
				   with an SMP kernel on a SMP hardware. (me)
wakeup_bdflush-2.2.10-A.gz	-> avoid deadlocking in wakeup_bdflush
				   (the run_task_queue() can sleep for
				   example while running the loop
				   request function). (me)
z-bigmem-2.2.13aa2-6.gz		-> 4GB support on x86. (me and
				   Gerhard Wichert)
z-bigmem-nodebug.gz		-> turn the bigmem code into production
				   mode.
z-bigmem-rawio-2.2.13aa2-1.gz	-> rawio working even with bigmem memory
				   (I started with rawio from 2.2.13ac1
				   and SCT's 2.3.x rawio bounce buffers,
				   all the credits go to Stephen C.
				   Tweedie)
zmagic-all-blocksize.gz		-> allow zmagic binaries to run
				   also on 4k filesystems (it's the same
				   that gone into 2.2.14pre2). (me)
