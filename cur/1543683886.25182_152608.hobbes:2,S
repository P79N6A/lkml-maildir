That concept has been seen before in other operating systems, and I'm
pretty sure that although Con and Ingo are doing stellar work, they will
soon have to start feeding back I/O and paging patterns into the calculations...
In the meantime, I probably need to see what tweaking the various paging
controls does... /proc/sys/vm/swappiness looks like a good place to start. ;)
