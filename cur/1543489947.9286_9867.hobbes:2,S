Compile with magic SysRq key support and use Alt+SysRq+M to see if your
memory's getting fragmented. It spits out something like:
0*4kB 12*8kB 410*16kB 135*32kB 29*64kB 19*128kB = 15264kB)
Which tells you how many `lumps' of different sizes are available. I wonder
is there a better name than a `lump' for a block of pages? :) I assume that
get_free_pages will pull apart a large block into smaller ones if necessary,
otherwise I might be heading for problems looking at the example I just
quoted..
