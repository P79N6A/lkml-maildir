I've already been informed about this by someone else.  You probably have
Western Digital Enterprise drive(s) on that SCSI bus or other similar drives. 
Disabling target initiated Sync/Wide negotiation makes the errors all but

initiated Sync/Wide negotiation so I can get this taken care of for 5.1.20.
