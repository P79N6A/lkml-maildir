Hmm, perhaps it is wrong thing to tell the devices what state to enter
in the first place.

It did not look overly ugly to me... so it is probably okay. Not sure
what the next step is -- you'll probably want some sysfs interface for
suspending single devices?

I'm not sure we want to move to anything complicated than simple enum.
