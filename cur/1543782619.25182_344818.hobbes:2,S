Hi Christoph,
   I sent another followup to this thread with a patch containing a
fairly crude algorithm that I think better explains my starting point.
I'm sure the weighting and scaling factors need work, but I think many
of the criteria you describe will favor the right clock.

I'm hoping the jitter/cpu and latency calculation will always end up
favoring the cycle counter in the scenario.

If we're setting the jitter flag appropriately, which I think we are,
then the low latency of the ITC and lack of jitter penalty should do the
right thing here.

Scaling the latency to the average across a NUMA system will
automatically order these correctly.  They will definitely have higher
latency than the ITC, so should fall about here on the list.  It's easy
to make the Altix RTC have no node association and therefore not
penalize the access latency further.

   Yes, I don't know how to handle low power situations other than have
a flag on the interpolators and a hook to switch to the best low power
timer when the need arises.  We may need to use the same hook to
re-evaluate the timer when a CPU hotplug occurs.  This way we could
dynamically fall back to case 1 above if most of the CPUs are removed
(and likewise move to an hpet if CPUs are added).
   I was looking into the suggestion to use logarithms to try to
normalize some of the factors such that weighting is more logical.
Hopefully that won't explode the complexity.  Thanks,
	Alex
