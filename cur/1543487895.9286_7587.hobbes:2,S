The first patch by Alexander with the modification of replacing all 
instances of max_files with max_files*2 appears to be working great.  I   
will keep everyone informed to see if this really works w/o problems.     
Alexander's second patch (what you cleaned up) lasted for about 2 hours on
my system until the system crashed and any new command issued segfaulted.
