The soundcard I use the Genius Sound Maker 3DX ISA PNP card (which
utilises the
YMF 719E-S chip) no longer works after 2.1.132.
I switched on the DDB macro in ad1848.c (2.2.0pre4) to find that the
card fails three
tests in the ad1848 probe called by the opl3sa2 module (selectively
disabling each
one) ie.
   ad1848_detect() - step A
   ad1848_detect() - step B
   ad1848_detect() - step C
[Also the opl3sa2 module now complains:
  No Yamaha audio controller found
  opl3sa2.c: chipset version = 7
It never used to and that's a little strange since none of the pre2.2.0
patches have
touched the opl3sa2.c source file - I expect its some type of side
effect]
After extensive searching for info on the YMF719 chipset I couldn't find
any
technical info that would help resolve the problem.
I would be happy to carry out any tests/instrument the code for any
interested
parties.
Does anyone have the technical spec for the YMF-719E-S ? If so, perhaps
I can
try and fix it.
I'm not on the list, so please CC any replies.
Regards,
   Mike.
