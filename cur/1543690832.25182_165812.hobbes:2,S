If you know that you're only booting on a 486, why include all the junk
needed solely for later processors?

Echo my first comment.  I think it's fair to make this stuff
fine-grained -- as long as present behavior is preserved.  So IMO
fine-grained "I really want this cpu, and this cpu only" stuff really
requires a dependency on CONFIG_EMBEDDED.  When !CONFIG_EMBEDDED, for
example, it would define CONFIG_CPU_686 to ensure the required 686
pieces were in place.
I like the general direction of Adrian's patch, and think that moving in
this direction will provide a lot of hidden maintenance _benefits_ after
the initial pain...  But.  Adrian's patch is a tough thing to get right,
and IMO requires a lot of testing.

The arch/i386/kernel/cpu stuff is so modular, code like the above just
screams for an ->init_mtrr() hook in there.  drivers/char/hw_random.c
(portably) depends on VIA RNG's xstore instruction, which implies a
dependency on code and settings in arch/i386/*.  So, there's nothing
fundamentally wrong with sticking your fingers in there, IMO...
