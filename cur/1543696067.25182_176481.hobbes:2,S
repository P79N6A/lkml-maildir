In some of the earlier testX versions of the kernel, I did not see any 
difference between compiling as a module, and compiling into the kernel. (It 
is currently a module on my system.)
I did, however, manage to keep ntpd happy by reducing HZ to 100. Even raising 
HZ to 200 is enough to throw off its PLL. The machine is idle for 90% of the 
day, though, so I don't know if the PLL is adapting to the fact that the 
system is idling, but the values for tick look reasonable.

Pasi's patch against test9 seems to work fine in this regard. I am running 
with i2c_amd756 and amd_k7_agp now, and neither one has trouble loading 
anymore (after a cold boot, anyway).

After a warm reboot on my S2460 motherboard, it seems as though the module 
occasionally needs to receive an interrupt from somewhere ACPI-related. Most 
of the time, this means that I have to press either the soft power button or 
the sleep button to get the system to continue booting (!).
I am using the default #defines (i.e. no C3, POS or NTH enabled).
Info on the northbridge:
$ lspci -vn -s 0:0
00:00.0 Class 0600: 1022:700c (rev 11)
...
and the southbridge:
$ lspci -vn -s 7:3
00:07.3 Class 0680: 1022:7413 (rev 01)
...
I looked through the chipset documentation again (specifically checking the 
errata for these revisions), and nothing jumped out at me. I won't be able to 
look at this in depth for another month or two, though.
