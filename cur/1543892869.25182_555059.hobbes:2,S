I was on vacation in april, and it took almost the
entire may to process the backlog ...

well, there are two ways not to account sharing:
 1) account it to the first user
 2) account it to every user
while the first one typically causes quite an
imbalance when applied to shared resources (as
Linux-VServer uses them), the latter one creates
a new, but fair, metric for the usage
to make that clear: we definitely prefer the
latter one over the former, because we do not
want to bring that imbalance to our shared guests
(besides that, the second one doesn't add any
overhead compared to the first one, more than that
it probably simplifies the entire design)

yeah, I have some kind of déjà vu here too ...

well, from the system PoV, a constantly swapping
guest (on an otherwise unused host) is definitely
something you do not really want, not to talk
about a tightly packed host system, where guests
start hogging the I/O with _unnecessary_ swapping

okay, to clarify, we (Linux-VServer) do not want
that behavior ...

well, I would rip out the entire accounting and
add a summation accounting as we do it right now,
no problem with keeping the reclaim mechanisms
though ... but I doubt that this is what you have
in mind?

just to make it clear, I don't want any limits
in mainline which penalize the first started
guest in a shared guest scenario .. or to rephrase,
such a limit would be useless for our purpose
