Heheh...
I'm not quite sure why you would want to do this with ram and hdd
prices today, on a normal system you should plan on having 2x more swap
then you will ever need so if you are actually getting close to running
out then you have bigger problems.
But,
You need to make a daemon which calls the approiate systems calls to
determin free swap and automaticly makes on disk swapfiles in 5-50meg
chuncks.. It should do everything by itself (no calling external programs)
and it should be mlocked and small..
Here's what needs to be done, 
mlock code 
check free swap
if free_swap< 25% and n_swaps<max_swaps {
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/swap.n bs=1024 count=32768
mkswap /path/swap.n
swapon /path/swap.n
n_swaps++
}
sleep 1;
