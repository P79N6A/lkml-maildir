I am writing a partitionable block device driver for the 2.4 kernel.
Once the driver is loaded and the device mounted, reading, writing,
and ioctls work properly.
The driver becomes unstable after many mounts/unmounts, and I have
come to suspect that I am not calling fsync_dev() correctly.
I do call fsync_dev() on release as well as on remove.
Is this incorrect?  Can it lead to instability?  I've counted four
different ways in which the driver dies, including a call to 
BUG() in buffer.c...
Thank you,
Christine
