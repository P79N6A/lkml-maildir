   Given that we don't have a 64-bit atomic_t type, what do people
   think of Davej's patch?  (attached, below)
Broken, in 9 out of 10 places where he adds page_table_lock
acquisitions, this lock is already held --> instant deadlock.
This report is complicated by the fact that people were forgetting
that vmlist_*_{lock,unlock}(mm) was actually just spin_{lock,unlock}
on mm->page_table_lock.  I fixed that already by removing the dumb
vmlist locking macros which were causing all of this confusion.
Later,
