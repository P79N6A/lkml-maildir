Hmm, "we want" is a bit ambiguously word.
We have three reviewing viewpoint.
1) this code is consistent to other linux kernel code.
this patch fill its requrement perfectly.
2) the behavior is enough surpriseless?
Honestly, I think this patch is a bit supriseful.
example,
  1. process-A fork process-B
  2. process-A wait by wait4()
  3. process-B consume 1GB memory
  4. process-B exec another program
  5. process-B consume 100KB memory
  6. process-B exit
  7. process-A get maxrss=100KB
oh, 1GB consumption is disappeared.
However, if we choice process don't forget maxrss at exec,
another supriseful happend.
example,
  1. process-A consume 1GB memroy
  2. process-A fork process-B
  3. process-A wait by wait4()
  4. right after, process-B exec another program
  5. process-B consume 100KB memory
  6. process-B exit
  7. process-A get maxrss=1GB
oh, this design cause large process can't get child maxrss.
So either choice have both merits and demerits.
Then, I suggest to take prior other os compatibility than own thinking
good behavior.
3) if the feature is other os compatibility feature, the bahavior is
   the same other?
I think most important thing.
Some scripting language (e.g. perl, PHP) already can use getrusage()
return value. (but linux maxrss is always 0)
Any scripter don't like incompatibility behavior.
I don't know other os maxrss inheriting rule.
May I ask you investiate maxrss inheriting of exec of which os behavior?

hm, performance is obiously important.
if you get much performance improvement, I'll withdraw my claim.

Ah, I forgot RUSAGE_THREAD. thanks.
However I still think current code have unnecessary assumption.
if who==RUSAGE_BOTH,
correct behavior: max(hiwater_rss, mm_rss) + signal->cmaxrss)
this code:        max(signal->maxrss + signal->cmaxrss, max(hiwater_rss, mm_rss))
  1. if mm_rss == hiwater_rss, above two code is equivalent.
  2. if signal->maxrss == 0, above two code is equivalent too.
So all current caller keep this two assumption. but I think it is 
unnecessary assumption. imho we can write generic correct code.
