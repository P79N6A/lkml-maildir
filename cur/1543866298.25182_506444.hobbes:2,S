Linus and Oleg tried to fix it with various subsequent changes
to scripts/Kbuild.include, but it's still broken.
For some reason $(call ...) invocations add spaces.  I tried
another test case:
define test
 $(shell echo -n)
endef
VAR:=$(call test)
all:
	@echo "\'$(VAR)\'"
And this always prints:
' TEST'
even with GNU Make version 3.81
If I put a $(strip ...) around the define, the space is
still there.  If I put the $(strip ...) around VAR's
$(call), the space goes away.
