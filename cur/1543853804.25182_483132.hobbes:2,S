Subject: changing internal kernel system mechanism in runtime by a module patch

is it possible to replace linux kernel internal functions such as
schdule () to lets say my_schdule ()  in a run time with a module
patch???
(so that every call in the kernel to schdule() will go to my_schdule()... ) ???
i am talking about a clean/standard way to do such thing
(without overwrite the mem address of the function and replace it in a
dirty way...)
