I didn't mean it that way. I though it was interesting in light of the
earlier flame war. Esp considering they appear to be using virtual
functions.
The 'you people are nuts. :)' was meant as a positive statement. 
Don't you know? All breakthroughs come from crazy people. :)

Their code speaks for itself. It outperforms the Linux code and is more
flexible. 
Although, I tend to see that as a case for additional optimization of the
current Linux code... C++ can be a very useful development tool with the
potential to increase modularity and simplify development. However,
run-time abstraction will always be a performance loss.
I was happy to see the prior flame war end with 'Let the code speak', I only
brought this up here to draw some attention to Click from a C++ in the kernel
prospective, i.e. They are using C++ in the kernel (without extensive kernel
