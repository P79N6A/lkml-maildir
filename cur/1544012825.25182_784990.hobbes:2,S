Why would we want or need to?

Hmm.
I have taken a quick skim and I am not seeming the part of the code you are
talking about.  Is the problem code in mainline?
I'm guessing it has something to do with reserve_top_address() being called
with a bad value in the normal case.  But I don't see it being called
at all in the normal case.
