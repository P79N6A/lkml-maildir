My understanding from the previous discussion was that it actually
is a multi-page power of two allocation, so the right choice might
be __get_free_pages() instead of kmalloc, but it probably doesn't
make much of a difference.
You should really do some measurements to see what the minimal
queue sizes are that can get you optimal throughput.
