I'm pretty sure you did, since it's perfectly legal (and occasionally
useful, if gruesome) to do
#define THE_STRUCT struct1
#include "struct_def.h"
#undef THE_STRUCT
#define THE_STRUCT struct2
#include "struct_def.h"
and have both #includes work.  You may be thinking of #import, which
is deprecated except for objective-c, IIRC.
In answer to Linus' question...yes, in a large system redundent
include guards can make a real difference, particularly for headers
which get included by other headers regularly.  OTOH, my last
experience using them was on an underpowered Solaris box, which (a)
didn't have enough memory for all the developers compiling on it and
(b) was running an old Solaris, so its read caching was pretty lame
anyway.  It makes rather a lot of difference if the preprocessor has
to read <linux/posix_types.h> from the disk 20 times or if it can get
it from the file cache 20 times.
