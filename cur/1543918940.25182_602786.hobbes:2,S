Ignore this part - the problem is confined to the HDA-Intel driver.
I've verified the eth0 was a red herring - what would happen is if I booted
it while undocked, the startup scripts would try to ifconfig it up, find no
link on the device, and then ifconfig it down, at which point /proc/interrupts
would show it as 'none-edge' because at one time there *had* been interrupts
on it when it was 'PCI-MSI-edge', but it was then turned off again.
