The fix is fine and so is the BUG() check.
Usually, you're supposed to make sure that the very last thing
you do is register_netdev(), and that all possible errors are
possible only before that call.
And that's what BOND basically does, except that it must register
multiple devices in a loop and therefore cannot follow that rule
precisely.
So I've added the patch to my tree, it's fine to do this for a
special case usage like this one.
