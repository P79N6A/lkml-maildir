Hi,
I see that on 2.6.18-ck1 still some sort of quirks patch is needed for 
VIA chips.
I get plenty:
ALSA: underrun, at least 0ms.
and with 2.6.17-ck1 with the quirks.c.patch I did not. But the patch 
does not fit on 2.6.18 :-(
Strangely enough this time around I do *not* get underruns on vt's with 
mpg321 and I *do* get them on X. Last time around it was the reverse.
Is there a fix for 2.6.18 ?
Thanks!
Hugo
