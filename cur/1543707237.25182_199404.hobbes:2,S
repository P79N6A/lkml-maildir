In most environments you do know, because you have a legacy encoding and a new 
UTF-8 encoding. There is no medicine that solves all compatibility problems, but the worst
symptoms can be alleviated while getting medicine to fix the disease.

User's are clueless and you know that :-) They see garbage and blame the 
administrator or creator of the apps or whomever comes in handy.

When I see I languages I don't understand, I understand that that's it. It doesn't
mean it actual IS garbage. The problem is when I see garbage simply because
the OS thinks it's unimporant.

Again users want characters, not bytes. Here up in the north we are among the
lucky ones that can still read a partially unlegible file name, because enough many
characters are usually just ascii. If a name was encoded in SJIS and you see them
interpreted as UTF-8 you'll a a string of pure garbage and you need to ask a bit
twiddler for help in decoding it simply becase ASCII characters are not likely to be
among the characters.
Note that I assume that the cases where there is a temporary working fix is the
two-locale (legacy+new) situation. And the only reason for the fix is to support 
migration from "old" charset to new charset without requiring martial arts.
For those application where it doesn't matter the point is moot. For most
users everything they see matters and the application cannot know what encoding
is used because there often is no relation between the application that creates and
the one that uses a file, and hence its name. The only place that can reliably store
the encoding of a filename is the file system, either as metdata, standard encoding on
disk or as a convention. It could be =?iso-8859-1?Q?=E5rsfest?=.rtf, fine with me. Not
adding a convention is that application can just work. A convention needs agreeing
upon between all apps. The kernel can just make it work.

That's why there are locales, unfortunately these are volatile parameters that get lost. And it
doesn't have to be a a particular character encoding. It can be something per file system although
a fixed standard has the advantage that the filename can be read by anyone.

I thought the kernel was there to support user space. Ok, I know its' Just For Fun, but still
some usability is nice. Wh

There's no need for multiple charsets when one can do all. So they added a
compromise that a charset could be specified to simplify creation of XML files
for legacy eight bit apps. I don't thing you understand XML at all. Enforcing
Unicode is helluvalot better than the "enforce" ASCII attitude of the past.

No matter what I think of unicode, I simply cannot have it yet everywhere.
