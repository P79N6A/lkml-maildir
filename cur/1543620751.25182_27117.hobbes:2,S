What do you mean exactly?  bttv's memory management code, which has
been copied to various places, and which is now broken in 2.5.x due
to virt_to_bus() being gone finally?
Some of this is work-in-progress.  I'm talking to Dave to put some
helper functions to handle DMA to vmalloced memory blocks to some
sensible place within the kernel.  If someone wants to have a look
(not final yet):
