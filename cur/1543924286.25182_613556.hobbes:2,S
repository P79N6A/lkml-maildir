Commit 9ead190b ("IB/uverbs: Don't serialize with ib_uverbs_idr_mutex")
rewrote how userspace objects are looked up in the uverbs module's
idrs, and introduced a severe bug in the process: there is no checking
that an operation is being performed by the right process any more.
Fix this by adding the missing check of uobj->context in __idr_get_uobj().
Apparently everyone is being very careful to only touch their own
objects, because this bug was introduced in June 2006 in 2.6.18, and
has gone undetected until now.
