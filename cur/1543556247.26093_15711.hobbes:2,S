This is wrong. Linus please do not apply this patch, or if you have done back
it out. Not only does it do format conversions in kernel (which is a strict
not to be done in the sound driver policy) it also makes it impossible to make
mmap work correctly with the OSS API definitions.
Tjeerd. I deliberately applied only small bits of your patch before because
the mono mode stuff clutters the driver horribly and is not in the right place.
It belongs in the application/libraries
