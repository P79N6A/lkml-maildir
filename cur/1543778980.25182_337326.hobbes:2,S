Yes! Intel has more than 'load' and 'store' instructions. If
memory is in the cache, the following memory operations are
shown fastest to slowest...
 	movl	(%ebx), %eax		# Index-register indirect. Note that
 					# ebx needs to be loaded so the overall
 					# access might be slower. Also some
 					# index registers are faster on
 					# some CPUs (486-> eax is fastest)
 	movl	(mem), %eax		# Direct from memory into register
 	movl	0x04(%ebx), %eax	# Index-register plus displacment
 	movl	(%esi, %ebx), %eax	# Two register indirect
 	movl	0x04(%esi, %ebx), %eax	# Two register plus displacement
When using 'movl (men), %eax', "mem" is a 32-bit word that is fetched
from the instruction stream while 'movl (%ebx), %eax' is only 2 bytes.
Therefore, if an index register can remain loaded with the correct offset
or manipulated with 'lea', then single-register indirect memory
access is fastest on current ix86 processors.
