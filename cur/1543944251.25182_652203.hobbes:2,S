Hi David:  to clarify:  I added the "interesting" because I didn't want
the "look good" to be interpreted as an informed judgement.  I hadn't
time to review in detail.  I do have some comments, which I'll send in
response to the original patch messages [or any later posting thereof,
should that occur before I have time].

Hmmm, so 'static' means "don't contexutalize"--i.e., don't mask off
disallowed or memoryless nodes?  That means we'll need to skip them in
the interleave node calculation in the allocation path.  Perhaps your
patch already addresses this, but I haven't had time to look.  
Later,
