Hi Marc,
That sounds like my first version (unposted), which failed IMO.
It looks OK if you/user does not enable viewing all flags/options
(in [xg]config -- I used xconfig).  However, if those options are
enabled, you/user sees all config options for all architectures,
and I didn't find that acceptable.  Feel free to disagree with me
and persuade me otherwise, because having them *all* in
lib/Kconfig.debug is nicer IMO.
The full patch to do this (against 2.6.5-bk2) is now available at:
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/patches/kconfig_debug_265bk2.patch
if you or anyone else wants to compare how they look.
Thanks,
