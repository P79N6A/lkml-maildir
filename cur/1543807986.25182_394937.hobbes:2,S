You seem to be the only person around who gets on well with him. Please,
more people step up and tell me I'm wrong. I am only going off the mailing
list afterall, and not daily personal interaction of some other kind.

By definition, if they don't maintain code, their not a maintainer. If they
only tell someone that they're going to do something stupid, they're a
code reviewer.

Other people have given feedback in the past that has been along the lines
of suggesting improvements / cleanups / whatever, but (feel free to correct
me) no one apart from him has written it off wholesale, told me I'm wasting
my time or the like.
I want to get on with Pavel, I really do. But it's very hard when, despite my
best efforts, trying to make allowances for possible misunderstandings and
the like, I never seem to hear a helpful word from him. It's always "No.".
"I don't want that.", and never (so far as I recall) "Here's how you could do
that better..", "The idea is ok but the implementation is broken because..." or
the like. Perhaps it is (as was said yesterday) just a cultural/language thing,
but I'm not sure.

I haven't seen any replies apart from yours so far. Perhaps there's something
wrong with my mail delivery :(. I'll check the archives.
