There seems to be rather a lot of damage here.
I assume that the sysctl changes are what caused the netfilter oopses.
- nf_conntrack_init() calls nf_conntrack_expect_init() which fails due to
  sysctl problems.  
- nf_conntrack_init() bales out without calling nf_conntrack_helper_init()
  So nf_ct_helper_hsize never gets initialised.
- Later, netfilter client code calls helper_hash(), which gets a
  divide-by-zero due to nf_ct_helper_hsize==0.
yeah, that's a netfilter bug, but we're trying to get kernels tested here. 
If I'm feeling energetic I'll drop the sysctl changes and do rc2-mm3. 
Probably I won't feel energetic, but we'll need a lot of fixes here before
I can release the sysctl changes in another -mm, please.
