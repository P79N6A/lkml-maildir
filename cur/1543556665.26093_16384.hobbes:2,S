> The native YMF PCI driver from Linux-2.4.0-test12-pre5 works on my card:
I did not have a chance to look at whatever is in 2.4, but from
reading Linus's e-mails I understand that Jaroslav made a new
port, which is probably unrelated to the stuff that I hastily
cooked up for 2.2 (I really wanted to play Doom on my new Sony).
I am sorry for the lack of communication.
I'll see what 2.2 does about 1) playing at 5512 Hz, 2) compiling
as modules together (non-modules are made to be exclusive),
3) compiling if CONFIG_PCI is not enabled, 4) has Configure.help
update.
I am not sure what to do about CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.
My current plan is to discard "(EXPERIMENTAL)" and forget
about it until the next case.
Ioctl 0x5401 is a mystery. I do not know what it is
(looks like SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE without uppper bits).
Please send fewer attachements to the lists. Your sound fragment
is very useful, but I'd prefer to have it sent separately to me
upon a request (in uuencode :).
BTW, Legacy driver (ymf_sb) uses PC/DMA or whatever the name is,
which requires the north bridge support and, sometimes, additional
connections on the motherboard. This is not reflected in _any_
kernel documentation. I have spent numerous hours trying to make
it work on my laptop until I understood that even though my
chipset supports PC/DMA, necessary connections are missing.
At first glance, it looked as if IRQ does not come.
