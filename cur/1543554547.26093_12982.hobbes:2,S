In general it is impossible to assign all block read/writes to
particular tasks because many tasks may use the same block.  Maybe you
want to track block requests instead?  These happen in the task context,
but the paths are scattered.  Metadata is generally read using
ll_rw_block but written using mark_buffer_dirty (and the actual write
will be initiated by kflush or kupdate later).  Sometimes ll_rw_block is
used for writing, usually for synchronous operations.  The paths for
page cache data - most of your data - are even more scattered.  To track
then down, look for _find_page and variants.
Reads are associated pretty closely in time with the requesting process
but writes are not, so charging the transfers to the most recent
userspace task might be ok for reads - it doesn't work very well at all
for writes.
It doesn't sound very promising, does it?  You might consider tracking
block transfers by inode (easy for data, harder for metadata) and moving
the counts into per-task totals on file close.
