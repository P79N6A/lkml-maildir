Hi Andrew,
We discussed this in madvise(REMOVE) thread - to add support 
for sys_punchhole(fd, offset, len) to complete the functionality
(in the future).
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=113036713810002&w=2
What I am wondering is, should I invest time now to do it ?
Or wait till need arises ? 
My thought line is, I would add a generic_zeroblocks_range() 
function which would zero out the given range of pages and 
flush to disk.  Use this as a default operation, if the 
filesystems doesn't provide a specific function to free up
the blocks. Would this work ?
Suggestions ?
Thanks,
Badari
