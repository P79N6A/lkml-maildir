I agree with Rik and Christoph (I agreed with all of Christoph's points,
but most can be left until later on): mm/rmap.c and include/linux/rmap.h
(the latter a name change from include/linux/rmap-locking.h).
objrmap is the particular implementation found within that file in your
tree, but Rik imagined right from the start that there would be various
implementations:
 * This is kept modular because we may want to experiment
 * with object-based reverse mapping schemes.
(Aaargh, now we can expect someone to propose
CONFIG_PTE_CHAIN_RMAP, CONFIG_ANON_VMA_RMAP, CONFIG_ANONMM_RMAP etc)
