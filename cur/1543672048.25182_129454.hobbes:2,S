Could you explain to me the need to allocate memory in the low 256MB.
Generally the design is that you can allocate the memory anywhere
and then relocate_kernel.S will move where it needs to be kept.
I have had people wanting to use 300MB initial ramdisks and the like.  
If you have 500GB of memory what is the point of keeping anything on a disk?
When you have 4TB on a cluster or a NUMA machine I can understand
wanting to keep things local to a node.  But in those cases you want
to have local node zones so the problem does not come up.
In general I hate restricting the memory you can use, because kexec is
not just about booting linux.  But it is about booting anything that
we reasonably can.  The only case I have seen so far that makes sense
is when your physical memory is larger than your virtual memory.

I suspect so.  And I can't imagine it would be that hard to implement.
But I think I would like to see why you need that.
