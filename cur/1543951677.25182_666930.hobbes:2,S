A full kernel log is available at

I did the following:
- suspended the computer
- switched off the LCD
- resumed the computer
- tried to use hidmon, got the error
- unplugged the LCD
- plugged in the LCD
- tried to use hidmon again, got the error again
- suspended the computer
- resumed the computer
- tried to use hidmon again, and it worked
Note that I didn't switch off the LCD during the second suspend, in the
case that matters.
