Kernel 2.6.18 claims to provide PATA support for sata_promise according 
to the changelog. However, 2.6.18 does not properly load the IDE disks 
that are attached to an onboard raid-controller Promise PDC200378 (aka 
Fastrak 378 or Fastrak S150 TX4) which resides on an MSI 865PE-NEO FISR2 
motherboard as a "south bridge" for a maximum of two IDE disks and two 
SATA disks. I configured the BIOS for two IDE disks and RAID1 or as SATA 
and no change. The errors from sata_promise seen in the dmesg file as 
error messages (attached):
    ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xF8802200 ctl 0xF8802238 bmdma 0x0 irq 11
    ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xF8802280 ctl 0xF88022B8 bmdma 0x0 irq 11
    scsi2 : sata_promise
    ata1: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300)
    scsi3 : sata_promise
    ata2: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300)
