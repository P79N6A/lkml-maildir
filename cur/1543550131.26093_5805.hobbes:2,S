Hey now.  I didn't assume "Linux is RedHat".  I assumed a user who says
"Linux 6.2" is referring to "Red Hat Linux 6.2".  And I still wouldn't
bet against Igmar.  What's the point?  I don't like beer anyway. (:
Note that I deliberately ignored my assumption when replying -- I gave
instructions for Debian derivations, even though I don't know of any
Debian-derived distribution with a version number 6.2.
