fs/locks.c is one hell of a sick puppy. Nothing new about that. I'm kinda
curious about "n-squared" searches in other places, though - mind showing
them?
BTW, what spinlocks get contention in variant without BKL? And what about
comparison between the BKL and non-BKL versions? If it's something like
	BKL	no BKL
4-way	50	20
8-way	30	30
- something is certainly wrong, but restoring the BKL is _not_ a win.
I didn't look into recent changes in fs/locks.c, but I have quite problem
inventing a scenario when _adding_ BKL (without reverting other changes)
might give an absolute improvement. Well, I see a couple of really perverted
scenarios, but... Seriously, folks, could you compare the 4 variants above
and gather the contention data for the -test9 on your loads? That would help
a lot.
