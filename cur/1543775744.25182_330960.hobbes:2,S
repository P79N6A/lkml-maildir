Subject: Kernel panic when booting without acpi=off as of 2.6.12-rc1 and above

Summary of error:
insmod error inserting '/lib/ata_piix.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module
ERROR: /bin/insmod exited abnormally!
Mounting root filesystem
mount: error 19 mounting ext3
mount: error 2 mounting none
Switching to new root
switchroot: mount failed: 22
umount /initrd/dev failed: 2
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
I'm not able to figure out what is causing this panic. I'm running 
Fedora Core 3 on a Dell Optiplex GX280 with 2 sata disks in Raid0.
All Fedora kernels and vanilla up to 2.6.11 is working fine without 
using acpi=off. 2.6.12-rc1 and up to 2.6.13-rc1-mm1 won't boot unless I 
use acpi=off. I haven't been able to do much troubleshooting yet so I 
may be overlooking something trivial. Any kind of help appreciated.
