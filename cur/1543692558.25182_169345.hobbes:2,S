So it's OK for modversions to make modules depend upon the main kernel
image, but it's not OK for ipv6 to do the same exact thing.  Is this
what you're saying?

I don't see how you can say that modversions can create this module
dependency upon the kernel image, but ipv6 is not allowed to.
And this doesn't turn 'make modules' into the same thing as 'make all'.
It will still behave differently in a lot of situations.
