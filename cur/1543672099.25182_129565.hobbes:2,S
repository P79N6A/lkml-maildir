Hi list,
Sitting here watching the compile output from 2.4.21-rc1-ac4 and
noticing there is a _lot_ of warnings about comparisions between signed
and unsigned values. The question I have is the following. If all the
signed values were modified to unsigned to fix the warnings, how likely
are things to break? Is there any reason to use signed values unless a
specific reason when negative values are required?
