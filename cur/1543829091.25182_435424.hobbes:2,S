Yes it is.  And will work if we are okay to swap to kernel gs in
vsyscall code.

I was thinking of storing it is base address part of the descriptor and
then using the memory load to read it in vsyscall.  (Keeping the p bit
to zero in the descriptor).

cpu and node number are really important (for the reasons that you
mentioned in your initial mail on vgetcpu).  In addition to that I was
thinking in terms of having some counters like nmi_count that is already
there and per cpu specific.
Besides, not having to use the tcache part in the proposed system call
seems to just make the interface cleaner.
