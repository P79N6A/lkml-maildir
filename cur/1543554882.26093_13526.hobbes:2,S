Subject: test11pre6: incorrect makefile change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This toplevel Makefile change in 11pre6 is wrong:
-	$(HOSTCC) $(HOSTCFLAGS) -o scripts/split-include scripts/split-include.c
+	$(HOSTCC) $(HOSTCFLAGS) -I$(HPATH) -o scripts/split-include scripts/split-include.c
Many people have proposed this patch over the last few years, to kludge
around having a broken setup.  Basically, split-include.c is a regular
userspace program so if you can't compile it (without the -I), you
won't be able to compile the rest of userspace either.
Either you need the proper kernel directory symlinks in /usr/include/*,
or you need to make a copy of them like Debian does.
Linus, please revert.  Not only is it conceptually wrong, it will do
interesting things if you happen to be cross-compiling for another
architecture.
