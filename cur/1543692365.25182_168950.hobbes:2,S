An Origin 3k, Altix is essentially the Origin 3k architecture but
engineered around Itanic CPU boards. :)

Working to? Nah, they did that a long time ago:
http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-mm/2001-03/msg00004.html
They've had another 2.5 years since to further work on Linux 
scaleability.
"SGI Altix 3000 superclusters scale up to hundreds of processors."
So, either they've already run Linux on Altix or Origin internally
with hundreds of CPUs or they're fairly confident there arent any
major problems they couldnt sort out in the time it would take to
build, test and deliver a hundred+ node Altix.
