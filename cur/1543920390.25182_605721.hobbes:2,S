I'm pretty certain Intels' arechitecture is only has a 64bit front side bus.
Of course I'm used to seeing it clocked a bit higher.

Well it will be interesting to see what happens with NAND flash.  So far
it is pricey but you can easily make it faster then todays hard drives.
Capacity is still coming.

An interesting point.  What would really impress me is actually finding
a current work load that can productively swap after everything kernel
side is fixed up and optimized.   So far it seems like real swapping is so
painful that everyone is simply avoiding it.
