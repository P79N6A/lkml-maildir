Thanks for the pointer...this clued me in to look in other places. The BIOS
on these hosts was broken and luckily there was a later version which fixed
the problem.
For anyone else with the Tyan Thunder K7X (Model S2468): I flashed the
V4.03b BIOS
From Tyan:
09/30/02 2468403b.exe   TYAN  Thunder K7X (S2468)  V4.03b     Corrects error
message when running non-MP CPU
08/16/02 2468v403.exe   TYAN  Thunder K7X (S2468)  V4.03      Add USB boot,
48bit drive size support. ***Fix PCI IRQ routing***, MP table problem. Add
new processor support,  Add new flash part support, work round for ATI
Radeon 7500/78500 card, and work around for NVIDIA chipset Non-PCI
compliance AGP cards.
