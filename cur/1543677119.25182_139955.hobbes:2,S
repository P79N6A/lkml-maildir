I still need a real fix for d_move(). In addition, I'm getting worried
about the changes in functionality that you've introduced here. It
seems to me that your lockless scheme opens for a *lot* of races:
Look at all those functions that take dcache_lock, and then test
dentry->d_count. Unless I'm missing something here, your d_lookup()
clearly has them all screwed, no?
Cheers,
