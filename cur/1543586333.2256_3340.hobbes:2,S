Can you please try adding
	Option	"NoPM"
to the device section of XF86Config or (XF86Config) and then try suspending
and resuming.
This made suspend/resume much more reliable on the Thinkpad 600E with
XFree86 4.  Also you could try XFree86 4.0.2, as I know that it actually
does interact with APM (4.0.1 may have as well - I am not sure).
