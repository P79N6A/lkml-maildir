The VFS doesn't need to support delalloc as delalloc is fundamentally a
filesystem property. The VFS it already provides a hook for delalloc space
reservation that can return ENOSPC - it's called ->prepare_write().
Sure, a batch interface would be nice, but that's an optimisation that
needs to be done regardless of whether the filesystem supports delalloc or
not.  The current ->prepare_write() interface shows its limits when having to
do hundreds of thousands (millions, even) of ->prepare_write() calls per
second. This makes for entertaining scaling problems that batching would
make less of a problem.

Can be done right now - XFS does this probe-and-pull operation already for
writes. See xfs_probe_cluster(), xfs_cluster_write() and friends.
Yes, it would be nice to have the VM pass us clusters of adjacent pages, but
given that the file layout drives the cluster size it is more appropriate
to do this from the filesystem. Also, the pages do not contain the state
necessary for the VM to cluster pages in an way that results in efficient
I/O patterns.
Basically, the only thing really needed from the VFS/VM is a method of tagging
delalloc (or unwritten) pages so that the writepage path knows how to treat
the page being written. Currently we keep that state in bufferheads (e.g. see
buffer_delay() usage) attached to the page......

You don't need to know the final file size - just what is contiguous in the
page cache and in the same state as the page being flushed.
Cheers,
Dave.
