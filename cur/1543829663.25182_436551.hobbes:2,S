agreed.

passing in the type ID wouldnt be that bad and it would have other 
advantages as well: for example we could do strict type-checking of 
allocation size versus type-we-use-it-for.
As long as the conversion is gradual i think we could try this. I.e. 
we'd default to 'no ID passed', and in that case we would fall back to 
the size-based method and generate an ID out of the structure size.

btw., what leaks were found so far? I know about the ACPI one - any 
other ones?
