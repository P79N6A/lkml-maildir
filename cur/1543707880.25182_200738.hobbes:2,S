OK, so everything is stuck trying to allocate memory.  Perhaps you ran out
of swapspace, or some process has gone berzerk allocating memory.
How much memory does the machine have, and how much swap space?
I suggest that you run a `vmstat 30' trace on a terminal somewhere, see what
it says prior to the hangs.  Also capture the sysrq-M output after it has
hung.
It would be useful to monitor the contents of /proc/vmstat also.
And perhaps keep top running in `sort by memory usage' mode.
