If you look at the Received headers in the faked message, it actually
came to kernel.org from alog0102.analogic.com, from Analogic's
208.224.220.0/22 netblock, not from quark.analogic.com (in Analogic's
204.178.40.0/21 block) as it claimed:
Received: from alog0102.analogic.com ([208.224.220.117]:12804 "EHLO
	quark.analogic.com") by vger.kernel.org with ESMTP
	id <S263082AbTCSPfa>; Wed, 19 Mar 2003 10:35:30 -0500
If an analogic box was cracked, look at 208.224.220.117, not at quark.
The routing suggests they would not have been able to spoof the IP,
unless they did so over eg an 802.11 link at whatever site
208.224.220.0/22 is used.
