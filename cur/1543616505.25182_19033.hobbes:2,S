Sure, but if you do that you're *asking*, in a very literal way, for 
your CPU to misidentified.  In fact, a major reason for making this 
string modifiable is due to certain vendors who hard-code CPUID strings 
in their code.

Why -- if it doesn't change anything, all you're doing is making it 
confusing when the next derivative appears.  Remember that we *do* need, 
  as much as possible, to be forward compatible with future CPUs.
