I am experiencing extremely shoddy performance with a similar disk/chipset 
combination.  I am on an Asus P2B-DS board (440BX) with the following disk 
setup.
hda: Maxtor 93073U6, ATA DISK drive
hdc: Maxtor 90840D6, ATA DISK drive
hdd: Maxtor 90840D6, ATA DISK drive
I am barely experiencing the same performance you are, after enabling all the 
stuff that's been discussed in this thread.    I'd like to determine if this 
disk is dying or if there is something seriously wrong with my kernel.  I did 
not seem to experience anything until I went to 2.4.16.  hdd seems to be 
headed for the heap, as all tests on it fail.  I am stumped; I've read the 
manual and the threads and still haven't extracted proper performance.  All 
help is appreciated.
Thanks,
AKK
