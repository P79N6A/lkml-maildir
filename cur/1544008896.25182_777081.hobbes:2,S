Your suggestion led me to the actual problem: the rsync command I was
running to get files to my build machine was missing --delete, which
meant the build machine's tree had all sorts of cruft.
With that change, I can successfully build the latest Linus kernel
without any patches.  Sorry to have wasted everyone's time.
