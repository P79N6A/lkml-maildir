I had to apply the framebuffer patch so that my kernel would not crash
for that reason (this was applied to the original mm3 aswell - forgot to
metnion). Also the percentile tmpfs was applied. Normal kernel works
fine with both patches.
Still, the linus.patch produced the same result. If you think it's
worthwhile I'll compile out the fa and perc patchesb but I didn't think
it significant due to them workign just fine with 2.5.66.

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
