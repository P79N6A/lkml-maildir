No, but it makes sense to have N at least one more than the number of
cpus,
if you have the memory.  This because your processes occationally
will wait for disk io, and this time may then be utilized to
run the "extra" task.  But don't overdo it, as you get less disk
cache this way.  make -j3 seems to be fastest on my 2-cpu machine
with 128M ram.
