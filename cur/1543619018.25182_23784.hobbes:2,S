Not everyone is stupid enough to leave a system unprotected...  I don't send
virii out anymore (and haven't in years and years, I learned that lesson the
hard way, search through the lkml archive for the mail message from the last
time this happened to me) and to eliminate my mailer because everyone on
this list is so rabidly anti-ms is just plain stupid.  If you don't like it,
don't use it - but leave the rest of us FREE (as in CHOICE) to use what we
want to.
