You lost me about what fK is suppose to be.

I don't like your extension because it doesn't mask with pI at the very
least. Your fX is basicly my fI, and your config_option_1 is my pI which I
beleive the executible should decide upon. If an program doesn't want
CAP_FOO to be inherited then it shouldn't include it in pI. That way a
smart binary can call other semi-trusted binaries without permanently
maiming itself in the process by decreasing it's pP.

I do think that you are over-concerned about pI having power.
The pI was designed to flow easily. pI should have been used only as a
mask and never allowed to have this odd side-effect that it might interact
with other files and create caps that the parent never had.
This is our main point of contension.
One thing that might clear things up is if I again reread the posix drafts
and see if I can find any indication that this side-effect was intended
or merely an over-looked aspect of the formula.

I agree with this used sparingly for legacy binaries can save you some
grief-- however it should be used like fE for backwards compatibility
only. Maybe the user just wanted to run `foo --version` or `bar --help`
