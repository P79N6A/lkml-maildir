If _you_ had the experience you pretend, then why do you claim that the fact 
that I cannot use ide-scsi with a PCATA connection to my CD writer is caused
by bad hardware?
As the drive becomes usable with CDROM_SEND_PACKET and is completely unusable 
via ide-scsi it is obvious that the reason cannot be a hardware problem but must 
be a driver design bug.

If this affects the drivers, then there need to be a workaround regardless of 
the driver layering model in use.

Why didn't you read my short abstract I send out yesterday?
