You could take a more radical approach. Since the goal of such
a psinfo file would be to accelerate access to information
that's already available elsewhere, you can do away with many
of the niceties of procfs, e.g.
 - no need to be human-readable (e.g. binary or hex dump may
   make sense in this case)
 - may use other operations than just open and read (e.g.
   do an initial write to select what should be read)
 - you may cache previous responses and only output deltas
   (not sure if this is useful - all you'd safe is the
   actual copy to user space)
Actually, I think attempting to just make it brutally efficient,
no matter how much nastiness you amass doing that, might be
good approach for a first version. Then, if people are
digusted, you can make things nicer, and keep track of how
much performance you're losing.
Example:
First write says "pid,comm". Internally, this gets translated
to 0x8c+0x04, 0x2ee+0x10 (offset+length). Next read returns
"pid 4,comm 16" (include the name, so you can indicate fields
the kernel doesn't recognize). Then, kmalloc 20*tasks bytes,
lock, copy the fields from struct task_struct, unlock, let the
stuff be read by user space, kfree. Adjacent fields can be
optimized to single byte strings at setup time.
