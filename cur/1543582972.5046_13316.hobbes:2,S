First, good job on the loop device. It's rock stable for me - except
when I try to load the blowfish module which oops the kernel and
crashes the loop device:-) No problem, I just use another cipher.
The bug I'm reporting is that when a loop device is in use the load of
the machine stays at 1.00 even though nothing is happening. If I umount
the loop filesystem the load goes down to 0.00.
> ps -aux | grep loop
1674 tty1     DW<   0:00 [loop0]
The system is doing nothing to the loop filesystem.
Strange that the process isn't logging any cpu usage time. It's
definately responsible for the 1.00 load.
