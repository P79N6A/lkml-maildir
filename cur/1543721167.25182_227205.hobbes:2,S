One way to do it (or is this what you meant by captive ioctl?)
userspace daemon loops on ioctl()
kernel portion of ioctl call goes to sleep until something to do
when needed, fill in data and return to userspace
userspace does stuff, then passes data back down via ioctl()
ioctl() puts userspace back to sleep and continues on with other work
