Well is there some possiblility to solve it? I have lots of free memory (300MB)
and it still complains about not enough free memory.
I'm using this:
/sbin/sysctl -w net/core/rmem_max=8388608
/sbin/sysctl -w net/core/wmem_max=8388608
/sbin/sysctl -w net/core/rmem_default=1048576
/sbin/sysctl -w net/core/wmem_default=1048576
/sbin/sysctl -w net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling=1
/sbin/sysctl -w net/ipv4/tcp_rmem="4096 1048576 8388608"
/sbin/sysctl -w net/ipv4/tcp_wmem="4096 1048576 8388608"
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 txqueuelen 1000
