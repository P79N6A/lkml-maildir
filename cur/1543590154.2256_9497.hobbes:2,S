I think you may have compiled in devfs support. You need to run devfsd
so it can map the old device names so programs like mingetty don't freak

The kernel will automagically look for modules in /lib/modules/<kernel
version>/. <kernel version> will be whatever the output of uname -r is
on your currently running kernel.
