Have you people heard about this thing called "branches" ?
- You keep your own code in your own branch.
- You keep Linus's code in a linus branch.
- The patches from Linus always apply to the linus branch.
- You pull Linus's latest updates into your own branch for
  development work, at this point you may need to do some
  merging.  Some SCM systems are horrible at merging (CVS)
  while others are really nice (BK).
No need to (badly) reinvent the wheel, all of this stuff has
been solved for many years now.
regards,
Rik
