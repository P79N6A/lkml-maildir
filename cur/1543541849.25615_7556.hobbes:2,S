OK, forget that statement.
test3 DOES have a problem. It just did not show up the way I expected
it to - the corruption of the active file only happens AFTER inn has
been shutdown and is restarted. While innd is kept running, the file
appears to get updated - but when you restart the server, the updates
are "forgotten" and the file in reality is not updated.
So the server start re-using old article numbers and you have a
problem.
Sorry about that incorrect report. But it looked fine when I wrote it.
