Hi,
I talked with Stephen at the USENIX Technical conference about the
hinting system I have written for poll()/select().
Events get translated into hints. poll()/select() can then decide if
the poll function call for a specific file descriptor can be skipped
because no new events have arrived.
On a loopback benchmark I achieved about a 25% performance improvement
in the reply rate for web requests.
The patches and a small postscript comparison is to be found
at 
http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/linux/.
Please have a look,
 Niels.
