Hi Riley
I think Tom meant that his problem was that if the BIOS itself (on that
particular MB/gfx card) start up in anything else that 80x25 then he have
a problem with the scrolling of the display. It's actually quite
understandable:
Bios knows that were in eg. 80x50 on startup, but linux thinks were in
80x25. Ofcouse you could just say to linux 128x43 and linux would tell the
bios, and everybody is happy. Problem is only at startup
