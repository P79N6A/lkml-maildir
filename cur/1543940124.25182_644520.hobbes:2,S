But for this case, how would we test that 0x18 is passed in for a
pointer to a kobject, without just blowing up instantly no matter what?

Oh, that's a very cool idea, I like it :)
So I guess the complaint is that CONFIG_KOBJECT is too verbose?  I can
understand that, I'll look to clean things up as we have a lot of
"tracing" type functions in the debug output.  Hm, I wonder if the new
marker code could help with that...

I totally agree.

Heh, good point, I'll look into fixing this up to be more useful to the
"normal" developer, and not just the two of us doing kobject core
development :)
