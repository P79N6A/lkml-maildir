If a process does not handle its todo then you cannot freeze the process 
at all. Something very baaaad is going on. The current version gives up if 
a process cannot be frozen. This is still doing the same.

Yes other tasks can be put on the notifier later. But the freeze notifier 
was first so the task is put to sleep and will run the other notifiers 
upon wakeup. The check is still okay. No additional notification should be 
added if the freeze notifier is already queued.

The patch you sent looks fine to me.
