Because there is a race between checking inode->i_flock and
inode->i_flock->fl_flags which a couple of people have actually
hit ... The check for FL_EASE is done again in __get_lease
but protected by the BKL.
This is just an optimisation and having the check here is only
faster in the case where there is a lock held that is NOT a lease.
This was the race fix provided by Willy.
