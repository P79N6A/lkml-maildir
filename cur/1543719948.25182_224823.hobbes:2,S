One caveat: you *may* have to create "one disk RAID-0" arrays of your
disks (which is equivalent to the single disk), in order to make the
SATA controller boot from the disk.  So, with two disks, you would
create two RAID-0 arrays, each containing one disk.  Silly really, but
at least I had to do this with the Promise TX4.
Other than that; Standard Linux SATA drivers + Software RAID + LVM2 is a
beautiful all-open-source solution for cheap flexible and reliable
storage  -  my mom is using that   ;)
