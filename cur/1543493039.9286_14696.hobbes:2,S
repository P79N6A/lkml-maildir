Hi,

Yes, we know it is an FAQ and everybody knows the correct answer "get the
latest ping" but, even the best Linux distributions (you know who you
are!) still come with the ping(8) that says 95% packet loss on lo.
Hope they take notice of this and correct their behaviour (while they are
at it I hope they also trim down the /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit file which I
always have to manually shorten (by almost an order of magnitude)).
Regards,
