PPP uses a nonstandard deviant of zlib, or *so I've been told*, so
that one is out.
The reason it's in fs is because I wasn't feeling sure that the memory
management as implemented is adequate for non-fs-related
applications.  I might change that, though, but I wanted to move
somewhat slowly.
Memory management in zlib is nontrivial.  If you port the user-space
zlib the "obvious" way to kernel space, you get memory management that
is completely unacceptable to a filesystem application -- too easy to
get random errors due to memory allocation failures.
A major problem is that the module name "deflate" is used by PPP,
despite it being a nonstandard format...
