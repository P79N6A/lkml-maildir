I then tried rebooting 2.5.27-rmap-slablru with /home mounted as ext3,
and immediately after starting dbench 1, I got this message about 10
times or so:
ENOMEM in do_get_write_access, retrying.
And the box was locked up.  Next time, I'll have CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y.
Meanwhile, it is running the dbench 1 to 64 series under 2.4.19-rc3 with
no problems at all.
