long sys_fallocate(loff_t offset, loff_t len, int fd, int mode)
should work for everybody.  The compat handler would be
long compat_sys_fallocate(u32 offset_hi, u32 offset_lo, u32 len_hi, u32 len_lo,
			  int fd, int mode)
for big-endian, or swap hi/lo for little-endian.  (Actually it would
be good to have an arch-dependent "stitch two args together" macro and
call them offset_0, offset_1 etc.)
