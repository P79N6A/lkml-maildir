Something completely different.. Perhaps userspace?
I'm using a streamzap USB ir remote with lirc. I have a modified version of Nils Faebers kbdd 
package that does the translation and injects the packets into /dev/misc/uinput.
Whammo. Userspace IR remote to keyboard translator.
You may want to do it in kernel space however. I'm just throwing it out there.
Modified version here

Ugly and bad code is most probably mine :p)
If you have a good reason to keep it in kernel space, them my argument is null and void :p)
It's nice being able to specify Remote->Key maps on a per app basis depending on what you are 
running at the time.
Makes controlling bash scripts using dialog really easy by remote :p)
Regards,
Brad
