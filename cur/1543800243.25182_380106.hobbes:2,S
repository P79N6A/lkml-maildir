The long latency in idle (trace2) is definitely *not* printk related:
It appears without any printk going on.
If I remember correctly, trace3 and trace5 were also taken
without any printk's happening, I'm not sure about trace4 
(my module init function writes a message).
MyThread is a kernel thread of mine which definitely calls printk,
so trace1 and trace7 (and perhaps trace6) could be printk-related.
However, it never ever explicitely locks preemption, interrupts or 
anything similar, especially not around the printk's, and there are
no other printk's happening during the tests.
Hence: printk's yes, printk's with preemption disabled not that I
am aware of.
However, in the meantime I found out that I can generate almost any
latency (exceeding 1 sec!) with massive printk's, no matter if they 
go to the fb console or the sio or both (only if both are disabled
printk doesn't seem to cause long latencies).
That's even the case when the interrupt jitter test program runs
at a higher rt priority than the printk kernel thread.
Why that and what to do against it?
