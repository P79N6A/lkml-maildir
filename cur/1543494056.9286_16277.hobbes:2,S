 	Hi,
 	I had a problem when i compile the kernel and the ipx protocol was
 in module, when i type modprobe ipx this message appear:
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol unregister_8022_client_R7acef15d
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol register_snap_client_Rd6360086
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol make_EII_client
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol make_8023_client
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol destroy_8023_client
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol destroy_EII_client
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol unregister_snap_client_R9abefc50
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol register_8022_client_R097b645a
 	And this message changes after i left the computer power on, and i
 receive now this message:
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol make_EII_client
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol make_8023_client
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol destroy_8023_client
 /lib/modules/2.2.6/misc/ipx.o: unresolved symbol destroy_EII_client
 	What do i have to do???
 	Someone can help me????????
 
 	THERE IS one more thing that i don't understand: on kernel 2.0.x
 the ipx had started without any problem. The problem occured when a change
 from 2.0.x to 2.2.x on i386 machines. 
 	And on sparc machines, i did the same thing and i DO
 NOT had problem with the ipx!!!!!
 
 	Thanks for any help...
