The generic patent workaround: come up with something ever-so-slightly
better and patent it.  For example: given a patented compression
algorithm, if you can come up with a new one that
a) compresses files over 5GB to 1 bit less than the original
b) adds some implicit redundancy coding.
c) runs 1% faster on a PCjr  or
d) uses 4 bytes less memory.

So how would you structure the government?  It is awfully hard to come up
with a system in which the ability to lead plays a major role.
