It is OT, but if you are interested, take a look at include/private/*atomic*,
include/private/*/*atomic* and relevant portions (ncphost) of configure.ac 
in the ncpfs package (
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/ftp/pub/linux/ncpfs/ncpfs-2.2.3.tar.gz
).
It contains UP, pthread based, and several asm optimized versions of
atomic ops. I'm not 100% sure that all asm versions work correctly,
but I have received no complaints yet...
