This would only be required if you'd upgrade the userspace kernel 
headers on this system to a version not matching the ones glibc was 
built against - and this has never been considered a good idea
(it should work in theory, but not with our current header mess).

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
