I'd just suggest Dave just registers a shrinker to start with.
You really want to be able to batch TLB flushes as well, which
->releasepage may not be so good at (you could add more machinery
behind the releasepage to build batches and so on, but anyway, a
shrinker might be the quickest way to get something working).
