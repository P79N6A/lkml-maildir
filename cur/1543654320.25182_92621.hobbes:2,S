I have two _big_ beefs with the 
	__kernel_xxx_t32
naming:
 - the xxx_t naming is already ugly, but at least it's standard ("_t 
   stands for typedef"). No such case is true for _t32.
 - the __kernel_ naming is already ugly, but at least it has a _reason_ 
   for it, namely that we have to have __ to avoid polluting user-space
   headers with the _one_ thing that the kernel exports, namely
   architecture types. Again, this is _not_ true for the compat32 stuff, 
   since it's an ABI, not an API issue, and the types aren't exposed to
   user space headers.
In short, it's f*cking ugly, for no good reason.  That in itself is _way_ 
enough reason to say "No FRIGGING WAY!".
The original patch was worse by an order of magnitude for _another_ 
reason, which has nothing to do with naming:
Note that I'm not against having architecture-specific "compat32 types". 
HOWEVER, if they are architecture-specific, then they had better not be in 
a generic file. So it's just _fundamentally_ wrong to have a <linux/xxx.h> 
file that then has "architecture-specific" stuff in it. That's just CRAP.
So the naming is just ugly (but ugly enough that I don't want to see it). 
The real crap is having a architecture-independent file that defines 
non-generic types.
I suspect that the correct way to do things is:
 - have an <asm/compat32.h> for the types. The types _are_ different for 
   different architectures, even if 90% of them look really really 
   similar. It's just not worth it trying to share code that is not 
   fundamentally the same - and in this case it isn't.
   This fixes the fundamental objection I had to <linux/compat32.h>
 - use sane naming. Something like "compat32_nlink_t" is sane. Something 
   like "__kernel_nlink_t32" is not.
You might as well also discuss just dropping the "32" from "compat32"  
while you're at it. As far as I can tell the code and the fundamental
issue has nothing to do with 32-bitness per se. It has everything to do
with compatibility with an older ABI. The 32-bitness is a implementation
detail, there's nothing that fundamentally says the same compat code might
not work with a 64(user)->128(kernel) bit (or a 16->32 bit) compatibility
layer.
