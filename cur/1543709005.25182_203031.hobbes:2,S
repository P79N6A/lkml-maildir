Hello list,
Excuse me for not finding this if it has been asked before. Please Cc any answers, as I am not subscribed to this list.
I am trying to port a driver for the Realtek 8180 wireless ehternet controller from 2.4 to 2.6. The module comes as a binary-only object file with some sources that can be adapted to fit the specific kernel. My problem is that I can't figure out how to get the 2.6 kernel to include the binary part (it's in a .o file). The new build system does a little too much magic - compiling the module from source to .ko without giving me a chance to sneak in the binary code. How do I get it to link in the .o file, without making it look for the like-named .c file?
Cheers,
Robbert Haarman
