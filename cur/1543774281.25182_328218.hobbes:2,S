I'm blaming myself for not having given a closer look before shutting
down the machine.
But, as I said, the shut down happened regularly. Later, to be sure, i
ran an fsck on all partitions and they were ok.

It was the first time: this machine had been running on the same
kernel for six month with very long uptimes interrupted only by ups
control daemon (during blackouts).
Ah, no: the kernel had been changed about one month ago, but it was
the same version (2.4.26) and the same .config (except ext3 support
which I moved from modules to kernel itself).
