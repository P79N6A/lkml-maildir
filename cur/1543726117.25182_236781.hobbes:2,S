One problem with debugging. I ran 2.6.7-1 like this:
./K2.6.7 debug ubd0=ROOT1 mem=32M
In xterm shows:
Checking for the skas3 patch in the host...not found
Checking for /proc/mm...not found
tracing thread pid = 14253
Then, in the debugging xterm:

This is a Slackware 10.
No patches on host (also 2.6.7).
How can I help debugging this problem?
Thanks!
