Aye. Most .config options got lost in the upgrade (I've had to reset
most of them so far).
One question. Should PCMCIA_AHA152X only be compilable as a module? I
found this in Kconfig:
config PCMCIA_AHA152X
        tristate "Adaptec AHA152X PCMCIA support"
        depends on m
        help
          Say Y here if you intend to attach this type of PCMCIA SCSI host
          adapter to your computer.
	  ...
The help and the tristate seems to indicate that I should be able to
compile it into the kernel, but menuconfig wont let me. This is
presumably due to the dependancy but is it right?
