I am not trying to sabotage these changes, and I am sorry if it looked
that way.
I jumped into this discuassion because both patches I saw (Daniel's and
Gregory's) were very wrong technically.
Yes, I still disagree with the whole idea because I hope we can make
something more simpler to solve the problem, but I must admit I don't
quite understand what the problem is.
So, please consider a noise from my side as my attempt to help. And
in fact, I am very curious about -rt tree, just I never had a time
to study it :)
Oleg.
