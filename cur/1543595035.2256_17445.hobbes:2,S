That's the old ipchains code; if it's buggy it's likely buggy in 2.2 
too. In fact 2.2 ip_fw.c has exactly the same problem (and also a panic
on OOM) 
iptables is supposed to be somewhat better (that's the new code), with
cleaner locking.
-Andi, wondering why the Stanford Checker didn't catch that.
P.S.: Could you please always change the subject in future when going
from slashdot niveau material to real kernel bugs on l-k. thanks.
