Sure it is. I mean, it uses only VESA (extended VGA) registers and
doesn't know anything about present bliters, backend scalers or
similar hw features, AFAIK.
I think DirectFB guy have right approach, only they do it from user
space. fbdev should be capable of detecting present chip(s) and load
appropriate (acceleration) module, which describes hardware more
precisely.
If there is no specific (fbdev) driver module for your gfx then
everything should work with generic (VESA) one, though it would be
somewhat slower.
