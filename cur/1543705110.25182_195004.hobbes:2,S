Randomisation of vDSO and randomisation of PIE, or non-PIE objects
which don't get mapped where you intended all break prelinking.  In
this regard vDSO is no different to any other library.
I agree that any uses of randomisation tend to break prelinking, and
so it's not reasonable to depend solely on prelinking.
