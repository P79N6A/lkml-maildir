Too simple to work, unfortunately.  We have to at least 1) lock the
page and 2) remove it from the page cache.  Can we remove a page from
the page cache while it still has pte references?  I suppose we can,
it turns into an anonymous page.  But isn't that the reason we didn't
do it in invalidate_inode_pages in the first place?  However, since
we now, in addition, mark the page invalidated, it doesn't matter any
more what kind of page it is, so I suppose that's ok.
And we need a locked_page_cache_release->free_locked_page.
