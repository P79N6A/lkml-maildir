Note: I never suggested going beyond #3.

Those sizes are unreadable on the 200 dpi OLPC XO screen,
and kind of icky on some of the really big desktop displays
when in native (framebuffer) mode. 200 dpi may be in your future.
Even the 32-pixel height limit is starting to be a problem.

It's been shown to be workable, and it allows support for
some additional languages.

I agree. Hebrew is more doable, but probably not worth the effort
because of the rarity and because of the general lack of support
in text mode apps for such odd behavior. Very few emulators
support this; kermit95 is one of the few.

I hope you didn't think I was suggesting this. It's quite absurd.
"Complex shaping, glyph substitution, and vertical text." was the
full item listed. Vertical is the least troublesome of those issues,
and as far as I know has never been implemented.

I wouldn't say that. We suffer the bloat of all this UTF-8 stuff
without being able to load a decent-sized font to go with it.
We're stuck at 256 characters really, with the very lame option
of trading foreground color intensity control for an extra 256.
I think one could make a reasonable argument that all the
internationalization is bloat, and that thus UTF-8 should go.
Given that we do support UTF-8 though, allowing a font with
more than 256 characters (with foreground intensity control)
is obviously sensible.
