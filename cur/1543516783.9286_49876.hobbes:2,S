Hello,
I'm debugging a new synchronous card driver, and even though the driver
seems stable, sometimes I get kernel oopsen like the one below when doing 
an FTP reception transfer:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address c4834824
current->tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
*pde = 00000000

Call Trace:
Code:
The weird thing about it is that there is no call trace nor code to be
used in the ksymoops. If I try to use all I got in ksymoops (i.e., the
output shown above), it doesn't return anything, i.e., it stays there
waiting for actually useful data to come in.
Is there any way to figure out what is causing this kernel oops !?!?
Without the call trace / code, it's useless to me, so if somebody could
shed some light on it for me, I'd really appreciate it.
If you need more info (e.g., /proc/ksyms, System.map, etc.), please let me
know in PVT.
TIA and Regards,
Ivan
