Big words but mere rhetoric IMHO... You would first have to prove that 
combining the two structures (vfs and fs inodes) is an actual "perfection" 
compared to the case where they are individual, which is what I am not 
convinced about.
Due to the nature of the content in the vfs vs. fs inode I would expect 
that one is used independent of the other in many, if not in the majority 
of cases. If this is correct, then it might well be an actual benefit to 
have the two separate and to benefit from the hwcache line alignment in the 
fs specific part. Also considering that allocation happens once in 
read_inode but the structure is then accessed many times.
Please note, I am not saying you are wrong, most likely you are quite right 
in fact, I am just raising a caution flag that perhaps benchmarks of both 
implementations for the same fs might be a Good Idea(TM)...
Best regards,
Anton
