Not really, it makes the clock more stable and less suspectible to 
network delays.
I think a big part of the problem is that our calibration code could use 
some improvements, I've seen some widely different initial drift values 
from one reboot to the next, which is the main reason ntp has to do that 
much initial work in the first place.
