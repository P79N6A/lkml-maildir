Most likely to minimise the number of cache misses needed
to access a complete page_struct.
Then again, I guess 48 bytes would _also_ guarantee that
we never need more than 2 cache misses to access every
part of the page_struct.
And the memory wasted in the page_struct may well be a
bigger factor than the cache misses on lots of systems...
(time for another CONFIG option? ;))
