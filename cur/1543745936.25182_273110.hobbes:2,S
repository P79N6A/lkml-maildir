hello,
          In ip_output.c file ip_fragmet function when
create a new fragmented packet given to output(skb)
function. i want to know which function are actually
called by output(skb)?
          Is that function ip_finish_output? if yes
then fragmented packet has not gone through netfilter
hooks specially NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT?
          so does that mean fragmented packets not
travel through netfilter hooks?
regards,
cranium
