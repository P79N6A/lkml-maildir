Perhaps I didn't make myself clear: hotplugging does not neccessarily
mean physically removing or adding the CPU.  And as to whether they
offer full support, or stub support, architectures can decide that for
themselves, as they need.  It's not my call.
I don't know how much of a win it is to disable HT on cpus, but I can
tell you that adding & subtracting CPUs is a fairly heavy-weight
operation in this design (I don't think we really want to lock around
every cpu iteration).
