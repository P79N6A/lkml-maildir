If the driver is not ported to the device API, than we pass NULL as a
device pointer, and then we fallback to the old behaviour, aka
dma_mask=0x00ffffff. If the driver supplies a dev pointer, but fails
to set its dma_mask pointer, than it is a driver bug that should be
fixed.
And yes, the EISA subsystem should properly report the dma_mask to
attached devices (patches for that are in mm tree, and sent to Linus).
