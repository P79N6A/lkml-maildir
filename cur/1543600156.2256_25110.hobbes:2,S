OK then maybe we need a flush_icache_user_range or something.

Yes, that is what Documentation/cachetlb.txt says.  I note that
currently flush_icache_range is used on user addresses in
binfmt_aout.c, and in fs/binfmt_elf.c in the load_aout_interp()
function.  But nobody uses a.out these days so that doesn't matter. :)

flush_icache_page is not a good function to use because it is called
in do_swap_page and in do_no_page in mm/memory.c and in those cases
the page might already be i-cache clean and so we don't want to do any
flush.  In those cases, if the page does actually get read in from
disk then we do want to do the flush, if it was in the page cache or
swap cache and has been flushed before then we don't want to do the
flush.  (Actually doesn't that mean that on alpha you are throwing
away the whole icache for the process every time it faults in an
executable page?)
flush_icache_page is also not a good choice because it is overkill to
flush a whole page when you have just written one word, to put in a
breakpoint or something.

I would be happy with an interface that took a struct page *, and
preferably an offset and length within the page.  That would be a new
interface though.  Note that the caller of access_process_vm can't
easily do the flush without duplicating most of the logic of
access_process_vm.
