Subject: [BUG] wait_for_devfsd_finished deadlock

While testing 2.4.17-pre1 with some other patches, a situation
reminiscent of a deadlock arose. mutt(1) would block indefinitely
while opening a large mbox, and all further calls to sys_open()
would block indefinitely.
After some further testing to isolate the problem, I reproduced
this behavior in the vanilla 2.4.17-pre1 kernel. The sysrq output showed
a number of processes with the following call trace in the devfs core:
Dec  1 17:29:26 holomorphy kernel: sh            D C02A2A00     0   821    806

And the following call traces elsewhere:

Further diagnostic information is available upon request.
Mr. Gooch, your attention to this matter is much appreciated.
Thanks,
Bill
