Semaphore :-)
Do you expect this to be heavily contended?  On a very quick run through the 
code, it seems you don't hold any spinlocks going into the driver from 
process context.  Interrupts... they better fit into a 4K stack or it's game 
over.  Preemption while on the ndis stack... you can always disable 
preemption in this region, but the semaphore should protect you.  Task killed 
while preempted... I dunno.

I expect the userspace approach will be a lot more work and a lot more 
overhead too, but then again it sounds like loads of fun.
