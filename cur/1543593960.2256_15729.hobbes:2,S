The problem is related to the default NLSP (NetWare Link State Routing)

RIP/SAP all the time, and if ipx_configure is set to --auto-interface=on
--auto-primary=on, the ipx client in Linux will not set it's IPX 
address until it sees some traffic.  This is usually a problem in 
setups with only one server on the entire network, since the server
won't RIP/SAP right away.  
Simply go to the NetWare 5.X server, and type at the console
:
:reset router
:
and this should cause the 5.1 server to send an old-style RIP/SAP frame
which will then kick on all the Linux systems.  You will notice that each 
time you turn off your linux machine, you will have to type this on the 
NetWare 5.x server console in order to get the server to kick out a 
RIP/SAP frame and allow the Linux box to auto-detect the network address.
One way around this is to hard set the network address via ipx_configure
and the problem is less troublesome.
