Hello!
There is a bug (I suppose) in file linux/boot/i386/kernel/mpparse.c. I
have laptop Amilo L 7300 and during the kernel boot, I get:
SMP mptable: bad table version
BIOS bug, MP table errors detectd!...
And I just even have one processor. I had to remove kernel options
connected with lapic (added previously to kernel command line).
Some time ago Alan Cox said:
"No actually its our bug. Some BIOSes contain template SMP tables which have
intentionally incomplete data and no checksum. This is used by the BIOS to
generate a real table if SMP is present.
We should not be reporting a wrongly checksummed SMP table we should be
skipping it silently. This used to be right in 2.0 but someone has obviously
elevated debugging code too far since.
Alan"

So I think it should be fixed :). Thanks,
