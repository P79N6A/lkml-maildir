Hello,
I'm working on a driver for one of our devices with some heavy DMA
memory requirements - 20 - 30 MB in all.  As a loadable module (perfect
for development stage), the driver frequently causes annoying OOM
problems.
Is there a quick solution to this problem, like increasing the size of
the physically contiguous page pool (like in Windows NT and some other
OS'es :-( )? (Is it a good idea to make this one of the future
enhancements to Linux?)  Or should I write a driver loaded at boot time
grabbing the required memory pages and allocating them to my loadable
driver when requested?
Your suggestion is very much appreciated.
Regards,
Anthony Dominic Truong.
