Dag Frank -
I see lots of messages from you about corruption in 2.4.0-test11
but we all know very well that 2.4.0-test11 corrupts things
and further evidence is not necessary.
Hopefully all, or at least the most significant, problems
have been solved now, so you should upgrade to the most
recent test kernel and see how things are there.
