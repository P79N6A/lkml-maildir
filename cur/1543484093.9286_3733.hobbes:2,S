Might be a nice feature for gtk-mconfig.  I'm not interested in new
features for xconfig.

Over in the Dancing Makefiles, I already made CONFIG_OLD_SMALL_ZIMAGE
a configuration flag.  I think it work pretty nice.  The problem is
that the "zImage/bzImage" interface exists in a million people's
heads and it will take some careful engineering and documentation to
mess with that.
