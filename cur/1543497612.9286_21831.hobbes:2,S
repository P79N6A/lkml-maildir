I never meant to give that implication.  I object to Linus' claim that
these sorts of installations are unsupported because they are too hard
to do in the current PCMCIA architecture.  It's a simple space issue:
adding PCMCIA to an initrd, when you're already committed to the
initrd framework, is not rocket science.  That doesn't mean it is a
non-issue.
