These "Indian Nations" create and use special meanings for
common words. For instance "No" becomes a "No clause" that
could mean "yes" in certain instances like bypassing state
taxes and running casinos. They have even been able to resurrect
"tribes" that have long ago been assimilated and their
"reservations" sold as farm land. Mohegan comes to mind.
I suspect that the proposed "Act" displayed on the www.gagugi.org
web-page is either a hoax, some kind of hard-to-understand joke,
or the scribblings of idiots.
