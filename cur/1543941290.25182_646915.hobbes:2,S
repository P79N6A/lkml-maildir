Subject: [PATCH 0/5] isdn: fix section mismatch warnings in isdn

drivers/isdn resulted in 34 section mismatch warnings - so
I decided to give them a try.
This resulted in 5 simple patches.
I know Jeff Garzik has some ISDN clean-up patches pending
but rather than waiting forever to have them acked I deciced
to fix the warnings in the current kernel.
This for no other reason than to get the noise level down.
Andrew - I expect you to pick them up in -mm and forward to Linus.
