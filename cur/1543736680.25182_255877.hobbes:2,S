Nice try :) but if a card needs a firmware to operate you most likely will
not be able to access any network resources, including PXE. Only some form
of local storage can contain kernel and firmware in this case and I would
think it will be awailable at resume time as well.
Anyway, since there are other kind of devices besides network cards that
have to be availabe before userspace comes up and a generic solution is
always better I think that this part of thread is turning into offtopic...
