Hi,
What I think is the final bug in this code....
latest bug re-producable 
# mount -t nfs -o tcp,nolock localhost:/misc /blah
# ls -la /blah
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root         3892 Jan 19 22:03 1
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root         3893 Jan 19 22:03 2
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root         3894 Jan 19 22:03 3
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root         3895 Jan 19 22:03 4
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root         3896 Jan 19 22:04 5

# cat /blah/1  <-- works
# cat /blah/6  <-- works 
# cat /blah/x 2<=x<=5 and it will hang
The file in the kernel fs/Config.in just happens to be 3894 bytes which is
what triggered it for me originally ..
So it is an RPC problem between the server and client as I can create file
size like that fine on Solaris clients with Linux servers and Linux
clients and Solaris servers ....
So does anyone know where I should start looking glibc's RPC code, nfsd
RPC code or my the kernel NFS over TCP client code? or any idea why this
might happen ..
Dave.
