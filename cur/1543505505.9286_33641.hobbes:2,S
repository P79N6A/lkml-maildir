Hi,
I've just skipped from 2.2.9 to 2.2.11 (I didn't like some of the problem
reports I saw for 2.2.10), and now I get LOADS of the following messages at
boot time:
(scsi1:0:1:0) Data overrun detected in Data-In phase, tag 1;
  Have seen Data Phase. Length=255, NumSGs=1.
     sg[0] - Addr 0xffc8480 : Length 255
(scsi1:0:1:0) Data overrun detected in Data-In phase, tag 1;
  Have seen Data Phase. Length=255, NumSGs=1.
     sg[0] - Addr 0xffc8480 : Length 255
Looking at the 2.2.11 patch, it updates aic7xxx, so I guess that's where the
version change happened.
The strange thing is that if I wait long enough, it eventually resets itself
into a peaceful state and gets on with life. Something like this seems to
happen every couple of releases/updates of the aic7xxx driver! I guess I chose
the wrong hardware :-(
To be more accurate the hardware is: Dual AIC-7895 Ultra, with Tagged queueing
enabled in the driver (Version 5.1.19/3.2.4)
Same setup for the previous driver has no problems. I've never foung any clues
in the READMEs (Yes I DO read them when I get problems :-)
Thanks for any clues.
Regards,
Steve
