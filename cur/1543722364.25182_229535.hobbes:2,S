You cold just rename your Makefile to makefile. Then GNU Make will select that one
as first choice.
Today kbuild unconditionally overwrite the Makefile, because it depends on the following:
- Top level Makefile (VERSION)
- scripts/mkmakefile script
- Source directory
- Output directory
In total too many factors to check for so the more brutal approach used.
Do you use your specific Makefile for something others could benefit from?
