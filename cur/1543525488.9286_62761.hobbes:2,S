Basically, my current driver (in the input patches, an older version is
at 
http://www.suse.cz/development/input
) allows zeroes to be set as a
prefix, although normally ignores them. And, they're not exactly buffer
overflow - they mean 'ambiguous key combination pressed' - ie. too many
keys pressed to confuse the keyboard matrix.
