Please add the 'NEXT' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git
to your list.  This is a throwaway meta-branch that is rebased often.
The 'master' branch of libata-dev.git always contains the base commit 
from torvalds/linux-2.6.git from which all other branches are based.  I 
never ever commit to the 'master' branch, only update it from 
torvalds/linux-2.6.git.
Andrew,
I will continue to maintain the 'ALL' branch exactly as before.  It may 
contain changes not suitable for 'NEXT', but suitable for -mm testing.
In my new development process, things will almost always land in 'ALL' 
before 'NEXT'.
