i've started to take on a "tought luck" attitude -- we're dealing in areas
where the unix API is slightly wrong, and few folks actually use these
features.  (we use the feature in apache to work around a bug in solaris
libc though ;)  and part of my logic is saying that if you do have an app
with such arcane requirements then by all means run it in its own special
process and communicate with it via HTTP and don't worry about it
polluting your high-performance critical path code with silly
restrictions.

nah i like the clone flags.
i'm just pointing out that in addition to accept(), open() and socket()
(oh and pipe()) also create fds :)
for open() we could add an O_FREELIST or O_FREEDOM or something.  we'd
have to create a new socket2() to add a flags argument.

:)
in some configurations the switch would need to have hard storage...
because one of the functions of this light front-end is static file
service (or cached "almost static" serving where a dynamic backend gives a
cacheable HTTP response and the proxy doesn't need to re-request it
again).
the basic criteria i have for this type of front-end is that if the box
running it dies, you can just put a newly formatted/installed box in its
place, and you haven't lost any data.  the philosophy is that an ops team
can just keep a bunch of these around as hot spares and use layer-2
routing to throw the packets at whichever one is live.  it works pretty
well in practice.  these front-ends essentially never die, it's always the
backends which kick over.
