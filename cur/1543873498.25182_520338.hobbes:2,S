A cleanup of the driver-core source is long overdue, that's why we like
everything that goes away here, that isn't really needed. :)
In the end, we should probably just get rid of the whole "struct
subsystem". We can move the lock to the kset and ditch the whole weird
idea of a "subsystem", which is nothing but a collection of ksets, which
the object model can handle without "struct subsystem" just fine.
Thanks,
Kay
