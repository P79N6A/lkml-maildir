On many platforms, only read() is guaranteed to reliably report errors

Might be useful to know more though, wether it was PIO or MMIO or other
things. Also, I'd like to carry around the possible error details as can
be returned by the firmware in some platforms.
In fact, Is there any reason this is not ioerr_cookie instead of
iocookie ? :)
