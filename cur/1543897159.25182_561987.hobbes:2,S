Soft mixing is actually the biggest issue because if you had
generalized soft-mixing in the kernel-visible audio ports[1] you would
win two things:
- programs could use the OSS API without interfering with the ALSA one
  or which each other
- programs coult use the ALSA kernel API directly without interfering
  either, which would allow alternative libalsa implementations for
  those who hate the current one
Frankly, mandatory libraries are extremely annoying, and mandatory
extremely complex overdesigned libraries are simply unbearable.
  OG.
[1] Which does *not* mean doing the mixing in the kernel.
