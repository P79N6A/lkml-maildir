While I agree that your argument is correct generally, what I'd like
to discuss is a specific technical concern with the _change_.  Well,
you may have a big picture of NFS than me, so I just say my thought
here...
I attach the change (of my current version against 2.4.18) again, so
that we can focus the issue.
Here, the non-patched implementation checks inode correctness and
fails in:
	nfs_refresh_inode: inode XXXXXXX mode changed, OOOO to OOOO
I think there is nothing to be useful in client side inode data, when
inode->i_count == 0.  So, it doesn't make sense to check correctness
with this.
Provided the file handle is eternal thing, it doesn't fail...
IMO, it's no use to check the correctness for the inode when ->i_count == 0.
We can reuse the memory of the client side inode, that's true,
but we don't need to check old data against new one at that time.
BTW, I got positive feedback with this change.

	* fs/nfs/inode.c (nfs_read_inode): Don't set inode->i_rdev here.
	(nfs_fill_inode): But set it here, instead.
	(nfs_find_actor): Reusing cached inode, clear ->i_mode.
