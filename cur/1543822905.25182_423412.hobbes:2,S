One user, running an old version of HAL, on a distro that had an updated
version available (Gentoo), refused to upgrade it and was upset that
when they plugged a usb-storage device in, it did not show up as an icon
on the desktop.
Andrew pointed out that we broke the "don't break the userspace API"
kernel rule, so I put the patch back, and noted when it would finally be
removed.
I would gladly remove it again if everyone can agree that they will not
get upset at me again when someone running obsolete/broken userspace
programs complains...
thanks,
