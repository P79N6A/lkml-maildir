Indeed, in PINE, mails with your address in Cc get preprended with a
minus sign, mails with your addr in To gets prepended with a plus
sign, conveniently marking the discussions one has taken part in. (Or
alternatively, one can use 'select all mails with my address' to
color-highlight it.) Pretty nifty.

Well actually, I think it would go into drivers/input/. It is not
quite obvious.
Wireless USB -- drivers/net/wireless, not drivers/usb/
Serial USB   -- drivers/usb/serial, not drivers/serial/usb/
for example, but it seems to flow well anyway.
