capable is needed to be checked, as we are not modifying the existing
permission logic.

I'll let Stephen answer that one, as SELinux uses it.
Oops, ok, nevermind, I don't see _any_ security module using this hook.
In fact they are using the capable(CAP_SYS_RAWIO) hook, which is exactly
what you suggest :)
I'll go remove it.

Ok, again, no one is using it.  I'll go remove it (and go audit all of
the other hooks.)

Bah, ok, again no one uses these either.
Consider me roasted, I'll go audit this whole thing to try to justify
every one of the hooks we ask for.
Very sorry for bothering people.
