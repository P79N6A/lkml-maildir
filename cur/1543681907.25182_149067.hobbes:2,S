Yes, the module loads fine now.
I have a couple of questions regarding this card (M-Audio Revolution 7.1) and ALSA if you'll humour me.
A) Does the driver support more than 2 channels of sound?  I've had no luck getting output out of anything but the analog front channel.
B) Instead of the typical <Master> <PCM> <Line> etc channels in alsamixer I have DAC[1-7], with the front left & right channel being <DAC> and <DAC1>.  Is this normal?
C) mplayer (
http://www.mplayerhq.hu
) compiled with alsa support will detect the card but fails a snd_pcm_hw_params_set_format call.  It will work fine via OSS emulation however.  The same build of mplayer works fine via alsa with other cards, tho.  Is this a driver problem, a hardware limitation, or a problem in mplayer?
Thanks.
