Well, that's why we don't enable BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY nor any of the merging
at the BIO level, at least we didn't on ppc64 when I last worked on the code.
We let the BIO generate things that will always fit. We just have pci_map_*
do merging on a "best it can" basis. Most of the time, it does end up merging
a lot.
I don't think any driver control would help much here ...
Ben.
