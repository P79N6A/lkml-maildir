The whole fscking point is to _avoid_ special API.  System calls.  Normal,
usual system calls and nothing else.
And frankly, moving out of the kernel tree is the least of my worries -
if it's a normal userland code it's fine with me.
I don't see any problems with having the first component of image
generated when you build the kernel - as the matter of fact you
want that, since there is no reason to have nfsroot code there if you
don't support NFS, etc.
