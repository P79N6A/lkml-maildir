HI !
Its a trivial change to the top level Makefile
  CFLAGS_KERNEL   = -fverbose-asm
that would make the output of commands like:
  make kernel/sched.s
quite a lot more readable when decoding oops messages. 
There should be no arch dependencies as far as I know. So is there 
any reason why -fverbose-asm is not on by default in CFLAGS_KERNEL
or was it just not yet suggested ?
