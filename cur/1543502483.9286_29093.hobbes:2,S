	I have tested it, it works (but didn't find why - or why setting
it to 0 or 1 does not work). This must be hard-coded somewhere,
the TC_PRIO_CONTROL is not used anywhere.
	Gergely, can you send Alan the patches to syncppp.c and dev.c?
I think it should be incorporated in the kernel sources.
	BTW, I have found another problem with syncppp.c. In Sync PPP mode
it does not work when I manually ifconfig one of the ends down and then up.
It seems the LCP does not end. It helps to unplug the line physically
for MAXALIVECNT keepalive packets - both ends then will agree the line
is down and restart the LCP from the beginning.
	I can attach the debug output, but this one is easy to reproduce.
I have to leave the Net for ~14 days, so I cannot dig into it further.
Any ideas?
