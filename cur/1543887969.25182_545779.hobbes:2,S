i386 exhausts lowmem very quickly.  SCSI is in a bit better shape than 
network devices as the multiplier is only around 4 compared to 16 for network 
devices.
My point stands, though.  Forcing every new feature to go in via sysfs is 
not the right thing to do.  Some people don't/can't use it, please remember 
them.
