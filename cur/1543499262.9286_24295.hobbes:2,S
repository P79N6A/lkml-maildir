Greetings,
I just found this in my log files:
 kmem_grow: Called nonatomically from int - size-32
This is on 2.3.5 SMP, compiled with egcs-2.91.66. It happened while I was 
logging in under X right after booting. I'm assuming it not to be trivial 
to reproduce, since this is the first time it happened and I have not 
changed my configuration since installing 2.3.5 on June 4.
If anyone out there is interested in this, just let me know, including 
the kind of info about my kernel that would be of interest. 
MCE
