    I've got an Apacer SM/CF combo reader too. I found your email :
            I just got myself an Apacer SM/CF combo reader, USB 07c4:a109. 
            The CF part is supported in the stock kernel (by datafab.c), 
            the SM part is not. 
            This evening I wrote a read-only driver; hope to add the 
            writing part soon.

    Does your driver work well ?
Yes, it reads and writes without problems, both CF and SM,
assuming the surrounding kernel works.
    Is it in the stock kernel now ? If not, is it possible to get it?
Now the question arises what you mean by "stock kernel".
2.6.0-test3 is still in a sorry state.
I cannot insmod usb-storage.o for a vanilla 2.6.0-test3.
It hangs. (Have not checked yet whether this is a permanent hang
or one of these scsi_eh_X that spend hours resetting the bus and
trying again. I booted 33 min ago and it still hangs.)
I have not tried 2.4 recently, but that is supposedly stable.
If you need the CF half, you need no help from me, you must "just"
find some kernel where usb-storage and usb and scsi all work.
Maybe a recent 2.4 would do.
If you need the SM half, ask me again.

[Long ago I made some general common infrastructure for SM readers.
In May 2002 someone asked me for this stuff and I put something at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/aeb/usb-storage.tar.gz
Don't recall precisely what this is, or to what kernel it belonged,
in view of the date it may have been 2.5.13 or 2.5.14. But I see
there is an apacer.c, and the source looks healthy at first sight.]
