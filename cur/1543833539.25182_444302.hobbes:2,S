I'm still not quite happy about this; the entire point of the check is
that we CAN'T trust the ACPI implementation, and want a second opinion.
This patch basically asks the ACPI implementation if we can trust the
ACPI implementation. I'm not sure that's a good idea.
And I understood that most issues went away with the more relaxed check
that is in gregkh's tree already (if not in mainline, I should check
that).
