Yes, it does appear that I didn't have overclocking setup properly, my
CPU demanded 2.3v power to run properly at 450mhz.  But for the sake of
being complete in my efforts to debug this problem I have found this
(and these notes stand for ALL speeds, 300mhz 2.0v core, 450mhz 2.3v
core, etc., I have spent about 3 hours testing them): every time that I
boot Linux from the harddrive it fails.  Don't ask me why, I don't
know.  I am currently running a 2.2.2 kernel (stock, no patches) that I
made a bootfloppy from.  When I boot off of the floppy EVERYTHING works
fine (except my cablemodem, but that's a driver problem).  EIDE checks
run dandy, everyone is happy.  However, the SAME kernel, when installed
on the harddrive (make install on the kernel) fails at the partition
check.  The floppy copy does NOT ever fail, the kernel loads (slow, as
floppies are that way), then it just cranks right on through normal
startup procedures.
Below is the message (took forever to write this damn thing down) that
all of the 2.2 kernels give me when I boot them from my HD, the screen
goes like this (none of this occurs w/ a bootfloppy ver of the same
kernel):

And that that point I must reboot.  The biggest kicker is the face the
EXACT SAME image, when booting the EXACT same way when loaded from a
floppy works!  It goes right through w/o any errors at all.  I find this
rather odd.  This behavior is identical at all speeds, overclocked or
not... I know the harddrives are good because I fsck'ed them and no
errors showed up.  Below is the output from the /proc/cpuinfo from 2.2.2
booted from a floppy (what I'm in right now), this is at 100mhz fsb and
450mhz CPU speed:

I am unsure how much that information on the screen will help you, but I
can assure everyone that that is exactly what happens (every time). 
I'll be happy to provide the kernel image if someone wants it.  If you
need any OTHER output from anything let me know and I'll be happy to
provide it.

I have also put this system through hard stress tests in both Windows
and Linux, and none of them have failed.  These tests included Gausian
Blurr radius 10 on a 100mb file (600dpi), rc5des clients, prime95 (and
mprime for Linux) for the torture test (ran overnight), played mp3's
while compiling kernels and such.  Everything I can think of to test the
system has come out just fine (and fast), so I am really leaning to the
fact there is a bug somewhere in LILO (if LILO could cause this) or the
kernel IDE code (since this occurs at all speeds, overclocked or not). 
And I know the CPU is not hot because the heatsync is always cool to the
touch (I have some monster heatsync to cool the CPU and 5 case fans).
