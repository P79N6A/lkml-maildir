It might generate better code to do
	unsigned long compound;
	compound = page->flags & (1 << PG_compound);
	if (PG_compound > PG_tail)
		return compound & (page->flags << (PG_compound - PG_tail));
	else
		return compound & (page->flags << (PG_tail - PG_compound));
ie: get the PG_compound flag into `compound', then bitwise-and that with
the PG_tail flag, after shifting it into PG_compound' slot.  The return
value will be zero if either bit is clear, (1<<PG_compound) if both are
set.  The `if (PG_compound > PG_tail)' will be swallowed by the compiler.
The compiler should turn it all into
	(page->flags & N) & (page->flags << M)
Which may or may not be better than (page->flags & N == N), dunno. 
Probably not - if the compiler's any good it won't save a branch, I
suspect.
Which is all a ton of fun, but this subversion of the architecture's
freedom to use volatile, memory barriers etc is a worry.  We do the same in
page_alloc.c, of course...
