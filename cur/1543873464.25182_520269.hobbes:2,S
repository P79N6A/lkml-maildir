Subject: [PATCH] ACPI_IBM_BAY can not coexist with ACPI_BAY

ACPI_IBM_BAY cannot coexist with ACPI_BAY --- it causes the IBM ACPI
code to fail to initialize so all the IBM ACPI functionality is
missing.  The simplest fix is to just make sure the Kconfig magic
disallows ACPI_IBM_BAY when ACPI_BAY is enabled.
