I just got it working over the weekend. The machine had an Adaptec 29320 
64-bit PCI card driving a SCSI HD. It was removed, and the drive 
replaced with a Serial ATA drive, and it came up fine.
There were probably a lot of variables that were changed by removing the 
card, but I'm wondering if anyone has experienced the same symptoms with 
any 64-bit PCI card installed on this board.
