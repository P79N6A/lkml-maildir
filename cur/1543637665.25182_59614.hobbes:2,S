   From a page cache standpoint softirq's are 100% equivalent to
   hardware irq's, so that doesn't much help here.
Wait are we trying to make the final freeing of (potentially)
LRU/page-cache pages from any non-base context illegal?
If that really becomes an issue we can do something which moves
this back to user context when the result of doing it in irq
context would be problematic.
