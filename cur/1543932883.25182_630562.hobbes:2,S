I did.
I said I would remove that string, because I don't want all that email,
either. It's a little past the middle of the post appended here.

Greg,
First, let me thank you for your prompt replies!

If you object, I will be happy to move them into the routine body
without the defines. I agree that It does look inconsistent to have
these strings defined and other strings embedded in the routine body.

Actually, no. The strings do not contain redundant info. The pr_info
routine is just a macro for printk(KERN_INFO ...)

Hmmm! Good point! I was actually copying that other message. I will
remove the string that advises posting a report. I sure don't want 'em,
and I can see that you don't, either.

The function call used to be contained in an if statement.
I changed the logic, but forgot to remove the extra parens.
It's tough getting old.

Oops Legace ... too much language confusion in my life ... portugues ...
italian ... oi ...
