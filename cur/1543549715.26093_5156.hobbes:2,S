It's safe alright, but if we want to do the generic_unplug_queue
instead of just hitting the request_fn (which might do anything
anyway), it would be nicer to expose this part of the block layer
(i.e. have a general way of queueing a request to the request_queue).
But I guess just
q->plug_device_fn(q, ...);
list_add(...)
generic_unplug_device(q);
would suffice in scsi_lib for now.
