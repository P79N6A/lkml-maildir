Hey cool. Now we've come to a point where we agree. If you want to do
serious accounting, iptables is not the subsystem of your choice.
As you've pointed out on your very enthusiastic homepage:
    * Mixing fundamentally different functionalities like security and
    * accounting in a firewall is not a good idea anyway. It leads to overly
    * complex firewall code (potentially thousands of rules just for
    * accounting) and unreliable accounting (f.e. when the firewall rules get
    * reloaded).

No, not at all. I'd like to help developing an RTFM meter for linux.
I guess we don't actually need to keep seperate flow information, but
could attach it to the netfilter connection tracking.
