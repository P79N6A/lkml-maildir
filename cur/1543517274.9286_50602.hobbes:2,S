Subject: transparent proxy problem with Linux 2.2.13

I'm having a weird problem with squid 2.2stable5.
I have it set up as a transparent proxy on a 2.2.13 box.
I'm using IP chains to redirect port 80 requests to the proxy on port
8080.
I have IP forwarding enabled and am using the following ipchains command
/sbin/ipchains -A input -j REDIRECT 8080 -p tcp -s 203.37.38.0/24 -d
0.0.0.0/0 80
The weird thing is that it works fine for about a day then stops
working.
No obvious error messages in logs.
The proxy still works if I contact it explicitly on the proxy port
rather than using the transparent functionality.
So networking is still working.
I get an error message back from the squid about "connection lifetime
exceeded". So the redirection is still working to some extent as the
request is reaching the squid.
I dont think its a squid problem as such as the same version works fine
under kernel 2.0.36.
And when the problem occurs, squid is still working.
So it seems to be some sort of interaction between the IP redirection
and squid.
A reboot fixes it, but stopping and restarting squid doesnt.
I'm trying 2.2.14pre9 at the moment to see if it fixes it.
I notice that the changes for for 2.2.14pre mentions a transproxy fix.
Does anyone know if that transproxy problem is likely to have these
symptoms.
Does anyone have any other suggestions as to what could be causing this.
