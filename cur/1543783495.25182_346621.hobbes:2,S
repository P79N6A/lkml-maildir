Oh, it's absolutely possible (even likely) that the application was slow 
between 11:34:54.337167 and 11:34:54.611769 and data kept accumulating in 
the socket buffer. The real problem is not the shrinking of the window, 
but the fact that it never increases back to normal once the socket buffer 
is emptied.

Not really: the tcpdump is taken on the very box that generates the acks 
with the shrinking window, so it can't possibly be affected by any shaper. 
Unless the shaper is the Linux kernel itself...
