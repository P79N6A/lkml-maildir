This is a characteristic of a VFS (Virtual File System) on any
Unix system. The file doesn't go away until it is closed by
everybody that accesses it. However, you can remove or rename it
even when it's open for write by other tasks. If a task has an
open file-descriptor and keeps it open, it could 'fix' a possibly
deleted file, by opening it again with
         new_fd = open("filename", O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0644);
(without O_TRUNC) and it will remain in existance after all
file descriptors are closed, because it was "created" again
after it was deleted by another task. However, if all descriptors
are closed before you recreate it, data are permanently lost.
In this case, it's a new file.

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
