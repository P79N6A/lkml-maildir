That should be fine (although I'm not sure what made you go this way :)
Please see my reply to Douglas, proposing an enum req_io_direction
at the block layer and up which will provide a better enumeration
for our use.

much better. thanks!

The idea was to be resilient to invalid values. (dir != DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL)
is fine of course, but I'd add a BUG_ON such as (dir < 0 || dir > DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL)
