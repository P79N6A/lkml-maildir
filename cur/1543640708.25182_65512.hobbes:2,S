Well its definitely a kernel bug. We should never crash given a bad CD.
In this case I think the problem is a little deeper. Our efs code
doesn't appear to consider and error the case when its block size is 
below 2048 bytes.
An EFS block is 512 bytes so we tell a 2K sectored device to use 512byte
sectors. At this point the kernel rightfully realises that something
deeply wrong is happening and aborted.
I believe the fix is as follows
	Make EFS check its not asking for stupid block sizes
You can then use a loopback mount to buffer the device and mount the CD
that way. I'll fix the EFS code tomorrow
