Oh.   Maybe we should put a big fat printk in slab for that.

Probably a panic() in your topology_init().
Also the below patch should have been done ages ago.

Well yeah, except I find that patch to be independently malodorous ;)

See below.

Yeah, it's dead.

We presently ignore the return values from initcalls.  But that can carry
useful debugging information.  So print it out if it's non-zero.
Also make that warning message more friendly by printing the name of the
initcall function.
