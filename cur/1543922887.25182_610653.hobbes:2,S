Seems fine, at a first look. You moved the device structure into the
object where it belongs, instead of allocating one, and saving the
pointer. You should really considering changing the core to do the
free()ing of your object with the embedded devices release function,
that is called when the last reference to the object is gone, instead of
"hoping the best". :) But if the drm core does that properly, it might
work, sure.
The open coded: device_create_file(&dev->dev, &device_attrs[i]) should
probably replaced by passing the array to the class, and the core will
do that for you. 
Do you assign the dev_t: MKDEV(DRM_MAJOR, head->minor) somewhere? You
need to put it in dev->devt, if you want a device node created by
userspace.

You should use the same value as the old code:
  &(head->dev->pdev)->dev
and assign it as the parent, seems right..

Keep it, you want to express the relationship in sysfs, so that a
"device" link is created, or that the device directory lives as a child
below the parent device. Seems fine so far.

Hehe, that's always a solution. :)
