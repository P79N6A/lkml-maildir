Duh.  There is one other possible solution I forgot to mention and
at least as a first pass it should be relatively simple.  Have the
mount of proc capture the network namespace.  I'm not certain
if it is what we want long term but it should be simple and relatively
easy to implement.
I don't like capturing the network namespace when we mount proc but
it is easier then implementing /proc/self/net.  Which is the other
real alternative.
