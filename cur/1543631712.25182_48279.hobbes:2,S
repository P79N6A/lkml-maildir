I'm not denying that there are clients who will still choose to pay
FSMLabs. But they're a staff of less than 10, so that's not very indicative
of anything else than minor market interest for the technology.
As for Lineo, they've been in financial trouble for some time, so their
situation is rather telling.

Developers will simply not come out in the cold and say we chose OS xyz
instead of Linux because of the rtlinux issues. But talk to them in
private and then you get an entirely different picture.
One sympton of the current situation is the recent study by the VDC
which I alluded to earlier:
http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT6328992055.html
When asked what the #1 factor inhibiting the use of Linux, developers
answered "real-time limitations".
This speaks for itself.
