Paul's patch looks better to me than renaming one of them.
And the predicate name on ia64 now seems confusing, at least to me.
And EFI for x86_64 is being worked on, so it will either
use arch/i386/kernel/efi.c or duplicate lots of it.
Summary:  There needs to be a place to share this and possibly other
common functions.
