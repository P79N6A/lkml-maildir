Not quite, unfortunately. Just some strange thoughts at times, that's
about it. 
So far the quality of the electricity network here is quite in order, if
not perfect. But since it's all about money these days, that quality
will drop sooner or later. Until that time has come I'd better be in a
position to afford the UPS and the space to tuck it in. Anyway, all this
self-made consideration is more out of interest. In case I'd actually go
into production, I know a few guys I can ask in advance whether what I
want to do is entirely insane or actually worth thinking over in terms
of a fun-to-do project.
Kind regards,
Chris
