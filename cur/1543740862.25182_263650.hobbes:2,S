Hi Roland,
 Thanks for answering my mistaken impressions.  I saw after I wrote that
SIGEV_SIGNAL == 0 which makes everything work.  And I was laboring under
the misconception that SIGEV_SIGNAL and SIGEV_THREAD were mutually exclusive
which isn't true, one always has SIGEV_SIGNAL if SIGEV_THREAD is set.
Regards,
Joe
