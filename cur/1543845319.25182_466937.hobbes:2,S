Subject: [PATCH] PCI domains Kconfig entry
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is obviously a missing patch...
With this patch, my Marvell SATA on the second root PCI bus of my 
HP xw9300 workstation works.  Without the PCI domain support, the
Marvell SATA is completely invisible to the kernel.
