Including include/usb.h from a external module source (out of the kernel tree) causes 
this:
In file included from /home/diego/kernel/unsta/include/linux/irq.h:19,
                 from /home/diego/kernel/unsta/include/asm/hardirq.h:6,
                 from /home/diego/kernel/unsta/include/linux/interrupt.h:9,
                 from /home/diego/kernel/unsta/include/linux/usb.h:15, <- file included
                 from w9968cf.h:38,
                 from w9968cf.c:57:
/home/diego/kernel/unsta/include/asm/irq.h:16:25: irq_vectors.h: No such file or directory
However in include/asm/irq.h you can see:
#include <linux/config.h>
#include <linux/sched.h>
/* include comes from machine specific directory */
#include "irq_vectors.h"
so who is wrong here? This include cames out
of the specific machine directory; but it doesnt
seems a wrong include.
irq_vectors.h is at: include/asm-i386/mach-default/irq_vectors.h
