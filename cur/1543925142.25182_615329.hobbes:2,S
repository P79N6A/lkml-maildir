Damn, I shouldn't have only grep'ed under drivers/.
@davem:
Please look at net/ipv4/arp.c:arp_process()
Am I right that CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET=n and CONFIG_NETDEV_1000=y or 
CONFIG_NETDEV_10000=y will not be handled correctly there?
And the best solution is to nuke all #ifdef's in this function and make 
the code unconditionally available?
