But 'as' has had no real changes in about 9 months time, it's really
strange. Twiddling with write expire and write batch expire settings
make no real difference. Upping the ante to 4 clients, two readers and
two writers work about the same: 27MiB/sec aggregate read bandwidth,
~100KiB/sec write.
At least something needs to be done about it. I don't know what kernel
this is a regression against, but at least it means that current 2.6
with its default io scheduler has basically zero write performance in
presence of reads.
