/var/log/ksymoops.  I added the code and documented it nicely, man
insmod or ksymoops.  It's not my fault if nobody reads the docs!

It would be better if klogd got out of the way completely.  Everything
is stored, just created /var/log/ksymoops.

IMNSHO the profiler should use kallsyms.  Then it gets every symbol
from the kernel and from all modules, instead of only being able to
report on exported symbols.
int kallsyms_address_to_symbol(
        unsigned long     address,      /* Address to lookup */
        const char      **mod_name,     /* Set to module name */
        unsigned long    *mod_start,    /* Set to start address of module */
        unsigned long    *mod_end,      /* Set to end address of module */
        const char      **sec_name,     /* Set to section name */
        unsigned long    *sec_start,    /* Set to start address of section */
        unsigned long    *sec_end,      /* Set to end address of section */
        const char      **sym_name,     /* Set to full symbol name */
        unsigned long    *sym_start,    /* Set to start address of symbol */
        unsigned long    *sym_end       /* Set to end address of symbol */
        )
We have the technology.
