No, it doesn't look like those helper functions are designed to handle this.
I'm really not the person to be asking about this.  I can poke around in
arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sparc.c:arch_get_unmapped_area() as well as the
next guy, and it seems to be doing the right thing for MAP_FIXED, but
how/whether it handles !MAP_FIXED I do not know.  Ask davem ;)
