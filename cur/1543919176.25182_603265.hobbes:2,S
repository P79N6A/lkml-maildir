It's hard to say without more info about what's going on.  It
might be on a non-enumeraton code path -- where nothing expects
to set the OWNER bit -- or the CONNECT bit might not be set.
See host/ehci-hub.c for details about exactly what the EHCI parts
are doing, and core/hub.c for how it's driven.
(It can be tricky to make sense of all that, easier if debugging
messages are turned on.   But that changes timings.  Better yet
would be being non-intrusive tracing of the actual code paths
that the CPU follows.)

If the UHCI driver got disconnect and reconnect notifications,
I expect it would do so.  At least OHCI seems *not* to have gotten
such notifications.  I'm speculating that the "just a switch"
behavior for the CF (and OWNER) bits may not allow notifications
like that to happen when the companion controllers are resetting.
