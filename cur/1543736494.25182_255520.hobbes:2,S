I do not know if I'm more scared of swsusp1 to kill order-8
allocations or if suspend2's two page sets scare me more. (Hooks
suspend2 needs to stop all page cache activity are scary...)
I certainly want some parts of suspend2 (like improved freezer, if it
can be made small enough), but I'm no longer sure I want all of it. I
expected many people complaining about highmem problems in swsusp1,
and that just did not happen; SMP support turned out to be reasonably
simple...
