I've not been able to get NTP working on some of my RH7.2 and RHAS2.1 systems.
Absolutely no TCP or UDP traffic shows in a tcpdump.  The command ntpdate gives me this
and nothing more:
15 Jan 10:06:59 ntpdate[22868]: poll(): nfound = 0, error: Success
I was intially thinking that this was a glibc-i386 vs glibc-i686 problem, but
it does not appears so after more research.
I decided to run lsof, and get the following whenver ntpdate fails (doesn't
send out any traffic at all when looking via tcpdump).  Note
the last line where I get "can't indentify protocol".
[root@server]# lsof|grep ntpdate
ntpdate     461     root  cwd    DIR        8,7     4096    144002 /root

y protocol
I've checked the LSOF FAQ regarding this "can't indentify protocol", and I'm not
any further ahead.
I've not been able to reproduce this consistently, but when I shut down xinetd, ipchains,
and enter "ALL:ALL" in hosts.allow, *eventually* (but not consistently especially as 
far as a timeframe), eventually ntpdate works as expected.
Any ideas?
Marco
