Ok, I see your point, however, the problem is that at this stage, in
linux, you really can only set the dma mask on the pci device of the
ohci. That means that sbp2 will effectively change the ohci's DMA mask
for all OHCI operations...
Architectures like powerpc (and possibly others) need to track what
iommu/bridge/etc... a device is on for proper mapping and provide
different DMA operations for different busses. Thus, only devices that
have properly been "setup" by the architecture for DMA can use the DMA
operations.
So while ideally, sbp2 should set the dma mask on itself (or rather on
the sbp2 device) and then use that device for dma mapping operations,
this will not work.
Now, we could try to devise a generic API for use by things such as
ieee1394 to "make DMA'able" sub devices of a pci device with local dma
masks. At least for powerpc, it wouldn't be too hard, but other archs
might have issues if they do things like test for the bus_type.
Cheers,
Ben.
