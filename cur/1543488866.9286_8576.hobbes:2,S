Sorry if this was posted twice or thrice...
I have a problem with XDF disks.
After copying ~8 disk images to floppies using xdfcopy from fdutils-5.2, I
get the error:
read/write: Cannot allocate memory
The exact instruction was:
xdfcopy -n <image> /dev/fd0
This happens with the 2.0.x kernels. With 2.1.x or 2.2.x I get the
following syslog entry, and the error normally happens even earlier:
Cannot allocate DMA memory. Temporarily falling back on virtual DMA.
It is unacceptably slow then, and the data copied is complete nonsense.
When copying from floppy to hard disk, I also encounter problems
regularly.
I have tried this on 4 different x86 machines.
I used:
fdutils-5.2
glibc-2.0.7.something (from redhat 5.2) or glibc-2.1
kernel versions 2.0.33, 2.0.36, 2.2.0pre1-2.2.2
A 3.5" 1.44M disk drive
