I am fully agree with idea of one set of debug/info/warn/etc. macros.
My main point in prev. posting was to fix __FUNCTION__, for USB this 
seems to be easy doable since there is already subsystem-wide dbg() and 
alike macros. Actually, there is no sense for __FUNCTION__ to appear 
outside macros; in real code it provides no added value (except easy 
cut-n-paste from function to function).
