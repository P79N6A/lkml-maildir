This code definitely shouldn't rely on the format of the kdev_t structure. 
It looks like it should be something like:
-	kdev.value=(int)driverfs_dev->driver_data;
-	return off ? 0 : sprintf (page, "%x\n",kdev.value);
+	kdev = val_to_kdev((int)driverfs_dev->driver_data);
+	return off ? 0 : sprintf (page, "%x\n",kdev_val(kdev));

First off, you might want to specify that you are using a specific patch. 
The change of the first parameter of the show() and store() callbacks was 
in a patch I posted last week. As of a few seconds ago, it hadn't been 
merged into Linus' kernel.org tree. 
Second, the definition of the callbacks should change, and there should be
an appropriate cast in the function. I have patches for all the users of
those callbacks, but I'm waiting until I finally resolve the refcounting
issues and post and updated patch to post those. FWIW, the pointer passed
to those callbacks is guaranteed to be a struct device, so the warning is, 
for now, harmless. 
Finally, if you have driverfs questions/problems/concerns, please copy me 
(and not Richard). :)
