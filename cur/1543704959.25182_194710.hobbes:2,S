ntp.drift is -22.251 on linux-2.6.1. But on linux-2.4.24 it stabilizes at
about -5.4.

Yes, on linux-2.2.24 I can see that /proc/uptime is just the jiffies and
btime is current time - jiffies. But in linux-2.6.1 /proc/uptime is now
do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime(), whatever that means, and /proc/uptime
gives a correct value. But btime is still gettimeofday-jiffies and it does
not stay constant. My patch changed btime to be
gettimeofday-do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime() and after that it stays
constant.
In other words, on linux-2.2.24, if I print the current time with 'date +%s'
and subtract uptime (/proc/uptime) from that, I do get the same number that
is in the btime field in /proc/stat. But not on linux-2.6.1 without my
patch. (ntp running in both cases.)

I guess it's not. The relative error was just the same in both. On
linux-2.2.24, ps start time is correct but on linux-2.6.1 it shows times in
future. How much in future, about minute per four days of uptime. But if I
multiply Hertz by e.g. 1.000172 in the ps source, then I get the right
results on linux-2.6.1.
I'll do an experiment and boot to linux-2.6.1 without ntpd next...
Thanks,
