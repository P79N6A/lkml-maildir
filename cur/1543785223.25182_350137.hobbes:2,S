It should ignore the lun value for REPORT LUNS.

What I mean is that the target has to intercept the command whether it is
a REPORT LUN or for the well known (W_LUN).
The target (firmware) code has to have code today like:
	if (cmd == REPORT_LUN) {
		do_report_lun();
	}
For only W_LUN support, the code might be something like:
	if (lun == W_LUN) {
		if (cmd == REPORT_LUN) {
			do_report_lun();
		}
	}
But the first case above already covers even the W_LUN case.
So adding a W_LUN at this point does not add any value ... maybe it looks
nice in the spec and in someones firmware, but it does not add anything
that I can see.
Kind of like an 8 byte lun, it adds no meaningful functionallity. [I mean,
who would want 2^64 LUs on one target? Yeh, let's give everyone in the
world ... no in the universe their own private LUN on a single target. The
LUN hiearchy is a bad idea, I have not seen a device that supports it,
kind of like trying to implement network routing inside your storage box.
Don't let those storage or database experts design your network hardware.]
