I agree with your arguments.
I think it can be done with zero cost with some hacks and swapping
sk->dst_cache all the time. Let's see if I can get it too work without
too many changes. If not 2.2 will have to live with that problem.
In 2.3 a cleaner facility would be appreciated
(the internal interface could keep some overhaul anyways for NFS, currently
it does far too much copying and is rather inefficient)
