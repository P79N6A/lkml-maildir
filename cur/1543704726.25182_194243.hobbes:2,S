If yours works on ethernet please use yours. Mine didn't.

You reverted it back? 
What I did was to change all not really kgdb specific CONFIG_KGDB uses in
the main kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO (mostly CFI support). I don't feel
strongly about it, but this way there is no reference to an unknown
config symbol in mainline. Also DEBUG_INFO including CFI makes sense I think.
Putting the kgdb options into a separate sourced file is a good idea. 
This should decrease future conflicts.
