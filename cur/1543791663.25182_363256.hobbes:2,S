I don't know if I ever contributed code to the DVB subsystem which is
actually exported, but in case I did, then I am against changing the
affected EXPORT_SYMBOLs.
This would make it impossible to the use source code of most hardware
vendors for embedded products because they usually have different
licenses for their "run-on-every-embedded-platform-and-even-on-windows"
drivers.
Also I remember people telling on lkml that EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL was used
for new kernel internal code only and I can't see how this applies to
dvb-pll or any other part of the dvb subsystem which grew up outside the
kernel tree.
