I think you guys probably got used to it. Also, you
seldom build the whole thing, anymore, because the
dependencies are handled differently. I was used to
building stuff on 2.4.x. When I went to build stuff using
the new build procedure I was shocked. It was like the
old days with 66MHz '486s (fast) and 33MHz i386's. Of
course there weren't modules, then so 2hrs,30min
was normal. Now, with a CPU that's 80 times faster and
a front-side bus that's 12 time faster, and SCSI
disks that are 40 times faster, there just has to
be something wrong when a complete build of the kernel
takes an hour.
