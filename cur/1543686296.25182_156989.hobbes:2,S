Yeah, that would be cool to do.  2.7 :)

Yeah, I've wanted that for a while too.  Don't really know how to get
the compiler to do that though :(

Yeah, it was just a port from 2.4 which says:
	struct pci_device_id {
		unsigned int vendor, device;
		unsigned int subvendor, subdevice;
		unsigned int class, class_mask;
		unsigned long driver_data;
	};
We could probably change it now if you really want to.  Don't know if it
will save much space though.
