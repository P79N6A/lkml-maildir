ieee1394, sbp2 and all of the subsystem is in working order. What
problem are you having?
If all the files in drivers/ieee1394 are less than 30 bytes, I think you
have some other problem.
Also, 2.5.74 stock has a problem in sbp2.c. It needs the linux/pci.h
include added (already fixed in Linus' tree).
