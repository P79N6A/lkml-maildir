Overall looks pretty good, from a technical review perspective.
Two worries:
1) exporting ata_scsi_find_dev(), and assuming a scsi device is 
attached.  the latter can be fixed by a !NULL check (and should be), but 
its a bit of a layering violation since long term we want to make the 
SCSI simulator optional for all ATA devices.
2) vaguely related to #1, I'm not so sure the attributes should be 
implemented directly in ahci.  if this __or something like it__ appears 
on non-Intel hardware, the code should be somewhere more generic.
