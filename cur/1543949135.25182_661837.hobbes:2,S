Hi,
There was a thread about MODULE_MAINTAINER but how about a tag which
a) would be present in source files, not necessarily one per module
c) would be machine-parseable
d) would have _no_ effect on object code (i.e., would be ignored by
   the compiler completely)?
I guess it would be more useful than current MAINTAINERS file and we
would at last know immediately what to put in "To:" line.
Another idea? Why don't we move all the kernel-related lists to
vger.kernel.org, making them "open" in the process?
Want more? :-)
