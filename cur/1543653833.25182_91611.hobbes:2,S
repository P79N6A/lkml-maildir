Yes, My C1VE Vaio works well with the latest ACPI.

Great. I've tested it and it works great here (I've modified sonypi
to use ec_read/write instead of the homebrew replacements). Feel free
to push the patch to Linus and I'll submit my modifications after that
(I have a quite large update pending for the sonypi driver, so I'll
submit all this probably this weekend).

I have no problem with that.

Well, not directly related to the EC thing but rather to the ACPI/sonypi
integration, but maybe you noticed that the sonypi driver also
re-implements some code which is originally defined in the ACPI bios
(SRS, DIS methods on "SPIC" ACPI object). 
One day I should really call some ACPI exported function to do this,
but last time I looked at this (3 months ago ?), the ACPI API (the one
exported to external users) was still changing each day. 
Have things improved in this area ? 
Stelian.
