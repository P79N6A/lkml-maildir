Why does'nt linus keep his sources in a cvs tree
so the rest of the folks can read it from there ?
he can still have the write access to the tree
exclusively.
We can keep patches in some kind of database as well
so they dont get lost, linus can mark them rejected/applied
e.t.c e.t.c.
Just thinking aloud.
