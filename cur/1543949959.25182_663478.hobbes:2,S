One of them is tests.git's lib/Kconfig.debug.  linux1394-2.6.git's 
commit 523a65f1a7a339e528ca6d6d808516fe195fde03 apparently is the one 
causing it.
Stephen, should one of me and Sam adjust his -next branch?  (This kind 
of conflict will be trivially avoided in the merge window; so resolving 
it now would mainly mean one manual(?) step less for Stephen.)
