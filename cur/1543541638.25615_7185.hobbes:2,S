Traceroute uses UDP by default.  Even if anything is filtered, then the
packets should stop there with some form of traceroute error such as:
!N !H, etc...
It is going all the way to 255 ttl though.  Funny thing is I got on
microsoft last night on Sympatico DSL, but it won't work from dialup
modem, or from meteng.on.ca.
Important note here though for those tuning in late, microsoft is being
used as a "this site is unlikely to be disconnected from the net" test due
to half the internet appearing to have vanished.

Yeah, I've confirmed now that no quake is responsible.  There is
definitely something going wrong.  Maybe someone has a foobar IDS setup
with portsentry somewhere...  I dunno but half the west coast has
disappeared from my area, and many other areas as well.  I hope /. posts
something about network outages soon because nobody out there seems to
know what is going on.
