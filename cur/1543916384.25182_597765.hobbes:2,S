Curiously the lockup problem disappeared after upgrading to 2.6.23-rc6-mm1.
(need to watch it in a longer time window).
Anyway here's the output of your patch:
        sb_locked 0
        sb_empty 97011

Still true. Another problem is that balance_dirty_pages() is being called even
when there are only 54 dirty pages. That could slow down writers unnecessarily.
balance_dirty_pages() should not be entered at all with small nr_dirty.
