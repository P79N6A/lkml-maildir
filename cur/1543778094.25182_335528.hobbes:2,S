hello
i would like to ask if it possible to change the optimization of the 
kernel from -O2 to -O3 :D, how can i do that? if i change it to the top 
level Makefile does it change to all the Makefiles?
And let's say that i change it... does this generate any problems with 
the space that the kernel will take? (the kernel will be much larger)
Thanks
Chris
