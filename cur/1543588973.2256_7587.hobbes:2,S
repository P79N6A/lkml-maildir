You use UDMA33 dor your second drive and MWDMA16 for your first.
Check your BIOS UDMA enable settings.

Yes, it supports modes only up to 66 MB/sec.

26 megabytes per second is quite surprising in your setup

You can disable the VIA driver.

Check your BIOS settings, if you have disabled UDMA in the BIOS, the
driver can't detect the cable. If that doesn't work, use "ide0=ata66"
on the kernel command line.
