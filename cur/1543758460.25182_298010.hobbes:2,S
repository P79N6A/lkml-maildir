I expect most of them, yes. It is not a guarantee, cause drivers can and will
create attributes at any time. :) But the most interesting default ones, that
people tend to expect at event time will be there _before_ the event happens.
To get this for the whole system and not only the class+block core, a few remainig
places that use kobject_register() need to be changed to use kobject_add(), but
that is a trivial change and nice too, cause it cleans up some error pathes, where
a device needs to be unregistered in the same function and it emits two completely
useless events for that.

Yes, that was the motivation to do this. With all the hotplug env vars
we have now, we can throw out all the compiled-in lists and if some crazy
devices still need to wait, we can add something to udev's rule logic, that a
configured rule will wait for that file to show up.
Thanks,
