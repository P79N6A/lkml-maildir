Booting into /sbin/init -b indeed shows I get 33.3MB/s from hdparm,
 as in FC3. DMA is (again according to hdparm) udma4 both booted
 normally and in emergency mode. Note that at this point I'm testing
 2.6.17-rc1-git4 in FC5, not to be trailing current kernels too much
 (and yes, I already tested that normal 2.6.17-rc1-git4 boot in FC5
 gets 18.5MB/s - without IDE_GENERIC, so that is also clearly a
 non relevant factor).
As per Bill Davidsen's question in another email, blockdev --getra
 shows 256, which is the same value that hdparm shows.
