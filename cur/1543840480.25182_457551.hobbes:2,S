This is solvable with good help texts.
	config IOSCHED_PRON
	tristate
	  The pr0n I/O scheduler is specifically tuned for one specific
	  task -- busy webserver shipping pr0n to customers. Distributions of
	  file sizes and access patterns were heavily analyzed during
	  development.
	  To make such server even more faster also select "pr0n filesystem
	  support" in File systems menu and read help text there.
	  If you aren't in pr0n industry, say N.
