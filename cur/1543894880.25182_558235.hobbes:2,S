As long as there is only one person using the file system.  Rolling back 
the entire filesystem may work well for you, but screw up something else 
someone else is doing.
And what kind of rights do you have to assign to the user to do that level 
of snapshot and rollback?  You have to assume that there are more than one 
user and that they have less than root privileges.
