It's the expected behavior for a task-based model like Linux.  Each task is
independent and inherits the uid/gid from whoever called clone().  It's
just one of several resources that are specified as process-wide in POSIX,
but are per-task in Linux.
I've been working on a patch to allow clone() to specify shared
credentials, but it's been on the back burner.
