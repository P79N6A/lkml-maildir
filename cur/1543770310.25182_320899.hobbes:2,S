Why does the GitWeb interface lack a link to have a patch saved as a
text file?  Cutting and pasting isn't working for me with this patch. 
Also, saving the webpage as text from Firefox 1.0.4 also fails to give
me a working patch.
I get this patch error:
patching file drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_devintf.c
patch: **** malformed patch at line 4: " interface. Other values will
set the major device number"
What's up with this?
Thanks,
            MIles
