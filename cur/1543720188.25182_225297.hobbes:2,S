So what I wonder about is why anybody does something like this in the 
first place?
Any IEEE format architecture will make 0.0 be all-zeroes, last I saw. In
fact, any architecture (IEEE or not) where that isn't true will have
serious problems with floating point values in bss (hint: the bss isn't
initialzed to 0.0, it's initialized to the bit pattern 0).
So what the above boils dow to is a very very strange way of writing
	return 0;
and it has absolutely _zero_ to do with "little-endian" or anything else 
for that matter.
