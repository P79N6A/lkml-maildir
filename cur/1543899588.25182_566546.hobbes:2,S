Subject: technically, profile/oprofile Kconfig stuff is set up incorrectly

  as a short follow up to my previous patches, it might be worth
pointing out that profiling in general is defined improperly WRT
Kconfig, since *general* profiling is defined inside the more specific
Kconfig files for *oprofiling*:
  $ ls arch/*/oprofile/Kconfig
  that makes no sense, as it leads to incorrect Kconfig files like
arch/blackfin/oprofile/Kconfig:
=============================
menu "Profiling support"
depends on EXPERIMENTAL
config PROFILING
        bool "Profiling support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        help
          Say Y here to enable the extended profiling support mechanisms used
          by profilers such as OProfile.
config OPROFILE
        tristate "OProfile system profiling (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on PROFILING
        help
          OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
          whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
          and applications.
          If unsure, say N.
config HARDWARE_PM
        tristate "Hardware Performance Monitor Profiling"
        depends on PROFILING
        help
          take use of hardware performance monitor to profiling the kernel
          and application.
          If unsure, say N.
endmenu
==========================
where non-oprofile content (HARDWARE_PM) is now defined within the
oprofile subdirectory.
  the whole selection of profiling really should be moved up a level,
with oprofile content as a subdirectory, or something similar.
