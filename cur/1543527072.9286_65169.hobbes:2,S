Somehow a tasklet can be mysteriously dropped from the tasklet queue list.  
Tests were done in 2.3.47 SMP but the effects are felt back to 2.3.43 SMP.
I put some debugging messages into tasklet_hi_schedule (in this case
called from mark_bh).  With very frequent calls to tasklet scheduling a
task may be marked TASKLET_STATE_SCHED but disappear from the tasklet
queue before ever being launched.  It remains stuck in that condition.  I
attached an else to the test_and_set_bit condition test in
tasklet_hi_schedule and had the function search the list for the status of
the task.  I'll keep looking for the source of the problem, but I don't
know too much about the locking mechanisms so I'm not likely to get there
very fast.  Does anyone have any comments on this?
I get these from my code even after several seconds of letting the module
keep trying to mark_bh(IMMEDIATE_BH) and wait.  9 out of 10 times the
tasklet never runs, and the other time it only runs once or twice.
