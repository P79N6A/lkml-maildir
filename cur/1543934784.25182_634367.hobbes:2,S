In my experience checkpatch has a lot of false positives. e.g. when 
I run it over my pile 20+% of the warnings are just bogus. And in
a lot of other cases it is that the rules of thumbs it applies
do not apply to that specific case. 
e.g. example: when you have self test debugging code it is perfectly
fine to not use KERN_*

It's not -- checkpatch is often wrong.

You mean the one from Ingo with the random new lines? @) Perhaps.
I just ask that people use some common sense.

That's a problem of your vi. I'm sure it can be turned off.
Fortunately it's easily fixed.

I wrote one now.

As you can see it was trivial.
> No-one should submit patches with white-space errors - thank you.
No I disagree. If white space is suddenly that important -- it is still
unclear to me why that should be -- then the right way to handle that is 
at the maintainer level while merging patches. But rejecting patches
for reasons that a trivial script can fix up is just unnecessary friction
in the merging process and unnecessary bureaucracy.
Unnecessary bureaucracy defined as in rituals that do not 
actually improve any code or prevent bugs (or even style). I must say I find 
it a little sad that Linux is dissolving into that now. Ok perhaps
it is the eventual fate of anything that has been around for quite a long time,
but it seems to get worse much quicker recently.
Anyways I have the script above included now here in my patch setup
scripts so future patches of mine will have tabs.
But the problem with your "rule" is that every of the hundreds
of Linux kernel contributors will need to do the same. And that's just 
ineffecient, waste of valuable human work and just doesn't make much sense.
It certainly won't improve Linux in any way.
