   However, what I don't see to get at is the usercontext/ucontext
   structure containing register contents and so on, which as far as I am
   aware should be in the third (data) argument to the sa_sigaction-type
   sighandler; that's where I'm getting my problems.
The "register contents and so on" are in the sigcontext.
We don't use ucontext on sparc32.
Franks a lot,
