I've downloaded it, and I don't see a panic on that fs at all.
I've got it sitting in a tight loop mounting and unmounting the
image you sent me, and nothing has gone wrong. I don't think it's
a corrupted filesystem problem - it seems more like a memory corruption
problem to me.
What arch are you running on and what compiler are you using?
Can you try 2.6.18-rc6 and see if it panics like this on your
machine? there is little difference in xfs between -rc6 and -rc6-mm2
so it would be good to know if this is a problem isolated to
the -mm tree or not....
Cheers,
Dave.
