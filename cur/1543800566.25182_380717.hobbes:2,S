We provide the standard OpenIB mechanisms for doing that, of course.
However, our driver is layered.  The OpenIB layer uses facilities
provided by the main driver (via ipath_layer.c).  The main driver can
stand alone, without the OpenIB code compiled into the kernel or
available as a module at all.  In that case, a userland subnet
management agent must still be able to send and receive management
packets.

While we can split the main driver source file up along those lines, we
are not planning to make the ipath protocol optional.  We are planning
to submit another non-OpenIB network driver that depends on the ipath
protocol support.
