Miquel> Use /dev/urandom
If /dev/random is blocking indefinitely w/o keyboard or mouse
interupts, then /dev/urandom is not going to provide any entropy
either.  It won't block; it will provide data.  But what is the point
if there is no entropy in it?
The only solution to the problem is to find out why only kb and mouse
ints are adding entropy to the pool and to fix that so network and
disk ints do as well.  Or to use another source of entropy, such as a
card with a hardware rng (thermal noise, or whatever).
Something like audio_entropyd is another possibility, although that is
still labeled as experimental, not for production use....
