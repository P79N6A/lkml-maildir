Fixed.

That's why I have to retry reading data for at most 400ms otherwise
the chip will start a new ADC conversion.
I can replace mdelay(1) with schedule_timeout(HZ/1000) but doing this
I'm not sure that just 1ms has elapesed. Also the chip has no irq
lines to use for that.

Fixed.

I agree with them. :)

Fixed.
I'm going to repost the patch after some tests.
