Why don't you try my patches ontop and thin see what happens.
Then you are claiming heavy loads.
Go grab the smart-suite off of source-forge and see if you crapped out the
drives.

Yes and if you do not use the latest drivers that are backported, you can
not recover.

This is the following problem
hda: Maxtor 71626 AP, 1554MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=789/64/63, DMA
hdb: Maxtor 91021U2, 9641MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=1229/255/63, (U)DMA
hdc: Maxtor 91021U2, 9641MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=19590/16/63, (U)DMA
We do not set the master drive to be the slower one.
DMA mode 2 and UDMA mode 2 on a via core in master/slave order can get
flaky.

Dude if your drives are toast because of what I did and not the stock
kernel, I will besure that the OEM replaces them.
If you have junk hardware and under an powered system and high loads cause
the spindle to slow, this is a problem that was created by not match you
hardware power needs.

Do they do DMA correctly?
2.0.38 does not handle heavy IO like a patched 2.2 or 2.4, because it
can't.
