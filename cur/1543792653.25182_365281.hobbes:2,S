Here is code that actually works. There have been some kernel
API changes that convert some of this stuff to macros. Nevertheless.
This stuff works.
void make_daemon(const char *dev, int32_t prior)
{
#ifdef OLD_DAEMON              // kernel 2.4.x
     exit_files(current);
     daemonize();
     spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
     sigemptyset(&current->blocked);
     sigdelset(&current->blocked, SIGTERM);
     recalc_sigpending(current);
     spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
     task_lock(current);
     current->nice = prior;
     strcpy(current->comm, dev);
     task_unlock(current);
#else				// kernel 2.6.x
     daemonize("%s", dev);
     allow_signal(SIGTERM);
     set_user_nice(current, prior);
#endif
//
//  Destroy process privs just in case somebody is able to hack this
//  into a shell.
//
     task_lock(current);
     current->uid  = current->gid  = current->sgid = current->fsgid =
     current->euid = current->egid = current->suid = current->fsuid = 666;
     task_unlock(current);
}
Note above that the task is already running inside the kernel and
has access to all your data. You don't need it to be 'root' so that
possible back-door gets closed.

//
//    This is the kernel thread. It handles things that should not
//    be handled in an interrupt. It is awakened from the interrupt
//    service routine.
//
static int32_t local_thread(void *unused)
{
     make_daemon(task_name, PRIOR);
     set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);	// For the following sleep
     schedule_timeout(1);                        // Let insmod complete
     set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);		// Remember to restore
     __asm__ __volatile__("thread:\n.global thread\n");
     for(;;)				// Do forever.......
     {
         set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
         if(signal_pending(current))
             complete_and_exit(&info->quit, 0);	// This is how you get out
         interruptible_sleep_on(&info->twait);	// Sleep until something to do
         set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
         do_stuff(.....);    // Whatever the thread needs to do....
     }
     return 0;
}
  This is how the kernel thread is started.
     info->pid = kernel_thread(local_thread, NULL, CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES);
This is how the kernel thread is stopped.
     if(info->pid)
     {
         (void)kill_proc(info->pid, SIGTERM, 1);
         wait_for_completion(&info->quit);
     }
Cheers,
