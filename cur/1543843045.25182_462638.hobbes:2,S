Ok, as a quick answer, you have a very primitive VIA SMP board, which
make me remember my old laptop. 
I maintain what a had write in previous emails about this system. 
Seeing the configuration of irqs on windows, USB are in 9, so could be a
clue.
If I had your board, I'll try not quirk USB (cause quirk put USB in 11)
and make USB interrupts work as IO-APIC-edge.
9:       nnnn       nnnn   IO-APIC-edge  uhci_hcd:usb1, uhci_hcd:usb2,
uhci_hcd:usb3
