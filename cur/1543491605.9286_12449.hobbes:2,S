The expression is not valid C. It parses as
x = ((y ? (x = 1) : x) = 2);
Which of course is illegal.
After adding disambiguating parentheses, the expression is syntactically correct,
but its effect is undefined: you cannot change the variable being assigned to in
the expression on the right side of the assignment.
Think i = i++;
btw, this would really be more suited to comp.lang.c
