Well, I found some documentation in Documentation/pm.txt.  It refers to a
web site 
http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/
 which contains a Debian package
acpitools_0.0.20000216_i386.deb.  That package contains acpid, as well
as a script in /etc/init.d, but the script does not start up acpid.
Instead, it checks for /usr/sbin/acpipold, which the package does not
contain.
I tried starting up acpid, but it didn't stay running.  There is no
man page, so I tried ``acpid --help.''  It replied:
	acpid: unrecognized option `--help'
	Usage: acpid [-debug]
I typed ``acpid -debug'' and it replied:
	acpid: unrecognized option -- e
	Usage: acpid [-debug]
So I typed ``acpid -d'' and finally got:
	acpid: started
	acpid: FACP @ 0x01157980
	acpid: DSDT @ 0x00000000
	acpid: cannot map FACP
This was under 2.3.49.  When linux starts up, it prints:
	ACPI: found PIIX4 at 0x1000
I also tried acpid-030600.tar.gz.  There were no build instructions.
I tried typing "make", but it wouldn't compile.  When compiling
osdependent/linux/osd.c, it kept running into conflicts between
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/io.h and /usr/include/sys/io.h.
So I gave up on acpid and have now gone back to apm.
-------------------
In light of the above, I therefore offer the following patch:
Note that I am not an emacs user, so I did not use the required *.el
file for editing Documentation/Configure.help.
