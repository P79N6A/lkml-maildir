But with data journaling, there's a limited amount data pending that
needs to be sent to the log.  It isn't like the data pages in the
data=writeback, where there might be gigs and gigs worth of pages.  
Most data=journal setups are for synchronous writes, where the
transactions will be small, so sending things to the log won't take
long.

Well, I was trying to find a word for pages involved w/the journal and
failed ;-)  My only real point is we can add an async sync without
changing the way supers get processed.
It seems like a natural progression to start adding journal address
spaces to deal with this instead of extra stuff in the super code, where
locking and super flag semantics make things sticky.
