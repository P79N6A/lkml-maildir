Actually even the Intel support isn't particularly good. We don't have
proper mode setup code -- we have to invoke the BIOS to do mode setup,
and we can't set specific modelines (like PAL-compatible modes); we're
limited to what the BIOS knows about -- it's like vesafb with
acceleration.
There's some work on reverse-engineering the BIOS so that you can
hackishly poke 'new' modes into its tables, but it's still not a very
good option.
