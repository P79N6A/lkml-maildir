Subject: [PATCH] 2.4(/2.5?) clarify devfs documentation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The section of the devfs documentation which discusses the ability to
run a devfs-enabled kernel without devfs mounted is possibly confusing.
Hopefully this patch will make it easier to understand. It's against
2.4.20-pre3 but it applies to 2.4.19 and 2.5.31 as well.
For 2.4, please apply or explain any objections. If it's applied for
2.4, it would be good to apply it for 2.5 as well, although it might be
moot if devfs is killed during 2.5.

 Now you've finished all the steps required. You're now ready to boot
 your shiny new kernel. Enjoy.
