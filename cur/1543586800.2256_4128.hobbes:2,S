When I try to compile the linux 2.4.2 kernel I am
getting the following error:
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:30: Error: no such 386 instruction:
`ldmxcsr' 
It looks like an old assembler, but I am using
binutils 2.10 and have also tried binutils 2.10.1.  I
am using   egcs-2.91.66 as my compiler.
 
I am running Caldera OpenLinux 2.3, which uses
glibc-2.1.1-1, which I know is kind of an old version
and I am wondering if this could be the problem? Any
other ideas as to what could cause this? Thanks in
advance for any help or advice.
Laura
