Subject: [CFT 2/29] Add pci_bus_type probe and remove methods
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/5/152

Move the PCI bus device probe/remove methods to the bus_type
structure.  We leave the shutdown method alone since there
are compatibility issues with that.
Signed-off-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>
Greg: can we move the shutdown method, or are there still drivers
which need the special handling?
