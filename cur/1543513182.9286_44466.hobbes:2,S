I've known people who have gotten their car stereo stolen, and then seen
somebody else with it - but they couldn't 'prove' it was theirs (ie. they
didn't know their own serial numbers..)
Its quite likely this could happen with computers. Especially if a
company, say, wants to know the PIII ID. (they get broken into, a lot of
computers hit the black market, etc.)
