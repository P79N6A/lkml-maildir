Sounds like a good idea.  Originally, the "legacy_io" file was 
implemented this way because I knew of machines that couldn't properly 
handle it as a mmappable interface.  But when I pinged people about the 
resource files, I didn't hear anything, so they were just done with 
mmap.
But adding read/write is fine with me.  In fact, having read/write hooks 
for the memory backed resource files is also nice, since it makes 
dealing with them on the command line a bit easier.

Yeah, sounds like a good additional abstraction for that interface.  
Should make porting it to other arches easier (I talked with kyle about 
this last week, so maybe this'll give him motivation to do it for 
parisc).
