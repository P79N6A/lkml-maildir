bk pull bk://dtor.bkbits.net/input
01-synaptics-cleanup.patch
   Adjust the way we extract button data; do not announce BTN_BACK/BTN_FORWARD
   unless touchpad has SYN_CAP_FOUR_BUTTON; adjust querying extended
   capailities according to the latest Synaptics documentation addendum 
02-synaptics-middle-button.patch
   Support for touchpads that have middle button.
03-dont-change-max-proto.patch
   Do not mangle global parameter when probing for protocol extensions.
04-lkkbd-whitespace.patch
05-lkkbd-simplify.patch
   Drop some duplicate checks.
06-atkbd-soften-xfree-warning.patch
   Soften accusations against XFree when we get spurios ACK/NAK from the KBC. 
07-atkbd-trailing-whitespace.patch
08-atkbd-bitfields.patch
   Cleanup, convert some essentialy boolean fields ino bitfields.
09-atkbd-timeout-complaints.patch
   Do not complain about surious NAK in cases when keyboard controller's
   timeout is bigger then in atkbd and NAK to our probe comes too late. 
10-psmouse-rescan-on-hotplug.patch
   When we get 0xAA 0x00 froma device do reconnect and not rescan in case
   it's an old device that just reset for some reason (KVM switch?) 
11-psmouse-reconnect-after-error.patch
   Move psmouse_reconnectafter handling from synaptocs to psmouse-base so
   it can later be used by other protocols.
12-psmouse-protocol-handler.patch
   Add protocol_handler funtion pointer to the psmouse structure so we
   won't have unsighly if/switch constructs in psmouse-base when we add
   support for more protocols.
13-psmouse-sliced-command.patch
   Synaptics and logips2pp noth implemented their own routines of sening
   extended PS/2 commands to the mouse; consolidate the code.
14-atkbd-reconnect-probe.patch
   Do not alter psmouse structure when probing for supported protocols
   at reconnect. Cures an OOPS when Synaptics is not detected at first
   (USB legacy emulation problem, etc) but is detected after resume.
15-psaux-config.patch
   Allow disabling legacy psaux device even for non-embedded systems;
   not everyone wants/needs it.
