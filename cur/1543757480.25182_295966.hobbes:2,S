This all seems to be heading in the wrong direction.  Do we really want to
have lots of different system accounting packages all hooking into a
generic we-cant-decide-what-to-do-so-we-added-some-pointless-overhead
framework?
Can't we get _one_ accounting system in there, get it right, avoid the
framework?
