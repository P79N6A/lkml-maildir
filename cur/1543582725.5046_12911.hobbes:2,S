Hi!
The SoundBlaster driver havn't been working in any of the 2.4.x-releases if I
compile it into the kernel. However, it does work when compiled as a module. It
worked ok for me both compiled in and as a module under 2.2.x
I have sb=220,7,1,5 at the kernel commandline (the right values). The kernel
prints
Soundblaster audio driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
at boot, and nothing more.
TIA
