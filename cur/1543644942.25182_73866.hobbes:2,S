Yep, that's true if you build Netfilter into your kernel, not as Module(s). 
Build both, Netfilter + stuff and ipchains as modules and you are happy.
So you are able to use both (not at the same time for sure.
Just "modprobe ipchains" and use ipchains.
If you want to play with Netfilter, just "rmmod ipchains; modprobe ip_tables" 
and you can use iptables.
