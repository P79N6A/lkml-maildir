Maybe you don't, but some do.  Uses are rare, of course, but:

People building "cheap supercomputers" will be going that way
most definitely.  Slowest version is 2.5 Gbit/s, and most
common one appears to be running 4x that.
Another thing (for which I would have use at hand right away, actually)
is to have fully functional Fibre Channel subsystem in Linux along
with drivers to modern cards e.g. JNI's.  (2 Gbit/s FC)
Plugging tens of terabytes of disks on a box is somewhat challenging
without resorting to that technology...
I just don't have luxury of having a year or two to spend on
development of necessary things, I need to choose systems with
the support readily in place so I can load in my applications,
and start using them.  :-/
