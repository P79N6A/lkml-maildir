And the conditional jump is usually predicted correctly :-)

This part can probably be put in a proper non inline function.

What if something happens during the schedule() that would require
another thread...?
+}       
I have been discussing different layout with George on Montavista
also doing this kind of work... (different var and value range)
static incline void enable_preempt(void) {
    if (--current->preempt_count) {
        smp_mb(); /* not shure if needed... */
        preempt_schedule();
    }
}
in sched.c (some smp_mb might be needed here too...)
void preempt_schedule() {
    while (current->need_resched) {
        current->preempt->count++; /* prevent competition with IRQ code */
        if (current->need_resched)
            schedule();
        current->preempt_count--;
    }
}

It will NOT be fully, it will be mostly.
You will only context switch when a higher prio thread gets runnable, two 
ways:
1) external intterupt waking higher prio process, same context swithes as 
when running in user code. We won't get more interrupts.
2) wake up due to something we do. Not that many places, mostly due to
releasing syncronization objects (spinlocks does not count).
If this still is a problem, we can select to only preemt to processes running
RT stuff. SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR by letting them set need_resched to 2...

Remember to benchmark with stuff that will make the positive aspects visible 
too. Playing audio (with smaller buffers), more reliably burning CD ROMs,
less hichups while playing video [if run with higher prio...]
Plain throuput tests won't tell the whole story!

No, it won't help enough.
