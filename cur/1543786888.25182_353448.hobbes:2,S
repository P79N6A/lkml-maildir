+- autoconfiguration: "autorule" rule ["parameter"]
+  This defines the name of a rule, for choosing the
config automatically.
+  The purpose of a rule is to check the target-system
and tell whether 
+  the config can be chosen or not. A rule can be a
executable script, 
+  binary or whatever. They  must be insert in the
directory 
+  scripts/kconfig/rules/. Every rule has to give its
answer(y or n) 
+  out to the STDOUT. You can even define a Parameter
for your rule,
+  but it has to be quoted. 
+  Those rules will be respond by typing  "make
autoconfig" or
+  "make autochoiceconfig".
+  By "make autoconfig" all the elected-configs will
be choosen automatically 
+  as build-in.
+  By "make autochoiceconfig" the user will be asked
for choosing the elected-config.
