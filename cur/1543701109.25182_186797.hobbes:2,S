When doing things like this, can you split up the patches into two 
separate things: one that _only_ does whitespace changes, and that is 
guaranteed not to change anything else, and another that does the rest.
It's a total b*tch to try to figure out which change resulted in some 
difference, if the changes are intermixed with large whitespace cleanups.
