CKRM/RG handles this by eliminating the units from the interface and
abstracting them to be "shares". Each resource controller converts the
shares to its own units and handles properly. 
User can specify the quantities simply as a percentage. CPU controller
would treat it as cycles/ticks (within a time), memory controller would
treat it as number of pages, and I/O controller would treat it as
bandwidth, and so on...
