The much lamented POSIX spec (P1003.2c) used
-rw-r--r--+  1 helge    helge         140 Feb  9  1999 .bash_profile
          ^ note the plus sign
figuring that most shell scripts wouldn't pay much attention to
that particular position in the output. With the "A" scheme
suggested above you'd have trouble discriminating directories
and files.
POSIX specified a special program to see file ACLs. In Irix we
used "ls -D", because it was available. We rationalized the choice
by saying it stood for Descretionary Access Control. I personally
dislike commands with spelled out options, but then I grew up
using a TeleType, where every keystroke hurt.
