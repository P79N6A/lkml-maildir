Point.  I'd like that interface to specify that any undefined fields
should be zero, or we have a hopeless situation on our hands.
By the way, see the following for the structure definition; prepare to barf:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/hpa/linux-2.6-newsetup.git;a=blob;f=arch/i386/boot/boot.h;h=41a16f96ac3476cbd969aabe5e6a792ffe8c64a0;hb=HEAD
[I intend to move this into include/asm-i386/boot.h, but haven't gotten
that far yet.  I just yesterday got the code booting on both i386 and
x86-64, but haven't committed all the include/asm-* mods that went a
long with that yet.  I'm also waiting for a Kbuild fix so that the boot
directory can be shared between i386 and x86-64 without requiring a
symlink in the source tarball.]
