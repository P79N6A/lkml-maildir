"touch page tables" was inaccurate.  What I meant was that I do not
want any part of the page-table of the process to be invalidated
during a "common" read.  For instance, some "page flipping" direct I/O
implementations do not reuse the pages in the page table of the user
process, requiring parts of the page-table to be invalidated on a
read.

You mean there is no hardware that can do this? I hear SGI are
bragging about their advanced bus-snooping capabilities. I thought
they would be able to do this.  The data _is_ on a shared bus so it
should theoretically be available. If it really isn't possible, the
advantage of not invalidating page-table entries is less, but it is
still quite measurable.

Do you or anyone have a pointer to these patches?

What parts of the kernel is going to start using kiobufs? I looked
through the kernel and it looked like kiobufs were basically only used
by the raw devices.  How does kiobufs relate to for instance
bufferheads?
One more question: Will the raw devices be able to switch a high-mem
page into a dma-friendly page if the page is used as a buffer for a
direct I/O read?  I expect that on a high-mem machine, the kernel will
give out primarily high-mem pages to processes. It would be great if
the kernel could automatically "upgrade" high-mem pages that are used
as read buffers for raw I/O, to low-mem pages (<2G).
