The way you place __initdata is bogus.
Please read following from init.h again:
 * For initialized data:
 * You should insert __initdata between the variable name and equal
 * sign followed by value, e.g.:
 *
 * static int init_variable __initdata = 0;
 * static char linux_logo[] __initdata = { 0x32, 0x36, ... };
If gcc happes to accept your placement does not make it correct.
It is still bogus and unreadable.
