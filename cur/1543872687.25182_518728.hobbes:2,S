btw, looking at the code, we could just remove fs from the 
fs_gs_reload_needed and make in unconditional.  VT knows how to reload 
segments, except if they're user segments (groan).  In the case of fs, 
if it's used for the pda, it's obviously a kernel segment.
gs is different: since only the segment base is loaded (via swapgs), the 
selector part could well be a userspace selector, and thus the 
irq-protected reload is needed.
Anyway, I'm applying the patch as the above discourse is irrelevant to 
the fix.
