hi,
 I applied the S3 Frame Buffer patch against 2.3.2, it works great,
 I see my penguin logo!, but still can be improved like Solaris  
 (white bg and logo at the bottom and/or animated logo while
  loading). I  will try.
 You can get the patch from '
http://www.colonel-panic.com
'. This
 patch is against 2.2.9, you need to edit the patch file a bit.
 You may have to disable vgacon, it does't work for me with vgacon,
 I don't know why, though fb documents says 'it should work'.
 I am still trying to configure XF86_FbDev, can anyone point to me
 how to configure XF86Config file for fbdev. XF86_SVGA server works
 as normal under low FB resolution (< 800x600)
Brdgs
