Hi *
I have this card here, it is a S3-Based graphic card (S3 Trio64V+) and
a second card attached ("sandwich"), which is the video-Part of this
card.
I don´t have any handbook and/or CD-ROMs, I only can describe what I
see.
The Chips on the Tuner-Card are 
"ITT MSP 3400C-PS-C6 81-WGA-FA"
"ITT TPU 3040"
"ITT VPX3220A-PR-C4 59 WGA-FA"
Ports:
ANT in (directly to the Tuner)
S-Video in
Composite out
Line out (sound)
VGA-Out 
This seems to be an older Model of the miro-cards, the BIOS is:
"media View-PC Vers. 2.00 12.03.1996" (dd-mm-yyyy).
Does anyone know that card and do i have a chance to get it running
under Linux?
Greetings
Raphael Becker
