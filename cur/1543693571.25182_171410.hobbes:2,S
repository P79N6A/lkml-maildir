This compilation command line dos not look like it came from the kerel
build system? If indeed you're using your own build system, please use
the kernel's build system to compile external modules. See
Documentation/kbuild/* for details, as well as lwn.net's "Compling
External Modules" article - 
http://lwn.net/Articles/21823/.
 I'm
guessing that you do not have something set up properly that the
kernel's build system would've set up for you.
