That's what I was thinking too. If this is indeed the cause, the
dev_err() added by the debug patch I posted should trigger and we may
consider boosting the priority of the tasklet (using
tasklet_hi_schedule.)
Other solutions may involve trying to figure out what exactly is
blocking the tasklet from running. I have a patch series for the macb
driver that optimizes the RX processing a bit, but it obviously won't
help at91rm9200 since it uses a different driver...
