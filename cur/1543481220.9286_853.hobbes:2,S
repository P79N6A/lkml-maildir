in any distributed project like this, sometimes coding style is copied for
no good reason at all.
however, if a "goto" is used, perhaps some indication could be left in the
code about why it was used (fast-path optimization, pruning control
nesting, and so on) so future generations won't remove the critical ones. 
usually when one writes code using uncommon practices, a comment is
warranted to explain the obfuscation, but we could get very clever and use
C macros :)
