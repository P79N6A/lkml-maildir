could you just try this and send an as simple patch as possible? This is 
actually something that non-container people would be interested in as 
well. (btw., if this goes into 2.6.23 then we cannot possibly turn it 
off in 2.6.24, so it must be sane - but per UID task groups are 
certainly sane, the only question is how to configure the per-UID weight 
after bootup. [the default after-bootup should be something along the 
lines of 'same weight for all users, a bit more for root'.]) This would 
make it possible for users to test that thing. (it would also help 
X-heavy workloads.)
