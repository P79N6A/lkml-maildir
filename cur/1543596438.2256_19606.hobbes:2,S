Check your termination. The initio drivers are very sensitive to
termination errors (use active if possible), and make sure you follow all
the normal rules regarding scsi.
Most problems I've seen are caused by lousy termination, or using three
way busses. I've also seen some problems with some cd writers (Yamaha to
be exact), that I haven't been able to solve yet.
