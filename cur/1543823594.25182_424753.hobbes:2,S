A pci device can read system RAM and other memory-mapped PCI devices 
(such as display framebuffers) using DMA. In addition, a pci (but not 
pci-express) device can snoop on pci bus traffic to other devices. 
Typically, however, hard drive controllers will be integrated into the 
chipset so the data is not on the bus.
