Assuming a democratic state then the laws of the land ought to reflect the
'general will' (if you believe Rousseau anyway). They should thus define
the boundary ['derivative work' generally ] according to the general good
and with the consent of the people.

Does that question not suppose some positivist absolute morality ? I
suspect many would argue that it is moral to do so if the end goal of the
controls is moral. You might also want to apply the tests in Fuller's
