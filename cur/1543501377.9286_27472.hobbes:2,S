Hi,
I know Linux on i386 has a timer resolution of 10 ms, but
why I can't sleep for 10 ms, I can only sleep at
interval of  20 , 30, 40 ... ms.
This what happpends
usleep ( <= 10*1000)           will sleep for  20 ms
usleep ( <10*1000 <= 20*1000)  will sleep for  30 ms
usleep ( <20*1000 <= 30*1000)  will sleep for  40 ms
I'm runing 2.2.10.
Thanks.
Dong
