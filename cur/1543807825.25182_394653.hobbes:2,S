I gathered as much and that's why I preserved that behavior.
But it would be nice to know _which_ BIOS versions have that bug;
it's clearly a BIOS bug, and given the other problems we've seen,
it might be better to have that "turn on the SMI" be keyed by some
"real" quirk logic or kernel parameters.
(The fact that USB handoff is being driven by "quirk" logic, even
when it's not a quirk, also raises little warning flags...)

That's how it works now, but it didn't do that before.  Previously it
always turned on the SMI, and then never turned it off, causing issues
on various platforms.
Of course, the BIOS that Carlo is struggling with seems terminally
broken, and is blatantly ignoring the spec for how those handoff
flags are supposed to work.
