(Sort of OT) I realized that the PS/2 controller snagged a few of the upper
bits or something like that in the region that communicates with the keyboard. 
(Been a long time since I looked at this)  Is this the case on all
arches/platforms, for instance when the SPARC uses a PS/2 mouse does it use the
same sort of relationship between the keyboard and the mouse?
Thanks,
Shane.
(This is curious to me because I have a Vr-4121 based Workpad that's running
the Vr series kernel, and I have yet to get the PS/2 Trackpoint working on this
little device.  I pulled the machine to pieces and identified the controller
chip which was PS/2, but was unable to trace this back to a GPIO on the
processor, or back into the keyboard control interface.  The trackpoint chip is
the same as those employed in IBM laptops.)
