I think that this case can't happen until we add support for some other
touchpad that doesn't set the absmin/absmax variables. Both alps and
synaptics currently set them.
However, the fallback value should definitely not depend on
FRACTION_DENOM, since this constant doesn't affect the mouse speed at all.
It only affects how accurately we store the fractional part of dx and dy.
Ideally FRACTION_DENOM should be as large as possible without causing
arithmetic overflow. In practice, 128 seemed to be plenty enough.
So, the fallback value should be set to the estimated absmax-absmin value
for the hypothetical future touchpad driver that also hypothetically
doesn't set this value itself. I have no idea how to estimate this value
though, which is why I just used xres. ;)
