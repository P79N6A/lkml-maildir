Implemented the patch suggested, and the module no longer oops's, and I get 
codec id's listed as 0x0000:0x0000 (Unknown). I still get no sound like I 
did with 2.4.7 (using mpg123 as a test, with a known working mp3 file), and 
output to the device is blocked (nothing gets written).
How can I find out the ac97 codec ID for this chipset (if there is one) so 
it can be added to the ac97_codec_ids array? From what I can tell, it's as 
though the codec->codec_read(codec, AC97_VENDOR_ID#) isn't returning the 
codec value for this system at all.
Any suggestions?
