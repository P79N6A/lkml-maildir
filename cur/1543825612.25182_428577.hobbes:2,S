Hmm well, I have seen 30% performance increase for a random read work
load with NCQ, I'd say that is pretty nice. And of course there's the
whole write cache issue, with NCQ you _could_ get away with playing more
safe and disabling write back caching.
NCQ helps us with something we can never fix in software - the
rotational latency. Ordering is only a small part of the picture.
Plus I think that more recent drives have a better NCQ implementation,
the first models I tried were pure and utter crap. Lets just say it
didn't instill a lot of confidence in firmware engineers at various
unnamed drive companies.
