Ah Ben, you are hard to make happy.

Yes, of course. Recovery would have to happen through multiple steps,
one of which is re-enabling i/o.   (Another one would be to ask all of
the device drivers affected by the outage if any of them need a 
device reset.)
Right now, my goal was not to specify the final interface with all the
bits correct, but to get agreement that this particular approach, of
modifying struct pci_driver, would make everyone happy.
