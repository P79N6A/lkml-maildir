PIE = Position Independent Executable, that's how I named them.
These are not regular executables, they are basically DSOs but usually
compiled with -fpie/-fPIE instead of -fpic/-fPIC and linked with -pie
instead of -shared to allow the compiled and linker perform more
optimizations.

Jan unfortunately Ingo's document which doesn't really explain it.
