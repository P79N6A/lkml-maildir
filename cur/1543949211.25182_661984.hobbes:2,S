I tested it myself now with VT6306 on PPC32.

This indeed demonstrates the fix.  Any IO to SBP-2 devices fails with
timeouts.  Just removing the posted write enable bit in fw-ohci wasn't
sufficient to catch it though.  Maybe the controller has write posting
enabled by default.
However, this endianess bug was low-profile because there are currently
no kernelspace or userspace drivers for the firewire stack which need to
respond in split transactions.
