Lets address the compiler warnings point first:
1. If your build of 50,000 files produces 50 warnings per file, that's
   2,500,000 warnings.  You made the mistake of not initialising one
   variable, which produces a different compiler warning.  Are you going
   to spot this?  No.  Can it cause serious run-time errors?  Yes.
   Can it cause security holes?  Yes.
2. You accidentally forget the "return value;" statement at the end of
   a function - same problem as (1)
3. You accidentally leave a "return value;" statement at the end of a
   function - less serious, but you still want to know.
4. Cosmetically it looks bad.
5. It is _bad_ programming practice to write code that blatently violates
   standards for the language you're programming it in.
So, having a build that produces needless warnings is _BAD_.
Now lets address the "forcing better programming standards".  Well, we've
partially covered it above.  In addition, what you're proposing is crap
like:
static int foo(int *user_arg)
{
	struct bar_struct *bar;
	int arg;
	bar = kmalloc(...);
	if (bar)
		return -ENOMEM;
	get_user_ret(arg, user_arg, -EFAULT);
	arg = do_something(bar, arg);
	put_user_ret(arg, user_arg, -EFAULT);
	kfree(bar);
	return 0;
}
Now count the number of errors there _because_ of the hitten function
returns.  Is this good programming practise?  No.  Is it easy to write
the code in a way that doesn't do this?  No.  Is it obvious what its
doing?  No.
Experience has proven that if you give enough rope to driver writers,
they _will_ hang themselves.  They've done it many times in the past.
That is why it should be damned well obvious what the code is doing.
Which is why:
static int foo(int *user_arg)
{
	struct bar_struct *bar;
	int arg;
	bar = kmalloc(...);
	if (bar)
		return -ENOMEM;
	if (get_user(arg, user_arg))
		return -EFAULT;
	arg = do_something(bar, arg);
	if (put_user(arg, user_arg))
		return -EFAULT;
	kfree(bar);
	return 0;
}
is so much better.  You can immediately _see_ the error.  No hidden magic
functions that return underneath you.

Well, I've got news for you.  Your requested "consolidation" has already
been done.  Months ago.  The xxx_ret forms no longer exist in either 2.4
nor 2.5 for the reasons I've stated above.  And yes, "good programming
practice" is one of the reasons.
