It would be nice to be able to mount with any of the three possibilities:
1) Solaris style (show the underlying filesystem without regard for the 
   covering mounts on the servers filesytem.  This what the option
   CONFIG_NFSD_SUN=y gives you.)
2) The current Linux default. (Hide mount points.)
3) The new "crossnmt" style.
