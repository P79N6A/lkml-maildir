Yeah, that was probably the biggest issue we had integrating these 
machines. That, and the need for a monstrous power supply to feed those 
power-hungry CPUs.

Alas, it's PhoenixBIOS. Phoenix bought Award, though, so I'd expect Award 
to be phased out :(

This is my only experience with a dual Athlon board. There were some minor 
issues in kernel-space when we first bought these machines; using a recent 
(>2.4.18) kernel causes these problems to mostly disappear.
I helped the lm_sensors team with the sensors on this board; after 
extensive experimentation I managed to get both of the sensors chips 
(which are at the same I2C address ... WTF was tyan thinking?!) working 
and displaying data. I still am unsure which temperature sensor monitors 
which peripheral, but I've got a pretty good idea of it.
If something strange comes up, LMK and I might have a solution for you.
