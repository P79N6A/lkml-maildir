 Sorry, in round 2 I neglected to #include version.h.  Please ignore round 
2.
  Below is the old changelog, with this now added:
 * #include linux/version.h for in-kernel support
--------------
  Changes made:
 * No more magic numbers, all come from pci.h
 * no more udelay()'s, which covered up PCI posting effects
 * got rid of a __u8/__u16 here and there for u8/u16
 * ioctl code disabled for kernel >= 2.5 (now with version.h, too!)
 * bounded the number of times we could loop inside the interrupt function
 * spin_lock_irqsave/restore in open()/close()
 * better formatting
Thanks,
Kent
