I though about it, but it would create a race where the channel could be
accessed from user space before the private data pointer is set or the specific
inode operations are set.

Those inode operations are generic enough to eventually be integrated to
relayfs. The poll is enhanced to support multiple readers. For the ioctl, it's
just a matter of getting/pulling buffer segments, reading the number of
subbuffers and their size, which I think really fits the i/o control purpose for
such a file.

debugfs seems to offer really too much flexibility for what LTTng needs. It
doesn't really have to redefine "new" operations : the poll/ioctl used by LTTng
could in fact be integrated into RelayFS and simplify the file reading
operation.
