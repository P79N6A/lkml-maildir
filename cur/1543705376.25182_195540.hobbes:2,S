Hi!
Thanks a lot for pointing out these problems. I had completely missed them.
However, my overall problem is not solved. As far as my investigations 
led me, my sk_buff structure is never released after having been sent on 
the wire. So I guess I need an explicit destructor function in my 
sk_buff as the following is present in the definition of struct sk_buff:
void         (*destructor)(struct sk_buff *);    /* Destruct function    
    */
Well, until now what I tried lead to even more quicker kernel panics. If 
anyone has a good advice, I'd appreciate a lot.
'Thank you again,
         Emmanuel
