This looks really good, I'd like to see something like that merged soon!
Some comments:
 - please move the sector_t typedef from <linux/types.h> to <asm/types.h>,
   so 64 bit arches don't have to have the CONFIG_ option at all, some
   32bit plattforms that are unlikely to ever support large disks
   (m68k comes to mind) can make it 32bit unconditionally and some like
   i386 can use a config option.
 - sector_div should move to a common header (blkdev.h?)
And something related to general sector_t usage:
 - what about sector_t vs daddr_t?  Linux still has daddr_t, but it is
   still always 32bit, I think a big s/sector_t/daddr_t/ would fit the
   traditional unix way of doing disk addressing
 - why is the get_block block argument a sector_t?  It presents a logical
   filesystem block which usually is larger than the sector, not to
   mention that for the usual blocksize == PAGE_SIZE case a ulong is
   enough as that is the same size the pagecache limit triggers.
