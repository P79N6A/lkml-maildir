Well, it chops out a load of ugly ifdefs, and makes adding support
for a new bus less intrusive than it currently is. I quite like it.

I think you hit the nail on the head with the subject line.
struct BusDriver also conjures up amusing[*] imagery.
One thing I'm wondering about though. Is it possible for a new
bus to be added after boot ? Docking stations etc show up as
children on the root PCI bus, so that shouldn't be an issue.
Ah! hotplug PCI USB controller ?
Dave.
[*] I'm easily amused.
