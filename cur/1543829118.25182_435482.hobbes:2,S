Only ipw2200 drivers v1.1.1 and newer support v3.0 format firmware. The
page 
http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/firmware.php
 is correct.
There might be some patch to add the v3.0 firmware format support for
early drivers (e.g. v1.0.8) but that's out of the scope of the document.
When talking about driver versions we refer to the versions from
http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/downloads.php.
Thanks,
