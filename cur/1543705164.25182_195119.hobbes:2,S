Sorry, I hadn't gotten around to upgrading the glibc on my dev box. 
Here's the sysenter comparison:
Normal gettimeofday
gettimeofday ( 1239215us / 1000000runs ) = 1.239214us
vsyscall LD_PRELOAD gettimeofday
gettimeofday ( 805117us / 1000000runs ) = 0.805116us
It should be noted that all the numbers I've posted so far are using the
cyclone timesource. Here's the test running using the TSC timesource
(sysenter as well):
Normal gettimeofday
gettimeofday ( 586046us / 1000000runs ) = 0.586045us
vsyscall LD_PRELOAD gettimeofday
gettimeofday ( 179972us / 1000000runs ) = 0.179972us
thanks
