Ok, so the problem lies deeper. Could you take a guess at the version that
worked (say 2.2.17?) and the first one that stopped working (say 2.4.0-test1?)...
Once we have a rough range, I'll see if I can find anything.
Also: I assume you have PROC_FS compiled. What does /proc/net/z8530drv
contain before and after the failed packet TX attempt?
And: Can you receive any packets?
