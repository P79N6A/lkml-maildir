As the -stable patch review cycle is now over, I've released the
2.6.11.8 kernel in the normal kernel.org places.  Due to some
disagreement over some of the patches in the review cycle, I've dropped
a number of them.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.  
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.11.7 and 2.6.11.8, as it is small enough to do so.
And a personal thanks to OSU for letting me bore them by doing this in
their meeting.
thanks,
greg k-h
