Strange. I'm using an Acer Aspire 1640Z and the sound works perfectly. Of 
course Kubuntu was the only distro I could find that did OOB, but that's 
besides the point. In a quick look through /etc on my laptop I wasn't able to 
see how they do this. But after doing a quick check on Google the reports 
vary from this being a patched bug in ALSA to being easily solved by ensuring 
that the needed sound modules are loaded in the proper order.
An alternate solution to this is to load the snd-hda-intel module with the 
parameter "model=laptop"

From personal experience I can say that ACPI is needed for Acer notebooks with 
the centrino chipset to function properly.

I had the same problem when I tried Debian on this laptop. I don't recommend 
it for laptops, since there are several common pieces of hardware found on 
laptops that need firmware not shipped by Debian. This includes the ipw2200 
firmware - which most Acer laptops need, because they ship with that wireless 
card.
