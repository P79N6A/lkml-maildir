Subject: 2.5.5x COMMAND_LINE_SIZE cmdline problem
When booting the kernel with a long command line arguments, the kernel
will hang under 2.5.52, 2.5.53. Short command line is ok. 2.5.51 is ok.
# cat /proc/cmdline
root=/dev/hda2 ro reboot=hard hostname=boston.corp.fedex.com master=hda
network=none nssdns=0 apm=1 gpm=1 pccards=2 dma=1 lvm=1 reiser=1
modules="dm-mod ide-disk ide-probe-mod" /d /k autoexec BOOT_IMAGE=bzc1
I've tried both loadlin and linld with the same result.
It seems that COMMAND_LINE_SIZE is defined at several places with
different values ...
./arch/sh/kernel/setup.c
./arch/um/kernel/user_util.c
./arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
./include/asm-i386/setup.h
Thanks,
Jeff.
