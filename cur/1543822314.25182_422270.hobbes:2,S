These typedefs are a new hack to work around a basic interface problem:
instead of explicitly-sized types, Xen uses longs and pointers in its
interface. On PowerPC in particular, where we need a 32-bit userland
communicating with a 64-bit hypervisor, those types don't work.
However, the maintainers are reluctant to switch the interface to use
explicitly-sized types because it would break binary compatibility.
These ugly "HANDLE" macros allow PowerPC to do what we need without
affecting binary compatibility on x86.
