It should all work provided kgdb plays nicely.  We used to be able to
compile in both xmon and kdb and select at runtime which one gets
used.

Well, xmon_init(0) will do a detach.  However, I don't see that it is
needed; there is plenty of flexibility to choose to have xmon or not
using the CONFIG_XMON_DEFAULT config option and the xmon= boot command
line option.
