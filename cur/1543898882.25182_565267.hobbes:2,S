    Is it necessary that the firmware (may be bootloader) notify about
the MMC host to Linux? The kernel documentation (platform.txt) says :
 "The firmware should notify the platform bus about devices before the
legacy drivers have had a chance to load."
   Have I interpreted the above sentence correctly?
Thanks,
Midhun.
