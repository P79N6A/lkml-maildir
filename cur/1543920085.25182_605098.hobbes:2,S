It has always been that way because the behaviour of APM on SMP is not
defined.  We discovered early that it will work (at least for powering
off) for most SMP machines as long as the APM calls are done on CPU 0.
However on an SMP machine that does not cope, very bad things happen -
thus the operator has to explictly enable the power off behaviour on an
SMP box.  (On UP power off is enabled by default.)
