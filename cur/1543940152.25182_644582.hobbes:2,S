Sorry, this is subtle and I've overlooked it before.
(I thought you were only changing ifdef).
Now you memcpy() over pg_dir when that pgdir is in use during swsusp
resume. Granted, you memcpy() with same data that already are there,
but it may still do some funny effects.
Hmm, but same argument applies to lower levels of paging in 64-bit and
PAE cases, and we still do that memcpy-over-active-pagetables there...
:-(.
