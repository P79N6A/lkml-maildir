I have a patch that makes it configurable but Kamezawa-san posted a very
promising patch about making all zones configurable in a very clever way
which is more general than what I did. He posted it as an RFC[1] and there
was feedback from Andy Whitcroft on how it could be made better so it wouldn't
have been picked up for -mm but something is in the pipeline.
I've tested his patch for zone movable and it worked as advertised so I
intended to see post-merge window what else could be done with it clean-up
wise. I am curious to see if it can also make ZONE_NORMAL configurable on
machines that only have ZONE_DMA for example.

Excellent.
