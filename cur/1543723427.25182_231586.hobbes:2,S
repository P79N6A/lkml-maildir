it will get the wakeup, but that doesn't mean wait4 will return if
it's waiting for all childs. Now I don't know but with strace it may
even be ok by luck, but it certainly changes the semantics of
wait4/ptrace at least a little and I could remotely imagine if somebody
wants a wait4 to return when a ptraced child exited, if there are other
"regular" children. That's why I admitted it can be considered a feature
and not a completely worthless effort to leave self-reaping tasks as
zombies if they're ptraced.
