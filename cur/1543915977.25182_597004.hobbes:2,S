Start by eliminating the filesystem. i.e. run the same test using
different offsets on the raw device (e.g. seek one fd a few gigabytes
further into the disk than the other then start reading).
Also, you might want to check that you are comparing apples to apples;
are the two files you used in each test the same? If not, are
they all unfragmented, in the same AGs (i.e. all on the same area of
disk as there's a 2x speed difference betweem the inner and outer edges),
etc....
Cheers,
Dave.
