Those patches are in Andi's tree.  His tree has the old versions.  The
patches are inter-tangled so it is non-trivial for me to generate
incremental patches on top of Andi's tree which bring his old patches up to
date with the new ones.  I could of course do so, but it'd be better if
Andi's tree weren't carrying old versions of
x86_64-ia32-vdso-install-unstripped-copies-on-disk and
x86_64-vdso-install-unstripped-copies-on-disk
Please resend those patches to Andi.
