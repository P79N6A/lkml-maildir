One word: Ouch.
Basically the corruption introduced adds random feature bits into the
superblock that aren't actually in use. And hence instead of having
valid superblock fields for each of those features, they are zero
and so strange stuff happens.
What is really stupid is that the fields are often checked. By
ASSERT(), not by production code so a debug kernel will pick up the
problem and panic, while a production kernel will continue onwards
until it panics. This is not going to be a small patch.....
Cheers,
Dave.
