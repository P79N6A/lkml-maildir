Ahoj Pavle,
zkousel jsem vsechny predchozi jadra co tu mam 2.6.16.16,2.6.17.3 a delaj to 
taky. To vypada spis jako chybu v nejakem upgradovanem programu. Napadaj me 
Xka nebo BlueZ stack.
Co je zajimavy, ta prodleva je presne 60 sekund a moje druha BT mys Logitech 
V270 ani moje USB mys to nedelaji.
Michal
Hi Pavel,
I was testing all previous kernel versions I have (2.6.16.16, 2.6.17.3) which 
worked before and it is also happening in them now. So it looks like error in 
some external out-of-kernel stuff. Maybe X.org or BlueZ utils???
Is interresting, that delay when sensor switch off is 60 seconds (like some 
timer) and my second BT mouse Logitech V270 and also my USB mouse don't do 
that and sensor is always on. When I connect Microsoft mouse to W2000 or my 
old linux installation, sensor also don't switch off.
Any clue whom to ask now?
Thanks
Michal
