A NFS client through 100Mb Ether takes a loooooooong time to read a database
from the server, which the server itself reads in less than 10 seconds.
The database is a scene description for render that basically 'includes'
the same small set of files (around 10) many times, instanced all over the
place...
Mount in client:
10.0.0.1:/home on /home type nfs (rw,nfsvers=2,noac,addr=10.0.0.1)
Looking at nfsstats in the server:

What is that ton of getattr ? Do they come from nfs itself or must be
done by the reader via stat()s (perhaps it checks for file presence before
opening) ?
Is there any way to speedup that ?
Will nfs-v3 perform better ?
TIA
