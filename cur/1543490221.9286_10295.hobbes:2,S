I looked into this. It's ugly. It requires changes to the Makefile and
link scripts on every architecture. I've discussed this with MEC and we
came to the conclusion that we need a clean and easy way to include binary
images as ELF sections in 2.3. I suspect this will involve a helper script
or program of some sort.
There's actually quite a bit of stuff that's currently arch-specific that
needn't be.
