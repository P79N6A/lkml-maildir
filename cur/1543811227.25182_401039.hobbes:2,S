This does not do what you're trying to accomplish.  sfence has no impact 
on the flushing of the write combining buffers -- they're normally flushed 
after a few cycles of no subsequent merges.  If it is really necessary to 
flush such a write, you will have to do a read from the target PCI device 
(well, bus would do).
