Beloved
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me,
because, I 
Believe 
everyone will die someday. My name is Roy David.I 
have been diagnosed 
with 
Heart Disease, which my Doctors over here 
say there is a possibility of 
my 
health being critical. It has 
defiled all forms of medicine, and right 
now 
my doctor has concluded 
that I just have a couple of months to live. I 
have 
not particularly 
lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 
anyone 
not even 
myself but my business.
Though I am wealthy, I was never generous; I 
Was always hostile to 
people 
and only focus on my business as that 
was the only thing I cared for. 
But 
now I regret all this as I now 
know that there Is more to life than 
just 
wanting to have or make 
all 
the Money in the
world.
I believe when God gives me a second 
chance to 
come to this world I 
would 
live my life a different way 
from how I 
have lived it. Now that God Has 
Called me, I have willed 
and given 
most of my properties and assets to 
my 
Immediate and 
extended family 
members and as well as a few close 
friends.I 
Want 
God to be merciful 
to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided 
to 
Give alms to 
charity organizations, as I want this to be one of 
the 
last 
Good 
deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed some 
of my wealth 
to 
some charity organizations in the Europe and eastern 
Asia. Now that my 
Health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this 
my self any more.
I 
once asked members of my family to close one of 
my accounts and 
distribute 
the money, which I have there to charity 
organization in 
Germany; they 
refused and kept the money to 
themselves. Hence, I do 
not trust them 
Anymore, as they seem not to 
be contended with what I 
have left for
them.
The last of my wealth 
which none of my family 
members are aware about 
has 
been safely 
stored away in a storage 
firm. I don't want to give too 
much 
details 
now until I am sure that 
you are willing and a Trustworthy 
candidate 
to carry out my last 
wishes. I hope this mail Reaches you 
well and 
have 
a 
wonderful day.
Yours Faithfully,
Roy David
