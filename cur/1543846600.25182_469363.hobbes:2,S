Subject: PCI/IDE generic IDE driver + bus master DMA logic errors

our hardware guys are designing an pci/ide controller which has  
interrupt wrapper such that the ide & bus master interrupts are  
packaged & delivered together.
according to current linux ide sub-system believe i have to do  
something like implement ide_ack_intr(). quite clear. would like to  
know how to escalate bus-master dma or device errors, on return from  
ide_ack_intr?
