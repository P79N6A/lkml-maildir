  The only time I ever needed this "end line recalculation" was when the heigh in
 graphic lines was not a multiple of the character heigh - i.e. 640x350 with 8x16
 or 8x8 chars - some VGA adapters do not hide the bottom graphic lines.
  The function vga_set_480_scanlines() is not called, and the protect bit is never
 cleared - the video BIOS leaving those low index register protected.
  The function vga_recalc_vertical() (or its assembler equivalent) is probably
 perfectly called but because the protect bit is never cleared, the few graphic
 line are displayed during the whole Linux text session...
  I have myself never seen any other problems when the graphic heigh is a multiple
 of the character heigh - tested on ~40 video boards.
  Etienne.
