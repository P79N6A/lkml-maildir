I think you're confusing NMI handling, they aren't like your normal 
interrupts. You're not going to see that context switch.

Can you change prev and next atomically?

Again, are you mistaking this for a normal interrupt?

At a fair interrupt rate i'd rather have that fill my caches, less time 
spent in the NMI handler means more overall system time.
