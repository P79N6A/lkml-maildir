Wouldn't we typically have all free pages > min_free in state U?
Also wouldn't all R/O mapped pages not also be V, all R/W mapped pages
and unmapped page-cache pages P like you state in your paper.
This patch would just increase the number of V pages with the tail end
of the guest LRU, which are typically the pages you would want to evict
(perhaps even add 5th guest state to indicate that these V pages are
preferable over the others?)
But isn't it so that for the gross over-commit scenario you outline the
host OS will have to swap out S pages eventually?
