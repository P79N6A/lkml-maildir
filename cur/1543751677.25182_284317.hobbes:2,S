The inter_module_xxx free DRM is already in Linus BK. Sooner or later
the inter_module_xx exports in the AGP driver should disappear too.
DRM now handles things at compile time. If AGP is enabled at compile
time, AGP support gets built into the DRM module. If AGP is not
enabled, AGP does not get compiled in. If you try to take a DRM that
was built for AGP and move it to a system without, it's not going to
load because it will need the AGP symbols.
