Sorry for wasting bandwidth.  Ignore both these problems for now.
First one seems to have been related to the xosview bug (chewed up
100% CPU so it made the other task look stuck).  I also applied
Andrea's fixes for the process stuck in 'D' state problem just in
case.
The second problem may be a diald issue.  I'll compile and install the
latest version and see if that solves things.
