Subject: [2.6.23 regression fix] fix thinkpad_acpi without hardware
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

René Treffer reported that booting a CONFIG_THINKPAD_ACPI=y kernel on a 
machine without the hardware results in an Oops.
The trace is thinkpad_acpi_module_init -> thinkpad_acpi_module_exit -> 
driver_remove_file -> sysfs_hash_and_remove.
The error handling if thinkpad_acpi_module_init() fails generally looks 
suspicious, but this patch at least fixes the common case if no hardware 
was found, and it seems in this case there isn't any cleanup 
actually required.
Broken by commit d5a2f2f1d68e2da538ac28540cddd9ccc733b001.
