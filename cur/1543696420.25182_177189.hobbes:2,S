Thank you for the clarification.
That leads me to 2 followup questions.
If a task in the kernel is preempted, is a membar issued?  (I believe
so -- running another task means that the scheduler must have run,
which will grab and release various locks thus giving us the membars.)
When the preempted task resumes, is it guaranteed to run on the same CPU?
(I wouldn't expect so, unless the task was specifically told to do that
via hard affinity.  But maybe a task preempted in the kernel is different
then a task preempted in userland.)
