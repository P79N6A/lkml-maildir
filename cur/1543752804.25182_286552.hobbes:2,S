kprobes is not portable.

I have to agree with this. relayfs should resemble a very simple pipe, 
maybe making it possible to writing them directly to disk.
ltt has the same problem. It still does way too much at event time, it 
should just pump the data to disk and postprocess it later. I think it's 
better to implement multiple traces in user space via a daemon, which 
synchronizes multiple users.

While I agree this is needed, I don't think it's a reason against merging, 
it should just be made clear, that the API is not stable and will change.
