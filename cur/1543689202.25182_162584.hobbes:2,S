   RT frame works are running single kernel under some kind of RT OS.
   It should be possible to develop framework to run several Linuces 
under single instance of another OS (or Linux itself). And every 
instance of slave Linux whould be told which resources it is responsible 
for.
   You can /partition/ memory, you can say that given instance of kernel 
should use e.g. only CPUs from Nth to N+Mth.
   But some resources - like IDE controllers, GPUs, NICs - are not that 
easy to share. Actually most of the resources are not trivial to share.
   And I'm not sure what will turns out to be easier: write very 
scaleable kernel or make kernel been able to share efficiently resources 
with others.
P.S. My personal belief - that SMP is never going to become comodity. 
EPIC/VLIW - probably. Not SMP/AMP.
