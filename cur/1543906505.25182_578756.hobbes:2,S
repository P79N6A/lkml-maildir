Yes for sure when netif state is running and we were already doing that.

I suggested calling pci_enable_device() in ->open(), not calling
pci_restore_state() in ->open().  I ultimately decided against it
because some devices do not enable memory as a workaround and it would
be messy to deal with it again in tg3_open().
I definitely agree that calling PCI restore in ->open() is a bad idea.
We used to save PCI state in ->probe() once and restore PCI state after
every chip reset.  This sequence caused many subtle problems.
