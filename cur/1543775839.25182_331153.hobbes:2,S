Yes, we did experience a problem. The routing doesnt work as advertised 
(i.e. it wont utilize the multiple routes). Patrick is correct in saying 
its missing support.
From what you are saying it seems the problem will be corrected by a new 
feature in iproute2 that allows the user to select this ability. Is this 
correct? Also, does this mean my patch is not needed? It seems to me that 
it should be supported somehow in the kernel seeing as how everyone might 
not utilize iproute2.
Once again, please cc me in the reply because I am not a member of the 
list.
Thanks,
