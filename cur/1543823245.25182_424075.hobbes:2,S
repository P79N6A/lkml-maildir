Subject: [PATCH 0/4] VFS fileop cleanups by collapsing AIO and vector IO
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
These series of patches clean up and streamlines generic_file_*
interfaces in filemap.c. This time, to avoid public humiliation,
I compiled (allmodconfig) the patchset on 3 different architectures
(i386, x86_64, ppc64) and 4 different compilers versions and made
sure this patchset didn't introduce any new error & warnings :)
This is a patchset against 2.6.17-rc4, so won't apply cleanly on
-mm (few minor fixes in ocfs2, nfs & jffs2 needed). If you want me 
to send patchset against 2.6.17-rc4-mm1, please let me know.
Note:
1. I couldn't reproduce the compiler warning you got:
fs/aio.c: In function `aio_advance_iovec':
fs/aio.c:1314: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a
cast
So, I didn't fix this.
=====
First (3) patches collapses all the vectored IO support into
single set of file-operation method using aio_read/aio_write.
This work was originally suggested & started by Christoph Hellwig,
when Zach Brown tried to add vectored support for AIO.
Patch 4, sets all the filesystems .read/.write/.aio_read/.aio_write
methods correctly to allow us to cleanup most generic_file_*_read/write
interfaces in filemap.c
After this patch set, we should end up with ONLY following
read/write (exported) interfaces in filemap.c:
        generic_file_aio_read() - read handler
        generic_file_aio_write() - write handler
        generic_file_aio_write_nolock() - no lock write handler
Here is the summary:
[PATCH 1/4] Vectorize aio_read/aio_write methods
[PATCH 2/4] Remove readv/writev methods and use aio_read/aio_write
instead.
[PATCH 3/4] Core aio changes to support vectored AIO.
[PATCH 4/4] Streamline generic_file_* interfaces and filemap cleanups
BTW, Chuck Lever is actually re-arranging NFS DIO, AIO code to
fit into this model.
Thanks to Chuck Lever, Shaggy, Christoph, Zach Brown, Ben LaHaise 
for helping out. 
Thanks,
Badari
