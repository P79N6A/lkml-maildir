Of course - use IA64, Sparc, or PPC.
IA32 is by definition limited to 4G. Just because the Kernel may, under
extreem duress, access more by memory management shenanigans access more,
user processes are ALWAYS limited to a 32 bit virtual address. Even this
is more restricted, since shared libraries and other access limits it even
more. Usually you can stretch it to 3G, but not over that.
search the archives - the details are available.
