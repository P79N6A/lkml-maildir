Not irrelevant to the callers ;)
And Andrew might reasonably choose to prioritize fixes,
depending in part on the impact of what they fix.
Ah - there is one more use of *_complement, in i386/mach-es7000.
But it masks the result in the next line with cpu_online_map, so
also avoids propogating the damage.

Hmmm ... could you elaborate on this?  I don't see this bug.
