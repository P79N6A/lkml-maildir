Mine still survives with this ... with sleep 1 ...
# for((i=0; i<100; i++)); do echo $i; echo $((i % 2))
>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online; sleep 1; done
and this as well ... without sleep ...
# for((i=0; i<100; i++)); do echo $i; echo $((i % 2))
>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online; done
I'm on reiserfs. gcc 3.4.5. Config sent to you seperately so as not to
cloud lkml. If anyone wants the config, please let me know. Is mime
"attachment" acceptable now on lkml?
Thanks,
Jeff.
