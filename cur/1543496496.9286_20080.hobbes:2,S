Sounds good.

Cool, I will try it out. How long before this thing becomes stable 
and potentially becomes a standard part of the Linux kernel? Or is 
there resistance to including this code in the kernel?
I would like to add support for using this interface in our 
libraries, so that if the patch is in the kernel we will use it, 
otherwise we will fall back on the existing ghastly hacks that we 
already have in the MGL.
