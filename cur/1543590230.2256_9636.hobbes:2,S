Only sort-of.  There are some cases where you can get away with that.  
Probably.  eg If you ask for PARPORT, on x86 that means yes to PARPORT_PC,
always (right?)  On other arches (someone brought this up before) it could
be PC, it could be something else.  My point is there are only some cases
where you can get away with asking for serial and knowing the driver.  I've
given this some thought before, and at least on PPC, you can at best segment
off some drivers as depending on family X, but family X doesn't mean you
have part Y.  The other thing to keep in mind is I'm sure there's lots of
unintentionally correct bits.  In short, please be very careful when you
change a symbol from a question to a derive.  You're bound to piss off 
someone :)
