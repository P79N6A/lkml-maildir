Hi there,
Newcomer to the List. I have an S3-Trio 64V+ Card. In the configuration of the
kernel, the framebuffer thing for S3 trio is disabled. But, while exploring the
sources I saw that there is the file related to framebuffer in S3 Trio.
How do I enabled it so that I can use the framebuffer for S3 and 
one more question is that why cannot it be enabled from 'make xconfig'???
Any particular reason why ??
Regards
