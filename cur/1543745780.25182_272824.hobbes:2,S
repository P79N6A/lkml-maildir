Hi!

Well, speed is nice but... I have O(n^2) => O(n) patch in my tree that
provides some nice speedup too, and is less invasive. They are
probably orthogonal.
* you'll have to explain (in Documentation/power/swsusp.txt) why this
is safe. Normal swsusp is safe because interrupts&DMAs are
disabled. You are doing writes but data in page-cache may not be
modified, right? What are exact requirements for this and how it is
guaranteed that data are indeed not modified?
* what is pcs_ prefix? Page Cache Suspend?
(ouch and be warned that this will take quite long to get
in. There are patches in my queue I'd like to get in first, like
O(n^2) => O(n) page marking).

"po" is bad name even for local variable.

Can't you just get another bit in page.h to avoid these arrays?

Please take % progress from newer swsusp.

I'd understand int resume taking 0 and 1, but what does 2 mean? Also
use return 0; not return (0);
