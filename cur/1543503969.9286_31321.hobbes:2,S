We are trying to use two dumb multiport ISA boards in the same Linux box.
Each of them (Parvus board based on 16554 UARTs) has 8 ports.
We are using the standard serial line driver (kernel 2.2.5) and one 
IRQ per board (each IRQ is shared over the 8 ports).
Each board works fine separetly but when configurating both together
no more IRQs are produced. Any suggestion why?
Thanks,
	manuel
