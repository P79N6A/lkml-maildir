Cool. But a few questions:
1) Can you supply (automatically created) incremental patches? It saves 
a lot of time to just be able to apply the increments in a (manually) 
patched up tree. Furthermore, it saves download time as it is a huge 
patch (POTS modem...).
2) What about the new scheduler? Is that a candidate for 2.4.23 (or even 
2.4.22)? I'm asking this because I'm playing around with swsusp patches 
(created for 2.4.21) and the new scheduler in -ac breaks a few things 
there. If is is a candidate for 2.4.xx real soon, then we need to fix 
it. Otherwise, it can be postponed.
Regards,
Bas.
