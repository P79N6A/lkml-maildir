Hi,
  Just a quick question. I was building 2.6.3 with allyesconfig and I noticed it was making many built-in.o files around the place. These are quite large object files
Eg. in fs is 
74992735 Feb 23 15:35 built-in.o
  74Meg for the filesystems code and thats with even the individual .o files compiled with -Os
  I haven't noticed this happening before. Is it new for 2.6.x?
Thanks, Gordon
