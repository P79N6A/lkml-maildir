yes, but isn't the displacement here (0x007) a _bytes_ displacement ?. so
effectively, %ecx now contains physical address of pg0 + 7bytes. Is it A 
meaningful place/address ?.

Great!, Thanks a lot.

Sorry for not making the question clear. my question was that the first entry in
the page table pointed by (%edi) is initialize with %eax = 0x007, a reasonable
value (setting the 3 pte flags). Beginning from entry 2, they got initialized
with a value = "new %eax = old %eax + 8", generating a table of entries
initialized with 7, 15, 31, .. . While this scheme makes the 3 PRESENT, RW 
and USER flags set, it makes alot of "pte"s with equivalent "pfn"s. Here comes 
my wonder, why initializing pg0 that way ?.
Thanks,
