the !offset check looks a pretty broken heuristic indeed, it would
break random I/O. The real fix is to add a ra.prev_offset along with
ra.prev_page, and if who implements it wants to be stylish he can as
well use a ra.last_contiguous_read structure that has a page and
offset fields (and then of course remove ra.prev_page).
