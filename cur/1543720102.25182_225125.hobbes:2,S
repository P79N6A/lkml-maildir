This is rather convenient. I have an Epox 8RDA+ as well. What video card are 
you using in that box?
I'll install mplayer and see if I can replicate (I have an ATI 9800 Pro, but I 
can easily stuff a number of nvidia cards in there to check).
If you're using an ATI or Nvidia card, are you using the proprietary or 
opensource drivers?
