No, this sucks.
Sane configurations already have the FQDN as the hostname. It's quite 
common to have "hostname" be the full name, and domainname be "(none)" 
(with dnsdomainname being the domain name).
I think your patch would make it say
	torvalds@g5.osdl.org.osdl.org
for me.
So just fix your hostname to give the full hostname. Nothing less makes 
any sense anyway.
