I have udev here, and it generates several useful symlinks.
/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.1-scsi-0:0:0:0-part2 will always point
to the second primary partition of the IDE master on the first IDE
channel here, be there as many USB sticks as there may.
(But still I'd like it if it wasn't named "scsi-0:0:0:0", because the
"0:0:0:0" part could change.)

I don't think there was any intent to merge namespaces. It "just happened"
as a byproduct of having sata/pata use the scsi subsystem.
