Subject: [PATCH] compat_ioctl: introduce generic_compat_ioctl helper
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Many drivers use only compatible ioctl numbers. In order to
avoid having to write a special compat_ioctl handler for each
of them or listing every ioctl number in fs/compat_ioctl.c,
let's introduce a generic handler that simply calls the
driver specific f_op->unlocked_ioctl() or f_op->ioctl() handler.

Is this what you had in mind? I've been meaning to do something like
it for some time, but had forgotten about it.
I guess we can kill a significant amount of COMPATIBLE_IOCTL
lines in fs/compat_ioctl.c with this.
