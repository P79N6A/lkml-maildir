It's unusual that the failure has been only in -mm, and for so long.  That
would indicate that we have a problem in a for-mm-only patch.
And yet your patch applies OK to 2.6.16-rc4, so it's not obvious how this
got in there.
Did you never perform a bisection as per
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/bisecting-mm-trees.txt,
find out which patch in -mm was the offender?

They all sound like good stuff - I'll take a look, thanks.

Sorry, this was hot-fixed.  See
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc4/2.6.16-rc4-mm1/hot-fixes/.
 You'll want revert-register-sysfs-device-for-lp-devices.patch.  May as
well apply the others, too..
