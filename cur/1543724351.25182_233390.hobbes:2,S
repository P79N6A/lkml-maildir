nothing particularly unusual on my system ... when an updatedb or a 'cvs
up' or 'make install' of kde are running i often get hangs of up to 10
seconds (not the sound, though, as xmms with oss output seems less
susceptible to this, but "random" other processes freeze hard for that
time). and with 2.4 ... errm ... 30 seconds are usual, and 60 seconds
are still not exceptional.
for the record: i have 1GB of ram, no swap, and reasonably fast disks
(and yes, udma is enabled ;).
