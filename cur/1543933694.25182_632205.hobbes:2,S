as a sidenote: bugs like this seem to be reoccuring. People implement 
sysfs bindings (without being sysfs internals experts - and why should 
they be) - and create hard to debug problems. We've seen that with the 
scheduler's recent sysfs changes too.
shouldnt the sysfs code be designed in a way to not allow such bugs? The 
primary usecase of sysfs is by people who do _not_ deal with it on a 
daily basis. So if they pick APIs that look obvious and create hard to 
debug problems (and userspace incompatibilities) that's a primary 
failure of sysfs, not a failure of those who utilize it.
At a minimum there should be some _strong_ debugging facility that 
transparently detects and reports such bugs as they occur. 
CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT is totally unusable right now, it spams the syslog 
(so no distro ever enables it - i disable it in random bootups as well 
because it takes _ages_ to even get to a boot prompt) and never finds 
any of these hard-to-find-but-easy-to-explain bugs.
or if sysfs/kobjects should be scrapped and rewritten, do you have any 
insight into what kind of abstraction could/should replace it? Should we 
go back to procfs and get rid of kobjects altogether? (as it's slowly 
turning into a /proc problem of itself, with worse compatibility and 
sneakier bugs.)
