Ok, I think this could well be the same problem I got half way through
tracking last time round.  We are still handing off threads with
non-initialised stacks.
APW: schedule: ffffffff805f0cd8 bad rsp flags=00000000
Kernel panic - not syncing: BAD STACK POINTER
Interestingly this has remained unchanged for dispite the major churn
-mm takes so this could well be the underlying issue as we almost always
blow up randomly when we do this, in a mess with no stack to work with.
Last time I tried to split search -mm1 and she was being a hideous pig,
I just couldn't get any bit of it to compile without the rest.  Will try
and track this down with the new -mm.
