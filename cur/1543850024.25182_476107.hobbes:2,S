Subject: [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.4.3.2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.4.3.2 is available at the
usual places:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
  git-1.4.3.2.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.4.3.2.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.4.3.2.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.3.2-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
This is primarily to fix two rather embarrasing breakage
discovered post 1.4.3.1 release.
 - The pager change to default to LESS=FRS exposed problem with less
   that switches to alternate screen, shows its output and then switches
   back immediately from the alternate screen afterwards -- which means
   the user would not have a chance to see _anything_.
 - Older upload-pack protocol clients did not pass host= and recent
   git-daemon change to support virtual hosting did not handle this
   correctly (although it attempted to do so, the check was borked).
