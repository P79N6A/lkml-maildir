If you can run normal C code, yes.  It doesn't require any
initialization.

Why?  Other than the nul term (which I agree with), I didn't understand
that code.  
Get the archs to pass some command line in.  eg. i386 can do:
-	parse_cmdline_early(cmdline_p);
+	parse_early_options(*cmdline_p);
I feel that anyone destroying command lines should do their own
saving, and we should head that way...
Thanks,
Rusty.
