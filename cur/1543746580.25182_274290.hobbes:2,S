Is anyone else experiencing spontaneous reboots within a few minutes of 
bootup?  (If the system survives past the first 10 minutes, it stays up 
for a long time, but it reliably does an instant reboot with no panic or 
other indication a good 9 out of 10 times.  The system is purely idle, 
nothing going on.  memtest86+ runs for hours with no failures.
