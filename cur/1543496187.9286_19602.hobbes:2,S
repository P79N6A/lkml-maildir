Subject: serial interrupts on 2.2.7

Running 2.2.7 here, I often run into this problem: my serial ports, though
detected perfectly by setserial, fail to show interrupts in
/proc/interrupts. This happens with my soundcard as well, occasionally
(though right now it does have an interrupt - none for the serials
though).
Is this a known problem?
I also get quite a few sound-slot-* and sound-service-*-* messages in my
syslog. Is there a place where I can look these up? Though I've looked
through sb.c and sound.c / soundcore.c I've found no suggestion of the
specific numbers.
(Adam, I cc'ed you because you're author of the base conf.modules file
which is - AFAIK - the sole authority on this - apart from the actual
sources :)
