Hi, Ingo,
I missed commit 75d4ef16a6aa84f708188bada182315f80aab6fa
"sched: fix delay accounting performance regression"
Without these changes, I find that delay accounting does
not work as expected, I see zeros in the field for virtual,delay
and count(s).
CPU             count     real total  virtual total    delay total
                    0      535861848              0              0
This breaks existing delay accounting behaviour.
Am I missing something?
