When you look at the benchmark there is no difference between ll and 
ll+pre-empt. ll alone takes you to the 1ms point. pre-empt takes you no
further and to get much out of pre-emption requires you go and do all the
hideously slow and complex priority inversion stuff.

We have to work around common hardware not designed for SMP - the 8390 isnt
a broken chip in that sense, its just from a different era, and there are a 
lot of them.
