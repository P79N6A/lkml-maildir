Bear with me Dave, I'll repeat myself a bit, for the benefit of lkml.

Yep, same as SPARC (at least, SPARC's 32-bit atomic_t).

Not a generic cmpxchg, no. However, I _believe_ that those
architectures that are missing something like ll/sc or real
atomic cmpxchg should still be able to implement an
"atomic_cmpxchg" on their atomic type.
Sorry if I wasn't at all clear initially. What I'd be interested
in is an architecture that doesn't support ll/sc or real cmpxchg
*and* does not implement atomic_t operations with locks.
Thanks,
Nick
