Absolutely.  But, given the relatively late-stage initialization of
these attributes (it's the last thing that gets done before probe()
completes)-- the driver has already allocated (successfully) memory,
intialized hardware and (possibly) presented storage, the complete
unwinding, seems over-kill.
