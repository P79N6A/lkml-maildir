Yeah, sure. I realise that. But if resources are going to be put into
setting up a test bench, I'd hope that it's not too narrowly focussed.
The FreeBSD ftp results prompted Larry to promote the idea of a
"community" test bench. Let's see if we can expand the terms of

Are you suggesting that promoting a more flexible test bench is a bad
idea?
