How about following the system device scheme: 1 call, with interrupts 
disabled?

That's fine. I will fix PCMCIA, as I have devices to test with. I have no 
ARM devices (nor do I want any). I can take a stab, but won't guarantee 
anything. Could you tell me, though, when/if these devices did work with 
what power management scheme? APM?

We talked about that, and it's going to require some changes to the core, 
albeit small. We're not prepared to do that right now, though we'll 
reconsider depending on necessity and impact of the patch..
