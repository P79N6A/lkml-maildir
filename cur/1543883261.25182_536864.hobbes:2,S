So this is a completely debugged bug in a well-maintained subsystem
(no matter what the status in Bugzilla is).
The problem is that the other 1600 open bugs aren't in this state.

That's one of the problems: Unmaintained subsystems.
Since you stepped down as serial maintainer (and it's your right as 
maintainer to do so), the serial subsystem is unmaintained.
That's exactly where Linus' "drop any bug reports that are more than a 
week old" suggestion is completely flawed - no matter what the submitter 
does, how often he tests latest kernels, noone will help him.

New subsystems always get default owners like   	 
drivers_ieee1394@kernel-bugs.osdl.org, and people interested in such 
bugs can edit their preferences to watching all (pseudo) users in whose 
bugs they are interested. drivers_serial@kernel-bugs.osdl.org [1] would 
be the logical defult owner.
