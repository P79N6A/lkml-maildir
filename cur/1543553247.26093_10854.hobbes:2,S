Hello,
The Highpoint Technologies HPT370 ATA-100 + RAID chip is supported well
the lastest releases but it's RAID features are not implemented. I've
heard rumours telling that this chip isn't a real RAID chip possessing
only minimal (if any) hardware RAID capabilities and even those are
undocumented. Is this right or are there any plans to implement some RAID
features, as far as it would do any difference compared to the
really nicely working software-RAID? (Andre Hedrick?)
