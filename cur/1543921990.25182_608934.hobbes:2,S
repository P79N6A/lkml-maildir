Right.  This is exactly the problem.  The current grab API exists to
prevent keys from being delivered to normal users, but rfkill still
wants to see them.
No matter how you slice it, if both of these desires are to be satisfied
then there needs to be some sort of a system to differentiate between
rfkill and "normal users".  That's what the priority is here.

I disagree.  Dependencies aren't a problem at all if people merely rely
on the kernel to take care of the appropriate filtering.  Dependencies
only become a problem when X needs to know about "ok... maybe I should
ignore keys that are handled by [hal] [rfkill] [others] etc...".
