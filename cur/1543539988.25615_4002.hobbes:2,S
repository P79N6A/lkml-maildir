my Abit SM5 broke after a BIOS upgrade. Phoned Abit and they posted
me a new xxPROM on condition that I post the old one back to them

i can't believe this. if i buy a motherboard and it doesn't function
properly, then i can talk to the vendor who may:
1. replace the board
2. tell me to upgrade the bios
if 2. goes wrong they must replace the board. (certainly under
European Consumer law)
