i use NOHZ enabled kernel for test. I just noticed that i have the
same timer interrupts as if NOHZ was not selected (e.g. 2.6.22/x86_64)

AMD say: C1E is a Stop Grant state like C3 supported by dual core
mobile processors.
The difference between C1E and C3 is that transition into C1E is not
initiated by the
operating system. The C1E state is initiated by an I/O transaction to
the chipset when
both cores transition into the C1 state.

I think, it should support C1 and C2 at least.
