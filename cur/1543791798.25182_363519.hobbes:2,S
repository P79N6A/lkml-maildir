Are you sure that's the problem?
Directory starts with 26 files named A-F.
Reading through directory starts at A, makes it to J (position 10).
File B gets deleted.
directory reading continues at new position 11, which is now L.
So directory read returns A-J, L-Z, and never returns K even though K didn't 
change.
The "that file" mentioned by SuSv3 above would be _B_ here.  Not K.  K didn't 
change.
That said, I'm pretty sure it's the old libc behavior that's defective.  If a 
new entry B' had been inserted instead, the directory traversal would have 
seen L twice.  Iterating by position is just wrong...
