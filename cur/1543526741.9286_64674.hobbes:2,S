That depends on how static your "static" program is...  even though ldd
may say the program is statically linked, glibc programs are almost never
fully static due to the (stupid in my opinion) name service switch logic
dynamically loading libraries at run-time that were never referenced at
compile time.  (Solaris does something similar, but then Sun doesn't
support fully static binaries anyway.)
Use strace to watch what your program is actually doing.  My bet is some
libnss_*.so thing is overloading your mmap()ed area.
