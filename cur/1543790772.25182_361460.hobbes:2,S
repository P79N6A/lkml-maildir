Subject: [PATCH] Add be*/le* types without underscores
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi:
I've seen a number of patches that have started to use the __le*/__be*
types within the kernel.  Nice as they are, the underscores are really
a bit of an eye sore.  Since there seems to be no name conflict within
the kernel, why don't we use them without the underscores like just as
we do with types like u32?
Here is a patch to do just that.  I've verified that there are no
conflicts by grepping the current git tree and then building it with
the patch.
Of course userspace won't see them since they're protected by
#ifdef __KERNEL__.
