Well they are the vast majority of NUMA systems Linux runs on.
And there are more than just Opterons, e.g. IBM Summit. And even
the majority of Altixes are not _that_ big.
Of course we need to deal somehow with the big systems, but
for the good defaults the smaller systems are more important.
Big systems tend to have capable administrators who
are willing to tweak them. But that's rarely the case with
the small systems. So I think as long as the big system
can be somehow made to work with special configuration
and ignoring corner cases that's fine. But for the low 
NUMA systems it should perform as well as possibly out of the box.

That is why I proposed "nearby policy". It can turn a system
with a large NUMA factor into a system with a small NUMA factor.
