Heise.de made it appear, as if the only news was that with tcp
windows, the propability of guessing the right sequence number is not
1:2^32 but something smaller.  They said that 64k packets would be
enough, so guess what the window will be.
Obvious solution would be to use a small window, which would cost
performance.  Different solution would be to use a different window
size for reset, like, say, 1.  Not sure if that would still be
standard, though.
