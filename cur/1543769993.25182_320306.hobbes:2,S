well, here is my first point of disagreement with the many good 
suggestions I have seen. 
I prefer the style as it is, and dislike the return vfs_create(...) 
change. 
First, we're all agreed here that this is a style, not efficiency thing, 
right? Makes no difference, compiler will do what is right. 
The reason I prefer the 'retval = blah blah; return retval;' usage is that
I frequently have run v9fs in UML, and debugging is just easier. Set the
breakpoint in v9fs_vfs_create, step through, maybe skip over that
v9fs_create function, look at retval. Also, should we get to the point
later that we have a debug print of some sort in that function, adding it
is trivial.
I realize there is a preferred style here, but is there room for some 
flexibility?
thanks
