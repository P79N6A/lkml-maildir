Subject: pi-futex: fix mm_struct memory leak
lock_queue was getting called essentially twice in a row and was
continually incrementing the mm_count ref count, thus causing a
memory leak.
Dinakar Guniguntala provided a proper fix for the problem that simply 
grabs the spinlock for the hash bucket queue rather than calling 
lock_queue.
The second time we do a queue_lock in futex_lock_pi, we really only need 
to take the hash bucket lock.
