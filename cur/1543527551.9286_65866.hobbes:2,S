Wouldn't it be nice if everyone did this. Sadly, from experience, I know
that few "professional" website companies do it properly like this.
For a start, most people writing code are really bad at it, and wouldn't
know how to build this setup. 99 out of 100 web programmers are dolts.
Second, people purchase websites based on cost, so developers who ignore
security can sell cheaper, and inevitably they do get more contracts.
Third, far too many customers *expect* to be able to read credit details
of sales via their browser. They go elsewhere when (not if) I say no.
I won't neglect to mention the large Australian web company who not only
has credit card details available on their main web server, but uses IIS
as web server software. I won't say who: the last good samaritan to tell
a large Australian corporation about a gaping security hole was sued.
PS: before somebody tries to steal all the credit details from any of my
websites (!) be forewarned that it's because of the above reasons that I
refuse to do "e-Commerce" for my customers without using third party web
credit card validators. These third parties have the proper setup.
