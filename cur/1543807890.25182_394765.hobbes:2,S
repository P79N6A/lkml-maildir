It isn't too hard to change but it is still the case.  Truth is proc
really doesn't use inodes internally it is just a reporting thing.
So /proc will work but user space might get terribly confused.

So I think as long as this is a kernel implementation things should work ok.
I hate to have user space make assumptions about how many bits are in a pid
though.
