Try to knock out any hardware problems first (run memtest86, check for 
high heat / crappy power).
If you're still having trouble, purchase a serial cable. Plug it into 
another computer with a terminal program. Enable serial console support in 
your kernel (and on your kernel command line). When the kernel boots, use 
SysRq on the serial console to turn the console messaging level up to 
maximum. If you're lucky, you'll catch some sort of diagnostics message on 
the serial console before this happens.
Cheers,
Chase
