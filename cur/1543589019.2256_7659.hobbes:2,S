When upgrading slackware (not a complete reinstall) it doesn't replace you
rc scripts in /etc/rc.d.  2.2.x has a /proc entry to enable forwarding.
You need to echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to enable forwarding.
Newer slackware does this in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2.
I'm not sure this is your problem.  If you installed slackware new without
upgrading this probably isn't the answer.
