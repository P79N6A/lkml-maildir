(I clipped lot's of good reasons why the rc[0-6].d and init.d are a good
idea)
First, Craig... ditto to most of what you said (I too did the SLS to
slackware
path and was sick of trying to restart daemons without having to copy
and
paste the commands from the rc script)
But, you did forget one other advantage.  It is very clean and simple to
add/remove
packages to a running system.
I personally use Redhat, I should probably look at Debian one of these
days when I have free time (*chuckle* -- free time, what's that? :) ).
Being able to add a server process to the machine is something I
couldn't doing again under slackware (haven't used it in years, but if
they still have the rc.M like stuff then my point still stands).
The ability to have packages be independent is one of the things I love
the most about redhat.  install say smupsd.  it doesn't break other
programs even though it taps into init, logrotate, etc...

Steve Roberts
