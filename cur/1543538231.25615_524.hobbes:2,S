Subject: rename/kernel lockup problem in 2.4.0test3-pre2

I ran into this bug running the POSIX.1 test suite.  If you do a:
rename("dir1", "dir2") with dir2 being a mount point and dir1 an empty
directory followed by another rename("dir1", "dir2") (the same
directories) but with dir1 being a mount point instead and dir2 empty
then the kernel locks up.
It appears to be in ext2_panic and ext2_warning. When running the full
test suite I would get the message "EXT2-fs: unable to read
superblock" a little bit before everything froze up.
There are no problems running this on a 2.2.X kernel.
Chris.
