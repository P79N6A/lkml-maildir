I'm trying out 2.6.24-mm1 on my work laptop (T60), and generally it
works surprisingly well (including suspend/resume), with only a few
minor issues.  If these are not known/fixed already, I'll send out
proper bug reports to the relevant people:
 - UML doesn't boot: guest is 2.6.24-mm1 also, haven't tried any
   other.  Same guest boots fine on 2.6.24 host.
 - mounting isofs always results in an empty directory
 - network doesn't always come up at first try (e1000e).  On 2.6.24
   e1000e doesn't seem to work at all, so I use e1000, but that has
   other problems.
 - strange key repeating (short press of a key results in lots of key
   press events) when there's some sort of load (I/O?)  I may have
   seen this on non-mm kernels as well, but it's definitely more
   noticable in -mm
Thanks,
Miklos
