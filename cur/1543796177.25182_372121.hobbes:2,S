Actually, I never said it was a kernel bug :)
I was just wondering what changed between 2.6.14 and 2.6.15-rc2 to break
debian's hotplug/udev packages.
As for another distro? Hmm. I started with Slackware, switched to RedHat
because of the RPMs, toyed with Gentoo (too much work), toyed with SuSE
(too commercial), then left RedHat (because of RPMs!) and have loved
debian since (too much work only when I do too much, like updating a lot
in the unstable release ;)
