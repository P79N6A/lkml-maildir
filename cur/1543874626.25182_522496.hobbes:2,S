One rather general but important comment:
You need to get used to providing smaller, one fix per mail, patches.
As long as the full tree is waiting in -mm, this is not as important,
as I assume that Andrew will fold the whole architecture support into
a big patch before submitting to Linus, but as soon as it's in, such
big patches will not be acceptable any more.
If you're not already doing it, look into how 'quilt' or similar tools
help you with this.
