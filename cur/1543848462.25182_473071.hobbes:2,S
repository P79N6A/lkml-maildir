As usual, we are swamped with bug reports for regressions after -rc1.
For an easier reading (and hoping linux-kernel might not eat the emails), 
I've splitted the list of known regressions in three emails:
  [1/3] known unfixed regressions
  [2/3] knwon regressions with workarounds
  [3/3] known regressions with patches

       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
