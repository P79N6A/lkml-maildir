Another wild guess: the syslog is still running and writes the output to the log.
I had this "problem" with syslog-ng running on 2.6.14.4. The solution was to set syslog-ng to write
to tty1 as well (now moved to tty12 to not scramble other MSGs).
I was seeing just something like "SysRq: memory map" and now I can see the output below that MSG.
Not sure if that was inteded to do so, but I think the output of SysRq+<key> is better send to the
console directly...
