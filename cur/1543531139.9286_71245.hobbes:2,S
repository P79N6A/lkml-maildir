Well, I've traced it down to between 2.3.48pre4 and 2.3.48:
2.3.44-pre8     : GOOD
2.3.47          : GOOD
2.3.48-pre1     : Can't mount hdb partitions
2.3.48-pre2     : Can't mount hdb partitions
2.3.48-pre3     : Doesn't boot
2.3.48-pre4     : GOOD (heavily tested)
2.3.48          : BAD
2.3.50          : BAD
2.3.51          : BAD
2.3.99-pre1     : BAD
2.3.99-pre2pre4 : BAD
2.3.99-pre2     : BAD
2.3.99-pre3pre3 : BAD
Looking at the 2.3.48pre4-2.3.48 diff, I see there are a huge amount of
changes (as usual).  Some IDE changes, but there are quite a few other
places that I look like they could be causing this.
I made a copy of the 2.3.48pre4-2.3.48 diff available here:

Anybody see what could be doing it?
- hdparm -u 1 vs hdparm -u 0 on all drives does not seem to make a
  difference.
- hdparm -d 0 vs hdparm -d 1 on all drives tends to make the problem
  happen even more often (guessing 5 times as often).  Tested with
  both -u 1 and -u 0.
