Hello,
   I've just rebuilt my 2.6.8 kernel to enable SMP for my dual Xeons. 
Everything seems to work great, except now smbfs is broken.  If I boot 
the non-SMP kernel, smbfs works perfectly; however, if I boot the SMP 
kernel, most file creations/modifications in smbfs-mounted directories 
hang for a long time and end with errors such as the following example:
/home/me/smb/mounted/dir: $ touch testfile
touch: setting times of `testfile': Input/output error
/home/me/smb/mounted/dir: $ rm testfile
/home/me/smb/mounted/dir: $ echo "Hello, Dave." | cat > testfile
/home/me/smb/mounted/dir: $ cat testfile
Hello, Dave.
/home/me/smb/mounted/dir: $ echo "I'm scared, Dave." | cat > testfile
bash: testfile: Input/output error
/home/me/smb/mounted/dir: $ cat testfile
/home/me/smb/mounted/dir: $ ls -l testfile
-rwxr--r--  1 me root 0 2005-01-17 09:50 testfile
Now that I am aware of the problem, I know to avoid triggering it, but 
imagine my dismay when, after attempting to save an edited file, I found 
that its size had been reduced to zero!
   I'm a kernel-building newbie, so I'm sure my problem is due to me 
overlooking something.  I tried building smbfs into the kernel, but that 
made no difference.  I'd be ever thankful if someone would point me in 
the right direction, as I would certainly enjoy fully using my 
processors while also being able to use smbfs.
Other potentially pertinent data:
Distro: Debian Sarge
Kernel Version: 2.6.8 custom
Arch: Xeon-HT/EMT (x2)
Thanks in advance!
Regards,
~Brian
