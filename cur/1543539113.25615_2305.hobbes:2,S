NEC Versa SX laptop, ricoh rl5c478 cardbus controller
test1 works with pcmcia cards.  when I insert a cardbus card, it gives me:
PCI: Guessed IRQ 10 for device 01:00.0
PCI: The same IRQ used for device 00:02.0
PCI: The same IRQ used for device 00:03.0
and fails to work.
test4 locks up after finding cardbus controller.  sysrq doesn't work since
it's disabled at boot up =(  (I wish it wasn't on boot)
