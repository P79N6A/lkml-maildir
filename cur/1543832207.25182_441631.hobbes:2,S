It would be very hard to do so. Almost anything can and (alas) did have
sata bridges nailed to it early on. Almost every later highpoint,
promise and ati chip has been found with SATA bridges attached.
I've tried to follow the convention on the basis of "not usually found
nailed to a SATA bridge chip". If we want to be strict then most of
pata_ is ata_ and the prefix really isn't useful.
Easy move to make and submit but is it actually useful to do so ?
And what about IDE/SATA convertor boards ?
