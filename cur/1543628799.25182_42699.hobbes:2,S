IA64 support for 2.5.10-ia64-020426 is now available.
Sebastian Droege spotted an error in the common patch, common-2
corrects zlib de/inflate options.
Because ia64 has a pathological case of recursive includes (you cannot
calculate the value of IA64_TASK_SIZE unless you already have a value
for IA64_TASK_SIZE), I had to kludge the calculation of asm-offsets.h
for ia64.  That required a small change to the core code to support the
kludge.
New files.
