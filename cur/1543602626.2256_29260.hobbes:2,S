Oh dear, dear, dear.  That was careless wasn't it....
In fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c
 in decode_pathname
  change "xdr_decode_string_inplace" to "xdr_decode_string".
This won't affect NFSv2, only v3.
I would like to use the "_inplace" version, but "vfs_symlink" doesn't
take a length argument for the symlink, and _inplace cannot nul
terminate.
