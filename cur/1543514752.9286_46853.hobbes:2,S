What do you mean by incestuous -- if you mean that they depend on it,
you're thinking of things in the wrong way.  Think of the buffer_head as a
block io tag.  The block drivers themselves don't interact with the buffer
cache, they interact with requests.

So you're incapable of making use of b_end_io to complete an async io
request?  Wow.
