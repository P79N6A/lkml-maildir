Sure. The mey is:
 - we can more easily fix the f*cking filesystems to be sane
 - then trying to add prescient read-ahead to the kernel
In other words, trying to do an impossibly good job on read-ahead is 
_stupid_, when the real problem is that ext2 lays out files in total crap 
ways.

But why do the horribly stupid thing, when Andrew has already shown that a
one-liner change to ext2/3 gives you platter speeds (and better speeds
than your approach _can_ get, since you still are going to end up seeking
a lot, even if you can make your read-ahead prescient).
In other words, you're overcompensating.
