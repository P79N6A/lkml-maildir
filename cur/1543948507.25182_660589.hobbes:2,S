This series of patches is made in purpose to use PAGE_SIZE and THREAD_SIZE
macroses in vmlinux linker scripts as much as possible instead of numeric
constants. Please review.
        WARNING: the patches are UNTESTED COMPLETELY - I've no access to
        that architectures and errors is highly possible ;)
	If you have an ability to test this patches - please do it.
	What is most important on review - these macroses *must* be
	placed into appropriate places - check it please.
	ANY comments are welcome.
