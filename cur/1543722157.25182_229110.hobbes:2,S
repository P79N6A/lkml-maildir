Subject: BUG?:   G5 not using all available memory

I've got a G5 with 2GB of memory, running 2.6.7, ppc architecture (not ppc64), 
with the following config options (let me know if others are relevent)
# CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL is not set
#
# Advanced setup
#
CONFIG_ADVANCED_OPTIONS=y
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM_START_BOOL is not set
CONFIG_HIGHMEM_START=0xfe000000
# CONFIG_LOWMEM_SIZE_BOOL is not set
CONFIG_LOWMEM_SIZE=0x30000000
# CONFIG_KERNEL_START_BOOL is not set
CONFIG_KERNEL_START=0xc0000000
After boot, I get the following output in dmesg:
Memory: 510080k available (3144k kernel code, 1532k data, 168k init, 0k highmem)
What's going on?  Why can't I see all my memory?
Chris
