I usually just point to the gnucash 1.6 release as where this sort of thing 
leads if you ignore it long enough:
http://lwn.net/2001/0614/
These days, a more modern example is the way that after even the gentoo folks 
gave up on trying to build openoffice (and shipped prebuilt binaries of it in 
their "build everything from source code" OS), Open Office's own developers 
described that project "profoundly sick" and "stagnating" ( 
http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/12/28/0124230
 ).
Neither project _started_ with an inbred development community that presented 
a brick wall to new developers.  Complexity grew because they didn't fight 
against it, and because they didn't have good rules by which they could say 
"no" to any.
Environmental dependencies in your build environment are a cost, and as with 
all costs it's ok if you get enough in return for it.  The Linux kernel has 
historically been extremely lean in this regard, and discarding that strength 
should at the very least come with commensurate concrete benefits.
