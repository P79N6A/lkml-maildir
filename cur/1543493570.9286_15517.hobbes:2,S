 I did something similar a couple months ago - got a ASUS P5A, K6-2 400. I
used my Diamond Stealth 64 DRAM (Trio 64) card. (At least, until my
birthday, I hope. :-> )

 I haven't seen this problem. What is the name and model of your card?
Send me your XF86Config and I'll see if it differs in some significant way
from mine.

 Hmmm. That really points to a hardware issue; mine works fine in both
Linux and Windows. A few things to try:
 1. Make sure the monitor cable is attached properly. (unlikely, but
    hey...)
 2. Make sure the card is seated firmly in the PCI slot.
 3. Try moving the card to a different PCI slot.
 4. Check the BIOS, and disable any type of "Shadowing".

 Well, Trio64's are not exactly top-of-the-line these days, but it *ought*
to work. Mine does, for what I need it to do.
