OK, that makes sense.  Can you include that in the patch description?

Oh, yeah, none of what I was suggesting belongs in this patch.  But,
they'd make good followups.  I was just trying to get you to look at
what caused that bug to be introduced in the first place.

So, (total - free) equals the number of MAP_PRIVATE pages?  Does that
imply that all reserved pages are shared and that all shared pages are
reserved?
This would be clearer even with
static inline int nr_map_private_hpages(void)
{
	return total - free;
}
Especially, if we could get the "shared" name somewhere into the
reserved variable.  
It makes a whole ton of sense to see:
	int total_in_use = nr_shared() + nr_private();
	if (nr_requested_pages < total_in_use)
		uh_oh_cant_do_that();
That'd be a wonderful cleanup.

Yes.  I'm just starting to get the idea that pages are committed in
different ways.  So, it makes good sense to have a nice function like
total_committed_hpages(), which explains all of this, and is called to
compare agaist the evil "count" variable. :)
