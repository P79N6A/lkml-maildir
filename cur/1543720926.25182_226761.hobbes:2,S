You are not unusual at all. I switched from 2.4 kernels to 2.6 several 
months ago, and yet I still have production boxes running 2.2 
kernels... Not that changing kernel code would affect me, since those 
boxes are also running 4 year old kernels... And no, I won't tell you 
their IP's ;-)

It is also worth pointing out that "linux" (aka the kernel) is quite 
different from *BSD, especially with OpenBSD, it should be more 
properly compared to a distribution, and most distributions do run on a 
different release cycle than does Linus.
