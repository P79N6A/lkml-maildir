   Yes, but follow this logic.
1)You are willing to devote 10% of 2Ghz xeon to software raid.
2)A $500+ controller has a 100Mhz proccessor.
   Thus just from this you could guess that software raid has x2 as many 
clock cycles availble to it.  It's even worse when you realize the 2Ghz 
xeon is a better proccessor in many more ways than just clock cycles.
   The reasons to use that 500-1000 raid controller are due the features 
the controller gives you.  Things like gracefull recovery from bad 
sectors, and SAF-TE support.
