no, it's not a good idea for the reason i described: 1) extensibility of
the code itself (you can easily change a waitqueue-based code to
multiple-threads, you cannot do it with the wake_up_process() variant) 2)
wake_up_process() is a scheduler-internal function and optimizations that
go into waitqueues will not necesserily show up in wake_up_process(). As
of 2.4.0-test7 you are right, but it's IMHO shortsighted.
