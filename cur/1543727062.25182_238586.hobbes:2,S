Yes. I'm not trying to give drivers an inconsistent state, just delaying
suspending some until the last minute....
Suspend 2 algorithm:
1. Prepare image (freeze processes, allocate memory, eat memory etc)
2. Power down all drivers not used while writing image
3. Write LRU pages. ('pageset 2')
4. Quiesce remaining drivers, save CPU state, to atomic copy of
remaining ram.
5. Resume quiesced drivers.
6. Write atomic copy.
7. Power down used drivers.
8. Enter S4 if ACPI enabled; otherwise reboot or power down.
