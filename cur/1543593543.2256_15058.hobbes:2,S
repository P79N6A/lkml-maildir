Then again, maybe someone has a reason to use a different
TCP stack, ie to support something like a high-availiblity stack
between two different machines...
Why would you be scared of a proprietary  TCP stack?  If Open Source
is so much better (and I believe it is), then there would be nothing
to lose.  And if the new stack helped a small subset of people who would
otherwise have an even sorrier life implementing it on some other
platform, then that is better, right?
