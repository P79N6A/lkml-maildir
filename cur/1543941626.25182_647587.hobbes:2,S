Actually, Greg, a hell of a lot of people that don't track linux kernel 
development do think that way. And there are always going to be people that 
think that way.
As it stands the recommended paragraph does clarify that, while the interfaces 
aren't stable, can and will change as needed, there are some core interfaces 
that *WON'T* change without a very good reason. Having such a public 
statement that anyone can see and people can point to is another weapon to 
help people fight the FUD that exists around Linux.
DRH
(And yes, I do fight anti-linux FUD all the time. My parents have been using 
my laptops and can actually be quoted as saying that the next computer they 
buy will run Linux! My family mostly runs Windows - my brothers because their 
kids would complain about not being able to play their games and my sister 
because her husband is so computer illiterate I'm amazed he actually knows 
how to do a Google search)
