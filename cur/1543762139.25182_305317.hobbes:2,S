Hi,all:
This is my memory status from "dmesg":
Memory: 4673020k/5242880k available (1334k kernel code, 44532k reserved, 
672k data, 156k init, 3800960k highmem)
But I found that available memory size is much less than physical memory 
size.My server is Dell6650 with P4 Xeon*4 and 5G Ram.
My kernel version is 2.6.12-rc1-mm1.Could any one tell my the reason?Thanks.
