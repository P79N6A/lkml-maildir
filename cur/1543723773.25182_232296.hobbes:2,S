The "_syscallx" macros are in the userspace versions of the kernel headers, and 
as such should be fair game.  Also, you need to get a list of syscall numbers 
somehow, and those numbers are generally defined in the same file that contains 
the "_syscallx" macros.
syscall() doesn't work for all system calls.  The man page explicitly warns that 
it doesn't work for pipe(2).  Interestingly, the glibc manual doesn't have that 
warning.  Wonder which is correct...
