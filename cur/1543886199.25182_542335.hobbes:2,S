There might be a way ... by having the flags manipulation always
atomically deal with PG_locked and PG_waiters together. This is possible
but we would need even more weirdo bitops abstractions from the arch I'm
afraid... unless we start using atomic_* rather that bitops in order to
manipulate multiple bits at a time.
