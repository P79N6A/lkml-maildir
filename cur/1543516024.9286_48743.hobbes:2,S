the shm limits are sysctl'able in recent 2.2 and 2.3 kernel, but both
use a different sysctl:
2.3 stores all limits in SHMMAX; 2.2 uses 2 sysctl's (SHMMAX and SHMALL)
for these limits.
I prefer the the 2.2 solution (SHMMAX must be 'size_t', SHMALL and
SHMMNI should be 'int'), any complains if I change the sysctl's of 2.3?
