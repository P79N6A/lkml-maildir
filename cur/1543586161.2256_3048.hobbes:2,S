inode with ->i_bdev == 0x20000. Very likely to be a one-bit memory
corruption. May be hardware, may be not - unfortunately, all we know
is that bit 18 in that word had been flipped. Whatever had done that
had no idea that word stores the pointer - that's for sure...
Check the memory - it _may_ be a hardware problem.
