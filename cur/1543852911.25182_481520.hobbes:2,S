No, I do not have any compelling technical reason; I was just going via more 
or less permanent .config cleanup round and was surprised why it did not work 
because it did work before (but it was really long ago, I guess in late 2.5 
times). When I tried it last time I was mostly driven by attempt to minimize 
kernel size so it fitted for floppy boot. Since then it became less 
interesting (it is probably won't fit anymore and distribution I use dropped 
floppy boot support anyway).
Thank you (and Russel) for explanation and sorry if it was too trivial 
question.
