Just a workaround that could possibly avoid a crash during the boot-up:
IRQ 9 is most probably the reason for those crashes; so try to find
out where you can put an irq list (without that irq 9) into:
Under redhat 5.2 (running on my toshiba 2520) it is
/etc/sysconfig/pcmcia:
PCMCIA=yes
PCIC=i82365
PCIC_OPTS="irq_list=4,6,8,10,11 pci_csc=1 pc_debug=128"
Editing this file is able by booting a floppy linux; maybe suse have
some rescue disks or something like that.
Bye, Juergen.
