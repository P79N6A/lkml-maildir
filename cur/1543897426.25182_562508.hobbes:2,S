That's complete bullshit.

That's even more nonsense, that wasn't what my mail was about and Andrew 
understood me correctly, so you could have too.
Ingo, I at least know that I'm difficult to deal with and try to take this 
into account, which is hard for me, but you don't even seem to know what 
kind of ass you are towards people who don't suck up to you (I guess you 
simply get away with it far too often).
