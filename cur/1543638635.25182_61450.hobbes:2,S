Not so. USB Mouse works just fine here on 2.4.19.
$ lsmod
....
mousedev                4352   1
hid                    14112   0 (unused)
input                   3328   0 [mousedev hid]
....
CONFIG_INPUT=m
# CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV is not set
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=m
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X=1280
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y=1024
CONFIG_USB_HID=m
CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
# CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV is not set
'cat /dev/input/mice' (a cat and mouse game?) gives output as well.
So there appears to be no generic 2.4.19 problem.
