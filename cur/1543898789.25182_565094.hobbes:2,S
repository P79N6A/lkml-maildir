In our test, we confirmed that this can be fixed by flushing L2I just before 
SetPageUptodate() in NFS.

IMHO, for example, race in cooy-on-write  (was fixed by Tony Luck) has to be
fixed by MemoryManagement layer.
And only a race in do_no_page() seems to be able to be fixed by FS layer.
BTW, can we know whether a page is filled by DMA or not  ?
