Applied to my linux-next branch, thanks.  Btw, I've seen quite a few of these 
Coccinelle related patches fly by, but I haven't seen an introduction of the 
tool posted to lkml.  Did I miss it?  Or maybe it just went to the janitors 
list?  If not, it seems like it might be a worthwhile thing to describe for 
people...
