I'll give it a go.  But first I ought to try to reproduce the problem
more easily - it happened after about two hours of a test which had run
for two or more hours (before hitting the apparently unrelated problem)
at least twice each on at least two machines.  So until I can reproduce
the problem more easily, it'll take some while to have confidence that
your patch addresses it.  Therefore worth a little effort at my end to
cut it down (and if I can't cut it down, I may have to solve the odder
locked page issue to get the original test to run long enough to hit
the file-max problem with any likelihood).

It'll waste less of both our time if I at least try to reproduce it
more quickly first.  Hold on...
