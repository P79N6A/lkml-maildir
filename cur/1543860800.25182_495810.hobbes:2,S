PowerPC kills OF because it really has to, that's one of numerous
reasons that it started sucking the device tree into a kernel copy
early in the bootup and using that for device discovery etc.
To be honest, the 'ok' prompt is of limited value when you have
things like Alt-SysRq and PPC's XMON debugger in the kernel already.
In fact, the 'ok' prompt is an ENORMOUS pain in the ass to support
on machines with USB keyboards, because sharing the USB host
controller is beyond non-trivial.  I've never implemented support
for that on sparc64 and I frankly have no desire to do the work
necessary to support that.  It simply is not worth it.
