This is fairly pointless - it'll just break again when Adam moves again.
Every problem can be solved with another layer of...
Please: just replace all instances with plain old "Adam Fritzler" and then
ensure that the lookup key "Adam Fritzler" has an accurate (and
non-duplicated anywhere else!) entry in MAINTAINERS or CREDITS or whatever.
btw, I cheerfully skipped all your spelling-fixes patches.  Some will have
stuck via subsystem maintainers but I have a secret "no spelling fixes
unless they're end-user-visible" policy.  That means I'll take spelling
fixes only if they're in printks or in Documentation/*.  This is a little
defense mechanism to avoid getting buried in micropatches.
I'd suggest that you find out if Adrian is still running the trivial tree
and if so, patchbomb him.
