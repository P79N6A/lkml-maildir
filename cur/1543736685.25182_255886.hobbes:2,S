The current way pads out the structure unnecessarily, and still doesn't
handle the really long filenames, by your admission. It incurs extra
syscalls, as few filenames are really 256 characters in length. It makes
userspace double-check whether the filename extends all the way to the
boundary of the structure, and if so, then go back to the disk to try to
guess what the kernel really meant to say.
My way, doing a kmalloc of either the entire structure + filename length
+ NUL, or just the filename + NUL makes userspace infinitesimally
trickier to write. There's more effort in just getting the error
handling correct in either version.
The current way viewed by userspace, stolen shamelessly from the beagle
source:
    /* FIXME: We need to check for errors, etc. */
    remaining = sizeof (struct inotify_event);
    event_buffer = (char *) &event;
    while (remaining > 0) {
        num_bytes = read (fd, event_buffer, remaining);
        event_buffer += num_bytes;
        remaining -= num_bytes;
    }
My way (where struct inotify_event is declared with a char filename[0]
at the end):
    if ((n=read(fd, buf, sizeof buf)) > 0) {
	unsigned offset=0;
        while (n > 0) {
            // inotify guarantees complete events 
            unsigned len = sizeof(struct inotify_event);
            dispatch((struct inotify_event *) &buf[offset]);
            len += strlen(buf[offset + len]) + 1;
            n -= len;
            offset += len;
        }
    }
Doesn't seem all that tricky.
I'm willing to believe that I'm missing something. Help me see what.
