just a hint: this is near the first piece of code that makes active use 
of a timer wakeup, on a typical x86 bootup. So sometimes if timers are 
not working at all, hangs happen around here. But the PCI related thing 
you suspect could be the reason too. Getting a SysRq-T or an NMI 
printout (if that's possible) of the hung site would be nice.
