	   The instruction format expects 3+1 longwords (32-bits each)
	   worth of instruction stream data, and although its ways to
	   explicitely combine integer and float instructions are more
	   versatile (=complicated) than what DEC 21264 Alpha can do,
	   it can barely match said Alpha processor in speed of
	   instructions per clock cycle.  (That alpha can do up to
	   2i+2fp instructions per clock.)
You have precluded the possibility of dispatching multiple bundles per
clock cycle, and I am rather sure this will be a characteristic of
various EPIC processors.  Especially because the bundling simplifies
the multi-issue logic in the instruction prefetcher (one possible
implementation could be to compress the bit patterns of the bundle
types into some "hash key" like code, and use CAM memory to lookup the
decision of which of the bundles can be sent in parallel to the
execution units, and perhaps also _which_ execution units).
If people want my own personal opinion about this chips design (too
bad, you're going to get it anyways :-) I view it as a set of powerful
core ideas (most likely from the HP camp) with several terrible hacks
thrown on top (which, if not done by HP... :-)
