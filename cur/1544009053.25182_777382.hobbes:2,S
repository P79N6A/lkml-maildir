Right, the pagevecs are per-cpu, independent from any CONFIG_NUMA
settings, and this is exactly why I would expect that lru_add_drain_all()
works on all cpus, as opposed to lru_add_drain() which works only on
the current cpu.

Good question, there are only a few other users and most of them were
added just recently with the unevictable lru patches. The only exception
is migrate_prep(), but this is only called from sys_move_pages(), which
is not implemented w/o CONFIG_NUMA afaik.
As explained above, the per-cpu pagevec layout should be independent
from NUMA or UNEVICTABLE_LRU, so I guess the right thing to do here
is completely remove the #ifdef as in the patch from Kosaki Motohiro
(or at least replace it with a CONFIG_SMP as suggested by Kamezawa
Hiroyuki).
Thanks,
