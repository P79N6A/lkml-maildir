I've been a little distracted recently - sorry. I'll re-read the thread and see 
if there are any test actions I need to complete.
I do know that the corruption problems I've been having:
a) only happen after hibernate/resume
b) only ever happen on one of 2 XFS filesystems
c) happen even when the script does xfs_freeze;sync;hibernate;xfs_thaw
What happens if a filesystem is frozen and I hibernate?
Will it be thawed when I resume?
