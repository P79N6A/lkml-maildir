Hi !
We've got a little Linux box based on P100 with a mono hercules monitor.
I've noticed that scrolling the screen can completly locks the machine
while scrolling is proceed. I was playing an MP3 and paging witin 'less'
produces strange sound output. If I scroll continously I can 'stop' mp3
playing for seconds as well. mpg123 ran with -20 and realtime priority ...
What's the matter ? It's not issued with eg a VGA card ...
Thanks: Gabor,
