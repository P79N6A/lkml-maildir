One thing that should not be forgotten is the risk of trojan horses
here, in practice the Makefile is a shell script, so to apply any
patch and the compile with it would be a bit dangerous.  It might be
possible to limit the patchbot to only accept code changes, but 
that might remove most of the benefits.  Also, I don't know how much
magic one might do with a properly crafted #include statement, such 
as "#include /etc/passwd" and then the error message will contain
the encypted password for root (shadow passwords fix this specific
problem, but you get the idea :-)
