At the risk of prolonging things... :-(
Isn't the fundamental problem here that the ssb driver claims the same
PCI IDs as the bcm43xx driver?  He have hit this same issue a number
of times: 8139too vs.  8139cp, eepro vs. e100, sk98lin vs. skge,
and I'm sure there are more.  I admit that this situation is a bit
more confusing, since the user is less likely to predict a conflict
between bcm43xx and the ssb driver.  This is especially true since
the user isn't even selecting ssb directly, but is instead selecting
the apparently unrelated b44.
Still, the bcm43xx driver is not fundamentally damaged.  This is
fundamentally a "two drivers claiming the same PCI ID" issue, not a
"you broke my driver" one.
