That's just it though...sched_yield() with SCHED_OTHER doesn't have well 
defined semantics, so we can do just about anything we want.
The issue is mostly how to work around existing apps that (invalidly) 
expect certain behaviour from sched_yield().

CFS doesn't really do "timeslice".  But in essence what you are 
describing is the default behaviour currently...it simply removes the 
task from the tree and reinserts it based on how much cpu time it used up.

It gets reinserted into the tree at a position based on how much cpu 
time it used.  This is exactly the current sched_yield() behaviour.

The scheduler still doesn't know specifically what the task is waiting for.

Technically, all of SCHED_OTHER has static priority level zero.  Thus 
the "right" thing to do is to allow all SCHED_OTHER tasks to run, 
including the ones with the highst possible nice level.
This is the alternate implementation in the current code, but it has 
latency implications that may be unexpected by applications written for 
the previous 2.6 behaviour.
