Also, in that thread you cite (__warn_once && (condition)) is flat-out 
wrong, because condition may have a side-effect.  There are plenty of 
places in the code which use BUG_ON or WARN_ON as a general error 
checking mechanism which expect the condition to be always evaluated 
once; WARN_ON_ONCE should be the same.
Personally I think it is poor style, but there you are.
