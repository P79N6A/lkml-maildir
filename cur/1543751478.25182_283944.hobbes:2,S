False positives are ok with instructions that trap - if it traps, we won't 
much care, since the debugger will get notified about that separately (and 
unambiguously).

I don't think either of those are necessarily true on older x86 chips. 
Nonsensical prefixes used to be silently ignored. Only in later chips has 
Intel been more strict about them, and given them meanings.
In fact, I'm pretty sure it's only "lock" that Intel got a lot more
careful about.  Try it. I'm pretty sure a "rep" prefix is still accepted
in front of pretty much all instructions. It just doesn't do anything.
Is it used? Probably not. But people have done some strange things to 
"mark" instructions (ie for things like run-time exception handling you 
can "mark" an instruction by prefixing it with a nonsensical "rep" prefix: 
the CPU won't care, and you can check at trap time whether it was one of 
your magic instructions.
Of course, I'd never admit to doing anything that obscure. Never.
