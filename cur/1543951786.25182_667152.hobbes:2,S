And lets now get back to reality - the reality that now breaks the
previously working setup of lots of users. So you are telling me that in
order to get my volume key functionality back I have to get rid of HAL
and X?
Lets turn back time a bit. Why was this change made? IOW, what was the
reason for breaking a working setup for lots of users? It better be a
damn good reason, or I would heavily argue for reverting this change so
that 2.6.25 actually WORKS as expected for thinkpad users.
