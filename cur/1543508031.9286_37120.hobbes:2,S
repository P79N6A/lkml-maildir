Not hard pushed at all. The problem is that both cpus have caches. So
suppose you have two static variables:
static char A;
static char B;
 variable A is accessed often by thread 1, variable B is accessed often by
 thread 2. (if you want something more tangible, imagine that each thread
is computing a checksum of it's own array and these variables keep the
result - this is just for the sake of the argument).
 Now on UP system each thread will take approximately half the cycles
available. On SMP system threads will do same if scheduled to one cpu, but
will do considerably worse when scheduled to two different cpus.
 As pointed by Mark Hans to me ia32 has 32byte cache lines. Thus if the
above example gets compiled so that variables A and B are further than 32
bytes apart all is ok and no perfomance loss is expected. However if they
are close (as they should be) each time the threads run on two different
cpus making you are limited to FSB speed.
 Note that the same behaviour will happen even when variables are declared
long. I would also imagine that on a system with only one cpu-intensive 
multi-threaded program running you'll get a slowdown as opposed to the
case when you start any other program that will take that cpu from you.
(say a while(1) loop).
