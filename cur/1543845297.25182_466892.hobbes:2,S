I agree, it is a pain :)
And I don't use git for patch maintenance, only for sending stuff to
Linus.  So I'd have to pull this and extract out the patches and edit
the headers in order to get them into my tree in mbox form (as my
patchflow works off of emails.)
So, care to make it a bit easier for me to take these?
