Could be.  I'm surprised that they need a glue layer at all actually.

Well I think that restructuring the pagecache invalidaton in such a way
that it is useful for non-derived clustered filesytems does give one some
rights to actually use that code.  It seems a bit rude to take the code but
to make it unusable.

Well if people have problems with it then I don't feel strongly enough
about it to dispute that, frankly.
But I do not think that making a single kernel symbol inaccessible is an
appropriate way of resolving a GPFS licensing dispute.
