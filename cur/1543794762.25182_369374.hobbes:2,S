Sorry, I don't know much about the definition of major/minor page faults.
So I googled one that explains the old behavior:
--> Page Faults <--
These come in two varieties. Minor and Major faults. A Major fault results
when an application tries to access a memory page that has been swapped out to
disk. The page must be swapped back in. A Minor fault results when an
application tries to access a memory page that is still in memory, but the
physical location of which is not immediately known. The address must be
looked up.
With the current accounting logic:
- major faults reflect the times one has to wait for real I/O.
- the more success read-ahead, the less major faults.
- anyway, major+minor faults remain the same for the same benchmark.
With your patch:
- major faults are expected to remain the same with whatever read-ahead.
- but what's the new meaning of minor faults?
Thanks,
Wu
