As the message says, your system loses timer interrupts (clock ticks)  
compared to the CPU-internal Time Stamp Counter. This is probably due to
the old harddrive disabling interrupts for too long a time.
Since the wall clock and the TSC differ, the kernel has to decide which 
time source to trust. Current kernels choose the timer interrupt (this 
might change in the future), which in your case is just the wrong 
decision.

Yep, since the culprit is removed that turned interrupts off for long 
intervals.

This is again explained by your system losing clock ticks. It just shows 
how bad the situation was: on average it seems to lose every other clock 
tick.
What happens if you turn interrupt unmasking on for your old drive? 
(hdparm -u1 /dev/hda)
BEWARE: rare chance of data corruption ahead, better mount the drive 
read-only before doing so.
This should give your system the chance to catch many more timer 
interrupts.
Easiest solution, of course, is to just retire the old drive.
Hope this explains your findings,
Tim
