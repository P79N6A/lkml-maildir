The best option might be to just take a chance on breaking things - if
userspace is so fragile that an extra sound device appearing breaks
things, it could also be broken merely by adding a new driver to the
kernel.  If we have to worry about this kind of breakage the "no
incompatible changes" policy becomes "no new features".
That's my $0.02, it's between the patch author and the maintainer what
you want to do.
