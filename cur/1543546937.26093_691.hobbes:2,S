Probably... ISTR that there was a long-living spinlock somewhere in mm/*.c,
but you are more familiar with that area...

I can't think of any places where we actually did that, but... it's a
pretty weak warranty ;-/  I've seen a lot of amazingly dumb things
happening and "nobody sane would do that" doesn't replace the analysis -
there's always somebody who wanted to be smart.
VFS _generally_ releases the spinlocks before calling methods (and rules
are described in Documentation/filesystems/Locking), so I think that it's
OK (very easy to verify, anyway), but VM can be scarier and I don't want
even think about drivers... Network stuff seems to be relatively BKL-free.
Architecture-dependent stuff... Hell knows.

We probably want, but that will require catching them. It should be easier
now (in almost all cases we have a chance to block very soon after the
lock_kernel(), so areas to look into shouldn't be that large), but I'm not
too happy about making the change without doing their analysis - it will
be needed anyway and doing it now over the whole tree would be easier than
doing it piece-wise later.
Essentially, you are adding tons of scheduling points all over the tree
and it's not a thing to make blindly...
