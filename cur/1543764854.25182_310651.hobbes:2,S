  Yes, this seems to be a better long-term solution. A hotfix (retrying
after __flush_batch()) is attached if somebody is interested - it should
be safe and is lightly tested.

  Yes, AFAICS the changes should remain local to the checkpointing code
(plus __unlink_buffer()). Should I write the patch or will you?
