Looks like you guys could use nonatomic versions to improve bus  
efficiency slightly, but they appear to be relying on the fact that  
when the function calling set_bit() returns, the multicast thread  
will be guaranteed to be finished and never run again.  The set_bit()  
can only happen when the thread is not doing work (due to the lock),  
and since the thread firsts checks the bit before doing any work, it  
provides more guarantees than just the atomics would.
