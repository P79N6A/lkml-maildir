I spend a lot of time deleting spam from the mailing lists I
archive. The kernel list gets a lot of spam--it's just not
as obvious as it is on some lists because of the large amount
of legit traffic. Some of the slower lists get nothing but
spam for weeks at a time.
While bogofilter may not be the answer, doing something may
be quite desirable.
