I was going to suggest this, except I couldn't figure out what to
suggest that it look like... I finally figured that the value could be
cast, or wrapped in a union by userspace (although theoretically, this
might mean more words than absolutely necessary to initialize on a
32-bit CPU...)
What were you thinking? 1X64 bit or 2X32 bit?
