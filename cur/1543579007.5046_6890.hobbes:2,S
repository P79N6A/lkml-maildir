Hello,
When I discovered the nice "smp affinity" feature, I gave it a try on our
old SMP testbed (quad P100 with 2 Adaptec AIC-7870 SCSI adapters).  And by
chance, I discovered that the following command causes an oops (after a
couple of seconds), even without any kind of smp affinity :
[root@picasso /]# dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null
Fortunately I had kdb and the console on a serial line :
<some random characters>
Entering kdb (current=0xc116e000, pid 0) on processor 3 Panic: Oops

This is a 2.4.0 (release) with kdb 1.7 for 2.4.0. I tried the same on a
similar machine with 2 CPUs and without kdb, it gave the same result. A
2.4.0 without SMP support on these machines has no problem.
Can anyone reproduce this ? Or maybe it has already been fixed ?
