Subject: Turning off LBA48

I'm running kernel 2.4.26, and I have a specific need to be able to turn 
off LBA48 support on a per-device basis. Specifically, I need such 
drives to appear with a capacity of ~137GB as they would if there were 
no LBA48 support. Below is a small patch that I applied to this kernel 
to accomplish the goal. Some cursory tests indicate that it works in my 
configuration, but I may have broken some taboos. I didn't know if there 
were non-obvious side effects to increasing the size of the ide_drive_t 
struct, so I renamed an existing and (apparently) unused flag. I also 
exposed a new kernel command line option ("hdx=nolba48"); this seems to 
add to a very small list, so obviously additions aren't taken lightly.
Does anyone else see value (or danger!) in this or a similar patch? The 
reason I need it: I use this machine to manipulate hard drives for other 
machines that aren't LBA48 aware. In the case of a >137GB, it's fine to 
let the machine (TiVo) just see the first 137GB.
Thanks!
Brad
