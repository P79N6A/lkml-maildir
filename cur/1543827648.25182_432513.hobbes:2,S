I think you have missed the point of the code here.  There are two
SPARSEMEM variants; STATIC and EXTREME.  The key point is that STATIC
was the original and only variant.  EXTREME is a later variant.
In the static case the section map is defined as:
  struct mem_section mem_section[NR_SECTION_ROOTS][SECTIONS_PER_ROOT]
Where the NR_SECTION_ROOTS is always 1 allowing greater code sharing
between the two modes.  This the the primary and default variant.
In the extreme case it is defined as:
  struct mem_section *mem_section[NR_SECTION_ROOTS]
The key difference is that in EXTREME the second level is not allocated
statically, they are allocated as sections are discovered and
initialised.  The sparse_index_alloc routine is a SPARSEMEM hook to give
 variants the oppotunity to prepare for an area of sections to be used.
The EXTREME variant is using this hook to allocate the second levels as
it goes thus only populating those it is using; which is its key feature.
If we look at the definition in question, this is describing this
relationship exactly.  If we have EXTREME variant turned on then use the
alloc_bootmem_node to init the section root, else use the default
behaviour from the default variant STATIC.
  #ifdef CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME
  static struct mem_section *sparse_index_alloc(int nid)
  {
         return alloc_bootmem_node(...);
  }
  #else
  static struct mem_section *sparse_index_alloc(int nid)
  {
         return 0;
  }
  #endif
This would be even more clear should a third variant MAGIC be added
where we would have:
  #ifdef CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_MAGIC
  static struct mem_section *sparse_index_alloc(int nid)
  {
         return wave_wand();
  }
  #elif defined(CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME)
  static struct mem_section *sparse_index_alloc(int nid)
  {
         return alloc_bootmem_node(...);
  }
  #else
  static struct mem_section *sparse_index_alloc(int nid)
  {
         return 0;
  }
  #endif
If this was changed to an #ifndef we would be talking about something like:
  #if !defined(SPARSEMEM_EXTREME) && !defined(SPARSEMEM_STATIC)
  ... magic case
  #elif !defined(SPARSMEM_MAGIC) && !defined(SPARSMEM_STATIC)
  ... extreme case
  #else
  ... default case
  #endif
I think we can agree this is not clearer.
