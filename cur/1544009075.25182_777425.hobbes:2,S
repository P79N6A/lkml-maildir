Yeah, it certainly seems fairly unorthodox, alright. But then again,
virtio_pci is an odd creature anyway :-)
My thinking was that the virtio abstraction is preventing there being an
explicit dependency between e.g. virtio_net and virtio_pci. If we didn't
have the abstraction, virtio_net would be calling directly into
virtio_pci and we'd have an explicit dep. So, I was just trying to
artificially mimic that.
Another example of a lack of an explicit dependency causing problems is
Fedora's mkinitrd having this hack:
    if echo $PWD | grep -q /virtio-pci/ ; then
        findmodule virtio_pci
    fi
which basically says "if this is a virtio device, don't forget to
include virtio_pci in the initrd too!". Now, mkinitrd is full of hacks,
but this is a particularly unusual one.
Í'm thinking that maybe we should default to having virtio_pci built-in
if e.g. CONFIG_KVM_GUEST is set.

Nah, removing a module for device should actually work fine.
Anyway, with the root cause of Michael's traceback fixed, rmmod-ing
virtio_pci and re-loading it works just fine, so ...
Cheers,
Mark.
