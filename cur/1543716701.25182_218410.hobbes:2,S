Well, it seems to work better.  The computer has been up for more than
twelve hours now, and has supported the usual network traffic (a
handful of spa^Wemail, nntp, apt-get dist-upgrade and some web
browsing).  Let's hope it's not a fluke, and it'll stay up :-)

  It's GPL, although it includes a GPL-but-binary firmware (used to be
sent by hotplug, but it's now in the module itself, for some reason).
I'll recommend to its authors that they come show their work to these
lists, indeed.
  Thanks,
Roland.
