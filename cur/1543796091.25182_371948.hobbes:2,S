My take was to simply hold a u64 in the fs-private inode structure and
use ULONG_MAX for inode->i_blocks in case of an overflow.  Also has
the nice advantage of working with fs-sized blocks, not 512-byte ones:
	inode->i_blocks = ULONG_MAX;
	if (li->li_blocks<<3 < ULONG_MAX)
		inode->i_blocks = li->li_blocks<<3;
That said, your solution appears to be much better, as long as it
doesnt subtly break binary compatibility.
