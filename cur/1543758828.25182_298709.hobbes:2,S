I understand the desire and benifit to do this sort of fixing, but I 
really don't like extending the odd/even thing to other parts of the 
kernel version numbers
with 2.6.8 a different path was attempted with 2.6.8.1 couldn't we just 
use that numbering scheme (avoiding adding to the numbering confusion 
further) and plan on releasing a 2.6.11.1 next tuesday (or so) with the 
various paper-bag fixes?
If I understand bitkeeper properly Linus wouldn't even need to duplicate 
the patches, he should be able to fork his tree to do the paper-bag fixes 
in one fork while continueing development in the other one and then 
recombining them when either generates a release.
