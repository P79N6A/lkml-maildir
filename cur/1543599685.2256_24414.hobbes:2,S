Hi Herbert,
I also noticed this dupe a couple days ago and pointed it out to
the lkml and net code maintainers. Alexey Kuznetsov has
agreed, saying:
"Apparently, this is right. This happened ages ago when eliminating
second argument dev_queue_xmit()."
I assume a fix will be in the next major release.
Regards,
Bryan
