It's not a design issue - it's a legal issue at this point, and one that 
I'm not qualified to come up with a good answer for.  The biggest 
technical issue I think for open sourcing the VMI, is that it is not 
part of the kernel, but stand alone firmware with a rather bizarre build 
environment, so the code alone is not sufficient to allow it to be open 
sourced, but this is not a hard problem to solve.
