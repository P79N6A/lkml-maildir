As a practical matter, sync-on-file-close should solve most 
of the practical problem of data corruption if the device is 
yanked before being onmounted.  However, when I read 
'man 2 open' there is no O_SYNC_ON_CLOSE.  
Similarly 'man 8 mount' doesn't list any option -o synconclose
It sure would be nice to be able to set up a sync-on-file-close
in the hotplug equiv of /etc/fstab for USB devices ... 
(When I think of sync-on-file-close, I don't mean 'global sync 
when the file is closed', I mean 'sync only that file's data and 
metadata only when the file is closed'.  That way, you don't slow 
down systems doing a lot of i/o on other, unrelated files)
