Oh dear me. Wrong again. Microdrives require proper polite wakeups. But you
see camera vendors buy in IDE code from people who can read and follow 
standards documents.

You now have an absolute vote of *NO CONFIDENCE* on my part. I'm simply
not going to consider running your code. "It probably wont eat your disk"
and handwaving is not how you write a block layer.
How is anyone supposed to debug file system code in 2.5 when its known
that it will trash data on some disks anyway ? I'd like to see you cite
a paragraph where the IDE device is required to flush the data back
promptly, or on power off. I'd like to see what you plan to do about all
the IBM disks you plan to mistreat and give bad blocks that require a 
reformat ?
