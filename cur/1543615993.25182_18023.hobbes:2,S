It's very closely related; kinda like kissing cousins.
/sbin/hotplug is called from the kernel only, right?
I see no reason to change that at all for notification of devices that are
plugged in/removed by suprise.
I was thinking, though, more along the lines of triggering the probe for
devices that the kernel has a tough time finding on its own. E.g. peer
Host/PCI bridges, batteries, etc.
