    Judging on a FREQ value (about 125) from the boot logs, the BIOS had set 
up PLL to 50 MHz (125/192 ~ 32/50) which should have "spoilt" the value in the 
f_CNT register. Hence, we may guess that the BIOS had saved the f_CNT value 
beforehand. If not, there's not much we can do except to guess at the DPLL 
frequence that BIOS might have set.
MBR, Sergei
