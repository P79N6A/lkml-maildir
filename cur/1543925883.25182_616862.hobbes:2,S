There are already. IMO the problem is the development model.
There are tons new features in each new kernel release and 'tons new bugs'
which are not fixed during the release cycle nor in the .XX stable kernels.
Maybe after XX kernel releases there should be one just with bug-fixes _without_ any
new features , eg: cleaning bugs from bugzilla , know regressions , cleaning up code , 
removing broken drivers and the like.
