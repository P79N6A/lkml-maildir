   running X does not prevent you from compiling kernel (I did it with a 
lot lower spec'd machines before). It's true that on low end machine the 
kernel compile prevents you from doing much else but that's true 
regardless of X. Some X apps eat quite a lot of memory and if you run 
openoffice and mozilla (and gnome or kde or enlightement) you end up not 
being able to do anything else. But that's not problem of X, it's a 
problem of specific applications. I have been using X (under linux) 
since times of 486 & 128MB RAM and it's been quite OK (=responsive), 
given that appropriate apps are chosen.
