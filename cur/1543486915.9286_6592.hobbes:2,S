I was just playing around sending different sized pings over my network
at home and I noticed something weird when sending packets with sizes of
65465-8.  65469 gives an error of "packet size too large."  This is the
ouput from ping -c1 -s 65465 192.168.1.1:
PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 65465 data bytes
65473 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=140.0 ms           
wrong data byte #65464 should be 0xb9 but was 0xb8
It then prints out about 65k of hex digits.  The local kernel is 2.2.0
and the remote is 2.0.35.  I didn't notice any adverse effects from
these commands and I'm assuming it's actually a ping bug and not a
kernel bug.  I just thought I'd point it out incase it is a symptom of
something serious.
