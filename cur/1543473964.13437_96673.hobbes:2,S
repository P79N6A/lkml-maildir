Subject: ext2 cdrom; 2.20-pre2 : mount -o loop /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom

WEll I finally found a way to make my ext2 cdroms mount under the development
kernels.
noname-root:~#mount -t ext2 /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0,
       or too many mounted file systems
noname-root:~#mount -o loop /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom
noname-root:~#mount
/dev/sda2 on / type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /mnt/hda1 type ext2 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
/dev/sr0 on /mnt/cdrom type ext2 (ro,loop=/dev/loop0)
noname-root:~#df
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/sda2             707556  621650    49359     93%   /
/dev/hda1            2028098  714591  1208685     37%   /mnt/hda1
/dev/sr0              529445  529347       98    100%   /mnt/cdrom
This is very strange and I don't understand it.
An strace of mount -t ext2 /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom shows:
mount("/dev/cdrom", "/mnt/cdrom", "ext2", MS_RDONLY|0xc0ed0000, 0x8051fb0) = -1
EINVAL (Invalid argument)
Why should I have to use the loopback device ?
WWWWEEEEIIIRRRRDDDD !
Please cc replies to pjordan@blackwire.com.
Now If I could only figure out why "ls ~/Maildir/linux-kernel/new/"
takes over 4 miutes of cpu time and kicks the load average over 1
using 91% of the CPU before I impatiently kill it, yet
"echo *" in the same dir starts to puke stuff immediately I would
then go on to figuring out a way to read this maildir as if it were
a newsgroup.
