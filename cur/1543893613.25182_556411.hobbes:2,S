We need to find out why you see [-127, 127] range, because if joydev
would see [0, 4096] range it would perform automatic correction and
map values like this:
c0: 2048, c1: 2048, c2: 262144, c3: 262144
0 -> -32768
204 -> -29504
408 -> -26240
612 -> -22976
816 -> -19712
1020 -> -16448
1224 -> -13184
1428 -> -9920
1632 -> -6656
1836 -> -3392
2040 -> -128
2244 -> 3136
2448 -> 6400
2652 -> 9664
2856 -> 12928
3060 -> 16192
3264 -> 19456
3468 -> 22720
3672 -> 25984
3876 -> 29248
4080 -> 32512
Which is fine as far as I can see. What utility did you use that
reported [-127; 127] range?
