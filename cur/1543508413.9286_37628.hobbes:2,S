I forgot to mention that the file used for the pipe aieee
is on an ext2 fs.  Copying the file to a vfat floppy
and trying from there cause the same trouble.
A file on a joliet cdrom aieees too, when run through
the gunzip|less pipe.  
isofs have extra errors:
_isofs_bmap: block >= EOF (6, 8320)
_isofs_bmap: block >= EOF (7, 8320)
iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/3090, count=2
Looks like this is fs-independent.
