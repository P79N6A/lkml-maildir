I think you are missing the point.  printk can be called even before
kmalloc is usable and you cannot tell if kmalloc can be called yet.
Yes, it is unlikely but crashing during debugging just complicates
things.  Far better to just count and report dropped messages and never
call any other kernel functions from printk.  It also keeps a critical
kernel function nice and simple.
