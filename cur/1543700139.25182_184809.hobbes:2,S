Hello,
Release 0.4.0 for libsysfs is now available at:
	
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net
 
A number of changes have been made in this release which will 
require a few modifications to applications already using 
the library. (udev-009 already has a bulk of these changes).
Here are the important additions/changes:
	* Postponed reading directories and attributes until 
		absolutely necessary. 
	* Structure elements that are lists or references to 
		structures are not populated by default. APIs 
		have now been provided to populate them.
	* All "open" functions that take absolute path as argument
		now have a "_path" suffix.
	* Provided attribute "refresh" functions to read in updated
		attribute values.
	* Changes for klibc compatibility.
	* Provided APIs to retrieve device/class_device "parent".
	* Added manpages for lsbus and systool (Thanks to Martin Pitt).
Please visit

 for 
more information.
Comments, suggestions welcome! 
Thanks,
Ananth
