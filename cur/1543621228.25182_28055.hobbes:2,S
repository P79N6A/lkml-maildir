Please explain, in detail, why /proc/ide/hdX/settings:file_readhead
no longer controls the readhead for that device.  If this is
the case in thr current 2.4 kernel, or if it will become the
case if/when the IDE patches are merged then that needs fixing.
Look, I agree that the current readhead controls are junk, and
do not belong in the driver layer at all.   All I'm saying is
that we need per-device controls, for whatever scheme we end
up using for readhead in 2.5.   We really don't want to have
the same sized readhead for CDROMs, floppies and super-duper
RAID arrays.
