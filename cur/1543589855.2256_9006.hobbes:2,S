Are the dependencies for each disjoint union kept hierarchically?  Such
as:
setting C = 'y' requires B = 'y'
setting B = 'y' requires A = 'y' 
etc.
If so, given the above ruleset involving symbols A, B and C, and given
that such a ruleset is violated for some reason (you don't even care
why), use the following approach:
set C to 'n' -> are we ok?
set B to 'n' -> are we ok?
set A to 'n' -> are we ok?
Inform the user of each change.  In a massively broken configuration you
could end up with a lot of stuff set to 'n' ultimately, but I think that
this generally would just end up shutting off troublesome configuration
settings, and requiring that the user then reset them manually.
In my example above I've idealized your idealized world of tristates
into a world of bistates.  How do you like that :-)
Instead of trying all possible combinations, instead for 2000 symbols
you only need (worst case) to check 2000 - each iteration you will have
changed one setting from y to n, so the most you can do is 2000 checks.
