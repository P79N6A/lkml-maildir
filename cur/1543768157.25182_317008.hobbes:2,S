Subject: [patch 1/6] uml: remove elf.h [ compile-fix, for 2.6.12 ]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/9/173

Actually remove elf.h in the tree. The previous patch, due to a quilt
bug/misuse, left it in the tree as a 0-length file, preventing the build to
see it as missing and to generate a symlink in its place.
