Ted, this is simply false. I first suggested a solution to this
problem on 3-APR-1999, and I've referred to it since then. It looks to
me that you are the one who has not followed the discussion. I wrote:

Whether or not you think this is an ugly solution, it clearly shows
that the problem you raised is easily solved. And it will work
securely over NFS unlike the sticky bit. Whatever you may think, using
NFS for privileged files has valid uses. My scheme gives the sysadmin
the choice, at least. You would remove that choice.

Obviously not Q.E.D.
