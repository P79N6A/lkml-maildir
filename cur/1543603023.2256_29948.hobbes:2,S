The error :
Curious - OSB4 thinks the DMA is still running.
OSB4 wait exit
appears to occur during the "rewrite" phase of Bonnie++ every time we run it.
The setup is a Tyan 2515 with a Seagate ST310211A drive. Bonnie ran for ~48 
hours on 2.4.10 without slowdown (I assume this is because the extra check in 
-ac isn't present) but there was some file system corruption after the 1st 24 
hours:
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,6)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in 
datazone - block = 2138996092, count = 1
