As you say it should be gated by lru_lock and we should not expect to
see pages with the wrong type on the list.  I would swear that I was
seeing pages on the wrong list there for a bit in testing and mistakenly
thought they were in transition.  A quick review at least says thats
false.  So I'll reinstate the BUG() and retest to see if I am smoking
crack or there is a bigger bug out there.
