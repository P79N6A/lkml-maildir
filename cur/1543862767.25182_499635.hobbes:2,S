What would this mean?
Lets say we have a simple machine with 4 nodes, cpusets disabled.
Lets say all tasks are allowed to use all nodes, no set_mempolicy
either.
If a task happens to fill up 80% of one node with dirty pages, but
we have no dirty pages yet on other nodes, and we have a dirty ratio
of 40%, then do we throttle that task's writes?
I am surprised you are asking for this, Andi.  I would have thought
that on no-cpuset systems, the system wide throttling served your
needs fine.  If not, then I can only guess that is because NUMA
mempolicy constraints on allowed nodes are causing the same dirty page
problems as cpuset constrained systems -- is that your concern?
