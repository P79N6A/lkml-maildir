Hi, There,
    I am a newer of this list. Happy new year!
    Yesterday I upgraded the kernel 2.0.34-0.6 to a new 2.1.13.
    I did all exactly as the guidance of the README. It seemed that
all had passed the configuration, compilation and the installation.
However, when I restart my computer (Pentium II-300, Memory=256M),
I found that there are two problems remained as follows:
   (1) The usable maxmum Memory is not 256M, but 64M.
   (2) X-window could not be used anymore.
   Waiting for your kind reply and thanks in advance.
