the above change is unnecessary: there is absolutely no harm from a 
migrated watchdog thread touching another CPU's timestamp for a short 
amount of time. [Furtermore, why doesnt the hotplug CPU code use the 
kthread_should_stop() mechanism to gracefully stop per-CPU threads, 
instead of migrating unsuspecting threads and putting ugly hooks into 
every such thread?]
the other fix (to touch before bringing the CPU up) looks OK, but it's 
simpler to initialize it via the oneliner below. Andrew, this is what 
i'd suggest to do for v2.6.16. [i'll send an updated softirq-rework 
patch in the next mail.]

------
fix from Nathan Lynch: initialize the softlockup timestamp of freshly 
brought up CPUs with jiffies.
