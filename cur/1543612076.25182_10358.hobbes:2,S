Subject: Re: Compilation error with Kernels 2.4.16 && 2.5.X
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Upon further investigation this is related to the specific version of
binutils used in linking the kernel after compilation. Please see
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=122179&repeatmerged=yes
for more details. Additionally, not all kernel .configs will trigger
it. The USB segment is definitely in a common point, though. 2.2 kernels
don't seem to exhibit it; but any 2.4 with certain .configs will.
