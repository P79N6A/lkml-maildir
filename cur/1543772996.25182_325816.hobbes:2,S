Please take this discussion to the networking development list,
netdev@vger.kernel.org.  It is an interesting issue, but let's discuss
it in the right place. :-)
Prequeue has many advantages, in that processes are properly charged
for TCP processing overhead, and copying to userspace happens directly
in the TCP input path.
This paces TCP senders, in that ACKs do not come back faster than the
kernel can get the process on the cpu to drain the recvmsg() queue.
ACKs sent immediately (without prequeue) give the sender the illusion
that the system can handle a higher data rate than is actually
feasible.
Unfortunately, if there are bugs or bad heuristics in the process
scheduler, this can impact TCP performance quite a bit.
Also, applications using small messages and which are sensitive to
latency can also be harmed by prequeue, that's why we have the
"tcp_low_latency" sysctl.  It actually has a slight bug, in that one
of the checks (where you placed the "if (0") was missing, which is
fixed by the patch below:
[TCP]: Fix sysctl_tcp_low_latency
When enabled, this should disable UCOPY prequeue'ing altogether,
but it does not due to a missing test.
