The hotplug event of interest is the insertion of the snd_intel8x0
chip, not the insertion of the LPC bridge. It's hooking to both
events, it only needs to hook to the snd_intel8x0 event and then
search for a bridge if there is one.
Takashi says the code is already gone in the alsa tree so we don't
know how they fixed it.
