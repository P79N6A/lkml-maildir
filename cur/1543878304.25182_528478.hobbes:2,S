Yes.  There are theoretical corner cases in which it may be less efficient
than the current approach, but in the usual situation it is _much_ better.

Actually, I don't agree with that.  In the normal situation (ie. one extent is
needed) there is no difference as far as the memory usage or performance
are concerned, but if there are more extents, the rbtree should be more
efficient.

Exactly.
