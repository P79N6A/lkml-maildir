Hi Tapio,
You are the author of these files. Are you still maintaining them?
If not, do you know who is the current maintainer?
These two object files hold the biggest data objects in the whole Linux kernel
after lockdep:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   1258  160516       0  161774   277ee ./drivers/usb/misc/emi26.o
   1504  209296       0  210800   33770 ./drivers/usb/misc/emi62.o
Basically, these are big arrays of the following structures:
typedef struct _INTEL_HEX_RECORD
{
        __u32   length;
        __u32   address;
        __u32   type;
        __u8    data[MAX_INTEL_HEX_RECORD_LENGTH];
} INTEL_HEX_RECORD;
I suggest the following optimizations:
Change structure to
typedef struct _INTEL_HEX_RECORD
{
        __u8   type;
        __u8   length;
        __u16   address;
        __u8    data[MAX_INTEL_HEX_RECORD_LENGTH];
} INTEL_HEX_RECORD __attribute__((__packed__));
Store gzip compressed tables and unpack them at load time.
Declare them const and __initdata.
I can do it if there is no active maintainer.
