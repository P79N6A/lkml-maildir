When I worked for what was then called Mercury Communications, there
was a long-standing rule that we had to document in detail cases we
came across of customers using non-approved equipment. As far as POTS
equipment was concerned, it was almost routine, but when it came to
ISDN equipment, the general attitude was "Why bother, we can't do
anything about it anyway" since no matter how well we checked the
documentation, OfTel refused to clear them for further action, and we
were shackled as a result...

That I can understand.
Best wishes from Riley.
