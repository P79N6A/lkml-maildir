Ah, yes, four-point module interface: init, start, stop, destroy.
Then you can call stop, realize the module is not at zero refcnt (you
lost a race), then call start again.  Similar thing if someone
requests a stopped module.
Now you're going to have to change request_module() so the kernel can
realize that you're requesting a module which already exists
(request_module()'s effect currently depends on /etc/modules.conf of
course).
Now, of course, your module interface is starting to look really
complex, too.  Because you want to solve the "half-loaded" problem, so
you really want "init" to reserve resources, and "start" to register
them (ie. start can't fail).  So every register_xxx interface needs to
be split into reserve_xxx and use_xxx.
We can do all this, of course.  I have an awful lot of patches.  But
I'm not really happy with any of them.
Rusty.
