Hi,
     I guess when it comes down to it I don't see how this solves the 
problem. Even with a maximum permissable latency we're certain to get 
into a pathological case eventually where requests are being 
generated faster than they can be processed. As long as that state 
remains (i.e. generating them too fast) then we're guaranteed to 
start starving some requests. It cannot be helped. Sorry to 
reiterate, but I really want to be clear here. If requests are being 
generated at a sustained rate faster than they can be processed then 
eventually something has to give and that something is likely to be 
the latency and something is gonna starve.
     Please keep in mind that I have no idea if my idea is feasible or 
even possible. It's the germ of an idea and perhaps it's time for me 
to get off my duff and actually attempt to implement something. If 
there is some way for the driver to say "I'm too busy right now, you 
may not submit your request now" via a high and low watermark on the 
request queue length then the starvation issue simply cannot occur. 
We can then handle short bursts of requests being generated faster 
than they can be processed, but we've got a defined threshold when we 
stop accepting new requests before handling the backlog. _That's_ 
what appears to be missing now, that guaranteed threshold where we 
say "Enough!" and handle what's on our plate before accepting any 
more.
     I really hope I'm not missing something obvious here...
	Cheers,
	Bruce.
