True. Minor correction:
-               b2 = (~b0 == 0 ? b0 : b1);
-               ofs = (~b0 == 0 ? 0 : 64);
+		b2 = (~b0 ? b0 : b1);
+		ofs = (~b0 ? 0 : 64);
Note that comment for this function is a bit confusing:
 * ... It's the fastest
 * way of searching a 168-bit bitmap where the first 128 bits are
 * unlikely to be set.

Agreed. Apparently asm/bitops.h?
