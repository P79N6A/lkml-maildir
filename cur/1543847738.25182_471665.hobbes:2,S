A valid criticism.  There was definitely a push to just get it
functional, so I can now see how the complexity crept into the
implementation.  The primary cause was the choice to explicitly handle
channel switching in raid5-dma.  However, relieving "client" code from
this responsibility is something I am taking care of in the async api
changes.

Definitely.

No, nothing important jumps out.  Just a follow up question/note about
the details.
You imply that the async path and the sync path are unified in this
implementation.  I think it is doable but it will add some complexity
since the sync case is not a distinct subset of the async case.  For
example "Clear a target cache block" is required for the sync case,
but it can go away when using hardware engines.  Engines typically
have their own accumulator buffer to store the temporary result,
whereas software only operates on memory.
What do you think of adding async tests for these situations?
test_bit(XOR, &conf->async)
Where a flag is set if calls to async_<operation> may be routed to
hardware engine?  Otherwise skip any async specific details.
