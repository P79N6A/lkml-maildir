Hi,
 just something positive for the weekend. With 2.4.5-ac21, the behaviour
on my laptop (128MB plus twice the sapw) seems a bit more sane. When I
start new large applications now, the "used" portion of VM actually
pushes against the cache instead of forcing stuff into swap. It is still
using swap, but the effects on interactivity are much lighter.
 So, if this is a preview of 2.4.6 bahaviour, there may be a light at
the end of the tunnel.
Have a good weekend
Martin
