CPU Hotplug 2.5.61
changes from current cpu hotplug tree:
- fixed build for UP w/ CONFIG_HOTPLUG - Stephen Hemminger
kernel/rcupdate.c
- added RCU CPU_OFFLINE handling which moves all current and pending callbacks from the dying
  cpu to a global queue, which is cleared a callback at a time in the rcu_softirq path.
	function(s) added:
		rcu_move_batch
 
kernel/timer.c
- We now migrate timers from the dying cpu to the current one.
	function(s) added:
		migrate_timers_from
mm/slab.c
- Made timer deletion happen on the OFFLINE path and be carried out by the owning cpu
arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c
- Removed dying cpu from irq_affinity masks in __cpu_die
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c
- Added helper to remove dying cpu from irq affinity masks, this is really a generic function
  and could be placed elsewhere given when we get a generic irq layer.
	function(s) added:
		migrate_irqs_from
All changes have been tested on 4 and 8way i386 (Courtesy of OSDL), although i'm not 
claiming stability at this stage (this is a review patch) we have managed 
to offline/online whilst doing a kernel compile (make -j8), however there 
are problems with the networking offline code which trigger when  
offlining cpus under load.
Problematic config options:
CONFIG_PREEMPT - causes premature scheduling
