If I could get the __raw_* versions for every arch, and there
wouldn't be any endianness troubles, it'd do.
I think a single or double "_" is enough warning to enable
full foot-shooting ability though.

The driver code is not very self-documenting this way.
If I see an io_to_io_barrier(), how am I to tell if it is
read to read, write to write, read to write, write to read,
read/write to read, read/write to write, read to read/write,
write to read/write, or read/write to read/write?
Considering just reads and writes to MMIO, there are
9 possible types of fence. SPARC seems to cover a
decent number of these distinctly; the instruction takes
an immediate value as flags.

I suppose the "sparse" tool could match up mapping type
with accessor type. That'd let you rely on the accessor to
be doing what you expect when you read the code.
Loose mappings are only arch-specific in implementation.
Generic non-arch driver code ought to be able to take
advantage of the performance benefits of loose mappings.
(that is: full any-any reordering)
