I'd like to second the query.  It's additional work I'd rather avoid to
have to track two versions.

Patches don't work with 2.4.9-ac series kernels.
I've put an updated version against 2.4.9-ac10 in
http://www.xyzzy.org.uk/farsync/hdlc-2.4.9-ac10.patch.gz
if you'd like to grab that.
I notice you include patches for existing kernel drivers and since the
farsync driver is now in the 2.4.9 kernel would you like me to supply
you with patches for that ?
