Not speaking directly for David, but I believe the reason is for  
background kernel code which needs to do filesystem access during a  
thread's execution with *completely* different security context from  
that of the thread.  Examples should be reasonably obvious; kNFSd is  
one, but it also includes anything where the kernel would poke  
directly into the filesystem, such as network filesystem cachefiles.

I would offer the suggestion of using the described "struct security"  
in-place in the task struct, in place of using all those fields  
individually.  That would be, in effect the "default" security  
context for any given task, if "NULL" is passed to the appropriate  
vfs function.  For CacheFiles and kNFSd, they could each allocate  
their own during initialization or new-connection and pass that to  
any "mkdir()", etc that they do on behalf of a given client.

I think mkdir() was just an example he was using, probably because it  
was the first VFS call he needed to set a security context on.   Next  
would come anything which CacheFiles or NFSd call on the underlying  
filesystem.
