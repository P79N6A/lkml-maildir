Thanks Charles.  However your algorithm does at least one very expensive
division (or two, depending on the relationship of modulus and divide on the
architecture you're running on) and two multiplies.  Everything in the code
I pointed to was simple addition and subtraction with a single modulus
operation.  I claim the running time of your function is substantially longer
than the running time of the one at  
http://wannabe.guru.org/alg/node136.html
on most processors.
I have no basis to argue one way or the other about quality of randomness
comparisons of these algorithms.  Quite possibly better randomness is WORTH a
couple of extra divisions and multiplies per skiplist insertion, especially if
searches and deletions are much more common than insertions.
