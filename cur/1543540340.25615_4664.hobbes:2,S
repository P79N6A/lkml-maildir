If you don't like it, then don't let it happen :)  There are several utilities out there that prevent this (noflushd is one of them).  I wrote one too.  It just disables the flushing of dirty buffers.  When it notices that the disks are back up (something read or wrote to the disk) it'll flush the buffers.  If this does not happen in a specified time, it'll flush and so it will wake the disk (I use a timeout of 12 hours, so the maximum time my disk is spun down is 12 hours).
You can always get the source from me if you like ...
If using this utility, it's not necessairy to use the noatime or nodiratime option for mount ...

Indeed, disks don't like being spun up and down a lot...
