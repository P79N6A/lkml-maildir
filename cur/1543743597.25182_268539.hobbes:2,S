The main problem I guess is that driver model does not allow registering
or removal of child devices during driver->probe() on the same bus. So
every bus does it its own way. Plus most buses were around way before
driver model so their historical locking rules affect this as well.
Down the road, as the stuff gets cleaned we can have a shot of pulling
bus code into drivre core, but not yet I think.

Right now not all parent PCI devices have drivers. IIRC there were talks
about implementing generic bridge driver but then some bridges need special
handling and the concern was that generic driver would prevent binding of
a special driver.

The system needs to handle situation when you physically yanking part of a
device tree and get rid of all devices, like in cases when you pull an USB
cable connected to a HUB with a mouse and a scanner and a pinter and whatever
else out there. We need to get rid of all these devices and I am not sure
that offloading this task to userspace is good idea. Especially if removal
happens when the box is suspended and at wakeup we have completely different
set of devices...

I do not see why we shoudln't but first I need to persuade Greg to apply
my patches ;)
