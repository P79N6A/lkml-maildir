At least on x86-64 there is currently so much other timer related
development going on (per CPU TSC timers, no idle tick, 64bit HPET
etc.)  that I don't want any x86-64 bits of that merged for the next
time. The other stuff needs to settle first.
I haven't read the patchset in full detail, but from a quick look
it's also not obvious too me in which way it is easier and cleaner
than the old setup. While the old code was quirky in parts the
new one seems to fall more in the overmodularization/too many
indirect callbacks trap.
It is also totally unclear how it will interact with vsyscall.
