In regards to this "mostly short but sometimes long" question, 
for very large SMP systems, running with some profiling enabled, might
allow the system to adapt to varying workloads and therefore shifting
lock contention / hold-times. 
Overall utilization despite the overhead might be lower, but this is
tbd.
In high-contention, short-hold time situations, it may even make sense
to have multiple CPUs with multiple waiters spinning, depending on
hold-time vs. time to put a waiter to sleep and wake them up.
The wake-up side could also walk ahead on the queue, and bring up
spinners from sleeping, so that they are all ready to go when the lock
flips green for them.
But in more simple cases, there should be a simple, default timeout
governed by context switch overhead or as defined by a derived number of
cache misses, as you suggested.
