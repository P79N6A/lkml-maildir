You need cancel. If you scheduled an async syscall, and the "session" 
linked with that chain is going away, you better have that canceled before 
cleaning up buffers to where the chain is going to read/write.
If you keep and hash or a tree indexed by atom-ptr, than become a matter 
of a lookup and sending a signal.
