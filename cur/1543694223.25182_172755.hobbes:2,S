Well, just a for-instance... my application is for a data recovery
company.  We have 4 bulk servers with a total of around 2TB of storage,
so we're certainly availing ourselves of the low prices of IDE disks. 
Most of this stuff is just archival; we keep it around as long as
possible in case our customers discover a month later that they're
missing a file or two.  We could probably increase our capacity by a
factor of 5 by compressing these volumes, and the performance penalties
wouldn't hurt us.  Honestly, if this is not a supportable thing, we will
probably just elect to incur the overhead of tar -j'ing things after the
customer signs off on the job.
I'm leaning on The Management to find and pay someone to support this in
ext3, but I don't think that's in the near future, unfortunately.
