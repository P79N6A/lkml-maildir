Hi,
by accident I discovered a fix for auto-negotiation on the sis-900.
in sis900_open(), sis900_check_mode() looks redundant, and when removing it
auto-negotiation works for sis900 and Crossfire 8720 (perhaps others).
I have tested it, but I have no ideas if there is any side effects,
so please test this on non-Crossfire setups.
the patch is made against 2.5.60-bk2 but this code havent changed for a long
time.
for some reason this has no effect on kernel 2.4...
