One possibly interesting mouse issue in 2.6.12-rc[1..4] is that when 
using /dev/psaux, I have found that my mouse cursor under GPM seems to 
be triggered into un-hiding when I issue some random number of 
non-hiding key-down events.  That is, press and release the keyboard 
shift key say 3 or 5 or 10 times, and the console mouse cursor will 
appear, just as if the mouse had been moved.  This bug is not in 2.6.11 
(nor Alan's 2.6.11-ac7, fwiw).
