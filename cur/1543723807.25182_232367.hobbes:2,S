Ok first take benchmarks ( use wget ), and secondly results from the internet 
vary day by day , hour to hour , minute by minute. Don't expect all sites on 
the internet to be the same speed, or even stay the same speed for that 
matter. For more accurate benchmark results setup a personal server on your 
own private network and benchmark http trasnfers using different kernels.
