Hi,
	Someone could explain why we have following code in kernel ?
spinlock (x)
atomic_inc (x->y)
spinunlock(x)
	I mean y being part of x should be atomically modified with a "normal"
operation ? What am I missing ? Does it mean we defined y atomic_t in
order to have atomic operations elsewhere without the lock held ? Simply
?
Regards,
FabF
