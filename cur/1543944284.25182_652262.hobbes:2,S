I used to be in this camp too: seeing rebasing as the ultimate evil.
However, what I found was that as I tried to preserve my merge tree's
history, I was picking up merge points with non trivial fixups.  You can
argue that this is how git is supposed to operate, but the problem is
that these merge points become immovable objects in the tree history ...
I can't rebase the tree at all any more and I can't simply remove a
commit (which gets messy for commits duplicated by other trees)  They
also effectively separate the fix up from the patch causing it.   Plus,
it became difficult for people to go to gitweb to see the tree history,
because everything before the merge point got buried.
I finally concluded that I needed to rebase my trees to resolve
conflicts rather than merging them.  The advantages are I know the exact
patch with the problem and I can keep the history annotated with what
had to be done to get it to apply.  Plus with git (and this is a huge
advantage over quilt) knowing the base of the patch, I can still use the
merge algorithms to help me do the fixup.
I'm not saying rebase constantly ... I'm still mindful of the disruption
it causes, so I only do it if I pick up an actual conflict.  However, I
do think it does becomes necessary at times.
The problem rebasing causes is that git is pretty horrible at rebasing a
tree which is based on your now rebased tree (try saying that after a
few martinis).  Git really needs to acquire better rebasing tools for
this one case, but if that were solved, I think a lot of the objections
to rebasing could be answered.
