Good day, Chuck and Niels,
From: Niels Kristian Bech Jensen <nkbj@image.dk>
I didn't see this error. Are you sure pre-patch-2.3.15-3 was applied
correctly?

	Always possible.  Here's take 2:
[root@sparrow src]# pwd
/usr/src
[root@sparrow src]# mkdir linux-2.3.15
[root@sparrow src]# rm -f linux
[root@sparrow src]# ln -sf linux-2.3.15 linux
[root@sparrow src]# cat /usr/src/source/kernel/linux-2.3.14.tar.bz2 |
bunzip2 - | tar -xf -
[root@sparrow src]# patch --ignore-whitespace --remove-empty-files -p0

	I hadn't noticed this before; I usually use patch -s (silent,
unless errors occur) in my kernel build script.  From the patch, it looks
like filemap.c.orig is created from scratch; perhaps it was left over in
Linus' tree when he did the diff.
	This is interesting; filemap.c.orig has an "int error" line that
is removed in filemap.c.  Could that be relevant?
	Cheers,
	- Bill
