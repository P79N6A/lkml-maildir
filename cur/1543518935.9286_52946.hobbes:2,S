You're probably right. Emprically it works well enough readonly in
2.3.21 (the kernel I have on my machine at work and I know that it's
survived a couple of "find"s over the whole of my NTFS partition in
the last week) but I note the write code (which is horribly broken
anyway) still uses update_vm_cache. My home machine _had_ got 2.3.26
on it but, thinking about it, I doubt that I've done any more than
mount the filesystem - anyway it doesn't even mount in .31 (and it
leaves a corrupt entry in the super_blocks list which then hoses the
whole machine because sync fails).
It _has_ been fixed for the 64bit arithmetic problems so the corpse is
still twitching a bit if nothing else.
