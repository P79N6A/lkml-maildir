Hi All,
I have written a SPI protocol driver to connect a data acquisition chip 
to a character based interface to read and write the device.  It works 
well in PIO mode and I am trying to get it to work with DMA.
To enable the DMA I am setting enable_dma in the pxa2xx_psi_chip struct 
and dma_burst_size to 16 in the pxa2xx_spi_chip structure under the 
board master file arch/arm/mach-pxa/xxxx.c.
Other than that I have not really changed anything.  I had assumed since 
DMA code has been in the driver a while that DMA would just work.  I 
must be missing some setup data I need.
Any help would be appreciated,
Johnnie
