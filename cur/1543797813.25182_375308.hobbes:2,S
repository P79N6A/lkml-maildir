When compiling for ia64, the following warning message is omitted:
*** Warning: "per_cpu____sn_nodepda" [arch/ia64/sn/kernel/xpc.ko] has
no CRC!
The definition for this is:
DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct nodepda_s *, __sn_nodepda);
EXPORT_PER_CPU_SYMBOL(__sn_nodepda);
I modified arch/ia64/defconfig to include:
CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN_XP=m
I was going to look into this unless someone already knows the correct
fix for the problem.
Thanks,
Robin Holt
