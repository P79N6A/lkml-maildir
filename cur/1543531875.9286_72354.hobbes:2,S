I get the exact same issue. When I benchmark my harddisk under linux, I get
~15MB/s under the Intel BX UDMA33 controller, and ~19MB/s under the HPT366
UDMA66 controller, tested with hdparm -t (hdparm -T gives me >128MB/s).
Now, under Windows 2000, I get 28.2MB/s. All measurements taken from the
outer recording zone.
Mark Hahn says this is hdparm being a not-so-good benchmark, however, it
seems it gets quite close to the disk, so it is a nice, pure test, and can
measure one very important metric. If it was the case that the hdparm was a
bad test, bottleneck and so on, then why the variation in performance
between the iBX and HPT366 controller? - certainly not the IDE bus bandwidth
(as shown by the consistent W2K results).
I'd love to be able to achieve platter speeds without the need for raw I/O
(well, rawer than what hdparm does, anyway).
Harald - what did you use to do your benchmarks?
