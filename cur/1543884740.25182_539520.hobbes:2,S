The reason is i do not wish to make changes to it, till i can fix it. It
is indeed hard to fix things that support a lot of devices, with
different issues. There are enough of issues in there.
You can look at all those frontend not found issues on the DVB ML.
The people who make all these noise, do nothing but just play politics.
Just do a search on the linux-dvb ML at gmane.org. You can easily find them.
