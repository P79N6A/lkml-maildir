Well I wasn't trying to make a point there so it isn't a big deal... but
he has known to say the 64-bit hash table is insane or broken. If he's
since recanted, I'd be interested to read the post :)

And that wasn't due to the 128 sg limit?
I guess 10% isn't a small amount. Though it would be nice to have
before/after numbers for Linux. And, like Andrew was saying, we could
just _attempt_ to put contiguous pages in pagecache rather than
_require_ it. Which is still robust under fragmentation, and benefits
everyone, not just files with a large pagecache size.
