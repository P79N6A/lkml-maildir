I had a DS10 here that had, what appeared to be, a bad crystal.  The clock
would start at about 1/2 to 3/4 the expected clock rate and over about 20
minutes would move towards what it should be at.  It appeared to overshoot
the right clock-rate and then below until the oscillations would dampen
down to the correct rate.
I was doing RTLinux work on it so a bad clock wasn't acceptable.  It lives
in the garage now since I had a another DS10 that worked right.  I never
found what was actually going wrong with it or found a fix.
I would argue, though, that the Alpha clock itself is a crazy thing and
shouldn't be expected to work right :)
