Just to summarize my discussion with Steve today, I put together a
machine with one of these boards (Tyan Tiger MPX S2466N-4M) with
2xMP1900+ processors and 4x512MB PC2100 registered ECC DIMMs (Corsair
CM73SD512R-2100).  The machine runs fine under concurrent big CPU and
IO loads.  I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this
board, although I do think these things run rather close to spec and
are sensitive to just about any oddity.
(I also have a bunch of the previous revision of Tyan MPX boards and
they're stable as well.  I never could get the early generation Tiger
MP boards to work at all.)
