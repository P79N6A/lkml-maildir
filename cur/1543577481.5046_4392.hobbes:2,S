The one in prerelease.

Well, got it working under 2.2.17. I suspect it is just a matter of the 
drivers in 2.4.x not accomodating desktop-based PCMCIA readers. In the 
latest PCMCIA Howto there is a subsection under 2.3 on such devices and 
workarounds needed to get them running - none of them are recognised by 
the i82365 driver in 2.4.0-prerelease.
I think I'll just stick to 2.2.x for the time being - if anyone fancy a 
go at it I'm more than willing to try out the code.
