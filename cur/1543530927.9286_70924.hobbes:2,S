If you mean "will we have to take this into account when building
modules", then yes, it does end up being something that modules will know
about. 
We could avoid that by not using these kinds of inline functions for
modules, but as I'm not a big believer in stable binary interfaces anyway
(binary modules are quite problematic as it is), I actually much prefer to
tell people that they have to recompile their modules if they change the
type of their kernel.
