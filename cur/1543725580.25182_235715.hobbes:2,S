Hi,
I'm surprised with a dumb problem at boot time. No answer anywhere on
google. At boot the kernel complains :
kernel : cannot find map.
This is supposed to mean : no System.map file where it should be.
But I swear it is :
lrwxr-xr-x    1 root     root           16 Jul 17 12:03 System.map ->
System.map-2.6.7
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         837K Jul 22 18:49 System.map-2.6.7
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            1 Nov  5  2003 boot -> .
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         1.0K Jul 22 19:20 grub
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         1.7M Jul 22 18:49 kernel-2.6.7
I tried to rebuild the kernel (in case I missed the file copy) : same
result.
Am I wrong somewhere ?
(I only did make bzImage and copied the kernel image and system.map
files in /boot, as usually)
thx !
bye
