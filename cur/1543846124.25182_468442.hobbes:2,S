Subject: [PATCH] - add PNP IDs for FPI based touchscreens
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/1/157

The Compaq TC1000 and Fujitsu Stylistic range of tablet machines use 
touchscreens from FPI. These are implemented as serial interfaces, 
generally exposed in the ACPIPNP information on the system. This patch 
adds them to the 8250_pnp driver tables, avoiding the need to mess 
around with setserial to set them up.
I haven't been able to confirm what FUJ02B5, FUJ02BA and FUJ02BB are. 
FUJ02B1 refers to the controller for the system hotkeys. FUJ02BC appears 
to be the last in the range - after this, they moved to Wacom-based 
systems.
