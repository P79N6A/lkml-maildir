I think adding a function like this is more simple way.
(call this istead of nr_free_pages().)
==
int nr_available_memory() 
{
	unsigned long sum = 0;
	for_each_zone(zone) {
		if (zone->free_pages > zone->pages_high)
			sum += zone->free_pages - zone->pages_high;
	}
	return sum;
}

BTW, vm_enough_memory() doesn't eat cpuset information ?
