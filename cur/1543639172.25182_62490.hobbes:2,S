 I'm sorry, but I don't have an NVidia card, and I definitely didn't
load and unload that module. It must be something else.
AFAIK, the only proprietary module that is loaded is the fa312,
which is a driver for my ethernet card,  which is still loaded
and has never caused any problems for the 1.5 years I've used it.
This problem is new with the 2.4.19 kernel.
