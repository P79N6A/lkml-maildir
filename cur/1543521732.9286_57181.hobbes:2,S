	What's the point of having it if you have NULL ->check_media_change()?
It's never called. Do you plan to implement ->check_media_change() (if it
makes sense at all, that is)? If you don't - well, frevalidate_logvol()
should be removed. Please, clarify the situation. Right now it's a dead
code - nothing ever calls it.
