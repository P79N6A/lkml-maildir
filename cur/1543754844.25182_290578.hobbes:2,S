yes for ioports. But I'm afraid I was too optimistic about eflags for
iopl, that's not in the per-task tss, it's only stored at the very top
of the kernel stack and inherit during fork/clone. So we probably need
to check esp0 and read the top of the stack to see if a task has eflags
set. esp0 is definitely stored in the thread struct when the task is
rescheduled, and it cannot change for each given task, so we can access
it even while the task is runnable and it shouldn't be corrupted by
iret. But the problem is sysenter is optimized not to save eflags on the
kernel stack, so the top of the stack - 12bytes would not contain eflags
if sysenter is in use.
So basically we'd need to change iopl to propagate the info to the task
struct synchronously somehow, because we can't read it reliably from the
kernel stack.
