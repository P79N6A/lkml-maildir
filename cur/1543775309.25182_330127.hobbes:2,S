I do ;) Esp in vendor out of tree crap. It's a good compile time
diagnostic so the junk code doesnt' hit mainline but gets fixed first.

but it can be fixed to not add that few kb while retaining the checking
value. All that needs is for it to be a define that calls the worker
function. Eg the check gets optimized out and all that remains is the
call to the worker function that does the actual delay.
