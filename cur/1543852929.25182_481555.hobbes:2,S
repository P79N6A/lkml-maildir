that's a calculated risk on their side (and they know that); they're
balancing not functioning on a set of machines off against needing more
kernels.

it won't be turned off on machines that support dual core processors
etc, since those DO get validated and designed for APIC use.. even if
you only stick a single core processor in. So yes you're right, that
nowadays is a pretty large group. But it's the safe group I guess:)
