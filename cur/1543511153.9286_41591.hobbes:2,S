This isn't possible on x86.  There are only six general registers to
pass parameters in (well, you could use %ebp, too, but %esp is certainly
out of question).  That's the reason why you can only use five arguments
plus the syscall number.
I'd suggest to pass a pointer to a struct in userspace instead.
