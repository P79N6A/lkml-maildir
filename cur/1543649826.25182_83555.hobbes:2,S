Most C compilers don't allow you to mix declarations and code.
This is allowed only in new C standards. But GCC 3 seems to cope,
so it's probably fine for new kernels.

I think #include fixes are best sent to Rusty Trivial Russell.
Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au> [5 feb 2002]

	Want me to add this to the trivial patch collection for tracking?
	If so just send (or cc:) it to trivial@rustcorp.com.au.
BTW, never misspell his name, he will be very upset.
He is *Russell*. Note which letters are doubled and which are not. ;)
