Hi!
   It is rather strange to 'bk pull 
http://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
' 
and to find in Makefile:
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 0
EXTRAVERSION =
   Or it is only me who finds this strange?
   When transition from 2.5 to 2.6 is planned?
   After all stable branch deserve to have NOT odd version number :)

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
