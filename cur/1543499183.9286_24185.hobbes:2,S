Plowing through the archive of the list, I found an entry by Alan Cox,
stating that he had a data sheet discribing how to set up the onboard
(Yamaha) soundcard of the SE440BX-2 to emulate a SB-Pro, but that the card
remained unsupported because that was about the only in it. My first
question is: is there any progress in developement of a driver?
My second question is: if there is not, how hard is it write a driver that
sets it up as an SB-Pro and then uses it as such?
If anyone has any pointers on how to go about such a project, I'm willing
to give it a try.
