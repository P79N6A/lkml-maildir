I am running the latest LinuxPPS patch from Rodolfo Giometti.

I don't have a dmesg for 2.6.18.1 on this machine (did not save it).
Will do when there is a next reboot of this VIA CL6000E board.
When the machine was idle offset and jitter would be in the 0.00X range.
Now it is more in the 0.XXX range or worse.
Performance for these figures has at least deteriorated a factor of
about 10.
The mrtg graphs are of no use since in the month graph the 'good' part
just moved off the screen and in the year graph the resolution is too
low. :-(
