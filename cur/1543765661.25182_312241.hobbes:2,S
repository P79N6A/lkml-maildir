One challenge that might make this issue a little tricky is that
you have to handle double-indirection, where the kernel copies in
a buffer that includes a pointer to some other buffer that you then
have to copy in.  I think this comes up in some of the ioctl() calls.
Because only the guts of the ioctl() implementation knows the format of
the data structure, only it knows what system_call_data_prep() calls
would be needed.  So, everywhere that currently does copy_from_user()
would have to do system_call_data_prep().  (It wouldn't be sufficient
to call system_call_data_prep() once in some standardized way at the
start of each system call, and leave it at that.)
