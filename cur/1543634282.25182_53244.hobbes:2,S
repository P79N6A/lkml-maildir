As I wrote to you offlist a week or two ago, I've tried tracking
this down, but found no real fix. I've a box here that doesn't
like preempt at all, but it's only my tree that the oops seems
to show up in. 
Robert Love and myself stared at the (minimal) backtrace that
it caused a week or two ago and got nowhere. The only solution
I found so far was to disable preempt on that box.
If you can rig this box up to a serial terminal and capture
the first oops and decode it, it'll be interesting to see if
we're hitting the same bug (Which I suspect we are, the symptoms
sound identical).
I'll investigate some more when I get time.
