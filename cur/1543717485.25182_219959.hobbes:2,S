When booting into 2.6.6 (compiled with gcc 3.4, could that be the
problem?), my USB mouse does not work any more.  Neither hot nor cold
plugging it works.  USB detects a low speed device and then hangs.
Now I am used to USB not working at all under Linux on my desktop with
VIA chipset, but now USB is also hosed for Intel chipsets?  Here is the
dmesg from 2.6.5, where my USB mouse still worked:
  drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered new driver usbfs

2.6.6 never reaches the "input: " line.  What gives?
