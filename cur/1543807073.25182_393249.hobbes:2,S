I did but the patch sat in Greg's and AKPM's trees for a while, so the
first release which contains the CFQ+ub fix is 2.6.16-rc2.
But in any case if no USB devices were connected, ub cannot be in
the picture. It's true even if they were connected and disconnected.
A queue has to be in use before this happens.
