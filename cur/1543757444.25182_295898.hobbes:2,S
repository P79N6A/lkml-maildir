Yes, I was thinking about this, too. An UPS is pretty much the same
thing to a desktop as a battery is to a notebook. And I also got to the
conclusion that this is a bad idea.
But now that you are talking about this, I think there is some merit to
that way.
UPSes are usually handled by userspace daemons, either through serial
ports or via USB over hiddev (which is another driver that should be
redone from scratch). 
So we may need a way to loop these events through the kernel to make
them available to the power event handling software. uinput would be a
rather straightforward solution here ...

ACPI is too platform specific. We really need some platform independent
way to be able to have a simple software solution.

Yes, it's a reasonable way. But the other way around (passing most power
related events through input) also is quite compelling.
