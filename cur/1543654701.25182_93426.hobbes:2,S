linux-net _might_ be more appropriate.

Just a few thoughts:
Have you tried connecting them directly via a crossover cable?
Are they definitely connected via a hub, and not a switch?
Maybe one of the cards is jabbering, causing a lot of packet loss,
which is only noticable when transfering between local machines?
What happens when both machines make an ftp connection to a host on
the internet?
John.
