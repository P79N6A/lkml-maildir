Yes, in the current implementation, Linux needs checksum offload. But there
is no reason, your driver can't compute the checksum in software.

Allocating large buffers is problematic on busy systems.
See lastest e1000 or sky2 that use frag_list.

Read the source. Setting up fragmented buffers has less helper
functions, but isn't that hard.
