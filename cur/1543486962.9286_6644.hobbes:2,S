Hi,
on special request from a few people and because the
linux-kernel traffic still is too high, I have set up
a new mailing list:
	linux-testers@nl.linux.org
The list is there to discuss and speed up the development
of new and exiting kernel features by bringing the testing
and evaluation of the patches out in the open. It is also
a nice way to find testers for your new kernel patch.
You can subscribe to the list by sending a message to:
	majordomo@nl.linux.org
with a body of:
	"subscribe linux-testers"
The mailing list archive is at:
	
http://mail.nl.linux.org/lists/linux-patches/
Linux kernel patches can be found at:
	
http://linux-patches.rock-projects.com/
Please move non-necessary stuff out of linux-kernel and
onto one of the more appropriate lists!
regards,
Rik -- If a Microsoft product fails, who do you sue?
