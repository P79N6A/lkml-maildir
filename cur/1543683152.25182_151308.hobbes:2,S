Who is "the list"?
As a long-time subscriber, I quite enjoyed reading Michael's thoughts.
If you want to say the discussion is off-topic, fine.  It is.  But
please do not ascribe views to some mythical majority of members, who
have not in fact expressed the view you would like them to.
We have quite enough problems with that sort of thing in the real world.
