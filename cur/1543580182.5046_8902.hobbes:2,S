  The following patch makes drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c wait with probing
  pdev->irq and pdev->resource[] until we call pci_enable_device. This
  is recommended due to hot-plug considerations (according to Jeff Garzik).
  It applies against ac12 and 241p11.
  Comments?
At a quick glance it looks reasonable to me.
