The .config is what we'd be needing.
Also please test a more recent kernel, such as
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test2/2.6.0-test2-mm4
or
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots
There have been init-section fixes and a big sound update since
test2.
