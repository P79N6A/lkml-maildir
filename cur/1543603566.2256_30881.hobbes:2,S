Yep. Vesafb started as a nice gimmick to show that it's possible, and turned
out to be a solution for yet another
we-don't-release-specs-to-OS/FS-people company.

Euh, most fbcon-* drivers already do this. Grep for fb_write in e.g.
drivers/video/fbcon-cfb8.c and count the byte accesses (=> 0).

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
