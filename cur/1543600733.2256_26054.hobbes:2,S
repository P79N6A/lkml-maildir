Hmm, good point:
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/sda6             841616    4508   837108      1%   /tmp
/dev/sda7             124407   63774    54209     54%   /var
/dev/sdb5             855138  677328   177810     79%   /home
/dev/sdc7            4191237 3946214   245023     94%   /usr
My thinking was that I've managed to run out of space on all of the
partitions in the past and had to prune a lot of stuff... so nearly all
the blocks should contain at least some "likely" data. Still, I guess I
need to verify that this isn't distorting the results. The program needs
to recurse over all files on the filesystem rather than all blocks on a
partition.
