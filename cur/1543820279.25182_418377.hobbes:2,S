I agree that it is a good idea to specify the characters to
reject, but I would like to use the function without having an
additional local pointer variable. In my opinion this
functionality is enough for most cases.
What about something like that:
/**
 * strrtrim - Remove trailing characters specified in @reject
 * @s: The string to be searched
 * @reject: The string of letters to avoid
 */
static inline void strrtrim(char *s, const char *reject)
{
      char *p;
      const char *r;
      for (p = s + strlen(s) - 1; s <= p; p--) {
            for (r = reject; (*r != '\0') && (*p != *r); r++)
                  /* nothing */;
            if (*r == '\0')
                  break;
      }
      *(p + 1) = '\0';
}
Regards
Michael
