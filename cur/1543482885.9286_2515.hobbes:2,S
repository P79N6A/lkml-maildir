The changes needed to support up to 2Gigs of RAM on Intel are listed in
linux/include/asm-i386/page.h.
They are a bit wrong (see below), but they are there.

Many people said that this patch would risk to break many drivers
and won't go in 2.2.x, at least for now.
Also, this patch is not *necessary* (even though it would be useful) to support
up to (almost) 2Gigs of RAM on Intel.

As Linus said just a few days ago, you can change PAGE_OFFSET
from 0xC0000000 to 0x80000000 in linux/include/asm-i386/page.h ,
also change 0xC0000000 -> 0x80000000 in linux/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds
and recompile (remember to recompile modules too)
The resulting kernel will support and use up to 1984MB:
not plain 2Gigs, but near.
Please notice that the note in linux/include/asm-i386/page.h which says to
change 0xC0000000 -> 0x70000000 is wrong as it would also require the patch
you quoted.
