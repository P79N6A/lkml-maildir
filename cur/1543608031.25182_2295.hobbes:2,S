Greetings,
I thought that I'd mention that on recent PPC kernels the ide modules 
won't load:
/lib/modules/2.4.14-pre3/kernel/drivers/ide/ide-mod.o: unresolved symbol 
ppc_generic_ide_fix_driveid
/lib/modules/2.4.14-pre3/kernel/drivers/ide/ide-mod.o: unresolved symbol 
ppc_generic_ide_fix_driveid
This has been happening for quite some time, since around 2.4.2 or so. 
 I'm using:
gcc version 2.95.3 19991030 (prerelease/franzo/20001125)
binutils 2.11.2
glibc-2.2.4
please cc me any replies as I don't subscribe to the list.
thanks,
Ethan Weinstein
