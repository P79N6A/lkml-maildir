IIRC ... the original suggestion that was made and partially
implemented a few years ago (code was disabled at runtime, not just
wrapped in an ifdef originally) was that cifs_demultiplex_thread would
take the incoming responses from the server for cifs multishot notify
smbs and queue them to a dnotify queue.   The cifs dnotify thread was
inteneded to -- only -- process the items in the dnotify queue, parse
the response to see which of the inline worker functions (in
include/linux/fsnotify.h e.g. fsnotify_create) ineeds to be called,
check if we have a dnotify or inotify for the corresponding inode and
call the generic hook (e.g. fsnotify_d_move or fsnotify_nameremove or
fsnotify_create etc.).   Adding something like that back in would be
easy enough and wrapping inside an ifdef ... but the people who
understand more about inotify presumably don't know about CIFS or SMB2
etc. so it is not likely to be implemented as one step ... but needs
to be staged in.
