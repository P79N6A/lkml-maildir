As we look into developing PCMCIA support in the
2.4/2.5 kernel trees, in addition to reading the
pcmcia-cs code to learn about problems with specific
devices that need to be handled, David Hinds also
a reference page that lists some a bunch of issues
that are in varying degrees of resolution:
	
http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/BUGS
This may be a useful resource.  I'll see whether
David has time to update this page with a bit more
detailed explanations of the problems.  Some of the
items are pretty vague.  For example,
	the Asix AX88190 chipset, which has
	several serious bugs and incompatibilities
	that render the regular pcnet_cs driver
	unusable
It would be nice to know exactly what those bugs
and incompatibilities are.  :-)
Anyhow, I hope this helps,
	Miles
