Definitely. Usually "it looks fishy" feeling should be trusted - if code
is non-obvious it's more likely to contain bugs.
How it was? "The goal is to write clear code, not clever code". And right
now dir.c in the patch is not clear enough - better than the corresponding
code in the tree (esp. in ext2_readdir()), but still needs cleaning up.
ObFsck: router in the $ORKPLACE apparently deciding that it's a good time
to shit itself and external SCSI on one of the home boxen joining the
fun. Sheesh...
