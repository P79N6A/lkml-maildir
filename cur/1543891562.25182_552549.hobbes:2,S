Patches are against 2.6.22-rc3-mm1
This series of patches enhances the feature set of EDAC, fixes some
bugs and
adds some new memory drivers.
The patches do the following:
1- Various cleanups
2- Altered the file 'edac_mc.c' to be for memory controller code only.
Moved the
module startup and exit code to edac_module.c
3- The 'core' of EDAC is now the 'edac_core.ko' module
4- Added the new 'edac_device' class of EDAC controller. With this new
class, non-memory ECC hardware detectors can be manged, such as
L1/L2 ECC detectors, DMA, Central switches, Fibric switches, etc.
File 'edac_device.c' handles this new class
5- Moved sysfs related operations into their respective files,
'edac_mc_sysfs.c'
for Memory devices and 'edac_device_sysfs.c' for edac_device devices.
6- changed operation from semaphore to mutex operation
7- Modified operaton of PCI polling to be it own class instead of
built-in into
the EDAC CORE
8- Modified the CORE to use work queues instead of a dedicated kthread
for polling
9-New memory controller drivers:  Intel 5000X, Intel 30X0
10- Added sysfs controlls ability to the top level of memory and
edac_device controllers.
Low level driver can now add their own specific attributes and
controllers. 
Useful for accessing error injection hardware registers.
11- Patches that perform some cleanup via the Lindent script for code
conformance.
12- A NMI hook mechanism to provide notification to the low level
driver
if a NMI event occurred during a poll operation, and thus re-poll the
device.
The features have come from their respective developers on MIPS, PPC,
x86, and 
others.
