	I think the problem is, a replacement/permanent fix to the way /dev
is done currently would be nice.  devfs is a step in the right direction,
but it needs to be something that can replace what is there otherwise it
isn't worth it to just add it on without fixing the real problem.  As such,
just saying "don't use it" isn't a good argument.
