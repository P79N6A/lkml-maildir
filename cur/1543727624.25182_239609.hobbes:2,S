It's fast. Lockless tasklist walking looks easy enough.
Find the process, grab the data, then find the process
again. If the process went away, discard the data.
I guess I'd like to have a /dev/ram-only device, for protection
against touching device memory (including AGP mem) by mistake.
It's odd that there doesn't seem to be such a device already.
Without this, I'd need to re-verify much more often.
Any problem I'm not seeing?
