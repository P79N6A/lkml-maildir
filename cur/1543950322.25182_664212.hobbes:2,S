No problem, will rebase.

Well, it is also trivial to implement gpiochip_reserve(start, end)
function that will mark reserved gpio->chip as ERR_PTR(-EACCESS),
and these ranges will be unavailable for the dynamic allocation.
Then, platforms could do gpiochip_reserve(0, GPIO_ARCH_END).
I think This is good solution from all and every POV, but this
needs a bit of platform code assistance.
What would you choice?

Will do.
