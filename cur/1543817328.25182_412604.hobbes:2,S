There is usually quite complex code involved although the code generated

Ok. We could change the MODE_ prefix but the problem with not passing this 
as a parameter that there are numerous functions derived from bit ops that 
are then also needed in lots of different flavors. Passing a parameter 
cuts down the number of variations dramatically.
