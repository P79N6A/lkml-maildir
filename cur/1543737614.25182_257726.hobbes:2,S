You mean cdda2wav? No I think it is a bleeding edge version since I run debian 
unstable:
Package: cdda2wav
Status: install ok installed
Priority: optional
Section: sound
Installed-Size: 324
Maintainer: Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org>
Architecture: i386
Source: cdrtools
Version: 4:2.0+a38-1
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.3.2.ds1-4)
Suggests: vorbis-tools, cdrtools-doc
Conflicts: xcdroast (<< 0.98+0alpha11)
Description: Creates WAV files from audio CDs
 cdda2wav lets you digitally copy audio tracks from a CD-ROM, avoiding
 the distortion that is introduced when recording via a sound card. Data
 can be dumped into raw (cdr), wav or sun format sound files. Options control
 the recording format (stereo/mono; 8/16 bits; sampling rate, etc).
 .
 Please install cdrtools-doc if you want most of the documentation and
 Readme-files.
It is one of the latest alpha versions according to the cdrtools website.
