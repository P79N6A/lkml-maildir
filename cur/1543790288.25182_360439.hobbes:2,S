Hi all,
I have problems to know whats is the current file descriptor. 
"task_struct" have a files_struct structure which contains all files for
a process in "fd". If I want to get the complete path for one of them,
How can I know what is the correct one in fd_array?
I suppose is something like:
path = d_path(task->files->fd[x]->f_dentry,
task->files->fd[x]->f_vfsmnt, buf, PAGE_SIZE);
But I don't know how to know this x for my correct file (for example the
last file I used).
Thanks in advance...
Cheers,
	Sergio
