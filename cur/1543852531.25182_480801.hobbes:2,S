Hi Balbir,
I did not know about arithmetic properties of the unsigned types, so
the misundertanding about jiffies calculation. It was my mistake.

It is ULONG_MAX. :)

Well, one of the behaviour we would like to check its the time that
the system remains idle. As the schedstat already provide the
sched_goidle (number of time the system gets idle), during the
measurements we would like to know also the time spent in the idle
state.
Checking the results, perhaps such new info is not necessary to be
included if we want the percentage of use in our measurements. For
instance if we want the cpu_load calculated as:
cpu_load = (cpu_time2 - cpu_time1)/sample_period
where "cpu_time" corresponds to the rq->rq_sched_info.cpu_time in the
kernel and "sample period" is the time spent running the use case.
So the "cpu_idle_load" can be calculated as (1-cpu_load).
If we include in the __sched_info_switch() (kernel) something like:
...
	if (prev != rq->idle)
		sched_info_depart(prev);
	else
		rq->rq_sched_info.idle_time +=
			jiffies - prev->sched_info.last_arrival;
	if (next != rq->idle)
		sched_info_arrive(next);
	else
		next->sched_info.last_arrival = jiffies;
...
We can calculated the cpu_idle_load at user space as:
cpu_idle_load = (cpu_idle_time2 - cpu_idle_time1)/sample_period
where cpu_idle_time corresponds to rq->rq_sched_info.idle_time
This info leads to the same result if we just base the calculation on
the (1-cpu_load) as mentioned previously.
BR,
Mauricio Lin.
