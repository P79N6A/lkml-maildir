Hrm... I'll see about updating my local git tree and building a new kernel. 
With the x86 merger if it's fixed in 32bit it is probably also fixed in 
64bit.
The other problems are a bigger concern, though. I don't like seeing warnings 
in my logs - makes me worry about the long-term stability of my systems. And 
with the apparent problem in libata I'm not too sure I will be able to 
successfully boot into a new kernel - after all, the system just spins on 
trying and retrying the drive without any progress. (And it seems random, 
though it does appear that the trick to a successful boot is to get the 
hardware completely powered down - in other words, a completely cold boot)
