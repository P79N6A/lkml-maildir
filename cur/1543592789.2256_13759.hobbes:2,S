	If I were you, I would fix gcc rather than making my code
unreadable.
	I write source code in C rather than coding ASM in hex because
of the semantic attached to what I write, which make the code readable
by me and by other, and make my code portable to other environments
(for example user space). Initialisating a variable to zero as opposed
to leaving it undefined has plenty of semantic attached to it.
	It's the job of the compiler to make sure that all this kind
of stupid optimisation are done and the code produced is as efficient
as possible and adapted to the exact characteristics of the operating
envirtonment. Especially that it's probably 10 lines to add the proper
option to gcc command line.
	Therefore, Alan, please do not apply those kind of patches to
my drivers.
	Thanks...
	Jean
