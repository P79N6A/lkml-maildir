One of the results of the mac reset is that the device reassociates with 
the access point. You might just have lost your link with it and for 
some reason automagic reassociation goes wrong or doesn't happen at all....
When the link is gone can you look what the BSSID is with iwconfig?
If this is the problem there isn't much the driver can do... This is all 
done by firmware. (One hack might be to have a timer do a mac_reset 
every once in a while if the link is gone)
