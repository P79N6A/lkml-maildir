Of course is arg 4 in r10.

That's the prototype in process.c.  From the user level it is
int clone(int flags, unsigned long newsp, void *parent_tid, void
*child_tid, void *tlsaddr)

You don't get it.  The parameter which is passed on is the TLS address
which does not appear in the parameter list but is passed in the *fifth*
parameter.  TLS address != child_tid!  The patch is correct and
regardless of what ak said, please apply it.  Unlike ak's claims it is
actually tested.  I'm running such a kernel and threads actually work
(unlike with the original kernel).
