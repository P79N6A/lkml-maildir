Given the constraints of having properly aligned data on an SMP machine with 
the correct cache-coherency hardware, then yes, I will agree that such stores 
should be atomic. However, it has been my understanding that these conditions 
cannot be guaranteed on every architecture. Thus we're stuck with atomic_t's 
so everyone can play nicely together.
