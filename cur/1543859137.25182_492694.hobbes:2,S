We are talking about two different possible copyright claims. One is the
person who aggregates the works who may try to claim a "compilation
copyright" in the aggregate. The other is the authors of the original works
who may try to claim that the aggregate is a derivative work.

First sale is exactly what this is about. Nobody needs to make "additional
copies" of the Linux kernel because I can download a thousand of them from a
computer operated by the guy in the office down the hall from me.

Good, so we agree that aggregate is not a derivative work. That means it
doesn't have to be GPL'd even if some of its component works are GPL'd.

I don't see why you can't distribute a single DVD that combines the contents
of the two you bought, so long as you destroy the originals. There is no
issue about the number of copies with the GPL because you can download any
number of copies of a GPL'd work from someone else who provides you with
source.

I think it depends upon how small the pieces are. If you rearranged them
creatively, and the result was in effect a single work, I think it would be
a derivative work.

I mean that you can't link together a bunch of works that would otherwise be
independent and get a derivative work as a result. Linking combines
mechanistically, not creatively, so it aggregates.
