My apologies -- the kernel I'm dealing with is 2.2.12.  I'm 
doing the builds on a P II and the test machine is a PPro.  
I've got the config set for PPro/6x86mx so my compile command lines
look like this:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/tmk/kernels/epcm/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -g  -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686   -c -o prefetch.o prefetch.c
I have declared a global variable 
Predictions preds[MAX_PARTITIONS];  /* MAX_PARTITIONS = 255 */
could this be the source of my trouble?
Thanks,
