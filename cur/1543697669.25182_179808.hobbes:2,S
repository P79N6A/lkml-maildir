The kernel is actually very good at getting the PCI irq's right - if it
doesn't, _no_ PCI card will function right. This is definitely not a
"Cardbus is special" issue - the irq routing tables are used for every
single thing out there.
And in fact your tables seem to have the thing:

Can you enable DEBUG in "arch/i386/pci/pci.h"?
AHH.. I think I know what's up. Your PIRQ table is fine, but your MP table
probably doesn't translate the legacy IRQ into the APIC one.
You may be able to boot a UP kernel properly, but I'm sure that the MP
thing is solvable too. Send the whole dmesg out, with DEBUG enabled both
in pci.h and in "include/asm-i386/apic.h".
