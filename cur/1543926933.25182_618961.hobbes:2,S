Well, it doesn't seem so.

True, but does it actually happen in practice?

I hope somebody knows. :-)
At this point the second branch of the "if (as->suspend_state == SUSPEND_READ)"
can be fixed by replacing wait_event_interruptible() with
wait_event_freezable(), but the fix for the first branch depends on whether or
not the wait_event() is really necessary.
If it can be replaced with an interruptible sleep, we can use
wait_event_freezable() in this case too.  Otherwise, the only woking fix would
be to reintroduce the PF_NOFREEZE in there.
Honestly, I'm leaning towards replacing wait_event() in apm_ioctl() with
wait_event_freezable() and seeing what happens ...
