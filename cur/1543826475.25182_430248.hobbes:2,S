Problem is, the strings are (possibly) still not zero-terminated:
strncpy() only appends zeroes if src contents are short enough; if they
are not, dest is only zero-terminated if dest[sizeof(dest)-1] was zero
before.
strlcpy() semantics promise more sanity; dest is always zero-terminated
(if its size is >= 1), and the size parameter holds total dest size.
(See lib/string.c for more details.)
Kind regards,
 Horst
