Hi,
The Megaraid-scsi driver defines SCB_COMPLETE as 0x4 while the Initio
INI-A100 defines it as 0x00. (megaraid.h vs inia100.h in drivers/scsi)
If both cards are selected, drivers/scsi/hosts.c includes both
header-files. Should this clash be resolved or is it just harmless?
Greetings,
  Arjan van de Ven
