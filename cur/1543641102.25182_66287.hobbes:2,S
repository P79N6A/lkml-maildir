So those apps are broken. They don't work on pretty common hardware.
NUMA-Q is just another kind of hardware where broken applications
break. What's the problem?

No. rdtsc is still usefull if you are clever and statistically filter
out. Also rdtsc provides you number of cycles, so if you want to know
how many cycles mov %eax,%ebx takes, you can do that even on
speedstep. Anything that correlates rdtsc to real time is broken, however.
