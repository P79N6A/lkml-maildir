I just became aware of this thread.  Dave, if you want a login so you can
poke around, let me know.  The config on our end is
Linux hostme 2.4.5 #1 Mon May 28 10:54:32 PDT 2001 i686 unknown
  6:45am  up 54 days, 16:17,  3 users,  load average: 1.39, 1.88, 2.06
I poked around in the logs and didn't see anything obvious.
