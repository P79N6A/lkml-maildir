Indeed.  But this brings us to an intersting dilemma.  What is a
userspace program to do when it wants to build an LPF and attach it to a
socket?  It needs the definitions in <linux/filter.h> to build the
filter.

Uggh!  Does this not sound like a deficiency in the kernel interface to
you?  I really shouldn't have to do either of these.  There should be a
"userspace" version of the required data structures shouldn't there?

Cool.  Will look into this.
Thanks very much for your insight on this matter.
