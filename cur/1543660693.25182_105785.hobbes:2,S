The truth is few (broken wrt the FHS) programs actually write to /etc. I
have set up everything so nothing is written to in /etc, and it actually
works very well (have to use a special init(8) that doesn't write to
/etc/ioctl.save). This setup has been running for almost a year now,
with the locking problem being the only one left to fix.

Well, mounting root read-only is a good idea but it sacrifices being
able to administer the system from any station, and it also puts a lot
of burden on me to fix *all* programs to not write to anywhere on it.
This shouldn't be too hard, but we're still just working around the bug,
which I would really like to identify and fix.

I am 100% positive statd runs on every single client. This problem here
only happens spuriously.  It goes away when I restart nfsd and mountd
(in that order). It really does look like a bug <wink>

Nope. I've just tested and the default (specifying no lock option upon
bootup) really is nolock:
/dev/root on / type nfs (rw,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,udp,nolock,addr=192.168.99.4)
I wonder why you can't do locking on NFS root (if it's a current
limitation of if it doesn't make sense). 
But I also think this problem shouldn't be happening if no locking was
going on. And when I checked using nlm_debug it sure did seem locking
was being used. What do you make of it?
Take care,
