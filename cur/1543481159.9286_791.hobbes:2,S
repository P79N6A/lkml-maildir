I personally like blocking system calls.  They fit in far better for the
application
model I use.  We have multiple threads, and it is easier to block.  We
in fact
don't use the non blocking I/O calls in win32 because it is easier for
us at least 
to use blocking ones.  Yes, async IO can be nice for certain things, but
saying
blocking system calls are a bad idea is crap.

actually, no... windows apps break because Microsoft has lots of "that
was a documentation error" or "we meant that API to behave in that broke
manner"

I think this kind of boils down to user vs. kernel API issues.  why not
great this
all new wonderful API set in a user space lib? I really like that the
kernel API in linux is small compared to the kernel API in win32.  I
quite a bit about the win32 API, but the most important thing I know, is
that it is a big ugly mess, and I don't think linux should head in that
direction.
I still like the old principle, of if you can do it in user space, then
do it in user space.
