Yes.  But with /dev/tty1 being the controlling terminal in both cases,
as you haven't dropped your session, or disassociated your tty.
The bash problem may have something to setpgid or scheduling effects.
Hmm.  I just looked and setpgid does grab the tasklist lock for
writing so we may possibly have some contention there.

Yep.  If we can narrow it down to one that would be interesting.  Of course
that also means when we start finding other possibly sleeping problems people
are working in areas of code the don't normally touch, so we must investigate.

It looks like there is a call to schedule_work.
There are two pieces of the path. If you are switching in and out of a tty
controlled by something like X.  User space has to grant permission before
the operation happens.  Where there isn't a gate keeper I know it is cheaper
but I don't know by how much, I suspect there is still a schedule happening
in there.
