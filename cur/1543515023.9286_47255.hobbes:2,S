The less time spent holding sleep locks the better.  calling lots of
redundant sync code to release a bndle of IO requests is dumb if you can
release them in batch.  NT uses something called MDL lists that allow
multiple requests for a file to be transacted accross several processors
at the same time, reducing latency.
