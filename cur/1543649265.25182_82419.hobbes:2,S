      IOW if binutils goes off in a direction 
    you don't like, for example the FSF changes the license from GPL to 
    Microsoft EULA, you don't have any say in the matter whatsoever.
FSF copyright assignments place a number of limits on how the FSF can
use the code, including limits on what sort of licenses we can use.
If we did what you have in mind, we would be violating all these
contracts (as well as our charter).  I wrote the contracts this way so
that contributors would not have to rely entirely on our good
intentions.
