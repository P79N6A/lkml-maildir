Tim,
Thanks for the input.
Sadly, it didn't work. I tried the SCSI emulation (which I already had running
on the CD-ROM, which works), but it fails for the tape.
With SCSI emulation turned on, the system recognizes the tape drive as SCSI. 
However, an attempt at the following command:
mt -f /dev/st0 rewind
yields the following errors:
May 10 07:49:33 isaiah kernel: st0: Error with sense data: [valid=0] Info
fld=0x0,
Current st09:00: sense key Illegal Request 
May 10 07:49:33 isaiah kernel: Additional sense indicates Invalid command
operation code 
This all works OK in kernel 2.2.17. But it fails in 2.4.4.
