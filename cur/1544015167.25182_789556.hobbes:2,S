Nice, thanks Evgeniy. So it makes sense to move only the !timeo test
above since it's not dependant on the socket, and leave the rest of
the test where it currently is. That's what Eric has proposed in his
latest patch.
Well, I'm now trying to educate myself on the send part. It's still
not very clear to me and I'd like to understand a little bit better
why we have this corruption problem and why there is a difference
between sending segments from memory and sending them from another
socket where they were already waiting.
I think I'll put printks everywhere and see what I can observe.
Knowing about the GSO/SG workaround already helps me enable/disable
the bug.
