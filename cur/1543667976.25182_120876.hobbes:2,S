They may be mainboard specific. The formulae rely on *suggested*
resistor values, which the integrators may or may not follow. There
definitely is a need for userspace conversion. Libsensors needs to be
tunable by the user.
I don't know about the kernel conversion Jan is talking about (never
coded a sensor driver myself), so I can't talk about this half, but I'm
pretty sure you shouldn't even think of moving all conversions into
kernel space.
Mark, Phil, maybe you could explain the reasons better than I would?
