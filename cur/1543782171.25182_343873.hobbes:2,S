See chapter "2.2. AIO completion event".
The libposix-aio written by Sébastien and I manages all these cases:
http://www.bullopensource.org/posix/
There is a patch allowing kernel to send signal to a given process on
aio event completion:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/paiol/kernel-patches/2.6.12/aioevent.patch?rev=1.1.1.1&view=auto
With the help of an helper thread in the user space, the libposix-aio is
able to manage SIGEV_THREAD and create new thread by using user space
code (and thus implementation dependent calls):
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/paiol/libposix-aio/src/aio_read.c?view=markup
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/paiol/libposix-aio/src/aio_thread_create.c?view=markup
Sébastien wrote this part of libposix-aio (So I'm not an expert on this
part :-P ), but I think his helper thread is made like the glibc timer
helper thread is made. And thus, if we want to merge libposix-aio in
glibc, we should use existing mechanism, and it should be easy to put
POSIX AIO helper thread portions inside the timer helper thread.
But only the glibc maintainer can answer to this question: 
should we mixe timer and AIO code ?
