One thing which could remedy this is using the KDB. (kernel debugger) If
you get the -aa series kernels/patches you can get this functionality.
(Dunno if -ac has it built it). Once the machine crashes, as long as
it's not a black screen, then you can get a back-trace on the process
and even possibly find the section of code that's actually causing the
problem right off the bat,(not usual and YMMV), though probably not, but
it's an enormous amount of info that you can't get ATM.
