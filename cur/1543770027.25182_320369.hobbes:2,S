Just thinking loud here:
When looking at patch v2, the read split is done in do_generic_mapping_read
vs do_xip_mapping read. In the write path, the split is at
generic_file_xip_write,
generic_file_buffered_write and generic_file_direct_write.
How about abstracting on that interface? Like make those become address
space operations. This way, the filesystems could select the corresponding
function. No need to distinguish between xip, direct_IO, and classic
readpage/writepage in the generic code anymore.
Would this go in the direction you're thinking Suparna? Is it worth a
try to see
how it comes out? Opinions anyone?
cheers,
Carsten
