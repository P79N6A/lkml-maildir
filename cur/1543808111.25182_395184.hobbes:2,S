This sched.c bit breaks Xen, and probably also other architectures
that have CPU hotplug.  I suspect the reason is that during early 
bootup only the boot CPU is online, so nothing initialises the
runqueues for CPUs that are brought up afterwards.
I suspect we can get rid of this problem quite easily by moving
runqueue initialisation to init_idle()...
