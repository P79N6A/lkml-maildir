The bridge appears to corrupt the subvendor/device ids on next boot.  We have found a software work around in that I can write to the bridge on module exit and it will always detect correctly next boot (through module_exit when rmmod'd).

It's only called when the module is explicitely unloaded.
You can use register_reboot_notifier() though.
