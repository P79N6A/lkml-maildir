I'm afraid there isn't much here to base any guesses on.

blk_remove_plug is always called with interrupts disabled.  So why
there are "do_IRQ" and similar calls further up the stack is
surprising.
However the list of function names is only indicative, not
definitive....

This shows that it died on a "BUG" or "BUG_ON" call.  Did you see the
text of that?
Why do you say there was "a kernel panic in queue_delayed_work_on".
What exactly provided that information?
