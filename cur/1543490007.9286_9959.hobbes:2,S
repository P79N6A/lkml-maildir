I have serious problem with netatalk and dual-processor too...
I just upgrade to 2.2.3, I'll see if this is okay in some days...
The server just stops to work, no video wake-up, no server in chooser
just plugged in !
I think this is a dual-proc issue instead of a 2.2.3 issue...
One more thing, I had serious problems too with afp support and
ipfirewalling...
