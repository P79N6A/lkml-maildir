True. Just a stab in the dark - leaving KOBJ_NAME_LEN == 20 and
initializing the first four and last four bytes of the KOBJ_NAME_LEN
sized buffer with a counter starting at 0 might also prove very
interesting and could help resolve the Oops with the driver built in.
Motivation: Somehow, the disaster smells like somebody uses a hardcoded
offset designed to work only if KOBJ_NAME_LEN == 16.
I would provide a patch, but I don't have the source handy right now due
to disk space constraints.

Carl-Daniel
