ah, indeed i missed that mail - the response to the patches was quite 
overwhelming (and i naively thought people dont do Linux hacking over 
the weekends anymore ;).
so Linus was right: this was caused by scheduler starvation. I can see 
one immediate problem already: the 'nice offset' is not divided by 
nr_running as it should. The patch below should fix this but i have yet 
to test it accurately, this change might as well render nice levels 
unacceptably ineffective under high loads.
