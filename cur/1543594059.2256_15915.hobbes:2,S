If you havily create threads under load you're rather srewed.  If you want
to stay with the (IMHO rather suboptimal) posix threads API you might want
to take a look at the stuff IBM has produced:
	
http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/pthreads/
Otherwise a simple wrapper for clone might be a _lot_ faster, but has it's
own disadvantages: no ready-to-use lcoking primitives, no cross-platform
support (ok, it should be portable to the FreeBSD rfork easily).

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
