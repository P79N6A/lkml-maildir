Not for me. I have lots of these errors on a dual port 82557 eepro100 with
both ports extremely busy, when running ifconfig just to dump the
stats. And the ports continued running just fine after the errors. I.e. I
didn't need to down/up the interfaces.. If you look at the code, there is
a possibility there to restart the receiver and _not_ to do so. Perhaps in
your case it restarts it and in mine, it doesn.
Is there a datasheet for eepro100 (or at least for 82557 chipset?)
somewhere? It would be interesting to understand what status 8 actually
means.
