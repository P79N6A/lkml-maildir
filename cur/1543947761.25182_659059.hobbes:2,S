(Can't comment, I never understood this security magic, but Eric's
 explanation looks very reasonable to me).
I just have an almost off-topic (sorry ;) question. Do we really need
kill_pid_info_as_uid() ? Harald Welte cc'ed.

The problems 1) and 2) are solved by converting to a struct pid. Is 3) a real
problem? The task which does ioctl(USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB) explicitly asks to send
the signal to it, should we deny the signal even if it changes its credentials
in some way?
Just curious. Thanks,
Oleg.
