So it took 7 times more processors to increase the performance gain by
just over 3 on a microscopic synthetic benchmark.  That's not
impressive at all.
And you still haven't shown what happens for the workloads I
suggested.  A web benchmark, with say a thousand unique clients, would
be sufficient for one of those btw.  That case has very low dst
locality, yet dsts are useful because you'll have about 2 or 3
concurrent connections per dst.
