HP-UX defines the following:
   struct ipc_perm {
#    ifdef _CLASSIC_ID_TYPES
        unsigned short  filler_uid;
        unsigned short  uid;    /* owner's user id */
        unsigned short  filler_gid;
        unsigned short  gid;    /* owner's group id */
        unsigned short  filler_cuid;
        unsigned short  cuid;   /* creator's user id */
        unsigned short  filler_cgid;
        unsigned short  cgid;   /* creator's group id */
#    else
        uid_t           uid;    /* owner's user id */
        gid_t           gid;    /* owner's group id */
        uid_t           cuid;   /* creator's user id */
        gid_t           cgid;   /* creator's group id */
#    endif
but I don't know about other SysV ports.
I don't think that it is a good idea to tack new fields on past the end of
the old structures, though, because new function calls are going to be
needed anyway (there isn't enough space left in the old structures).
Leaving the old fields around in a new structure would just be dead
weight, since new programs won't ever use them.
