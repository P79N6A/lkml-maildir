No, that is not what "pass by reference" means. You are thinking of
"const", maybe, or "pass by value"; this is neither.  The arg is not 
declared const, the subroutine can (and usually will) modify the contents 
of the structure, and so the caller will be holding a modified structure
when the callee returns (just like it would if a pointer was passed).
