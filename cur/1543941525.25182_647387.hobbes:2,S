seems this will go away.
recent vmware versions (e.g. server 2.0 beta) have a fuse based replacement for that.
ldd /usr/bin/vmware-mount
        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xffffe000)
        libz.so.1 => /lib/libz.so.1 (0xb7f95000)
! ->  libfuse.so.2 => /lib/libfuse.so.2 (0xb7f79000)   
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0xb7f61000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0xb7f5d000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7e1c000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7fbd000)
        librt.so.1 => /lib/librt.so.1 (0xb7e13000)
i`m not sure if this is the perfect approach (slower....) , but at least that shouldn`t have those stability issues as the nbd one.
i always felt uncomfortable with the nbd approach...that`s why i started the following discussion-thread: 
http://communities.vmware.com/message/854746
anyway, i can see a point to use nbd locally, but i think it shouldn`t be abused for mapping local disk-images of any kind, even if this has better capabilities than loop or other. why should local disk data be sent trough the network layer? isn`t device-mapper the better infrastructure here?

maybe dm-loop does?
