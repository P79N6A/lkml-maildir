I put a ndelay(400) at the head of cdrom_newpc_intr and the problem of DRQ 
being set when there was no data to transfer disappeared.  It appears that my 
hardware is too slow.
I have been reading the ATA/ATAPI - 6 spec, and it implies that the state of 
DRQ line need one pio cycle before being correct and that you should read the 
alternative status register to achieve this.  I tried a simple
HWIF(drive)->INB( IDE_ALTSTATUS_REG);
But that made no difference.
