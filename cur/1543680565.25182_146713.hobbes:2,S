Where did you get that the "loss was due to a lack of registration" ?

Andre is formaly registering the copyright, so that the lawyers will 
take the case. Without it, in the US at least, the case will never be 
heard. Andre has stated this case will be heard, so the GPL will be 
tested in court. The loss would not be related to registration.
