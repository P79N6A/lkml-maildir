Well, gcc 3.2.2 with -Winline does not complain, but interestingly 
enough sparse does (at least in the above case and some others):
  CHECK   arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_tsc.c
arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_tsc.c:30:39: warning: marked inline, but without a definition
Basically this is a case of having:
        #1:     static inline void foo(void); /* forward decl without body */
        ...
        #2:     void bar(void) { foo(); } /* function using the inline */
        ...
        #3:     static inline void foo(void) { return; } /* actual inline def. */
in the above order.
I have not looked at resulting .o file with gcc 3.2.2, but would not be too
surprised if it also silently just ignores the "inline" in lines #1 and #3 above.
There are obviously two trivial fixes above, either just remove the inline (making
foo a normal static function) or reorder #2 and #3.
