I just did an experiment with this to see how much is on the table. I made
a file with 1024 WARN_ON()'s (new style, eg the out of line call) and 1024 BUG_ON()'s,
which on i386 already use the trap.
This shows that the BUG_ON() case is 2Kb shorter in generated code. From this 2Kb you
need to subtract all the code size that is needed to deal with the trap and the module
merging/unmerging of trap points etc etc, so lets say that a total of 1Kb is left on the table.
HOWEVER, if you have a module with, say, only 4 WARN_ON()/BUG_ON()'s, you actually LOOSE
48 bytes, because of the extra overhead of how the trap data is stored.
So... call me unconvinced for now. There's 30 Kb on the table with the easy, obviously safe
transform, and maybe another 1Kb with the much more tricky trapping scenario, but only
for the vmlinux case; the module case seems to be a loss instead.
