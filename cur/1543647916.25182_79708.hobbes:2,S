It's not really the userspace access that matters (it comes for free
when doing it properly) but more that I want to avoid duplicating
kernel-internal data structures and code.  Just look at ldev_mgr.c
in the evms source code and see how much simpler it would get if we
merged struct evms_logical_node (and it's members) into struct gendisk and
struct block_device - sure that's not a trivial task, but it'll pay
out in the long term.

It's more like ps aux showing you all threads of a multithreaded
process.  Yes, people have turned it off now, but you really want
to be able to see it without doing hacks.
