they call the section the anti-tivoization, how much more explicit can 
they get?

by the way, just in case anyone is misunderstanding me. I don't believe 
for a moment that all these anti-tamper features actually work in the real 
world (the PS3 hacking kits are proof of the lengths people will go to to 
make the 'hard' hardware-level hacking trivial to do) but the approach 
needs to be at secure modulo hardware tampering or software bugs.
