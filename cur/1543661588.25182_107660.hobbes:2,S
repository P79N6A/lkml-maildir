I have had some limited experience with an older HT capable Xeon,
that reported 1 sibling.  Essentially the result was that sending a
wakeup ipi to the next sibling was a good way to lockup the machine.
I was actually looking for the apic id of the other Xeon in the box
and was sending to the sibling by accident.
From what I can tell from various micro-benchmarks and other strange
experiences intel has had to work fairly hard to get additional
sibling CPUs to perform correctly and well.  And the development
versions that are present but disabled in older dies are not likely
to be useful.
