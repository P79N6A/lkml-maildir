I'm sorry you don't like my manpages.
I also wrote some manpages on libnetlink, but for some reason they were never
merged in the main distribution so you can only find them in the SuSE rpm
or at 
http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/man/libnetlink.3.gz
 (source)
or 
http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/man/libnetlink.3.txt
 (formatted manpage)
Jamal Hadi wrote a ietf draft on netlink.  I don't know if it's publicly
available (if yes probably somewhere on ftp.ietf.org) it describes quite 
a lot of basic concepts in netlink/rtnetlink although in a bit foreign 
to linux terminology.
I also did a presentation on netlink and related topics at previous to
last year's Ottawa Linux symposium which may be also helpful. The slides
are at
