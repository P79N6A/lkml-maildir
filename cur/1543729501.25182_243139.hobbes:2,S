That would not provide enough info for the driver.

I believe correct fix for #2 is what I've done. Pass enum system_state
down to driver, and make them use to_pci_state() helper. Fix of driver
then looks like:

Okay, I did not do this one. I'll probably just fix those drivers that
care, instead. The rest of patch was pretty much same as mine patch,
except:

this is no longer neccessary. -mm swsusp already uses right constants.
