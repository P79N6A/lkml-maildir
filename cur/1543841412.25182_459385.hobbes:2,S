or you could argue that the addition of a space (i.e. v. 2) would be
correct since its an abbreviation, but point taken and I'll clean it up
shortly.

Ok. I'll take a look and see which of them are not required.

They are not on-disk visible (they'd in in gfs2_ondisk.h otherwise) but
we may well want to change them as I think it should be possible to
merge the gh_flags and gh_iflags fields in the struct gfs2_holder to
save a bit of space.

Its related to the way the GFS2's fuzzy quota system works. In order to
avoid contention on a global quota structure, each node has its own
which is synced back to the master one from time to time. This is done
according to user specified constants and more frequently in the case of
users nearing their quota. In the default case this means that no user
can exceed their quota by more than twice, in practice a user would have
to work very hard to manage even that.
As a result there are the overall user/group limits and the local
differences which are saved to by synced back to the master quota
information, hence four of them.

It isn't an on-disk structure, on the other hand  we treat it as one. It
probably ought to be changed to use __be types. Its the structure which
the quota code keeps in the lock value block of DLM locks, so it is
directly shared between nodes, hence the need to treat it the same as
the on-disk structures in terms of making any changes to it, and keeping
it aligned, and of defined byte order etc,
