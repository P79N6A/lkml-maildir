No, the hardware DMA engine's software interface, doesn't sleep
nor relinquish the CPU. But there are other spots where we do sleep
interruptibly.

No, this is fine, just avoid designing the kthread stop mechanism
to require a thread being requested to stop to actually stop in some
finite amount of time, and that by it not stopping other kthread stop
requests are held off. Allow the thread to take as much time as it needs
to respond to the kthread stop request.

I was aware of this behavior of kthread_create(), which I consider
'halting' in that the thread doing the kthread_create() blocks waiting
for kthreadd to get scheduled, call kernel_thread(), and then call
complete(). By your mentioning a 'non-halting' kthread_create() I
thought you were planning to create a new flavor of kthread_create()
that called kernel_thread() directly and reparented the child thread to
kthreadd. My mistake.
So there will be more overhead (time-wise) for XPC in calling
kthread_run() as opposed to it formerly calling kernel_thread() directly.
Thus requiring XPC to utilize a pool of kthread_create()'d threads.

This means that XPC will have to retain its thread pool, but I can
understand you not wanting to go there.
