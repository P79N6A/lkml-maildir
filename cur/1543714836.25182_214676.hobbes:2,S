The only way is by searching the interface list.  That was part of the 
reason I left findintfif() alone rather than replacing it with a call to 
usb_ifnum_to_if().

It's true that code is generally cleaner using numbers rather than
indices, and that's how I've been modifying the USB drivers when they need
it.  In general I would expect an interface number to be not much larger 
than the index (i.e., normally not many numbers will be skipped), so the 
bitmask size should be adequate in either case.  We probably don't have to 
worry about trying to support devices with a single interface numbered 77 
-- but if you wanted to then you'd have to use the index.
