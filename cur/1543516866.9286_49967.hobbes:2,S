Hi Richard,
If you (or anyone else who sees it) are willing to go after the cause
of this...
Grab ikd for 2.2.13 amd apply it ignoring the two rejects.  Then, apply
this on top of it.

Save your .config, make mrproper (otherwise, you'll have module symbol
troubles) and rebuild with memleak enabled.  If finding the caller isn't
enough, contact me offline and I'll show you a couple of easy ways to
get spiffy call trace info. (or just look at ktrace and/or kdb source:)
