This is all most enlightening. If I am understanding correctly then every
device driver that the author specifies to use a "mem=" command to 
reserve some memory for said drivers use at the upper part of physical
memory is stuffed by design. 
I thought it was a valid technique? I never questioned it because there is
a history of its use -I think the early bttv driver was written this way.
I have been debugging an oops on a system which uses the open source
driver for the Matrox MeteorII multichannel available from,
http://www.emlix.com/index.php?id=158
This driver uses the technique and I am getting a corrupted slab free list. 
Ross B, could I please have details of your mem bios hack please so I can try
it as a workaround.
