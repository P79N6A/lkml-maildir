Can someone explain this address space collision to me and offer an 
explanation on how to resolve it?
 From dmesg:
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Probing PCI hardware (bus 00)
PCI: Address space collision on region 7 of bridge 0000:00:04.3 
[e400:e43f]
PCI: Address space collision on region 8 of bridge 0000:00:04.3 
[e800:e81f]
PCI: Using IRQ router PIIX/ICH [8086/7110] at 0000:00:04.0
Thanks.
Lee.
