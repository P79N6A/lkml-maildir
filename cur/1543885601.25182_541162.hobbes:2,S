Your patch looks good, thanks for working on this.  As other's
have mentioned you should provide a proper "Signed-off-by: "
line with your patch changelog as describe in
linux/Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
I wonder if there is a way to get rid of all of that MIE twiddling
logic during the probe.
The chicken-and-egg problem in this driver is that we need to get
all the chips mostly functional before we let the IRQ handler get
at the chips in the sunzilog_irq_chain.  That list is setup very
early, so it isn't a datastructure problem.
One thing we could do is check in the IRQ handler is skip chips
which don't have their registers mapped yet.
But that'd put silly logic in the fast path of this driver, whereas
your solution does all of this out-of-line.  So your patch is
probably the best.
Please resubmit with the proper "Signed-off-by: " line and I will
apply your patch, thanks!
