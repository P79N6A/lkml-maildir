This reminded me of an old bug which apparently still hasn't been
fixed (not in 2.2 at least). In init/main.c we have:
extern int rd_image_start;	/* starting block # of image */
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
kdev_t real_root_dev;
#endif
#endif
int root_mountflags = MS_RDONLY;
and then in kernel/sysctl.c:
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
	{KERN_REALROOTDEV, "real-root-dev", &real_root_dev, sizeof(int),
	 0644, NULL, &proc_dointvec},
#endif
Because rd_image_start and root_mountflags are both int-aligned,
this happens to work on little endian platforms. On big endian
platforms however writing a value in the range 0-65535 to 
/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev will place 0 in real_root_dev,
and the actual value in the two padding bytes...
(Yes, I'm one of the few that have actually used this feature. ;-)
Unfortunately proc_dointvec() doesn't support shorts, so what is
the correct fix? Changing:
kdev_t real_root_dev;
into
int real_root-dev;
is a perfectly working solution, but is it acceptable?
