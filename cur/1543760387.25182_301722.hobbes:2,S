I've just been using sort by arrival as an imperfect, but still mostly
correct work-around (a few things have shown up after the email with the
tag, but only a few).  I'd argue having the mails have the fuged date is
useful when trying to re-create sub-sets of a given tree.
Note that for the specific problem Ben has (looking at all ChangeSets
from A to B), I've got a kinda slow script that fakes the bk-commits
messages given two repositories, if this sounds of any interest to
anyone.
