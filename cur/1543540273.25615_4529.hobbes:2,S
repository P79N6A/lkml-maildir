Sometimes it is needed to let one PCI device do DMA to another part of
itself or another PCI device.  For this, you need the bus addresses of
the PCI memory resources.  If pci_resource_start(dev,x) doesn't give
you that, where else could it be found?  By doing configure space reads
I guess, but is that really necessary?
