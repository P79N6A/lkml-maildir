Hello,
I have fish-fillets game ported to linux. Under 2.6.9-rc1-bk9 it eats up to 10%
with normal speed of game and up to 40% with fast mode.
Under 2.6.9-rc1-mm4 it eats up to 40% with normal speed of game and cpu is too
slow for fast mode.
Any ideas?
For both kernels I use almost the same .config.
