yes.  It's ETHTOOL_GPERMADDR to the ethtool ioctl.
        case ETHTOOL_GPERMADDR:
                rc = ethtool_get_perm_addr(dev, useraddr);
                break;
When the driver is first loaded, before ifconfig can change the MAC
address, the existing (permanent) MAC address is stored away, able to
be retrieved via this ioctl.  Jon Wetzel, a Dell intern of a few
summers ago, wrote the code and was able to have it included.
Thanks,
Matt
