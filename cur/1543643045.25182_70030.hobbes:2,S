Hmm, ok I'll try and reproduce it here then.

rq->bio must not be zeroed or free'd or anything like that. ok I see
what happens now. does this patch work for you? just back out the other
patch first (well you don't have to, but might as well).
# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
# Project Name: Linux kernel tree
# This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#	           ChangeSet	1.639   -> 1.640  
#	 include/linux/bio.h	1.17    -> 1.18   
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 02/09/11	axboe@burns.home.kernel.dk	1.640
# clean up with bio_kmap_irq() thing properly. remove the micro optimization
# of _not_ calling kmap_atomic() if this isn't a highmem page. we could
# keep that and do the inc_preempt_count() ourselves, but I'm not sure
# it's worth it and this is cleaner.
