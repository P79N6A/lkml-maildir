	Perhaps I'm missing something. Can you explain why you think that matters?
I'll repeat the GPL section I'm talking about:
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.
	First, this says, "any work", it's not limited to code. It says, "in whole
or in part contains or is derived from the Program" -- a binary of the Linux
kernel is clearly derived from the Linux kernel source. And it says
"licensed *as a whole* ... under the terms of *this* license".
	So where's the gray area you seem to be imagining?

	This is a different issue. This isn't about distributing firmware and
whether the firmware itself is a derived work. This is about distributing
the Linux kernel as a work containing non-GPL'd elements with use
restrictions. GPL section 2b authoritatively prohibits this. There is no
gray area here.
	This is a clear issue, but not a technical one. However, being unable to
distribute binaries of the Linux kernel would present numerous technical
problems.
