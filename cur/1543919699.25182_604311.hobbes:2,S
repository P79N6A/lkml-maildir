Subject: [PATCH 3/7] IPMI: documentation fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>
Clean up IPMI documentation to remove references to high-res timers
and add info about the polling thread.  Also fix an doc error for a
parameter.
Not needed for the stable kernel.

+If your IPMI interface does not support interrupts and is a KCS or
+SMIC interface, the IPMI driver will start a kernel thread for the

 these interfaces suck.
 
 The driver supports a hot add and remove of interfaces.  This way,
 interfaces can be added or removed after the kernel is up and running.
