| It didn't help.  The original oops says the problem was in strcmp.  It
| was a GPF, which suggests to me that one of the arguments is NULL. 
| Since ops->name is checked at the beginning of the function, the only
| other possibility is that alg->ops->name is NULL.  I added a bit of code
| to check for this, and it turns out that one of the strings was indeed
| NULL.  I didn't know where to go from there in debugging, but I hope it
| helps.

thanks, i do know that problem is in strcmp, i just thought the reason
of bug was a delayed procedure execution 'case of missing mutex unlock.
Have to dig deeper ;)
