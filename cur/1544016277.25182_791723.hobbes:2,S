If you don't use ftrace_bprintk(), the file trace_bprintk_formats is empty.
This file record all formats which ftrace_bprintk() uses.
You can use ftrace_bprintk() everywhere as another printk().
Patch #5 enables binary printk for markers, this is another additional tool
for tracing markers.

Patch#5 does it as you said.
