I'm not convinced that exposing the pin number to drivers is the way to
go. The pin numbers themselves are rarely portable across "similar" CPUs
with identical peripherals, while the pin function itself may be
portable (or simply unecessary). Pin muxing also needs to be handled in a
much more transparent and intelligent fashion, which is something else
that is fairly easy to do when looking at a symbolic name for the pin
function rather than the pin # itself.
Exposing the pin # abstraction any higher than the CPU-specific code
hidden away in an architecture backend is just asking for abuse,
specifically for drivers that are shared across different architectures
(or where the peripheral may only be conditionally hooked to a GPIO or
require demuxing).
Any API also needs to allow for multiple GPIO controllers, as it's rarely
just the CPU that has these or needs to manipulate them.
