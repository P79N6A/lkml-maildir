The issue is -- how do you safely replace the outb pre-loops_per_jiffy 
calibration? I'm currently running with the attached hack (not submitted, 
only for 32-bit and discussion) the idea of which might be the best we can do?
(And the broken is the hardware that can't take writes to port 0x80, not the 
other way around. It's a well-known legacy PC thing).
Rene.
