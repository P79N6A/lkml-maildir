Hi  All,
	I am porting an Threading Application from Hp-UX 11.0 
to Red Hat Linux 6.2. There is a system call pthread_condattr_setpshared 
and pthread_mutex_setpshared in HP-UX which is not available on Linux.
So please let me know how to implement the functionality of these 
funtions in Red Hat Linux 6.2. These functions are used to set the 
process shared attribute in a condition and mutex variable attributes
 object.
Thanks in Advance 
Sachin
