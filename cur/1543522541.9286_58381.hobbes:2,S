From ANSI 6.3.7 "Bitwise shift operators":
$ The result of E1 << E2 is E1 left-shifted E2 bit positions;
$ vacated bits are filled with zeros.  If E1 has an unsigned type,
$ the value of the result is E1 multiplied by the quantity, 2
$ raised to the power E2, reduce modulo ULONG_MAX+1 if E1 has type
$ unsigned long, UINT_MAX+1 if otherwise.
