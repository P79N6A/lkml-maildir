That sounds like a rather fragile approach to avoiding a minimal amount of 
work.  Debug exceptions don't occur very often, and when they do it won't 
matter too much if we go through some extra notifier-chain callouts.

It turns out that this won't work correctly unless I use something
stronger, like a spinlock or RCU.  Either one seems like overkill.
Is there any way to find out from within the
switch_to_thread_hw_breakpoint routine whether the task is in this unusual
state?  (By which I mean the task is being debugged and the debugger
hasn't told it to start running.)  Would (tsk->exit_code == SIGKILL) work?  
If not, can we add a TIF_DEBUG_STOPPED flag?  Or should I just go with a 
spinlock?
Is SIGKILL the only way this can happen?
In a similar vein, I need a reliable way to know whether a task has gone 
through exit_thread().  If it has, then its hw_breakpoint area has been 
deallocated and a new one must not be allocated.  Will (tsk->flags & 
PF_EXITING) always be true once that happens?
