does anyone know details about Pioneer DVD-303S drive how to set 
the read speed for DVD media ?
with CDROM media I get up to 4.6MB/sec (32x) as specified and expected, 
but when reading DVD media I only get sustained 2.7 MB/sec (2x) for the 
whole disc whereas that drive should be 2x-6x (up to 8.1 MB/sec) for DVDs.
does anyone have techincal/scsi docs for that drive ?
I'm not subscribed to linux-scsi, so please send answers as Cc: to me.
thanks!
Harald
