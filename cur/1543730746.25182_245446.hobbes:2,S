I rewrote this to get my head around it:

I think the above matches your intent, let me know if I missed
something. Note your original version would do an unlock in the
recursive invocation even if it didn't do a lock.
But I still don't like this. dev->poll() is liable to attempt to
recursively take its own driver lock again internally and we still
deadlock. Have we already seen recursion here? If we do, I think we
need to fix that in drivers. Meanwhile we should just bail here and
maybe set a "something bad happened" flag.
