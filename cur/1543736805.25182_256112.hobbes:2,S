Not sure to understand, sorry. I was talking about the cryptoswap above.
there's no reason to type a password from userspace as far as cryptoswap
is concerned, nor to attempt a decrypt. A long random key choosen by the
kernel is more secure, that will be a single key used for both encrypt
and decrypt, and it'll always work.
