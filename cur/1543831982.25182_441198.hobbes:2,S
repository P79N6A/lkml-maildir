Well, you're wrong.  They *do* do something.  They stop the compiler using the
register-relative addressing reserved for small data.  If this isn't in there,
then the linker will spit out a relocation error.
On fixed-size instruction architectures, it takes several instructions to
dereference an absolute address, so you try and squeeze all your small data
into a section of its own, plonk a register in the middle of it, and use
indirect-addressing relative to that register.  This saves you two or more
instructions and a register on each normal global variable access.
For instance, on FRV, it may change:
	sethi.p		%hi(nr_kernel_pages),gr4
	setlo		%lo(nr_kernel_pages),gr4
	ld		@(gr4,gr0),gr5
Into:
	ld		@(gr16,%gprel(nr_kernel_pages)),gr5
Small data is 1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte or 8-byte values that aren't arrays or
const.
Setting a section marker on the variable *declaration* disables the
gp-relative addressing and forces the longer absolute addressing.

That's nothing to do with my patch.

Okay, I'll fix my patch to be that instead.
