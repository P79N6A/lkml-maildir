Has anyone thought about possibly supporting the MultiBoot standard? If we
moved memory detection and such to the boot loader, we could stop having to
constantly update the kernel for that kind of thing... Plus, it uses a much
better system for passing information :)
(I wouldn't mind being able to specify the root in the bootloader without using
a root=... kernel option)
