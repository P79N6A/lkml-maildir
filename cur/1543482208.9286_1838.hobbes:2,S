Subject: [OFF-TOPIC] util-linux-2.9h released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Now that util-linux-2.9g was compromised, I released util-linux-2.9h.
Find it in [Ii]ncoming on sunsite and tsx-11. If you get it from
ftp.win.tue.nl (very unwise), check the md5sum
d98b2a08c4865c14b9aefec3586c685a  util-linux-2.9h.tar.gz
There was more stuff in the queue but I had no time to look
at everything, and some patches were too ugly.
If I missed your favourite patch, resubmit with explanation.
And avoid #ifdef's.
New: mountoption "uid=userid".
