It seems I expressed wrong. I'm worried about code duplication. Look
simple grep for memzero tells us that in particular:
...
-- arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/misc.c:110:#define memzero(s, n) memset ((s), 0, (n))
-- init/do_mounts_rd.c:279:#define memzero(s, n)     memset ((s), 0, (n))
-- init/initramfs.c:377:#define memzero(s, n)     memset ((s), 0, (n))
-- lib/inflate.c:331:  memzero(stk->c, sizeof(stk->c));
...
So instead of several 'define' that are the _same_ maybe better just use
_single common_ define? That's all I wanna ask. (Btw, it seems ARM has
a special case for memzero ;)

Quite clear, thanks. So if that is OK - I'm shutting up ;)
