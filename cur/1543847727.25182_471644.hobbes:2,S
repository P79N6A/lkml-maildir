Subject: [patch 17/19] MMC: Always use a sector size of 512 bytes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Pierre Ossman <drzeus@drzeus.cx>
Both MMC and SD specifications specify (although a bit unclearly in the MMC
case) that a sector size of 512 bytes must always be supported by the card.
Cards can report larger "native" size than this, and cards >= 2 GB even
must do so. Most other readers use 512 bytes even for these cards. We should
do the same to be compatible.
