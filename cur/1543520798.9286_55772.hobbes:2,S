But is "it wont work 100% of the time" a good enough reason to discard the
idea out of hand entirely? The fact we cant raise the bar infinitely high
means we shouldnt raise it even a little?
If thats the argument being put forth, then we might as well apply the
exact same argument to crypto and discard IDEA PGP RSA etc since none of
those are 100% of the time either (just very very hard).
