Well today I switched my workstation (128 MB RAM, 256 MB swap)
over from 2.2.19 to 2.4.14-pre6. With mozilla, netscape, postgres,
perl, apache, X, gnome running I'm usually ~80 MB into swap.
With 2.2.19 you really don't want to do this. It's *slow*.
Early 2.4.x, ditto. But under 2.4.14-pre6, it flies. I'm happy.
Mike.
