Well, it looks like I have egg on my face; it is not a kernel problem.
Return value from fcntl(F_GETFL) in decimal, hex, octal:
rufus-fd: bnet.c:84 fcntl=2050 0x802 04002
Someone is setting nonblocking on my socket ! -- perhaps some thread library?  
Anyway, it is definitely not me, and this is a thread of the main program so 
I don't see inheritance as the problem. I'll track it down and send the bug 
report to the appropriate place.
Thanks for the fast response and sorry for the inconvenience.
