Write-back with a short delay :
- no delays to the application
- ( almost ) immediate write to the physical media

OS never leaves the the medium unsynced :
 - if there are dirty buffers , keep on flushing them.
  This should not cause performance problems , because
  it happens "in the background" , except if it is a hardware
  problem , but IMO PC HW can have a floppy working with no
  big impact on the rest of the system

Solution : "uncorrupt" and sync the diskette before the LED goes
out.
