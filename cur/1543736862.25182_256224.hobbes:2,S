Well, yeah. I kinda got used to that reversed logic after a while.

Well, I understand your point, but I still think it's worth keeping the

not, THEN you (or some other reader) would get used to the
positive-style returns with the protocol detection routines and
definitely understand it wrong elsewhere.
