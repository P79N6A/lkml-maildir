After media is loaded, it takes some time for the device to get ready,
and it's supposed to raise UNIT_ATTENTION to tell the driver that media
has changed.  TUR fails with UA and sense data reports media exchanged
and the next TUR succeeds.  In SATA, you might also see unit reset UA
due to the probing sequence.  Those are why TUR is tried several times
in the first place.
So, there's nothing wrong with failing TURs, it's perfectly normal that
they fail first one or two tries.
