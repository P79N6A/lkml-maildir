yeah. I tried this and it indeed slashed 42K off text size (0.2%):
 text            data    bss     dec             filename
 20779489        6073834 3075176 29928499        vmlinux.volatile
 20736884        6073834 3075176 29885894        vmlinux.non-volatile
i booted the resulting allyesconfig bzImage and everything seems to be 
working fine. Find patch below.

remove 'volatile' from the spinlock types, it causes gcc to
generate really bad code. (and it's pointless anyway)
this reduces the non-debug SMP kernel's size by 0.2% (!).
