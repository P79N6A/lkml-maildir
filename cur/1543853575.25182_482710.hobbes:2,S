no, that's not what it does. It measures 50000000 switches of the _same_ 
selector value, without using any of the selectors in the loop itself. 
I.e. no mixing at all! But when the kernel and userspace uses %gs, it's 
the cost of switching between two selector values of %gs that has to be 
measured. Your code does not measure that at all, AFAICS.
