/etc/magic is not necessarily very slow, especially when you're
dealing with a bunch of files at once. Any library-based
implementation of "albods" uses a similar mechanism.

This is a good point. However, it may be solvable with a much simpler
kernel mechanism.

Note that all of these ideas have problems. You have to break either
"ftp" or "cat". Choose your poison, or choose to do it the Unix way --
use a user level library, and accept that the normal utilities may not
