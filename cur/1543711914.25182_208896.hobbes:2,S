I'm not following you on the "get ld.so handling free" part.  How is
that handling free?

Actually, that's something that worries me.  Somebody just needs to
succeed in loading any shared object with the right PT_GNU_STACK
header and then the entire program will be exposed to the risk of a
writable stack.  On ia64, I just don't see any need to ever implicitly
turn on execute-permission on the stack, so why allow this extra
backdoor?
