Bullshit, yep :)

On 8xx, guarded mappings seem to ensure synchronous operation of
load/store instructions.
Since the internal memory map is guarded, eieio is redudant (ie thats
why it gets away without explicit barriers now).
From MPC860UM.pdf: 5.2.5.2.1 eieio Behavior
The purpose of eieio is to prevent loads and stores from executing
speculatively when appropriate. This might be desirable for a FIFO,
where performing a read or write changes the FIFO's data. This should
not be done unless it is certain that the instruction will be completed
and not cancelled. The same function as eieio can be accomplished by
defining a memory space as having the guarded attribute in the MMU, in
which case, the eieio instruction is redundant. However, eieio could be
useful in the rare event that a region where speculative accesses are
not allowed lies in the middle of a non-guarded page.
There is nothing which prevents compiler reordering though, as Jeff
notes.

Do you think it would be worth to have lighterweight versions of
in_be32/in_le32 functions (without eieio and isync) ? Would avoid the
increase in code size and consequently cache footprint.
The IMMAP is referenced directly _all over_ the 8xx core code, must be
fixed.
