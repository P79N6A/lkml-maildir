At Plasmon we've developed a userland driver for our new UDO (Ultra
Density Optical) drive using FUSE. To avoid the complexity of
supporting a native 8KB sector size directly in kernel, we have
instead used FUSE to allow us to work on filesystems in
userland. That's made life _very_ much easier for us...
FUSE is very cool - there are many useful things that can be done with
it. Kudos to Miklos and others for their work on it!
