this patchset does:
1 - drops gpio_set_high, gpio_set_low from the nsc_gpio_ops vtable.
While we can't drop them from scx200_gpio (or can we ?),  vtable users
(ie new users) dont need them, they can just use gpio_set()
2 - pure cosmetics - lose needless newlines.
3 - rename EXPORTed  gpio vtables  from {scx200,pc8736x}_access to  
_gpio_ops
new name is much closer to the vtable-name struct nsc_gpio_ops, and 
should be clearer.
Also rename the _fops vtable vars to _fileops to better disambiguate it 
from the gpio vtables.
