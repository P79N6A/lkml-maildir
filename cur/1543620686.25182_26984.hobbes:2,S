GRUB package should have provided /sbin/installkernel script to take
care of this properly - or some other package should have.
(In debian it's in debianutils).
Anyway - you can always provide this script yourself. Makefile gives it
four arguments: version, path to zImage, path to System.map, intall-direcotry
(the install directory is whatever is defined in kernel Makefile and if you
are not using the default (/), you can override it here)
