On a large machine: 856,432.

The current scheme will run out of processes, kernel stacks, etc before a
message scheme would.

Exactly the same as at present, with /sbin/hotplug chopped off.  So you can
run the daemon:
	while read x
	do
		/sbin/hotplug $x
	done < /dev/hotplug_event_pipe
for compatibility with existing scripts.
But I'm not really very opinionated about it.  I don't expect any of it to be
super-robust, really.
