Great. I will wait for couple of days for comments and then send them
your way.

I totally understand your concern.
CKRM's design is not tied with a specific implementation of a
controller. It allows hooking up different controllers for the same
resource. If a controller is considered complex, it can cut some of the
features and be made simpler. Or a simpler controller can replace an
earlier complex controller without affecting the user interface. 
This flexibility feature reduces the "cant-go-forward, cant-go-back"
problem, somewhat.
FYI, we found out that managing network resources was not falling into
this task based model and we had to invent complex layering to
accommodate it. So, we dropped our plans for network support. 
One can write controller for any resource that can be accounted at task
level. The corresponding subsystem stakeholders can ensure that it is
clean, and at acceptable level.

You might have seen the CPU controller (different implementation than
what we had earlier) and the numtasks controller (can prevent fork
bombs) that followed this patchset.

Our main object is to provide resource control for the hardware
resources: CPU, I/O and memory.
We have already posted the CPU controller.
We have two implementations of memory controller and a I/O controller. 
Memory controller is understandably more complex and controversial, and
that is the reason we haven't posted it this time around (we are looking
at ways to simplify the design and hence the complexity). Both the
memory controllers has been posted to linux-mm.
I/O controller is based on CFQ-scheduler.
> b) what they need to do
Both memory controllers provide control for LRU lists.
 - One maintains the active/inactive lists per class for each zone. It
   is of order O(1). Current code is little complex. We are looking at
   ways to simplify it.
 - Another creates pseudo zones under each zones (by splitting the 
   number of pages available in a zone) and attaches them with
   each class.
I/O Controller that we are working on is based on CFQ scheduler and
provides bandwidth control.

Both the memory controllers are fully functional. We need to trim them
down.
active/inactive list per class memory controller:

pzone based memory controller:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ckrm-tech&m=113867467006531&w=2
i/o controller: This controller is not ported to the framework posted,
but can be taken for a prototype version. New version would be simpler
though.
