You'll need at least 330 million tasks to run out.
At a minimum kernel memory allocation of about 8 kB per
task, that's about 2600 GB of kernel data structures.
I'm not sure we'll hit that limit, ever. Not because
we won't have a TB of kernel data space at some point
in the future, but because 330 million tasks is a lot
more than we'd want to manage with just a few CPUs ;)
kind regards,
Rik
