Hi all,
I'm glad to release the first MPU and NO-MMU support patch for ARM linux
2.6.10 at :
http://opensrc.sec.samsung.com/download/linux-2.6.10-hsc0.patch.gz
Previously, it was released as "armnommu" architecture which was called
uClinux/ARM and now is merged with "arm" architecture. You can select the
memory management type "MMU" for linux and "MPU" / "NONE" for uClinux at the
kernel configuration menu. Currently, the ATMEL, S5C7375, S3C24A0 platform
is tested.
I'm working on 2.6.11.5 patch, and it will be provided soon.
It would be great if you give me some suggestions.
Best Regards,
Hyok
