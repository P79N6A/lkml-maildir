But given that HA is the argument, you obviously failed.

There are two basic strategies (and you want both, of course):
1. Make sure hardware and software is stable.
2. Make sure hardware and software is redundant.
We're currently discussing 2. None of these two can be replaced by  
anything else.

Maybe I would, given hard disks are one of the system components I've seen  
fail more often. Then again, maybe I would not, given how often I've seen  
people behave rather idiotically.

Yes, but it will have ceased to be anything but an annoyance.

You suspect wrongly.

But you tried to argue that HA needs it. It doesn't.

No, I'm arguing against a specific argument, namely that it's something  
you need for HA. Which is just plain wrong.

I don't think this was ever in doubt.
