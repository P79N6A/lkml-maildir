What is the API that a user space apps will use to control the state of
VGA devices?
For example:
1) a standard device exposing IOCTLs needing an header file describing
it.
or 2) Building a new tree in /sys/class/vga that uses attributes to
control the state. you turn the device on by copying a '1' to the
attribute.
Once we pick sysfs or ioctl API, what should the full set of calls look
like?
