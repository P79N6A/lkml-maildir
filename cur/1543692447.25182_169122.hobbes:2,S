The above seems to just work around a sparse bug. Please don't - I'd 
rather have regular code and try to fix the sparse problem.
Hmm.. I wonder why sparse doesn't get the address space right on arrays. 
It should see that "d2" is a user pointer , so d2->d_name is one too.
It gets it right if you add the "+0", or if you add a "&" in front. So 
it looks like the sparse array->pointer degeneration misses something.
