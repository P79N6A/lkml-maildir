Synthesising an UP event after receiving a DOWN from the keyboard, and
nothing else for that key for > (repeat delay + a bit more) time looks
like a good plan to me, UNLESS there are keys which do report UP when
the key is released (as opposed to immediately after the DOWN), and
also don't repeat.
Unrelated: I have some messages from my laptop, Toshiba Satellite 4070CDT:
  atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x94, in isa0060/serio0) pressed.
  atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0xbf, in isa0060/serio0) pressed.
  atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0xa1, in isa0060/serio0) pressed.
Enjoy,
