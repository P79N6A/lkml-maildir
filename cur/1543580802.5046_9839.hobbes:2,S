Linux Kernel,
Version 1.1-5 of the Dolphin PCI-SCI (Scalable Coherent Interface) drivers
for Linux kernels 2.2.X and 2.4.X have been posted at 
vger.timpanogas.org:/sci.  These drivers are freely 
available under the GNU public License and are provided in both 
RPM and tar.gz format.  
NOTES:
These release enables some optimizations for the PSB66 66Mhz Adapters 
in the /sbin/PSB66/scitools utilities.  Additionally, the Adapter 
configuration utilities and diagnostics are now organized under 
/opt/DIS/sbin/{ PSB32, PSB64, PSB66 } depending on which adapter 
is installed in your system.  
Please direct any comments, questions, or bug reports to 
jmerkey@timpanogas.org or linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org relative 
to these drivers.
Jeff Merkey
Chief Engineer, TRG
