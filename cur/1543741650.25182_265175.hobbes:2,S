It wasn't an optimal solution, but just a quick hack that made the 
scrollpoint usable. BTW, I've tried with about a dozen wheelmice and all 
of them needed real misuse to get a packet where the scroll amount was 
more than 1....
Not that I'm claiming that those kind of mice don't exist. They do, one 
of them is this ScrollPoint that I'm using now.

That would be the right solution - I thought about it but deciced not to 
steal any more of my employers time.... Besides, I needed to slow the 
wheel/stick action down anyway since a light touch of the stick 
generates insane scroll events. In Windows with the default driver the 
stick operated like Home/End...
