Hi,
I'm using a new slab cache in some kernel functions I've changed.
These changes are only visible on the i386 arch.
So my question is: where to put the code that initializes my cache when 
booting the kernel? I don't think that init/main.c is the preferred place 
to put arch-dependent init stuff...
Frank.
