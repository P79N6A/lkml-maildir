Hi 
I know this is not really liked, but since I dont have a lot of money,
and this is the only "good" video card I have.
Have anyone made a successful run of X with nvidia (closes source)
module ??, I have a TNT2 running on a 2.4.20-gentoo-r7 kernel, but when
I try to run X on 2.4.22* or 2.6.0* I alway get an error about my screen
and /dev/nvidia0.
Is there any work on this ??, please dont tell me to change my video
card, because I cant.
Thanks in advance
Max
