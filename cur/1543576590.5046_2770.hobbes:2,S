yes, mount devices several times it would be a nice feature, but do
something like:
/etc/fstab:
/dev/hdd1 /mydrive ext2 ro,noauto,user 1 1
as user: mount /mydrive
as root: mount /dev/hda2 /mydrive
as user: mount /mydrive
as root: mount /dev/hda2 /mydrive
as user: mount /mydrive
result /proc/mounts:
/dev/hdd1 /mydrive ext2 ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
/dev/hda2 /mydrive vfat rw 0 0
/dev/hdd1 /mydrive ext2 ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
/dev/hda2 /mydrive vfat rw 0 0
/dev/hdd1 /mydrive ext2 ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0     
u dont have control about the mountpoints
Here a BIG PROBLEM:
as user: mount /mydrive
as root: mount /dev/hdd1 /test
as root: mount /dev/hdd1 /mnt
result /proc/mounts:
/dev/hdd1 /mydrive ext2 ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
/dev/hdd1 /test ext2 ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
/dev/hdd1 /mnt ext2 ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0    
but do like 
mount -o remount /mnt -w
result /proc/mounts:
/dev/hdd1 /mydrive ext2 rw 0 0
/dev/hdd1 /test ext2 rw 0 0
/dev/hdd1 /mnt ext2 rw 0 0     
ALL mountpoints now READ-WRITE-able!
u lost noexec... and dont have more "security" for users...
same as sym-links ... no new feature...
