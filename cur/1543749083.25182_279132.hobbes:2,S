That seems quite an hack, note I did an hack too and it make the drift
much smaller (it gets manageable). But our modifications are wrong.
The point is that this didn't happen with HZ=100, so it's not that
tickadj is wrong, it's the tick adjustment code that doesn't work.
You may want to recompile your kernel with HZ=100 and verify it goes
away (I didn't verify myself, but I verified the max irq latency I get
is 4msec, and in turn I'm sure HZ=100 would fix it)
