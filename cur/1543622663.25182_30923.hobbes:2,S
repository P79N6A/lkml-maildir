Help! Using 2.4.18 (and verified as far back as .9) - I am getting a process freeze when an application does an fsync. I thought turning off HIGHMEM solved the issue, but I am now getting an identical freeze on an msync. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Please CC to nkirsch@insynq.com. 
Thanks!
Nick
