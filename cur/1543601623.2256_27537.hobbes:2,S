The reverse mapping issue is not do we have a way to find where in the page
tables a page is mapped.  But if we keep track of it in a data structure
that allows us to do so extremely quickly.  The worst case for our current
data structures to unmap one page is O(page mappings).
For distributed filesystems contention sucks.  No matter how you play it
contention for file data will never be a fast case.  Not if you have
very many people contending for the data.  So this isn't a fast case.
Additionally our current data structures are optimized for unmapping
page ranges.  Since if your contention case is sane you will be
grabbing more than 4k at a time our looping through the vm_areas of
a mapping should be more efficient than doing that loop once for
each page that needs to be unmapped.
