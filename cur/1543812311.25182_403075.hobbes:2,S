Ouch!
It turns out that smp_core99_give/take_timebase are using a 32-bit
variable to transfer the timebase value from one cpu to the other.  So
the bottom 32 bits end up synchronized but the top 32 bits are quite
different, hence the different time of day on the two cpus.
The fix is to change `timebase' to be a u64.  I have that change
queued up in my powerpc-merge tree, which I'll ask Linus to pull
shortly.
Paul.
