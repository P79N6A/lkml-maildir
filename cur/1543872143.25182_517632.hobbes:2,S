I haven't even seriously tried. I don't yet have a laptop and I like
staying logged.  The first time I rolled the jiffie counter it was a
happened after I had realized that if I kept my machine up for another
couple of months my jiffie counter would roll and I said why not  So
basically suspend hasn't been a feature I'm been interested in using.
I get more annoyed at my UPS failing..
I will probably get around to figuring out the whole suspend/resume
thing one of these days and it will probably take me a day or two.
But that doesn't result in bug fixes being delivered in a timely manner.
