And templates, and operator overloading etc etc.
C++ is much harder to maintain because there are a zillion obscure
features people can use in there. It means that the people who
maintains the kernel needs to understand these things as well thus we
suddenly reduce the number of potential kernel programmers to a tiny
fraction of what we had before.
