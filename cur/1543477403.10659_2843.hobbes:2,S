Sorry mate [1], but this is one for the RAID people. It would appear that the 
md driver some how failed to lock down the underlying SCSI driver. When a SCSI 
disk is mounted (natively) the mid-level driver forces a module count increase, 
and also a module count decrease when unmounted.
What you observed should only occur if the usage count for the ppa driver is 
zero. How that occured I am not sure...

I still have to chase down an OOPS related to the ppa driver when a machine ran 
out of virtual memory. The info I have is very sketchy relating to that report 
since it appears the mid-level scsi driver failed to allocate some memory and 
the ppa driver went feral (the ppa driver does not use kmalloc).
