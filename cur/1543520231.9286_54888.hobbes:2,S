All,
I'm trying to implement an idle loop in some code (lower tty driver). In
actual fact, I'm trying to implement locking. In a nutshell, if I see the
lock flag has been set, I want to sit and wait until it becomes unset.
Trouble is, when I try to use schedule() I get a panic. Of course, when I
comment out the schedule() the machine hangs because the loop is now busy.
Is there any support for critical sections in this sort of driver. Spinlocks
don't seem to be working in this instance.
Any takers?
