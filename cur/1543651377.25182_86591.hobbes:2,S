Well, it turns out that the reason I couldn't boot was a conflict 
between the boot time checks and devfs (with devfs on /dev/hdb9 didn't 
exist...).  If I turned off devfs loading at boot everything went okay.
However, there *were* those problems that fsck.ext3 found and I'm still 
kind of suspicious about them.
