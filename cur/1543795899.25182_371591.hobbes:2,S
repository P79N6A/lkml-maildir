Ethan confirmed that it's 1095:3114.  Arghhh....  Maybe we should keep 
m15w quirk for 3114's for the time being?  Better be slow than hang. 
Whatever bug the m15w quirk was hiding.
Carlos, can you double check that 3114's don't have the m15w issue?  It 
just seems too similar to the usual m15w lockup.
