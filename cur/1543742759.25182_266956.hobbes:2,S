I'll non-micro-benchmark stuff for you on big machines if you want, but I've 
wasted enough time coding this stuff already ;-)
BTW, the one really useful thing the whole page zeroing stuff did was to
shift the profiled cost of page zeroing out to the routine acutally using
the pages, as it's no longer just do_anonymous_page taking the cache hit.
