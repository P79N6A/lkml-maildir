Hi,
I just upgraded the BIOS on my Dell L400 laptop from rev A01 to A03. Now the cs4281 module refuses to load. I used to load perfectly.
Nov 29 13:19:40 devil kernel: cs4281: version v1.13.32 time 17:15:07 Nov 28 2001
Nov 29 13:19:40 devil kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:08.0
Nov 29 13:19:41 devil kernel: cs4281: DLLRDY failed!
Nov 29 13:19:41 devil kernel: cs4281: cs4281_hw_init() failed. Skipping part.
Nov 29 13:19:41 devil kernel: cs4281: probe()- no device allocated
Any suggestions as to how to track down the offending changes?
/Anders
