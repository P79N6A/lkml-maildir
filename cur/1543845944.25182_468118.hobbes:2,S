This description implies that the patch implements something for i386

but all it does is delete stuff.
I _assume_ that it switches i386 over to using the (undescribed) generic
core, and it does that merely by implementing read_persistent_clock().
But I'd have expected to see some Kconfig change in there as well?
Does this implementation support all forms of persistent clock which are
known to exist on i386 platforms?
If/when you issue new changelogs, please describe what has to be done to
port other architectures over to use this overall framework.
Do ports for other architectures exist?
