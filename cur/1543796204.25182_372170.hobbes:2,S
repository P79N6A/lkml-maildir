The point is that you could switch both the timer and timeout  
implementations to jiffies if you wanted to, at the expense of the  
accuracy that a lot of people care about.

This is _exactly_ why there is the timer/timeout distinction.  Some  
things don't care, and as a result use a timer wheel exactly like  
they always have.  For the things that do, however, the new timer API  
provides it using the fastest hardware interface available.
