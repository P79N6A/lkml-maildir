Yes - Two of them and there is a known issue with certain PS output. I did
not see the earlier messages about the problem but I will briefly relate
what I know:
Lexmark Optra R/R+ Original Firmware had a PS Level 2 bug that was
consistantly tripped by StarOffice and Netscape PS output from Linux but
not from Netscape PS on Windorks. I got an updated firmware and the
problem went away.
Lexmark SC1275N has the newer PS Level 2 code from Lexmark and works fine
- BTW that was how I "Proved" to Lexmark Tech Support that I had a problem
because the sam file printed on the 1275 but not on the Optra R.

If I am not addressing the original issue - I apologize for wasting the
bandwidth.
