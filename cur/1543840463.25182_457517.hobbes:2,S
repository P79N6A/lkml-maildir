Yes, I agree -- although I haven't tested for performance yet; there
_may_ be something surprisingly improved in there but I suspect it's
unlikely.

OLPC has USB ports and wants to be fairly flexible about being able to
connect stuff -- I don't think we can turn off CONFIG_MODULES in its
running kernel. However, its _boot_ kernel (LinuxBIOS) has
CONFIG_MODULES=n, and that's where we _really_ care about the space.
