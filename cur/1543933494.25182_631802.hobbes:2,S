How about delaying the CPU_UP_CANCELED_FROZEN announcements until it's 
really safe to send them out?  That is, after all devices have been 
resumed and the PM core no longer holds any of their locks.  (Should 
this be before or after tasks leave the freezer? -- I'm not sure.)
So the idea is send appropriate announcements at the usual time for
CPUs that do come back up normally, and don't send anything right away
for CPUs that fail to come up.  Just keep track of which ones failed,
and then later take care of them.
