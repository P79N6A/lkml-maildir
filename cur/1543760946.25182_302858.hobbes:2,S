Sorry, the incremental patch looks like this

The conversion
  limit_value = 19 - limit_value;
takes place in can_nice() in kernel/schec.c and had to be removed.

Sound good.
I've tested with both 2.6.11-mm3 and 2.6.11-bk10 + patch above.
jackd starts OK with realtime scheduling and playing with nice seems OK
when I have positive values for "rt_priority" and "nice" in limits.conf.
