    The ext3 thing is a bug, the case for which I don't think has been
adequately explained to the ext[34] folks.  There should be at least a
no_replay mount flag available, or something.  It has ramifications
for more than just hibernation.
    And yeah, I'm gonna bring up the swap files thing again.  If you
can hibernate to a swap file, you can hibernate to a dedicated
hibernation file, and vice versa.
    If you can't hibernate to a swap file, then swap files are
effectively unsupported for any system you might want to hibernate.
<handwave> I wonder what embedded folks would think about that
</handwave>.
    But, in my ignorance, I'm not sure even fixing the ext3 bug will
guarantee you consistent metadata so that you can handle a
swap/hibernate file.  You can do a sync(), but how do you make that
not race against running processes without the freezer, or blkdev
snapshots?
    I guess uswsusp and the-patch-previously-known-as-suspend2 handle
this somehow, though.
   (It's that same ignorance that has me waiting for someone with
established credit with kernel people to make that argument for the
ext3 bug, so I can hang my own reasons for thinking that it's bad off
of theirs).
