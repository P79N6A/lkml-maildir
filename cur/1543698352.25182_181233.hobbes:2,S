Some IDE _and/or_ SCSI drives do not cache writes.  For these drives,
the _absence_ of an OS flush-cache command still means your data gets
to the platter.
The core problem is not issuing a flush-cache command, it sounds like.
The drive technology (wcache, or no) is largely irrelevant.

eh?  flush-cache very definitely hurts performance, on both IDE and
SCSI, for drives that support write caching.

As well he should be :)
