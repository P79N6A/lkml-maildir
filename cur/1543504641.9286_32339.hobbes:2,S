Sounds like you mean just after boot on a small memory system.
What I used to do was force everything out just after boot and let the
kernel page it back in:
dd bs=32768k count=1 if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null
but that's been optimised away now, now you have to use:
cat /dev/zero | dd ibs=1k count=32768 obs=32768k of=/dev/null
The 32768 is the size of your memory ... be very sure you have enough
swap!
