Hi Linus,
	nfs is broken in 2.5 ATM because it does set_bit on an "int".
Can be *please* just bite the bullet and change the prototype on these
ops so we stop seeing the same mistakes over and over?
This and "copy_from_user doesn't return -EFAULT" are the two classic
trivial kernel bugs.
Thanks,
Rusty.
