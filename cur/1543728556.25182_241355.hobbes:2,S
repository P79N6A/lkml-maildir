Incremental atop the mm reference patch:
out_of_memory() attempts to determine whether one jiffies-valued
variable refers to a point in time preceding another jiffies-valued
variable, but does not do so in a jiffies wrap -safe fashion. The
following patch corrects this by using the expansion of the 2.6
macro time_after() to check this condition.
