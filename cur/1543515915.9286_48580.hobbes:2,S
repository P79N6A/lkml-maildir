	Considering only signals which a process can catch and process.
	(E.g. not about KILL or STOP or CONT ...)
	*ANY* classical signal in *ANY* UNIX is "unrealiable". You will
	get them, unless given signal is already in execution in which
	case no more of same signal are sent while that execution lasts..
	Once previous signal S processing has completed, same process can
	receive again a signal S.
	That is, you will get SIGURG, but you will not get guaranteed
	info that there was only one SIGURG coming to your way.
	(There may have been dozens during that processing.)

	"URG" -- It relates to IO events - some platforms call it SIGPOLL.
	It does not carry supplementary data, e.g. "who" (which fd) caused
	this event.
	There are then things called Queued Signals, which (to certain
	extent) will guarantee delivery of the signal in question even
	while same signal is already blocking -- the queue is not of
	infinite length..  They can also deliver supplementary data.
	At this list there has been recent talk about how to poll
	16000 fd's at single process - effectively.
