Why not a TRACE_VFS or TRACE_SYSCALL and then multiplex there open,
close, etc? trace_assign_type will get humongous in no time this way.
TRACE_BLK does multiplexing, as does TRACE_PROCESS that Frank just
posted too, and I'm working on a plugin for the patch that Neil
submitted for the socket layer that also will need an entry there for
its tracepoints.
Frederic, it seems that discussion about subtypes has to continue :-)
