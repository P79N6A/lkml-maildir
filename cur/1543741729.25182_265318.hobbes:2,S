Debugging in acpi_bus_register_driver():
printk("name=%s node=%p acpi_bus_drivers.prev=%p\n", driver->name, &driver->node, acpi_bus_drivers.prev);

No, it seems that the floppy code is registering fine (it gets return of 1 
from acpi_bus_register_driver()).

It's not.
Given that this is disappearing when enabling debug info, perhaps it's a 
compilation or similarly obsucure bug.
