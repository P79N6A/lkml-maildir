Why? It is a backing cache. The only case where serialisation ought to
bother you is the case where the client has to invalidate the cache due
to a server-side update of the file.

Once the RPC calls have been launched, the process returns to the VM
layer and just waits for the next page to be unlocked. It never returns
to the filesystem layer. So where are you using the process context to
write out the cached data?

The cookie lookups need to be synchronous, but why would the file
creation need to be synchronous? Creating the cachefs file and waiting
on that to complete etc are all utterly useless activities as far as
satisfying the user request for data goes. Just start the process of
creating a backing file, and then get on with the actual syscall.

Agreed.
