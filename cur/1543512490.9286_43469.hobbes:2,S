    The indented setup for this use is mostly for CDROMs shared by samba
servers to DOS/Windows clients.  In this setup DOS/Windows easily handle
disappearing cwd as those OS's generally expect that CD's may be ejected.
And under Linux I know that at least bash deals with a lost cwd well.  And
thats the main one that I'd be concerned about under Linux.  In the current
setup one running shell, probably just left minimized somewhere or on a
forgotten login that happened to have its cwd somewhere under /cdrom creates
the administrative headache of having to track the offending process(es)
down and correct the situation.  Nowhere near userfriendly and creates extra
administrative work.
