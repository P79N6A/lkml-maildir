The dependency here is a bit vague in the first place. For UP NUMA the
asm-generic definitions are perfectly fine, it's only the CONFIG_NUMA &&
CONFIG_SMP cases where there is any point in doing anything more
fine-grained. So while it would be trivial to add a CONFIG_SMP test here
too, that's likely to break all of the other NUMA platforms.
So while sh can use the asm-generic definitions in the UP case, it
obviously can't on SMP. The easiest option for now is to just stub the
asm-generic bits in to asm-sh/topology.h under a CONFIG_NUMA ifdef and
then add more reasonable definitions for the SMP cases.
