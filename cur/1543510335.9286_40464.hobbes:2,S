Hi,
Instead of arguing wether proc-fs should be mandatory better
try to unify /proc and sysctl from the kernel side of view so
that /proc is really just the "human readable" part for which
also the machine readable part is accessable via sysctl.
This could clean up userland tools, too.
Of course one should split the real proc part out of /proc
away to a pidfs or the like. (mapping pidfs to sysctl seems
hard)
Richard.
