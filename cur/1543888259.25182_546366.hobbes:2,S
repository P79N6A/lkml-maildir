The # is a comment character. So those lines are not used.
BTW: the @ means group, you really want that? BTW2: you need to log out/in
and the session leader must actually be PAM regulated (i.e. not for daemons)
So it is good to check "ulimit -n" in the shell where you want to try the
forbomb. If it is below 100 you should be safe.
