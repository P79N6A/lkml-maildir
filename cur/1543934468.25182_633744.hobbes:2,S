Theirs works rather differently - the GO bit is there, but there's 
another append register which is used to tell the controller that a new 
tag has been added to the CPB list.
The only thing we currently use the GO bit for is to switch between ADMA 
and port register mode. Could be there's something we need to do there, 
though, who knows..
