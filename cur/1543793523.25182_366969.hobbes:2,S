For simplicity, the only pids a process will see are those in its own
pidspace, and the only controls (I expect) will be the ability to start
a new pidspace, and request a pid.  So it is no more complicated than
the vserver model, where a process becomes pid 1 only for other proceses
in the same vserver, and process don't see processes in other vservers -
except that now every process in the pidspace can be known as a different
pid, not just the first.

Unfortunately that would not work for checkpoints across boots, or, more
importantly, for process (set) migration.

Hopefully the next patchset, implementing the pid-vpid split, will show
it's not as complicated as I've made it sound.
Of course, if it remains too complicated a conceptual change to be
mergeable, we're better off knowing that now...
