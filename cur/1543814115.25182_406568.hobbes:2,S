agree, the process that creates a pidspace is in different pidspaces if you
want to maintain the process hierarchy.

yes.

I don't know yet if we would use it but we need it :) One way of the other.
The creator of a pidspace could be the parent of multiple pidspaces and
hence it needs multiples pids, one in each pidspace.
Could that be done with the syscall creating the pidspace ? because it
seems that the process creating a pidspace is the only candidate ?

OK good. That's what we need to begin with : something cheap to prove the
feature is useful.
We have already implemented the vpid in a very similar way to the openvz
team, although with less optimization and linux feeling. Both efforts and
yours, on pidspaces, didn't prove to be good enough to be valuable.
