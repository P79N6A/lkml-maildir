Here is a purely hypothethical (and in practice unlikely) idea:
Java opens up too many sockets (more than you really request) and the
kernel, for whatever reason, does not deliver packets to programs
which have maxed out their fds. Well it would already help if the
java blob was split into multiple blobs (assuming the problem
persists), as the best testcase is the smallest possible one. So if
it is reproducable without the web blob, great step there.
