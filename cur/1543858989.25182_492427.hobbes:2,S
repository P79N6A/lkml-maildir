Hello Andrew,
Thank you for your reply and advice.
I'll send the revised patchset after I fix what you pointed out.

OK, I'll put a bit field right next to `dumpable' member and add a global
lock to protect them from the race.
I have the perception that only writing to these bit-fields needs to
acquire a lock. Simultaneous writes to both bit-fields can cause either one
to be overwritten with its old value. But simultaneous read and write
from/to separate bit-fields is safe because write to one bit-field
doesn't affect read from the other.
The dumpable can be modified at following timing:
  - before starting core dumping in do_coredump()
  - when initialize mm_struct in flush_old_exec()
  - when *uid or *gid is changed by the coresponding system call
  - when the dumpable is modified directly by prctl(2)
I expect that these don't occur so much frequently, so I consider that
the performance impact by using a global lock is small.

Currently, binfmt_aout.c and binfmt_elf_fdpic.c have their own core dump
routines as well as binfmt_elf.c.  However, as far as I know,
binfmt_aout.c never dumps shared memory. 
So I will convert only binfmt_elf_fdpic.c to support this feature.

I think we can avoid it by providing a sysctl parameter which
disables/enables this feature.
Another idea is that we provide a sysctl parameter to prohibit non-root
user from writing to /proc/<pid>/coremask. If the administrator want to 
force a full coredump on a bad process, he/she only has to clear the
coremask after setting the sysctl parameter.
For now, I will implement the first idea, because its design and
implementation are simple and it is easy to use.
