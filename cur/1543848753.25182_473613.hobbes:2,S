Subject: [PATCH 004 of 5] knfsd: Fix bug in recent lockd patches that can cause reclaim to fail.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/16/333

When an nfs server shuts down, lockd needs to release all the locks
even though the client still holds them.
It should therefore not 'unmonitor' the clients, so that the files in
nfs/sm will still be there when the nfs server restarts, so that those
clients will be told to reclaim their locks.
However the hosts are fully unmonitored, so statd may well remove the
files.
lockd has a test for 'sm_sticky' and avoid the unmonitor call if it is
set, but it is currently not set.
So set it when tearing down lockd.
