I guess the good way to think of some of this is not as broken files.
But rather in the plan9 model.  Initially everything on the machine is
owned by one user (in our case root).  That user then controls who
else gets access to files by calling chown etc.
If you want access to those files in a different uid namespace someone
needs to call chown or at least chmod on them, and I'm not
at all certain this as a problem is limited to special files on
a filesystem.
Really when you do a proper user namespace this all comes for free.

I completely agree we need a capability like that.  I disagree on the
implementation because it is not general.  What we have really hit is
the classic uid mapping problem that shows up occasionally with
network filesystems.  That is the problem we need to solve.
I'm pretty certain the current kernel key infrastructure gives us the
infrastructure we need to do that in a general way.  At which point
it would be a policy decision which uid to map to which other uid
and we could easily match the current
