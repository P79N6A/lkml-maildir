This now has clean taskfile io tested on two archs.
Both PowerMac UP and x86 all appear stable with taskfile io enabled.
PPC well generate a random missed interrupt in mult-mode pio on a sync
call but it never misses a beat or hangs.
Feed back from a few people have stated Sparc ?? amnd PPC64 appear stable.
IA-64 is the only know broken arch.  Since returning the heater^WItanic^box 
testing various hardware there is not practical.
Cheers and Complain if it does not work.
