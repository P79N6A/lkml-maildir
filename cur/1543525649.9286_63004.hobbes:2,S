(off-list)
Some bug reports to linux-kernel, and my own experience testing 8139too,
seem to say otherwise...
I got _constant_ timeouts on UP until I updated the 8139too interrupt
handler from
	if (tx buffer not full) {
		tx_full=0;
		netif_wake_queue(dev);
	}
to
	if (tx buffer not full) {
		tx_full = 0;
	}
	if (tx_full)
		netif_wake_queue(dev);
	else
		netif_stop_queue(dev);
Regards,
	Jeff
