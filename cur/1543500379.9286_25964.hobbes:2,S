I was under the impression that they used some hack to mmap a kernel 
ring buffer via a character device. Someone is implementing that on Linux
too, although I tried to talk them out of it (and put their time into a better
libpcap instead). Their code will run in the IRQ at the end and probably
be rather similar to turbopacket.

And lots of time writing data to disk + a complex multi process setup.
Some gaps inbetween where there are wasted cycles in waiting wouldn't
be that surprising. The multithread model also has the advantage that
it keeps the kernel packet queues short (ok, I could increase the rcvbuf
to a very huge value, but I would prefer to do that in a user space ring
buffer)
