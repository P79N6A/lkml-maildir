In your code channel corresponds to an index in the ports array of the
host adapter and hence is known before you do any logical unit scanning.
Id is assigned from a bitmap in the port.  You could do that assignment
in sas_discover_end_dev() then you could use scsi_scan_target() in place
of sas_do_lu_discovery().  It would also mitigate your bug below since
now your id is one to one on the end devices rather than the logical
units of the end devices, so each port would support up to 128 end
devices rather than 128 logical units.
