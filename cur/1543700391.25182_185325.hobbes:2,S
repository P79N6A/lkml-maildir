Oh I tried gnomemeeting, the Xserver and the kernel compile at different
nice levels without significant changes. Additionally I don't have any
problems with audio playback under load, it's just that gnomemeeting is
performing worse than in 2.4.2x.

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
