Ask Cox, not me :-) Since Cox is RedHat's employee it looks VERY weird to me
that RedHat's kernel and "official" Cox's kernel are two such different beasts.
Anyway, as 2.2.15 turned out to be "quick bugfix release" (AGAIN!) RAID 0.90
will not be integrated. If it'll be integrated in 2.2.x series at all...

They should wait for Ingo to release RAID 0.90 patch for 2.2.15 I think :-)
At least knfsd (not know about RAID) was sheduled for inclusion in 2.2.15 but
now when 2.2.15 is "quick bug-fix release" (AGAIN!) it looks like KNFSD and
RAID will be postponed once again :-/

They can expect it to work. And it even works. Sometimes.

Looks like you just asked in wrong place :-) It's typical situation in fact:
there are LOTS of patches floating around. But they will be added in kernel
only when they looks "good enough". Sometimes conclusion is that "it's good
stuff and it should be added... in next version of kernel - since there are to
many changes to make such a pile of changes suitable for inclusion in stable
kernel". Even if for most peoples RAID 0.90 works MUCH better then default
RAID from stock linux kernel.

Not at all. It was more like "RAID 0.90 looks great but it's not yet clear if
improvements are really big enough to add incompatibilities in stable kernel
series". Only when it's clear that applaying patch is  "Good Thing(tm)" patch
is applied. All other patches (and there are LOTS of them: RAID patches, KNFSD
patches, IDE patches, etc) should be VERY rigourously tested before they will
be included in linux kernel. ESPECIALLY in stable version. As Linus said
"I prefer to have a known bug that will eventually get fixed than an ugly
solution that will hide it forever." I hope you'll undertood this position.
If you call this "hobbyist/geek system" - be so, swicth to other system.

Unfortunatelly "quality" means different things for different peoples :-/

It WAS documented. In linux-kernel mailing list archives. Unfortunatelly it's
THE ONLY more or less complete documentation for kernel :-/ Even here some
things are not documented but all other sources are even less complete.
AI> Still disappointed, but grateful for the help!
