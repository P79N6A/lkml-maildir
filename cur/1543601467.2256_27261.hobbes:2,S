This was a dumb patch. It didn't schedule so the USB kernel thread
could not do anything. This is fixed in the patch below. The ip=wait
parameter is gone now: it'll always wait for a net device if you're
doing nfsroot.
I've tested it with a Pegasus USB ethernet adapter and it works ok.
You can even boot the kernel without any adapter plugged in. It will
patiently wait for you to plug one in. Then it'll start the
dhcp/bootp/rarp stuff.
