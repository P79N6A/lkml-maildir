The big one for some of it is modularity. Linux is very modular and its 
important it stays that way - thats why my tree can often differ from Linus
by 1Mb and I can throw in Linus 2.3.3x pre patches with no clashes and no
changes needed to fix up afterwards.
That makes for maintainability and debuggability.
