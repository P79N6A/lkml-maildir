Don't change topics. that is what overcommit in this case is. It can
crash systems BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WAS TOLD TO ALLOCATE MORE MEMORY THAN WAS
AVAILABLE.

Besides doing so anyway... Any overcommited resource causes system problems,
some more than others.

No - that is a fault of management authorizing overcommitting resources.
This is the same problem linux has, but without the management authorization.

User mode problems can allways cause the system to crash, if resources are
overcommited (memory in particular) - either directly due to the system going
into a deadlock hang, or directly, by having init fail.

Under UNICOS - yes.
Under IRIX - no, managemnt has directed that overcommitting memory resources
to be permitted.
Under Linux - no, no choice.

The courses never covered the larger systems, unfortunately. I walked into
the "advanced system administration" and asked a simple question: "How do I
add 1500 user accounts using IRIX user administration tools?" After a
2-3 minute pause the answer "Not that way".

yes - now if irix would fully implement the API to get to the kerne to set
the limits... (they are there, but not available for batch systems to use -
it has to be done via systune, which is not exactly dynamic).

Not yet. Resource limits would allow such in a Beowulf cluster though. They
seem to look more like IBM SP systems ( I haven't yet used either, our SP
doesn't arrive until sometime this summer).

Several of your users submit large jobs, they just run serially instead of
in parallel.

I think the crash simply recorded "init terminated". No bus serror,
no error messages, just a reboot.
Unfortunately, the structure SGI uses to start these processes doesn't
allow init to restart them. The "official" restart is to reboot, or
reinitialize the network. To get that to work reliably (it usually works
to just "/etc/init.d/network start" but some daemons (RPC ones?) don't
always get the message. Then the only way to fix it is to "network stop;
"network start". IRIX really has some bugs in init too - a "telinit q"
or kill -1 "init pid" doesn't always re-read the config file correctly.
(same goes for inetd... which is worse since it is done more often).

It really wouldn't happen if we didn't overcommit memory. If sufficent
swap space (or at least more). The SGI analyst did get convenced to add
another 12 GB swap space, which reduced the failure rate to something more
acceptable.

It is covered by the definition - the process has been told the memory
is available and gave a pointer to it. Between the time the kernel gave
the resource and the time it used it, it may have been taken back.
One place this occurs is in application specific memory allocators - the
application may allocate a memory pool for it to use (see Lisp GC for an
example). The application (LISP) may not use it immediately, but does dole
it out as the users code requires. During LISP garbage collection aborts
because it cannot condense two chunks of memory because the second chunk
may not have been used yet. (depending on the size of the chunk of course).

I think it is. The kernel is out of resources because it granted user
processes access to more memory than the kernel could give.
