No, it's not a bug. It would be a bug if esd was writing to a *real* file
or if the write() returned -1 and an errno of EAGAIN. But incomplete writes
are very much ok.
Just try opening /dev/tty and see how it won't take writes of more than
2k (iirc). And that's not just on Linux, I've tested on Solaris and BSD
as well -- though it was a while ago.
