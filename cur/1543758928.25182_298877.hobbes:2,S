I hate to point out the obvious to someone of longer standing, but
according to the current system, since we increment integrally, 2.10.0
would be the successor release to the 2.9.X dev series, unless you know
something about a severe and profound internals shakeup scheduled for 2.9
that we don't.  :)
OT, 3.0.0 is an even-numbered release, therefore stable.  So what do you
call the odd-numbered unstable series that produces it?  ;)
