What we really want to give is exclusitivity verses other 'end users',
as opposed the 'filters'.
I'm defining an 'end user' to be a handler that cares about all the
events from a device and plans on doing something with it.
That would be the console layer for keyboards, /dev/input/mice and
/dev/input/mouse<n> for mice, X for both of those, etc.
A 'filter' cares about a key or two, and might even want to remove it
from the stream, rfkill is a good example.
Now, how do we design for that?  Not a clue right now, still thinking
about it really.
