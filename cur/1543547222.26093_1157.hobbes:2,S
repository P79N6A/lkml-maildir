When a process (traced using the ptrace call) forks, the tracing process
cannot keep track of the first few system calls executed by the child
process as the child may be scheduled to run before it can be safely
attached.
Is there any mechanism to automatically stop a process created
by a traced parent preventing this race condition from occurring ?
If not, what are the implications of adding this functionality to the
kernel via say a /proc interface ?
