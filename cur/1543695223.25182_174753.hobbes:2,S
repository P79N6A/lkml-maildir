Personally I like to put it in the same place as the kernel itself and the
System.map.  Then I tack the full version number on the end just like I do
with System.map.  Even for non-modular kernels it is frequently convenient
to have access to the .config so when you boot up a random isolinux CD you
know exactly what support you are going to have.
