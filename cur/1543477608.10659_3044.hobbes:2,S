  Hello.
 I've tracked down the bug in loop device. The problem was that when loop device created the block
in sparse file it didn't update real_block and so it was writing block to block 0 of the device
(I'm glad that SB is in block 1 ;-). This reminds me if it wouldn't be possible to add a check to
fsck whether has anybody written anything to block 0 and warn about that... The patch I did should
correct the bug (at least now loopback works for me).
					Honza.
PS: I wonder how this could ever work ;-)
