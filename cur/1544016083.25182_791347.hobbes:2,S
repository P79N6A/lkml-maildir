You don't even need that - just define the behaviour of oom_adj to
inherit.
Of course thats still often totally the wrong behaviour as you'll find out
when a key system service is started up by a client that wants to use it
that was run by some low privilege untrusted process with tight resource
limits.
For desktop Jim Gettys proposed a very simple and quite elegant use of
this sort of thing which was to let the window manager do some of the
work according to what hadn't been used for ages.
