Ok, in the bodies of those, put in
j1=c1;
j2=c2;
j3=c3;
With new definitions for j1, j2 and k3 as being volatile.  Accesses are volatile:
       [#2] Accessing  a  volatile  object,  modifying  an  object,
       modifying  a  file,  or  calling a function that does any of
       those operations are all side effects
So, I would claim that the case is symetric with writing volatiles.
If the standard doesn't make a distinction for write v read, then you
can't and claim that distinction is based in the standard.  If you
claim the standard does make a distinction, please point it out, I am
unaware of it.
