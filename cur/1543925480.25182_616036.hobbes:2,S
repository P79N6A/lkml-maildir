from prior discussions I understand that the problem is that it's not easy 
(or nessasarily possible) to figure out the path to the fd, so what do you 
check?
if the file has been removed there _is_ no path to the fd.
with hard links there could be many paths to the fd, the only way to find 
them would be to search the entire filesystem.
as a result App Armor has decided not to try and address this, but is 
documenting it as a limitation.
