Subject: [PATCH, v2] Input: tell mousedev to handle HP remote console virtual mouse using absolute coordinates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The HP Integrated Remote Console Virtual Mouse, which is standard equipment 
on all Proliant and Integrity servers, produces absolute coordinates 
instead of relative coordinates.  This is done to synchronize the 
position of the mouse cursor on the client desktop with the mouse 
cursor position on the server.  Mousedev is not designed to pass 
those absolute events directly to X, but it can translate them 
into relative movements.  It currently does this for tablet like devices 
and touchpads.  This patch tells mousedev to also enable this function for
the HP virtual mouse.  This patch is narrower in scope than my previous
patch of the same name, which enabled abs-to-rel translation for all 
devices with ABS_X, ABS_Y, and BTN_LEFT.
This patch enables the mouse pointer to move when using the remote
console.  Without this patch, the cursor will not move.
