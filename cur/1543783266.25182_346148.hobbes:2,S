just to make sure the original point gets across: the warning is only in 
the -rt tree, and it pinpoints potential SMP bugs. Does your box do 
hyperthreading? If yes then this could be a live (but probably mostly 
harmless) SMP bug. Maybe the whole IRQ disabling is unnecessary?  
__devinit is mostly serialized, so i'm not sure there's any protection 
needed against parallel IRQs?
