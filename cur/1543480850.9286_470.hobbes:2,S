AFAIK te boot loader stores some BIOS information (like the harddisk table)
in memory before switching to the protected mode. I guess NT is doing the
same thing. But you are right BIOS and VGA Bios Strings are 'nice to
have[tm]' sometimes.
Not sure about the bios32 extensions. There have been kernel patches to get
to the realmode bios.
