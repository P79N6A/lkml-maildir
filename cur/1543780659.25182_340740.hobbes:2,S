Ugly.  Wouldn't make a difference on i386, but other architectures
actually don't need to play function-guessing games.  Maybe we could
create an architecture-provided function like
void *get_next_stack_function(void* last_function);
For asm-generic, this would do the i386 style stack guessing, while
other architectures can walk a stack frame for it.
[ Yes, I realize that noone cares enough to actually do it, including
me, but it still would be nice. ]
