I've reinstalled the machine from scratch with RH6.1.  With the default
kernel, the 8139 works in 10Mb mode.  2.2.14 with the 8139 and eepro100
drivers built as modules works, too.  Same kernel, only change being those
two drivers static-linked, doesn't work.  I have no idea how to go about
debugging this, so if anyone has advice, I'm listening :)
I can't get a working 2.3.4[01] at all at the moment -- the kernel
panics at boot time.  I assume I've done something stupid.  I haven't
tried 100Mb at all yet because my only 100Mb switch is at home.

Thanks for this.  I'll give it a go.
James.
