Tho I'm starting to feel like I've touched off some religion in

well, one man's "clean" is another man's "dirty", I guess this is
subjective.

good for shell scripts, not clear it is better for C programs
that have to open a bunch of files by name.

Wonderful, but isn't the key here how simple it is for HAL
or X to understand and use the kernel API rather than the
developers of the kernel driver that implements the API?
If X were a shell script, I'd say a file per value would
clearly be the way to go, but it isn't.
