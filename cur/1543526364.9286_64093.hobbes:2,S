...which generally makes them much better at knowing the right way things
*should work*.  If you put someone naive in front of a computer and pay
attention to what they do, you generally find that their first instincts are
good.  It generally doesn't work, but it's not their fault for trying.
Pulling a disk out in the middle of a write is just asking for it, but is it
not reasonable to expect the machine to cope when you pull out an (apparently)
completely idle piece of media?
