As a further suggestion, I wonder do we really need i_private at all?
Since we have sb->s_op->alloc_inode and inode->i_sb->s_op->destroy_inode
if all filesystems did something along the following lines:
struct myfs_inode {
	struct inode i_inode;
	...
};
#define MYFS_I(inode) container_of((inode), struct myfs_inode, i_inode)
then it would seem that i_private is redundant. If there is a file
system which does genuinely need a pointer here (if indeed such a
filesystem does exist, I haven't actually checked that) then a pointer
can just be added as the one single other member of (in my example)
struct myfs_inode.
Steve.
