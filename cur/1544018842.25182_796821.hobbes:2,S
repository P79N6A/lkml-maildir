Agreed. In fact I have run a few tests even with your patch and I could
see no obvious figure starting to appear. I'll go back to 2.6.27-stable
+ the fixes because I don't really know what I'm testing under 2.6.29-rc2.
Once I'm able to get reproducible reference numbers, I'll test again
with the latest kernel.

Willy
