This is actually part of my strategy.
By properly organizing the deferred queues into lists of lists and
maintaining a small per-cpu cache of pages, a "cache fill" involves
doing a single list deletion under the zone->lock and the remainder
of the work to fill a pagevec occurs outside the lock, reducing the
mean hold time down to ridiculous lows. And since the allocations
are batched, the arrival rate is then divided by the batch size.
Conversely, frees are also batched and the same effect achieved with
the dual operations.
i.e. magazines for the page-level allocator
This can't be achieved with a pure buddy system, as it must examine
individual pages one-by-one to keep the bitmaps updated. Vahalia
discusses the general approach in another section, and integration with
buddy systems (and other allocators) in an exercise.
Cheers,
Bill
