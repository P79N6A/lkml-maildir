That comes almost directly from the BIOS, the screen_info struct is
filled by the real mode boot code (vga.S IIRC).

The vesafb option to override stuff.

Thats kida silly, but as I've found some simliar construct in the old
code I left it in to avoid breaking stuff.  Guess there is a reason that
this was there.  I'll take that as proof that broken BIOSes exist which
don't fill screen_info.lfb_size correctly ;)

Hmm, how identify them?  Map the BIOS and poke around there?
screen_info gives next to no info here.
Maybe it works better to walk the PCI device list, find the correct
gfx card using the framebuffer start address, then double-check the
size by looking at the PCI ressources?
