I didn't know the scsi_hostadapter request - which left me without a way
to load in ppa. In the kernel docs it _is_ cited in the modules.txt but
I'm always left wondering why I'm the only one who doesn't know what
sound-slot-* and sound-service-*-* and so on. Is there an easy way to know
what means what?

What happens when you _do_ have more than one scsi adapter? Is this a case
where a double scsi_hostadapter alias would be useful? I do have two scsi
adapters on this box (well, ppa and a 53c400a card) but the card has
refused to work under linux, so it hasn't been a problem yet. I guess scsi
is the only case where I can see this need so far.
