A slight problem with that is that not all parts of /proc/sys get renamed
this way:
snapcount:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf# ifconfig lo down
snapcount:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf# ip link set name lo0 lo
snapcount:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf# ls -l
total 0
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 Mar 29 13:16 all
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 Mar 29 13:16 default
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 Mar 29 13:16 eth0
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 Mar 29 13:16 lo
Which can be very confusing. This problem exists in both 2.5 and 2.4.
