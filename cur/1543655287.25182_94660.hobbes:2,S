Hi
I want to implement a kind of module autoloading mechanism.
The situation is the following: There are two modules A and B,
where A needs module B to be loaded under certain (runtime)
conditions.
First I thought the solution would be pretty simple. I wanted to
use a function like find_module from kernel/module.c to search
module_list for a module of a certain name. If it is not there
request_module would be used to load the module and afterwards
another find_module call should return a pointer to the module
if the call succeeded.
Unfortunately this solutions does not work in general as
module_list is not exported which means that I'm getting those
nasty 'unresolved symbol' messages when insmoding module A.
Any suggestions? Thanks for your help.
Thomas
