Yes, it is a known problem, turned up by some the posix timers tests. 
  I suppose it is too much to ask, but it would be nice if 
do_sys_settimeofday() took a timespec instead of a timeval.  Of course 
this changes the interface for all the archs, but it would allow the 
clock_settimeofday to send in the nsec value.
