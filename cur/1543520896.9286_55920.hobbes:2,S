Ok. That does only happen when i82365 support is enabled. But when i 
disable it as you requested us to do, nothing works: modprobe/insmod simply
refuse to load yenta.o ("couldn't find the kernel version the module was
compiled for"). Now how did that ever happen?  Do i need to compile Cardbus
as intrinsic driver instead of loadable module?

Yep. Compiling USB as module gave me my keyboard/mouse back.  Funny...
