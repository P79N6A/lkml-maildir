No, I mean voltage sensors. They are on same smbus as thermal sensors,
yet their are not normally accessible using ACPI. I can talk to smbus
controller directly, but acpi may decide to read temperature while I'm
reading voltage, leading to armagedon.
How is that solved?

Well, I thought that "simple" specs looks reasonable, I did not look
at "advanced" metolious. But it seemed sane (*).

I have seen desktop machine that can control CPU fan (altrough it is
slow/fast not on/off) and has thermal zone. It would be nice to be
able to check voltages in a safe way...
