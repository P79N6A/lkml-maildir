I've been running -mm for about a year now, and the whole thing with 2.6.11.x 
releases coming out quite often is a little confusing. Does 2.6.11-mm4 still 
apply to 2.6.11 (no bloody 1, 2, 3, or 4), and if so, what does -mm4 contain 
from the .x versions (ie, does -mm4 contain the updates from 2.6.11.3 or 4 as 
well?)
