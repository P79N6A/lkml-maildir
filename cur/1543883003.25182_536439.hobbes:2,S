I'd like to suggest a few straightforward additions to the proposal:
(1) the interface to the page allocator tries to allocate N pages where
	(a) N is a power of 2
	(b) some effort is made to get contiguity
	(c) some effort is made to fall back to lesser contiguity
	(d) some effort is made to get N pages even with no contiguity
(2) a corresponding group freeing interface to the page allocator
(3) Pass the pages around in a list or similar so that O(1) instead of
	O(pages) splice operations under the lock suffice for passing
	them around. Dissecting compound pages outside locks helps.
