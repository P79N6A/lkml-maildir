I've just seen that Linus has merged my second patch, so here is one more 
missing piece to fix ia64 in ia32 emulation as well.

p.s. this patch has not been tested due to lack of hardware

[PATCH] i386: fix stack alignment for signal handlers (ia64)
This fixes the setup of the alignment of the signal frame, so that all
signal handlers are run with a properly aligned stack frame.
The current code "over-aligns" the stack pointer so that the stack frame
is effectively always mis-aligned by 4 bytes.  But what we really want
is that on function entry ((sp + 4) & 15) == 0, which matches what would
happen if the stack were aligned before a "call" instruction.
[ This patch fixes ia64. i386 and x86_64 are already fixed by
  git commit d347f372273c2b3d86a66e2e1c94c790c208e166 ]
