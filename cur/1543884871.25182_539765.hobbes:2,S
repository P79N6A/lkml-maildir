I know it's a little thing, but given a choice between
a) changelogs which use capital letters and fullstops and
b) changelogs which do not,
I think a) gives a better result.
I note that none of these patches added a #include <linux/mutex.h>.  Each C
file which uses mutexes should do that, rather than relying upon accidental
nested includes.  I hope you're checking for that.
