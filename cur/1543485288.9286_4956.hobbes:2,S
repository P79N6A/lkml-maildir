Probably off-topic for linux-raid, so I'm moving it over to 
linux-kernel,(is there an ext2 mailing list?) but I've seen 
Stephen talking about ACLs a few times recently -- what's the 
status of getting ext2 support for capabilities in the early 
2.3.x series?  Is this going to be done in the ACL patches[1], 
or is there plan to do it at a higher level (VFS)?  I would 
dearly love to see filesystem support for capabilities and am 
willing to put some effort in to doing it -- my C skills are 
quite good, but kernel hacking is still a new area.  If anyone
has ideas for what abstraction layer this should go at I'm
willing to take a stab at doing it -- all hints will be 
gratefully accepted.  Presumably if it's not done in ACLs then
there will have to be some sort of representation for forced
capability bits added elsewhere.
Background: I'm developing some security daemons including 
key-management facilities.  I don't like making a daemon setuid 
just so it can mlock private keys in memory.  (Aside: is there a
standard place to upload US-developed crypto so I can distribute 
it at least in the States without violating EAR/ITAR?)
I read linux-kernel on Web archives, so expect a 24+ hour 
turnaround if you don't CC me.
