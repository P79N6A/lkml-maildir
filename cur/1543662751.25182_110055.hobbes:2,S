From my experience, many video chipsets are not VGA compatible in
this regard. If you have documentation for your chipset, maybe using 
chipset specific code is preferable.

You can see code that implements vertical blanking interrupts in svgalib
(

). This includes standard VGA, as
well support for a few chipsets. Unfortunately, it does not work on my
trident card.
