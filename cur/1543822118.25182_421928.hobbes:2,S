I've been running Gentoo for over month with a 54GB ext3 filesystem via
dm-crypt on an IDE drive. No problems so far.
I've used Gentoo-sources 2.6.16-r1 and vanilla kernels 2.6.17-rc1
through rc3.
I've been using cryptsetup-1.0.1-i686-pc-linux-gnu-static and have it in
my initrd so I can mount my root partition.
