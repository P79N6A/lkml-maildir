There's no need for a vote.  Users already vote for a maintainer when
they decide to use a paticular kernel tree.
No user is forced to follow a particular maintainer.  And anyone can step
up and declare that they are also offering a maintained tree.
And this situation is already self correcting; if no users follow, it's
unlikely that a maintainer will continue doing the required work.  And
if a maintainer doesn't do a satisfactory job, it's very unlikely many
people will choose to use that tree.
