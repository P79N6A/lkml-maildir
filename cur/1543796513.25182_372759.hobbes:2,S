Well ... if you suspect your storage/hardware, then try a different
file system, such as network files or /dev/ramdisk.
It's a few seconds worth of difference you're dealing with, so try
playing around with printf's in the user code and printk's in the
kernel at key points in the sequence of events, so you can see what
happens when.
