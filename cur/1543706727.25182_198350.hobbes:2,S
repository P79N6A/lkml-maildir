Just for consideration and nesting should _not_ be increased ;)
80 is quite OK but has not much margin and is asking for more lines
times with nesting of 3.	
0	1	2	3	4					        |<81
	
		printk(KERN_WARNING "Warning this is a long printk with "
						"3 parameters a: %u b: %u "
						"c: %u \n", a, b, c);
		next_statement;
		printk(KERN_WARNING "Warning this is a long printk with "
			"3 parameters a: %u b: %u "c: %u \n", a, b, c);
		next_statement;
96 is not excessive and will reduce linecount and often makes things more readable.
