Yes. Block->File and Block->Crypto->Block are two different things and
should be separated out. But it would be an easy one to make cryptsetup
also call losetup if your specified backend happens to be a file. Like
mount -o loop does. The only thing I'm not sure about: How would it know
when to remove the loop device on "cryptsetup remove" and when now.
mount stores it in the mtab.
I've got some free time, I think I'm going to rewrite cryptsetup as a
small C program today.

Yes, for example.

For dm-crypt I've set up a small page:
http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/
For device-mapper and loopback there's nothing. The loop device provides
block devices, device-mapper can use them. Nothing special here.
