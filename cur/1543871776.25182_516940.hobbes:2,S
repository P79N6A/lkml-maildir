That seems bad. With the current way you're doing it, if I mount
hierarchies A and B on /mnt/A and /mnt/B, then initially all tasks are
in /mnt/A/tasks and /mnt/B/tasks. If I then create /mnt/A/foo and move
a process into it, that process disappears from /mnt/B/tasks, since
its nsproxy no longer matches the nsproxy of B's root container. Or am
I missing something?
