I'm happy to see the cleanup of scheduler code that went into
2.4.15/16.  One small difference in behavior (I think) is that
the currently running task is not given preference over other
tasks on the runqueue with the same 'goodness' value.  I would
think giving the current task preference is a good thing
(especially in light of recent discussions about too frequent
moving/rescheduling of tasks).  Can someone provide the rational
for this change?  Was it just the result of making the code
cleaner?  Is it believed that this won't really make a difference?
