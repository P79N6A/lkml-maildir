Yes, but as I said so, I couldn't get any relevent trace on the P4/SMP
box, where the issue means real trouble -- the system just locks up while
serial console's annoyingly quiet about it.
Did you notice about nmi_watchdog=1? As it seems, '/etc/init.d/alsasound
stop' just runs smoothly then.
The dump I sent is in fact taken from my P4/UP desktop, and I thought it
was somewhat related. Indeed, I cannot see it happenning anymore since
running RT-0.7.25-1.
I will try RT-0.7.26-4 later on.
Seeya.
