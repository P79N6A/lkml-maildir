To quote from the man page for "stat(2)":
"The value st_blksize [which is the "IO Block:" field in the stat(1)
output you are referring to above] gives the "preferred" blocksize for
efficient file system I/O.  (Writing to a file in smaller chunks may
cause an inefficient read-modify-rewrite.)"
And this is what it is saying.  In the new NTFS driver doing any form of
i/o is most efficient if it is done in 4096 byte chunks, i.e. a single
read or write of 4096 bytes will be faster than reading or writing a
single byte 4096 times over.  The old NTFS driver didn't really care.
IMO 512 would have been a better value to 1024 as the driver uses 512
byte i/o requests but it doesn't really matter much.
To summarise: the st_blksize/"IO Block" has absolutely nothing at all to
do with the cluster size of the NTFS volume.
Best regards,
