Yes on both counts.  I double-checked the configs.  I'm using quilt
and the RT patch is at the end of my series, so it was easy to
pop the patch and try again (module .config fixups).
I may take a few more blind stabs at different configs before
I go diving into the networking code trying to trace something.
(or before starting to bisect the patch).  Bisecting the patch
will be a bit painful since it's currently an all-in-one.

OK.  This is REALLY helpful info.  I'll take a look.
