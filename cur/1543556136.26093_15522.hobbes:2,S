Yes.  This problem has been reported by two others on the
Linux USB Development list.  It is being explored.
If you'd like to contribute to testing whatever patches get
offered to fix this bug, you could send a note saying so to
linux-usb-devel@sourceforge.net.  If you want to stay in the
loop on USB development, you might also want to join the
Linux-USB-Users list.  You can join by filling out the form here:

Best wishes and thanks for the bug report!
