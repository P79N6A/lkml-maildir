Ah, sorry, I've just realized I was wrong.  Processes in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
cannot be frozen!  So, the above only applies to wake_up_interruptible().
You don't need to call wake_up() from .resume(), because there are no tasks
to be notified this way and you shouldn't call wake_up_interruptible() from
there.
Greetings,
