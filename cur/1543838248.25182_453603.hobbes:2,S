In menuconfig, at least:
	"Memory split (3G/1G user/kernel split)  --->"
Inside of "Processor type and features".

The trouble is that the help text is associated with the top-level
"choice" Kconfig entry, not the _individual_ choices.  There is no
symbol associated with the top-level one.  It might be useful to allow
help text to be associated with individual "choice" entries, to display
that text in the high-level option, and to replace the "null" symbol
with something that says "this choice can select any of these symbols:
FOO, BAR, etc..."
I'm sure the Kconfig folks take patches. :P
