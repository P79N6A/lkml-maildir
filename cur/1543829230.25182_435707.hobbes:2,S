No, it's never worked on all machines.
What happens is that the IO window size just changes where things are 
allocated, which breaks things on one machine and fixes it on another. The 
reason tends to be some random hidden IO address that the kernel doesn't 
know about.
So yes, that particular machine may have worked in 2.4.x. Then we fixed 
something, and other machines started working, and that one broke.
I'd rather try to understand why the 256-byte IO window doesn't work on 
that particular machine than try to just randomly change it to hide the 
problem just on that machine again.
