I gave this (pulled into linus' bk current) a try on my laptop.
It has this pata chip:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 82815 815 Chipset Host Bridge and Memory Controller Hub (rev 04)
00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82801BAM IDE U100 (rev 03)
aka
00:00.0 Class 0600: 8086:1130 (rev 04)
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0
        Memory at e8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
00:1f.1 Class 0101: 8086:244a (rev 03)
        Subsystem: 8086:4541
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0
        I/O ports at bfa0 [size=16]
I left out the regualt ide support and added:
CONFIG_SCSI_ATA=y
CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_PATA=y
CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_ATAPI=y
CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_PIIX=y
The laptop has its fixed drive at hda, its fixed cd/dvd at hdb and
its media bay drive (whatever may be installed) at hdc.
root=/dev/sda3 failed to find the root fs.
I don't have anything here to plug into the serial port, so I cannot
record the boot messages.  
Is my controller among the supported PIIX/ICH PATA chipsets?
