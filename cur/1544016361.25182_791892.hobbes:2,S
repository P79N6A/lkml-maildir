mp_apicaddr is getting its value from apicaddr which is u32
(arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c)
 OR
mp_apicaddr is getting its value from apicaddr which is u32
(arch/x86/kernel/mpparse.c)

mp_apicid is getting its value from uniq_ioapic_id(id) which returns
u8 (arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c)
 OR
mp_apicid is getting its value from reg_00.bits.ID which also 8 bits
(arch/x86/kernel/io_apic.c)
 OR
mp_apicid is getting its value from apicid which also 8 bits
(arch/x86/kernel/mpparse.c)
and
mp_dstapic is getting its value from mp_apicid which is already 8 bits
(arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c)
 OR
mp_dstapic is getting its value from mpc_intsrc->dstapic which is
already 8 bits (arch/x86/kernel/mpparse.c)
By using current structure we are wasting space as well as creating
confusion for checking u8 <-> u32 and u32 <-> u64.
