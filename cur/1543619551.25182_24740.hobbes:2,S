The notion of "volume group" and "physical volume", etc. does
not exist in the device mapper.
It is really much lower-level.
As it is, it could be used for partitioning as well, with a single
LOC changed.  In fact, I imagine it's a 100 LOC or so in libparted to
get partprobe to use it.  Then we could retire all partition code
from the kernel :)

It's good to *support* reading metadata, but better to not require it.

Why?  Just because device_mapper itself doesn't support discovery
doesn't mean you can't do the discovery for it, and setup the
devices in-kernel.
I think a bigger issue will be the difference in interface for
EVMS stuff, like all the plugin ioctls... it would be great if
you could:
* decouple the evms runtime (kernel code) from the evms
engine (userland).  Something like libparted's PedArchitecture
would be nice.
* get everyone in the linux community to agree on some standard
ioctl's that provide an interface for everything that evms
(and everyone else) needs.
How hard is this to do?
