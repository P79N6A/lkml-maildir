First, if you want the reserved memory areas to be left alone by swsusp,
you need to mark them as 'nosave'.  On x86_64 this is done by the function
e820_mark_nosave_range() in arch/x86_64/kernel/e820.c that can be ported to
i386 with no problems.  However, we haven't found that very useful, so far,
since no one has ever reported any problems with the current approach,
which is to save and restore them.
Second, if you want to know if a suspicious page frame is saved by swsusp,
it's best to stick a test and a printk in kernel/power/pack_pfns() and
artificially fail the suspend, eg. by making swsusp_write() always return
an error.

Sorry, no patches this time.  I have more urgent problem to fix. :-)
