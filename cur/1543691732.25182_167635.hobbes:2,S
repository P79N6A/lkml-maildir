   I don't know if this comes under the heading of "SiI3112 bugs", but
Adaptec AAR-1210SA still doesn't work for me (and I've seen one other
identical report on LKML in the last fortnight).
   Any attempt to access the drive (Seagate Barracuda V) causes this
to happen:
Sep 22 20:56:00 src@vlad kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
Sep 22 20:56:10 src@vlad kernel: hda: DMA interrupt recovery
Sep 22 20:56:10 src@vlad kernel: hda: lost interrupt
   Data does eventually get to/from the drive, but so slowly as to be
unusable.
   Hugo.
