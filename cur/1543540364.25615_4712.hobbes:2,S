Try getting some old terminal servers. At our university we used the
ones
that were thrown out to make the serial lines accessible via telnet.
Those servers were configurable that each serial line is reachable
via a different port. Combined with a "console" script which
automatically
chooses the right terminal server and port nr. this was a pretty
comfortable
way to monitor everything you dream of.
Cheers,
Walter
