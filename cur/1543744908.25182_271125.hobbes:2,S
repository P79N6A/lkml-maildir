;) My question wasn't "how does ipsec rules looks" but "why its 
implemented such a way".
These almost exactly are rules I want to implement.
But, when you run tcpdump -nni eth0 you can see ESP traffic _and_ one 
direction of something going through IPsec.
Imagine, that on eth0 five IPsec tunnels are "ended" and only one I wish 
to allow tcp/389.
It seems not possible to just allow tcp/389 from only one VPN because IP 
addresses are changing daily
in all 5 remote locations.
Moreover "-i eth0 -j DROP" blocks IPsec traffic ... (or -o eth0 i don't 
remember direction)

And thats the issue - WHY it is implemented such a way ?
Which developement considerations caused that choice ?
