Many ( many ) times, when you're going to wait for events, you want to
specify a maximum wait time ( reletive time ) and not an absolute time.
This is how ppl think about "timeouts". Different beast is the absolute
timer, that you can easily achieve with POSIX timers ( TIMER_ABSTIME ) and
a sigfd() dropped inside an event retrieval interface.
