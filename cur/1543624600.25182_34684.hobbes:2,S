Yes, I'll try to send some in.  When 2.5 had just started I figured
Linus was busy enough with the bio stuff and the driver updates could
wait, since then I've been busy with other things so I haven't gotten
around to sending patches.
AFAIK none of the APIs which are relevant to me have changed so it
should just be a matter of copying the files across from 2.4.
