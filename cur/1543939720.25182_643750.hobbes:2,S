Hmm, I'm thinking too much about RT where we can see who owns the locks.
It isn't trivial to see if current has the lock without putting in more
logic into the taking of the rq lock, which is unneeded overhead.
I think the patch as is is good enough then. The worst that can happen is
that we don't wake up klogd, and that should not be too often.
