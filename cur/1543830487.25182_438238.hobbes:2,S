Is there some way to make it clear _what_ the suffix we expect to remove 
actually is in GNU make? Ie the "shell" kind of "basename" logic.
Ie, I'd personally be happier with a 
	modname = $(basename $(basetarget) .mod)
kind of thing (yeah, this obviously does _not_ work)
Gah. I've happily been trying to avoid having to know all the GNU Makefile 
magic. Sam, does Dans patch make sense and can you explain what went 
wrong? I'd happily revert the revert and instead use Dans patch, I just 
want to understand it..
