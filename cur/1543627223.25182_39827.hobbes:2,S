sorry for the long lines, but it would't be very readable otherwise
:)
$ locate libbfd | xargs ls -ld
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root       632951 Apr 10 15:18 /usr/lib/libbfd-2.12.so
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       737648 Apr 10 15:18 /usr/lib/libbfd.a
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          771 Apr 10 15:18 /usr/lib/libbfd.la
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           14 Apr 10 15:24 /usr/lib/libbfd.so -> libbfd-2.12.so
$ locate bfd.h | xargs ls -ld
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       134077 Apr 10 15:18 /usr/include/bfd.h
