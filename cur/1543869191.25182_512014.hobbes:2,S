You are assuming nothing else is changing the hardware behind the driver's
back.  I am against such assumptions when they can be avoided, but that's a
particular PoV and not much more than that.  IMHO, if you cannot query the
hardware, you shouldn't provide a way to query the current brightness that
will be right only if nobody else messed with the device.
Maybe for corgi, that doesn't hold much strength, but for stuff tied to
ACPI, it does.  And in a ThinkPad's case, where even writes to /dev/nvram
can change the brightness, well, if there weren't a way to ask the EC the
current real brightness, there is NO way I'd be implementing it based on a
memory cache.

I will read the corgi driver code, it looks interesting.

No, it really isn't much trouble.  Which is why I wrote a patch right away.

I.e. we should add hooks to the framebuffer drivers?  It would work, that's
for sure.
