And if they're not using an LM Domain?
Sorry, but I don't know anything about writing drivers under Linux yet...just 
starting so I can get voice over IP working on a proprietary card.  However, 
I thought I'd interject some ideas, to give you some ideas on how to improve 
the initial ideas.  It sounds useful, but even in my highly unspecialized 
environment, it wouldn't work because I don't use a domain controller, and I 
don't use shadow passwords, not PAM.
Most of the machines on our network use Slackware (which doesn't use PAM), and 
they're running on a Windows workgroup, not a domain.
