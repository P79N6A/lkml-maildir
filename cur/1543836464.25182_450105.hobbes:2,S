Right, thanks.  Look at the diffstats there.
This:
init/main.c                  |    2 +
kernel/exit.c                |    2 +
kernel/fork.c                |    2 +
fs/proc/base.c               |   19 +++++++++++++++++++
include/linux/sched.h        |    4 +
is the *entire* impact on existing kernel code.  Sweet.
