I agree, but we can also easily resolve this by scaling the ppm
adjustment to the interval length, rather then just applying it as
usec/sec. No?
So instead of:
	adjusted_length = NSEC_PER_SEC + time_adj
We could do:
	adjusted_length = ntp_interval_length + 
				(ntp_interval_length * time_adj)/MILLION
So this fixes the time_adj scaling error, while letting us be more
flexible w/ our interval length, so we can better map the requested
length to the clocksource granularity, lessening the granularity error.

Right, but the acpi_pm's frequency isn't 3579000. It's supposed to be
3579545. That is injecting error, and I believe it to be different then
what I'm claiming is achieved by CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST.
Further, the specific example above was agreeing with you that  that
CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST=0 looks ok for NOHZ, with the exception in the case of
the jiffies clocksource.
That one still has the 153ppm drift. What do we do about that?

While not the main point, the aside I included about the acpi_pm being
interesting, is that because the ACPI PM's frequency is a multiple of
the PIT's (and thus jiffies), the same granularity issues arise
(although to a lesser degree). That is why CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST helps it in
the !NOHZ case.

Unless you want to clarify what aspect of "quality" you're talking
about, I'd very much disagree with your claim. This is not cosmetics,
this is about addressing granularity error.
By using a base interval that does not match the clocksource's natural
granularity, we effectively inject a per-interval error. Since the error
is tracked and compensated by the clocksource_adjust() function, we end
up with a incorrect clocksource frequency. This then has to be
discovered and compensated for by NTP, in addition to the actual
hardware error.
By using a base interval that does match the clocksource's natural
granularity, we avoid the per-interval error. Without this per-interval
error, we utilize the specified frequency of the hardware, and NTP only
has to correct for the actual hardware error.
If we are building a train station, and each train car is 60ft, it
doesn't make much sense to build 1000ft stations, right? Instead you'll
do better if you build a 1020ft station.
That's what CLOCK_TICK_ADJ is trying to address.
Now, I'm open to doing something other then just adding CLOCK_TICK_ADJ.
For instance, if we find a way to push the initial xtime_interval
(without clocksource_adjust()'s adjustments - see the mult-adj-split
patch from my patchset friday) back to the ntp code so it uses that as
its interval base, and then use the time_adj scaling pointed out above.
That I think would work.

Explain hiding it. I'm just making sure we do equal comparisons. If
ntp_update_frequency() is using CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST, so should the
clocksource_calculate_interval() functions. 
And yes, if we remove CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST, that would also resolve the 
(A!=B) issue, but it doesn't address the error from #2 below.

Wrong. We're using a base interval that maps to the granularity of the
PIT/jiffies clocksource. It doesn't matter too much for other
clocksources, as they're fine grained enough to not really matter, esp
if NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ is 2.

Uh. Check that again. I'm seeing the 11230ppm error only when looking at
the _granularity error_ when CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST is *not* used (where
CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST is used, we get 1.2ppm granularity error).
To see the maximum NTP adjustment error caused by the nsec-per-sec==ppb
shortcut, its:
(NSEC_PER_SEC + 500,000)/NSEC_PER_SEC - (NSEC_PER_SEC + CLOCK_TICK_ADJ +
500,000)/(NSEC_PER_SEC + CLOCK_TICK_ADJ) = -5689ppb error
So even here, in the case where a *very* poor HZ value is selected given
the CLOCK_TICK_RATE (its that train station analogy again), the error
from point #3 is fairly small.

On this I agree. If we're using fine grained clocksources,
CLOCK_TICK_RATE makes less and less sense. But it also should hurt less,
due to the granularity error being smaller on those clocksources. And
yes, one could imagine a system with multiple course clocks that have
different granularity errors and in that case CLOCK_TICK_RATE doesn't
address everything.
However right now CLOCK_TICK_RATE is important for very course
clocksources such as jiffies and the PIT. And many systems use those
clocksources (it should be noted, EVERY non GENERIC_TIME arch uses the
jiffies clocksource as its clocksource), so it effects many users. Until
systems do not use those as clocksources (when everyone has very fine
grained clocks) we need a solution here. I'm not seeing how your
suggestions solve this.

Oh yes. Setting it correctly is a responsibility of the arch maintainer.
If the arch has a incorrect CLOCK_TICK_RATE, it will very much do damage
to the accuracy of the jiffies clocksource and will hurt timekeeping. 
However, if we just remove CLOCK_TICK_RATE, we will hurt the jiffies
clocksource as well.
Overall, I think I agree with your basic dislike for CLOCK_TICK_RATE,
but I do not see how we just get rid of it as you suggest and still have
good timekeeping for all systems.
So again I claim these are the issues, in severity order:
1) A!=B interval comparison needs to get solved. This is just a brain
dead source of large error, and is easily fixed one way or the other.
2) We need a solution that handles granularity error well, as this is a
moderate source of error for course clocksources such as jiffies.
CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST does cover this fairly well in most cases. I suspect
we could do even better, but that will take some deeper changes.
3) We should make sure the even smaller error done by not scaling the
ntp frequency adjustment to the interval length is corrected.
My approach solves only #1. #2 is addressed as CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST handles
it relatively well in most cases. I've proposed that we scale the
frequency adjustment properly to handle #3.
My understanding of your approach (removing CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST),
addresses issues #1 and #3, but hurts issue #2.
So have we talked this out enough? :) 
If I'm still mis-characterizing your solution, feel free to send a patch
and I'll try to refine my critique.
