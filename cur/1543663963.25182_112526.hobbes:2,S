Hi Krishnakumar,
"Am I right in assuming that Linux doesn't enable DMA on this controller? How do I
determine if DMA is enabled for a ide controller apart from relying on the
boot message?"
As you suspect, you're getting DMA all right -- you see it in the boot message too, 
as UDMA(133). To confirm, issue
hdparm /dev/hde
Looks good!
Cheers,
Peter
