Easy answer: yes
Harder answer - It was done a couple of years ago using an Adaptec controller,
and the implementation was used for a TCP stack allowing 180-200 MB/Sec network
layer. The network was about 4 feet long I believe.
Another use for such a thing: Using Linux for implementation of a hardware
RAID layer attached via SCSI cable.
A third use: short range distributed lock manager for a distributed filesystem
or NAS with a Linux based controller. This gets interesting when you start
adding security labels to the data, preventing unauthorized access to
partitions.
Much of the same applications can be done over GigE cards now, so the desire
to standardize a SCSI implementation waned.
