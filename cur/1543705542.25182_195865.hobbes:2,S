The crc32 code came from linux@horizon.com with the following
copyright abandonment disclaimer, which is still in lib/crc32.c:
/*
 * This code is in the public domain; copyright abandoned.
 * Liability for non-performance of this code is limited to the amount
 * you paid for it.  Since it is distributed for free, your refund will
 * be very very small.  If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
 */
Thus GPL plus additional rights is appropriate.
Thanks,
Matt
