Mostly problems with auto-negotiation it seems.  Earlier 2.4 kernels
just would never go 100bt/FD.  Later (broken) versions would claim to
be 100bt/FD, but they still showed lots of collisions and frame errors.
I'll try the ZYNX on the latest kernel in the next few days and let you
know what I find...

The API has been there since 2.1.x, and yet few drivers support it?  I
can see why Ingo decided to fix the problem generically.  I think it would
be great if his code printed a log message upon trigger that basically said:
"You should get yourself a NAPI enabled driver that does flow-control if
possible."  That may give the appropriate visibility to the issue and let
the driver writers improve their drivers accordingly...
