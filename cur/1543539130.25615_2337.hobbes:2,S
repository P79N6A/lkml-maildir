Hi,
seems you have forgotten siginfo. In 2.4 it is supposed to work even 
for normal signals like SEGV and can be used to figure out details
about the cause of the signal in a mostly architecture independent
way. Very nice for people who like playing tricks with memory 
protection. Writing special handlers for every architecture or even 
every signle chip (eg for m68k..) was a real pain.
Bye
Richard
