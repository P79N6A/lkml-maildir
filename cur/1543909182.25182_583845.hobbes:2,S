Hello,
	I don't recall discusion about this so here are my 3 cents:
	I like the idea. The numerous responses you got that you made a mistake
and someone else is the maintainer just prove that this kind of information would
be nice to have. Even if it is not going to be included in mainline it is still
nice to have around as a patchset or sth. Personally I often run into trouble finding
right person to CC on patches.
I get the feeling that only the maintainers themselves + a few old geeks here know
who is maintaining what (and which file) ;-) But maybe it's just me.
The rest is as people say. These ~550 patches without 'in reply to' is a nightmare.
Regards,
	Mariusz
