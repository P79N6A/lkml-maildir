I did.  (I use make-kpkg on Debian, so it does another superfluous make
oldconfig, too).  But I tried many other variations before looking at
the Makefile and Config.in itself.

Then isn't it then sane to make FB_MATROX_G450 to "bool" and not
"tristate", because selecting "m" does _nothing_ !

Only for 550 owners, though :-(
BTW, now I _have_ g450 built into the kernel (see signature below) and
both monitors display the same screen.  /dev/fb1 gets registered, and
ttys get moved to it with con2fb, but not to any of the monitors.  Both
monitors still seem to act as /dev/fb0.  The moved tty no longer exist.
Didn't have time to do more research on this.
Thanks.
