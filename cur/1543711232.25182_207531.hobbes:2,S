dunno why but see:
	spin_lock(&mm->page_table_lock);
	page_table = pte_offset_map(pmd, address);
		pte_unmap(page_table);
		spin_unlock(&mm->page_table_lock);
etc...
maybe at some point in the past kmap_atomic didn't disable preempt? Just
guessing.

thanks for the detailed explanation, so I was definitely wrong about
claiming there was more stuff to optimize away with preempt=n, clearly
it's a great feature your atomic copy-user interrupted by the page
fault. Infact I wonder if we should try once more time and go atomic
again. what you're doing right now is:
	kmap_atomic()
	left = copy_user
	kunmap_atomic
	if (left) {
		kmap() <- persistent unscalable
		copy-user
		kunmap
	}
		
I would suggest we should be even more aggressive like this:
        kmap_atomic()
        left = copy_user
        kunmap_atomic
        if (left) {
		get_user()
        	kmap_atomic()
	        left = copy_user
	        kunmap_atomic
		if (left) {
	                kmap() <- persistent unscalable
        	        copy-user
                	kunmap
		}
        }
It's not going to trigger often anyways, but it's only a few bytecodes
more and it sounds more scalable.
