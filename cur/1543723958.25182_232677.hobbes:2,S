If the high priority process was blocked waiting for something (eg.,
data from a device) and the interrupt causes data to be available on the
object the process is blocked on, then the high priority process will be
woken up and will then become runnable again.

The top half interrupt handler just basically puts the interrupt on a
list.  The bottom half handler then runs with a full context and can
schedule.
If the current process was already executing in the kernel, then the
bottom half is delayed until the end of the current call.  Otherwise, it
happens immediately afterward.
