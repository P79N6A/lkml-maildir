Go back and read my mail. In fact, go back and read just about _any_ of my 
mails on the subject. Gop back and read the part you snipped:
 "And if the compiler isn't good enough to do it, then the compiler 
  shouldn't be warning about something that it hasn't got a clue about."
In other words, either gcc should do it right, or it should not be done at 
all. Right now the warning IS GENERATED IN THE WRONG PLACE. Your argument 
seems to be "but that's the place it is generated" is a total 
non-argument. It's just stating a fact, and it's exactly that fact that 
causes the BUG IN GCC.

It is as trivial as it seems, and this is _not_ an out-of-array reference.  
Sorry. C very clearly specifies the layout of arrays (6.5.2.1: last
subscript varies fastest, together with sizeof(array) = sizeof(entry)*n),
which _guarantees_ that the pointers involved in the above calculations
are all within the object, and thus there is _zero_ undefined behaviour.
So if they argued about this on comp.std.c, they either had clueless
people there (in addition to the ones that obviously aren't ;), _or_ you
misunderstood the argument.
