I'm aware of this.
This has nothing to do with the kernel option CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL which Jan 
referred to, and to which I was responding. "aoss" is also not compatible 
with every conceivable program.
This is exactly why the OSS emulation option in ALSA is really a last resort 
and should not be an excuse for people to ignore implementing ALSA support 
directly. More so, it is very good justification for ditching "everything 
OSS" as soon as possible, at least in new software.
