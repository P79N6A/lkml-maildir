include/asm-x86/pgtable.h has
	#define _PAGE_BIT_PSE           7
	#define _PAGE_PSE       (_AC(1, L)<<_PAGE_BIT_PSE)
and
	#define _PAGE_BIT_NX           63
	#if defined(CONFIG_X86_64) || defined(CONFIG_X86_PAE)
	#define _PAGE_NX        (_AC(1, ULL) << _PAGE_BIT_NX)
so (on 32-bit) ~_PAGE_PSE is ~0x80L is 0xffffff7f, which when cast to
64-bit is 0x00000000ffffff7f, so in
	(~PAGE_MASK & ~_PAGE_USER & ~_PAGE_PSE & ~_PAGE_NX)
all the high bits are lost, while the original
	~(PAGE_MASK | _PAGE_USER | _PAGE_PSE | _PAGE_NX)
works as intended, since the bit inversion is done on a 64-bit number.
Maybe all those pagetable bit definitions should use 64-bit (ULL or a 
cast),
as it is now some dangerous detail is hidden behind the macros.  Using 
inline
functions for simple constants seems like overkill to me, but would 
also work
of course.
