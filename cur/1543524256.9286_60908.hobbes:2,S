Linux 2.3.41 will not boot into a ram-disk. The same problem
reported by myself and others on 2.3.39 and 2.3.40 persist.
I submitted a patch for 2.3.39. Maybe it was lost.
Does anybody need a patch to make their Ramdisk support work?
Is the Ramdisk now discontinued?
How about the loop-device?
Cheers,
