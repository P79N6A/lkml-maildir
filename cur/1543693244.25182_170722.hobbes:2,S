Hi Linus,
more patches for s390. 7 this time, one is big and another one is VERY big.
Heiko spent an awful lot of time on porting the zfcp scsi host adapter to
2.6. He is finished with it, the rest is bug fixing. The patch is 14000
lines, so I better not sent this to lkml.
Short descriptions:
1) Base fixes for s390.
2) Common i/o layer fixes. One of the things included is the removal of
   the hack in ccwgroup.c which Christoph Hellwig complained about.
3) dasd driver update. We removed the dynamic major allocation code and
   replaced devnos with busids. We definitly like 20 bit minors :-)
4) Kerner janitors complained about verify_area in the ctc driver.
5) iucv patch. The driver core complained about iucv not having a release
   function. Add one.
6) qeth bug fixes and cleanup. Conny removed the read, write and device
   device pointers from the card structure. Unluckily this touches all
   debug statements which produces a rather big patch.
7) The zfcp host adapter.
blue skies,
  Martin.
