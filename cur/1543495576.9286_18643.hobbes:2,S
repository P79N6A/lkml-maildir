Subject: what happens after jiffies wraparound in 2.[01].x?

The subject says it all. We have a box here whose jiffies will wrap around on
Tue May 18 21:05:54 1999 according to my calculations, can anyone tell me if I
should reboot the box beforehand or what I can expect to happen afterwards?
(The box's role is farily important so I would like to minimize downtime).
Thanks,
Martin
