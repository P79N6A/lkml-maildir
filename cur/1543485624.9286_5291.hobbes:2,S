B get wakenup and runs waking_non_zero that sees sem->waking == 1 and so
do sem->waking-- and then B has no way to runs atomic_inc() because
waking_non_zero returned 1 (owned the semaphore).
after B exit from __down_interruptible, the state of the semaphore is: 
						  0	      0
and not:
>Process B calls atomic_inc(&sem->count)          1           1
Tell me if I missed something.
