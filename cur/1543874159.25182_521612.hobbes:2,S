Not necessarily. Use GID rotations too.
And if you can't assign these properly, it's your own/your distro's fault.

Indeed, it's a drawback. Though a configurable one.

Then, use a group quota. But checking that will be slower, and that
overhead might kill other gains.

Not on desktop.
Typical multi-threaded workloads:
- apache
- some P2P clients
- some audio servers/applications (small number of threads)
Single-threaded is much more popular.

Well, aren't we discussing desktops?
Server admins can fine-tune the rights and CPU quotas per group.

Not necessarily. You see, the processes themselves are schedulable,
the threads aren't.

This kind of scheduler, yes. Except it's much more tunable than a
simple fair or unfair scheduler, and much more suited to real-time
applications.

That's why the per-user or per-group part would have to be optional.
It just doesn't make much sense on single-user desktops.
Then, RSDL design or even RSDL+bonus could be used.
The bonus part would have to be really simple, e.g. priority
inheritance for pipes, startup priority boost for nice 0 tasks.
(warning - fork bombs. :P )
No sleep estimator. Maybe these would suffice?
The interactive bonus would be disabled by default, same as
per-user/per-group scheduling.
Some syscalls would have to be added, maybe using LSM framework?
