hello,
i have a big problem: some servers send a rst-packet or don't answer if i 
want to open a connection with them.
this happens with the web-server with ip 15.200.6.123 and my smc-
barricade router/printserver.
if i make a connection from windows or linux with kernel 2.2, it works, with 
kernel 2.4, i get a rst or no answer and the connection is closed.
i don't know, what is the difference of the tcp-packets from windows/kernel 
2.2 and linux with kernel 2.4. but with kernel 2.4 i have trouble with some 
servers.
i check the packets with an analyser and make some test. if i disable ecn 
with "echo 0x0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn" it works, with ecn enabled, it 
don't work.
goodby
