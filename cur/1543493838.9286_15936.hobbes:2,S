	Hi all sorry to come here with this question as i don't know if it's
kernel specific or not and haven't got a convincing answer in other places , we
got a rockwell PCI fax modem 56K and it just doesn't work under 2.0.x or 2.2.x
so the question is: What do we must do to make the modem work under linux ??
some kernel option required  or it can be done with the pciutils package ?? or
are we out of luck as this is a winmodem ?? (hope the last one is not the
reason :) )....
	thanks !!!!
