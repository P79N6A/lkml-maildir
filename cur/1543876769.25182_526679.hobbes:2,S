You're not making them "a bit" larger, you're adding N+M pointers
where N is the number of container hierarchies and M is the number of
subsystem slots.
Basically, it means that anyone that uses containers without
namespaces or vice versa ends up paying the space overheads for both.

Agreed. So I'm not saying it's fundamentally a bad idea - just that
merging container_group and nsproxy is a fairly simple space
optimization that could easily be done later.
