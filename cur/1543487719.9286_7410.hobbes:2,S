I consider it a violation of the GPL. Its not like OSS sound where the module
interface is simply used (that is viewing the _existing_ exported symbol
set as an API) they actually hack all the code up to call their modules
in ways it was never intended to and then to cripple the resulting code
so it only works across a group of 6 machines.
Linus has sent them a polite explanation of his viewpoint. We shall now see
what happens the friendly way. Hopefully there will be no "after that".
If you absolutely must make your protest felt then I'd suggest you donate
money to palestinian aid causes and tell the Hebrew university why you are
doing it 8). For once a positive way to really annoy them ....
