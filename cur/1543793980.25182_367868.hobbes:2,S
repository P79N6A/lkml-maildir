Thanks. The reason I asked whether it was a Thinkpad is that the DMA 
problems usually occur on Thinkpads. You don't have a thinkpad, and you 
don't see the log messages, so that's not it. The filesystem's block 
bitmaps were OK, so that's not it. Quoting you in your previous message:
# I suspected the hard drive to mess up write requests during spin-up.
# Or perhaps giving some kind of error message, which could trigger a
# bug in a rarely tested error-handling path in the kernel. But the fact
# that you never got similar reports makes this less likely. In the end,

If there are no other reports on different hardware, then I'm afraid you 
might be right about the hardware thing. :( I think problems like these 
usually don't get noticed/fixed because modern Windows versions are 
actually very lousy at spinning down disks -- in my experience it 
doesn't really happen, even though you can set the timeouts.
I'm sorry I'm not able to help you out here.
