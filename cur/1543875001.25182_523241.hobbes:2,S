The deadline mechanism is easy to hit and works. Try printk'ing it. There is 
some leeway to take tick accounting into the equation and I don't believe 
nanosecond resolution is required at all for this (how much leeway would you 
give then ;)). Eventually there is nothing to stop us using highres timers 
(blessed if they work as planned everywhere eventually) to do the events and 
do away with scheduler_tick entirely. For now ticks works fine; a reasonable 
estimate for smp migration will suffice (patch forthcoming).
