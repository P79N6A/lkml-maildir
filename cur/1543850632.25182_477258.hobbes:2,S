Ahhhhhh, but there's a catch...
You can queue up multiple writes, because the data you want
to write to disk is already in memory.
However, at swapin time you need to read the first bit of
data from disk, after which the program can continue, and
only when the next page fault happens you know what data
to read in next.
Linux does some swapin clustering, but there simply is no
way to know which data will be needed next.
This means reads are serialized and synchronous wrt. program
execution, while writes can overlap and be done asynchronously.
It's a miracle reads are going at 50% of the speed of writes...

Let me know when you figure out how to look into the future.
Actually, Keir Fraser and Fay Chang came up with a cool trick.
    "Operating System I/O Speculation:
   How Two Invocations Are Faster Than One"
http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix03/tech/fraser.html
It is somewhat complex though...
