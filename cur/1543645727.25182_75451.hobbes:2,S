This would appear to be a page which was mapped by remap_page_range().
It's not PageReserved, and it has no reverse mapping.
I believe the right fix is to just delete the BUG check at rmap.c:280.
Could you please try that?  An appropriate test would be to play with
the camera while running something which causes tons of swapout.
Rik, that's right, isn't it?
