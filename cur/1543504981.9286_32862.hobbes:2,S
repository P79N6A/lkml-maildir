tkinfo isn't too bad...

Info manuals kick the snot out of man pages when printed and bound, but
for online work, accurate and well written man pages are hard to beat.
I have to echo Jim Gettys' remarks that linux man pages are a mess,
especially compared to, say, NetBSD, where even internal kernel
interfaces and drivers are documented by man pages.
