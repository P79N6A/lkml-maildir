I never proceeded that way, but it is what I observe everywhere nowadays,
not only under Linux: lots of ideas claimed as being highly better that 
the existing stuff and then ... just expected results. ;-)

I didn't wrote that it performs bad in practice, but thinking about SCSI 
disks that are able to handle more than 32 tags and about resonnable 
systems that may use several of them at the same time (I have 7 hard disks 
on my system), I think that the 'one queue problem' is a real penalty.

Compatibility is a requirement, doing different would have been a great
stupidity.

Indeed, it does so.

5 milli-seconds are enough to understand that from the code.

You only thought IDE and it what I pointed out, btw.
For SCSI with 1 queue per device, if we are globally plugged we lose 
time (think of SMP, and interruptions), and if we discard the plug, we 
may break the coalescencing and sorting, and then just provide devices
with bunches small IOs.

IDE protocol does not allow disconnections and tagged queuing. It only
allows 2 drives per controllers and very short cables. The only way to
really enhance IDE is to go to a SCSI-like protocol (or to switch to
SCSI). Any other effort to enhance this thing can only be kind of
band-aiding, in my opinion, whatever it is clean, clever or just stupid.
