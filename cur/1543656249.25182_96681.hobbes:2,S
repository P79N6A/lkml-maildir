Subject: [RFC] linux-2.4.21-pre1_lost-tick_A0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

All,
	On the x440, we occasionally (or not so occasionally) get SMIs that
take longer then a few ticks. This can cause brief inconsistencies in
gettimeofday values, as well as clock drift. This patch is my first
patch at compensating for the lost ticks. This applies on top of the
cyclone-timer_B3 patch. 
Comments, feedback, and flames requested. 
thanks
