Which is totally bogus, because virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt only work on
systems without an IOMMU.  Most if not all ppc64 systems have one or
more IOMMUs.  This patch is nacked.
The correct fix is to make advansys depend on CONFIG_VIRT_TO_BUS, or
alternatively fix advansys.c properly by making it use the interfaces
described in Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt (or the equivalent scsi
helpers).
