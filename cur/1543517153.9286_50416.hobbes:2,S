Yes, I shut down all the NFS processes (switched to single user mode)
before I modified the files but it didnt help anything. I can not get this
directory exportet. I keep getting "permission denied". :-(
And yes, I get something in the messages logfile, but nothing about a wrong
IP address. I get this:
authenticated mount request from <client>:port for /usr/local (/usr/local)
getfh failed: Operation not permitted
So it seems to me that the host is recognized properly but something else
fails. :-(
Any ideas what could be wrong?
