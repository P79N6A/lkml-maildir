In theory, it should audit the actions performed by the sysadmin. This patch 
doesn't cover actions done via X windows interface.

This is what's called out for in various security standards such as NISPOM, 
DCID 6/3, and PCI. Its all about non-repudiation.

Sort of. Its supposed to allow the Security Officer the ability to check on 
what an admin was doing if they were found to be attempting access to 
information outside their duties. Or if something is found to be 
misconfigured, they can backtrack and see how it became that way if that was 
important.
Some people try to be compliant with these security standards with user space  
tools like rootsh, but that is too easy to detect and defeat. And then it 
does not put its data into the audit system where its correlated with other 
system events. 
>What about tty output?
That is not required.
