1. Clarification: The system where 2.4.18rc2, 2.5.5+x
2. Yes I know it is the very same bad workflow of initialization
and deallocation routines. I suppose that the particular cause is
inside the ide_module_t area.
3. I was compleatly ignorant about calling some device eject utilities
or similar.

Andre already asked in private if I would dare to take care of new stuff
comming from him for 2.5.5.
Please note that thus far I didn't see *any* concerete code from him.
But I still don't see any great problems in merging some forthcomming
stuff iff it comes along.
Please see as well the quite nice mode of cooperation I had with
Vojtech Pavlik.
Please note further that the foundations for true hot plugging done the
right way where comming from Pavel Machek i have just picked it up
as well as the _IDE_C mess and some other nit's here and there.
And finally - I don't do anything inside an ebony tower - I just
*post* everything to lkml - whatever finished or not.
Please feel free to discuss it.
Everybody who wants to contribute *please feel free* to post
a ide-clean-11+x.diff. I'm NOT playing hodge on the code at all!
So the political problems you talk about are perhaps just not there...
