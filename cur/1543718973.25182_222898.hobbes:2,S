It affects IDE too - the context switch and interrupt rates are through the
roof.  IDE disks have always seemed better at doing readahead, which is why
the transfer bandwidth is much the same.
Everything there is consistent with "not doing readahead".  The fickle
finger points in the general direction of fs/block_dev.c:do_open().  Later.
