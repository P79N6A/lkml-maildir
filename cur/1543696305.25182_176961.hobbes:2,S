You have this completely backwards. A way to eliminate ide-scsi for cd
burning was invented for 2.6, which is both more efficient wrt space
consumption and cpu usage. Naturally, this is now the preferred way to
burns CD's. It works equally well with whatever burner you have, be it
atapi, scsi, or usb.
ide-scsi being broken is an orthogonal issue. The incentive to fix it
isn't that big, because its area of use has diminished a _lot_.
Just setting the record straight.
