e.g. the stack rlimit looks dangerous, if any VM codepath ever looks
twice on it (and relies on it being the same, somehow).
But if someone reviewed all of the rlimit use in the kernel, we could
make it a policy that rlimits might change. Any unsafe use could be made
safe pretty easily. Since they are ulongs they are updated atomically
even without any locking - but e.g. the default and the hard limit might
change separately. (from the viewpoint of rlimit-using kernel code.)
obviously a remote rlimit must listen to same kind of security
permissions as e.g. ptrace or signal sending.
