This was a project that was never completed.  I thought at one point
of allowing the inode size to be not a power of 2, but if you do that,
you really want to avoid letting an inode cross a block boundary ---
for reliability and performance reasons if nothing else.   
It may simply be easiest at this point to require that the inode size
be a power of two, at least as far as going from 128 to 256 bytes,
just for compatibility reasons.  (Although if we do that, the folks
who want to use extra space in the inode will come pooring out of the
woodwork, and we're going to have to careful to control who uses what
parts of the extended inode.)
In the long run, it probably makes sense to adjust the algorithms to
allow for non-power-of-two inode sizes, but require an incompatible
filesystem feature flag (so that older kernels and filesystem
utilities won't choke when mounting filesystems with non-standard
sized inodes.
