Found the first kernel version with the regression. It's linux-2.6.9-rc1
Perusing lkml from august there was a short thread about the oopses and loss 
of keyboard in X. Applying that information in a crude hack I was able to 
test the effected 2.6.9-rc1 and three -bk forward:

I've since tested and retested for several hours on the different kernels. At one 
point I thought the usage of lapic=lapic made a difference, but it turned 
out to be a red herring.
2.6.8.1-bk2 is without doubt the last kernel to handle my testcase "properly". There 
are no freezes whatsoever and the swapping is finished within 1 minute and 
some seconds.
2.6.9-rc1 and forward all have the freezes. Swapping and readback takes from 
3 to 6 minutes. I can't find a pattern in the time differences.
What's left now is to find some repository which has the gargantuan 2.6.9-rc1 
broken out in its pieces (and I guess 2.6.8.1-bk1 and 2 must be subtracted 
from that). Then reverting patches. A process where I'd need some handholding 
as to what would be likely candidates.
An innocent one is Ingo's "context-switching overhead in X, ioport()" patch. 
I added it to 2.6.8.1-bk2 and it didn't break my testcase.
Ah, well. It's that time of the year, so I won't be able to do any testing until 
the madness is over.
