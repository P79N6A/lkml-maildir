Sorry, no. The idea is to detect a mouse port if it is there, but at the
same time make sure the detection routine does not return "true" if a
port is not present. The patch first tries to write a byte into the aux
port output buffer, and then reads it back. If that succeeds, we have an
aux port. If the write fails, we try exactly the same command with the
keyboard output buffer. We make the assumption that these two commands
are either both implemented, or neither of them are implemented on a
controller with an aux port. If both writes fail, we are back in square
one, and have to try other (not perfectly reliable) tricks to detect the
port. 
Unfortunately, your report tells us that this strategy doesn't work.
Your controller implements one of the commands, but not the other.
