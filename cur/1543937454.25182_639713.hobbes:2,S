This seems similar to one problem we saw yday. May not be specific to
e1000. May be at some generic pci code.
The problem is

>> uncached<->default
Some address range here is being mapped with conflicting types.
Somewhere the range was mapped with default (write-back). Later
pci_iomap() is mapping that region as uncacheable which is basically
aliasing. PAT code detects the aliasing and fails the second uncacheable
request which leads in the failure.
We are trying to find who exactly is mapping this with default at the
beginning.
Balbir: Full dmesg with debug boot parameter may help.
