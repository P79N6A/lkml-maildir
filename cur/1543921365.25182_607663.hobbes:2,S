Subject: [RFC 0/2] readdir() as an inode operation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a first try to move readdir() to become an inode operation. This is
necessary for a VFS implementation of "something like union-mounts" where a
readdir() needs to read the directory contents of multiple directories.
Besides that the new interface is no longer giving the struct file to the
filesystem implementations anymore.
Comments, please?
