I am thinking about kernel include files that do correct preincludes for
type-cleanness and that work if you use them without #defining __KERNEL_

star needs "ext2_fs.h". This file is not usable at all on many Linux 
distributions, even with GCC.
libscg (cdrtools) needs "scsi/sg.h" but it currently includes a lot of other
files:
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include <linux/version.h>
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include <asm/types.h>
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include <scsi/scsi.h>
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include <linux/scsi.h>
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include <linux/fs.h>           /* From ancient versions, really needed? */
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include "block/blk.h"          /* From ancient versions, really needed? */
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include "scsi/scsi.h"
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include "scsi/sg.h"
scsi-linux-sg.c:#include <linux/cdrom.h>
If there wase _one_ clean SCSI pass through interface on Linux,
things would be a lot easier.....
