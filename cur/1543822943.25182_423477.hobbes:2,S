It isn't a bug on systems that support executable shell scripts.
Doing security policy based on programming language seems weird at
best, especially when the only user able to make those decisions is the
superuser.
Obviously the security-unaware people over at the OpenBSD camp must be
completely clueless when they don't disallow the superuser to do this.
I'm looking forward to the day where I'm no longer allowed to make
changes to /etc/ld.so.conf because it's a system file.
Anyway, is it possible to enable this functionality?
