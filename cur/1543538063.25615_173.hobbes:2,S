I really would enjoy to change my cable to the 80conductor type, but it
is just not an option, you just can't find it where I live and import
fee's are as high as 60% and they do afect shipment costs as well.
This cable was used win UDMA33 sucessfuly on my old mother board that
died due to oxidation, it was based on SiS5513(el cheapo mb from
www.pcchips.com.tw) now I replaced it with a Soyo 5EH v1.2 and it
complains a lot.
