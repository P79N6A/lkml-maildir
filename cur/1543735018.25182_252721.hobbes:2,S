Well I do agree there is a strong don't-bother-with-TOE argument: 
Moore's law, the CPUs (manufactured in vast quantities) will usually
However, there are companies are Just Gotta Do TOE...  and I am not 
inclined to assist in any effort that compromises Linux's RFC compliancy 
or security.  Current TOE efforts seem to be of the "shove your data 
through this black box" variety, which is rather disheartening.
Even non-TOE NICs these days have ever-more-complex firmwares.  tg3 is a 
MIPS-based engine for example.

PCI bus tends to be slower than DRAM<->CPU speed, and MTUs across the 
Internet will be small as long as ethernet enjoys continued success.
