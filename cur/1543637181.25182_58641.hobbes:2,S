F_SETLK sorry.
You need to do it on both reader and writer. On the writer it acts
like a fsync(), on the reader it should clear the cache.
I think the problem in your case is that you have the pages mmaped.
NFS uses invalidate_inode_pages() to throw away the cache, but that
doesn't work when the pages are mapped. It may work to munmap/mmap
around the locking.
In theory with rmap (=2.5) the kernel could do that unmap/remap for you,
but it will be probably non trivial to implement.
