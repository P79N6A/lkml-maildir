Well as an update, running 2.6.14 in the last 17 hours, my system gained
26 minutes.  That seems to average gaining 1s every 44s.  So while
better than 2.6.12 by a lot, there is certainly still something odd with
the nforce2 handling.
I think I need to go grab that python script and run it to see how it is
gaining since it doesn't really appear to be at a constant rate.
Maybe I should check if my bios is the latest version.
And I could try with the apic override options.
I will try a few more things to see what is happening.
