Johan,
If you mean occasional lockups, which go away if you do ifdown / ifup,
then try the patch I posted Sunday - it forces one of the bug workarounds
on, which was dependent on eeprom by default. Also has a debug line
which writes out what it thinks the chip ID is, which activates
(or not) the other bug workaround. Alan put some or all of this
patch into the latest -ac; from his docs I couldn't tell whether
he put in the 'always use bug override' bit, and I expect not.
if you want to do it yourself, find where rx_bug is set, and just
set it to 1 the line afterwards, and try that.
Alternatively, try the intel drivers.
Alex
