Hi,
so i have upgraded a system to kernel 2.6.24. After that, it failed to 
boot with the usual message telling, that the rootfs on device /dev/sda1 
  cannot be mounted (a raid1 run by the controller below).
With 2.6.23.12, everything is working fine.

Any ideas?
http://www.kernel.org/diff/diffview.cgi?file=
%2Fpub%2Flinux%2Fkernel%2Fv2.6%2Fpatch-2.6.24.bz2 
show huge drivers/scsi/gdth* related changes.
Can't test at the moment. System went production.
