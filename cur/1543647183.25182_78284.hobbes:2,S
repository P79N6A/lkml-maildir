You guys need to use a better format for emailing Linus...  see his 
posts on the subject, or just use Documentation/BK-usage/bk-make-sum 
script.  Having N diffstat outputs followed by N changeset descriptions 
is just non-sensical.  Linus should not need to count down diffstats to 
figure out which one corresponds to which changeset.
Further, an overall [single] diffstat gives a better picture of what he 
will pull when he does a 'bk pull'...
