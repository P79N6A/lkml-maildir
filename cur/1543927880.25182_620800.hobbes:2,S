See my earlier post in this thread: there's a race in the write loop
where a work struct could be used twice on the same queue.
(Needs data structure change to fix that, which nobody has attempted
to do yet.)
BTW To eliminate any internal lockdep concerns (and people say there
should be no problem) temporarily add a second struct instead of reusing
one on two queues.
