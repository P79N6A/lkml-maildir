There are two problems here. 
It is senseless to make GFP_BUFFER allocations loop inside
__alloc_pages() (calling try_to_free_pages()) because these allocations
_can't_ block.
If there is no free memory, they are going to loop. 
This is "independant" from the highmem deadlock. 
See? 
Now lets talk about the highmem deadlock.

You are not going to fix the problem by _only_ doing this bh allocation
change.
Even if some bh allocators _can_ block on IO, there is no guarantee that
they are going to free low memory --- they may start more IO on highmem
pages.
We cannot treat highmem as "yet another zone" zone. All highmem data goes
through the lowmem before reaching the disk, so its clear for me that we
should not try to write out highmem pages in case we have a lowmem
shortage.
Well, IMO.
