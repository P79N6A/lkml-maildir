Jon, I think the arbiters have to be per-resource rather than per-legacy 
space.  AIUI, the arbiters are there to deal with multiple devices on the 
same bus that respond to the same cycles, like two VGA cards in one legacy 
I/O domain.  You either need to relocate one of them so that they don't have 
overlapping I/O ranges or disable one while you talk to the other.
IOW, legacy space is the whole I/O window of a given bus or PCI domain 
(granularity defined by the platform--some will only have one I/O space), and 
the arbiter's job is to arbitrate access to subsets of each window.  I think 
the the VGA stuff here complements the legacy interface rather than 
conflicting with it.
