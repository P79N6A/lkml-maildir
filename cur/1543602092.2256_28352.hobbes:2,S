Hi,
After upgrading to 2.4.9-ac10 I get this message at boot time while the
system tries to  configure the ethernet card:
8139too Fast Ethernet driver 0.9.18a
PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 00:13.0
eth0: RealTek RTL8139 Fast Ethernet at 0xc28e6000, 00:50:bf:18:ae:5b, IRQ 12
eth0:  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8139B'
eth0: Setting half-duplex based on auto-negotiated partner ability 0000.
task `ifconfig' exit_signal 17 in reparent_to_init
The card gets configured ok, but this message never showed up until now.
Regards,
/me
