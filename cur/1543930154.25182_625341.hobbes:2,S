Andrew, I become too relaxed after receiving
"Tested-by: Giacomo Catenazzi <cate@debian.org>"
Eric, I believe that reverting an original behavior is better than your
new one as
- you introduce search into the depth by calling have_submounts(dentry)
during revalidation for all(!) /proc dentries
- your shadowing behavior will be broken if you'll mount something in
the depth of shadowed tree (this can be done as a DoS attempt)
As a last minute call, may be it will be better to pin network namespace
like a pid namespace during mount to avoid this crap at all?
