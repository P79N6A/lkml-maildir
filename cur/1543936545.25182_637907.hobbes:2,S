I'm going to set-up git tree, yes.
It should support some vaios (newer ones for sure), as far as I know.
The primary reference for the driver is this one:
http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~winbond/
 (link is somewhat slow, but works). Winbond developed GPLv2
driver for linux and there was enough info in their source code for my implementation (totally
different from their's). Some reverse engineering of the windows driver was needed too (for the TI
registers and such).

This is supposed to be a generic layer, akin to mmc. I have a jmicron backend in the works, and
windbond backend will be possible, too.

Considering the previous point this should be ok.

Yes, of course; all structures with "packed" attribute correspond to appropriate protocol ones
(the endianness is tweaked as needed - most, but not all fields, are big-endian).

The access to these fields should be exclusively under q_lock (I'll check the locking again, just
to make sure). After all, the same applies to old fashioned bit masks.

The idea here is that MSPro media have an attribute namespace, which may contain various entries.
Some of them I know how to decode, others I still want to be presented in sysfs for further study
(as hex dumps). Sysfs attr group should be fine, but I was not aware that such thing exists.

The thread is stopped on suspend and restarted on resume.It works on my machine.

There's no IO path at this point, as IO thread was stopped on suspend. The fine point here is that
thread is restarted only with "UNSAFE_RESUME" set, otherwise the block device just sits dead in
the water waiting for the bus driver to kick it out and run the media detection routine anew.

Somebody was already kind enough to fix this.
I hope it'll be ok for me to address the rest of the issues with incremental patches.I expect to
have a web accessible git within a few days.
