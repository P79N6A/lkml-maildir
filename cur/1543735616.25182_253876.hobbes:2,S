    From the code of coreutils 5.2.1, lib/mountlist.c, df uses the
default name for the mounted filesystems table. Under glibc, it uses
_PATH_MOUNTED that is, effectively, "/etc/mtab". BTW, 'MOUNTED' is
shown in glibc headers as a deprecated alias.

    Maybe: df (well, lib/mountlist.c) shouldn't try to 'detect' which
kernel are you running, if one with /etc/mtab or a newer one that
only supports /proc/mounts (which needs procfs support, BTW, and that
can be a problem too). Is glibc who should do all that, and try to
open /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts, in that order. Being a userspace
app, df should not mess with kernel interface changes. In the worst
case, it *could* try to open /etc/mtab (with setmntent, I mean) and
if that fails, open /proc/mounts if the operating system is Linux
(which can be easily decided at './configure' time).
    I'm really not sure about what should be fixed. IMHO, getmntent
should only try to open _PATH_MOUNTED. Any other desired behaviour
should be set using setmntent. Just my 0,02 EUR.
