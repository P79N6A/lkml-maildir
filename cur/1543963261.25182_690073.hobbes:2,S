Hi all,
[The Next/Trees file includes the trees that were removed/not included
today - I will fix my scripts to not do that from now on.]
Changes since next-20080507:
Trees removed: x86-latest, sched-latest, ldp.
Trees not included today: kbuild, wireless.
The v4l/dvb breakage still required a small patch.  I have submitted this
upstream.
The driver-core tree is back (which brings back the usb tree as well).
The ubi tree caused build failure on a powerpc allyesconfig build (and
would do the same for any build where PAGE_CACHE_SIZE is not 4096) and
was reverted for today.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
(tar balls at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sfr/linux-next/
).  If you
are tracking the linux-next tree using git, you should not use "git pull"
to do so as that will try to merge the new linux-next release with the
old one.  You should use "git fetch" as mentioned in the FAQ on the wiki
(see below).
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
a ppc64_defconfig for powerpc and an allmodconfig for x86_64. After the
final fixups, it is also built with powerpc allnoconfig,
44x/ebony_defconfig and allyesconfig.
Below is a summary of the state of the merge.
We are up to 68 trees (counting Linus' and 9 trees of patches pending for
Linus' tree (which are mostly empty)), more are welcome (even if they are
currently empty).  Thanks to those who have contributed, and to those who
haven't, please do.
Status of my local build tests will be at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/linux-next
 .  If maintainers want to give
advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add
more builds.
Thanks to Jan Dittmer for adding the linux-next tree to his build tests
at 
http://l4x.org/k/
 , the guys at 
http://test.kernel.org/
 and Randy
Dunlap for doing many randconfig builds.
There is a wiki covering stuff to do with linux-next at
http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/pmwiki/
 .  Thanks to Frank Seidel.
