i thought this because on my ibook i can see different MHz
entry's when cpudyn changes the frequence.

o.k, when i understand you right p4-clockmod-throttling _is working_
on my system, but i can't see this in /sys until Dave Jones
patches are includet. So i patched my 2.6.6 kernel with
cpufreq-2004-05-13.diff.
Now cpuinfo_cur_freq and scaling_cur_freq show changing entry's
when eg powernowd handles the frequence.
The reason why i want to throttle down my prescott is the heat.
Strange is that when the frequence is changed to 350MHz
(after 30min running with 2.8GHz), neither the CPU&System temperature
nor tools that calculate the CPU speed (like gkrellm-x86info)
show a difference to 2.8GHz. All voltages on my system are the
same with 350MHz/2.8GHz, too.
So i'm not sure if throttling does work until now?
thanks,
clee
