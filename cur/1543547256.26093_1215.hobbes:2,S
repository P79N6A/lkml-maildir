Subject: [Announce] TUX alpha source code release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

We are pleased to announce that the TUX kernel-space HTTP-subsystem is
available for download at:
	
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/tux/tux-hawaii/
WARNING: this is a developer-only, alpha release. The 1.0 'consumer'
release will happen by the end of September. This release is useless to
you unless you are a kernel developer, and even in that case it might eat
your data, start World War III, or drink your coffee. As of now, it is
possible to cause TUX to BUG() via a simple browser URL - sanity checks
are not handled too nicely yet. You have been warned. Further TUX
development will be coordinated through the tux-list@redhat.com mailing
list.  (See the attached README file for how to subscribe.)
Many thanks to Michael K. Johnson and Matt Wilson for making the August
release possible :-)

-----------------------
TUX: The Hawaii Release
This is a developer-only preview of TUX.  It is incomplete; some features
are stubbed out or incompletely implemented, and packaging is incomplete.
It is provided in source-code-only form at this time.  It is not yet
intended for enterprise use.  It has not undergone a security audit.
It is not guaranteed to run SPECweb99 correctly, because there has been
further development since the accepted SPECweb99 runs were done, and
that development may well have diverged from SPECweb99 and web standards
compliance, and has probably changed performance.  It is here so that
developers besides those at Red Hat can participate in the process of
finalizing the TUX APIs, configuration options, and documentation.
  ***   If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
  ***   You have been warned!
The development work will happen on the mailing list tux-list@redhat.com

The packages are included only in source form.  The tux package contains
some basic documentation in Docbook format; if you build the tux
package it will build html documentation from the Docbook.  The kernel
package, when built, builds the tux package, currently only for the i686
enterprise kernel binary package.  Because TUX's memory model clashes
with what is needed for the enterprise kernel, that will change; it's
just a placeholder for now.  The packages have been tested more on the
Pinstripe beta than on Red Hat Linux 6.2 at this time.  They will receive
more testing on Red Hat Linux 6.2 in the future.
We plan to make a full release by the end of September.  That release
will be validated against SPECweb99, will have updated APIs, better
configuration, richer documentation, and will be made more readily
available, with a defect tracking program to support it.
