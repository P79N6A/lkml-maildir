Hi,
I have been been seeing a problem when using sendfile repeatedly on an
SMP server, which I believe is related to the problem that was
discovered recently with marking dirty pages. The bug, as well as a test
script, is listed at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7650.
Currently, we're experiencing errors where part of a previous packet is
being sent out rather than the current packet.
I have applied the patch Linus posted to a 2.6.19 kernel but am still
getting the problem. So I am wondering if there are any other places in
the kernel which mark pages as dirty which might require a similar
patch?
