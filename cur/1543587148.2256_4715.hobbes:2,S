Have you  already  tried  to  measure  how  much  impact has   entropy
gathering on the overall performances?  Something like the Linux Trace
Toolkit (
http://www.opersys.com/LTT/
) could be of help here.
I doubt  such optimization  is useful to  the mainstream  kernel tree,
but it would be interesting to compare numbers nonetheless.
