And this one seems wrong[*] to me too (making it a rofl²).
It is two chars (or one[*]) too long.
Consider this test:
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <string.h>
	int main(void) {
	    printf("%d\n", sizeof("18446744073709551615\0"));
	    printf("%d\n", sizeof("18446744073709551615"));
	    printf("%d\n", strlen("18446744073709551615"));
	}
Which will print, when executed,
	22
	21
	20	(the "pure string" length)
[*] Depending on what the original author wanted.
