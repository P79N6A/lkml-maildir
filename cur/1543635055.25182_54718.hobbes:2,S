A question for all you out there. Is there any way to get the Intel 
PRO/Wireless 5000 pcmcia cards working?
(that are those new 54 Mbs 801.11a pcmcia cards)
I've got a couple here playing very non alive and non detected under linux.
ps, lspci -v reports it as:
09:00.0 Ethernet controller: Unknown device 168c:0007 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 2500
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 10
        Memory at f2800000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
        Capabilities: [44] Power Management version 2
Any info is greatly apreciated
