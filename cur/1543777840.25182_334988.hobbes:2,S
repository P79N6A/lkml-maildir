Subject: Noob question. Why is the for-pentium4 kernel built with -march=i686 ?

Hello,
If I set the CPU type to be amd64 in kernel config, the kernel is built
with -march=k8. If I set it to be k6, the kernel is built with
-march=k6. If I set the CPU type to be Pentium4, the kernel is built
with -march=i686 -mtune=pentium4. Why is not the for-P4 kernel built
with -march=pentium4 ? 
I tried building the kernel with -march=pentium4  for the sake of
experiment and got no ill effects.
Thanks,
Ivan Yosifov.
