Hi Linux gurus,
I would like to point out a bug in the Linux TCP implementation which only
appears with multithreaded applications. If a thread is doing a select() on
a file descriptor which is a socket in LISTEN state, and another thread is
closing the file descriptor, then select() does not return (with EBADF set).
My guess is that in tcp_close() for the special case state == TCP_LISTEN,
there is no call to sk->state_change(sk) before it is marked as dead.
Of course, this is just for the case of multithreaded apps, since select()
checks for fd validity on entry...
Best regards,
-Eric
