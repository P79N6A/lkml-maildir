Turning on I/O and memory decoding at the wrong time can be bad, too. 
The BIOS might have disabled certain regions for a reason.
But you're right...  :)  as soon as I sent the patch, I decided
PCI_PR_ENABLE_IO and PCI_PR_NO_ENABLE_MEM flags were needed, to do the
PCI_COMMAND jazz.  (The naming of the flags reflects my opinion that it
is ok to enable mem by default, but not ok to enable I/O decoding by
default)

Thanks for looking over it.
