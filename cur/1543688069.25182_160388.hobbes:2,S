Hi, 
I just updated $other machine to 2.4.22, and now i have several ACPI
tools screaming at me because /proc/acpi dosn't exist.
(it was running 2.4.21-pre1, it has aslo been running with several acpi
patches)
And then:
dmesg |grep ACPI
 BIOS-e820: 0000000027fec000 - 0000000027fef000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000027fff000 - 0000000028000000 (ACPI NVS)
ACPI: have wakeup address 0xc0001000
ACPI disabled because your bios is from 2000 and too old <- WTF?
ACPI: RSDP (v000 ASUS                                      ) @

ACPI: Subsystem revision 20030813
ACPI: Interpreter disabled.
PCI: ACPI tables contain no PCI IRQ routing entries
I assure you that this machine has been running with acpi enabled for
years without a problem. The latest bios is from "2000/08/04" according
to asus' website.
Is it me or is this check unwarranted? Or does it actually catch bad
bisoses?
PS. Keep me in the CC:
DS.
