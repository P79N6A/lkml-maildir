With -mm we get those nice little automatic emails saying you've put
the patch into -mm, which removes one of the main reasons for wanting
to be able to get an up-to-date image of your tree.  The other reason,
of course, is to be able to see if a patch I'm about to send conflicts
with something you have already taken, and rebase it if necessary.
Paul.
