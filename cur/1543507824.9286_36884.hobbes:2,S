Subject: [PATCH] struct rlimit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

According to the Unix98 spec, struct rlimit should contain elements of
type rlim_t, and rlim_t should be an unsigned type.  There are also two
missing values: RLIM_SAVED_CUR and RLIM_SAVED_MAX.  Please apply to both
2.2 and 2.3.
