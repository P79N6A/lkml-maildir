same for me under 'vanilla' 2.6.0-test1.
However, giving 'psmouse_noext' as kernel param helped for me to make
the touchpad work (using /dev/input/mice (protocol autops2) as source
for gpm and gpm repeater as source for x, as I did in 2.4.x kernels).
Setting "#define DEBUG" in drivers/input/serio/i8042.c caused lots of
lines of text on my console whenever i touched either the touchpad or
one of the (four) buttons.
with 'psmouse_noext' it creates less lines on my console, and only for
two buttons, not for the other two.
HTH,
Michael
