No signal is sent. We tell affected processes that they have a signal pending, 
and capture them in the signal handling code while the suspend to ram is 
occuring. After the suspend to ram is finished, we recalculate whether they 
have a signal pending, and let them continue.
Not being a guru on signal handling itself, I won't try to answer the question 
itself :\.
