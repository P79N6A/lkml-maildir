OK, so all of this flaming, and digging up of "licenses ripped off",
and chaff thrown up in the air, and moaning and bewailing about
"theft", is now down to these two lines regarding Nick and Jiri:

It's under a BSD license; what material difference does those two
lines make, for goodness sake?  It's under a BSD license, so it's not
like anything won't be "given back".  Whether or not they have made
enough for changes is really a question for the lawyers, and may
differ from one jurisdiction to another --- but whether or not they
have now, or maybe will not make until later --- does it really make a
difference?  Who gets hurt if someone gets they get a bit more credit
than they deserve?  Certainly the most important thing is that Reyk is
given proper credit, right?
