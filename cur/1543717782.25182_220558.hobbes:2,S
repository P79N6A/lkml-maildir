OK, I created cryptoapi@lists.logix.cz mailing list.
It is mailman-driven, i.e. subscribe with an empty mail to
cryptoapi-subscribe@lists.logix.cz or through the web page
http://lists.logix.cz/mailman/listinfo/cryptoapi
All cryptography-in-the-kernel discussions are on-topic.
I hope to see you there ;-)
