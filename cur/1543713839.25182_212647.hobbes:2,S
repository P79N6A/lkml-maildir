Ok.. I'll check that link, but what you posted didn't have the files
(mempolicy.h & policy.c) in the patch:
[mcd@arrakis numa_api]$ diffstat numa_api-01-core.patch

Maybe it got lost somewhere between your mailer and mine?  The patch you
posted to LKML yesterday was clearly done without the -N option to diff:
diff -u linux-2.6.5-numa/kernel/sys.c-o linux-2.6.5-numa/kernel/sys.c

I don't know why.  The same code addition is in both the 'core' patch
and the 'shm' patch.  Adding it twice causes patch throw a reject.

Well, if for no other reason than all the code isn't posted!
