it's nice to know i'm not the only one with ess problems.
i contacted the driver author some time  ago with this same problem
and the same fix was made.  supposely a patch was sent to alan...
but what i'm more interested in is if there were any other changes to
make this work for you.  i have a ess1888 and i haven't been able to
get it to work properly since moving over to 2.2.x nearly a year ago.
i got the slow sound problem fix, but my sound will dma timeout if
there are ANY hard drive reads while its playing.
the driver author informed me it might be a "slow" ide interface, but
i haven't been able to get any help with it...any clue?
thanks in advance,
herbert
