I too have been having lockups and have posted here, with Penguin, 
and with the redhat-list.  
The machines are 2 Penguin dual PIII (network or load related), 
and a Dell WS400 dual PII/300 (sound active then access the floppy).

Same.  The Dell has the kdb code (from SGI) and I can't access that
either.

I saw some unexpected interrupts from the floppy drive, but it had
not locked up at that time -- it locked up later....

Since I have 3 systems doing it, others have also reported similar,
I think it could be kernel related....
