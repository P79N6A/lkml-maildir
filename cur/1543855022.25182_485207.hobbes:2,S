The /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is 0 (the default is 0, no ?)
This is test program, memstress.c. We make sure we touch all allocated chunks.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <poll.h>
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char *p;
    int size = 10*1024*1024;
    int k;
    int bypass_prompt = 0;
    int mb = 0;
    int bytes = 0;
    printf("Warning this allocation test may kill your computer by
exhausting the swap+memory\n");
    if( argc > 1 && 0 == strcmp("-f", argv[1])) {
        bypass_prompt = 1;
    }
    if(!bypass_prompt) {
        printf("Press Enter to proceed, or Ctrl-C to cancel; or use -f
option to bypass the prompt\n");
        getchar();
    }
    for(k=0; ; k++)  {
        p = malloc(size);
        if(p) {
            memset(p, 0xff, size );
            bytes += size;
            printf("%d mb\n", bytes / (1024*1024) );
        }
        poll(0,0, 1);
    }
}
