The stacktrace is
  __might_sleep()
  lock_page()
  handle_mm_fault()
  do_page_fault()
  error_code
So yes, handle_mm_fault() is called. But I assume that down_read_trylock()
succeeded before we were forced to call down_read().

The reason is that our code expects that to ensure syncing of the CPU
state with the saved state. I fear it is quite difficult to change that...
Kind regards,
