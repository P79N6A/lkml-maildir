No ! You may feel better stopping user processes (and actuallty you
may require that for swsusp, I don't know) but the whole PM scheme is
designed to make that unnecessary. I do NOT stop user processes on
suspend-to-RAM on PowerMacs, I don't think neither APM nor ACPI need
that (I may be wrong here, but if that is the case, then some drivers
need fixing).
