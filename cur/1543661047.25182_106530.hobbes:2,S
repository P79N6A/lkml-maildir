No it's:
 	t1 = rw->pre_sequence
 	t2 = rw->post_sequence
 	t1 += 1;
 	t2 += 2;
 	rw->pre_sequence = t1
 	wmb()
 	xtimensec = xtime.tv_nsec
 	wmb()
 	rw->post_sequence = t2
you're missing xtimensec is a write.
or this if you prefer:
	spin_lock() / now xtime can't change under us
 	t1 = rw->pre_sequence
 	t2 = rw->post_sequence
	t3 = xtime.tv_nsec
 	t1 += 1;
 	t2 += 2;
 	rw->pre_sequence = t1
 	wmb()
 	xtimensec = t3
 	wmb()
 	rw->post_sequence = t2
	spin_unlock() / now xtime can change again
and the above is the optimal implementation of the write-side. We
definitely don't want to forbid those reoderings. if gcc or cpu thinks
it's worthwhile they must be allowed to optimize it since it's legal.
I believe wmb() is correct, and mb() is overkill.
