Hi Mauro,
[As a side note, it looks like there have been some distribution
problems with this patchset... I can only see 0/31 (twice) on LKML and
11/31 didn't make it to the lm-sensors list as it was supposed to. I
received it twice though.]

Unrelated changes, this should have been two separate patches. Also,
"I2C driver ID" would better describe what the second change is about
than "I2C code".

That's a poor ID name you chose. The second "I2C" is totally redundant,
and "IR" is a bit short and could mean about anything. Please change it to
I2C_DRIVERID_IRKBD or I2C_DRIVERID_INFRARED or something.
Thanks,
