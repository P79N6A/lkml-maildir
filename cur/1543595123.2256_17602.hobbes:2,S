Thanks folks, I got some great comments, pointers a
list of problems which I need to take care of.
I promise that when I try and implement user
level interrupts - it won't be a hack, all problems
will be taken  care of based on good programming
practices.
I will look into the steps provided by people.
Yes! we need to worry about shared interrupts, I will
draw out a more detailed plan of problems and
solutions.
Later ...
Thanks,
Balbir
