OK. That solves the problem. BTW, s/regular file/non-directory/. Well,
right now I'm *really* low on caffeine, so I'm going down. I'll probably
finish the thing this evening/next night. I really think that separating
silly_rename() is the Right Thing, but it may wait till 2.3.
Another thing: what do you think about FIFO handling in struct inode?
union {
	struct foo a;
	struct bar {
		int data[BIGGER_THAN_FOO_AND_UNUSED_IF_A_IS_USED];
		...
	} b;
	struct baz {
		struct foo fake;
		...
	} c;
	struct quux {
		struct foo fake;
		...
	} d;
	struct fred {
		struct foo fake;
		...
	} e;
	...
}
doesn't look like correct C for me. And it's exactly what we have in union
within struct inode. foo==pipe_inode_info. Comments? I'ld allocate
pipe_inode_info separately and keep the pointer outside of struct inode.
I've sent a patch somewhere around 2.2.0-pre*... It's about 6K, mostly
removal of fake pipe_inode_info from places where it doesn't belong. It
works here since the end of December, so... BTW, it even doesn't break
binary compatibility - pointer is added to the end of struct inode and
size of pipe_inode_info is smaller than ext2_inode_info, thus the union
size didn't change. Up to you...
