Hmmm...  A better comment might be something like "Awaken the
corresponding synchronize_rcu() instance now that a grace period has
completed".  Given that the underlying RCU implementation provides
callbacks, synchronize_rcu() will need some sort of callback function.
So, the question is whether "complete()" can be that callback function.
As near as I can tell, the answer is "no", because the RCU callback
function always gets a pointer to a struct rcu_head, which would not
make much sense to the "complete()" function.
In short, I believe that wakeme_after_rcu() needs to stick around.
A better comment for wakeme_after_rcu() would be good, perhaps as shown below.
						Thanx, Paul
