   That breaks objects which have other __section__(".data.exit") info
   which is not marked const.  I put a comment just above that change...
Then change the other definition of that macro to
_NOT_ be const, and then fixup each and every driver
to drop the const directive in their table declaration.
As it stands the two version of that macro are totally
inconsistent.
