you have to keep it associated with the filesystem, though.  what if you
have a bunch of ext3 partitions on a bunch of partitions, are you going to
have /proc/dev/hda1, /proc/dev/sda3, /proc/tmp/loop_back.img??
couldn't you just make a new flag for the inode that journal.dat uses?  i'm
guessing using S_IMMUTABLE will cause some problems, but something similar
to that?
