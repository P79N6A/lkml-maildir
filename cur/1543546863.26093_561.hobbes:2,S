A bit of both - the driver shouldn't accept the irq=N parameter if it has
no intention of using it.  (see following patch against 2.2.17-pre20).
Then you would have got an error message immediately telling you what 
is wrong.

The general rule is that EEPROM configuration stuff should be in a user 
space tool and not in a driver. (e.g. see wdsetup.c and 3c5x9setup.c)
There is interest in your fix but not for the driver.  Take an existing
config program like that for the 3c509, (saves you rewriting all the 
getopt() cruft etc etc) cut the guts out of it and glue your code into it, 
while adding code to change the i/o base and AUI/BNC/UTP port.
Paul.
