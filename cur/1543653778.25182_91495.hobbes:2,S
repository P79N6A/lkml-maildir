Some (not all) of the inlined functions are 'inline' to accelerate the
kernel.
Perhaps, though, the inlined functions should be declared:
   #ifdef __GNUC__
   #  define INLINE extern inline
   #else
   #  define INLINE inline
   #endif
   #ifdef GPL
   INLINE type function (arguments)
   {
      ...
   }
   #else
   INLINE type function (arguments);
   #endif
This would be neat in that no real additional code would be brought into
the module, however, there is a possibility that the module would run a little
bit slower - a small incentive to GPL the module...
Of course, this would mean that any #define's still sitting around that
contributed code of significance should be replaced with possibly inlined
functions...
Would this make everybody happy?
