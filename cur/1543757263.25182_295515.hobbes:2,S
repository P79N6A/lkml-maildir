as long as it stays on a single CPU, could we allow softirq contexts to
preempt each other? I.e. we'd keep the per-CPU assumption (that is fair
and needed for performance anyway), but we'd allow NET_TX to preempt
NET_RX and vice versa. Would this corrupt the rx/tx queues? (i suspect
it would.)
(anyway, by adding an explicit no-preempt section around the 'take
current rx queue private, then process it' on PREEMPT_RT it could be
made safe. I'm wondering whether there are any other deeper assumptions
about atomic separation of softirq contexts.)
