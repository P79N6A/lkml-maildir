Kernel needs to only worry about the updates that it does.  So, if
kernel is writing into a page that is getting marked with execute
permission then it will need to make sure that caches are coherent.
ia64 Kernel keeps track of whether it has done any write operation on a
page or not using PG_arch_1.  And accordingly flushes icaches.

You mean by user space? If so, then it is user space responsibility to
do the appropriate operations (like flush icache in this case).
