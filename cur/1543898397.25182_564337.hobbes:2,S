Yes, I have a good case, but my case may not sound interesting until you 
see it working.
Ok, I am developing a dynamic memory allocation routine which takes 
direct advantage of the ability of a machine to use Virtual Memory to 
make everything look contiguous and fast.
And it just doesn't make sens to have mmap() map ANONYMOUS shared memory 
and mremap() not to expand it and make the expanded area available.
I am not a 100% sure, but I don't think correcting its behavior would 
cause a problem.
Would you happen to know how I can work around that issue for now, and 
make writing in an expended area not to generate a Bus error?
Sincerely,
William Tambe
