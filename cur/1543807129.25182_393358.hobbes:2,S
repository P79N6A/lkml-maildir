Yes, it is, where do you think udev gets it's information from?  That's 
right, from /sys.  Sysfs is the kernel interface, not udev; the 'u' in 
udev is for 'user', as in NOT part of the kernel.

Bullshit yourself.  If cdrecord is the only application for burning cds, 
that does not make it the kernel interface for cds, and certainly does 
not make it part of the kernel.  The kernel interface is the point of 
interaction between user and kernel code, which is sysfs.
Udev and HAL are two user mode ( NOT parts of the kernel ) components 
built to put the information from sysfs to use in user space, and other 
applications are encouraged to utilize the services those daemons 
provide.  By no stretch of the imagination does that make them part of 
the kernel.
