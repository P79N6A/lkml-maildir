No. They ARE REFERRED EXACTLY the same way some other devices are.
/dev/hdd here is Zip drive (and I'm could check it with fdisk :-) and
/dev/hdd4 (usually) is fourth partition there with actual data. It's
possible to use /dev/hdd as disk (just use mkfs.<filesystemtype> :-)
but this way Zip disk will be unusable for DOS and/or Windows even if
there are will be used msdos of vfat filesystem...

You Zip drive is /dev/hda . Really. /dev/hda4 is just partition on that
drive :-)
