This is OK for a game or mplayer but this is not 100% reliable, we need
to know if we missed an interrupt or didn't get scheduled in time.  If
it were there would be no such thing as an xrun.  For serious audio work
we want an xrun to be a fatal error.
For 2.6 it looks like sched_clock, the HPET, and maybe the PM timer may
do what we want, if the syscall overhead is tolerable.
