Hi.  Have you tried only PATAPI DVD-RAM drives?  Only via ide-cd.o, 
rather than via ide-scsi.o?
Me, as yet I have no PATAPI DVD-RAM, so instead I tried a USB DVD-RAM 
drive, specifically the "HL-DT-ST" "DVDRAM" "A100" drive.
Agreed, 2.4.27-rc4 fails to write.  But for me, 2.4.26 also fails to 
write.
For USB DVD-RAM in 2.4, I think the root evil is the dmesg complaint 
"kernel: sr0: scsi-1 drive", which in turn arises from the host 
substituting vendor-specific op x1A for MMC op x5A "MODE SENSE (10)".  
I'm guessing PATAPI DVD-RAM breaks over some other issue, found in the 
drivers/ide/ide-cd.c of ide-cd.o rather than in drivers/scsi/sr.c of 
ide-scsi.o.
