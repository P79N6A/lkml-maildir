Yes. Consider returning 0 for C/H/S in HDIO_GETGEO.
We need the BLKGETSTART ioctl for another reason:
the field start of a struct hd_geometry has 32 bits
and fails for partitions starting past the 2TB mark.
So, just like BLKGETSIZE64, this BLKGETSTART must
return a u64 and return an offset in bytes.
As we all know, geometry is meaningless for IDE.
But it is not for MFM/RLL and similar ancient stuff.
If support for old disks is not broken yet, try not to break it.
