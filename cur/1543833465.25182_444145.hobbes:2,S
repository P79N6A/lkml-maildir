Thanks for testing.

Yes, investigating this for real is something I will address
soon.  Don't worry :)

I'll check it out.

Two things are happening here.
1) The su ports are actually for the keyboard and mouse.
   I don't register them with the serial layer anymore for
   simplicity, and also because if they are driving the
   keyboard and mouse we really don't want people openning
   them as serial devices.
   I should probably add a little kernel log message for
   them, nevertheless.  I'll make that change right now.
2) I think the serial layer is confused about that ttyS1 thing.
   Take a look under /sys/class/tty/.  I bet there is a ttyS0
   directory, and underneath the "device" symlink points
   properly to your SAB82532 device node.
   If this is the case, it is using ttyS0 and ttyS1 is just
   an anomaly in how the serial core layer reports things.
   I've run into other problems in this area, so I know
   where to look to try and rectify things.
Thanks for the report!
