The built-in IDE controller on the Astro/Elroy based PA-RISC workstations
(B1000, C3000, J5000 and similar) is part of a NS87560 chip.  By default
(and we don't currently touch this), we route the internal interrupts
to Linux interrupts 14 and 15.  We could change that, but I don't currently
see a need to, since we're "the same as x86".  It uses the ns87415 driver.
I don't know what the situation is with the zx1-based boxes, currently only
the C8000.  If it's the same as the ia64 zx1 boxes, it'll have a CMD 649.

to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
