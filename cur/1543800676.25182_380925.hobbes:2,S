Subject: [patch 00/19] mutex subsystem, -V12

this is version -V12 of the generic mutex subsystem, against v2.6.15.
It consists of the following 19 patches:
  add-atomic-xchg.patch
  add-function-typecheck.patch
  mutex-generic-asm-implementations.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-i386.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-x86_64.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-arm.patch
  mutex-arch-mutex-h.patch
  mutex-core.patch
  mutex-docs.patch
  mutex-debug.patch
  mutex-debug-more.patch
  sem2mutex-xfs.patch
  sem2mutex-vfs-i-sem.patch
  sem2mutex-vfs-i-sem-more.patch
  sem2mutex-simple-ones.patch
  sem2completion-sx8.patch
  sem2completion-cpu5wdt.patch
  sem2completion-ide-gendev.patch
  sem2completion-loop.patch
the patches should work fine on every Linux architecture. They can also 
be downloaded from:

Changes since -V11:
  2 files changed, 50 insertions(+), 138 deletions(-)
- removed asm/semaphore.h from sx8.c (noticed by Nick Piggin)
- simplified the mutex locking slowpath, and merged the interruptible 
  and non-interruptible variants. This also fixes a small 
  queueing-fairness bug noticed by David Howells: tasks woken up by some 
  _other_ waitqueue might jump the wait-queue in the previous code, and 
  create unfairness. In this queueing variant we keep the task queued 
  all the time - if it retries it simply stays at the head of the queue.  
  This should also be more efficient. mutex.o got 10% smaller as well, 
  as the result of the unification of logic.
- cleanup: removed smaller inlined-once functions and merged them into 
  their usage sites.
