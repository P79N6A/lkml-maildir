That's because IDE doesn't allow multiple requests on the same bus, unlike
SCSI.  That's why IDE disks on the same bus are "master" and "slave".  If
you look at the 3ware IDE RAID systems, each drive has its own IDE bus.
Maybe try a stripe set on only two disks, hde and hdg, and see how it works.
Cheers, Andreas
