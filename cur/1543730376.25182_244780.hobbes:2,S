Then you can't dynamically regsiter an xattr handler (e.g. as a module).  
Is this really desirable?

Removing the prefix would imply that this was the 'proper' way to
implement xattr support.  Really, these are just helper functions for the 
simplest xattr implementations.  I think they should have some prefix, but 
don't care too much what it actually is.  Suggestions?
