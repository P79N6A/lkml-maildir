Using the 'pentiumpro' setting might open up a real can of worms depending on
the version of gcc/egcs you are using. I think the latest snapshots are safe
but I remember hearing about odd problems as a result of using the 'pentiumpro'
setting overall.
Someone that knows better please correct me if I'm wrong but I'd suggest
not using it as a way to track down problems.. it might just introduce new
ones.
