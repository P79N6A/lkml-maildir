The user-mode port of 2.4.0-test6 is available.
It's been updated to 2.4.0-test6.
The major change in this release is the addition of a clever piece of code 
from Lars Brinkhoff which allows gdb to debug kernel threads without having to 
attach to them.  It is possible to attach gdb to the kernel once it's up, and 
also to start the kernel under the control of gdb by putting 'debug' on the 
command line.
This release is also very unstable.  I've updated only the patch so that 
people can play with it and hopefully find more informative crashes than I've 
been able to get so far.  The debugging interface will come in handy here.  
Put 'debug' on the command line, tell gdb to set it running, and when you get 
a panic, ^C it and get a backtrace and do all the standard post-mortem stuff.  
You can also set breakpoints and step through the code, but adding conditions 
and commands to breakpoints causes crashes, and 'next' and 'step' sometimes 
act as 'cont'.
The project's home page is 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
 and has been 
completely revamped with lots of new information.
