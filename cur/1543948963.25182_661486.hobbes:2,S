please talk in your own name. Stop-machine is a very elegant tool that 
simplifies a lot of hard things in the kernel and is reasonably fast as 
well. We've just recently added two new usages of it and more are 
planned.
_you_ might be the one who wants to 'reduce the usage of stop_machine' - 
but that means it is _you_ who first has to convert a number of very 
difficult pieces of code to "something else".
