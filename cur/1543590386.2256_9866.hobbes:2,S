There are issues with error detection/correction/recovery with
different designs of L1 and L2 caches. There's a good paper:
    IBM S/390 storage hierarchy - G5 and G6 performance considerations
    IBM Journal of Research and Development
    Vol 43 No. 5/6
available at
    
http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/435/jackson.html
which covers IBM's choice of L1 and L2 design for S/390. The section on
"S/390 reliability and performance implications" is relevant here. In
particular, they use a solution which isn't best from the performance
point of view but ensures you don't discover "too late" about an error.
I heard a rumour (now I get to the unsubstantiated part :-) that Sun
chose a higher-performing design for their cache subsystem but which has
a nastier failure mode in the case of cache errors.
