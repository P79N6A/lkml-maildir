Unexpected - let's see if we can nail it down then.
Can you please try to edit the line above to include only one of the -f
options and see if that helps. make V=1 may help to identify if the flag
are picked up or not.
Also could you try executing:
if gcc -fno-stack-protector-all -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null; then \
  echo "y"; else echo "n"; fi
And see if this gives a "y" or a "n".
Try with -fno-stack-protector-all and with -fno-stack-protector.
