gcc 3.3 is relatively new and _much_ less tested than 2.95. A new gcc 
might either contain bugs or it might unleash bugs in the kernel that 
weren't visible before (e.g. via better optimizations).
Usually gcc 3.3 works fine (and my PC at home runs a 2.4.21 compiled
with 3.3) but if you want stability in production envvironments 2.95 (or
the unofficial 2.96 >= 2.96-74) is the recommended compiler.
