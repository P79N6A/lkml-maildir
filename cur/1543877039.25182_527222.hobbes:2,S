No, I'm not missing the point, I was the first to say here that such
code has been there forever and in turn I'm worried about apps
depending on it for all the wrong reasons, I even went as far as
asking a counter to avoid the waste to go unniticed, and last but not
the least that's why I'm not discussing this as internal suse fix for
the scalability issue, but only as a malinline patch for -mm.
