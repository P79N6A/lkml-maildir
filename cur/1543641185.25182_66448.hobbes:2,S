Hello,
I am running and will in near future kernel 2.4.18 on an embedded system.
I have to speed up interrupt latency and need to understand how in what
timing tasklets are called and arbitraded.
I have to dig deep, but the kernel tree is quiet huge. As a non kernel
programmer I ask you, if anyone could give me a hint, where to start reading
from and which kernel source to pick first.
Any help highly appreaciated. 
(BTW: I will not bother you personaly with further questions unless you give
permission.)
What's behind it: We patched NMI and do some stuff we have to do very
regularly in there. After NMI we have to quiet fast start a kernel or even a
user space function with low latency. Also I measured 8 milliseconds after a
hardware interrupt before the corresponding interrupt function is called. At
RTI time it is even longer (around 12 microseconds). Need to find a way to
exactly understand why, and maybe speed up a bit.
Thank You.
Siegfried.
