Well we can certainly do some of that if ACPI is present and active. In
particular since _GTM will give us current modes allowing for hotplug and
post BIOS boot kexec etc it ought to be safe to do Tejun's hack that way.
We could even probe UDMA3+ capable devices by doing _STM to a high mode
and _GTM to determine the cable type 8)
