That's the one.

There isn't anything in the stock kernel that will let you do this
without some form of patches being applied.

telnet (and its associated protocol) is a completely different beast to
serial consoles - in fact any network connection is.
If you really want to get at the kernel message data, there's dmesg
or a simple cat /proc/kmsg.  The problem with these is, when the kernel
crashes, you won't get the last messages.  Also, if you're generating
more than 16K of messages before allowing the kernel to continue (and
thus user space) you're also going to loose messages.
