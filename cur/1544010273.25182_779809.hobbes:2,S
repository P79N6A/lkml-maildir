Good.

So much for constructive critisism.. have you tried taking the design to
its limits, if so, where do you see problems?
I read the above as: I invested a lot of time in something of dubious
statue (out of tree patch), and now expect it to be merged because I
have invested in it.

Process, as in single thread, or multi-threaded? I'll assume
single-thread.

Yes, afaict it can.
You can group counters in v3, a read out of such a group will be an
atomic read out and provide vectored output that contains all the data
in one stream.

Gosh, what does one expect from something that is hardly a week old..

I'll argue to disagree, sure such events might not be supported by any
particular hardware implementation - but the fact that PAPI gives a list
of 'common' events means that they are, well, common. So unifying them
between those archs that do implement them seems like a sane choice, no?
For those archs that do not support it, it will just fail to open. No
harm done.
The proposal allows for you to specify raw hardware events, so you can
just totally ignore this part of the abstraction.
