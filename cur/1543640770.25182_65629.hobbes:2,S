This can be done with counting repeat count of the last key until we
reach the pause (done with a timer, that gets modified after each
key pressed).
If the pause is reached or after each key press you compute the
keycode character that will be sent now.
Cell phones usally do an replacement of the character until you
do the pause or push a different key.
So you would need to play console games, too (changing between
insert and replace mode).
Hope this helps.
