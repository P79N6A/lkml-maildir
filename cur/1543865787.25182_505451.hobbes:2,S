As Joel mentioned earlier, from an Oracle perspective, one of the key 
things we are looking for is a nice clean *common* wait point. We don't 
really care whether this common wait point is the old libaio:async-poll, 
epoll, or "wait_for_async". And if "wait_for_async" has the added 
benefit of scaling, all the better.
However, it is desirable for that common wait-routine to have the 
ability to return explicit completions, instead of requiring a follow-on 
call to some other query/wait for events/completions for each of the 
different type of async submissions done (poll, pid, i/o, ...). 
Obviously not a "must-have", but desirable.
It is also desirable (if possible) to have immediate completions (either 
immediate errs or async submissions that complete synchronously) 
communicated at submission time, instead of via the common wait-routine.
Finally, it is agreed that neg-errno is a much better approach for the 
return code. The threading/concurrency issues associated w/ the current 
unix errno has always been buggy area for Oracle Networking code.
