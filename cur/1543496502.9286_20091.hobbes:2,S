Hi,
I found out your rename change in kernel 2.2.6-2.2.9 broke loopback
device. The problem is randoum. I have to run a script, which uses
the loopback device, for 80 times to reproduce the bug. At 10 minutes
each, it takes almost 13 hours to reproduce it. When the bug shows
up, I get the kernel messages like:
EXT2-fs error (device loop(7,0)): ext2_add_entry: bad entry in directory #12: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0
EXT2-fs error (device loop(7,0)): ext2_add_entry: bad entry in directory #12: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0
EXT2-fs error (device loop(7,0)): ext2_add_entry: bad entry in directory #12: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0
or
file_cluster badly computed!!! 2989 <> 1949
file_cluster badly computed!!! 2990 <> 1950
file_cluster badly computed!!! 2991 <> 1951
file_cluster badly computed!!! 2992 <> 1952
file_cluster badly computed!!! 2993 <> 1953
Do you have any ideas? Does you patch take loopback into account?
Thanks.
H.J.
