  has there been a change in the last few days involving whether the
kernel option CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO appends the first part of $(git
rev-parse HEAD) to the kernel uname?
  i could have *sworn* that, only a few days ago, i could configure
and build a new kernel with a uname release of something like
"2.6.19-rday-ge0f1..."  now, though, all i get is "2.6.19-rday".  and
that affects the installed /lib/modules/ directory name as well.
  am i just hallucinating again?
