Subject: fakephp problem in 2.6.22 (and 2.6.21)

Dear Linux PCI,
Kernel Version(s): 2.6.22 (Ubuntu 7.10) and 2.6.21 (Fedora Core 7)
I am trying to use fakephp to rescan the PCI bus when I reload my PCI Interface FPGA.
When I reload the FPGA, lspci shows "[disabled]" for the original Base Address Regions. My hope is that a rescan will re-enumerate the bus and fill in the PCI Settings on the FPGA interface. In fact, I can use setpci to re-enable the board after loading FPGA, but only if I have not changed any of the core parameters. I would hope that a rescan would read the possibly changed core parameters and reallocate memory as needed.
fakephp is loaded in to the kernel using "modprobe fakephp debug=1" as advised in order to get debug information in dmesg.
dmesg indicates fakephp is installed
fakephp: Fake PCI Hot Plug Controller Driver
fakephp: slot->name = 0000:00:00.0
...
fakephp: slot->name = 0000:03:00.0
fakephp: slot->name = 0000:06:03.0
my FPGA board is connected via PCI Express to bus 3 so I issue the following command
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/slots/0000\:03\:00.0/power
-bash: echo: write error: No such device
lspci still shows that the BAR on 03:0.0 are still disabled, and dmesg gives no other indications.
writing a 1 to any other device/slot seems to have no effect.
writing a 0 to this power file causes the terminal to hang, but something does happen in dmesg.
echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/slots/0000\:03\:00.0/power ***TERMINAL HANG***
(open another terminal)
last few lines of dmesg 
fakephp: disable_slot - physical_slot = 0000:03:00.0
fakephp: No device in slot found
fakephp: No device in slot found
fakephp: No device in slot found
fakephp: No device in slot found
fakephp: No device in slot found
fakephp: No device in slot found
fakephp: No device in slot found
fakephp: removing slot 0000:03:00.0
Now echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/slots/0000\:03\:00.0/power ***TERMINAL HANG***
(open another terminal)
no change in dmesg
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/slots/0000\:06\:03.0/power
-bash: echo: write error: No such device
now dmesg has a lot of detail:
fakephp: New device on PCI Bus #03 function 0:0
fakephp: slot->name = 0000:03:00.0
kobject_add failed for 0000:03:00.0 with -EEXIST, don't try to register things with the same name in the same directory.

 =======================
pci_hotplug: Unable to register kobject<3>fakephp: pci_hp_register failed with error -22
lspci still shows that my FPGA board BAR is "[disabled]"
Any advice would be appreciated.
