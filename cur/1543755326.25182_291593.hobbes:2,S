A lot of this scheduling policy work is going to have to be redone as
badly written apps start getting their crap together and as this patch
is more and more pervasive in the general Linux community. What's
happening now is only the beginning of things to come and it'll require
a solid sample application with even more hooks into the kernel before
we'll see the real benefits of this patch. SCHED_FIFO will have to do
until more development happens with QoS style policies.
