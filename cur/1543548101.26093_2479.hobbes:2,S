Note that whenever it's not GPL'd, all the module restrictions kick in. 
So it's going to be "legal" the same way any binary only module is
"legal" - assuming all the nasty requirements are met.  For something as
simple (from a conceptual standpoint, not necessarily an implementation
standpoint) as a network driver, doing that is not likely to be a big
problem. 
It obviously cannot be linked into the kernel, but as a loadable module
it's ok as long as it uses the standard interfaces and nothing more. 
And sure, having source available might make it easier for people to
help you: it can't become part of the standard kernel, and as such it
will never be supported, but that's true of binary-only modules too. 
I wouldn't recommend it, but I don't see that it would be an
insurmountable problem.
