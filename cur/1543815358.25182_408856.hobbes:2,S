Dear Linux developers,
I am student of Computer Sciences at University Carlos III of Madrid
(Spain). I worked before in a project related with the Linux kernel,
analyzing the integration of the parallel file system expand into the
Linux kernel.
Actually, I am developing LXD as my final year project. LXD, based on
the LXR project, intends to be a documentation system for large source
projects. Its main objective is to gather high level information that
cannot be extracted from the source files. LXD is registered at
SourceForge.net (
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lxd/
). A detailed
presentation for the LXD project can be found at
http://lxd.sourceforge.net/.
It is of my interest to analyze the user requirements for LXD. I will
appreciate very much any comment about LXD, especially those regarding
the expected system usage. There is a mailing list available at
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/lxd-devel
 for those
interested in discussing LXD capabilities.
Thank you for your time and regards,
--
Guillermo
