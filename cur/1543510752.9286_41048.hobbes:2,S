Hello-
I have the tulip driver in debug mode (insmod tulip debug=6). 
Previously (Linux 2.3.11 and prior), the messages came out in
/var/log/messages. Now they show up in multiple xterm sessions,
regardless of the UID of the user logged in.  So I get the same
messages in 4 windows at once. 
How do I control this / turn it off?
Linux 2.3.18ac8...
