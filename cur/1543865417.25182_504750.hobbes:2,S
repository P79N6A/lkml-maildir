it's simpler. You only move them off when you encounter them during a
scan. No walking early etc etc. Only do work when there is an actual
situation where you do scan.

Well.. That's the point! Only IF there is a reclaim scan do you move
them out again. The fact that these pages are on the list isn't a
problem. The fact that you keep encountering them over and over again
during *scanning* is. So Andrews suggestion makes them go away in the
situations that actually matter

who cares though.. just do it lazy.
