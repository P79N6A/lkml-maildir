I went back through the archive to make sure, and since I didn't
specify where I did the timed tests, those timing tests would have
been done on my /home partition, which is reiserfs v3.
Since I was using different partitions for ext3 and reiserfs on
/dev/hda, a direct comparison between ext3 and reiserfs wouldn't
be completely fair, but a "watching the paint dry" observation
seemed to indicate that reiserfs was significantly faster for this
load.  I did press my backup disk into service for this testing,
to eliminate the possibility that this was due to a finicky disk,
and I have a 3.9 G partition which I've formatted first reiserfs,
then ext3, so I could do some fair tests between reiserfs and
ext3 on that disk.  But I think the results are already known;
reiserfs opens a can of whoopass for this kind of load.
