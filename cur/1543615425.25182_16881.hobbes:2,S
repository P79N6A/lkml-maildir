|Quite honestly if you want a user built "update" kernel it should probably
|work out the critical stuff (CPU, memory size limit, SMP) set a few things
|to safe values, and build all the driver modules.
|
|Why ask the user at all. The boot process already knows what
|modules to load
|Instead you get
|
|	Checking...
|		This is an X86 platform
|		You have an AMD K6 processor
|		Your machine lacks SMP support
|		You have 256Mb of memory
|
|	I am building you a kernel for an AMD K6 series processor with
|	up to 1Gb of memory and no SMP. If you add more than 1Gb of memory
|	you will need to build a new kernel
This would break things like cross-compilation. Not sure how many people
use it though. You will have to be on the machine for which you intend
to compile the kernel. If you are compiling the kernel for the same machine
then it is the best thing to happen, provided the software doing the
configuration for u is not broken
