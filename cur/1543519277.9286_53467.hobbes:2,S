You don't need to do anything in the kernel to do this from user 
land, as you simply use the vm86() functions that allow you to call 
the BIOS in a V86 task. The lrmi stuff can be used for this, or you 
can also look at our Open Source Portability Manager library which 
can do this under multiple OS'es (Linux included). Our PM library is 
part of our MGL graphics library, and you can get it all from:

Note that our PM library interface is based heavily on the lrmi code 
written by Josh Vanderhoof (we submitted a number of bug fixes back 
to Josh along the way).
I do believe the latest Red Hat 6.x DDC monitor detection stuff is 
based on the lrmi code (initially it was based on our code, but they 
re-wrote it as our code is under an MPL like license and not GPL).
