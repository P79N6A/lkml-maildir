A crap, I completely forgot to check drivers/, and my default builds
don't contain many of them. My bad.
I'll do a full pass and review all references to the changed variables. So
far I've only noticed printk stuff, but I'm not done. There's a fair
amount lot of places where they're cast into ints instead of longs,
but that's a whole other ball of wax (and shouldn't cause regressions
like the printk ones could).
