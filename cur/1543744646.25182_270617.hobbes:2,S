That's definitely a good start.
It does need to be fixed to enforce the usual rules about
illegal combinations.  And his code is going to include
all sorts of weird things like VLAN offload which I wonder
if works correctly with the current bonding driver? :)
The two rules are codified in register_netdevice() as follows:
	/* Fix illegal SG+CSUM combinations. */
	if ((dev->features & NETIF_F_SG) &&
	    !(dev->features & (NETIF_F_IP_CSUM |
			       NETIF_F_NO_CSUM |
			       NETIF_F_HW_CSUM))) {
		printk("%s: Dropping NETIF_F_SG since no checksum feature.\n",
		       dev->name);
		dev->features &= ~NETIF_F_SG;
	}
	/* TSO requires that SG is present as well. */
	if ((dev->features & NETIF_F_TSO) &&
	    !(dev->features & NETIF_F_SG)) {
		printk("%s: Dropping NETIF_F_TSO since no SG feature.\n",
		       dev->name);
		dev->features &= ~NETIF_F_TSO;
	}
