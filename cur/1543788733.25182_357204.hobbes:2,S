Subject: error: implicit declaration of function 'cpu_die'

How can I fix this properly?
arch/ppc/kernel/idle.c includes linux/smp.h, which includes asm-smp.h
only if CONFIG_SMP is defined.
As a result, cpu_die remains undefined for non-SMP builds.
The include order was changed recently, as this kernel .config built ok with 2.6.13.
I see cpu_die was introduced recently in include/asm-ppc/smp.h, in 2.6.14-rc1.
