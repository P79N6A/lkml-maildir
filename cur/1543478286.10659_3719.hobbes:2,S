Right now I have no idea how this can happen. It means the transmitters is
stopped and the receiver still running. This shouldn't happen as the driver
always enables both transmitter and receiver. My theory is, that there is
a situation, where the chip turns of the transmitter, because of too many
failures (or whatever). But this isn't documented anywhere:-( and there is
no interrupt, when it happens. I have a patch, which checks in xmit_start()
whether the transmitter is still running and reinits the chip, if not. It
isn't a pretty workaround, but it seems to work (only tested by one person).
Thomas.

It's a host bridge, but it should be called ghost bridge instead ;^)
