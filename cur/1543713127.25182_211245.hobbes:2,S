Subject: [PATCH 2.6.5-rc3] enable compilation on hosts without elf.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

To compile linux, a host currently has to provide elf.h.
This patch adds elf.h from glibc-2.3.2 (with the inclusion of 
features.h removed), enabling compilation on hosts that don't provide 
it.
