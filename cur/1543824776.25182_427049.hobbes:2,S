Given that there are 60 fbdev drivers and only 7 DRM drivers. It sure
looks easier to me to declare the fbdev drivers as being the base
driver.  But if you want to spend the time needed to split up 60 fbdev
drivers, go ahead.
But one thing I do not want to see is only splitting the 7 fbdev
drivers that correspond to the DRM ones. The net effect of that will
be to create two different fbdev architectures. If you're going to
split fbdev you have to make the same split to all of them.
