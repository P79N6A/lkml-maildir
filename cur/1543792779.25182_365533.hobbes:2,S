Subject: [PATCH 00/15] mm: struct page lock and counts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here comes a batch of fifteen against 2.6.14-mm1.  The first eight tie
up various loose ends of the page fault scalability patches (but I've
not yet got to Documentation/vm/locking).  The last seven are about page
count overflow, resolving that issue made more immediate by refcounting
the ZERO_PAGE.  So I'd like to see these as 2.6.15 material: and mostly
the patches do apply to 2.6.14-git12; but there's two reiser4 patches I
separated out, an assumption that Andi's x86_64-page-flags-cleanup.patch
will go in ahead, and an obvious reject in vmscan.c.  You may see them
rather differently!  I think there could be two views on the overflow
patches: you might find them neat, you might find them too oblique; but
they do avoid extra tests in the hotter paths.  In some cases I've put
an additional comment below the --- cutoff.
