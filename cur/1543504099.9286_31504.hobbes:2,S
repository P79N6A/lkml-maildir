I don't really know, to be honest.  Last time I had to do this,
the options were 60ns and 70ns :)
I had a machine which would give random segfaults when building
large packages at 60ns, but which has been rock-solid at 70.
This doesn't, of course, mean that the memory's at fault - it could
be the cache, motherboard, PSU, cooling or any combination.
