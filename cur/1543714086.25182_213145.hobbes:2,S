This patch fixes the problem without moving and renaming huge amounts
of code. And the hook is still in place, so I don't see your problems.
If you look at the code - as seen in 2.4 and early 2.5 - that's (more
or less) the place where the fix should be.
Anyway, I don't really object against moving code around.
