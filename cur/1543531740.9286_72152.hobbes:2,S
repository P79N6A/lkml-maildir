Well, I tell you having 8395% (or is that 1/10 of what it was...) idle
time is great...
Seriously, I recompiled and am now running an Athlon kernel (800Mhz box
underneath).  You all have done a supreme job with 2.3.99pre3 and the
Athlon.  I only have one problem.  Cron keeps running cron.daily (RedHat
6.1 here) about every hour or two.  I do not know what to do about it. 
Is this a kernel problem (time from 'date' seems accurate enough)? is
this a Cron problem?  Is this a kernel<->userspace communication
problem?
