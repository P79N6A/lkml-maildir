Why don't you just rename your experimental
kernel something like "vmlinuz-exp" or similar
and put it in the /boot directory along with
the "normal" "vmlinuz". Then in lilo.conf
you put two options, one pointing to
the "normal" and one to the experimental
kernel.
You can also rename System.map in
System.map.orig and the experimental
System.map.exp and make a symlink
to the one you are planning to boot
at every reboot.
I use this metod to keep several
kernel versions in my linux box to
be able to choose the one I want
to play with.
Bye
