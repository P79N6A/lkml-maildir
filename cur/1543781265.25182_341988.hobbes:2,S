That's not a problem, they will work. But you should not use 2.4.25, but
rather 2.4.31 or even 2.4.32-preX, several security vulnerabilities and
bugs have been fixed since, and the code has not changed much, so most of
those patches still apply without a glitch.
You can also check in my tree, there are several updated patches + the glue
needed for them to apply correctly when needed, it may save you some time :
