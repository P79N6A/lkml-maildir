Because my intellectual capacity is limited, and it has little room left
for analyzing _multiple_ zone-lock-tracking sequences. It seems cleaner
to do this once, but as you put is elsewhere "it is a matter of personal
taste".
Besides, after I was recently subjected to looking at BSD kernel code, I
have morbid fear or any kind of mostly similar chunks of code
cut-n-pasted and then modified independently.
