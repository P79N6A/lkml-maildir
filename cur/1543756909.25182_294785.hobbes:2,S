Dear All,
How to get maximum output from dmesg command? 
I am unable to see all my debug messages after loading my driver. 
I think there is a restriction in displaying the dmesg output. 
I saw in printk.c file under source directory. There I found LOG_BUF_LEN
is 16384.
But I am unable to see not more that 300 to 400 lines of code from
dmesg. 
If I modify in the printk.c file then I get more lines of code from
dmesg command!!!
As var/log/messages is the source of dmesg command, I made a copy of
var/log/messages assuming that I will be getting the complete driver
trace in it. But a part of the messages that are at the initialization
of our driver are not seen. 
How can I get maximum lines of output from the dmesg command? 
I am using Red Hat 7.3 with 2.4.18-3 kernel version. 
Can anybody help in this regard?
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Srinivas G
