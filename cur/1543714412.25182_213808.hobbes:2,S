Hi Alex,
Nice comparison! The ext3 reservation system use more cpus because we do
reservations in memory( not on disk) and we have a global lock per
filesystem to guard the operation.  The current search for a new
reservation window algorithm is not perfect right now.  
extents and delayed allocation probably is the right way to go for next
generation (maybe ext4).  Currently I just try to fix the missing
preallocation feature in ext3, without break the disk compatibility and
involve too much changes....
Thanks for your interest.
