    Inside the kernel, it's a database, it's just the presentation
    layer that's different.
    No matter what, you'll still need the glue to maintain the database;
    fs/devfs/base.c is a bit large, but the bulk of it appears to be
    code that maintains the database and the changelog for v1-v123.
    And certainly you'll need the code in the drivers to register and
    unregister devices, which will look amazingly similar to the way
    devfs does it now (modulo the code that implements the useful,
    though not essential, new files that give absolute controller/
    unit/lun/partition access to devices.)

                   \/                              expensive codewise.
