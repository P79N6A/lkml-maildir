No; probing still takes place, but the results are ignored when mem=
is set. The problem with this motherboard was that calling int 0x15,
eax=0xe820 made the BIOS print "Out of memory" and halt the machine,
so specifying mem= doesn't help.
If the e820 call code in setup.S is only enabled when we're compiling
a 586+ kernel, we should be alright.
