Hi Dmitry,
That's the values I got *after* calibration. Before, because the
correction is set to a small signed value, it corrects wrongly and
report a random mix of signed and unsigned values when moving in one
direction...

At joydev_connect, the last parameter "input_dev" reports me that
range (dev->absmax[i] and dev->absmin[i]). When I turned on HID_DEBUG
it reported [0, 4096] for both axis 0 and 1, which is correct so it
must be between HID and joydev.
My point is that the auto-calibration could automagically solve all
range problems in all devices by zeroing the range and adapting the
ranges afterwards. If it can affect other devices as well as
joysticks, the calibration could happen in HID instead of joydev.
cheers,
