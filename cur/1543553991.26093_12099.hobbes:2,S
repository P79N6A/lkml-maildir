hi i need fast fpu in the kernel for my lexos work
so how am i going to do it on the i386
1 . can i add some save / restore code to the task swicher ( the right
way )
     so when it switchs from user to kernel task its saves the fpu state
?
2 . put the save / restore code in my code (NOT! GOOD! i do not wont to
do it this way it is not the right way)
so i have to use fpu in the kernel so its just how am i going to do it ?
thank you
