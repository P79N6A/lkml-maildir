I still don't quite agree. As long as the latency penalty of going
off node is not too bad (let's say < factor 2) i think it's better
to spread out the caches than to always locate them locally.
That is because kernel object/data cache accesses are far less frequent
than user mapped memory accesses. And it's a good idea to give
the later memory some headstart for local memory.
If you have a much worse worst case NUMA factor it might be different,
but even there it would be a good idea to at least spread it out
to nearby nodes.
