Erm... Or not-so-huge ones. Scenario: semaphore that should be grabbed in
VFS being grabbed by each fs driver. Race is found. Thing moves to VFS
(where it belongs) and now we should remove it from each fs in existance
(deadlocks). I'm afraid that no ABI will save in such situation. Yup, it's
not a pleasant thing to fix and nobody sane would do it just for fun -
there is a lot of filesystems in official tree, to start with.
Another thing: policy wrt exporting stuff. *Any* exported symbol is a
potential boat anchor.
