Going from 2.2.x to 2.4.x does nfs-utils from Red Hat 6.2 need to
be updated?  If so, does the 7.0 srpm build and install cleanly
in 6.2?  Can't seem to get nfs client to mount an NFS export from
a Red Hat 6.2 server...  ;o(  The server is running an official
kernel with no patches, not a Red Hat kernel.
