Fabio, I'm working on a similar solution, although I'm experimenting with 
SGI's KAIO patch to see what it can do. I've had to patch the kernel to 
implement POSIX style signal dispatch symantics (so that the thread which 
posted an I/O request doesn't have to be the one which catches the signal). 
Are you taking a similar approach, or is the lack of this behavior the 
reason you are using so many threads?
