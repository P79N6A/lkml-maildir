I cannot see any patch in this mail...
However, the patch linked there "indirectly",
http://www.spinnaker.de/linux/c1320/sata-resume-2.6.16.5.patch
applies well on vanilla 2.6.16 (although not on top of the "new EH"
patch) and is the first one that really works (as far as I tested it).
I tested it on a minimal kernel (no network no sound no nothing); I'll
build a new "non-minimal" kernel now :) If I run into any problems; I'll
tell you.
Thank you.
Michael
