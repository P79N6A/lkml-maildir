Looks like no one responded to you.  :(  But I think this would be very
cool.  Now we just gotta wait for those spiffy new K7/21264 motherboards
with the 200MHz main bus...drool...to come out, and then we can look at
trying to do this.  :)
I don't see why the loader (exec.c) couldn't be modified.  It can determine
the executable's architecture when you run any ELF binary, so it seems
reasonable that it could also schedule which processor it executes on.
This might do strange things to the SMP code.  In fact, it isn't even SMP
proper.  It's more like having two totally separate processors sharing a
memory space and devices.
