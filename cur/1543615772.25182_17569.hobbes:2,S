This is sort of what I was thinking, although it makes it more expensive
to determine to IPI mask. A very light weight alternative could be to
make only the highest priority RT tasks uninterruptible. If a CPU is
busy with one of these it can simply be taken out of the global group
for the duration. If a task is worried about interruptions, it can boost
its prio to max for the critical part and the return it to normal
afterwards.

I guess the worry is that the overhead isn't bounded and the per-CPU
overhead increases with the number of CPUs. If the interrupts happen
come in a burst, a running task can experience a longer interruption.

I see your point. I may be getting off base here, but how does the cost
of making the IPIs exact compare to the cost of using broadcast IPIs on
an n-way machine (depends on n I suppose)?
