(pretty easy to find out:)
[root]:# fsck -f /test
Parallelizing fsck version 1.19 (13-Jul-2000)
e2fsck 1.19, 13-Jul-2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
/lost+found not found.  Create<y>?
It created lost+found with inode 183 as 11 was used by renamed dir.
No idea if it would have trouble salvaging a corrupt fs after this.
(but logic says no it dare not)
