Excellent, thanks!
It turned out that the latencies are not caused by the kernel
messages themselves, but by sending them to a serial console
(which was off), in all my high latency cases at rtpri 89(99).
After removing the serial console from the boot parameters,
* the OOM timings are back to normal (around 50 microseconds)
* the USB error and remove timings are back to normal
* the USB plugin timings are in the range of the USB read
  (which is up to 1 ms - still bad)
However, latencies at rtprio 2 are still very frustrating
(details will follow).
