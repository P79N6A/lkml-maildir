I'm not sure this will work very well (2.4.0test8-pre1):
int do_fork(unsigned long clone_flags, unsigned long usp, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
	int retval = -ENOMEM;
	struct task_struct *p;
	DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED(sem);
	if (clone_flags & CLONE_PID) {
		/* This is only allowed from the boot up thread */
		if (current->pid)
			return -EPERM;
	}
So it would require fixing CLONE_PID first, which is probably nasty.
Without it it'll still require the context switches when you're calling
pthread_create from the "original" thread.
