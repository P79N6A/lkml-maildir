Alan... you have taken me wrong. What I mean is just the following.
Take away some minors from use by SCSI (or more propably a common repository)
and use the same ioctl numbers where possible. Perhaps implement
some ioctl here and there... not more!
Not the whole: "we are just another SCSI device on the driver level".
That would not make sense indeed. Since in esp. the SCSI mid-layer isn't
taht pritty too...
