At that point /dev/ram0 _is_ killed.

If you want to keep it until later (i.e. want to destiry it by hands)
mkdir /initrd on your final root and old one will be remounted there.
Again, "Trying to unmount old root ... okay" means that it already got

I wonder why does it get -EBUSY if you repeat it... Uh-oh...
Folks, who the hell is responsible for rd_inodes[] idiocy?
