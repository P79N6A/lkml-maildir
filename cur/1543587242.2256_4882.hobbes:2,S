	Proper place to do this discussion is linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
	The amount of traffic won't probably be very high in comparison
	to the average flow (150-250 emails per day at peak) of L-K.
	The more you split things around, the less the people who really
	need to follow it up can follow it.
	As this is free world, nothing prevents you from going ahead and
	creating some linux-25@xyz list somewhere.     Just don't expect
	everybody to rush into it.
