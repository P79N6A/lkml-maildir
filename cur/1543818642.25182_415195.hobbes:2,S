IANAL either.

Essential, not just a good idea. Just pick one who /does/ have a grasp of
GPL and like issues.

But AFAIU there is a fine line here... at least /in spirit/, adding system
calls and IOCTLs and... just for the particular use of a particular closed
source application is definitely wrong. It might be legally OK (I don't
know; the opinion here is divided on that kind of matter, see f.ex. the
regularly scheduled flamefest about binary modules), but morally it is at
least suspicious.

As long as it uses the standard system calls. Adding special system calls
might (should?) change that...
