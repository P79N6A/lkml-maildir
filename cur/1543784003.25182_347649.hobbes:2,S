The kernel is written in C and assembly. You need to port
the "kernel part" of your driver to C. Often windows "drivers"
are much more than "drivers" as known in Linux and Unix. They
often are the interface to another API such as LabVIEW,
Lab/Windows, CVI, etc., really an interface library. In
that case, the user-mode portion can be ported, often with
few changes, using C++.
