Sounds a bit backwards to me. It's like surrendering to a guy who attacks you
on the street "because he's got a knife and I don't". There is some sense in
it, but that way you're putting yourself in a position of a victim. The
reporters... ok, they own the report, but do they own the information?

So it sounds that we, the men-in-the-crowd are really left out in the crowd,
people who are affected the most by the issues. Since the vendors are not
affected by the bugs (playing a devil's advocate here), since they fix them
for their machines as they appear, way before they get public.
