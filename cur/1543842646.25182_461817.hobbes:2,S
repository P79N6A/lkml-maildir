NAK
This is not a "corner case"
Very large numbers of VIA mainboards ship with some of the VIA devices
built in and some of them on the PCI bus. In fact they generally start
shipped on the board as PCI devices and migrate over time.
You know from the northbridge which devices are internal and which are
external.
