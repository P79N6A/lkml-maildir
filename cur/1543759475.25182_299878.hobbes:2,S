The breakage introduced in 2.6.11-rc3 is still observed in 2.6.11. If in fact my configuration is wrong, I'd love to know how and why, as the configuration I'm using worked fine (with the exception of 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1786
 ) under 2.6.10:

This is to make sure that the scroll wheel shows up as 4/5 as expected,
and that the horizontal scroll shows up as 6/7, which most software
interprets as the left/right scroll buttons.
Xev says that the horizontal scrollers produce:
Scroll Left:
