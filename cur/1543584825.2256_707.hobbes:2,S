I think most of the kernel semaphores are used as mutexes, with 
occasional producer/consumer semaphores. I think the core kernel code is 
fine, the risk mostly comes from miscellaneous character devices. I've 
written code that does this for a specialised device driver. I wanted 
only one process to have the device open at once, and for others to 
block on open. Using semaphores meant that multiple shells could do "cat 
 > /dev/mywidget" and be serialised.
Locking up users of this strange piece of hardware doesn't bring down 
the system, so your suggestion could work. We need a big fat warning in 
semaphore.h, and a careful examination of the current code.
