Subject: [BK PATCH] 2 More USB fixes for 2.6.11-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Oops, Pete just told me today that these two patches should go in before
2.6.11 comes out, sorry for not adding them to the USB patches from
yesterday.  They both fix bugs in the ub driver, and have been in the
past few -mm releases.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/fix-2.6
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
