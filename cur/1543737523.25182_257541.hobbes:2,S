Most kernel software is broken, initially -- and eventually it's either
replaced with something better or tossed because no one is interested
in it.
It's not clear to me whether you're more in the "offering something
better" camp or the "not interested" camp.  But I'm curious -- what do
you see as the major issues?
Thanks,
