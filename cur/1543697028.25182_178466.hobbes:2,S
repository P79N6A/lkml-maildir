Then why do we have a -mm kernel and a -ac kernel and a.....?
It's interesting that we've apparently decided that Andrew Morton or
Alan Cox or any of the other -initial kernel streams are allowed to have
different goals (and thus different code to achieve those goals) but
we seem to think that distributions are not allowed to do the same thing...
-exec-shield is OK if it shows up in Andrew's stuff, but not when it's
in the RedHat from whence it came?  What's wrong with THAT?
