    3) don't use mem_map_*reserve wrappers in af_packet.c (alternatively
    wrapper.h can be included)
    4) I haven't found get_mem_map definition but I think virt_to_page can be
    used instead
test6-pre8 includes changes too get_mem_map and the mem_map_*reserve
so I assume it's now the preferred API -- so all your patch does is
effectively revert stuff.
