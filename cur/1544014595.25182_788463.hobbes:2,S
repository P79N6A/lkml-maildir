for the oldfs stuff we already have probe_kernel_read(). OTOH, that 
involves pagefault_disable() which is an atomic op, so 
__get_user_careful() should be much more lightweight - and we already know 
that the memory range at least _used to_ be a valid kernel address.
(Theoretical race: with memory hotplug that kernel pointer address could 
have gotten unmapped and we could get device memory there - with 
side-effects if accessed. Wont happen in practice.)
