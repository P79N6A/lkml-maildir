I tend to buy laptops that just suspend when closing the lid, and no, I never
had the strange desired to immediately reverse my choice.  Neither do I want
to stop the shutdown that I just initiated.
But for those people who do shutdown has a nice option to delay the actual
shutdown/reboot - I'm pretty sure the same can be done for swsusp without
sprinkling hooks all over the kernel.
