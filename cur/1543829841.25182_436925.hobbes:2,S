Mostly because I haven't yet broken down kinit in configurable chunks; 
it's somewhat messy to do as long as I'm maintaining a standalone 
distribution as well as the out-of-mainline kernel tree.  Not difficult 
by any means, but I've wanted to avoid combinatorics and code churn as 
long as I have a limited testing base (although -mm has vastly increased 
it.)
It's also unclear to me if it's the right thing to omit it from the 
library, ever; the only users that are affected are the ones that are 
using the shared klibc and don't have any use of zlib.
