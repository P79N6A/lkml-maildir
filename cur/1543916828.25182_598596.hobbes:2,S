Hello all,
sometime ago I submitted patch to TPM layer, originally I thought this
patch could be accepted into kernel (see below). However,
since this did not happen, I wonder, if there are some problems with the
patch or whether I am expected to do/provide something else, in order to
have it accepted.
The patch follows even more below.
Thanks,
Richard

Subject: [PATCH] Change in TPM module:
The clean up procedure now uses platform device "release" callback to
handle memory clean up. For this purpose "release" function callback was
added to struct tpm_vendor_specific, so hw device driver provider can get
called when it is safe to remove all allocated resources.
This is supposed to fix a bug in device removal, where device while in
receive function (waiting on timeout) was prone to segfault, if the
tpm_chip struct was unallocated before the timeout expired (in
tpm_remove_hardware).
