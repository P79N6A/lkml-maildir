I've been sending patches via Netscape Mail and Mozilla Mail for 
years...  inline has never ever worked, but attachments always work[1]. 
  And if the attachments are detected to be text by the internal magic, 
the attachments are properly marked text/plain and sent cleartext...
So, attach patches and make sure the patches don't have binary crud in 
them, and you're fine.
