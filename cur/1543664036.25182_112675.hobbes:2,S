Those just divide the number of hits by the size of the function IIRC,
which is useless for some codepath spinning hard in the middle of a
large function or in the presence of over-inlining. It's also greatly
disturbed by spinlock section hackery (as are most profilers).

They weren't as cheap as possible and it's a bad idea to make them so.
SVR4 proved there are limits to the usefulness of lazy evaluation wrt.
pagetable copying and the like.
You're also looking at sampling hits, not end-to-end timings.
After all these disclaimers, trimming down cpu cost is a good idea.

It's probably not swapping that matters, but high turnover of clean data.
No one can really make a concrete assertion without some implementations
of the alternatives, which is why I think they need to be done soon.
Once one or more are there we're set. I'm personally in favor of the
anonymous handling rework as the alternative to pursue, since that
actually retains the locality of reference as opposed to wild pagetable
scanning over random processes, which is highly unpredictable with
respect to locality and even worse with respect to cpu consumption.

The high arrival rates to LRU lists in do_anonymous_page() etc. were
dealt with by the pagevec batching infrastructure in 2.5.x, which is
the primary method by which pagemap_lru_lock contention was addressed.
The "breakup" so to speak is primarily for locality of reference.
Which reminds me, my node-local pgdat allocation patch is pending...

I'd just bite the bullet and do the anonymous rework. Building
pte_chains lazily raises the issue of needing to allocate in order to
free, which is relatively thorny. Maintaining any level of accuracy of
the things with lazy buildup is also problematic. That and the whole
space issue wrt. pte_chains is blown away by the anonymous rework,
which is a significant advantage.
