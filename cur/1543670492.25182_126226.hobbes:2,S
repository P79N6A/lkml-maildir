Hello,
i'm running a machine that uses the aic7xxx driver for the old adaptec 2940 scsi
controller. i had problems with getting 2.5.67-ac2 to run, it used to end in
a kernel panic. i got told to remove the body of the function ide_xlate_1024
by just "return 0;", which fixed the problem, i could then boot the kernel.
but now, when running lilo, i get the following message:
Fatal: First boot sector doesn't have a valid LILO signature
these problems do not occur on kernels 2.4.20, 2.4.21-pre7-ac1 and 2.5.67-bk9,
if i boot another kernel, i can run/install LILO without problems.
i'd appreciate any insight on this problem.
Greetings, Christian Staudenmayer
