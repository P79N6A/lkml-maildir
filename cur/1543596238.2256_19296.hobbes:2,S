You're talking about something like this?
0.............|taskstruct|guardpage(s)|stack space............FFFFFFFF

This is not               these cause
a stack space             a page fault
                          -> double fault
                          thru task gate
I don't see why task struct have to be moved elsewhere. A couple of
(not-present) pages and some support from MM subsystem is needed as
well as double fault handling code.

It could be useful as a debug feature for testing experimental kernels
(selectable by make config).
Pls CC me. I'm not on the list
