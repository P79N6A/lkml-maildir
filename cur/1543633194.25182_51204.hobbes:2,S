kmalloc (and all slab caches in general) return objects that are 
cacheline aligned.  On most arches this is 32 bytes, some higher. 
Column 4 of /proc/slabinfo shows the real size of the objects being 
allocated.

Fragmentation is minimized by the slab allocator by only allocating 
objects of the same size from a given slab.

I'm not quite following what you are saying here.  Why should the 
programmer care if he got more memory than he asked for?  He should be 
only interested in the size of the data he is working with, not the size 
of the memory that was allocated.

If you are allocating many objects of constant size, make your own slab 
cache.  kmalloc should only be used for variable sized or infrequent 
allocations.

I had made a patch for the 2.5 kernel that introduced 96 and 192 byte 
caches, which improved packing a bit.  Other than that it's not really 
worth trying to squeeze more out other than by identifying large users 
of kmalloc that can use their own slab cache.
