Lots of architectures have had in-kernel kgdb support for a long time. 
Just none of the three which I use :(
I wouldn't support inclusion of i386 kgdb until it has had a lot of
cleanup, possible de-featuritisification and some thought has been applied
to splitting it into arch and generic bits.  It's quite a lot of work.
