Well, I think that could be the next step.

I generally agree, but as far as the hibernation/suspend is concerned, I'm not
at the point of doing things more intelligently yet.  Someone who's been
developing the kernel for the last 15 years surely can do this, but not me.
OTOH, I think I can change the freezer so that it works as I outlined in the
previous message and I'd like to be able to make some progress in a direction
that's more-or-less acceptable to everyone.
Frankly, I don't see much point in developing things that you object to very
strongly, because that ultimately would lead to a loss of time, mine as well as
yours.
