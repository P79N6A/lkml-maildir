It's not actually clear that you can sensibly evaluate trends like that
or the maintainability. Take a look at the flamewar the day the kernel
tarball stopped fitting on one floppy disk (1.44MB)
Things ceasing to be maintained and exiting the kernel is a two step
process and there is a lot in the "waiting for someone to rescue it"
stage that probably has no remaining users. At some point nor far away
there is going to be a big flush of drivers when ISA bus is dropped.
Microsoft are also being very helpful. They are making it harder and
harder for people to use drivers not microsoft-signed which in turns
pushes up costs for development and as a result encourages more
standardization of driver interfaces to take place.
