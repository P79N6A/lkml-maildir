Wrt hotkey, there don't have any standard or well known method to
find out which acpi device and acpi methods are for which hotkey.
But, they are working in the similar way, which is achieving hotkey 
function through acpi generic core. 
So, at the first stage , I have to rely on user or vendor to supply 
meaningful data, till we have standard auto-config method.
Thanks,
