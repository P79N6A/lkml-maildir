Yes, I think it's worked out quite well, except for the bugs in udev
that did not anticipate kernel changes properly.  But again, those were
udev bugs, not kernel bugs.
If you have specific udev issues, that are not distro related, please
bring them up on the linux-hotplug-devel mailing list so that people can
help you out.
Or don't use udev at all, no one is forcing you :)
thanks,
