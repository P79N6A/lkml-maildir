Well you just fell into the usual trap of using the "C-like"
capabilities of C++ to call a 'C' function. If you are going
to use 'C' library functions, you don't use an object-oriented
language to call them. That is using a hatchet like a hammer.
I did not malign C++. I used it as it was designed and let
the chips fall where they may.
Cheers,
