Hello Priya,
The portable way to determine the number of cpus _online_ is:
if [ -x /usr/bin/getconf ] ; then
  numprocs=$(/usr/bin/getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
  if [ $numprocs -eq 0 ]; then
    numprocs=1
  fi
else
  numprocs=1
fi
at least that is the number I usually pass to "make -j$numprocs" when
compiling large software projects.
Regards,
Tigran

But I would like to implement it using a system call rather than use the environment variables?? I couldn't find a system call for linux that would give me the result. Could anyone please let me know if there is one for redhat linux??
