This patch looks correct. I can't recall what I was thinking when I
tossed the -4 in there. It looks suspiciously like I did it to
mindlessly compensate for a bug where I took the sizeof a pointer
rather than a type, but I would _never_ do that. I'll send this on to
jgarzik who's queueing netpoll stuff for me.
