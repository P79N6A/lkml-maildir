If there is a substantial codebase using select() for sleeping, then it 
makes sense to improve the efficiency of the kernel.  Fix it in one 
place, make all the apps run better.

select() allows for the selection of sleep time with microsecond 
precision.  The mainline kernel can't sleep for that small an interval 
anyway, so there's not really any difference in sleep precision between 
the two.
As I mentioned earlier, select() actually sleeps more accurately than 
nanosleep() on many kernels.  I haven't tested the most recent to see if 
this is still true though.
