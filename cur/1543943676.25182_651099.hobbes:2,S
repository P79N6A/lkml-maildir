The FSF is making a claim that can be traced back to the beliefs of one 
person - RMS - and that propagate their views. As I stated in the original, 
this is not just my opinion, but that of two different lawyers I've spoken to 
and also the stated belief of numerous people on LKML. 
The fact is that the GPL only affects a "derivative work" in a viral manner. 
Merely using a GPL'd libraries API is not enough to make a program 
a "derivative work".

And the LGPL was created because of the FSF propagated belief that using a 
GPL'd library means your application is automatically a "derivative work" and 
hence must be released under the GPL. So the LGPL was created with 
the "automatic" 'linking' exemption. It is not necessary and never has been.
This is why, even if the FSF claims what I've said above (that linking code 
with the GPL doesn't propagate the GPL into the non-GPL code) most companies 
won't risk it... Because the FSF has taken actions that are the exact 
opposite of their words.

Yes, It is "my" code and "my" copyright. However, by the absolutely *common* 
belief that "linking to GPL libraries makes a program a derivative work" it 
would mean that I no longer have the freedom to license my code under the 
license of my choosing, because the *mechanical* process of linking has 
caused the GPL's "viral" clause to spread to cover my code.
And you're absolutely wrong. It doesn't matter that the library is GPL'd at 
all. My code *cannot*, under any circumstances, be affected by the GPL 
license on the library. Because the libraries API *cannot* be copyrighted and 
any GPL'd code which winds up in the final binary got there via a "mechanical 
process" and doesn't affect my right to release the code under a license of 
my choosing.
Any other belief is fallacious. Claiming otherwise would mean that any program 
that uses any library on a windows system makes an application a derivative 
work of that library.
DRH
PS: I'm going to shut up again, because I've been party in my fill of these 
copyright/derivative work discussions (on both sides) and have had the 
problems with the "FSF Line" repeatedly pointed out to me.
