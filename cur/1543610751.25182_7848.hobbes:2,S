Yes. I bought an Athlon with top-of-the-line video and sound cards for
multimedia work. I *still* don't have a Linux driver for either the 3D or
the sound card, so I'm dual-booting with Windows 2000. Alsa is garbage -- they
"have a driver" for my sound card but the documentation -- what little there
is -- is incomprehensible. I even bought the OSS/Linux drivers, but they are
closed source and the documentation isn't much better. I sent e-mail to the
vendor who told me RTFM. I haven't even tried to deal with the video issues.
