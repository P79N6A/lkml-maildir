No, it doesn't.
It did in early 2.2 due to some fairly ugly hacks which just had to
go.  They worked in a lot of simple cases, but it wouldn't be too
difficult to confuse such a server so that it would start losing files.
It would be possible to add to 2.4.5, but not easy.
The basic problem is that you cannot create a reliable NFS filehandle
for a file in a FAT filesystem as there are no inode numbers or
anything similar.
What might work would be:
 In fat_fill_inode, set i_generation to the current time.
 When creating a filehandle, store:
    i_ino
    i_generation
    i_location
    i_logstart
 When when asked to lookup a filehandle:
   Call find_inode(i_ino).  
    If this finds something check i_generation.
    If it matches, SUCCESS.
   Call fat_iget(i_location).
    If this finds something, check i_logstart. 
    If it matches, assume SUCCESS.
   Then comes the tricky bit:  read the directory entry
    indicated by i_location, check the i_logstart is right,
    if it is, try to get it into the inode cache properly.
    
It is something that I would like to do, but I have lots of other
things that I want to do at the moment.
