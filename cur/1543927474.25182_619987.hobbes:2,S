That's what my patch is about: Solve the problem at it's root.

The problem is that on Linux there is currently no time-based UUID generator
which really solves the problem.
Good (bad?) thing is: Other UNIXes aren't better either.

is needed from the kernel.
Why not providing one single working version directly from the kernel and
dropping others you can't cleanly fix anyway ?
