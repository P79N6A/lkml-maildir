Hi, I am renting a root server which uses an nvidia motherboard and 
currently has a functioning 2.6.16 kernel.  Unfortunately taking the 
same .config file (make oldconfig) in 2.6.21.6 is apparently not 
spotting the ethernet controller correctly (for various reasons I need a 
newer kernel, eventually with some other patches also)
As near as I can find it should be the forcedeth driver being used 
here.  Comparing dmesg on the working kernel and the non-working kernel 
shows no obvious differences.  The working kernel uses no special 
command line options.  Can someone please help me to debug this further?
Symptoms are that dmesg suggests that the driver is being asked to load, 
but ifconfig does not show any eth0 device?
Relevant chunks of dmesg on the non working kernel are below, full dmesg 
and lspci and kernel .config are in the links at the end.  Grateful for 
any help debugging this?  How do I find out why the driver is finding my 
hardware, but no eth0 device is being created?
