Subject: 2.6.14: CR4 not needed to be inspected on the 486 anymore?

Hello,
 The following hunk of the 2.6.14 patch:

 }
disables code to retrieve the actual value of CR4 on 486-class systems
(which may or may not implement the register, depending on the exact CPU
type and stepping).  This seems suspicious to me, but I have to admit I
haven't followed the discussion on the issue if there was any.
 Zachary, I think the change originates from you -- have you done it
deliberately (why?) or has it just been a mistake?
