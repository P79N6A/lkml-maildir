  Right. APM is not enough to use on SMP. But I want only one function
  of APM, power off. Current Linux kernel can do that with the option
  'apm=smp-power-off' and LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF, but incomplete
  for me.

  I tried. My box's motherboard is ECS P6FX2-A and I updated its BIOS
  to latest, but no change for it.
