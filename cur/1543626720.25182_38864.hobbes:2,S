	Doesn't matter. The GPL only requires you to offer the source to people you 
offer the executables to. So if I copy it and distribute it to myself, I only 
have to give the source to myself. Guess what, I already have it. So I'm not 
sure why it matters whether I'm copying or not. (See, for example, clause 6 
of the GPL)
	Do you really think the GPL stands for digital rights management systems 
embedded in all your programs that you may not tamper with under threat of 
law? This doesn't sound like freedom to me. If you contribute to a GPLed 
project, then you get grant precisely the rights the GPL says you grant and 
you may impose no restrictions other than those the GPL imposes.
	The GPL imposes no restrictions on modifications whatsoever. What could be 
clearer?
