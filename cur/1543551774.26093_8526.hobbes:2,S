eth0 on my machine is a 100 Mbps interface.  eth1 is connected to a
cablemodem that only does 10 Mbps.  It's the cablemodem interface that
gives me the most grief, as whenever it resets and resynchs to the network,
it drops the ethernet link.

magic makes it work, I'll try merging it into 2.4 and let you know.
