Your advocation is "save the application, crash the OS!". But you can't
be blamed because everybody's first reaction is this :) But if you start
to think you get the conclusion that process killing can't be avoided if
you want the system keep running. But I agree Linux lacks some important
things [see my other email] that could make the situation easily and
inexpensively controllable.
BTW, your app isn't flawless because it doesn't consider Linux memory
management is [quasi-]overcommit-only at present ;) [or you used other
apps as well, e.g. login, ps, cron is enough to kill your app when it
stopped at OOM time].
