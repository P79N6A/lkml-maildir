	The first generation of Internet programs (telnet, FTP, etc.)
connect from a transient port to a well-known port, and won't see the
problem you described.  Programs that utilize fixed,
unofficially-well-known server ports in the transient local port space
are in for trouble when their clients and servers run on the same
machine.  Single-system peer-to-peer communication, with both parties
using transient local ports, has unavoidable exposure to this problem.
	Single-port self-connection is allowed by the TCP RFCs, as I
recall, although it might be a discouraged practice by now.  (Linux on
hairy palmtops?... nah, I'd never suggest such a joke.) Rather than
redesigning TCP, you could make your scanner program bind() itself to
a port before connecting (a 1 line solution to your application, no
kernel change needed).  If you want to be extra safe, allocate your
fixed port outside the transient local port range on your system (see
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range).
	As you suggest, the Linux socket/TCP code can be modified to
avoid accidental self-connections.  This can be done without
interfering with intentional self-connection.  The pertinent points
are:
1)	When connecting a socket that does not have a locally bound
	name (source TCP port),
2)	and when the destination IP address is equivalent to the
	(implied) source IP address,
3)	then avoid allocating a source port that's the same as the
	destination port.
	An even simpler algorithm is the following:
1)	When connecting a socket that does not have a locally bound
        name (source TCP port),
2)	don't allocate a source TCP port that's the same as the
	socket's destination TCP port, regardless of destination
	address.
	This involves a trivial change to
ipv4/tcp_ipv4/tcp_v4_get_port() in linux-2.2.12 and linux-2.3.15.
In the rover loop, before the "break;", add:
    if (sk->dport == rover) goto next;
	ipv6 probably needs a similar change, etc.; I haven't checked.
[TWIMC: when I connected to www.us.kernel.org tonight, the HTTP menus
were two weeks out of date.  Something's stuck.  The FTP archive was
OK, though.]
