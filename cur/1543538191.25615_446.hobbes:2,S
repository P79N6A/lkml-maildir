I'm posting again for the same thread, cause it showed again and this might 
give some more info where the problem is:
This time while I was working with xnmap, and netscape the mm was on high load
the xosview showed 1.8, 1.6 MB disk io, this way it went for 3-4min, and 
when the swap filled up, I am not sure cause the xosview showed strange
numbers about swap (as usual, actually), again started messages 
'interrupt lost', the kernel I'm still using is still test2.
Hope this helps,
