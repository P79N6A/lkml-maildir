I experimented around during lunch today, and figured out what the
problem was... unfortunately I wasn't able to post back from there.
The debianized version of ash (currently 0.3.5-7), which I use as
/bin/sh, was recently updated and no longer recognizes any options. 
This caused some literal `-n's to be added to the first line of
compile.h, which certainly confused things.  For the moment I've fixed
it by relinking /bin/sh to bash.
Sorry to waste bandwidth with this...
