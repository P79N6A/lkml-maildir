If you can detect that it is indeed your company's card and not the
competitors (who seemingly uses the same chipset), perhaps your
closed-source userland firmware load utility could take advantage of this to
refuse to load the firmware if the right implementation of the device is not
found? This'd allow you to keep the kernel driver open and still satisfy the
requirement of "screw the competition".
Just my 2¢.
