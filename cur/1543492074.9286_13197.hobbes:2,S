I haven't tried any of the later knfsd's, but 981204 when compiled with
ebcs-1.1.1 gave me some problems, some parts failed to start. I had it
compiled on a friend's machine with gcc-2.8.1 and it has been fine
since.
	When next I get time, I shall try knfsd-1.2 with egcs-1.1.1 and if that
fails, then I'll recompile with gcc-2.8.1 and see if that's OK.
	See Linus's announcement of 2.2.5, where he said there seems to be
problems with kernels built with egcs that have yet to be closely looked
at. I have had a few odd problems with things compiled here, one with
knfsd, one with modutils after 2.1.85 and another with wine. Wine
compiled fine, but it always complained of invalid paths, then last
night I downloaded the RPM binary which runs just fine.
