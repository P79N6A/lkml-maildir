no matter who decreed it. Even Linus may be wrong sometimes.

And what's exactly wrong with the other 99% solution of putting it in
/usr/src/linux-`uname -r` ? This has exactly the same advantages but
doesn't mix up between development and runtime environment; /usr/src
is clearly where source belongs and /lib/modules is an install target.
Even Linus has finally accepted that the root of the source tree is
best called linux-$VERSION rather than just linux, so this is not an
obstacle either.
