No. Not because of anti-Microsoft idiocy, but because that will introduce
a lot of cruft into the system. If NT folks want to do it - it's their
kernel and their choice. As far as I'm concerned fixing the common
interface for two *very* different kernels is idiocy. If anything, we
might look for unification with other Unices, but even that is unfeasible.
Too different VFS designs. Linux is unique in that respect (post-2.0
branches). Linux interface will change - some things should be done to fix
NFS interaction with braindead (inodeless) filesystems, etc. Linux VFS is
*good* thing, but it lacks some very nice stuff (stackable filesystems,
etc.) It *will* change. Not because somebody wants to break the stuff
left, right and center - there is more than enough in the main tree to
make such changes PITA for ourselves. But there are legitimate reasons for
changes. Sometimes it's inevitable.

Yes. As in "red-hot soldering iron in the place where the Sun never
shines". The only reasonable way, IMO, being to write a proxy fs that
would look as foo filesystem from one side and as bar VFS from another
(and the pair to it - other way round). Notice that native filesystems
would not use such thing. Said that, I'm pretty sceptical on NT future.
Yes, UNIX bigot. So sue me.
