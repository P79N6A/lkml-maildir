ugh, how bad of us.

We pass in "write=1" to force a COW.  This is because we want to do all
that memory allocation at mlock()-time, not later on, when the app writes
to the page.

So something sterner will need to be done.  I guess the write_access arg to
handle_mm_fault() would need to become a three-value thing.
