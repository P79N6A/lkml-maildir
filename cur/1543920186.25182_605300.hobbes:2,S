I'm also quite interested in what compsci students can do for the  
kernel project. I'm currently doing a little embedded development and  
research at school, but I and a few others would jump at the chance  
to work on the kernel (besides finding duplicate problems that the  
x86 merge is already taking care of, of course. ;)
Also (as an aside), we're looking at redoing our operating systems  
curriculum out here at school...anyone aware of (relatively good) OS  
curricula? (time scope: one semester.)
regards/thanks,
