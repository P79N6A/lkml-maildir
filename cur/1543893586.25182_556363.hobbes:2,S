Same __init_refok semantics confusion here ...
This time the actual issue is a __cpuinit -> __init transition in the call
chain, so the proper fix would be to mark find_num_cache_leaves() as
__cpuinit also. Also, the comment above it must be kept consistent
with the function's annotation.

You might've done this because the caller of
cache_remove_shared_cpu_map() is cache_remove_dev()
which is __cpuexit. However, cache_remove_dev() itself is called
from cacheinfo_cpu_callback() which is ... __cpuinit, because it's
caller cache_sysfs_init() is *definitely* __cpuinit. What a mess ...
device_initcall(cache_sysfs_init):
__cpuinit cache_sysfs_init
  -> __cpuinit cacheinfo_cpu_callback  <======== PROBLEM
    -> __cpuexit cache_remove_dev  <======== PROBLEM
      -> __cpuinit cache_remove_shared_cpu_map
Where cacheinfo_cpu_callback() itself is the callback for the
cacheinfo_cpu_notifier notifier, which is itself marked __cpuinitdata.
I suspect the __cpuexit-marking of cache_remove_dev() here is totally
bogus. When !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, __cpuexit == __exit, and
__exit simply means that the function can be discarded and ignored
from being linked in for non-modular (built-in) build of that particular
module. I'm not sure how the code in question here can ever be built
as a module, so cache_remove_dev shouldn't be a __cpuexit in the
first place. But not marking it anything would take us back to the
modpost warnings. So ... something needs to be done about the
logic in this whole place ...
I did some more code inspection and found:
The cacheinfo_cpu_notifier itself is called out from _cpu_down() which
is ... yep, *not* __cpuinit (and obviously *cannot* be so). _cpu_down()
is called from cpu_down() which is (thankfully!) protected inside
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, so we've /just about/ escaped trouble
so far, but another of it's callers is disable_nonboot_cpus() which does
*not* depend on HOTPLUG_CPU, but is #ifdef'ed inside SUSPEND_SMP
(gargh!) instead, and ... is _not_ __cpuinit either (obviously, again).
I got tired at that point, and stopped following the code around :-)
[ Crazy suggestion: why not just simply do away with this whole
init-section-freeing-after-initcalls / exit-section-not-linked-if-built-in
business itself?!?! I mean, it's 2007, memory is cheap, and we
only save a few 100KB at most but get so many kernel developer
man-hours totally wasted on all of this in return, which could
instead be better utilized, definitely. Anybody listening? ]

So this shouldn't be __exit either. BTW you could continue to use
__cpu{init, exit} variants for consistency's sake here too. Note that
!SMP => !HOTPLUG_CPU => __cpu{init, exit} become just the same
as the {__init, __exit} automatically.

If this is made __cpuinitdata, then thermal_throttle_init_device()
that references it must also be made __cpuinit (it is presently
simply __init). These patches are on 22-rc4, right?
Note that this is another cpu_chain notifier callback, and called
out from non-__{cpu}init functions (as discussed above) so could
be problematic.

These two changes seem to be OK.
Should've been a separate patch, IMHO.

Again, __cpuexit might not be what we want here ...

It's the same (problematic) notifier / remove_dev idiom all over again ...

This one's correct again.
