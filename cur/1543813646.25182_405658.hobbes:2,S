Nice place isn't it?  I've lived in 7 other houses since then.
Twice I sent patches to the CREDITS file, a while back, to 2.4 and 2.6
maintainers and to the CREDITS maintainer when there was one, and
received no response from anyone, nor were the patches applied.
Bit of a weak spot there?
If someone's going to take the update this time, let's make it the
right one. :)
Credits update for Jamie Lokier.
