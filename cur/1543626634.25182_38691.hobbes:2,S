I think it is the linear array that is part of the raid5 array.  RAID5
writing to the linear array (because one of the members of the RAID5 is
another linear pair of drives) probably is accounted as normal userspace IO,
and that causes the code to choose a slower transfer rate to sync.
Can someone confirm?
