Hmm. Point is, for certification/support reasons we'd rather stick to the 
RedHat ES supplied kernels instead of starting off with one of our own. I 
can't go off running non-checked-to-be-stable (in a business POV) code on 
mission-critical systems. (2.6.10 is stable enough in _my_ POV, but well..)
