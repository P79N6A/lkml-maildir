Perhaps, yes.  Though I've been trying to be open to Matt's suggestions.
Please don't mistake confusion for hostility.

Sure.  But the larger question is *should* it be extended to do so.

Except that flash filesystems don't use block devices at all.  They use
MTD interfaces.

This is where the concept starts to lose me.  Augmented how?  To not use
MTD at all (obviously with the exception of the low-level flash
drivers)?  How is that not going to duplicate MTD?  Etc, etc.
Look at it from this point of view.  MTD is the existing interface for
dealing with flash devices.  UBI was written to solve issues with flash
devices.  UBI was written on top of MTD.  Suggesting that the UBI
developers go off and hack the block layer to work with flash devices
just to use dm seems completely foreign.  Most of the boards UBI is used
on disable the block layer as much as they can because it's not needed.
This is the biggest source of confusion/contention.  Making the somewhat
magical jump to representing flash as a block device without a bit more
detail as to how it's going to really cope with the requirements needed
for flash and why it's a great idea to do so is a bit hard to swallow.
Discussing the device mapper extensions is sort of pointless until this
is figured out.

Basically because you need to store metadata in each eraseblock (and not
in OOB).  That metadata consumes space reducing the usable storage in
each eraseblock by an amount and making it no longer a power-of-two.

Artem is reworking the units per your (and other's) suggestions.  The
debugging code is also being worked on.

Some of that can probably be added, sure.  Though to be fair, it'll add
even more lines to the patch and those links have been posted 4 times
already.  They're even posted at the start of _this_ thread.  Having it
in the patch under Documentation/ is a good idea, but you can't force
people to read that before they comment on things.
