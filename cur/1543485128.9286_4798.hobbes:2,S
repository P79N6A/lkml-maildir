Ok, I've run some more complete testing using kernel version
2.1.100-2.1.102, with my P70 and it PPP problem, here's the breakdown,
including results from 2.0.36:
First, I setup an 56K capable ISDN USR Courier at the office connected to a
Linux PPP server, this helps control the environment by removing my ISP's
setup, Internet latency, etc.  These test were performed while dialed
directly into the Office Linux box at speeds of 48000Kbs or higher (this is
very consistent from my home).  The test file is a bzip'ed image of misc
files that comes to ~500K in size.  I placed three calls using each kernel
and transfered the same file from the remote machine each time using NCFTP.
The transfer rates are as measured by NCFTP on the remote end.
Kernel 2.0.36
Test 1: 5.07 kB/s
Test 2: 4.97 kB/s
Test 3: 5.12 kB/s
Kernel 2.1.100
Test 1: 4.87 kB/s
Test 2: 5.05 kB/s
Test 3: 4.85 kB/s
Kernel 2.1.101
Test 1: 5.02 kB/s
Test 2: 5.09 kB/s
Test 3: 4.99 kB/s
Kernel 2.1.102
Test 1: 3.87 kB/s
Test 2: 4.07 kB/s
Test 3: 3.65 kB/s
As you can see, the problem seems to show up for my machine quite noticeably
at the 2.1.102 kernel.  These are stock kernels compiled from a clean source
tree with a minimal config required for my PS/2 (ibmscsi, smc-mca, ppp), no
firewalling, etc.
Also, starting with 2.1.102 I get many frame errors reported on ppp0.  With
the 2.1.100 and 2.1.101 kernel I get no errors, the same with 2.0.36.  I
think this testing should be enough to prove a problem exist here, now I'm
off to see if I can figure out where.
Later,
Tom
