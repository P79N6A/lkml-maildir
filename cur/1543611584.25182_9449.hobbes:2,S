if a file is to be modified, then it ought to be
copied at make time, deleted at clean time, and
only its copy should be used. Anyway, by definition,
a modified file is not a source anymore.

so a recursive touch before a make in such a tree

Although I can't swear I never encountered this
problem, I can tell that I already had some
interrogations about strangely compiled kernels
which led me to repatch against a clean tree.
