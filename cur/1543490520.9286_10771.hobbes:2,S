Exactly. 1024^3*4K=4T

	To start with, you are *not* going to have a good life with
anything along the lines of ext2 on such sizes. Think of the time fsck
will take. So I *seriously* doubt that it goes beyond the academical
exercise. Moreover, anything beyond 16G is going to have a pretty complex
internal structure and most likely will prefer to live on a separate
device.
