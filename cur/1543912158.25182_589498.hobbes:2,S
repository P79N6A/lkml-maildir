Why would RQ2's IRQ move over to CPU_1?  That's stupid.
If you lock the IRQs to specific cpus, the load adjusts automatically.
Because packet work, in high load situations, will be processed via
ksoftirqd daemons even if the packet is not for a user application's
socket.
In such a case the scheduler will move the user applications that are
now not able to get their timeslices over to a less busy cpu.
If you keep moving the interrupts around, the scheduler cannot react
properly and it makes the situation worse.
