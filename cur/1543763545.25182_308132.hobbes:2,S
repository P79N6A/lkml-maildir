Very nice, it had a good estimate of 9ms on my test system.  Our historical
data showed that 12ms was the best on the same system for the db workload
(that was done on 2.6.8).  Scheduler dynamic has changed in 2.6.11 and this
old finding may not apply any more for the new kernel.

Paul, you definitely want to check this out on your large numa box.  I booted
a kernel with this patch on a 32-way numa box and it took a long .... time
to produce the cost matrix.
