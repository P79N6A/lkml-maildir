Right part of the goal is with doing it as we are doing it is that we can
define what the interesting state is.
Replacing software suspend is not an immediate goal but I think it is
a worthy thing to target.  In part because if we really can rip things
out of the kernel store them in a portable format and restore them
we will also have the ability to upgrade the kernel with out stopping
user space applications...
But being able to avoid the uninteresting parts, and having the policy
complete controlled outside the kernel are the big wins we are shooting for.
