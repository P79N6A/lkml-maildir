write-behind is enabled.  I'm not religious about write-behind.
Yes, there's a small chance that the disk will decide to write a
commit block in front of the data (which is at lower LBAs).  But
a) It's improbable
b) if it does happen, the time window where you need to crash
   is small.
c) if your kernel crashes, the data will still be written.  It
   has to be a power-down.
But good point - I'll test without writebehind, and with SCSI.
