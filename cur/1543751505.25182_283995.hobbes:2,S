As a quick fix, wouldn't it be easy enough to just mark USBDEVFS_IOCTL as
COMPATIBLE_IOCTL()? The number is actually different for 32 and 64 bit kernels,
so a 32 bit application that knows about this could use 64 bit data structures
and then just call ioctl(fd, USBDEVFS_IOCTL64, data) instead of using a weird
hack to achieve exactly the same.
Applications trying to call the 32 bit USBDEVFS_IOCTL would still see -EINVAL
because there is no wrapper for this.
Maybe the same can be done for some of the other ioctl calls. It effectively
means moving part of the compat layer to user space from fs/compat_ioctl.c,
but it appears that applications are already doing this.
