I know it's not something easy to find, but nor me nor Jeff master deeply the 
kobject API. And we're not short of work.
Is there anybody who while reviewing various drivers could review our ones on 
this aspect (the same way people like you use to review and fix bugs all over 
the tree)?
I know this may seem unkind, but it's a "specialization thing" - 
don't let an engineer heal somebody nor a doctor build a house, and don't 
request them doing such things - defer the thing to more competent people, if 
possible.
Alternatively, documentation is accepted. Is LDD v3 up-to-date enough? Guess 
not.
A question: looking at ide driver I saw that they don't use the 
platform_device API, because they're already in the block category.
Could we be causing trouble by using both block API (with gendisk stuff) and 
platform_device? Can platform_device
Alternatively, is drivers/input/serio/i8042.c a likely correct API example?
