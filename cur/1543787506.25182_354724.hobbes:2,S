Subject: [PATCH 10/10] [TCP]: Dont over-clamp window in tcp_clamp_window()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Handle better the case where the sender sends full sized
frames initially, then moves to a mode where it trickles
out small amounts of data at a time.
This known problem is even mentioned in the comments
above tcp_grow_window() in tcp_input.c, specifically:
..
 * The scheme does not work when sender sends good segments opening
 * window and then starts to feed us spagetti. But it should work
 * in common situations. Otherwise, we have to rely on queue collapsing.
..
When the sender gives full sized frames, the "struct sk_buff" overhead
from each packet is small.  So we'll advertize a larger window.
If the sender moves to a mode where small segments are sent, this
ratio becomes tilted to the other extreme and we start overrunning
the socket buffer space.
tcp_clamp_window() tries to address this, but it's clamping of
tp->window_clamp is a wee bit too aggressive for this particular case.
Fix confirmed by Ion Badulescu.
