maybe I'm missing something but protections have nothing to do with
remap_file_pages IMHO. That's all about teaching the swap code to
reserve more bits in the swap entry and to store the protections there
and possibly teaching the page fault not to get confused. It might
prefer to use the populate callback too to avoid specializing the
pte_none case, but I think the syscall should be different, and it
shouldn't have anything to do with the nonlinearity (nor with rmap).
