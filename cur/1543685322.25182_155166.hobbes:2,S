Hi,
I've been searching the net for quite some time now without success so I 
decided to ask the professionals. I'm looking for kernelhacker newbie 
friendly documentation on how to figure out a little more about a kernel 
lockup to be able to give the developer of a device driver some more info. 
The problem is that after a while the machine locks up with Caps Lock and 
Scroll lock blinking. I don't see any logs and no messages on the console. I 
found some posts describing similar events and it was said that the kernel is 
not completely dead in this state. Is there a way to get some more 
information? Where should I start reading.
Please CC me since I'm not subscribed. 
Thanks,
Richard
