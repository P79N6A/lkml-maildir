	Hello everybody !
   I have 3 computers. The first one exports some directories via NFS (I
will call it S). The two others (A & B) mount the directories exported
by S. For some reasons, the server S uses a fat32 partition (exported with
NFS protocol) on one of its disks (because I go to work with it and at my
office there are only fat32 capable computers...)
   So since there, nothing strange.
   I use the kernel built-in NFS server with the kernel-level 12/04/98
release (knfsd).
   Badly, there is one major problem. I can read, write and delete
everything I want except directories. If I try to erase a directory :
  - on the client side I get : "rmdir: a: Input/output error"
  - on the server side, "kernel: nfsd: non-standard errno: 16"
I have the same comportment with the 2 client computers (A & B).
I have tried the same operations with the user-land 2.2beta40 release on
the server side and it works perfectly on both computers !?
On all the computers I use 2.2.3 kernel (build with gcc 2.7.2.3), with the
good software revisions (cf Documentation/Changes). My systems are based on
a RedHat 5.2 distribution.
  If someone can find a solution or if I can help to investigate further, I
will be very pleased.
