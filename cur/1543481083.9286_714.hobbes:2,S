As was I. While I'm sure the person who reported it to /. was very
well-intentioned, the current release is a -DRAFT-, which Linus hasn't
even made any input into yet.
People, use your judgement when advertising stuff to Slashdot. It's a
great medium for promoting a finished product of the open-source
community. But a -DRAFT- press release isn't even CLOSE to a finished
product or a release of any kind.
Maybe we should have stuck with posting drafts here, instead of on the
web?
