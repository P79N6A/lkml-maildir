Well it works on my hardware: Yamaha 4416S, Advansys 940UW, 
AMD K6-2 300MHz; and on kernel versions 2.2.10->12 and 
2.3.17 . xcdroast (cdrecord version 1.6.1 I think) and
cdrecord version 1.8a24 seem ok. I do not believe there 
is any general problem and the RAID patches shouldn't 
have any adverse effect. Some adapters such as the 
AVA 1505 using the aha152x driver have given problems.
Could you be more specific?
