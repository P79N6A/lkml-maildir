drivers/media is special because it does not contain any files.
Kbuild will generate a built-in.o file only if there is
a chance for a .o file in the directory.
When all media is modules kbuild does not know enough
to say that a built-in.o is needed in drivers/media/
and the workaround to do a obj-y := common/
is the best way to do so.
We had a similar issue in driver/video once I think.
But here we solved it with the kconfig dependency.
If we only say obj-m += media/ then
kbuild will not try to link a built-in.o.
But if we say obj-y += media/ then kbuild will
expect to find a built-in.o in media/
