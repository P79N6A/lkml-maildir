archives, but

Anything sane.  Currently I talk of archives, because I need examples,
and archives have been a good example for awhile of something that can
gain things from plugins which they cannot get anywhere else, which have
implications immediately after the archive plugin is wrote, without
requiring any application support.

Fine.  It'd certainly be nice to use vim to edit an id3 tag, or a text
portion of a .sxw document (openoffice is HUGE compared to vim).

I never said it should all go in the kernel.  I repeatedly said that
most of it should not -- all that goes in the kernel is the most generic
interface that is sane.  Obviously an archive plugin is different than a
compression plugin, but once you've got the archive plugin, the rest
(individual format support) can go in userland.

So you disable it at compile time.  I don't want to use XFS, and I
certainly don't want to use ATI's video drivers.  The latter I choose
not to download, and the former I choose not to activate.
| If you want tar, you should (as a user) be able to install the "fs-plugin"
If by "as a user" you mean "not root", I have to disagree.  I think it'd
have security implications.  It'd be great if I'm wrong.

I would love for this same attitude of "runtime or bust" to be more
common.  I would love for there to be a generic way to write a userland
fs plugin, just as there's a generic way to write a userland filesystem
(lufs).  Just understand that some plugins will be in userland, and some
will be in the kernel.
And, in fact, the part of the archive plugin that knows about
tar/zip/rar/whatever goes in userspace.  But the part that does caching
probably goes in kernel space, even if it becomes a more generic
"caching plugin".
| So, please, if you go on investigating this whole stuff do it in a
more general

about, no?
Absolutely not.

file-handling, he
| should not need it. It has to be an add-on functionality, not a
replacement.
For awhile, yes.  But I can imagine that sometime in the future, an app
would need this kind of functionality.  And why not?  Is it so much
worse for an app to insist on "mp3 metadata plugin" than to insist on
"libid3"?
In any case, look at the current implementation.  I can do
	echo 750 > file/metas/rwx
but I can also use chmod, which is currently much more efficient.  I
think Hans wants to eventually create an efficient interface to access
lots of small files at once (or maybe this is done?) -- and his dream is
to see things like chmod replaced with a call to this interface.  But at
best, chmod will become a library call sometime years from now.  It will
never go away entirely.
