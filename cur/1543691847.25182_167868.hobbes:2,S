At the moment, there are two ways to control the unaligned message printing:
 - use the dmesg command to lower the printing threshold below KERN_WARNING
   ("dmesg -n4", IIRC)
 - use prctl --unalign=silent to turn off unaligned printing for a
   particular task and its children
If these mechanisms are not sufficient, there is nothing to stop
anyone from cooking up a patch.  For my puposes, what's there works
nicely so I myself have no plans to make changes in this area.
