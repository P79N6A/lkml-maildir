Hmm.  Bitmap is supposed to be written before actual data write, to mark
the to-be-written areas of the array as "being written", so that those
areas can be detected and recovered in case of power failure during
actual write.
So in case of writing to a clean array, head movement always takes place -
first got to bitmap area, and second to the actual data area.
That "written at intervals" is about clearing the bitmaps after some idle
time.
In other words, dirtying bitmap bits occurs right before actual write,
and clearing bits occurs at intervals.
Sure, if you write to (or near) the same place again and again, without
giving a chance to md subsystem to actually clean the bitmap, there will
be no additional head movement.  And that means, for example, tar -xjf
sometimes, since filesystem will place the files being extracted close to
each other, thus hitting the same bit in the bitmap, hence md will skip
repeated bitmap updates in this case.
