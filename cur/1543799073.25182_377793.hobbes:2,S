Well just because it (unfortunately) is already done by some other path,
doesn't make it a good idea by default and necessarily a reason to
further such bad principles.
The only way to really fix this would be requiring programs issuing
direct commands to a device to have it opened O_EXCL (and making sure
this actually works, right now it doesn't).
In reality, we are probably screwed :/
