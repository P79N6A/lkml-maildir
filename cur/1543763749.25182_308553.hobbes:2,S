There's no other place to push them - most of the hierarchy related 
decisions are done based on the domain tree. So the decision to make is: 
"is it worth complicating the domain tree, in exchange for more accurate 
handling of the real hierarchy?".
In general, the pros are potentially more accuracy and thus higher 
application performance, the cons are overhead (more tree walking) and 
artifacts (the sched-domains logic is good but not perfect, and even if 
there were no bugs in it, the decisions are approximations. One more 
domain level might make things worse.)
but trying and benchmarking it is necessary to tell for sure.
