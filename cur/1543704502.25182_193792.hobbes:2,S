In Documentation/SubmittingPatches it says this:
To create a patch for a single file, it is often sufficient to do:
         SRCTREE= /devel/linux-2.4
         MYFILE=  drivers/net/mydriver.c
         cd $SRCTREE
         cp $MYFILE $MYFILE.orig
         vi $MYFILE      # make your change
         diff -up $MYFILE.orig $MYFILE > /tmp/patch
 From the example I am supposed to be in my source tree, not just 
outside it.
Does the documentation need to be changed? It seems everyone I've sent a 
patch to would like a patch that looks like "diff -up 
linux/fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c.orig linux/fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c" 
instead of "diff -up fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c.orig 
fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c".
If this is the case I wouldn't mind updating the docs and submitting a 
patch. ;)
