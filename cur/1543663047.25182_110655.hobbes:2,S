Good :-) I want to avoid modules as much as possible, because
they've extensively been tackled in the past (which didn't help
much making the interfaces better), and also because they're
just a bit too political an issue.
Okay, this brings us to the issue of broken interfaces. Do we
have agreement that there are cases where interfaces like
remove_proc_entry, in their current state, cannot be used
correctly ?
Example:
static ...callback...(... struct file *file ...)
{
	void *user = PDE(file->f_dentry->d_inode)->data;
	...
	do something with "*user"
	...
}
...
	struct proc_dir_entry *de = create_proc_entry(...);
	void *my_data;
	de->data = my_data = kmalloc(...);
	...
	remove_proc_entry(...);
	/* what happens with "my_data", formerly known as "de->data" ? */
a) kfree it. May cause an oops or other problems if we're in the
   middle of the callback.
b) don't kfree it. So we now have a (hopefully small) memory leak.
   Problem: my_data may point to a lot more than just some tiny
   allocation.
Okay so far ?
(Possible solutions on the next, slid^H^H^H^Hposting :-)
