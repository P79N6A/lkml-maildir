For reasons unknown to me tsx-11 is not processing its incoming queue
anymore. Mail to the archive team also went unanswered. Thus I have to make
metalab the primary ftp server for my watchdog daemon.The tsx-11 version is
pretty much outdated (3.3 vs. 4.5). Could anyone please apply the following
patch to Configure.help so it lists the correct location?

Thanks in advance.
