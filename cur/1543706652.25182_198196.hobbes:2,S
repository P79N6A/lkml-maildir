Old code, implemented before request_firmware() existed.
The problem is that the current dvb_i2c stuff has no direct access
to a sysfs struct device, which is necessary for request_firmware().
Possible solutions have briefly been discussed on the linux-dvb list,
one of them ditching dvb_i2c in favor of the kernel i2c subsystem.
So please be patient, work is under way. See also
Documentation/dvb/firmware.txt.
