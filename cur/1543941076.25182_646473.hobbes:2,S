Funny that you mention this.
The largest latencies I currently have on RT (and rm9200) occur when
using a telnet session or NFS filesystems, thus while using network.
The impact on hardware Interrupt latencies are limited (<85us), so the
interrupt handler should still be able to keep up the receive buffer,
but context switches between threads can stall for a longer time under
some conditions.
A long shot, but can it be that the ringbuffer overflows, and that
therefor characters are lost?
Kind Regards,
Remy
