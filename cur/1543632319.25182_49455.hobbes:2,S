What I do: start lots (10-50) downloads, each with a speed of 4,5Mbps from 
another client. The two are connected using gigEthernet. downloads are over 
HTTP, with Tux or other servers (have tried several). If the clients are 
reading at full speed (e.g. only a few clients, or reading directly from 
localhost), the problem doesn't occir. However, when reading at a fixed rate, 
it seems like the server is caching itself to death.
Detailed configuration:
- 4 IBM 40gig disks in RAID-0. chunk size 1MB
- 1 x athlon 1GHz
- 1GB RAM - no highmem (900 meg)
- kernel 2.4.19pre7 + patch from Andrew Morton to ditch buffers early 
        (thread: [BUG] 2.4 VM sucks. Again)
- gigEthernet between test client and server
Anyone got a clue?
