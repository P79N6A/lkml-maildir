CONFIG_ACPI=y is necessary to parse the ACPI tables
and discover HT siblings.  Except for the rare BIOS
that gives the option to enumerate HT via MPS
(thus breaking some versions of Windows),
enabling ACPI is the only way to enable HT.
Yes, in the distant past, CONFIG_ACPI=n did not remove
all ACPI code from your kernel, and that was a bug.
thanks,
