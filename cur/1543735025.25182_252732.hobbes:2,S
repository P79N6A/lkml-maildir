Yes but what I wanted to say the filter currently in the kernel is not

I am thinking about other devices than disks. Tapes are what I know best 
but there are also other device types (all that support SG_IO).
For tapes it is fairly common to allow users read/write permissions for 
reading/writing tapes. MODE SELECT allows a user to mess up the drive 
parameters so that the next user thinks it is broken. This is not the 
purpose of giving read/write permissions in this case.

This is why I like your approach.

If you are not taking a stance, then the default list should be empty.
The starting point must be safe and it can be relaxed. I am just trying to 
have a safe enough starting point.
In an ideal world the initscripts/hotplug scripts would be updated 
instantaneously and the empty default would not be a problem. In the real 
world this does not happen and we have decide how far we want to relax the 
default security. I think this is why Linus added the filter: he wanted 
to allow users to burn CDs without special permissions. This is why I 
suggested that the default filter should allow the current default for 
CDs. It is a compromise.

I don't know any other SG_IO users than CD/DVD software that try to use 
passthrough without CAP_RAWIO. This is probably politically incorrect, but 
no sane software developer expects to be able to send raw commands without 
proper permissions. If this kind of security hole is present, it will be 
plugged sooner or later.
