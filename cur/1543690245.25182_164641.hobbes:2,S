Subject: Do I have to buy a license to use BK for kernel development?

Hi all.
I've made one or two attempts at beginning to use BK for my kernel
development work, but each time I've been stuck by the licensing code. I
use it for a little while, and then get a message about not being
allowed to commit because of logging (or something to that effect). Can
someone give me info on how to set up BK so that you don't get these
issues? (I'm assuming I don't need to buy it to use it for kernel
development). I should add that I'm doing 99% of my work disconnected
from the internet.
Can I also suggest that info on this be added to Documentation/BK-Usage?
Thanks in advance and regards,
Nigel
