No. I am planning on adapting the VM and scheduling subsystems
to use the resource accounting stuff when that gets integrated,
however.

Indeed. The new VM will be integrated with beancounter, not the
other way around.
Beancounter is a definite 2.5 issue and as such I make sure not
to rely on it in any way at the moment. Also, page replacement
should not be coupled to the beancounter stuff in any way, only
the anti-thrashing mechanisms (like swapping) and page allocation
should be.

Rik
