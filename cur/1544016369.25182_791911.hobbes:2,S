Hi Chris,
For the last few days, I was playing with btrfs. It looks really very 
promising and fantastic! :-)
Thanks for everybody who involved with this amazing file system project! 
;-) Now, I play with snapshots. Creating snapshot is a breeze. 
Recovering from snapshots work very well without any problems as far as 
I tried. But; when I tried to remove the snapshot directories, I got an 
error message that says : "cannot remove directory `snap1': Directory 
not empty". But actually, it is empty. After that, I googled a bit and 
found at "
http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Project_ideas"
 at 
"Removal Snapshots" section, it states that it needs to be implement. 
But, it's unclear which state this feature is now.
It could be perfect to prepare a document that shows the current status 
(completed, blah-blah % completed etc.) of the features,general status 
of the project and maybe deadlines of feature implementions. Like : 
"next release will have blah-blah features" etc.
BTW, is there any temporary way to remove these snapshot directories 
before this "Remove Snapshot" feature implemented ? ;-)
