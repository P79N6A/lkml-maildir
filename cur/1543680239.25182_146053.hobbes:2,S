This is clearly true, actually even more since player usually suck way
less than 2% of the CPU. If no video is involved, they simply do a write()
to /dev/dsp and then they sync by calling GETOSPACE and sleeping in the
"hope" to be wake up almost in time. I never said that the scheduler
should not be fixed. It definitely has to.
