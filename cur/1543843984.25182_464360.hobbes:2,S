Subject: [PATCH] leds: turn LED off when changing triggers

Hi Richard,
I was playing with LED triggers when I noticed that changing from
heartbeat (or ide-disk) to "none" at the right moment would leave the
LED stuck on.  This is easy to reproduce by doing "find / >/dev/null"
with the ide-disk trigger enabled and then switching to "none".
Here is a patch that fixes the problem by explicitly turning the LED
off after removing the existing trigger.
