Yes. And isn't this a bug? I fear some code is waiting for some
hardware timer value with the interrupts disabled. Since the CPU(s)
are not the only user's of I/O (bus-masters), they may miss completely
whatever they are spinning for. This could be the reason many
machines simply "stop", could it not?
Do you have an idea where to look? I need to prevent the possibility
of waiting forever for an event that may never occur, with interrupts
disabled, on at least one embedded system. Any wait-forever possibility
must be interruptible because any watch-dog timer that re-boots will end
up destroying data that must never be lost.
Cheers,
