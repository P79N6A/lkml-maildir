The point was that it's not buildable without linux-next queue
(mainly few patches from the powerpc-next git tree). So if you
apply it onto the pure linux-usb tree it won't build. Though it
will build in the -mm tree, as -mm bases on the linux-next.
That's exactly why I asked Andrew to merge it into the -mm tree
in the first place -- he would resend it to you at appropriate
time.
