As I said: currently there is one unconditional call to resize_screen
and one conditional (depending on IS_VISIBLE). Unconditional one
should not be moved around, but removed completely. Look at
fbcon_resize (only con_resize user) implementation, it will do
wrong things if called with non-visible currcons. I believe that
James has this correct in his latest patches.
