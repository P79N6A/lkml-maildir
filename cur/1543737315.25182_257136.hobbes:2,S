Subject: [PATCH] firmware_class: avoid double free
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The error exit path in request_firmware frees the allocated
struct firmware *firmware, which is good.  What is not so good
is that the value of firmware has already been copied out to the
caller as *firmware_p.  The risk is that the caller will pass this
to release_firmware, a double free.  This is exactly what will
happen if the caller copied the example code
         if(request_firmware(&fw_entry, $FIRMWARE, device) == 0)
                copy_fw_to_device(fw_entry->data, fw_entry->size);
         release(fw_entry);
from the firmware documentation.
