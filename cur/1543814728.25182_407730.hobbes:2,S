Well I was mainly just looking at the interface definition and that it
only returns an address. i386 specifically looks like it can return
ioremap memory in some cases, right? (which I don't think needs to have
a struct page behind it)

By the looks of the slab implementation, it will vary depending on
whether or not the slab was already allocated and whether that was using
__GFP_COMP or not.

I think the reason was a little different: you're getting a higher order
page. This can either be compound or non-compound. If it is not compound,
then you (or the VM) can easily end up freeing one of its constituent
pages (and PagePrivate is set when that page is free in the allocator).
Then when you go to free the whole higher-order page, it finds that one
of its constituent pages has PagePrivate set (which is a bug).
