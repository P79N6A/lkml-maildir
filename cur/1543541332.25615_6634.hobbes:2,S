Are you also responsible for this stupid depmod call? 
This prevents me from compiling the kernel on our CPU-Servers
(which are like Dual Xeon with 800MHz, 1GB and such, but I'm no
root at these) and do it at home instead (Pentium 150, 64MB). 
Many thanks, it adds about an hour of waiting :-(
Hope this stupid thing will be patched out within 
the test7-cycle, because *now* I know, why distris never provide
a standard kernel to boot from :-(
The other things are perfectly ok and _really_ make sense ;-)
