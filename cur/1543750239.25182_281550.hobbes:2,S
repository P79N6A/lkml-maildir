Andrew has indicated to me that he has merged the whole InfiniBand
patch into -mm now.
Dave, did you want to handle the entire merge of the whole IB stack,
or just the net/ parts, which are pretty trivial and stand alone,
since AF_INFINIBAND is already defined in the tree?
I'm happy to do whatever it takes to get IB merged as expeditiously as
possible so Dave & Andrew, please let me know what seems easiest and
best to you.
Thanks,
  Roland
