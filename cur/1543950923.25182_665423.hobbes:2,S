Seems that you was out of swiommu space (and aic79xx can't handle it
though it should). This happened because:
a) you produced more I/Os than swiommu can handle.
b) swiommu space leaks due to bugs.
If you hit this problem due to a), the following boot option might
help:
swiotlb=65536
The same machine run well with old kernels? If so, probably, 2.6.24
has new bugs that lead to swiommu space leak.
