The symptom is different (the picture has vertical stripes, as if
pixels get re-ordered in each horizontal line). xawtv running in
overlay mode works well. This does the same things to the hardware
wrt. PCI-PCI transfers as Xv, it's just a different driver programming
the registers - so I suspect a bug in either Xfree86 or DVB.
