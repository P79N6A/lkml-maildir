There are a number of places where people like you can
go. The Linux-MM page (
http://www.linux.eu.org/Linux-MM/
)
has a few pages with links to kernel and MM stuff.
Kernel Traffic (http:/kt.linuxcare.com/) keeps you up to
date on what's happening in kernel land.
On IRC you can go to irc.openprojects.net / #kernelnewbies.
Once in a while I show up there to help some people, maybe
other kernel hackers are interested in answering questions
there too?  (we'll see who shows up)
regards,
Rik
