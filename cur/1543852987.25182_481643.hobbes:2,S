Now this is interesting - I know there's been a long standing bug with
kernels on my Thinkpad which behave in a similar way to your description
above.  Basically whenever I change the disk in the drive I tend to need
_two_ goes to do anything with it - the first mostly always fails with
IO errors.
I've not bothered to report it because it runs a _very_ old 2.6 kernel
and upgrading the machine to something modern would be extremely painful
(read - would need new hard drive, and probably more RAM than the laptop
can take.)
