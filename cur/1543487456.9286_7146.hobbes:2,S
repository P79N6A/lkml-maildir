I defined exactly what a realtime operating system does. It is not
wishy-washy at all. But you snipped that off and reply only with
the current buzzword context. I could edit your response and make
it look absurd, also.

Now, where does it say anything about "bounded latencies". By what
authority? Since I defined realtime, I would like to know how
an additional definition got appended to destroy the concept.
Again, an operating system is realtime, if it can respond to 
external events while they are still current.
To carry this to its logical conclusion, it becomes obvious
that buffering or queuing does not help because once the second
event gets into a buffer, or onto a queue, the first is no longer
current.
If you want an OS that chops every task's CPU usage into, say,
microsecond intervals, to obtain microsecond latency, you are not
defining "realtime", you are defining an entirely different concept
which is called controlled latency.
Controlled latency is used when you need to create a filtered function
and need strictly defined sampling intervals so that the resulting filter
characteristics are deterministic. This is not generally done in a
multi-user environment, in particular where variable length data are being
read or written from file systems and networks. This is because
interrupt activity, DMA activity, and such adds randomness to
the sampling interval.
Note that interrupt activity makes the CPU "seem" slower to the
application because the CPU keeps getting taken away. DMA Activity also
make the CPU "seem" slower because the data bus keeps getting taken away.
The result is that application level activities will tend to bunch up
around intervals of interrupt and DMA activity. In the limit, all
tasks become computable simultaneously, destroying your precision
time-slicing.
I am aware that there are many companies that make a living providing
"realtime operating systems". I am also aware that few actually know
what it means. Again, it has become a buzzword to sell something that
such a company thinks is "better". Once you actually try to write
an application that works in such an environment, you get to understand
that "better" doesn't guarantee functionality.
