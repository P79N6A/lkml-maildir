I said I surely will :-)
However, there wasn't a recent version until a short time before. I just
did what you do in situations where you need a working solution: you
stick to the most promising thing. While swsusp looked abandoned there
was a huge work going on with Suspend 2.
As work started again on swsusp recently I will try that, but from what
I have read so far it looks like swsusp is scheduled to become
deprecated anyway and work will be put into uswsusp. That is all I
complain about, it means throwing away everything that is working, or
easy to get it working, and delaying working hibernate support for
another time.
Regards,
Matthias
