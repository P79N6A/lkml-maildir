Hi!
I have a client with Windows NT and after some time the link freeze: At
the NT side the send bytes counter is incremented, I see that I receive
DNS requests but I see no answer from the server to the NT.
It persist in sending POP3 responses. ipop3d is blocked in write.
Does anybody have this problem?
PPP is 2.3.8.
Kernel is 2.2.10 (same with 2.2.6->2.2.10 at least).
I think is a problem with the ppp.
Thanks!
