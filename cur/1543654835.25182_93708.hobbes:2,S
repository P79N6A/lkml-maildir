It is greatly improved.  It is still not as smooth as the standard 2.4
scheduler, but I'd characterise it as "a bit jerky" rather than "makes
me want to punch a hole in the monitor".
The difference is unlikely to be noticed by many.  (But it should be
_better_ than stock 2.4)

Again, hugely improved over normal O(1) behaviour, but not as responsive
as the stock 2.4 scheduler.
With a `make -j1' running:
- Normal O(1) behaviour in StarOffice 5.2 is 15-30 second delays between
  actions.
- With 2.4.20aa1, typing into a text document typically had a 2-3 character
  delay.
- With the standard 2.4 scheduler the delay is zero characters.
So StarOffice 5.2 is still a bit uncomfortable to use with 2.4.20aa1.
