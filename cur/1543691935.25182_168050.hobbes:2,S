Against test5-mm4. This is commented a bit better than the previous
version I sent to Al and Jens.
sysfs interface is /sys/block/*/queue/io_scheduler. Valid values are
as, deadline, noop, cfq. Switching schedulers under disk load works fine
in my tests. sysfs stuff seems to be working nicely and handles lingering
userspace references properly.
Review of the kobject / sysfs stuff would be especially helpful. Thanks.
