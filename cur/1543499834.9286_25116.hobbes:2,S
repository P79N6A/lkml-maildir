Is it just me, or does this sound suspiciously like...
 1. Windows 95 being unstable on an AMD K6-2/350 and unusable on
    K6-2/366 and above due to a Win95 timer divider being zero due
    to the processor's speed.
 2. An overclocked processor due to some Taiwanese 'entrepreneur'
    rebadging chips with higher speed ratings so they can charge
    higher prices for them.
Best wishes from Riley.
