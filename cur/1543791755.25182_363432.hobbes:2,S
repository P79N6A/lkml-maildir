It's a good start! I approve. The time stamp and kernel version must
have come out of a rift though ;->
The web page covers a broad line of our products, many of which are
*not* aacraid based. No big deal, but I must admit Adaptec has not
placed a clear delineation. All late model RAID cards from Adaptec are
based on the aacraid interface.
Dell CERC, IBM ServeRAID 7t, 8i & 8k and ICP 9014, 9024, 9047, 9087,
5085, 9085 & 9067 SATA and SAS cards are missing.
