   for some research that i am working on, i am doing some experiments
   with the linux kernel and some tcpip stuff in particular.  In any
   case, in the tcp_rcv function, i have been able to get most of the
   information that i need.  Now i need to modify the sequence number
   of the packet and then recompute the checksum, but i am not sure
   how to go about this.  I have expermimented for a while and turned
   up nothing.
   basically, i want to just modify the th->seq and then recompute
   the tcp checksum and i suspect the skb checksum.
Why do you need to recompute the checksum on incoming packets, at
tcp_rcv() the checksum has already been validated as correct and is
never checked again?  ie. nobody else cares about the checksum
