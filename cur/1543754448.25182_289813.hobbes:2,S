Hi,
here you are gzip-ed dmesg from booting 2.6.8.1 - i've been playing 
keyboard while booting, maybe interrupt reports will help you. also my 
.config part follows:
CONFIG_INPUT=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT=y
CONFIG_SERIO=y
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y
CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
no modules or other built-ins. maybe it is some simple way to fall back 
to old handling mechanism? in my system most of programs (i mean 
x-server) uses hardware directly (what means uses /dev/ttyS0 as mouse 
device). i'm grateful for any help.

May the Source be with you.
