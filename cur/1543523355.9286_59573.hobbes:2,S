Hmm, interesting. I quote (in case someone else is interested)
 * outside observer to measure.  Randomness from these sources are
 * added to an "entropy pool", which is mixed using a CRC-like function.
 * This is not cryptographically strong, but it is adequate assuming

 * the overhead of doing it on every interrupt is very reasonable.
Why not use XOR, which is 'pretty quick' too, and *really* doesn't care if
your mixing in your bookmarks file or radioactive decay data?
