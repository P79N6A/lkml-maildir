We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.22.16
kernel.
It contains a single fix for a problem that could cause a local user to
cause file system corruption on some types of filesystems.
All users of the 2.6.22 series are encouraged to upgrade.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.22.15 and 2.6.22.16
The updated 2.6.22.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.22.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
