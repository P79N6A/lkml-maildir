Yes, but there is only a very small set of PC hardware features you need 
to implement, and most BIOS'es only look at those things for timing 
purposes. Unfortunately there is no standard for how BIOS'es do internal 
timing and delay loops, so we emulate them all (8253 timers, speaker 
ports and CMOS time/date support ;-).
When we come across a new card that doesn't work we figure out why and 
make new additions to the video boot code. However at this point we think 
we have covered just about every card out there, as I don't think there 
are any cards in our labs that don't work at present. If there are, 
fixing them is just a matter of spending the time to debug it.
