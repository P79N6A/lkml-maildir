Yes, but the new version of FIXUP_ESPFIX_STACK _will_
use the annotations (that was Zach's complain), and therefore
it can't be used in a .fixup, and so the new UNWIND_ESPFIX_STACK
_will not_ use the .fixup, just like it was before your change.
I am not saying that your change was wrong, but now I had to undo
it. Let me know if that makes a problem.
