Here is my dmesg... I also tought of taking a screenshot of k3b in a burning process but letf it home :)
Anyhow, if you need me to run a few tests to find out exactly where/how/what made ATAPI work correctly on sata_via just ask.
Also note that I disabled irqbalance and switch back to my onboard nic using skge yesterday night and it did solved all my other problems (jerky mouse, lan dropping, PC freezing, etc.).  I presume that using sk98lin would work also.  A fix for that would solve many problems on K8T800 chipsets.

Here is the most interesting part which does not say much more than it used to... except that it does detect it properly:
