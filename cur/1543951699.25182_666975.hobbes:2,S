Hrm.  I suspect that the documentation which Liam is currently writing
(together with some actual in-tree users) will help here.

Well, the platforms I've looked at do implement a fairly standard
registration API to set up their clocks, even if it's only used to
configure things for the particular SoC variant in use and does tend to
omit things not used on the platform in question.

That looks like it'd help a lot in making the feature set implemented by
the clock API consistent over platforms.

Right; any regulator API is going to need to cope with connecting
multiple chips together since that's such a core use case.

We'll try to implement this before we next resubmit.

That's the aim, and some of this works already.  For example, regulators
with no set_voltage() are supported by the core.

In API terms I'm not sure it even needs a refocusing - I think the API
can already support everything you're asking for in this subthread
except for the addition of an API to allow platforms to map a symbolic
name and device tuple to an actual regulator.  Some of the cases that
can be set up will require additional work in the core to support them
but doing that shouldn't affect anything that doesn't directly deal with
those cases.
