Matti, if I give you a really large, pointed rock, can you apply it to the
head of whoever subscribed a moderated eGroups list to l-k?
Actually, shouldn't eGroups be sending this sort of thing to the envelope
sender, anyway?
Mind you, it's given me an excuse to pop egroups.com into /etc/mail/access..
