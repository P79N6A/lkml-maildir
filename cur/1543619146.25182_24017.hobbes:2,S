Marking the page table entries rather than the page directory entries
read-only is a lot of work on a large process. And it doesn't make a lot
of sense for a large process that wants to fork/exec something tiny.  In
fact, I'm slightly worried about the possible growth of the page
directories on really big boxes. Detaching the entire mm is comparatively
cheap and doesn't grow with process size.

Fork/exec is far and away the most common case, and the fork/fork case is
rare enough that it's not even worth thinking about.
