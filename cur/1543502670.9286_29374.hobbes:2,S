Partly that...

Most config files _are_ edited by root, but ext2 defragmentation is an
equally good reason.
Why does one reason have to be wrong?  If we have two valid reasons for
doing something, do we have to own up to only one of them?
When we added this stuff it was primarily for fragmentation, but we were
fully aware of the fact that it would be a failsafe for root at the same
time.  They are both good reasons for keeping a reserved portion.
