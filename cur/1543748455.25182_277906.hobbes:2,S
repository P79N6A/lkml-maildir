can you reproduce this with rtc_wakeup:

?

here's the code:
+static inline void trace_start_sched_wakeup(task_t *p, runqueue_t *rq)
+{
+       if (TASK_PREEMPTS_CURR(p, rq) && (p != rq->curr) && _need_resched())
+               __trace_start_sched_wakeup(p);
+}
indeed this only triggers if the woken up task has a higher priority
than the waker... hm. Could you try to reverse the priorities of 
realfeel and IRQ8, does that produce traces?
