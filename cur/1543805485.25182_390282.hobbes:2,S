in 2.6.16-rc1:
find_busiest_group(....
	load = __target_load(i, load_idx, idle);
else
	load = __source_load(i, load_idx, idle);
where __target_load and __source_load is where we take into account prio_bias.
I'm not sure which code you're looking at, but Peter Williams is working on 
rewriting the smp nice balancing code in -mm at the moment so that is quite 
different from current linus tree.
