sata_mv drives the marvell chipsets, you want 2.6.16/17-rc for this.
There is no such thing as a "generic" SATA driver as all SATA chipsets
have their own interfaces, unlike PATA where there was a basic standard.
A standard is emerging (called AHCI) and in time it may be that all SATA
uses the same driver just as we have few USB drivers.
