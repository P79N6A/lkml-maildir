Hi,
The problem comes in when you bump the FIXLEVEL for example, by one.  At
that point the LINUX_VERSION_CODE would not change even though you have a
new kernel and modules compiled for the previous version may not load or
may load and not work correctly (just one example).
EXTRAVERSION on the other hand is not used for LINUX_VERSION_CODE
calculation.  
Regards
James Bourne
