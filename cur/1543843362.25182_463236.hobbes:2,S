I disagree completely with this approach.
You don't need a table of hooks for the case where libata is disabled in 
.config.  Thus, it's only useful for the case where libsas is loaded as 
a module, but libata is not.
And the cost of having libata loaded via the normal symbol resolution / 
module load mechanisms is low, so adding a table of hooks completely 
wrapping libata functions is just silly.
The libsas code should directly call libata functions.  If ATA support 
in libsas is disabled in .config, then those functions will never be 
called, thus never loaded the libata module.
