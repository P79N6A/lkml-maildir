I'm happy to stop using broken and deprecated APIs, providing that 
there's *actually a replacement*.

To the extent that that's possible, I entirely agree - however, it 
clearly isn't always. Not all hardware can be powered down without 
losing functionality, and so in those cases it's important that there be 
a mechanism to allow that decision to be made by userspace.

But in the cases where you don't have fine grained power management in 
the hardware, it's still desirable to be able to suspend an unused 
network agent. The driver can't do it by default, because that would 
break existing behaviour.

The fact that something is scheduled to be removed in July 2007 does 
*not* mean it's acceptable to break it in 2006. We need to find a way to 
fix this functionality in the meantime.
