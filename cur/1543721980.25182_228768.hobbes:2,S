Hi
First. Kernels <= 2.6.5 don't have this problem. After 2.6.6 show this
behaviour sometimes i downgraded to 2.6.5 as i thought that it would be
fixed in 2.6.7, but 2.6.7 also show this behaviour.
The I/O i do is split some large files (>2GB) into smaller files <= 2GB.
Sometimes the process that does this just hangs (currently i have such a
hangung process), top currently shows up to 90% I/O-Wait.
SOME of my "konsole"s(xterm) hang then too, but others don't (like this
where i type this email) starting new "konsole"s sometimes work, sometimes
not.
System is:
Distribution: Debian SID.
2xP3-933Mhz, 3GB-RAM, Serverworks HE-SL-Chipset
"System"-HDD is SCSI connected via Symbios-53c1010 (Dual U160)
"Data"-HDD(s)(where the split-process does it's work) is connected to a
Highpoint RocketRAID 1540 (HPT-374 Chipset)
Filesystem is XFS for the Data-HDD(s) and Reiserfs for the system-HDD.
If other info is needed i will provide them.
Bis denn
