Ok, thanks for the reply. This is what I've tried (I have a single
core (old) cpu):
# uname -r
2.6.29-0.35.rc1.git4.fc11.i686
# cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
# find .|grep online
./online
# cat online
0
# echo 0 > online; echo 1 > online
-bash: online: Permission denied
-bash: online: Permission denied
# chmod +rw online
# echo 0 > online; echo 1 > online
-bash: echo: write error: Input/output error
-bash: echo: write error: Input/output error
Yep, I am a bit confused - any hints appreciated!
