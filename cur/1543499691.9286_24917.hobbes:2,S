Subject: 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 Unable to Open an Initial Console

Hi, I am unable to get a console in both 2.2.9 and 2.2.10. Kernels up to
2.2.8 have no problems. I'm using redhat 5.2 with all the kernel-2.2
updates. The kernel is not compiled with unix98 tty support.
Here is what dmesg shows:
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 40k freed
Warning: unable to open an initial console.
I get these messages in the logs:
Jun 19 07:51:00 gord /sbin/mingetty[10378]: /dev/tty1: cannot open tty: Operation not supported by device
Jun 19 07:51:00 gord modprobe: can't locate module char-major-4

Jun 19 07:51:00 gord /sbin/mingetty[10388]: /dev/tty6: cannot open tty: Operation not supported by device
After this goes on for a while, the logs show init respawning too fast,
disabled for 5 minutes and then it repeats 5 minutes later.
Here are the related kernel config options I used:
#
# Character devices
#
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL=y
# CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_NONSTANDARD is not set
# CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS is not set
CONFIG_PRINTER=m
# CONFIG_PRINTER_READBACK is not set
CONFIG_MOUSE=y
#
# Console drivers
#
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
# CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT is not set
# CONFIG_MDA_CONSOLE is not set
# CONFIG_FB is not set
I'm stumped. I've had no problems like this with previous 2.2.x kernels.
Any help is appreciated.
