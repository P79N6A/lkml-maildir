Looks at the overhead of the normal IRIX sleeping locks vs linux spinlock
(and the priority inversion and sleeping locks arguments are the next one
I'll get from you I bet :)), talk to Jeremy how the HBA performance went
down when he had to switch the drivers to the sleeping locks, look at the
complexity of the irix scheduler with it's gazillions of special cases
(and yes, I think the current Linux scheduler is already to complex), or
the big mess with interrupt thread.  
I've added Larry to the Cc list because he knows the IRIX internals much
better than I do (or at least did once) and has been warning of this move
that adds complexity to no end for all the special cases for at least five
years.  He also had some nice IRIX vs Linux benchmarks when Linux on Indys
was new.
