The point Ingo was making is that the x86 ABI already requires the FPU
context to be saved before *all* function calls.
Unfortunately, this isn't true of other ABIs -- looking over the psABIs
specs I have laying around, AMD64, PPC64, and MIPS require at least part
of the FPU state to be preserved across function calls, and I'm sure
this is also true of others.
Then there's the other nasty details of new thread creation --
thankfully, the contents of the TLS isn't inherited from the parent
thread, but it still needs to be initialized; not to mention all the
other details involved in pthread creation and destruction.
I don't see any way around the pthread issues other than making a libc
upcall on return from the first system call that blocked.
