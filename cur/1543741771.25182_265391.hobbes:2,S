Well I cribbed it from the nfsroot code, which is perhaps not up on
fashion.

Uh, so we can send packets before userspace has configured the network?

I don't expect it does. Usually we have our own IP address from the
command line, but if we don't, we will check if there's an in_dev
connected to the device and if so, look up the device's IP. This is
useful for the modular case where the network is up before we start
and we have a handy default for local IP.

Does this actually happen? I'm checking in_dev for null already, but
perhaps I need to check ifa_list as well.

Maybe. We should probably revisit the nfsroot code as well.
