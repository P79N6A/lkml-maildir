From ChangeLog-2.5.42
<mochel@osdl.org>
        IDE: Add generic remove() method for drives; remove reboot notifier.
        The remove() method is generic for all drives, and set in ide_driver_t::gen_driver.
        The call simply forwards the call to ide_driver_t::standby(). 
        This obviates the need for IDE reboot notifier. The core iterates over all present
        devices in device_shutdown() and unregisters each one. 
<mochel@osdl.org>
        IDE: make ide_drive_remove() call driver's ->cleanup().
        This was accidentally dropped before, but re-added now to completely mimic
        behavior of the reboot notifier IDE used to have. 
And if you look at the changes you will notice ->suspend used to be called
only on a halt, but now it is also called on a reboot.
