Hi Luke,
I enjoyed your recent talk at OxLUG in which you mentioned this
briefly. Could you please send me the source that you are working on
so that I can take a look and make suggestions if tha'ts useful - I
posted to the OxLUG list but you're not actually on it and although I
now have your address from someone, this post reminded me.
I've copied lkml for two reasons - a). Someone else might want to take
a look. b). I sat and talked with Luke for a while about this, he's
not a typical "I want to do stuff in the kernel I should be doing from
userspace" kind of person in my opinion (there might still be a better
way but until I see more what he's actually doing then I can't work
out what).
Jon.
