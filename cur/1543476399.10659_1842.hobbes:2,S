:Is there any tool that gives the corresponding filename for every inode
:for ext2 file system? 
:It should print out the inode number, the file name with entire path
and
:tell the kind of inode it is.

I doubt there is a quick way to do it, so I assume you'll have to
do a forward search, so why not
find /dir -xdev -printf '%p %i\n'
As for the type of inode, that's a little harder but can be done.
