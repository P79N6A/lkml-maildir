Yes.  Once per day is typical.

I pull Linus's tip-of-tree then I pull your tree then I run git magic to
generate the linus->you diff.  The git magic varies, but is usually
	git reset --hard "$upstream"
	git fetch "$tree" || exit 1
	git merge --no-commit 'test merge' HEAD FETCH_HEAD > /dev/null
	{
		git_header "$tree"
		git log --no-merges ORIG_HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
		git diff --patch-with-stat ORIG_HEAD
	} >$PULL/$tree.patch

No problem at all.  In fact, people do this so often that I now always do a
`git-branch -D' before pulling each tree.

The things which cause me trouble are:
- git trees which are based on other people's git trees (eg, git-wireless
  is based on git-netdev-all).
  I have other git-pulling scripts which usually manage to sort this out.
- git trees which have lots of merge rejects
  I'll usually kludge these locally, but maintainers who resync with
  Linus frequently and fix these things up are appreciated.
Problems are rare and you're unlikely to hear from me - just do whatever
you want to do and I'll cope ;)

This is a patch I added to -mm to make your tree compile correctly when combined
with a different tree (in this case, -mm itself).  I frequently have such
patches and I will send them to the appropriate developer when it is time
for that developer to merge it (ie: the thing which their tree conflicts
with has been merged into mainline).
In this case, add-include-linux-freezerh-and-move-definitions-from.patch
was merged yesterday, so I sent
ubi-versus-add-include-linux-freezerh-and-move-definitions-from.patch to
you, because you now need it.
