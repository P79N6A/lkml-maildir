There is many per-subsystem debugging stuff in kernel. I do not see
_objective_ any reason to prohibit use have our own debugging stuff in
UBI. It is compiled out when disabled. It helps to quickly fix bugs. It
helps to check if new patches introduce bugs (assertions, paranoid
checks). These are _objective_ reasons to keep it.
