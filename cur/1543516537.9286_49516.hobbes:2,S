The time-keeper (32kHz temperature-compenstated piezoelectric resonator)
in the RTC is much more stable than the CPU clock, which in recent
boards isn't even a quartz crystal, it's a cheap barium titanate
"Ceramic resonator".
I don't think the you should set the RTC from the kernel except during
the following once-a-day crond script.
rdate time-a.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov	# Set time to NIST
clock -w				# Set RTC to your time
This will keep your RTC within a second for all time. FYI, most
kernels show the stability per 24-hour period shown in the attached
log.
