Umh... I'd really, really like them in, I am probably going to hit 64K
users sometime next year. It would be a shame to change OS for that or
rebuilding half a linux dist with a patched kernel and glibc.
AFAIK most patches are already done and the 2.4 kernels would be a good
reason to rebuild a dist completely ( RedHat 7 ? Debian 3 ? )
so if this isn't it, it 'll probably have to wait until 2.6 or something..
