I've received a number of suggestions via private mail regarding my
inability to get opl3 and/or soundblaster functionality to work with the
current development kernel, none of which helped.  I've also tried
numerous permutations of append options, compile options, etc. to no
avail.  I'm wondering if card/function initialization could factor in
here.  In a working configuration (2.3.47 and previous) the order is
PAS16, soundblaster, opl3.  In 2.3.99x the order is opl3, soundblaster,
pas16.  Is there some way of specifying initialization order here so I
can test this?
