    I reported this same problem some weeks ago - 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103069116227685&w=2 . 
2.4.20pre kernels solved the error messages flooding the console, and 
improved things a bit, but system load still got very high and disk read 
and write performance was lousy. Adding more memory and using a 
completely different machine didn't help. What did? Changing the Adaptec 
scsi driver to aic7xxx_old . The performance was up 50% for writes and 
90% for reads, and the system load was acceptable. And i didn't even had 
to change the RedHat kernel (2.4.18-10) for a custom one. The storage 
was two external Arena raid boxes, btw.
Regards,
Pedro
