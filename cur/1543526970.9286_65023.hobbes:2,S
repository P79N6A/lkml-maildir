newfd need not be closed, just shut down.  This way you save a close()
syscall :-)
That's not necessary for fd recycling to work though.  Closing is fine
for that.
But see my other message for why inheriting properties from the parent
socket might be more appropriate, at least for TCP options.  (Signal
number and pid are obviously better not inherited from the parent socket).
