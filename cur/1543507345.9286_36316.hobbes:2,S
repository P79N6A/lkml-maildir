Greetings,
In 2.2.12, /proc/cpuinfo reports two processors detected on my
single-processor AlphaStation 200 4/233:
(bryan/bryan.1@neptune) ~ % cat /proc/cpuinfo

Otherwise, the information is correct.  When I look at the code for
printing this information (from the hwrpb struct), I see that it is not
filled in or deduced by the kernel at all, and comes straight from the
firmware.  Does the value need to be adjusted prior to output, or does my
firmware have multiple-processor disorder?  The firmware is SRM version is
6.8.
thanks,
