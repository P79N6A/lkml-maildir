gcc is often (as in all kernel builds) run with -pipe, which does this.
and no, it doesn't create a long runqueue simply because each stage does real
work.  that's what's missing from the two (stupid) benchmarks exhibited so
far as a reason to change the scheduler.  here's another fine example:
   dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k count=1k | cat | cat | cat | cat | wc; uptime
on my machine, it caused about 30 seconds of 45-50K cs/second, and a load
average that eventually (with count=30k) approached only 1.9...
