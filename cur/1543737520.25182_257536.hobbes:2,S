Subject: [PATCH] set membase in serial8250_request_port
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

   I'm running into a problem that seems to be caused by this really old
changeset:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@3d9f67f2BWvXiLsZCFwD-8s_E9AN6A
When I run 'setserial /dev/ttyS1 uart 16450' on an ia64 system w/ MMIO
UARTs, I get a NAT consumption oops from the kernel.  The problem is
that this code path calls serial8250_release_port() where the membase
gets cleared.  However, the subsequent call to serial8250_request_port()
doesn't restore membase, causing a read from a bad address.  I don't see
many users of the UPF_IOREMAP flag, so I think the solution is to simply
make the remap case symmetric to the unmap case.  Patch below.  Thanks,
	Alex
