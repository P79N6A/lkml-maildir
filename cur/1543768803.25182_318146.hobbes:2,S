I would have though so, but I can say from personal experience that
SanDisk brand CF cards respond to losing power during a write by producing
a bad sector.  I had assumed that a sensible implementation would take
advantage of the out-of-place writing by doing a two-phase commit at
write time, so writes would be atomic.
Does anyone know of a CF manufacturer that *does* guarantee atomic writes?
Obviously, if power is lost during a write, it's not clear whether
I'll get the old or the new contents, but I want one or ther other and
not -EIO.
Given that SanDisk first developed the CompactFlash card, you'd think they'd
be a fairly reputable brand...
