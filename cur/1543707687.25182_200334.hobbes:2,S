Subject: Re: [PATCH][BUGFIX] : Megaraid patch for 2.6 1/5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Patches 1-5 look OK to me.
If you are attempting to follow LSI's megaraid (in 2.4 only, sigh), 
patch #4 may wind up causing you grief in the future.  Hopefully Atul 
will pick it up, though :)
