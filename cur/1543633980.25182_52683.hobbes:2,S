i have planned to submit the irqbalance patch for 2.4-ac real soon, which
needs this function - current IRQ distribution on P4 SMP boxes is a
showstopper.

the setaffinity()/getaffinity() interface looks pretty robust, i dont
expect any changes - there's just so many ways to set an affinity mask for
an opaque set of CPUs. And being able to set affinities is something that
was frequently asked for by application developers.

IMO BUG_ON() is just an ugly way of doing an assert(), i dont like code
with magic conditionals embedded within. But, the main reason was that
2.5-mainline has the code so that's being used.

like above, 2.5 is the reference base. Especially for 100% nonfunctional
things like this it makes no sense to apply them to 2.4-ac only. But i
agree that existing comment fixes should be forward ported into 2.5, i've
applied them to my tree.
