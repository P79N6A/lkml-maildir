Hi,
This has happened twice now. I have the following in my kernel log:
acpi_power-0377 [25] acpi_power_transition : Error transitioning device [FAN] to D0
acpi_bus-0256 [24] acpi_bus_set_power    : Error transitioning device [FAN] to D0
acpi_thermal-0611 [23] acpi_thermal_active   : Unable to turn cooling device [c1be7d34] 'on'
Everything under /sys/devices/legacy/i2c-1/1-0290 is frozen to the same
values, none of the sensors are being updated. 
Not quite sure what is going on but it looks like an ACPI thermal trip
routine might be messing up the W83627HF sensor driver.
