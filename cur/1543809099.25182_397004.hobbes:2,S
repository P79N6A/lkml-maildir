Did you mention about here in free_area_init_core()?
I recall about here.
              :
	if (!size)
		continue;
	zonetable_add(zone, nid, j, zone_start_pfn, size);
	zone_wait_table_init(zone, size);
	init_currently_empty_zone(zone, zone_start_pfn, size);
	zone_start_pfn += size;
              :
All of zone_size[] is set zero at new_pgdat_init().
So, init_currently_empty_zone() is not called at this point. Indeed.
However, when __add_section() is called for first section on the node 
after that, hot_add_zone_init() is called, and it calls
init_currently_empty_zone().
