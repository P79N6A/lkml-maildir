Ok, I agree with this, it echoes what I said in another message in this 
thread ;-)  namely,
* the fact that pci_enable_device() does not claim the resources is a 
problem.  pci_request_regions() should not be a separate step.
* the fact that pci_disable_device() does not perform the _exact_ 
opposite of the operations that pci_enable_device() performed is a 
problem.  pci_disable_device() should not just unconditionally stop the 
decoder bits, then exit.
