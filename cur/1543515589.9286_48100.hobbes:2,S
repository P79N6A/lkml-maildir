- The machine doesn't hang, so if it's a level triggered interrupt,
something must be disabeling the interrupt. 
- It would've been pretty obvious to someone looking in
/proc/interrupts that the interrupt is shared.
- Could some device be holding hte interrupt line "active" for say 10%
of the time (without feedback from its driver!), and thus triggering
"short" interrupt storms?
If the interrupt indeed isn't shared, I would recommend enabelign
debugging on the AIC7xxx driver. This should tell you what the chip
thinks needs to be addressed. (I'm not familiar with the AIC driver,
so I don't know how much debugging it will spew at you from the
interrupt routine.)
