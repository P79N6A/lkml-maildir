If the PCI device ID is 3065 then it's via-rhine, but not supported by the
driver in the kernel. Get updated via-rhine from Donald Becker's site
http://www.scyld.com/network.
Even the DFE-530-TX driver for NT downloaded from D-Link's site doesn't know
about this chip yet ... though changing the device ID in the .INF file seemed
to make it work ... shrug.
