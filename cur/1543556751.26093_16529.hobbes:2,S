You cannot imagine how frustrating it was to search for the archive.  I
couldn't find an up-to-date archive, and www.kernel.org keeps silence
about mailing lists. I cannot afford subscribing to every list just to
slightly polish support for my hardware.

Well, 0x5401 is TCGETS. Other sound drivers just ignore it. I believe the
drivers should only log the ioctls that are relevant to them (i.e.
sound-related ioctls for sound drivers) and are not implemented.

So, it's not just a matter of changing the constants under "case
SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED" in ymf_ioctl()? Actually, I hacked them to be
4000<rate<50000 and it worked fine, but I'll drop this part of my patch if
you believe it's unsafe.
Anyway, the problem with handing sox is solved by replacing all ENOTTY
with EINVAL in ymfpci.c. It has nothing to do with the lower frequency
limit. No other sound driver ever uses ENOTTY.
