Hi Zack,
You might want to have a look here, there's lots of good stuff:
   
http://arx.fifthvision.net/bin/view/Arx/LinuxKernel
   (Kernel Hackers SCM wish list)
   
http://arx.fifthvision.net/bin/view/Arx/GccHackers
   (Gcc Hackers SCM wish list)
Arx is a fork of Tom Lord's Arch, now in version 1.0pre5.
Regards,
Daniel
