I was thinking that we only need to worry about the d-cache coherency at
the time of hugepage fault.  But that is not a safe assumption.  You are
right that we will need update_mmu_cache in the hugetlb page fault path.
Though I'm wondering if we can hide this update_mmu_cache fucntionality
behind the arch specific set_huge_pte function in the demand paging
patch for hugepage.  If so then we may not need to make any changes in
the existing update_mmu_cache API.
Thanks, rohit
