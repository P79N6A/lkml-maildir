My guess is that you're using gcc 2.95 possibly from Debian? (Other distros
might be affected too, I don't know). The cpp shipped with the Debian's gcc
2.95-15 doesn't parse the ##arg part of the varargs macro DRM_ERROR (or any
other) for that matter. It is supposed, per docs, to remove the comma should
the variable args (the "rest") be empty - it leaves the comma there instead,
which renders incorrect C code. I have submitted the bug to the Debian
gcc maintainers.
greetings,
marek
