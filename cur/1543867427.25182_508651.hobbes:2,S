Oleg,
	This patch probably needs review for any races we may have
missed to account for.  Also we have considered only workqueue.c present
in 2.6.20-rc6-mm3, which means some recent patches in mm tree which are
yet to be published arent accounted for.
Also I expect almost all worker threads to be frozen "for hotplug". The
only exception I have found so far is kthread workqueue, which needs to
remain unfrozen "for cpu hotplug" because kthread_create (in
CPU_UP_PREPARE and stop_machine) relies on its services (while everyone else 
is frozen).
