The "figure out" task is easy:
There has to be a _very_ good reason for not deleting an inline in a .c 
file.
inline's in header files are a different topic, but in their case an 
explicit review would be better since the correct solution is in such 
cases often to move the code to a .c file (this might even result in 
additional space savings).

I still don't understand why gcc needs any "inline" hints at all except 
in the cases where we want to force gcc to inline a function.
