I've just rewritten noflushd to deal with multiple disks as well as SCSI
disks. The code is still very alpha but if you're (or anyone else is)
interested, I can send you a snapshot of my current devel tree. You'll
still need a kernel patch for SCSI. Others have already pointed out the
caveats of spinning down disks in the first place...
Regards,
Daniel.
