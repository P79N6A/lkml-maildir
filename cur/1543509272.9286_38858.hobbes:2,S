Hello Everybody,
i have a strange networking problem here and i hope someone can shed some light on it.
My setup is as follows:
                                                +--------< Satellite
                                                | 
                              net1         +----+---+
                   +-----------------------| Win 98 |
                   |eth1                   +--------+
            +------+-------+
ISDN to ISP-| Linux Server |
            +------+-------+
                   |eth0              eth0 +-------------------+
                   +-----------------------| Linux Workstation |
                           net0            +-------------------+
Both Linux Machines run SuSE 6.2 and have been upgraded to Kernel 2.2.12 (self compiled).
eth1 in the Linux Server is 3c509b
eth0 in the Linux Server is a via-rhine
eth0 in the Linux Workstation is an intel EtherExpress 100
The network card in the Win98 machine is also a 3c509b
net1 is 10Base2
net0 is 100BaseT
The satellite link works by providing a proxy service on the win98 machine. This proxy connects to a proxy at the satellite provider and
the replies then come in through the satellite. So, the satellite only provides the downstream while the upstream goes through my ISDN-ISP.
So, when i enable the satellite-link the linux-server sees a whole bunch of packets coming from the win98 and going out to the internet but
never sess a single reply. 
This seems to confuse Linux, because then i see ping times of about 600ms to 2000ms and packet drops beetwen the linux-server and 
the linux-workstation. That can only be solved by doing an ifconfig eth0 down / ifconfig eth0 up cycle. Then i see ping-times of around
0.9ms again.
This is very weird and i have no idea what i can change to make this running smoothly.
