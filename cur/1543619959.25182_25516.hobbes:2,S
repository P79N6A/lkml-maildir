Wouldn't it be trivial to use a zener diode with a rock-solid (i.e. as
ripple-free as possible) power supply? We'd have the randomness of the
electrons at our disposal. It's very easy to shield effectively. Of
course, this is a hardware issue...
I've been using zener diodes as white-noise generators for years for
meditation (I kid you not.) Had I used a RNG, I'd be totally insane by
now.
Cheerio!
