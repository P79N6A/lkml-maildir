The trick here is to:
1) keep some reserved pages around for PF_MEMALLOC tasks
   (we need this anyway)
2) set PF_MEMALLOC on the task you're killing for OOM,
   that way this task will either get the memory or
   fail (note that PF_MEMALLOC tasks don't wait)
This way the OOM-killed task will be able to exit quickly
and the rest of the system will not get killed as a side
effect.
regards,
Rik
