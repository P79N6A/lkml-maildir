> This is wonderful, but how is this related to ymfpci?
I don't know.  All I know is that _I_ did not enable persistent dma 
buffers in my kernel config, so I blamed this dmap stuff on ymfpci 
(which is the only sound option that I enabled).
I do see that CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT is enabled automatically
(perhaps by the OSS option).  Do you think this is what is requiring 
sound_alloc_dmap() ?
Thanks for all your help!
