Hi!
I already found a few more errors while trying to compile
2.5.20. I send you the patch as soon as I have successfully
compiled the kernel _without_ problems (hopefully today).
FYI. I do not compile very much options; The main options
I compile ('coz I need 'em and nothing more...):
SCSI:           QLogic ISP
Network:        DECchip Tulip (dc2114x) and Early DECchip
                Tulip (dc2104x)
Character Dev.: Support for console on serial port
Filesystems:    EXT3 support, no ReiserFS
Network FS:     NFS (as module)
Greetz,
   Oliver
