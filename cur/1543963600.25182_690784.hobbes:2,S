I wouldn't worry about it too much, it's not there in 2.6.26-rc1 as
far as I can tell.  And it may or may not have anything to do with the
fact that my system locked up about 60 seconds afterwards, before I
had a chance to login via X and do a suspend/resume cycle (since
that's the most reliable way to reproduce my regression).  I'm
travelling this week, but when I have time, I'll try disabling X,
doing a suspend/resume cycle, and then doing a kerenl build -j3 and
see if I can provoke your symptoms.
