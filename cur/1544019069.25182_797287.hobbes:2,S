Interesting...  Everything else aside, we have difference in e.g.
SYSCALL_DEFINE0 and SYSCALL_DEFINE3 behaviours: SYSCALL_DEFINE0(name)
will *not* do macro expansion in name and SYSCALL_DEFINE3(name, blah, ...)
will.
The reason is that we have name carried through extra layer of macros
in the latter case.  Argument is *NOT* a subject to expansion when it
is used with ##; however, passing it to another macro will expand it
just fine.
Regardless of the kludge with -D used by uml, I'd say that we want consistency
here; keeping the original behaviour would also be nice.
How about
#define SYSCALL_DEFINE1(name,...)    SYSCALL_DEFINEx(1, _##name, __VA_ARGS__)
etc.
with
#define SYSCALL_DEFINEx(x, name, ...)                                   \
        asmlinkage long sys##name(__SC_DECL##x(__VA_ARGS__))
?
That gives consistent behaviour in all cases and avoids the insane side
effects like this one.
