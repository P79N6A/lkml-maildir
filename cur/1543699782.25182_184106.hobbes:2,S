I'm sure many people will find this useful. Personally (and this is not 
intended as any sort of flame bait), I just want a way to get access to 
all raw bk changesets for a given project. All existing methods of 
getting information out of a bk repository either involve running bk 
yourself, or getting incomplete information. You have argued 
(succesfully) that the CVS export doesn't lose very much information, 
but an argument can be made that any information loss is too much. After 
all, the information I am talking about is simply what was put into the 
system by the developers in the first place.
