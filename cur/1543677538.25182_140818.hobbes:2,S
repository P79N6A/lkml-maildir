I tested swsusp ex 2.5 BK tree - it is is broken. 
Looks something like: Writing data to swap (2273 pages): .<3>bad: scheduling while atomic!
and call traces.
Have a look at the thread on LKML around June 4: 
IDE Power Management (Was: software suspend in 2.5.70-mm3)
I'll wait for Nigel's 2.5 port

My current linux related activities in rough order of priority:
- Testing of Swsusp for 2.4
- Learning 2.5 kernel debugging with kgdb - it's in the -mm tree
- Studying 2.5 serial and ide drivers, ACPI, S3
The 2.5 kernel could use your usage. More info on setting up 2.5 kernel at
