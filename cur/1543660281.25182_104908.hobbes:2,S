Given the probably effect of the steps on the cache, I think the
readability argument is a better one, particularly if you have more than a
few steps. There is an effect, but it's relatively small. But use of goto
need not be unreadable.
  if (step1() != ok) goto errex0;
  if (step2() != ok) goto errex1;
  if (step3() == ok) {
    if (step4() == ok) return OK;
    undo_step3();
  }
  undo_step2();
errex1:
  undo_step1();
errex0:
  /* in case there is something other than just return, jump here */
  return FAIL;
Less indenting, and the undo's falling through look visually like a switch
without the overhead.
I have not looked at the code this generates, it's a comment on human
readability rather than an actual implementation, and I'm sure someone
will argue that the first failure should just be a return if there's
nothing else which needs to be done. On the other hand the return inline
would be more bytes, so someone else can argue against.
