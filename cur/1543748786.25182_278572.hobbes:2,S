Now take a real laptop and the numbers are in the 20W (15A) range.

On a PC it makes huge sense, the deeply embedded folks who do turn the
thing off for 30secs at a time (Eg cellphone) also want it as do
virtualisation people where it trashes your scaling. API wise it isn't
too hard, its just a matter of time to convert the jiffies users away
and to do relative versions of add_timer with accuracy info included.
