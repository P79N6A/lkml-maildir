It would be interesting to do a CPU overhead benchmark to see how much
of the overhead is actually measurable on an x86 system.  If it's only
a small percent, it might be acceptable given that x86_64 machines are
going to be gradually taking over, and sector_t only exists if
CONFIG_LBD is enabled.  So for smaller systems where LBD isn't
enabled, we won't see performance overhead since sector_t won't exist
and so the code is going to have to use a typedef for ext2_blk_t which
is either __u32 or sector_t as necessary.

s_block_group_nr is *not* the number of block groups in the
filesystem.  As Takashi-san properly pointed out, the kernel
calculates the number of block groups by dividing the number of blocks
by the blocks_per_group fields.  s_block_group_nr is used to identify
the block group of a particular backup supeblock.  
So for the backup superblock located at block group #3,
s_block_group_nr 3, and for the backup superblock located at block
group #5, s_block_group_nr 5, and so on.  It is used only as a hint so
that prorams like findsuper and gpart can be more intelligent about
finding the start of filesystem, when trying to recover from a smashed
partition table.
