Subject: Why is hotplug a kernel helper?

If you don't mind me asking, I would like to know why the kernel calls
a usermode helper for hotplug events? Wouldn't a chrdev be a better
solution (especially considering that programs like magicdev could
listen in to it as well)? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the kobject
code never does check the return value from the usermode helper,
right?
