This has the disadvantage that it codifies the requirement of creating
the thread for the userlevel signaling ahead of time.  While this is a
valid implementation it is not the best (resource-wise) and doesn't
allow for optimizations.  Using a futex will allow to implement a scheme
where one single thread does the waiting for possibly many requests.
Imagine the benefits in case there are dozens of outstanding requests.
The additional system exit+entry isn't that expensive to justify
removing the flexibility.
