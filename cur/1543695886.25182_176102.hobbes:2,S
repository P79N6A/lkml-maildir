    Exactly the same for me...

    My problem is a bit different. I'm using 2.4.21, with an USB
mouse. I have 'input' built-in, and hid and mousedev as modules.
Well, if I do a cat /dev/mouse (c 13 32) or /dev/mice (c 13 63), I
always get ENODEV, unless I manually load hid and mousedev. The logs
doesn't say anything like 'cannot find driver for char-major-13' or
whatever. It just seems that 'mousedev' is never autoloaded :?

    But hotplugging is for connecting and disconnecting devices, not
for autoloading modules. I mean, if I access any char-major-13, and
the corresponding modules is not loaded, it should autoload :?
    The rest of devices in my system are properly autoloaded on
demand, but hid and mousedev are not :( Am I doing something wrong?

    Exactly... Anyway, if I build 'mousedev' into my kernel instead
of making it a module, should I do the same with 'hid' or
char-major-13 *is* autoloaded?
    Thanks a lot in advance. I'm missing on this subject...
