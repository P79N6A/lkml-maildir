I noticed a few weird things FTP installing rh5.2 on a box.
The problem however was on the "server". Whenever the
box was pulling data from the "server", the server became
irresponsive, typing lagged, mouse lagged horridly, and top
showed that the kernel was at times of datatransfer spending
60% of its time in the kernel.
This all happened on a 266PII with 2.2.1-ac5 installed.
The "client": 486DX2
