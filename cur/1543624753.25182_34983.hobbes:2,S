Looking more at this, I actually think that the _real_ fix is to call all
drivers exit functions at kernel shutdown, and not discard the exit
section when linking into the tree.
That, together with the device tree, automatically gives us the
_correct_ shutdown sequence, soemthing we don't have right now.
Anybody willing to look into this, and get rid of that __devexit_p()
thing?
