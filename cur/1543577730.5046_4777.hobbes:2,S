Hmm, ok. Well, I was reading the Changes document when doing this first
and did not use my head. This document advises to deduct the version
number from 'ls -l /lib/libc*'.
I will fix this so that ldconfig is used for the libraries. That
would be the best.
BTW, can you tell me what the console-tools are? They are checked in the
ver_linux script but I have never heard of them. Are they a replacement
for kbd?
Furthermore, is the name of RedHat's gcc for the kernel always 'kgcc'?
TIA,
 Matthias
