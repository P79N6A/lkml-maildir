notifier_chain_register_module() is possible, just pass __THIS_MODULE
and the code that runs the notifier chain does try_inc_mod_count()
before making the upcall.  But that new function cannot be mixed with
notifier_chain_register(), it has to be a complete replacement.  Not
going to happen in 2.4.
I considered making notifier_chain_register() a macro which called
notifier_chain_register_module() with __THIS_MODULE, but that assumes
that all calls to notifier_chain_register() are local, i.e. from the
top level functions.  Alas there are any service routines that call
notifier_chain_register() on behalf of their caller, so the macro
approach will result in the wrong value for __THIS_MODULE.

notifier_chain_unregister() is not a problem, that is a downcall from
the module into the kernel when the module is going away, downcalls are
"always" safe.  The race is a module that has started to unload, and
another cpu (or even the same cpu under some circumstances) runs the
notifier chain, doing an upcall from the kernel into a module without
locking or refcounts.  Given the right timing, the notifier code could
even branch to a module that has been completely removed.  Note that
notifier_call_chain() has no locking, so it is also racy against
notifier_chain_unregister().
