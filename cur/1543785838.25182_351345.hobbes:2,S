It is an approximation.  In my personal experience, the "-l80"
parameter is doing a lot of harm.  It causes things like
	if (...)
		for (...)
			while (...)
				if (...)
					for (...)
						while (...)
							some_function(argument,
									very_long_argument,
									another_argument,
									0,
									1,
									NULL
									);
Code with many indentation levels is pressed hard against the 80
column limit.  Such code needs manual cleanup anyway and the 80 column
thing makes manual cleanup harder instead of easier.  Without that,
Lindent is a big initial improvement.
It is not the final word. :)
