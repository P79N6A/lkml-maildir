Subject: using bitkeeper to backport subsystems?

I want to use/track the linuxconsole project (especially for its
Multi-desktop operation), which tracks 2.5 on the stable tree
2.4.
is bitkeeper the easiest way to go? i imagine the patch sets to
be like transformations, which can be superimposed, so i would
clone marcellos and linus tree, generate a linuxconsole patchset
against linus tree and backport it to marcellos tree. (there are
older backports, which should make my live easier.) 
I imagine that i had two 'transforms' now: first the linuxconsole
transform, which changes over time as the project (and the
kernel) moves on, and the backport transform, which i hope to
remain more static. Can i superimpose these transforms? Is this
how it works?
has anyone done this before? is there a howto or could someone
outline the bitkeeper steps needed? Any catches?
