..and it gets better. Not sure what the exact problem is (updated DRM, X
etc) but Fn-F8 (CRT/LCD) hardlocks. With the no-APIC kernel (same new
DRM and so forth) it just hesitates (not sure if it works or not,
haven't got a monitor handy.)  It worked (or at least didn't lock up)
when I initially tried it, but now I can reproduce it well before X
comes up.
Looks like it should be dropped from the whitelist :(  (To recap, this
is the Inspiron 8500 w/ A02 bios)
