Yeah vendors tend to like this idea, it's not just Veritas and QLogic
who went down this path, unfortunately.
Updating the flash does seem very easy, and the good thing about the
QLA adapters is that you can reflash even if you screwed up in the
first place. Yup I tried that ;) Writing the flash utility seems like
a piece of cake in this as well. What doesn't look as easy is to
figure out that directory structure of the firmware images ;-( Any
chance you got some data on that?
Cheers,
Jes
