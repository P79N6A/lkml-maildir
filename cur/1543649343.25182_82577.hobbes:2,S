You _should_ be able to run 2.4.2 in 4Mb, but as Alan pointed out,
there is no reason to stick with that old version just because of lack
of memory.  Exactly what problems are you having running 2.4.2 in 4Mb
anyway?  By the way, I am assuming that your embedded system is X86
based.  I have run all of the kernels I mentioned in my previous post
in swapless_ 4Mb on X86.
