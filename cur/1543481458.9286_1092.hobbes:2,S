'Hz' has a physical definition. The Linux HZ constant just says how many
timer interrupts per second should occur. The requirement is to never let
this (arbitrary) constant show up, but to have all API components use the
'real-world' definition of time.

not at all. The problem is that /proc/<pid>/stat (and other kernel
interfaces) export values that are dependent on the kernel-internal HZ
definition. They should export 'natural' units like nanoseconds or
microseconds, this solves the problem once for all, makes binary data
files exchangable between different-HZ Linux boxes, etc.
