On a VIA KT266a chipset motherboard with a standard IDE CD-ROM device I
get input/output errors on all iso9660 + joilet CD's. I don't have any
basic CDs to try.
On 2.4.10-2.4.16 it works fine. Am just about to test on 2.4.17 but
thought I would post this now. I am using the same .config from 2.4.10
in 2.5.1-dj8 if that helps.
