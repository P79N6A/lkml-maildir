Hi
I'm working on an embeded system with linux kernel 2.4.27 and busybox 
1.00. Lately I've decided to add hotplug feature to my kernel in order 
to automaticaly mount usb keys.
When I plug the usb key, I can see in the kernel debug that 
"/sbin/hotplug" is called but my script is not executed. I've tried to 
replace the hotplug script by a simple one but nothing appeared. Here is 
my script :
#!/bin/sh
echo "usb key un/plugged"
The script is working when I run it myself (./sbin/hotplug )
I've also noticed that when kmod try to call modprobe, it's not executed 
while the debug message says that everything went fine.
Can anyone help me ?
Thanks in advance.
Ben.
