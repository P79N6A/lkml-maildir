The ATI FBcon driver is an option that is enabled for i386 builds.  However the
comments in the source say that this is only for PowerMac.  Also there is no
documentation on this at all.
What is the status of this?  Is it something that will work on a PC with an ATI
card?  If so how?

I am in London and would like to meet any Linux users here.
I plan to work in London until April and then move to some other
place where the pay is good.
