Subject: 2.2.0-pre1 problem with paralell Zip drive.

After upgrading to 2.2.0-pre1 from 2.1.132 my paralell port zip drive
isn't working.  The printer, which is attatched to the same port,
still works fine.   The kernel config was the same, I just ran 'make
oldconfig' and declined all the new options.  
The relavent parts of the boot messages are:
<Linux argon 2.1.132 #1 Wed Dec 23 18:35:31 MST 1998 i586 unknown
>Linux argon 2.2.0-pre1 #2 Tue Dec 29 02:50:39 MST 1998 i586 unknown

Has anyone already tracked this down?
