Try a few more things.  Since you had entered /jail, you can view '/' by
looking at .. .  But if you look at /, you dereference your
task->fsroot.  You never changed that, so it points to the original
mount.  If however you 'ls ..', you should see your 'jail' directory.
However it won't have the /bin and /lib mounted because you didn't
	mount --rbind /jail /
What you really want to do is
	mount --bind /jail /jail
to make sure it's a mountpoint, then set up the new /jail using bind
mounts like you're doing (and likely some rbinds in some places), then
use pivot_root() to change your root.  Then umount2("/old_root",
MNT_DETACH).
