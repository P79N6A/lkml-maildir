What I don't understand is that if oldconfig is an interactive target,
why make it work when interactivity is not available? Also, if
silentoldconfig is an automated target, why make it abort when
interactivity is not available?
Just seems backwards.
For me, silentoldconfig could work, but I prefer the verbosity of
oldconfig. It's just more convenient. It's not that things are checked
in minute detail, but that our builds may eventually disappear (by
upgraded packages), but our build logs remain. It's the only way we have
to go back and check regressions in the build process (it has saved us
many times).
