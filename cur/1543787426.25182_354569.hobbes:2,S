>Hello, i use slack 10.1, kernel 2.6.14-rc2-git7, i have orinoco silver pcmcia wifi card, i compile PCMCIA support into kernel, and orinoco, hermes, orinoco_cs as modules.... after booting loading modules, and run /etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia i see message >= cardmgr no pcmcia in /proc/devices. after cat /proc/devices there is really no pcmcia. I really dont know what is it, on 2.6.11 with the same kernel conf, its works ok and pcmcia was in /proc/devices. So during i wont have pcmcia in /proc/devices i cant use cardctl and cardmgr ... any idea how to fix it ? where can be a problem ? thanks

Compile yenta, pcmcia, hermes and hermes pcmcia into kernel. I know
about this problem, but I haven't had enough time to solve it.
regards,
