The 3w-xxxx.c patch is definately bogus.  It would have applied against the driver
released about a year and a half ago, however both 2.4.26 & 2.6.6 don't need this 
patch since they just printk() a warning if tw_setfeature() fails on really old
3ware controllers.

I've been informed this is bogus (I myself don't understand what's going
on with this patch).

This unfortunately creates a duplicate entry in the unusual_devs.h

It's been suggested that the m68k people were withholding this in order
to come up with a better fix.
