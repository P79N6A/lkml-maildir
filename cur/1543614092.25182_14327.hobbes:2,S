fyi:  the complete patch against 2.4.16 (should work with little or no
modification against 2.4.17) is here:
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfs-perf/patches/
you'll need to apply inode2file.diff then nfs-odirect11.diff, and it
requires Trond's pathconf patch in order to be completely useful.
because O_DIRECT cannot do small I/O (must be a multiple of a block size),
does fsx work when using it?  can someone describe the failures?
