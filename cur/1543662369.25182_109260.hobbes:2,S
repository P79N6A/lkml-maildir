You're right, we're using English differently :-) I don't know what the 
above paragraph means. I can guess, but that's where the trouble is 
coming from. Based on the guessing:
    * Yes, LSM by itself does not enforce security policy.
    * Yes, the desing is to put hooks in front of important objects, and
      ask the modules if that access is ok.
The effect of this is to push security policy out to the modules. This 
is what Linus asked for, so that he would not have to maintain security 
policy or security policy engines.

You have often made this point about "for the Linux kernel's sake" vs. 
some other motivation, and it bothers me. It suggests that you somehow 
care about the Linux kernel more than I do. No, I care about the Linux 
kernel a lot. More over, I don't see how "who cares about the kernel 
more" is pertinent.
That aside, the Linux kernel per se is not some entity to be pleased 
like a stone god. Linux exists for its users. LSM is designed to benefit 
Linux kernel users. Some benefit by being able to add security features 
that they could not get before, because they are not capable of patching 
their own kernels. Some benefit by being able to produce experimental 
security modules without having to patch & track the Linux kernel. Some 
benefit by being able to unload security stuff and go for a leaner 
configuration.
LSM is not about pleasing a small number of module vendors. It is about 
benefiting a large number of potential users.
