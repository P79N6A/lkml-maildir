Alan and group,
	This patch, the combined work of:
	"B. D. Elliott"  <bde@nwlink.com>
	"Mike Galbraith" <mikeg@weiden.de>
At least temporarily fixes the problem with Linux initial ramdisk
support. However, it does not fix the problem with the loop-device
containing stale data if it is used a second time. The loop-device
needs to have its buffers invalidated when it is closed.
Can you put this into the next development kernel, please.
