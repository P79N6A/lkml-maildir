I rebooted my RHEL4-based ipv4/ipv6 gateway/server into 2.6.15-rc1, and 
very soon the box was brought to its knees, spewing
	VFS: file-max limit 400490 reached
with the resultant userspace breakage associated with that.  Data points:
* recent 2.6.14-git-recent works
* 2.6.15-rc1 fails
* besides the above error, the only other notable syslog item is 
complaints from radvd (ipv6 router advertisement daemon)
* past logs don't show this radvd error
* machine: Intel x86 HT SMP SATA e1000 8139too (kernel config attached)
So, my guess is that something broke in rtnetlink ipv6.
But I could be wildly wrong.  This might not have anything to do with 
the net stack at all.
