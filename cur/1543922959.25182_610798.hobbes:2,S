Sorry, I'm not sure how I can get these informations.
Can you please tell me what I should do?
I'll continue to dig the issue.
I also have the following message.
..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC + timer doesn't work! Try using the 'noapic' kernel parameter
It appeared only on 64bit and the 2nd kernel without
boot parameter noapic.
