I had the same issue with 2.6.1. Always under heavy disk activity. 
Turning on DMA support for my hard drive sovled the problem.
However, I've recently upgraded to 2.6.2-rc2 and the problem has reappeared.
This time, it is not linked to disk activity (DMA support is now enabled). 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/2199
 does not solve the problem.
Still investigating ...
Greetings,
Johann
ps: my kernel is not tainted.
