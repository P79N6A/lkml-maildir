Hi !
I'm running 2.4.x or 2.2.19 (2.4.x is fine but I experienced a bad Oops using
my hamradio packet radio system with it ... and nobody seems interested by my
reports .. sniff).
I would like to change my HDD.
My motherboard is a Asus P5A with a K6-2 500 (overcloked to 550hz .. in test).
The chipset is an Ali one.
What is a good choice for a new HDD for linux ?
Seagate, Barracuda ST330630A, 30.6 Go, 7200 t/min
IBM, DTLA-305020, 20.5 Go, UDMA 100
Western Digital, CAVIAR WD307AA, 30.7 Go
After seeing some messages related to the DMA behaviour of some disks together
with some chipsets with kernel 2.4, I would like some advices.

Best regards
