The patch applied was mingos timersync-2.2.10-A2 patch! A test run with
Andrea´s patch applied on a 2.2.12 kernel is on the way. I´ll report if
any problems are occuring. Both tests are without running xntpd,
because my machine crashed twice on Saturday (kernel 2.2.3, no oopses
displayed, no xntpd running) and I want to know wheter it is hardware or
it is really an smp race in the kernel.
Running ksymoops on the previous reported oops-message produces the
following output:
Using `/usr/src/linux/System.map' to map addresses to symbols.
