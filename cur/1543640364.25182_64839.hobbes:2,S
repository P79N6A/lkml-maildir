Hallo Paul Bristow,
I have tested ide-floppy on my Linux 2.4.19 with ATAPI ZIP 100. I am
using devfs.
I found following problem:
If module ide-floppy is loaded and no disc is present in the drive,
/dev/ide/host0/bus1/target1/lun0/disc entry is not created. Later
inserted media cannot be checked in any way, because no /dev entry
exists.
Older kernels have also this behavior.
Fix: Create .../disc entry in all cases, even if no disc is present.
