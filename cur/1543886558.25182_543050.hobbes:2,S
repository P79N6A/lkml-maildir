Hm, suggestive, but I'm not convinced.  Two differences to this situation:
   1. Immediately after the clone ("untar"), the contents are completely
      OK; it's only after a umount/mount cycle to problems appear
   2. There's no corruption as such; the files are just too short.  And
      it seems they're at a previously OK length, not some random size.
