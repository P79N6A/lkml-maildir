Subject: [LTP] Validating exact PASS and FAIL scenarios for LTP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi All,
It may be a little high time for us to visit the way LTP defines itś
PASS and FAILURES. We know that each of LTP Test cases reports certain
keywords. Now, we need to define properly how each of these Keywords
needs to be interpreted in context to the addition information these
test-cases report, so that, we can arrive at saying that:
1) this information means that TEST has passed (and in such scenario the
test-case is bound to exit(0) to pan), and,
2) That set of information means that the TEST has failed (and in such
scenario the test-case is bound to exit(non-zero) to pan)
There are several reported incidents where there is ambiguity in judging
whether the test is a PASS or FAIL. Now we have come to a point where we
need to discuss and debate this out and say that:
1) These are the situations where the test should report exit(0) to pan
irrespective of what it has reported to logs through INFO:, and,
2) These are the situations where the test should immediately terminate
with exit(non-zero) to pan.
We also need to decide where these keywords like
PASS
WARN
BROK
FAIL
RETR
CONF
INFO
should be placed, and under what context ??
I hope all of you will contribute to this debate, where we finally seal
LTP´s fate as a:
1) Broken test-suite, or,
2) a glorious one.
--Regards--
Subrata
