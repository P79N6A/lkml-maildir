OK; In which case, it might help to provide some explanation as to why
you think that Ron Guilmette is "committing an act of criminal fraud,
computer misuse and a few other violations".
The existence of Michael Warfield's message suggests that I wasn't the
only one who felt that it seemed to be the other way around. For
anyone whose knowledge of this issue is limited to what has appeared
in this thread, all we have to go in is Ron's email, as posted by
Keith Owens.
