That would be currently true. However I need it to be stricter.
I'm wanting to do networked swap. And in order to be able to receive
writeout completions when in the PF_MEMALLOC region I need to introduce
a new network state. This is because it needs to operate in a steady
state with limited (bounded) memory use.
Normal network either consumes memory, or fails to receive anything at
all.
So this new network state will allocate space for a packet, receive the
packet from the NIC, inspect the packet, and toss the packet when its
not found to be aimed at the VM (ie. does not contain a writeout
completion).
So the total memory consumption of this state is 0 - it always frees
what it takes, but the memory use is non 0 but bounded - it does
temporarily use memory, but will limit itself to never exceed a given
maximum)
Because the network stack runs on the slab allocator in generic (both
kmem_cache and kmalloc) I need this extra guarantee so that a slab
allocated from the reserves will not serve objects to some random
non-critical application.
If this is not restricted this network state can leak memory to outside
of PF_MEMALLOC and will not be stable.
So what I need is:
  kmem_cache_alloc(s, gfp) to fail when alloc_page(gfp) fails
agreeing on the extra condition:
  when kmem_cache_size(s) <= PAGE_SIZE
and the extra note that:
  I only really need it to fail for ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS, the other
  levels like ALLOC_HIGH and ALLOC_HARDER are not critical.
Which ends up with:
  if the current gfp-context does not allow ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS
allocations, and alloc_page() fails, so must kmem_cache_alloc(s,) if
kmem_cache_size(s) <= PAGE_SIZE.
(yes this leaves jumbo frames broken)
