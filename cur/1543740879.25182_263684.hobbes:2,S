Subject: [PATCH][2.4] ELF fixes for executables with huge BSS (0/2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I have ported the following two patches (from 2.6.x and the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 3 kernel) to kernel 2.4.27 and up. The first patch
fixes a segfault that I've seen with Fortran programs that have huge
statically allocated arrays. The second patch, it seems to me, is a
further fix that is necessitated by the first patch.
[PATCH] fix ELF exec with huge bss

[PATCH] binfmt_elf.c fix for 32-bit apps with large bss
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@407afc8e4kEZSl4pklf3Ptrl2ZzkeA
I will post the patches as replies to this e-mail. If it's too
late to include them in 2.4.28, then I would appreciate if they
could be added to the queue for 2.4.29. Thanks!
