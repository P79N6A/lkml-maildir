Andrew,
I am still thinking about your patch.  I will run some tests today using
2.6.2-mm1 to see if the problem is fixed.  My 8-proc machine ran
overnight with 6 copies of the read_under running without problems with
my original patch.  Previously on the 8-proc machine, it would hit
uninitialized data within an hour.
The concern I have is that DIO needs filemap_write_and_wait() to
make sure all previously dirty pages have been written back to
disk before the DIO is issued.
If __block_write_full_page() can possibly clear PageWriteback 
with buffer i/o still in flight (even for WB_SYNC_NONE) then
a subsequent filemap_write_and_wait() will miss that page.
For example, I previously tried:
        do {
                get_bh(bh);
+		if (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYCN_NONE)
+              		 wait_on_buffer(bh);
                if (buffer_mapped(bh) && buffer_dirty(bh)) {
                        if (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_NONE) {
                                lock_buffer(bh);
and this still saw uninitialized data.
Also, if __block_write_full_page() can redirty a page wouldn't this
allow filemap_write_and_wait() to return with page still dirty that
DIO needs written back?
	 
I'll work on updating the other patches.
