--text follows this line--
I have uploaded PPSkit-0.4.1.tar.gz on
ftp://pcphy4.physik.uni-regensburg.de/pub/wiu09524/PPS.
 I'd like
people to try that version, especially as a new Linux-2.2 is to come
out very soon, and the scheduling code has been changed between
2.1.131 and 2.1.132, possibly affecting things.
In case people worry what it is, here's the LSM entry:

And here's the relevant part from the NEWS file:
                            NEWS for 0.4.1
+ Merged changes into Linux 2.1.132.  ``N_PPSCLOCK'' had to be changed
  in ``asm/termios.h'' again; the current value is ``13'' now.
  Revised ``Documentation/kernel-time.txt'' to correct the outdated
  interface description.  Added missing patch for
  ``include/asm-sparc/termios.h''.
+ Notes from the merge: ``N_MASC'' (8) and ``N_R3964'' (9) are missing
  in ``include/asm-{alpha,i386,m68k,mips,sparc64}/termios.h''
+ Updated ``enable_pps.c'' to work even if ``STA_UNSYNC'' is set.
  Numerous related changes to improve the usefulness.  Fixed bug when
  ADJ_SINGLE_SHOT should be used.
Enjoy,
Ulrich
