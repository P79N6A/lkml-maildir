This particular case was intentional: -ENOMEM really is the right return 
code when the ring cannot be allocated.  Mixing it up with the potential 
return codes from do_mmap or other functions might result in a very 
nonsensical return.  Perhaps someone can provide an arguement in favour 
of propagating the value, but I think it really can only mean "you asked 
the kernel to allocate too much memory or did something stupidly buggy with 
threads".  Cheers,
