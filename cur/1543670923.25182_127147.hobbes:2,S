Yes. I did apply the patches... Just not to the kernel I booted ;(
Here is the correct tree I see on my 2xPIII:
/sys/class
|-- cpu
|   |-- cpu0
|   |   `-- device -> ../../../devices/sys/cpu0
|   `-- cpu1
|       `-- device -> ../../../devices/sys/cpu1
|-- input
|-- scsi-host
`-- tty
    |-- console0
    |   `-- dev
    |-- ptmx0
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pty0
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pty1
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pty10
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pty100
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pty101
