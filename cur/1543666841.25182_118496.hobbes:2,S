You could be hitting the same problems I saw a few weeks back.
Short: There were a *lot* of bogus UDP packets being transmitted.
Trond took a look at a tcpdump log of bad traffic and found there
were all sorts of silly things in there like oversized frames etc.
I've not had time to look into this since then, but also see strange
effects of this bug like failing md5sums after copying over NFS.
