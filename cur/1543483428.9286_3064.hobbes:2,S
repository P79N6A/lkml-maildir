Probably what would be a much better use of this bandwidth would be for
someone to volunteer idle cycles on their Whizzbang 1000 Intel box as
a compile server for the latest & greatest.  It sure seems like this
would be useful and you could make a combination of config files and
built kernels & modules available for ftp.  Somebody should talk to
lma@varesearch.com about this.
