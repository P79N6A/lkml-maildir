The proper name would be something like kill_all_info().  As we are
talking about the group of all processes.
I am sitting here wondering why we bother to ignore init, as init
is protected from all signals it doesn't explicitly setup a signal
handler for.  It is probably worth taking a quick look at the common
shutdown scripts and sysv init and see if anything actually cares if
we simply remove the is_init check.
The only two signals I know that are commonly handled this way
are kill(-1, SIGTERM) and kill(-1, SIGKILL);
And a very quick look at sysvinit-2.86 shows that it doesn't setup a
handler for SIGTERM.  So I believe we can delete we can delete
the is_init check entirely without changing anything and with a less
surprising if anyone ever cares.

And that part is basically what we have now, just reshuffled.
