My Samsung X05 requires vbetool to resume from suspend-to-ram properly. Up
to 2.6.14, vbetool-0.3 worked fine; the PageReserved patch broke this (as
reported). Also the new package by Dave {Miller,Jones} didn't help and does
not help, even with these new 11 patches. Using the unmodified, original
vbetool-0.3, though, does work as expected, and I can resume back into X
again.
kernel			vbetool-0.3	vbetool-0.3+lrmi-patch
--------------------------------------------------------------
2.6.14			+		?
2.6.15-rc1		-		-
2.6.15-rc1+patches	+		-
However -- and this is the first time I'm experiencing this bug, I now got
this in my dmesg right after the last resume from sleep.

... and so on. Don't know whether this is related... and it isn't
reproducible.
