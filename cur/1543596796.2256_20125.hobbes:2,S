correct.

yes, but it's not discontigmem issue, it is the other way around (page
structure is valid but it maps to non ram, like the 640k-1M region that
we have the page structure for, we don't use discontigmem for it because
the hole is too smalle, but it is non ram, or also normal ram mapped by
some device as dma region).
