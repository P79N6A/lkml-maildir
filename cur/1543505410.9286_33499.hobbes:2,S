Alan,
The GI SB1000 "Surfboard" driver and/or ppp is malfunctioning under pre7.
I dropped back to my "golden" copy of the sb1000 driver and this _still_
failed to bring it to life - so it's not in your edits.
Symptoms are:
- driver installs and displays banner.
- ifconfig shows the cm0 and ppp0 interfaces.
- route command hangs..
Here's what it normally looks like when the connection is up (under
2.2.10-ac4):
Kernel IP routing table

Under 2.2.11pre7, only the first line displays regardless of how long I
wait. 
- the interface does not appear under /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf (normally
has entries of cm0 in the appropriate places).
- no packet count ever shows for cm0 under ifconfig.
- ppp0 shows an expected number of packets coming and going while the ppp
handshaking is going on.  Log messages indicate a successful ppp
authentication and negotiation.
- the only sign of life from the sb1000 is in /proc/interrupts, where
there's an indication that it tried to communicate with us!
I went back to 2.2.10-ac4 to post this, and all's well.
Any ideas?
Steve
