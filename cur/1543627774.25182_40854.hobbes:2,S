Thats a legal question about derivative works again. Its a lawyer question.
Don't ask lawyers how to program, don't ask programmers how the law works 8)
In business terms a binary only driver means that it won't be considered for
the mainstream kernel and you will need to rebuild it for every exact kernel
version your customers want. Irrespective of the GPL/lib question it may be
helpful to provide your customers source code to the kernel part of the
driver if only so you don't have to keep recompiling it. VMware follows very
much this model - their kernel bits are source code, vmware itself is most
definitely proprietary and per copy licensed.
