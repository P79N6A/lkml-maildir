Well, for me it's a small script running at boot time. So, there's no
pain at all, unless planning or thinking in advance qualifies as pain ;-).
Seriously, this is a first cut. If there is real demand, I'll try to
come up with something. But I think, this will be a job for system
administrators or distribution builders. So, maybe a shell script with
fixed permissions will be sufficient. We will see.
First of all, I want to see, wether people like it at all or come up
alternative ideas.
Regards, Olaf.
