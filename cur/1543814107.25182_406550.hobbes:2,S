Whereas on EM64T I found the opposite,
reverting just the stub_execve hunk still behaved badly.
I've double-checked that finding since, built and ran another
kernel to confirm it.  But your Athlon64 still works OK that way?
Just trying to clarify - I don't think we're in any rush to
settle it now that Linus has reverted the damage from his tree.
