On VMS record I/O isn't a kernel issue anyway.  RMS is a library -- the
only I/O syscall is SYS$QIO[W] which just moves blocks.  RMS also handles
the fancy locking needed by simple transaction systems.  Only the locking
primitives themselves are kernel functions.  On days when I feel like
offending thousands at a stroke, I toy with the idea of writing an 
RMS-like library for Unix. :-)

I'm one of the few people I know who used RMS on TOPS-20, too.
