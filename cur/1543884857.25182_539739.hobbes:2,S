System is up and running perfectly now, it is routing everything at
about 200 mbps now with only 5% load avg with the above changes to
arp.c
So the real question now is, why is this number so low by default?
It would probably be much better if this could be handled dynamically
in the kernel.

Its a Juniper M7i
It comes default with a 5400 rpm laptop 2.5" harddrive but now we
bought a more robust "server" 2.5" harddrive. It still barfs on the OS
install, so the linux is doing all the job now. Will get a juniper guy
to come and fix :)
As a side note, i'm starting to wonder if it was worth the $20k when i
could just have a linux machine to do the job with a clone for backup
;)
