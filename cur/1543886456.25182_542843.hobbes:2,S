Just because you limit yourself to 80 chars minus "ls -l"-clutter, this is
no reason why I shouldn't use long filenames. If I need to handle these
filenames, I can enlarge the terminal window or read the next line.
E.g.: I have a music file named "artist - title.ext", where the artist
name is 103 characters long, using abbreviations. In order to enter that
name, I have to press seven keys, including the escape character.
There is nothing unreasonable in using that name.
If I could not use these filenames, I'd have to use e.g. numbers instead of
filenames and a database containing the mapping from name to number,
duplicating the function of a directory. That's bullsh... . You should rather
bump NAME_MAX and, if you are concerned about legacy applications, make it
optional. Having some names to be illegal becaue of their length on a
filesystem not allowing command.com metacharacters is not a problem.
