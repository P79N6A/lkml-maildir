please solve it slightly differently: introduce a uniformly usable 
reboot_force flag, that will always default to the constant of 1 if 
!X86_64 && !X86_BIOS_REBOOT. That makes the code cleaner - and not the 
least i can also merge the fix earlier in the series, without having to 
redo the big smp.c movement patch :-)
