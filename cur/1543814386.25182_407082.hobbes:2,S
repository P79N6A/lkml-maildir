What's PORT_INTERNAL?  ethtool doesn't appear to define that.
drivers/net/natsemi.c: In function `netdev_set_ecmd':
drivers/net/natsemi.c:2989: `PORT_INTERNAL' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/net/natsemi.c:2989: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/net/natsemi.c:2989: for each function it appears in.)
