From the DU4.0d 'flock' manpage:
  The flock() function operates on the local system only.  It does not make
  any attempt to coordinate a file's lock status with other systems.  In a
  distributed environment, use the fcntl() or lockf() interfaces to place
  advisory locks on files, as they provide a superset of flock() features.
AIX has no manpage for 'flock' that I could find...
Solaris does indeed seem to support flock over NFS, but I dunno how
they solve the problem of a child process inheriting the lock. NLM was
not designed with 'flock' in mind, and assumes that a single process
owns the lock.
Cheers,
  Trond
