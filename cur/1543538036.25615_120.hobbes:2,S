Because we have (gasp!) empirical measurements that the preemption
point approach works to satisfy the performance characteristics we've
outlined. 
Thats why we (the original signees of the letter) were interested in
finding out more about the objections to Ingo's patches.

Except that we've had, in your words "excellent explanations that this
is by definition asking for hard RT". So if the problem really has
been ACKed, which I think I accept it has, and if there is really some
sense that it should be solved, which there might be, doesn't this
imply, in your own words, that Linux has to incorporate hard real-time ?

More accurate, I think, to say "purely aesthetic grounds". Its easy to
demonstrate that Ingo's patches work extremely well. The dispute is
over what they would do to the kernel in terms of design and/or
maintainance.

It wouldn't suprise me either. Ingo pulled a rabbit out of a hat the
last time, and I would judge him quite capable of extracting the TGV
from a thimble if he tries it again.
