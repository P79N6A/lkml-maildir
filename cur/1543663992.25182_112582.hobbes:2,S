that is a feature, it guarantees highmem unfreeable allocations like
pagetables can't eat all your normal zone. You can reduce the 200MB with
this boot command:
	lower_zone_reserve=256,256
As to decrease the swapping I just told you how to do that tweaking
vm_mapped_ratio.

the theory was that rmap would reduce the cpu utilization but of course
the patch don't do juts rmap.
