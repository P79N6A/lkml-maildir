Subject: Re: [RESEND PATCH 02/10] ide-floppy: move ide-floppy struct and macro defs into its own header. While at it

Hi,
Hmm, contrary to ide-cd.c case there doesn't seem to be a need currently for
moving code out of ide-floppy.c (and this patch series doesn't change that).
Besides it would be better to just remove some structs like it has been done
with i.e. struct atapi_capabilities_page in ide-cd.c case [1] because:
* it is easier to audit/debug the code if you don't have to look at typedefs
  all the time just to see which bytes/bits the code is really accessing
* not using typedefs will make the source code significantly smaller
* documentation is publically available
* these structs are not memory mapped

Please try to not mix things like moving code around and doing actual
changes because it makes patch review difficult (i.e. it took me quite a
while to find "old crufty code" that has been removed)...
Sometimes having more "trivial" patches is better...

typedefs are evil (exceptions are rare) and should die :)

as mentioned earlier it would be best to just remove these structs/typedefs
[ respective structures are described in SFF-8070i spec, it is useful to audit
  the final code against the spec to catch potential coding mistakes early ]

Well, it was already removed, the patch is in IDE tree (and thus in -mm).
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.24-rc6/2.6.24-rc6-mm1/broken-out/ide-mm-ide-floppy-remove-dead-code.patch
If possible please base your patches against IDE tree or the latest -mm patch.

[ not in -mm yet ]
Please rework/resubmit this patch (preferably splitted on few smaller ones).
