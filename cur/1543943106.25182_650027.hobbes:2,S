Hmm..  hadn't realized that.  I'm open to suggestions on how to do this
better.  The real reason why the synchronization is there is to make
sure that only one client is using the device at a time, using the
is_open flag.

What is preferred?

The physical device only generates/accepts complete words, the intention
is to account for the possibility that a read does not read complete
words, and to fulfill the read whenever possible.
It's arguable that read() and write() should not accept or return
partial words, I suppose

no idea.  even if it is, it's unlikely that the of_driver probing is
protected by the same lock as the platform_driver probing.

I thought I had been.... hmm... looks like a few other things to fix
there, too.
