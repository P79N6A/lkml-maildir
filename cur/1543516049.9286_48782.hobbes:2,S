Hi,
o The kernel is 2.3.28  (sorry for the typo in the previous message).
o The video card is (as reported by SuperProbe) :
	First video: Super-VGA
	Chipset: S3 Vision868 (PCI Probed)
	Memory:  1024 Kbytes
	RAMDAC:  S3 86C716 SDAC 15/16/24-bit DAC w/pixel-mux w/clock-PLL
	(with 6-bit wide lookup tables (or in 6-bit mode))
o zgv is v3.0
o Kernel is compiled with :
	#
	# Console drivers
	#
	CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
	CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
	# CONFIG_MDA_CONSOLE is not set
	#
	# Frame-buffer support
	#
