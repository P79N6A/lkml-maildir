Yes, _we_ all know that. However, it's not really intuitive to the user
getting a 'No such file or directory' on a script he just created. Bash
doesn't say:
bash: testscript: Script interpreter not found
but bash says:
bash: testscript: No such file or directory
Maybe we should create a new errno: EINTERPRETER or something like that and
let the kernel return that instead of ENOENT.
Note that this has little to do with the \r\n problem but only with the
_real_ underlying reason: the script interpreter is not found and ENOENT is
returned confusing the user: the user thinks the _script_ is not found,
while its there, for sure.
