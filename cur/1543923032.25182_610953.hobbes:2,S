it's not about lockdep; what this code doing is not valid use of a
mutex:
A mutex is required to have a clear process as owner, and in this case
it doesn't have that... at all. This is a violation of the kernel mutex
semantics.. and should be fixed.

the preferred method is to not use a mutex like this...
