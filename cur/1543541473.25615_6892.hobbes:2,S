I just did a traceroute to microsoft.com because I was
experiencing extreme delays connecting to about 50% of the sites
I tried.  I got back:
2 root@asdf:~# traceroute -m 255 microsoft.com
traceroute: Warning: microsoft.com has multiple addresses; using 207.46.130.45

I checked out MANY other sites as well, and all of them did 
the exact same thing.  This looks very bad.  My guess is the
Jim Berkland earthquake predictions were accurate.  Haven't
seen anything on TV though, even CNN hasn't mentioned anything.
Can't get anywhere useful online to find out either.  ;o(
Definitely some sand in the oil going on somewhere.
