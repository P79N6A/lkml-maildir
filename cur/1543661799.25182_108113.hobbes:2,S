Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.59: scanf to honor field widths for numerics

This is a fix to bug #189, vscanf/scanf ignoring field_widths for
numerical arguments.
Please review for inclusion.
It follows the same semantics as glibc, where '-', '0x', and '0' are
included in the field_width.
I've attached it to not make this message cluttered.
