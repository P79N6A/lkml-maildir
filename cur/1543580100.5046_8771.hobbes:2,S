Hi,
   I'm seeing similar problems with my system on 2.4.1-pre10.  This is an
AMD Thunderbird 900, MSI K7T Pro2-A mobo w/VIA KT133 chipset, UP, ide/scsi
mix.  2.4.1-pre10 works fine if I don't configure ACPI.  I'll try to
narrow down when this problem started showing up later today, as I
initially moved from 2.4.1-pre3 straight to 2.4.1-pre10.
