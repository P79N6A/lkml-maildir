Still when enabling tcq via 'echo using_tcq:8 > /proc/ide/hda/settings'  doing 
a simple 'bk clone' of the 2.5 repository will frag the newly created files 
uttlery. Lots of unconnected inodes and illegal directory entries on reboot. 
Filesystem is ext2. Enabling tcq and doing light work, watching movies, using 
mozilla, ... seems to work fine - but my home directory is on nfs, so it's no 
real test for my system disk.
When disabling tcq after boot, nothing of this happens.
Increasing the queue size to 32 seems to speed things up (no reliable numbers 
here). Complete system info at 
http://lx.sfhq.hn.org/.
 
Can I somehow debug tcq?
