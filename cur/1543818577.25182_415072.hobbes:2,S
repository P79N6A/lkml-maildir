Hi,
we have a big problem with the nfsd.
Our system is running SuSE SLES 9 SP2 (AMD64)on
6 Sun X4100 (1 Opteron 275, 4GB RAM, 1 *QLA2340)
All machines are connect via SAN to a EMC CX700.
Software installed SuSE SLES 9 SP2, kernel 2.6.5-7.191-smp
which is required for the GFS (Adic StorNEXT 2.6.1)
and also for EMC Powerpath to access the lun's.
After 8 to 80h one (not allways the same)
of the NFS server is starting to increase
the load from 0 -> ~7.5.
The system is not exporting any file system.
The system can be accessed using ssh.
Files CAN be seen, created and delete on the machine
locally.
The nfsd can't not be stopped and taking all of the
cpu time.
The load is rather small.
Only solution is a hard reboot for the node.
dmesg shows nothing, neither messages.
fuser will not work (hanging)
a) How can I get more information ?
b) What are save settings for the nfsd ?
Any hint is welcome !!
Please send answers as cc to my private address, I'm not
