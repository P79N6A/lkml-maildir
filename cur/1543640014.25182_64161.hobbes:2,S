I don't make that argument - mconfig is the superior solution by far -
but it is certainly the path of least resistance.
As pertains to CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL and " (EXPERIMENTAL)", it *is*
possible to add such a feature to the shell-based parsers by changing
the syntax slightly - specifically to lose the '$' on dependencies.
Changing the syntax *does* have ramifications when it means adapting
three separate parsers, but it can be done.

It would have been a big change and a big flag day, and among other
problems, the rulebase conversion issue was handled wrong.  Eric
refused to start from a 1-1 equivalent rulebase, preferring to tweak
the rulebase as he went along - partly just to fix bugs, partly to
show off his new capabilities.  Unfortunately, without the
apples-to-apples comparison, many people distrusted the new system,
superior though it was in many ways.
This is the primary lesson to be learned from CML2.  Anyone trying to
redesign a subsystem such as the kernel config system needs to keep it
in mind.  (Yes, I know from the rest of your message that you learned
it.)
