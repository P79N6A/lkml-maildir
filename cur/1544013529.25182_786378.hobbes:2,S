Is there a way using md/dm/lvm etc to make the source partition R/O and
replay the journal onto a CoW snapshop?  Admittedly, not easy to do inside
the 'mount' command itself, but at least it might be workable for LiveCD R/O
mounts and forensics work, where you can *tell* beforehand that's what you
want and can jump through setup games before doing the mount...
