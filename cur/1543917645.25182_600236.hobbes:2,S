Kristian and Pieter, does this simple duplication of the ioctl make
sense on its own?  AFAIU rawiso's iso packet buffers look different from
fw-cdevs's. It seems to me as if rawiso always put the cycle into a user
buffer for each iso packet received...
raw1394.h::struct raw1394_iso_packet_info {
	__u32 offset;
	__u16 len;
	__u16 cycle;   /* recv only */
	__u8  channel; /* recv only */
	__u8  tag;
	__u8  sy;
};
raw1394.c::raw1394_iso_recv_packets()
	/* copy the packet_infos out */
	for (i = 0; i < upackets.n_packets; i++) {
		if (__copy_to_user(&upackets.infos[i],
				   &fi->iso_handle->infos[packet],
				   sizeof(struct raw1394_iso_packet_info)))
			return -EFAULT;
		packet = (packet + 1) % fi->iso_handle->buf_packets;
	}
...while the Juju ABI returns the cycle only for those packets whose
fw_cdev_iso_packet.control had the FW_CDEV_ISO_INTERRUPT flag set.
The cycle is then written out in the fw_cdev_event_iso_interrupt event
which happens when this particular packet was received.  Right?
Pieter, do applications like yours need the cycle counter only for a few
predetermined packets or for each and every packet?
