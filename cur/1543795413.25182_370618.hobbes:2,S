Good catch.

any_online_cpu(cpu_online_mask) is a bit of a tautology.  How about
first_cpu(cpu_online_mask)? In fact, I'd prefer a new macro altogether
which you can then define to zero on UP.
This patch raises an interesting question actually.  What happens
when the CPU that's designated to run single-threaded wq's gets
removed?
Cheers,
