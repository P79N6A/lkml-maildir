I don't know whether you can easily determine page_mapcount with
page_count and flags, though (count gives you an educated guess,
but mapcount is the real thing).
page_mapcount sounds very reasonable to export. It is directly
tied with the userspace concept of mapping pages. page_count doesn't
seem very useful (and if you must have it, please use page_count),
neither does page flags.
You could have a bit indicating whether the page is free or not (but
that doesn't tell you much that meminfo or zoneinfo or buddyinfo does
not). Dirty/writeback/referenced/uptodate maybe?... I'm stumped,
what's flags for?
