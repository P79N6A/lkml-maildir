  Guess there aren't very many after all.  A quick grep through the block
  drivers found the DAC960, which does what you pointed out:
	spin_unlock(&io_request_lock);
	sleep_on(&Controller->CommandWaitQueue);
	spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
This problem was previously noted and has already fixed in the 2.2.5 driver,
which I will be merging into 2.3.99pre shortly.
