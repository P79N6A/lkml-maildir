besides the cache arguments Arjan raised, you are also corrupting SSE
registers big way. You are saving/clearing/restoring the TS but that's
not enough - what if e.g. a pagefault happened while userspace code
executed SSE code? You are corrupting those registers.
check out raid6_before_sse()/raid6_after_sse() how to write proper SSE
code for the kernel.
