You can get the same effect by doing kill(0, SIGINT) inside a handler
for SIGINT.  All you seem to be saying is "if you behave stupidly then
bad things happen to you".  I don't see that this example exposes any
bug or vulnerability in the kernel.

You had to go to some trouble to get this effect - you had to use an
asm statement to change the stack pointer, which is well and truly
into "undefined behaviour" territory, and so you deserve all you
get. :)  It's a very contrived example IMHO.
