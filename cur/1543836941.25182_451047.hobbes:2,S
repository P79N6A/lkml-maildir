The only effect of the user visibility of this option with SMP=n is that 
the user might choose a higher value resulting in wasted space.
We do already have a big amount of options, there's no reason for 
showing more than required.

For -mm, it might make even more sense defaulting to 57344 for getting a 
better testing coverage.
This would give a good feedback of both space usage problems and the 
timing behavior of all the
    for (i = 0; i < NR_IRQS; i++)
loops in the kernel.

So let's default NR_CPUS to 255 and NR_IRQS to 57344?
It's also silly if the defaults waste space (and time) for the majority 
of users.

The common x86_64 SMP machine for sale today is a dual core desktop.
More than 224 IRQs are an exceptional case, and we can expect people 
building such systems to know what they are doing.

Defaults are not for distributions.
Distribution maintainers are expected to set such options not depending 
on the defaults but depending on the needs of their users.
Depending on whether the distribution targets only desktop users, or 
whether the primary target are big servers, 4096 might be wrong in any 
direction.
