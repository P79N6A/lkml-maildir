DRM depending on `AGP=n' is driving me crazy! How to make CONFIG_DRM not
eligible for selection on platforms that do not have AGP?
Since many of the core DRM files depend on PCI, add a dependency on PCI,
to minimize the damage.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
