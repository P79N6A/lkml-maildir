I really don't understand what could be causing this, but it happens on
several machine and at least on kernels 2.4.22, 2.4.25, 2.4.26.
NFS v3 : hard, udp, rsize=8192,wsize=8192
local filesystems are XFS
Trond, this is data corruption not dropped packets so the protocol
being UDP is not the problem.
Here is what is happening :
Copying a file of offsets from machine A to machine B over NFS and then
comparing the file on B with the file on A over NFS, the file on machine B
is corrupted in the following ways. 
Usually, data earlier in the file will show up again later.
For example :
57344 bytes of data from 672190464-672247807 is also in positions
1449664512-1449721855
sometimes, data later in the file is dupped to a position before it
should be
53248 bytes of data from 1197158400-1197211647 is also in positions
1036660736-1036713983
Any ideas
Andy
