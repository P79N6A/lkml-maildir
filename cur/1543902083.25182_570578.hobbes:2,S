Subject: [RFC/T PATCH 00/12] lockdep: annotate lock_page
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/17/313

These patches are only for the brave!
I have not even tried to compile without lockdep support, one can have
