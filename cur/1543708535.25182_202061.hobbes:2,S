Fair comment. Fine granularity with percentages would require decimal
points and a function in the kernel to parse that value - maybe I could
get around to doing that. But I suppose ppm could certainly be used. We
just chose rational numbers to start with.

The task is removed from the runqueue and a timer is scheduled to put it
back onto the runqueue. The delay period is the required amount of time
for that task's usage to decay to below its cap.

Good point. We'll have to rethink background priorities.
