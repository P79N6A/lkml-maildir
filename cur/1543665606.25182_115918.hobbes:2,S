The *problem* was translation, the proposed *solution* was using the BIOS
values in preference to drive values would include capacity. Or I misread
the intent (or code).
I would think that the capacity should code from the drive, if the BIOS
geometry is clearly wrong from that capacity (no, I didn't define that)
then using it will/may cause problems in applications and perhaps the
kernel, although LBA should be used and geometry not an issue.
Feel free to read the original post otherwise, I thought using the BIOS
data was the intent, period.
