The only user of count_partial is in slab_objects() which is in a 
section that is
#if defined(CONFIG_SYSFS) && defined(CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG)
There should be no use if CONFIG_SYSFS is not set. I think we get a 
warning about a function that is never called when compiling the current 
mm code without SLUB_DEBUG or CONFIG_SYSFS (because the slab defrag use 
has not been merged yet).
In mm count_partial() is always defined. In Linus tree count_partial() 
comes just before slab_objects().
