OK. I don't really know the code, but I trust you ;)

Ah, I see. I missed that.
OK, well rather than make it weak, and have everyone except
i386 override it, can you just ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM?
After that, I guess most other architectures wouldn't even
use the function. Maybe it can go into lib/ instead so that
it can be discarded by the linker if it isn't used?
