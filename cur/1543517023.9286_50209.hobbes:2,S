There is no netscapes on those machines... Even X Windows are run for
several minutes only on big holidays :)) They are servers and development
machines which are not used for running Netscape on playboy.com... And they
did work perfectly until the processors and motherboards had been exchanged
for the faster ones...
BTW, that our long-standing NS with 2.1.125 is running on a 2 x P-II/400
machine which all the newer kernels don't like to run on.

I'd like to. But it's very hard to find such a bug ...

I do _ALWAYS_ build any kernel with _ALL_ possible options (which do make
sence) enabled and all possible drivers modularized. You know, I don't build
specific kernels for my machine, I do it for the distribution :)) That's why
I do hit almost every mistake in kernel sources... And that's why I don't
need any randomizers to test _SOME_ set of kernel options - I do test them
_ALL_ every time. Sure I can miss some errors when module FOO is requested
and BAR is disabled or vice versa , but it's not my goal to find such an
error...
