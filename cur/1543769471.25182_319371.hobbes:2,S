ipt_ULOG fails to load starting from 2.6.12-rc4-mm1 with the following
error message:
FATAL: Error inserting ipt_ULOG (/lib/modules/2.6.12-rc4-mm1-2/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_ULOG.ko): Cannot allocate memory
rc3-mm3 works fine.
Unfortunately, I wont have time to do a binary search till the weekend,
but I hope you'll point suspicious patch(es) without it.
Any additional info available by request.
