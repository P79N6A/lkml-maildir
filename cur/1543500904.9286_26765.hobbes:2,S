	Possibly not, but eventually I was able to kill all timers
	whose usage had ended before I unloaded the module.
	(Failures to do so announced themselves very soon after
	 unloading the module.)
	My primary mission still was to modload the IPv4 only
	when needed, and after that it isn't likely so important
	to unload it...
