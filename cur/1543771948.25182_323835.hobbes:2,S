Hey! Thanks for the feedback! I'm trying to encourage architectures to
share timesource drivers, so for now I'm not so worried if we end up
with something that looks like drivers/net/. 
So unless you strenuously object, I say lets put it off until the need
becomes a bit more apparent. Although its likely I'll agree with you
once I've started working on converting ARM. :)
thanks
