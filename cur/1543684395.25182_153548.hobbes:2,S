I believe there was a post this past weekend about block sizes (or maybe
fragment sizes) on the Opteron.  It wasn't with XFS I'm pretty sure.  I
tried searching for it, but can't find it again.
I'm going to start playing with an Opteron pretty soon.  I will be using
XFS.  What are the recommended settings when creating file systems?
