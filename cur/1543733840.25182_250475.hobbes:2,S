Obvisously cramfs can not support XIP, because the "in-place" image
is compressed (unless you have a processor that can execute compressed
code :)
AFAIK only tmpfs supports XIP because it works on a higher level
without using block devices underneath. Ramdisks are simply RAM
block devices that behave like any other block device.
You can have a compressed image in flash (for instance), decompress
everything into a tmpfs and execute from there.
I'm not sure, however, that this will be such a performance gain.
If you use cramfs (for instance) then the kernel will uncompress
and run only the pages that are needed, and they will be cached in
page cache so that they will be available again when needed. This
way you only waste the RAM you actually need, and can still drop
old pages if the application needs more RAM.
Just my two cents,
