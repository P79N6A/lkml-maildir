Hello.
I have a RH7.3-based system with recompiled original 2.4.20 kernel runing on 
dual 2.4GHz Xeon machine.
I'd like to know if there is a dedicated Xeon support in 2.4.21-pre? kernels.
The thing is I'm trying to compile RTLinux for this machine, but it fails to 
start. The main reason of this is wrong CPU type support in kernel.
I compiled 2.4.20 for Pentium 4, but new Xeons are a bit different. So is 
there a dedicated Xeon support in 2.4.21-pre? kernels?
Thanks.
Artemio.
