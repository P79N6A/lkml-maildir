Something funny is going on here.
Generally, one should increment the refcount of a page when it is put into
some container.  That means that the page should get +1 when it is added to
a bio.  (direct-io does this, but the mpage.c pagecache code cheats, and
relies upon PG_locked and PG-writeback protecting the page).
Similarly, the network code (or its caller) should be incrementing the
page's refcount as the page goes into a container (ie: the skb) and
decrementing it as the page is removed.
But someone somewhere is breaking those rules.  Who?

Odd.  You _should_ be able to use plain old get_page() and put_page().  If
you use a raw decrement of page->count then there's a risk that this was
the final reference and the page will leak forever.  We do need to use
put_page()'s return-it-to-the-allocator-if-this-was-the-last-use logic.
So.  Who is breaking refcounting protocol here?  Perhaps it is AOE, failing
to increment the refcount on pages as they are added to an skb?
(Do we know which callsite in XFS is adding zero-ref pages to a BIO, btw?)
