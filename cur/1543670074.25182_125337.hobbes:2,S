I think it has to do with the interaction between XFree86 4.3.0 and
the AGP code.
I have wdm as my display manager. I am able to login, but when logging
out the system dies. These are the last two messages printed on the
serial console:
   agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 00:00.0 into 4x mode
   agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 01:00.0 into 4x mode
and then, hard freeze.
These lines do not appear when using XFree86 4.2.1 .
I have a Radeon 8500 and AGP 4x is enabled in BIOS. The motherboard is
ECS K7S5A (SIS 735 chipset).
Dave, if you have any patch to test send it over!
