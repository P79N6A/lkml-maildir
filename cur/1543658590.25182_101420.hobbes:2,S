Hi,
George already gave you some good info.
Here's a little more that might help.

The debugger has already listed all of the kernel symbols that
it can associate with addresses on the stack, here:

Actually it has 6 local variables, and they might not be allocated
any space on the stack at all.  They could all be in registers,
or a few of them in registers and others on the stack.
The arguments are pushed onto the stack (for x86), as George indicated.
