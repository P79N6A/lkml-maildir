Sorry for the slow response; am on holidays.
I'm confused.  This is the first time I've looked at the input code,
so please bear with me.
So, you hotplug in a device that has a suspend key, and you want the
power.ko module to match it?  Hmm, cool.
How about a mneumonic for each type?  Like so for
drivers/input/power.c:
	/* B: bus, V: Vendor, P: Product, R: Version.
	 * E: evbit, K: keybit, A: absbit, M: mscbit, L: ledbit,
	 * S: sndbit, F: ffbit. */
	/*
	input:B*V*P*R*E*key*K*suspend*A*M*L*S*F*
	input:B*V*P*R*E*key*K*power*A*M*L*S*F*
	input:B*V*P*R*E*K*power*A*M*L*S*F*
You could use "p" instead of power, but the full names are probably
better since they are clear and most drivers only seem to have a
handful from my casual grepping.

Not in practice, at least so I was assured by Greg.  Do you know of a
counter example?
I really prefer generating aliases to hold this meta-information where
possible, because it's so simple for anyone to use them.

Well, noone uses it directly: it's an internal detail of modprobe.
But it's designed for the hotplug stuff.  I'll eventually get around
to converting them if Greg doesn't first, because sooner or later
those map files are going to break.
Hope that clarifies!
Rusty.
