No I haven't. The >8TB right now is attached to a 64 bit machine, but we
should able to move it to a 32 bit machine.

I made a kernel patch to allow a file to specify which block group it
wants it's blocks to allocate from(using ioctl to set the goal
allocation block group). I set the goal block group falls to somewhere
>8TB, and did dd tests on that file. Verified this with debugfs, the
allocated block numbers are beyond 2**31.
Also before run fsx tests, created many directories (32768 at most:) and
verified one directory's inode is located in block group >8TB space. So
when we do fsx test on files under that directory, we are
creating/testing files >8TB.
BTW, do you think this ioctl is useful in general for other users? I
attached the patch here.
I also plan to hack the code of inode allocation to force all files's
inode is put in the block group >8TB, so that we could do a full
filesystem tests there.

Sure, I will verify that on my 32 bit machine with >8TB.
