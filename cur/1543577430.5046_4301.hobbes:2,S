Nicholas,
While I can see what you are asking, here are some comments in Alan's
favor:
He did not say people can not release 2.2 patches without 2.4 patches.
He only said they will not be integrated into the kernel distribution
without 2.4 patches.
If people continue to develop for 2.2 and have someone else, who is
probably less familiar with the hardware, port to 2.4 for them, how soon
would you trust the drivers over the 2.2 drivers?
In short, I agree with Alan completely. This is the correct move forward
to cause 2.4 to become the stable release that everyone will be willing
to adopt.
