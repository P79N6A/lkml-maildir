Hi Jeff,
   I removed this code from release sent to Linus because of it was written
for Simmon's I2C (lm_sensors) because of it looks better layered to me
(and provides more services, for example send x bytes & receive y can be
easily written; only problem I've found is that bit-banging adapter is not
able to find its I2C minor number easily, so you cannot easily and unique
tell, which I2C# belongs to which fb#).
   Also, DDC[123] protocol is not available for free from VESA and I do not
want to spend money for this unless I know I could release product under
GPL. So current status is that after G400-multihead or G200 with rainbow
runner came to me (they both uses another I2C bus internally), I'll write
something again (or borrow from g200-grabber project), which will work both
I2C buses present on matroxes. But it is really low priority, currently
I want to get G400 to work with 32MB instead of 16MB of memory.
   And because of feature freeze is going to happen soon, I have question
(I did not ask on simmons i2c forum yet) - should I base it on Simmons
I2C or on current kernel I2C implementation (kernel I2C does not
provide start-send_x_bytes-start-recv_y_bytes-stop currently :-( And
some monitors do not work with another sequence (x=2, y=128)?
                                    Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
                                                vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
