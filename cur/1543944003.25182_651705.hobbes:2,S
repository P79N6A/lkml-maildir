Hello,
I have an XFS filesystem containing files and symlinks with application-specific EAs in the user namespace. The files, symlinks and their EAs were created while running a 2.4 kernel. 
In 2.6 kernels access to user EAs was prevented for symlinks. My problem is that i have to upgrade the kernel from 2.4 to 2.6 series and i have to have access to all the EAs after upgrade. Is there a way to read user EAs off of symlinks on an XFS filesystem on a 2.6 kernel either from userspace or from a filter driver sitting between VFS and XFS filesystem code?
I would appreciate it very much if somebody could point me towards a solution.
