Okay, so some further digging revealed that someone was testing out the
"ethertap" device, which according to him requires ip_forwarding and proxy_arp
to be turned on.  I suspect this is what changed and caused the problems.  Since
rebooting cleaned up the /proc filesystem and reset these to zero, the problems
went away.
This feels like the answer to me.  It saw the arp requests coming in the one
interface, sent them out the other interface, and the other machines got
confused because they saw that arps coming from a different MAC address.
Guess this goes to show the problems people can get into with stuff they don't
understand....
