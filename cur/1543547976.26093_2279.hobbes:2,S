You can ran into problems using schedule_timeout() in a block device request 
function under 2.4. 
This can be demonstrated by starting some I/O intensive tasks to your block
device and running sync in another task. Eventually the block layer will
lock up.
This can be fixed by creating a kernel thread per flash device to handle
the I/O requests.  Within the thread schedule_timeout() works fine. This
solution also works under 2.2 and 2.0.38
