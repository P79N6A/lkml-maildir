        Just a "me too" here.. I've had this problem since around 2.5.15-dj 
and later, and have had input and keyboard support compiled into the kernel. 
Luckily I was able to get into the box via ssh, and check things. both 
keyboard and mouse are PS/2. If possible, see if you can do this, and check if 
IRQ 1 is not listed in /proc/interrupts. That is what is happening with me, 
while my mouse is working. For me to get my keyboard to work, I have to have 
the following set:
CONFIG_INPUT=y
CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X=1024
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y=768
CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_EVBUG=y
CONFIG_SERIO=y
CONFIG_SERIO_SERPORT=m
CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_XTKBD=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE=y
CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=y
        This leaves me without using the new Input API, but with a working 
keyboard. with using the new API, mouse will work, keyboard will not. you can 
try these, and use the old setup (I assume will be made legacy by the time 2.6 
comes out), and let me know if they work. The new API seems to be working for 
some people, but not all.
                                                        BL.
