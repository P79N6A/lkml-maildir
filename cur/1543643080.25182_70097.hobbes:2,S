It's a little different for modules.  For one thing, modules are
sometimes used like switches: to make the system behave differently,
plug in some module, to make it stop doing that, remove the module
again.  The user wants those transitions to happen *now*, like a
switch.  Sure, we can make various guru arguments about why the user
is wrong, but in the end, the user is never wrong, in the customer
sense.
Anyway, this problem is under control now and the nice solution also
happens to be the simplest, so what more could you ask for.

Oh absolutely.  Please see my recent [RFC] Raceless module interface.

I wish I could agree with you about that, but Al is a special case.
I think he actually *likes* it, like a Pit Bull likes fighting.  He
certainly became easier to deal with after I fell into the habit of
returning each insult promptly and unambiguously.  Note: Al is the one
person on the list that I deal with this way, and he worked really
hard to get there.

And what do you propose to do about the modules it doesn't work for?
Sorry, rhetorical question, the solution is laid out in the above
[RFC].

Yes, well please read the [RFC] and pass judgement on whether it's
optimal or not.
