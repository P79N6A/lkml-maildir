Make no mistake, I do not intend to see preempt-kernel in 2.4.  I will,
however, continue to maintain the patch for endusers and such that use
it.  A proper in-kernel solution for 2.4 in my opinion in mini-ll,
perhaps extend with any other obviously-completely-utterly sane bits
from full-ll.
For 2.5, however, I tout preempt as the answer.  This does not mean just
preempt.  It means a preemptible kernel as a basis for beginning
low-latency works in manners other than explicit scheduling statements.
