you can find the latest 2.4 based O(1) scheduler patch at:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-2.4.19-rc2-A4
this patch includes the load_balance() fixes as well. (generally you
should check this directory regularly, sometimes i put out patches without
announcing them - like this one.)
