3W for the complete system? In CPU state S1? [1]
And even 3W would still be a waste of energy.
And what would be the advantage? The socket my computer is connected at 
is located below my bed so I can turn the power on while still lying in 
bed (the computer is not reachable from my bed). OK, I could create an 
external power button for the computer using longer cables connected to 
the motherboard, but I still haven't understood why this should be 
better for my use case than suspend-to-disk.
