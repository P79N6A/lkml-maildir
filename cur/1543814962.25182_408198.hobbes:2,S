Subject: [PATCH] udf: fix uid/gid options and add uid/gid=ignore and forget options
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/19/128

This patch corrects the incorrect patch previously applied in
commit 4d6660eb3665f22d16aff466eb9d45df6102b254.  I had posted
the correction as a reply on lkml, but it seems that the earlier
and incorrect patch got merged into Linus's tree.  This patch
also adds documentation for the changes made last time.

+The uid= and gid= options need a bit more explaining.  They will accept a
+decimal numeric value which will be used as the default ID for that mount.
+They will also accept the string "ignore" and "forget".  For files on the disk
+that are owned by nobody ( -1 ), they will instead look as if they are owned
+by the default ID.  The ignore option causes the default ID to override all
+IDs on the disk, not just -1.  The forget option causes all IDs to be written
+to disk as -1, so when the media is later remounted, they will appear to be
+owned by whatever default ID it is mounted with at that time.  
+
+For typical desktop use of removable media, you should set the ID to that
+of the interactively logged on user, and also specify both the forget and
+ignore options.  This way the interactive user will always see the files
+on the disk as belonging to him.

The remaining are for debugging and disaster recovery:
