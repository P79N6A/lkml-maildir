As I have not seen anyone else respond to this I will give it a stab.
short answer
Solaris has a two step scheduler where scheduling a process takes 10-100
times as long as to schedule a thread
Linux process scheduling is on the same order of magnatude as the solaris
thread scheduler (I don't remember which is faster, but they are very
close).
As a result of this Linus and others decided not to add a second level
scheduler to linux on the basis that most scheduling will be between
processes anyway and to add a second layer would slow down the "normal"
case.
Instead what is available is a variation of fork called "clone" which
creates another process that shares the memory region of the parent
instead of having it's own memory area. This allows a thread library to
simulate almost every funcion of POSTIX threads (the only parts that are
sot currently simulated are the symantic of all threads having the same
PID, and sending one thread a halt signal haling all threads, the second
at least is being worked on.)
I am an observer to this, not a kernal hacker so please correct me if I am
misunderstanding any of this.
