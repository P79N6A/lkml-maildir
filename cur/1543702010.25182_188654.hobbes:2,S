The way I see this, dev_kfree_skb_any() is not used in any performance critical
path, so at worst during device shutdown, reset, or power-down, TX queue
packet freeing work could be delayed by up to one jiffie.
Therefore I've put the "|| irqs_disabled()" version of the fix into my tree.
Thanks for working this out with me Jeff :)
