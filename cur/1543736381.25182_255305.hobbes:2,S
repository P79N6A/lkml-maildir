My suggestion was flawed in that it could
violate POSIX requirements (as Russell pointed out).
Removing the lock from tty_termios_baud_rate(), tty_io.c
corrects the problem for the path from change_termios()
to tty_termios_baud_rate(), which is causing the deadlock.
This may not be, and probably is not,
correct for all paths to tty_termios_baud_rate().
The following patch (against 2.6.9-rc2-mm3)
fixes the deadlock for testing purposes,
but is not a complete solution.
As Alan works through this feedback,
the final fix will emerge.
