It's the preference of the maintainer.  It's a tossup:  using the type
in the kmalloc makes the type being allocated obvious.  But using
sizeof(*var) is a tiny bit more resistant to change.
Neither one sufficiently affects long term maintenance AFAICS, so it's
personal preference, not any sort of kernel standard one way or the
other...
