I'd suggest with trying the latest BK cset patch (which fixes -pre5 and
also fixes some things in general).

This happened in the kjournald thread context. I'm not sure it is
ieee1394 related, but it is suspect that it happened in the middle of
handling an ieee1394 bus reset.
Is this reproducible when loading the ohci1394 driver? If so, does it
occur when you turn off hotplug (IOW, don't load sbp2 driver) or if the
sbp2 device is not attached?
