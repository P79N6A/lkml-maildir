I finally managed to test this and it seems to work. I now get the
following numa_node attributes:
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/numa_node    0

The 5 last lines above would report 0 instead of 1 with an older kernel.
Everything looks correct now (0000:40 is the second PCIe bus and it is
attached to socket #1).
Thanks a lot, Yinghai! Are you planning to merge these patches in the
near future? 2.6.26?

PS: I saved the corresponding dmesg. If you want to look at it, please
let me know.
