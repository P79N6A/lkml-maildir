Cool, thanks for the research, I have a concern about this however.
its an interesting patch, but it raises the question why does
e100_init_hw need to be called at all in resume?  I looked back
through our history and that init_hw call has always been there.  I
think its incorrect, but its taking me a while to set up a system with
the ability to resume.
everywhere else in the driver alloc_cbs is called before init_hw so it
just seems like a long standing bug.
comments?  anyone want to test? i compile tested this, but it is untested.
