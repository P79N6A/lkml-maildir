As far as I can tell,
only place need_resched is set is in the scheduler and the sched idle loop.
This  is what makes Ingo's latency patch less dangerous: need_resched is hard
to set.  Your scenario requires that an interrupt routine, interrupting
kernel mode, set needs_resched. Where does this happen?
