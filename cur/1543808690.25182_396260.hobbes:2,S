Subject: [PATCH 2/3] compound page: default destructor
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Somehow I imagined that calling a NULL destructor would free a compound
page rather than oopsing.  No, we must supply a default destructor,
__free_pages_ok using the order noted by prep_compound_page.  hugetlb
can still replace this as before with its own free_huge_page pointer.
The case that needs this is not common: rarely does put_compound_page's
put_page_testzero bring the count down to 0.  But if get_user_pages is
applied to some part of a compound page, without immediate release (e.g.
AIO or Infiniband), then it's possible for its put_page to come after
the containing vma has been unmapped and the driver done its free_pages.
That's just the kind of case compound pages are supposed to be guarding
against (but Nick points out, nor did PageReserved handle this right).
