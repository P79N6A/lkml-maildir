I have another question about i2c...
The 'sensors' program gives me a stange message:
w83627thf-i2c-9191-290
Can't get adapter name for bus 9191    <<<<<-----------------------------
VCore:     +1.49 V  (min =  +1.94 V, max =  +1.94 V)       ALARM  
+12.0V:   +11.86 V  (min = +10.82 V, max = +13.19 V)              
+ 3.3V:    +3.30 V  (min =  +3.14 V, max =  +3.47 V)              
...
And gnome-sensors-applet can't read the sensors. If using libsensors, no
value is displayed (I suppose an applicacion bug). And the access to sensors
directly through i2c-dev gives an error like this:
Error opening sensor device file:
/sys/devices/platform/i2c-9191/9191-0290/....
In fact, the real path is 
/sys/devices/platform/i2c-adapter:i2c-9191/9191-0290/....
I supposed it was a kernel change not tracked by userspace, but the strange
thing is that looking at the code the sensors applet lists the sensors
reding directories and files in /sys (AFAICS in the code).
So perhaps there is a little inconsistency, /sys says in some place the
sensor is at xxxxx, when it really is at yyyyy.
Or the 'i2c-adapter:' is a bug and should be 'i2c-adapter/'.
