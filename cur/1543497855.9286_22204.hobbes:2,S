Subject: 2.2.X: Kernel problem with Linux NFS mount from SGI with "nohide" option

Hi,
We just noticed problems with NFS mounting directories from SGI servers
that contain directories that are exported with the SGI-specific
"nohide" option. Here is our NFS configuration:
NFS-Server: SGI machine "lumen" with IRIX 6.5.3m:
/etc/exports:
	/ -nohide <list of machines>
	/nobackup -nohide <list of machines>
NFS-clients: Linux machine:
RedHat6.0, kernel 2.2.5, (with knfsd-1.2.2-4 in case it should be
relevant) or
Debian2.1, kernel 2.2.7, with (nfs-server 2.2beta37-1)
And here is what happens:
-------------------------------------
# mount lumen:/ /mnt
# ls -F /mnt
/mnt:
6.2/          dev.index     hw/           lib64         nobackup/    
sbin/        
Desktop       dev/          irix65        licensed      ns/          
usr/          
aw/           dumpster/     irix@         local         opt/         
var/          
bin@          etc/          lib/          mnt/          proc/         u/
debug         home/         lib32         sat/          unix*         
root@necropolis / # ls -F /mnt
/mnt: Input/output error.
-------------------------------------
It is as simple as mounting the directory and having ls(1) stat(2) the
files in there (a simple ls(1) without the -l or -F option does not
trigger the bug).
The same test on a system with generic RedHat5.2 does not show the bug,
though. To me this seems to indicate a bug in the 2.2.X kernel.
Everything works just fine with an SGI as a client, as well.
Here are the linux kernel messages related to the bug
-------------------------------------
Jun  4 15:46:45 necropolis kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 128 busy,
i_count=2, i_nlink=34 
Jun  4 15:46:45 necropolis kernel: nfs_free_dentries: found ///,
d_count=26, hashed=0 
Jun  4 15:46:45 necropolis kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 128 still busy,
i_count=2 
Jun  4 15:46:45 necropolis kernel: __nfs_fhget: killing /// filehandle 
Jun  4 15:46:45 necropolis kernel: nfs_readdir: inode is NULL or not a
directory 
-------------------------------------
We were under the impression that the nohide option is transparent to
the client, but apparently the Linux implementation does see a
difference on the client side.
Anyone out there who has seen this before and has an idea of how to fix
this bug?
Thanks,
	Philipp Slusallek

P.S.: If required we could make such a mount point available to test
