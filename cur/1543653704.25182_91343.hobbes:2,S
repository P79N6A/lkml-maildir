That makes more sense to me, because it will be fine to use `ptr' even
on 128-bit pointer machines when they arrive, yet preserves the
property that 64<->32 bit conversion functions don't need to reformat
the buffer when running 32-bit applications on a 64-bit CPU... even if
the 32-bit application uses the `ptr' field.
Did I just write that? :)
