Sorry.  I finally have found the original deprecation commit.

The comment about kernel.version is odd. That information is available in
uname so I can't imagine why sys_sysctl would be an interesting source.
Also kernel.version is the compile string so it is pretty uninteresting
to glibc.
I guess if it is really needed someone will scream before the code gets
deleted completely.
