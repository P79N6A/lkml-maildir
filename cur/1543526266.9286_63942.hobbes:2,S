That's exactly what I was referring to.  A lot of this code is essentially
unchanged from Windows 3.x.
Also, I rather doubt he was running Windows 98 on a 4MB 386sx.  It was
probably an older version of Windows without the new stuff.
I suspect there isn't a *whole* lot of difference in size between the C++
stuff in Windows 9x and its (rough) Linux counterparts.  
Also, I think Windows is better optimized to run in 16-color VGA mode.  A lot
of 386sx systems could handle anything higher (except maybe 320x200 8-bit
mode).
