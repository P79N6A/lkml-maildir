The patches that fixed it for me were:
http://kernel.org/hg/index.cgi/linux-2.6/rev/85295
http://kernel.org/hg/index.cgi/linux-2.6/rev/85296
Which, as you can see, were already committed to the kernel repository during 
the 2.6.25 merge window.
They don't seem to be in the 2.6.24.2 tarball, though.
I dunno if that's the same problem you're seeing or not...
