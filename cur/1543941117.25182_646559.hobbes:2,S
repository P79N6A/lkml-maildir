Hmm. This has a number of commits that have a questionable sign-off 
history (I complained about the same thing for the networking code). 
Namely you cannot follow the path from "author" -> "committer" through the 
sign-offs. 
The reason seems to be that you are using some automatic service for your 
hg/git gateway, and your committer information gets corrupted by that.
Please don't do this. I realize that Sign-offs don't always exist for the 
whole path - we do take one-liners or otherwise known-ok patches from 
sources without the sign-off of the author (ie not the normal (a) case for 
the initial sign-off) - but the *normal* case should be that the whole 
path from author->committer should be covered. 
There is absolutely zero value in an automated "committer" field. Please 
fix your hg gateway to not do this kind of crap.
