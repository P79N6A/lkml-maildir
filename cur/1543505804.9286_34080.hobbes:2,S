Hi,
Just a simple question about sock-locking and wait-queues.
As far as I can see, most of the TCP/IP code makes sure
that the "struct sock" is locked (lock_sock(sk)) before adding or removing
tasks from the sk->sleep waitqueue. But wait_for_tcp_memory
(/net/ipv4/tcp.c line 707) explicitly doesn't.
Is it required to "lock the sock" before modifing the sk->sleep waitqueue,
or is it safe not to have the sock locked?
(All kernel 2.3.13)
Greetings,
