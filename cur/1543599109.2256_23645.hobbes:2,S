Is there a reason aging alone cannot do most of the work instead. When you
readahead a page you look to age a page that is a a bit over the readahead
window further back in the file if it is in memory, and has no mapped users
- ie its just cache.
That seems to cost us extra lookups in the page cache hashes but push things
in the right direction.
