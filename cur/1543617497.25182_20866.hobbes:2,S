So text/plain is ok for you? How about multiple cummulative patches
attached to one mail?
This is the case where I hate your strategy about attachments: You
want to have separate patches (what I clearly understand), but you do
not want attachments. That's fine most of the time as long as I send
it to you privately, but to public lists too many people miss the
important steps.
