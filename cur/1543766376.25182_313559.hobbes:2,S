Umm, the whole point of using a digest for the name is to catch these  
things as they happen. So if you'd use the whole original bit sequence as  
a name, you'd need to have exactly the same bit errors in the data, in the  
name, and in the reference to the object, to miss nopticing the problem  
early. And it *still* isn't a collision - the data behind name X is  
exactly X, always, or it's easily recognizable as broken.
Whereas a hash collision means that both X and Y should be behind name Z.  
Both are *correct* behind name Z.
Entirely different situations.

Actually, there is, and your non-hashed name system achieves it.

If that was a truely random thing, then you might have been right. But it  
isn't. All possible blobs to a given digest are NOT equally probably (or  
of a probability only depending on their size).
We really, really don't know how likely a collision is for the data we  
want to store there - just for truely random data.
