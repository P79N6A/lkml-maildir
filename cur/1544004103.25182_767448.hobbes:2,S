a high-pass filter should be applied in any case, to filter out the 
"nothing happened" baseline. Eliminating every delta below 500-1000 
cycles would do the trick i think, all IRQ costs are at least 1000 
cycles.
then a low-pass filter should be applied to eliminate non-irq noise 
such as scheduling effects or expensive irqs (which are both 
uninteresting to such analysis).
and then _that_ double-filtered dataset should be normalized: the 
number of events should be made the same. (just clip the larger 
dataset to the length of the smaller dataset)

i was only looking at before/after duos, for the same basic type of 
workload. Idle versus hackbench is indeed apples to oranges.
