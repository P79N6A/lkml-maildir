Brian,
Crashme was written by George Carrette.  Info and source can be had at :
http://people.delphi.com/gjc/crashme.html
In essence, it creates a random data stream and tells the system to try
and execute it.  Like the mythical infinite number of monkeys, it will
occasionally generate stuff that will trigger system failures.
