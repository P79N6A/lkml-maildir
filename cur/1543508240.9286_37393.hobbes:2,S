Obviously, c) is the best, however it's difficult to do with signals.
Allocating a signal specifically for this is kind of a waste. Are you
thinking perhaps registering which singal should be raised by an ioctl?
I was hoping to get something similar to c) with a poll interface. That
way it can block in poll or poll the fd along with other fd's the
program may need.
