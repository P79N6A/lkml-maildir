One thing that tape gives you that most backup-to-disk don't is *OFFSITE*
backup.  Unless you're backing up over a fiberchannel or other network to
another machine in a *REMOTE* building, some things can take out the whole
enchilada.

(For what it's worth, our offsite vault is about 2 miles from our machine room)
