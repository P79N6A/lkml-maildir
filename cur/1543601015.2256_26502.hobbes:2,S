   Find out why Linux PS/2 keyboard and mouse drivers don't support
   disconnect, and reconnect of said devices.   Then fix things so
   that keyboard can be replugged at any time, and it gets into
   sensible state, same with the mouse.
   This is especially serious nuisance while running X-window system,
   which of course uses raw keyboard events.  (But that should not matter
   at the low-level driver, which should handle the reconnect issue.)
