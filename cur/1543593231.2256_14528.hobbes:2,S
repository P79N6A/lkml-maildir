IT IS NEVER EVER SAFE TO ALLOCATE 1kB OF STACK!
Why?
 - automatic checkers are wonderful, and we do not want to have "oh, in
   this case it is magically ok" kinds of things.
 - the kernel stack is 4kB, and _nobody_ has the right to eat up a
   noticeable portion of it. It doesn't matter if you "know" your caller
   or not: you do not know what interrupts happen during this time, and
   how much stack they want.
Ergo: the simple rule of "don't allocate big structures of the stack" is
always a good rule, and making excuses for it is bad.
