Forgive me if any of this is old news -
I loaded up 2.5.52bk6 on a couple of systems here and took it
for a spin - both systems had previously run 2.4.18-RH, 2.4.19-aa,
and 2.4.19/20-ckX
I found it rather impressive - subjectively speaking, the 2.5 kernel
had a snappier feel on the desktop. Mozilla page scrolling remained
smooth while loading a page with many images on 2.5, while scrolling
stuttered and hesitated while loading the same page on 2.4.20-ck2.
2.5 also remained usable while running dbench or ltp -
On the down side, modules that loaded automatically under 2.4 now
have to be manually loaded - for instance my iptables script has
to now first manually load each and every needed module before it
issues any iptables commands or it dies - 2.4 automagically loaded
the required modules.
And now we come to the little show stopper - one of my systems has
an intel motherboard with built-in i810 video. I can manually load
the agp module, but it yields a cosmetic oops:
[drm:drm_init] *ERROR* Cannot initialize the agpgart module.
Uninitialised timer!
This is just a warning.  Your computer is OK
function=0x00000000, data=0x0

More seriously, any attempt to load the i810 drm module fails:
# modprobe i810
FATAL: Error inserting i810 
(/lib/modules/2.5.52bk6/kernel/drivers/char/drm/i810.ko): Cannot 
allocate memory
Any hope for i810 drm soon?  Other than that it's looking sweet here.
Kudos for an awesome kernel in the making!
Best Regards,
Joe
