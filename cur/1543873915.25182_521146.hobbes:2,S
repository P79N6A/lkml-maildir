I am still working to fairly compare the various combinations.  One of
the problems is that if you push any reclaim algorithm to its physical
limits you will get the same overall success rates.
I think there is still some work to do refining lumpy, and reclaim in
general.  But I feel what we have now is pretty solid base for that.

I think this is a key component of the mix and am just starting to play
with this.  I hope that this can provide improvements in the
instantaneous availability of these higher orders and improve average
latency.
