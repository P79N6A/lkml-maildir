After donning my brown paper bag yesterday I looked at 
the call-paths again and removed one more lock pair
(the one in swapfile). The others seemed OK so I made 
a SMP-on-UP kernel and ran my usual stuff (X, mozilla, 
kernel compiles) alongside mmap001, mmap002 and misc001
with no ill effects.
I will beat on it some more today and tomorrow, but if
real SMP is needed for testing I need some help to do
that.
