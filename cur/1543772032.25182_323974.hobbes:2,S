Guys, here's a (yes I know, fairly vague) error report - I'm just
beginning to narrow this down.  Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated.
Dual opteron (Sun Fire v20z), 2G RAM, untainted x86_64 kernels (no
preempt or other fancy stuff, just plain and simple K8 NUMA ACPI
configs);
Problem with 2.6.11.11:  Machine hangs during backup (amanda) - right
after the estimates are done the box will freeze hard, nothing on
console.
Tried 2.6.12-rc6 in the hope that it would at least print out a panic or
oops for me:  Haven't tried the backup yet, but I got the following in
the logs which I've never seen before:
gcc[18818]: segfault at 00000000332c8e54 rip 000000005555a0a8 rsp 00000000ffffba4c error 6

So, with 2.6.12-rc6 all of the sudden klogd and gcc starts
segfaulting...
No ECC errors or other anormalities reported via the service processor.
Anything you want me to try?  Need more information?
