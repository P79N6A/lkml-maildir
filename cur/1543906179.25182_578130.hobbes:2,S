That reminds me of something else odd that I noticed.
While I had CONFIG_THINKPAD_ACPI_INPUT_ENABLED=y and was trying
to get Fn+F4 to give me Suspend to RAM somehow, I did try setting
/sys/blah/blah/blah/hotkey_enable to 0.
That caused the Fn+F4 key to become active, except that it wanted
to do Hibernation to Disk instead: a window popped up to tell me
(IIRC) that my kernel command line didn't have a good resume=
