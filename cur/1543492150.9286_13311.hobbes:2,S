	The subject sounds radical ?  So it is intended..
	Read with a thought.  (Perhaps this should be
	put into FAQs of the list too ?)

	Yeah, that is a (misguided) case of "ban that domain because
	its used in so many spams.."
	I have contemplated doing exactly that for AOL at VGER,
	but VGER does have a few lists where AOL users are in
	great abundance...    Can't do it  :-/
	Oh yes, often when list-owners get that type of rejections,
	our reaction is simple:  Remove the recipient which yields
				 the rejection report.
	(in fact, remove any recipient which yields any rejection,
	 including any recipient which yields delivery timeout...)
	Sure that reaction may sound stupid to you at first, but consider
	that each of us must somehow process something like 200 to 2000
	rejection reports every day thru all the year, and we do all that
	at our spare time.
	Unfortunately we postmasters/list-owners don't have the luxury
	of time to educate people of the nyances of email systems; when
	to blame some system, and when *not* to blame.  That last one
	can be a difficult question to answer without 5+ years of email
	systems and protocols experience...
	So, if you folks want to filter incoming email against some source
	addresses carrying SPAM, be damn carefull that you don't filter
	too much.   Letting *some* spam thru is way better than killing
	all your incoming email.
	Filtering the email by delivering it to /dev/null is also better
	approach, than rejecting it at the input phase.  Sure the byte-
	counters spin, but that isn't so bad as becoming removed because
	of over-eager pre-reception blocking based on false rules.
