[It says it is too big for 'long', actually].
That's because this is not valid ISO C90.  GCC tries to help you out
by using the C99 rules (it has to do something, and terminating with
an error would be a bit rude).  Perhaps the kernel should use C99
mode (-std=gnu99, to get the GNU C extensions).

These are unnecessary, Linux requires an int to be at least 32 bits.

Here you can use LL resp. ULL on all archs.
Do these new macros really buy anything over just writing LL in the
few places that 64-bit constants are used?
