Variant on akpm's last patch with this change, plus one extra
s/page->index/page_index/ that he missed.  I've moved the whole
next=page_index+1 and wrapping check up to just after we've tested the
mapping, so even if we break early all of that updating has already been
done reliably and we don't end up setting next in two places in the
code.
A 400-task fsstress used to livelock reliably within minutes inside
O_DIRECT without any fix; this patch has been running for over an hour
now without problem.

Fix livelock in invalidate_inode_pages2_range
invalidate_inode_pages2_range can loop indefinitely if pagevec_lookup
returns only pages beyond the end of the range being invalidated.  Fix
it by advancing the restart pointer, "next", every time we see a page on
the correct mapping, not just if the page is within the range; and break
out early when we encounter such a page.  Based on a proposed fix by
akpm.
