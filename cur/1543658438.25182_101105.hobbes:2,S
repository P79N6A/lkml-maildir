Justin, are you quite sure that these tests actually work?
I too have just run into
aic7xxx: PCI Device 0:16:0 failed memory mapped test.  Using PIO.
aic7xxx: PCI Device 0:17:0 failed memory mapped test.  Using PIO.
with aic79xx-linux-2.4-20021230 (6.2.25) in Linux 2.4.21-pre3.
What makes me scratch my head in particular is:
	o  The chipset is i440BX aka the Compatibility King.
	o  I've never had *any* problems with 6.2.8.
Full ahc boot-up messages follow:
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:10.0
aic7xxx: PCI Device 0:16:0 failed memory mapped test.  Using PIO.
PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:11.0
aic7xxx: PCI Device 0:17:0 failed memory mapped test.  Using PIO.
