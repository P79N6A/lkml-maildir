Hello,
You asked (paraphrased)
> Why is fs-private info is kept in the union of VFS inode instead of

I don't know the answer to your question, however, exactly identical
situation is with the super_block, i.e. fs-private super_block info is
kept in the union of struct super_block instead of just a generic void
*ptr that could be initialized when the filesystem is mounted by
read_super.
Whoever answers your question - can you please also unaswer mine?
Thank you,
