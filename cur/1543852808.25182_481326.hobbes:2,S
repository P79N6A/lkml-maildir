We had a discussion a while back about drivers/uio and the fact the stuff
was buggy, contained security holes and not really fit/ready for -mm.
Since that point nobody has fixed it (in part because they are doing
vastly cooler stuff elsewhere in the kernel) so I think its time
drivers/uio in -mm talk a walk to the bitbucket until someone makes it
secure and resurrects it if needed.
So given the elapsed time
NACK: drivers/uio
