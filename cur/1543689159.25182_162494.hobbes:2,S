The page cache page is mapped into the application just like a shared
mapping, until the application writes to the mapped region and
triggers the copy-on-write fault.
This means that if you write() to the page prior to the copy-on-write
fault, you may see the changes in application memory straight away.
If some other process writes to the page through a writable mapping,
you may see the changes.
On the other hand you may not.  On some of the architectures which
Linux supports, the CPU's cache is not sufficiently coherent to
guarantee that what is written with write(), or by another process,
will be seen in this application's memory.  Indeed, you might see a
mixture of some of the written data and some of the data before it was
written, with no particular guarantee of which bits of data or in what
order.
