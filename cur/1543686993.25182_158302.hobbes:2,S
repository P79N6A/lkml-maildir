They have not. I just tried.
I have two boxes with 2 interfaces each and a third for testing. Testbox 1 has
2.2 kernel, testbox 2 has 2.4 kernel.
The three are connected via same switch on primary if.
I ping the second if ip of testbox 2, then arp -vn and see the second ip with
a mac entry of testbox 2 primary if.
I ping the second if ip of testbox 1, then arp -vn and see _no_ entry for this
second ip, it is in fact routed (which I would state as the expected
behaviour as the second ip is from another subnet).

Try it. Proven wrong. See above.
