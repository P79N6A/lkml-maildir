a) just make your management app periodically issue 
  ioctl(fd, GET_CONFIG_INFO, ...)
and make the driver return -1 when the info is not present
b) make a new device and open it with management app
c) make a new node in /proc and open it with management app 
  (cons: requires /proc to be mounted)
d) kernel-user netlink socket (never tried myself)
