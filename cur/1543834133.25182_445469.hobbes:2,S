It LOOKS the same to me...  I have tried to reproduce this OOPS
unsuccessfully, but it seems to be happening for many other users.
I can't imagine why I am unable to reproduce it.
Hopefully Andrew will pull from Mauro's v4l-dvb.git for the new
changesets before he releases the next -mm...
The sanity checking cleanups have already been pushed up there:

You might notice a tragic flaw in the previous code...
bttv_register_video was checking the return value on a void ...  Maybe
we'll get some better debug output after this patch gets out.
Cheers,
