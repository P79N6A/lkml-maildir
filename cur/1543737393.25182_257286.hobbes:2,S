Well it appears that Jesse and Kevin are right and irrespective of the 
setting of /sys/power/disk, i can get the machine to suspend by first 
writing 'platform' into the 'disk' file. And it resumes fine ok. Seems 
to be a false alarm on my part Pavel, although the doc's need updating 
and /sys/power/disk made to show the correct supported suspension methods ?
Thanks for the tips guys (i didn't need the c code Jesse)

My machine shows the same thing. Only shutdown in /sys/power/disk
Grab the code from Documentation/power/swsusp.txt (starts at line 151)
I compiled it to an executable called swsusp and I then run 'swsusp' to
start the suspend process.
2.6.9-rc3 was my first attempt at suspend, and it worked as designed on
the first try.
