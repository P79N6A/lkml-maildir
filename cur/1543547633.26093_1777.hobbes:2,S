	tcpdump binds to another address.

	Hm, it depends. I don't think socket()+connect() will
autobind to a.b.c.1 without bind(). May be there are difficulties
for some of the programs to obtain the preferred source address.

	I have such problems (even wrong devices are selected) with
tcpdump 3.4 but I have never tested any new versions. May be we have
to complain about this default behaviour in tcpdump, i.e. without -i
or -s?

	Isn't that very restrictive? Hm, at first look it seems
it is good arp_solicit to use only inet_select_addr. It seems the
speed is not a problem. Really, is there any setup that requires
each local saddr from the packet to be announced? Someone with
good examples that can't work with inet_select_addr?
