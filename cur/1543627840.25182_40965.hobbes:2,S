I think I'd be less cynical about benchmark results that didn't come from the

Thanks for the pointer.

It sounds like a good idea in theory, but the fact that they share the TLB
cache and other things makes me rather dubious about whether it's really
worth it. I'm not saying it's necessarily bad, I'm just not convinced it's good
yet. Introducing more processors to the OS has it's own problems to deal 
with (ones we're interested in solving anyway).
Real world benchmarks from people other than Intel should make interesting
reading .... I think we need some more smarts in the OS to take real advantage
of this (eg using the NUMA scheduling mods to create cpu pools of 2 "procs"
for each pair, etc) ... will be fun ;-)
