Subject: [RFC] [PATCH -mm] reiser4: replace uid==0 check with capability
Reiser4 gives root some reserved blocks.  Replace the uid==0 check, which
is not safe in the face of user namespaces, with a CAP_SYS_RESOURCE check,
which seems appropriate.
The per-uid and per-guid reservations appear unimplemented so I'm ignoring
them.
