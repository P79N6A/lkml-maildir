Not all in one place.  Read:
Documentation/pci.txt
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
Documentation/IO-mapping.txt
and the attached document, regarding netdevice member locking rules.
Your best reference is other PCI ethernet drivers.  grep for
'pci_module_init' in drivers/net/*.c of the most recent 2.4.x kernel,
for a good start.
Also... before you start thinking about gunking-up your driver with all
sorts of backwards-compatibility code...  remember that most 2.4.x
drivers can easily be backported to 2.2.x with a few magic macros and
static inline functions.  I have an example of this sort of thing at
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/kcompat24/
