Unfortunately, not possible on SGI IA64 systems. The cpus on different
nodes (blades) are not required to be the same steppings or core
frequencies. Core frequencies within the SSI can differ by hundreds of
MHz (~25%).
(I don't recall if we support systems with mixed madison & montecito
processors. If so, IIRC, the itc frequencies of these differ by 4X
for the same core frequency).
