Subject: Remove patch from 2.6.17-rc5-mm3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew:
The patch fix-kbuild-dependencies-for-synclink-drivers.patch
has proven to be wildly unpopular, so please drop it.
At some point in the 2.6.18 series I will look at an
alternative fix.
Thanks,
Paul
