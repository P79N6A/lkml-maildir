Ok, problem goes out. Default option depends on nfs-utils release.

From RFC3010 ( NFSv4 ) section 2.4.1 :
   "For example, if paths /a/b/c and /a/d/c refer to the same file, the       
server SHOULD return the same filehandle for both path names traversals".
For NFSv4  problem should not be shown.
