.. and I'm pretty sure it's immaterial.
We don't just do the "ud2" instruction - we also do the file and line 
number information after it. Which means that __builtin_trap() is useless.
So we might as well keep the loop, since both are two-byte instructions 
that tell gcc that it will never continue.
