Wait a minute. You had suggested (upthread) that these objects are allocated
by partition code and contain per-partition data. Freeing them once the device
is closed looks very odd.

... and that means that we can't make devfs-like filesystems just set
->i_bdev (or ->i_cdev) at read_super() (or lookup()) and avoid all mess
with major/minor allocation.  IMO that's unfortunate, especially since
majors allocation is on the permanent freeze.

Once you look at character devices (they have same set of problems)
frequency goes up big way.
