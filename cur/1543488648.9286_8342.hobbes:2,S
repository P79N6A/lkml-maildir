Hi,
I would like to know what is the function of the /proc/net/rt_cache file
( kernel-2.1.131, slackware 3.6) and the flags it contain. What is the
format of these flags ( hex, octal ... )and the difference with the
flags contained in the /proc/net/route file?
What is the link between the integer flag of the /proc/net/route file
and the symbols U,G,H ... of the routing table ?
Thanks for any help !
Simon.
