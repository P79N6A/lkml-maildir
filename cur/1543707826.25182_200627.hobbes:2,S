Doesn't matter. Because you will drop the inode semaphore before you
actually create a new file. So you'll alway shave a window open for a
race.
That's what Ingo's O_CLEAN thing did. An di fyou do Ingo's O_CLEAN, then 
there's no point to notifiers in the first place - Ingo's algorithm works 
regardless of them (it had other problems, but that's another issue and 
just requires a bit of extending on the basic concept).
So why do you care about dnotify? It doesn't help at all once you have 
O_CLEAN (or equivalent).
