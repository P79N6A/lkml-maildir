I'm going to fine tune this report a little bit.  The behavior change is 
more subtle than I at first thought.
In 2.4: file that has been deleted, and is mapped will show as deleted 
in the maps file
In 2.6: file that has been deleted, and is mapped will show as deleted 
in the maps file
In 2.4: file that has been moved, and is mapped will show as deleted in 
the maps file
In 2.6: file that has been moved, and is mapped will show the new name 
in the maps file
While I don't see this as a bug in the kernel it certainly is a 
regression difference.  ...and I'd still like a way of tracking when the 
filename changes.  If anyone has a good suggestion let me know.
As a side note... this is the output of a file that has actually been 
deleted.  It looks different from the 2.4 version (note the "\040" is 
something new):
40018000-40019000 rw-s 00000000 03:04 13355559
