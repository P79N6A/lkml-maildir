Close: the kernel limits the frequency of the printing to avoid
flooding the log files.  Even if you do get the faults frequently, it
won't print more than 5 warning messages every 5 seconds.  The
floating-point software-assist (fpswa) faults are harmless in the
sense that they don't affect correctness of the program, but if you do
get them _very_ frequently (which is quite rare), they could impair
performance.  FPSWA faults occur only for corner-cases of
floating-point arithmetic, such as operations on denormals or
non-finite numbers.  Many programs don't need denormal support at all
and for those, you can link the program with -ffast-math (GCC) or -ftz
(Intel compiler).  This will turn on "flush-to-zero" mode and avoid
any FPSWA-faults due to denormals (in x86-speak, this is equivalent to
the "flush-to-zero" mode that SSE offers).
If the messages appear with a frequency of less than 5 messages/5
seconds, then there is certainly no performance issue and you may want
to just turn off the messages.  This can be done via the prctl(2)
system-call or with the prctl command.  With the latter:
	prctl --fp-emul=silent
will fork a new shell and disable the printing of the FPSWA-messages
in the shell and all its children.  There is also "--unaligned=silent"
which will turn off a similar message for unaligned access emulation
done by the kernel.
