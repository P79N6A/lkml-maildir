OK, let's get this into 2.6.17 - it can't break anything and makes 
developers sooner aware of this.
Can we also create the rule that changing an EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL() back 
to an EXPORT_SYMBOL() requires an in-kernel user of the export? 
Otherwise all this "there is no stable API for external modules" saying 
starts to become nonsense.
If we give developers 6 months of EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL() warning this 
should be enough for them to submit their code for review and inclusion 
into the kernel.
