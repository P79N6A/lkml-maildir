I shouldn't oversimplify the power management in a cell phone. When I said we turned whole devices on/off, I was referring only to what the system-level PM (which uses suspend/resume) does. There's a fair amount of subsystem-specific power management outside the Linux suspend/resume framework. Some of it might be handled in the framework, if the framework were more capable.

I think we were talking multiple off modes for _single device_. It is good to know that even cellphones can get away with whole devices on/off today.
