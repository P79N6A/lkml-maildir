Thus providing me with a way to DoS your webserver by sticking all your
server processes into a sleep-forever... :)
You're also overlooking the fact that the malicious code could do something
like this:
	/* send the parent something that makes it *think* the request finished */
	printf("We're all done now\n");
	while (getpid()) msleep (1);
Remember - whatever the child is doing to signal that it's done, can *also*
be done by the exploit code. There's only one real exception - the child
can call exit() - if the exploit exits so a SIGCHLD is generated, then
it can't run anymore.  However, since the whole *point* here is avoiding
the usual exit/fork/exec overhead...
