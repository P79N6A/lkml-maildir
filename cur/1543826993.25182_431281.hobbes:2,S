Well, each of serial ports has hardware baud_rate register. I'll need
software baud_rate_shadow for every serial port, setting
baud_rate_shadow each time baud_rate is set. During resume, I restore
baud_rate from baud_rate_shadow for each serial port.
What am I missing?

Well, solution above is likely to be ugly, but even ugly patch would
help people debug s-to-RAM.
