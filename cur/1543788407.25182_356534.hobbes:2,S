Yes. My bad. 
That would be the prime suspect, especially as you don't seem to have any 
strange filesystems. Syscall auditing delays releasing filenames until the 
system call exits, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if it might leak.
I doubt you depend on the syscall auditing, so the easiest thing to try is 
to just disable it and see if the behaviour goes away. At that point, if 
it does, we have people we can ping to look more closely into what causes 
it.

Ahh, never mind. It sounds like the best thing to do is to first try the 
simple audit test, and if the problem remains, just apply one of the slab 
debugging patches.
There's one by Alexander Nyberg at least, which would probably show the 
likely leak site immediately since it tracked allocators. Alexander, do 
you have a recent version of that to send to Robert?
