Ok, a grep shows that possible culprits (i.e. giving success to
grep GENERIC_HARDIRQS arch/*/Kconfig, and using 0x4000000 as PREEMPT_ACTIVE, 
as given by grep PREEMPT_ACTIVE include/asm-*/thread_info.h) are (at a first 
glance): frv, sh, sh64.
After a bit of checking, I also verified if they had overriden the value of 
HARDIRQ_BITS. Which they haven't (it seems it's defined exactly where 
CONFIG_HARDIRQS is not used, i.e. nobody is using the ability to override it 
currently).
This was not a very deep investigation, however, so feel free to verify this 
better.
