Suppose we were to do it from kernel. What's the right way to create a cgroup
without mounting a cgroupfs ?
I just want to play with it. There are a couple of advantages that I see for
doing it from kernel. We can move 'kthreadd' and idle threads into the 'boot'
cgroup early on and therefor later on won't even have to iterate through the
tasks and stuff. Whereas user-space has to iterate through tasks and be smart
about threads that are pinned and stuff. Not a big deal but if kernel code is
simple enough maybe it makes sense.
So, any pointers. How do I do create_cgroup() without fs mounted ?
