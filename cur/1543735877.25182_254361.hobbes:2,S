	I have a script that does a first pass of converting an ipchains 
firewall script to an iptables firewall script at 
http://www.stearns.org/i2i/ipchains2iptables
http://www.stearns.org/i2i/ipchains2iptables.README
	Because of architectural differences between the two firewall 
technologies it can't produce a perfect translation, but it does handle 
most of the grunt work.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
