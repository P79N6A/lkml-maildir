well, indeed. While the sti() can be understood to a certain degree - we
used to boot with the IRQ lock on and accidentally leaving it enabled can
cause problems - but otherwise preceeding code should not disable
interrupts in an unbalanced way. I've removed the __sti() from my tree.
there's even more ancient code in the block driver init path, eg. in
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:blk_dev_init():
        outb_p(0xc, 0x3f2);
i suspect this is ancient Linux code. 0x3f2 is one of the floppy
controller ports - many modern x86 boxes do not even have a floppy
controller! I've removed this from my tree as well - if this is needed at
all then it belongs into the floppy driver. Latest patch is at:
