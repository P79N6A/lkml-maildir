Sigh... poll() API is _not_ thread-safe. It would make a lot of sense if
you would get _new_ (duplicate) descriptors as if you've received an
SCM_RIGHTS packet. The way it is defined you are getting an answer in
terms of descriptors you had when you had called poll(). Unless you've
done the protection in userland you are fscked, because they may have
completely different meanings when you return. Yes, it's asking for
trouble. Yes, inside the kernel such API would be fixed, just to avoid a
shitload of potential races. Unfortunately it's exported to userland, so
changing it is out of question.

Yup.

Not even to the process - to fdesc process group. I.e. descriptor-to-file
binding is a shared resource exposed to userland and should be treated as
such - with userland taking care about not stepping on its own toes.

Erm... Actually *BSD _does_ munmap() on close(). OTOH their handling of
shared descriptor tables is not just broken, it's dancing around with a
huge "screw me" sign on its arse (you can panic the box with UID==-2 and
_no_ permissions on any file or directory - having stdin opened is enough
to work with if you can call pipe(), rfork(), dup2() and close()).

Which is the reason why poll() turns out to be a dangerous thing in case
of shared file descriptor tables. Use with care. Kernel can't do anything
about that - if thread A call poll() and gets scheduled away immediately
after the return from the system call... just what could kernel do to stop
the thread B from closing one of descriptors and opening a new file?
Woops, A is thinking that descriptor 69 has something to read from, but
now 69 is not what it used to be when we returned from poll(). Same goes
for pipe(), open(), dup2(), socket() - whatever.
