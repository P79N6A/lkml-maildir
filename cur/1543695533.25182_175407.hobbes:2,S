On the flip side, if there's a lot of routines all declared 'static' so they are
only visible to that .c file, it's less than simple to split them out and
tell the *rest* of the projects that 'routines in interface/*.c are visible
to each other, but not to C code in database/*.c'.
The Linux kernel has the same issues:
% find . -name '*.[ch]' | xargs grep acpi_bus_unregister_driver
referenced only in drivers/acpi and one include file - but pollutes the global
linkage namespace all the same.
