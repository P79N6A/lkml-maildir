There is no relationship between the address returned from ioremap and
what you pass into io_remap_page_range().  ioremap gives you a kernel
virtual address for the PCI address you remap.  io_remap_page_range()
creates a userspace mapping in the same way, and you should pass in
the PCI address exactly the same way you pass in the PCI address into
ioremap.  io_remap_pfn_range() takes a PFN ("page frame number"),
which is basically the PCI address you want to map divided by
PAGE_SIZE.  The main reason for using PFNs is that they allow you to
map addresses above 4G even if sizeof long is only 4.
In your code:
 >      dev.pcibar2 = ioremap_nocache(resource,size);
 >      dev.region_start = dev.pcibar2 + offset;     // RAM is at some offset from base
This gives you a kernel mapping that you can use with readl(),
writel() etc to access the PCI memory from the kernel.
To map to userspace, this:
 >   if (io_remap_page_range(vma, phyaddr, vma->vm_start, vsize, vma->vm_page_prot))
should use phyaddr as you have it here:
 >   // phyaddr   = physical address of PCI memory area
This is just wrong:
 >   unsigned long phy            = __pa(dev->region_start + off);
__pa() doesn't work on addresses returned from ioremap.  Just use the
same resource address you passed into ioremap.
