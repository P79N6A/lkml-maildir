test6-pre5 doen't like to be shutdown and rebooted. At random
places while shutting down messages appear from /etc/rc.d/rc
saying that it cannot fork. pressing ctrl-alt-del again makes
init saying: cannot fork, retry.
alt-sysrq-m shows
	41MB free, 26MB normal, 14MB DMAable, L00 HighMem = 0kb free
alt-sysrq-t shows only a few processes with slight variation, including
	init
	kswapd
	kflushd
	kupdate
Symtom goes away when /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs is never started. During shutdown
it sometimes says:
	rpciod: active tasks at shutdown ?!
while it has never been mounted from.
Hardware is SMP, everything is a module.
2.4.0-test5 is ok.
