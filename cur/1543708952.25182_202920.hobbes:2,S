If only those were casts under arch/ppc64, sure.
All 32-bit ports and x86-64 are being affected.
Besides being ugly and verbose, the current situation
isn't type-safe.
I'd be interested to hear why you don't like the
approach, and interested to hear your alternatives.
For example:
a. my solution, as given
b. move u64 and friends to include/linux/*.h
c. you promise to never complain about warnings
d. printk("Ugly: " U64_FMT "\n", some_u64_value);
e. you patch gcc to modify format strings :-)
f. ...
In other words, how do you propose to eliminate
the casts?
