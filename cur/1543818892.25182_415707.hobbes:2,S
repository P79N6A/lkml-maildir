Has anyone ever used this driver to talk to a Sandisk
compact flash card running in true ide mode from a
big-endian host(ppc)?  Did you need to configure the
IDE disk driver as well? 
I'm getting a DRQ (Data request) error on every block
transfer from the device.  I've had to modify swap
bytes when doing the data read and make many other
changes just to get some life out of the card.
Please cc me personally as I'm not a subscriber...
