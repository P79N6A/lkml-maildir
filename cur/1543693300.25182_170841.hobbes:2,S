Hi Greg,
I just did a test run. There is still more free memory than with a stock 
kernel. I guess some cache entries aged dropped out of existence.
I guess more cache entries will be removed if I put memory pressure on the 
system.
Please correct me, if I am wrong, but sysfs dentry and inode caches are 
currently unswappable, right?
But now to the results:

By the way, I noticed, that this patch slows down the find.

That's good.  But what happens after you run a find over the sysfs tree?
Which is essencially what udev will be doing :)
