Back up to date with the other trees of the day, clear out some more
of the pending queue, some more shrinkage, and drop some more silly bits
that were spotted during patch splitting.
Size seems to be creeping up dramatically, but this is largely
due to large updates like the IDE bits (which will show up in .14 anyway)
Other big chunks are on their way to Linus later..
As usual,..
Patch against 2.5.13 vanilla is available from:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.5/
Merged patch archive: 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/patches/merged/
Check 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/Linux-2.5.html
 before reporting
known bugs that are also in mainline.
