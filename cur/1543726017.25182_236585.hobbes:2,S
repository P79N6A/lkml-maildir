Sorry, I'm reading via gmane and my newsreader doesn't make it
straightforward to do so.  But I'll do it manually for you.

Thanks, that does work for ext3, very well.  It's obvious that it
clears kernel page cache and not controller/disk cache.

OK thanks, I'll take on good faith that this is the best scheme in
general.  I was actually doing a somewhat different approach, reading
through a 2x memory "dummy" file before accessing the real file, but
based on your advice, I'll instead just create a 2x "dummy" file,
fsync it, and then delete it.
Thanks for the tips,
