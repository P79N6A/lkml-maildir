As far as I can see, they are not listed :-(.
static int sharp_probe_map(struct map_info *map,struct mtd_info *mtd)
{
        map_word tmp, read0, read4;
        int width = 4;
        tmp = map_read(map, base+0);
        sharp_send_cmd(map, CMD_READ_ID, base+0);
        read0 = map_read(map, base+0);
        read4 = map_read(map, base+4);
        if (read0.x[0] == 0x00b000b0) {
                switch(read4.x[0]){
                case 0x00b000b0:
                        /* a6 - LH28F640BFHE 8 64k * 2 chip blocks*/
                        mtd->erasesize = 0x10000 * width / 2;
                        mtd->size = 0x800000 * width / 2;
                        return width;
...I've removed unneccessary code, this path is actually taken. Does
it mean that mfr == id == 0x00b0? [Notice that comment is wrong there,
probably belongs to another chip :-(]

Thanks, Sharp!
