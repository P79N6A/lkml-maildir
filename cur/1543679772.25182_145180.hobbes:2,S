Has -mm had some monotonic clock patches at around 2.5.72-mm3?
2.5.74-mm1 seems to produce non-monotonic gettimeofday.
(tested with 
http://www.swcp.com/~hudson/gettimeofday.c
)
'lag' is sporadic and may take several iterations to come up.
Machine is 2xK7 with a ACPI C2 sleep driver (TSC's get unsynched).
2.5.72-mm3 didn't show these.
