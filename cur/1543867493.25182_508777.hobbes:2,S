That's an incorrect assumption.  Every task/thread in the system has FPU 
state associated with it, in part due to the fact that glibc has to change 
some of the rounding mode bits, making them different than the default from 
a freshly initialized state.

At which point task B has to touch the FPU in userspace as part of the 
cleanup, which adds back in an expensive operation to the whole process.
The whole context switch mechanism is a zero sum game -- everything that 
occurs does so because it *must* be done.  If you remove something at one 
point, then it has to occur somewhere else.
My opinion of this whole thread is that it implies that our thread creation 
and/or context switch is too slow.  If that is the case, improve those 
elements first.  At least some of those optimizations have to be done in 
hardware on x86, while on other platforms are probably unnecessary.
Fwiw, there are patches floating around that did AIO via kernel threads 
for file descriptors that didn't implement AIO (and remember: kernel thread 
context switches are cheaper than userland thread context switches).  At 
least take a stab at measuring what the performance differences are and 
what optimizations are possible before prematurely introducing a new "fast" 
way of doing things that adds a bunch more to maintain.
