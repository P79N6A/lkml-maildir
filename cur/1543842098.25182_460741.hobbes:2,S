Olaf will tell us (I don't have the hardware) but it's indeed a typical
thing .... From my experience, Adaptec tend to very easily throw PCI
aborts at you if it doesn't like something in a register access (which
isn't necessarily a bad thing btw, other vendors are more lenient tho),
and Macs are well known to Machine Check the box when getting a PCI
error while most x86 boxes silently ignore them...
