This would copy the to-be-initialized buffer somewhere, if it compiles.
1) You want stosd, "store string", not "move string"
2) You'll want to set %%di (destination index) instead of %%si.
3) repz should be illegal for movs, it might be interpreted as rep by
   defective assemblers, since it generates the same prefix. "rep" is
   correct here, since you don't want to break on (non-)zero-words.
4) Mind the direction flag.
