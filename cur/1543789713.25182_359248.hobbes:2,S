I got another one of these adapters, and when I plug the new one in I get:
usb 4-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
Bluetooth: HCI USB driver ver 2.8
usbcore: registered new driver hci_usb
hcid[30219]: Bluetooth HCI daemon
hcid[30219]: HCI dev 0 up
hcid[30219]: Starting security manager 0
Then I remove that one and plug in the original and get the old problem:
usb 4-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and  address 3
hcid[30219]: HCI dev 0 registered
usb 4-1: USB disconnect, address 3
hcid[1984]: Can't init device hci0: No such device (19 )
hcid[30219]: HCI dev 0 unregistered
So the old one I was using seems to be a bad device, I just want to ask 
if there are any other possibilities, other than bad hardware, before I 
get rid of it.
Thanks
