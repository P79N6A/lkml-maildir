However distateful it sounds, there is precedent for the
behavior that Doug is proposing in commercial clustering
implementations.  My recollection is that both Compaq TruCluster and
HP Service Guard have logic that will panic the kernel when a disk is
"stolen" from under a running service and there is a "network
partition" in the cluster.
A network partition occurs when multiple machines in the cluster are
runnig, but the HA software agents on two nodes can't communicate via
the network to arbitrate which node should be the owner of the disk.
