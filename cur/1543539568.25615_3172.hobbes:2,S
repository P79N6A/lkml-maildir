You missed the point. We all know clearly that root can do everything.
What Andre describes is more a bug: It is possible with surpass the ATA/IDE
specifications
by an awkward disk access commands (as can be found in disk-destroyer.c).
That means the kernel itself allows damaging your ATA/IDE hardware.
Lets look at another example:
Would you like an accepted call to a fbdev to burn your VGA-card
(overclocking/flash your bios/whatsoever) ?
Would you like an accepted call to a sound-device to kill your sound card ?
Surely the answer must be no.
I hope you see the difference between making a driver that has to stay
within the limits given by some specifications and a destructive attempt
that does not simply say open_ide_device( some illegal values) -> crash
(instead of open_ide_device returns error #0815 command not within
specifications) but needs to make all the illegal calls in very basic steps
from scratch.
The patch has to be applied to fix the BUG,
Soeren.
