true, i missed that :) but i also recall you saying you were thinking
of having no prioritization within SCHED_ISO ... or am i remembering
wrong? also, is it just me, or having to ways to achieve the exact
same result seems very un-linux-like ... and if they are not exact
same results, how does a regular user get the SCHED_FIFO ones? is the
answer just "they don't" ?
