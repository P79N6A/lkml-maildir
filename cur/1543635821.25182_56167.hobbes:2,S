A friend of mine had "subtle memory problems". He tested the memory
using memtest86. No errors running for hours. 
Then he did:
	bank1 = malloc (bignum); 
	bank2 = malloc (bignum); 
	srand (seed);
	bash (bank1);
	srand (seed); 
	bash (bank2); 
	if (memcmp (bank1, bank2) != 0)
		Memory error!
and quickly found a memory error on the first pass. 
It turns out you can memtest all you want, but different access
patterns may cause different errors. In some cases memtest86 doesn't
detect problems, while other stuff does.....
