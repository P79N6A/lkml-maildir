No idea - you've given very little information to go on.  I doubt
you're building an x86 kernel... Mind giving some clues and maybe
a copy of your .config file?
I regularly moan about overuse of the Kconfig "select" statement
and at a guess you've just been bitten by this.  Feel free to moan
like merry hell about it.

about 16 or so in most sane configurations.
