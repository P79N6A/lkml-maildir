Sean, I don't think I saw an answer when I asked you this before.  Why
is ib_addr exporting a workqueue?  Is there some sort of ordering
constraint that is forcing other modules to go through the same
workqueue for things?
This seems like a very fragile internal thing to be exposing, and I'm
wondering if there's a better way to handle it.
