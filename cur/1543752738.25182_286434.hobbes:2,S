It sounds to me like both your proposals may be too complex and not
sufficiently deterministic (I don't know for sure, maybe that's
exactly what the RT people want).
I wouldn't have thought it is so much a matter of having real-time-ish
scheduling available that tries to play nicely in a multi user machine.
That must still imply that either the user is able to unduly tie up
resources (and thus it has to be a privileged operation), or that it
sometimes can't meet its "guarantees" (in which case, is it useful?).
I was thinking that the solution might be more along the lines of
a nice way to handle privileges for these guys.
I could be completely off the rails though. I haven't really been
following this thread so please shoot me in my foot if I have put it
in my mouth.
