Insteresting that this thread fell into this.  I just had one of those
cards that came across my desk phreak out.  It was 2 days old and placed
in a win2k server.  Last night it started dumping errors about firmware
and bad microcde.
Have yet to test it out on another machine, but I beleive the card went
bad.  first 3com I have had go bad and first card I have ever had go bad
inside of 2 days :)
