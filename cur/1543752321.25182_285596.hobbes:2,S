You have used it for your own purposes :)
But I would argue that you used it in a way that works, and solves a
real need.  As the intent of this field was never really properly
conveyed, and since you were here first, hey, your implementation gets
to stay!

I like the "just add a firmware_data" field option too.  It doesn't
break any existing code, and the term "firmware" tells driver authors to
back away from it and not touch it (and we need to add the proper
documentation saying this.)
