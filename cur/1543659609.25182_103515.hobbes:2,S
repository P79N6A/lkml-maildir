Ok some mildly annoying bugs have already shown up in this release.
I've put up a contest-0.61pre on the contest website that addresses the one 
which ruins the results and has some of the changes going into 0.61

Major problem is that you need to run make oldconfig and make dep manually 
before running contest successfully the first time. This will be corrected by 
the time 0.61 comes out (probably by weekend).
