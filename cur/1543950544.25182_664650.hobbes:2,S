It simply decreases the remote chance later that we'll develop obscure 
header file dependencies for some archs like we saw with the memcontroller 
and the sparc build.  There are no strange dependencies that I am 
currently aware of, so this is not a bugfix.
The only way this would make things more fragile is if a header file 
removes an include for another header file without checking all the users 
of the former first and fixing it up in mm/mempolicy.c.
