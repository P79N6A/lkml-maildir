I've got the same problem with a number of 6xxx 3ware cards I've got.
I wish there was a simple way to monitor the raid status in /proc
without having to use their 3dm tools. You can monitor
/var/log/messages for 3ware errors, but then you'll still have to
reboot to get into the 3ware bios to do any maintenance.
