Thanks!
This looks sane to me.
BIOS reports two disk devices (int13_dev80,81), corresponding to the two
disks you report having.  The boot disk is a 60GB, the second disk is a
160GB.
In Jeff's case, the BIOS reported having devices which didn't actually
exist.  So this is definitely a different problem that Jeff's.
Your BIOS has some difficulty following the EDD specification (reports
incorrect PCI bus/dev/fn values, uses 0x00 instead of 0x20 (space) bytes
to pad out some text fields), but the rest of the EDD3.0 fields look
correct.
|   |-- hde
|   |   |-- device -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0f.0/ide2/2.0
|   |-- hdg
|   |   |-- device -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0f.0/ide3/3.0
while BIOS reports:
/sys/firmware/edd/int13_dev80/host_bus
PCI 	00:06.0  channel: 0
/sys/firmware/edd/int13_dev81/host_bus
PCI 	00:06.1  channel: 0
I don't have a clue why your BIOS would induce a 30-second delay when
being asked to read the disks for their MBR, either with the newer or
older read commands, unless the second disk isn't really spun up yet
during POST, and it's got to wait for that to happen.  But once the
disks are spinning, rebooting should not show the delay, and I believe
you claim it does still delay.  Once again, I'm at a loss.
Thanks,
Matt
