I agree; I actually checked this point: most page gang lookups do have
to restart the search.  At least using a bitmap gets it back on point
much faster.  The page radix tree lookups are usually at most four
levels deep, anyway.

 btw.
OK ... I'll take a look.  I didn't mean to do this, it's just that for
the idr replacement code I had to use bitmap lookup, so this seemed like
a natural precursor.

Well, not quite; with the size changes, the tag map now never overflows
an unsigned long.

yes, did that.

OK, I see how to do all of this using the currently implemented logic
(the occupied word is what you would like to be the present tag).  I'll
see what I can do.

radix_tree_insert() is reliable from IRQ provided you don't try to use
radix_tree_preload() and you defined your radix tree gfp flag to be
GFP_ATOMIC.  preloading is only optional, and should only be done really
if you have process context to preload with GFP_KERNEL.  Preloading with
GFP_ATOMIC is pretty pointless since radix_tree_insert() will also try
to allocate with the radix tree flags.
