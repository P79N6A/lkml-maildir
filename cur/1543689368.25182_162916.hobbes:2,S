All true, but multiple images isn't the only way to solve the problem
(I happen to like the idea, but let's go for full disclosure on all
possibilities ;-)). Take one example, the global pagemap_lru_lock in
2.4 ... either we could split the LRU by multiple OS images, or explicitly
split it per-node ... like we did in 2.6 (Andrew did that particular bit
of work IIRC, apologies if not).
The question is whether it's better to split *everything* to start with,
and glue back the global bits ... or start with everything global, and
split off the problematic bits explicitly. To date, we've been taking
the latter approach ... it's probably more pragmatic and evolutionary,
and is certainly a damned sight easier. The former approach is a fascinating
idea (to Larry and I at least, it seems ... now we've stepped over our
previous communication breakdown on one aspect at least), but unproven.
I wanna go play with it ;-)
