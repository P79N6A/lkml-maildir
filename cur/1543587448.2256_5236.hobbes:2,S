Not __alloc_pages() calls oom_kill() however do_page_fault(). Not the
same. After the system tried *really* hard to get *one* free page and
couldn't managed why loop forever? To eat CPU and waiting for
out_of_memory() to *guess* when system is in OOM? I don't think so, if
processes can't progress because system can't page in any of their
pages, somebody must go.

Yes, I think this is a problem. In page fault if OOM, "bad" process
selected, scheduled, killed and everybody runs happily even without to
notice system is low on memory. Fast and gracious process killing
instead of slow, painful death IF out_of_memory() correctly detects OOM.
