I had noticed that Vista wasn't using MSI for any devices and I
tried booting with pci=nomsi in addition to building the kernel
without MSI enabled (just in case there might somehow be a
difference). I see I should have mentioned it, but it had no effect
on the problem. The device gets IRQ 16 in Linux without MSI and it
still croaks with the same messages.
