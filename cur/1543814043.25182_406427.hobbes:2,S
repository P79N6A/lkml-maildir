Hmmm. I'm confusing again about this. :-(
Dave-san, Joel-san.
Why does Powerpc use __devinit for add_memory()?
Usually, add_memory() is never called at boottime.
So, I suppose __meminit nor __devinit is not needed at all around here.
But, does it have a plan that add_memory() is called only boottime on 
Powerpc?
