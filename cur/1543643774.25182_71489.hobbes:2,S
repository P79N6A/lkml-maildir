i'd rather do it the other way around - ie. do a:
	if (unlikely(current->state == TASK_ZOMBIE)) {
		... exit checks ...
	} else {
		... normal checks ...
	}
this test is cheaper than a function call. I'd say the ZOMBIE check alone
is not significant enough to introduce a function split in the hotpath.  
This check is also easier to remove later on.
TASK_ZOMBIE is only ever allowed to be set for exiting tasks. [and if
TASK_ZOMBIE handling is broken then it will trigger the normal atomic
tests so it's not like we are silently ignoring those errors.]
