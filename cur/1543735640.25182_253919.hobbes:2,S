they should yes. Only the anon_vma_lock can be dropped before vm_end
modifications (but only for vm_end, vm_start and vm_pgoff updates still
needs the anon_vma_lock hold to be coherent with vm_pgoff reads).
operations on memory-seeking data structures like lists and trees tends
to be the most likely to show bad ram, we had it for some time in the
dcache layer for the dcache shrinking (still todate AFIK they were all
hardware issues), this could be a similar case.
though I agree the same BUG_ON triggering worth a second check.
Thanks a lot!
