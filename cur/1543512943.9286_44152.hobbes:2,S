I was hoping somebody with POSIX in hand would quote. All I have is
sched_setscheduler(2), it says:
"In order to determine the process that runs next, the Linux scheduler
looks for the non-empty list with the highest static priority and
takes the process at the head of this list."
It makes no exception to processes that have called sched_yield().
