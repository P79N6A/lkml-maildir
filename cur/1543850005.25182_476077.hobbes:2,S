Are you saying you're against a stream of patches that belong together?
Well, I'm sorry but that's the way things work sometimes. I know
everyone loves this evolutionary model, but it just doesn't work in
practice. We see sets of patches going through all the time in which
[2/4] prepares the foundations for [3/4] and so on. That's what I'm
doing, I just don't yet know how big the n is in [2/n].
Regarding removing user.c, I said I'd rather, not that I'm going to
submit a patch to do it :)

(s/RCU/LRU applied to avoid confusion)

I'm not arguing for that.

Do you have a number for '_lot_'? It's easy to say, but it would be
better to be able to say "I counted n lines of code you could remove if
you didn't save a full image of memory".

I was thinking of coming at it from the other direction, since I expect
the pages that might be modified from an interrupt context to be
minimal. The fact that Suspend2 has worked for years now using this
algorithm seems to confirm that.
