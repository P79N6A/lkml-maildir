nowhere did i suggest that it should be default-enabled ...
i just suggest the obvious: please make it a trivial, 2 seconds flip of 
a switch, instead of a 60 minutes hunting which i had to do to enable 
the S2RAM self-test: which also meant i had to write a few patches to 
print out what the code does and why it does not work, to finally enable 
this critical test infrastructure.
damn, with that kind of attitude towards people who _want to help_, no 
wonder s2ram still sucks ;-)
