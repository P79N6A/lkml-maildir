Yes, but how many times this discussion already happened ?
I have nothing against the discussion happening ... As long as it 
doesn't happen a couple of times a year. That's what a list archive is 
for. The latest generation of Internet users, including some latest 
generation developers are in general LAZY about looking up archives, 
they want to post the question now and get an answer, while they could 
have gotten the answer without bothering anyone. Sure, it takes one a 
little more effort to search the archives, but that's one person's 
effort, while posting one message wastes hundreds (perhaps thousands) of 
people's time.
And also, the FAQ for the list states it quite clearly that the people 
doing usefull work here is only really interested in proof that 
something is better, performance and/or space wise, so if someone has an 
opinion, first go prove it on some piece of the kernel, the post their 
opinions along with the results to the list. That's the way to go. 
Maintenability is important, after speed, memory usage and portability. 
That's sound engineering, instead of C.S. dogmas.
