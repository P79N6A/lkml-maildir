Subject: [PATCH, RFC] Create 'slot' sysfs attribute in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/topology/
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Len, Tony,
A while back, I submitted a patch to expose the value of the _SUN
method for CPUs. On ia64, the "physical id" field in
/proc/cpuinfo isn't sufficient for some legacy HP ia64 platforms,
as they do not have a modern SAL or PAL.
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/30/529
That patch wasn't so great because as Len pointed out, /proc/acpi
is a deprecated interface.
Here is another try that attempts to present a generic "slot"
attribute in sysfs that leaves the various architectures free to
implement however they like.
Yes, I am aware of the physical_package_id attribute. However,
that doesn't necessarily map to a slot on the system board.
Additionally, it's broken on the same ia64 systems where
/proc/cpuinfo is broken, because it's trying to read the same
field. :-/
On ia64, I have a somewhat ugly implementation, where the ACPI
processor driver is filling in the answer. I chose this approach
because I couldn't figure out how to do it in the base CPU
driver, since calling the _SUN method requires the ACPI
interpreter to be initialized, and it didn't look like that was
the case when we did things like identify_siblings(), for
instance.
Finally, there is something that looks odd in struct
cpuinfo_ia64, where there are now two #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
statements. I did this because adding the new 'slot' member
created a 4-byte hole in the struct. It felt a little cleaner to
me to move the 'int cpu;' member upwards to fill in the hole, and
then my 'slot' could take the spot of 'cpu'.
I'd like to get feedback on both:
	- the concept in general of creating a new sysfs
	  attribute
	- the ia64 implementation, specifically
Thanks.

Physical slot information for CPUs is important for many reasons,
including managability. For instance, if a platform supports
physical CPU hotplug, it would be nice for the user to know which
physical CPU module to actually unplug after offlining it.
The "physical id" field in /proc/cpuinfo is broken/missing on
older ia64 platforms that do not have modern firmware.
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/topology/physical_package_id exists,
but is broken on those same platforms because it's simply reading
the same field that would have been presented in /proc/cpuinfo.
Create a 'slot' attribute and define an interface that may be
populated via alternate sources, without breaking existing
functionality.
Implement this interface on ia64 by invoking the _SUN method on a
per cpu basis.
Leave other archs alone for now.
