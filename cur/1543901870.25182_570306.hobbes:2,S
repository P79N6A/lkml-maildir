Hi, Paul/Andrew
Would you accept this fix, while we wait for the complete solution.
It worked for me quite well.
Description
Stop checking if the container can be released every time we do css_put().
A better solution that avoids container_mutex has been suggested by
Paul, but meanwhile, to get containers working correctly, this fix
would be very useful.
