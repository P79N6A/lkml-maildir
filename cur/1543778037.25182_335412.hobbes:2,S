I hope the broader exposure will break the EC patch on
another machine (besides your rare Asus) so that we
can figure it out and get it fixed for everybody.
Re: the S3 interrupt resume issue.  We're hoping to fix
the most common drivers before the release ships; and
we'd like to have a method to detect when drivers
do not release their interrupt so that we can at
least have a warning to the user to unload the
offending module until it gets fixed.
thanks for your support,
