I have attached lspci -vvvxxx from 2.5.65-mm2. Maybe  
you can see something strange here (cause I must  
admit I don't understand a thing of it).

Well, I've investigated a little more and this is what I found 
until date: 
  
1. The benchmarks I did with 2.4.20 were *not* using  
kernel built-in PCMCIA support, but SF's "pcmcia-cs".  
This means that the 3Com driver is different (and I also 
suspect that yenta socket driver is also different): when  
using 2.4.20's built-in PCMCIA support, my 3CCFE575CT  
uses 3c59x kernel module, but "pcmcia-cs" uses a  
different driver: 3c575_cb. 
  
2. I have tried doing benchmarks with RedHat's own  
kernel (based on 2.4.20 with many Alan Cox patches),  
using built-in PCMCIA and 3c59x driver and it *does*  
have the same problems that I'm seeing with 2.5, that  
is, it takes 4 times more time to send than to receive.  
 
3. I've been unable to use "lspci" on my 2.4.20 kernel 
with SourceForge's pcmcia-cs. It complains that 
"/proc/bus/pci/06" does not exist. For some reason, 
when using "pcmcia-cs", CardBus is not mapped 
as a PCI bus. 
  
So, it seems it's not a 2.5 specific problem, as I can  
reproduce it with a 2.4 kernel. It seems more a problem  
with the CardBus/PCMCIA and 3Com modules.

Well, I haven't done this comparison as the problem  
is reproducible either with 2.5 or 2.4 kernels. I do only  
get full bandwidth when using SourceForge's  
pcmcia-cs proyect.  
  
I have to do some more tests, but meanwhile, do you 
have any ideas? What's next? 
 
Thank you very much!
