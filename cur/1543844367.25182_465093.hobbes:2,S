It's correct from the standpoint of it being reaped in another thread,
so it fixed those crashes. But I pushed it down into another thread at the
request of Esben and his private discussion with Paul McKenney, since
a summary from Esben felt that call_rcu() was somehow less than ideal to
do that.

Unfortunately no. I even used Robert's .config on my machine. I added a
disk controller and networking device driver just to boot into his
configuration and I still couldn't replicated any of his kjournald problems
at all. If I had his hardware I'd have a better way of replicating those
problems and pound it out.
