Now, wait, Jeff.  I'm not attached to Peter's change, but I don't think
we can reasonably be expected to worry about every possible driver
left over from every old version of Linux when managing the
configuration-symbol namespace.  That way madness lies.
I'll cheerfully ship a supplementary patch to fix this one name later,
but we can't afford to have a wrangle over this bit of trivia delay
adoption of this one.  I have a hell of a lot of work to do for
which this is critical path.  
I left it pretty late as it is, out of hope that other people would
clean up some of the messes I noticed in the config namespace six
months ago, and they did -- but the 2.5 fork is nearly upon us and I
feel a strong need to get this in before then.
Would you and Peter please fight this out and tell me what to do in the
supplementary patch?  I don't care, as long as the result has a non-numeric
prefix -- bare "8139whatever" is out.
