OK, what your estimage for this then?
It would be nice to have all this stuff in 2.6.24, which doesn't leave
a lot of time.
But if it's just those four options you mentioned, it should be
managable.  I do not think there needs to be some generic code to
hande userspace-only options, it would be perfectly fine just to
parse, store and show them like all the other options.
