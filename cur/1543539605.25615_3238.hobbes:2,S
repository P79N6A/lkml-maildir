[Explanation how wrong firmware uploading process can screw you hardware skipped]
This is all right. But you can SIGN firmware blob and hardware will just
refuse to accept update with bad sign. How much it cost ? I have SmartCard
from Oberthur here where such protection is implemented. This card cost less
then 3$. Complete with CPU, memory, built-in DES (used for signature checking
in TripleDES mode) and so on. Since IDE/ATAPI drive (or you modem) ALREADY have
CPU, memory it'll add perhaps few CENTS to cost and will give you almost 100%
protection. Do we really need to tolerate hardware with ability to destroy it
with few simple commands just to save few CENTS per computer ?
