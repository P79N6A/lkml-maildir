yes. This warning caught a couple of bugs, and documented a couple of 
'fishy' places. Sometimes it's code that is totally correct. I think 
it's worth the extra iteration, there arent that many non-nested 
unlocking places.
straight nested unlocking is also best for performance and scalability: 
the outmost lock should be released last, because that's what the 
waiters are most likely to be blocking/spinning upon.
nevertheless i'll turn that warning into a less scary message.
