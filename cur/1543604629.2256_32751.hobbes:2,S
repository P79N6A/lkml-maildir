I'd say 1.  If a device is hotpluggable or not does not matter.  For
2.5, the boot process will be able to load modules for all PCI
devices seen in the system.  In order for that to happen, they need to
use the MODULE_DEVICE structure and the 2.4 pci driver subsystem.
(which it looks like almost none of the current SCSI driver do...)
