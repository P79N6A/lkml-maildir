I'll fix this:
security/integrity_dummy.c: In function 'dummy_inode_setxattr':
security/integrity_dummy.c:94: warning: implicit declaration of function 'capable'
security/integrity_dummy.c:94: error: 'CAP_SYS_ADMIN' undeclared (first use in this function)
security/integrity_dummy.c:94: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
security/integrity_dummy.c:94: error: for each function it appears in.)
Then I'll ask you to fix these, some of which are real bugs:
security/integrity_dummy.c: In function 'dummy_verify_metadata':
security/integrity_dummy.c:30: warning: 'error' may be used uninitialized in this function
security/integrity_dummy.c:28: warning: 'value' may be used uninitialized in this function
security/integrity_dummy.c:29: warning: 'size' may be used uninitialized in this function
And then I'll probably end up fixing some of this lot too:
security/evm/evm_main.c: In function 'evm_verify_xattr':
security/evm/evm_main.c:165: warning: format '%d' expects type 'int', but argument 5 has type 'ssize_t'
security/evm/evm_crypto.c: In function 'update_link_hash':
security/evm/evm_crypto.c:94: warning: implicit declaration of function 'kernel_readlink'
security/evm/evm_crypto.c: In function 'evm_init_integrity':
security/evm/evm_crypto.c:187: warning: format '%d' expects type 'int', but argument 4 has type 'size_t'
security/evm/evm_main.c: In function 'init_evm':
security/evm/evm_main.c:903: warning: control may reach end of non-void function 'evm_ima_init' being inlined
How does stuff like this get through?  It's just x86_64 allmodconfig.
