I have been running 2.2 on many machines since its release and have updated
to the latest version of 2.2 many times.  All of these machines have an
eepro100 and I never saw a single problem with any of them.  I updated most
of my machines to 2.4 over the course of a week and within a day of updating
each of them showed the problem.  This may be pure chance but it sounds to
me as if it is a difference with the 2.4 kernel.

The irony is that Bill Gates claims to be making a stable operating system
and Linus Torvalds claims to be trying to take over the world
