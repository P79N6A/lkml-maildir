You can't sleep holding a lock. You also can't null the hwgroup that
way and you have to deal with some other locking concerns. Have a look
how HDIO_*_RESET is handled in the very latest 2.4/2.5-ac code and
you should be able to follow from that. Note your code paths will be
much like the ioctl as the existing reset code paths are for paths
where we abort from a known safe state (drive initiated or locked).
With the stuff there now you should be able to abort the command
fairly cleanly and then reset the interface.
