Hi,
I have a need to programmatically determine whether or not hyperthreading
is enabled (and in use) for licensing reasons in my application.
Currently, I know of two ways to do this:
1) parse /proc/cpuinfo for "processor id"
2) port Intel's documented method (written for Windows) to directly query
the CPUs
Both methods have drawbacks - 1) relying on specific text that could change
is a bad idea; 2) this doesn't take into account whether or not Linux
and/or the BIOS is making use of the hyperthreading.
From scouring the archives and the net, it doesn't seem like there's any
API that currently exists, but perhaps I've missed something.
/proc/cpuinfo gathers its information from somewhere - is there a way in
userland to bypass /proc/cpuinfo and directly get this data manually?
I'm interested in both 2.4 and 2.6 implementations and would like to be
personally CC'ed on any repsonses.
Thanks in advance!
Dan Behman.
