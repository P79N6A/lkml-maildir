two more small details i noticed:
 - does it do proper self-test? It doesnt seem so at first sight.
 - i'd suggest a rename patch that does UNLIKELY_PROFILE => BRANCH_PROFILING.
    [ 'to profile' is the verb we use generally (it's a noun too but 
       we tend to use 'profiling' for that in other places of the
       kernel) - so we already have CONFIG_PROFILING, etc. ]
