Subject: [PATCH 3/6] IOPL handling for paravirt guests

I found a clever way to make the extra IOPL switching invisible to
non-paravirt compiles - since kernel_rpl is statically defined to
be zero there, and only non-zero rpl kernel have a problem restoring IOPL,
as popf does not restore IOPL flags unless run at CPL-0.
