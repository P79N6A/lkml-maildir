If you're talking about using the embedded image viewer in kde, that 
spins on wait and wastes truckloads of cpu (a perfect example of poor 
coding). Try loading it an external viewer and it will be 1000 times 
faster. If you're talking about it keeping the disk too busy on the 
other hand, that's I/O scheduling.
