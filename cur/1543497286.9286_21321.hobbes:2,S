   UGH!  Please don't kludge around the broken bottom half handling in 2.2. 
   I've offered the patch below, and received a couple of good comments.  2.2
   as-is will not run a bottom half if it was marked while bottom halves were
   being run (this affects the serial driver when using ppp (SERIAL_BH ->
   NET_BH), and any other driver that uses IMMED_BH to defer things) which is
   pretty broken if you ask me.
This may be, but please note your patch doesn't address Pavel's original
problem of trying to run very high speed serial ports through the tty
flipbuf.  He was dealing with a completely different problem.
