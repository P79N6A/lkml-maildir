Hi Muli,
I have tried to work with CCR ,CSR, CSMR, CSAR, CFGRW, GBRERRM  
registers but have been unable to make calgary generate an exception 
upon error condition.  In alloc_tce_table() , I am setting WRITE_ONLY 
access permission bit to tce entries but it isn't helping.  Would you 
kindly let me know how we can make calgary to generate an exception in 
error conditions ?.
Thanks,
Chandru
