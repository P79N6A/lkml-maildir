Hi,
I'm currently porting linux to TI's TMS320C31. I'm using c4x-gcc, which 
has a problem with the ENTRY-macro from linkage.h. c4x-gcc will accept 
the generated .globl-directive only if it is preceded by whitescape. 
Right know, gcc thinks I want to create a label called .globl. Any ideas 
how to fix this without fixing gcc?
Regards, Uwe
