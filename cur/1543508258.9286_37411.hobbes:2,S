Depends on the number of commands per seconds you need.
I can get up to 13000 actual 1K I/O READs per seconds on a single LVD BUS
with useless kernel buffering under 2.0.36 using 2 fast disks and 2 reader
processes (1 per device to overlap driver+controller+interrupt+etc... 
latencies). I just disable readahead for the block devices and read 1K
chunck at a time. May-be I could get slightly more cmds/sec by eliminating
kernel buffering (or under recent kernel), but I am too lazy to hack for
that. 
The machine is a PII/233 with 66MHz system bus and 33 MHz 32bit PCI BUS,
controller can be a SYM53C896 or 895. 
In my immediate opinion, it could well be some latency in some device,
likely the controller, that makes the commands/second throughput not being
as good as you expect. 
Gérard.
