Let me drop one of my pet complaints here, that the install programs of
many (most? all?) commercial releases don't give you a stripe size menu
to let the user make a decision based on intended use. Instead the
program uses the "one size fits all" approach and picks a size. As you
say here it's not unreasonable in terms of being typical, but for most
people it such for performance. As you noted elsewhere big stripes are
almost always better, and a default of 256k or so would work better for
most people.
Sorry, related flamage, but your comments welcome, since this does
affect the perception of performance of the o/s.
