Good point.
Check this out.  Rather than explaining it, I've attached it to this 
email.  It might solve this problem.  It's based on an idea I stated 
earlier.  I haven't quite worked out the details yet and I'm not really 
even sure if it's the best thing to do.  I created a sample interface 
comprised of folders and links and then tarred and gzipped it.  I'm 
looking forward to some reactions on it. (look in ./driver)
Also I have two questions:
1.)  Is it worth it to remove the bus interface?
my answer:    I think it is because an interface in which drivers can 
have children is far more flexable and scaleable.  Also it would result 
in less code.  I'm looking for some feedback so I can revise my current 
efforts.
2.) Should driver management occur through driver model interfaces?
my answer:    I already have the code to do this, it's just a matter of 
what's the best way to manage drivers.  I feel that the driver model is 
the best place because it offers the most flexability and it allows for 
control over all drivers, not just modules.
Thanks,
Adam
PS: I'm currently working on a patch that just implements the read for 
"driver" as discussed earlier.
