Hello!
> I'll try to reproduce this here and see happens...
Please... My experience tells me that route leaks are almost
impossible to find before I am able to reproduce them.
Please, monitor ip_dst_cache in /proc/slabinfo, periodically
flushing cache and try to guess the point, when it starts to grow.
Yes, you can also make "ip -o route ls cache | wc" and subtract
it from ip_dst_cache to get number of dead routes.
