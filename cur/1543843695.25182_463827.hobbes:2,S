as i said, roughly half of the tracepoints are like this - and some of 
them in functions in frequented places. That's far from "virtually no 
maintainance overhead". In the -rt tree i have never more than a dozen 
static tracepoints, yet even this small amount caused at least 5 extra 
-rt tree iterations due to various breakages (build problems or even 
crashes). Cruft comes in small steps, and my worry is that such 
_unremovable_ markups will be cruft that never shrinks. With dynamic 
tracers i see the _chance_ for cruft to shift to places where it does 
not hurt, if that cruft turns out to become a hindrance.
