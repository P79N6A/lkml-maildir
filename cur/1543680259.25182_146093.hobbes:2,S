Some of them have issues with PCI resource allocation though.  Their BIOSes
don't allocate resources to Cardbus bridges so insertted devices can't get
resources and last i checked, we didn't handle this fixup.  On the notebooks
I worked with it required relocating the AGP bridge and several other devices
to make all the resources work out (quick hack is to just shove new resources
into the config registers prior to the kernel's initial pci scan).
