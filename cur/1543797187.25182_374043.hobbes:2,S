Well that depends on the implementation.  The first concern with
the implementation is of course maintainability.
But beyond that a general test to see if you have done a good
job of virtualizing something is to see if you can recurse.
One of my wish list items would be to run my things like my
web browser in a container with only access to a subset of
the things I can normally access.  That way I could be less
concerned about the latest browser security bug.
Although I do expect that just like private namespaces it will
take a while to figure out how to allow non-privileged access
to these kinds of powerful concepts.
In the bsdjail paper the point is made that as systems grow
more complex creating minimal privilege containers is easy
and simple compared to what it takes to get a complex system
up and going today.  (I expressed that badly)  
And then of course there is the other pipe dream if you can
consider the whole system in a container then you can implement
the equivalent of swsuspend by checkpointing the top level
container.
At least this should solve the classic complaint about job
control.  That it wasn't transparent to processes.

Sorry do a man sigaction.  Basically the signal handler
needs to be configured with SA_SIGINFO but it should get
that information.  
I believe you have to
