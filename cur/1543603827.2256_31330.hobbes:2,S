The idle-task might be (ab-)used for this, because it has perfect
data for this.
T_SystemElapsed - T_IdleTaskRun = T_CPULoaded
Balancing could be done in schedule() itself, after checking this
value for each CPU.

If a artificial CPU-hog is used for this task, the idle task will
never be run and power savings in the CPU are impossible.
Other parts sound interesting.
