Hi,
Here are some i2c driver fixes and updates for 2.6.11-rc1.  There is a
new chip and a new bus driver, as well as a bunch of minor fixes.  All
of these patches have been in the past few -mm releases.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/i2c-2.6
Individual patches will follow, sent to the sensors and linux-kernel
lists.
thanks,
greg k-h
