Not this time of the night at least since amanda is doing her nightly 
thing ATM.  But thats not an impossible task, just time consuming.  
Right now, 40 minutes into the backup, seti is only getting 20% of 
the cpu, and I'd expect the run to be finished by about 3:50.  Kernel 
is 2.4.22-rc2 ATM.
Tomorrow nite, I'll be running the 2.6.0-test3 kernel, and will kill 
seti just before amanda starts and see how long it takes.
Then thursday I'll be running the deadline scheduler just for 
comparison, again without seti, and I'll relate the results.
Unrelated question:  I've applied the 2.6 patches someone pointed me 
at to the nvidia-linux-4496-pkg2 after figuring out how to get it to 
unpack and leave itself behind, so x can be run on 2.6 now.  But its 
a 100% total crash to exit x by any method when using it that way.
Has the patch been updated in the last couple of weeks to prevent that 
now?  It takes nearly half an hour to e2fsck a hundred gigs worth of 
drives, and its going to bite me if I don't let the system settle 
before I crash it to reboot, finishing the reboot with the hardware 
reset button.
Better yet, a fresh pointer to that site.
