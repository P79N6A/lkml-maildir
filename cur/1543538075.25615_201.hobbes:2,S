Hi all,
I am experince similar problems on my alpha with de4x5 ( which works )
and rtl8139C ( which doesnt ).
My alpha is an 21164 Alcor system. On my Dual PIII System, everything
seems to work fine, here´s what I do:
I start up my alpha and force ping it with -s 32000 and network doesnt
respond on the rtl8139, but the other card ( with different address ) is
still responsive. now i can do ifconfig eth0 down / ifconfig eth0 up and
everthing works fine until a certain amount of time ( or bytes ?? ) has
gone through the rtl8139 or until I force ping it again ...
