My thought was that the calculation seems to be misleading. The loop
process isn't taking up any CPU time. My applications are running
faster than ever. I'm guessing that ps (and /proc/loadavg) need to make
the distinction between:
1. uninterruptable sleep - where the process is blocking but taking
0CPU
2. uninterruptable sleep - I/O is happening using CPU
But I may not understand what uninterruptable sleep is supposed to
mean.
Take sendmail for example. Its default configuration for Linux won't
send attachments if the machine's load is too high. If I have 8 loop
devices in use and the load is at least 8, this may affect how sendmail
operates.
