I would've said 5 parallel implementations of inode->i_op simply given
the nature of the operations, which is entirely sane.

This is where I'm not understanding your argument.  The hardware is
somewhat irrelevant since the OS is running on a platform presented by the
hypervisor.  And the point is to allow multiple implementations of the OS
opertations that interact with the platform.  And in essence all network
stacks and file systems are doing the same thing with the same hardware.
Here's the reality.  None of these hypervisors will be ABI compliant in
the way syscalls are (namely trap insn and hypercall number).  So there's
a bunch of glue wherever you design the system.  Your arguement is that in
some (arguably random) instances it makes sense to push the glue into
the ROM.  This idea that lguest and KVM come from the same source tree
is irrelevant when the issues you site are about support matrices (which
means that guest and host may not have come from the same source afterall).
I still don't understand your issue.
thanks,
