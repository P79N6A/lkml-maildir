How do device interrupts get assigned to processors on an MP system?
Do they:
	all interrupt the same processor?
	get distributed among all the processors somehow?  If so, how?
	all interrupt all the processors, and they race to handle them?
	something else?  If so, what?
The reason I'm asking is that I'm doing the groundwork for MP emulation in the 
user-mode port, and I'm going to implement a more realistic device model as 
part of the deal.
