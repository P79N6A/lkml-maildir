In case of vital system libraries we would just do what HJ Lu had
already
done before. Just get it from the hands of the fanatics (read the last 
LGPL version) and don't care about them anylonger. Second I'm just 
eagerly awaitig the day the egcs project stops to claim the need to 
sign any paperwork to contribute...
And in fact there seems genearlly to be a trend to move away from the
FSF
those times now.
