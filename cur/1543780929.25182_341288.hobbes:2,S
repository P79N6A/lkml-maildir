Hmm, so what do I do in the following scenario - I have a serio port
(AUX) that has a synaptics touchpad bound to it which is driven by
psmouse driver. psmouse driver registers a child port (synaptics
pass-through) during probe call. The child port is also driven by
psmouse module - but it looks like it will deadlock when binding.
Am I missing something here?
