Another problem could be - as you point out - PCI bus saturation/flooding,
starving other PCI devices (a bit at least). For this, ensure you have
'passive release' and 'delayed transaction' engaged in the server's BIOS.
Although, being a branded server, these options may not be present, and on
by default. This will require a reboot and visit to the BIOS setup menu,
that's the only trouble. Heh.
