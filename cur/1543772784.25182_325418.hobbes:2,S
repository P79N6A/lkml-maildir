Of coz EIO is not always right. But suppose the same unplug action 
results different errors, just because of FS type? You think both EIO
and EROFS are right, what if new FS return EXXX? Even it's correct, the
community should AT LEAST define a set of error values which are 
considered right. So, the application user can handle these errors one
by one. If not, that means errno can't provide enough info, that's the
case of 3)c
Well, I give question 1) 2) and 3), they're just examples. FS developers
use 'de facto' standard, it's ambiguous. We need an accurate one.
