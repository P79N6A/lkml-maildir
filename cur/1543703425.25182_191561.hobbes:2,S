++int kgdbeth_thread(void *data)
++{
++      struct net_device *ndev = (struct net_device *)data;
++      daemonize("kgdbeth");
++      while (!ndev->ip_ptr) {
++              schedule();
++      }
++      debugger_entry();
++      return 0;
Don't you need some locking around ndev->ip_ptr? [Okay, it probably
only matters on SMP, so it is not causing your problems..]
