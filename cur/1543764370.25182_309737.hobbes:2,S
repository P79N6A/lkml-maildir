That sounds draconian. Where is that requirement stated?
A preempt-disabled region ought to have the same semantics
as in a CONFIG_PREEMPT=n kernel, and since schedule is Ok
in the latter case it should be Ok in the former too.
All that preempt_disable() should do is prevent involuntary
schedules. But the conditional schedules introduced by may-sleep
functions are _voluntary_, so there's no reason to forbid them.
