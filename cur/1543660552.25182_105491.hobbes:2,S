Interesting...  The patch goes cleanly onto newer kernels so feel
free to play with them.  You are running a single cpu system
so the kexec-hwfix patch should not make a difference at this point.
Your interrupt routing is via ACPI interesting...

Given that everything else was working correctly this is almost
certainly an e100 driver or a hardware bug.  On x86 everything has
been working well enough that finding something that is not a
hardware/driver bug as a failure case is currently quite a challenge.
Q1: Is this reproducible?
Q2: Is this reproducible with the eepro100 driver?
You were doing the easy case of 2.5.52 to 2.5.52 I have gotten so many 
false positives with things working when I reboot the exact same kernel
I barely consider it a valid test case any more...
If it is a bug in the driver a shutdown method can be used to clean up
before reboot to place the device is a quiescent state. 
Either that or the drivers initialization code can be enhanced to
handle more strange states.  
I know the eepro100 driver issues a reset before playing with the
card.  The e100 driver is doing this in a different order, and it is
dying before it resets the card so that looks like the issue to me.
Doing a clean user space shutdown may also help.  Though your kexecwrapper
script looked like it was probably doing that o.k.
