This makes things even easier!!!
When you create a cpuset, set the refcount to 0.  The root
cpuset is the exception and has a refcount of 1.
When tasks are added to the cpuset, increment the refcount.
When child cpusets are created, increment the refcount.  Each
cpuset has a list of children that is protected by a single
lock.
Whenever you are decrementing the cpuset's refcount, use
atomic_dec_and_lock on the parents child list lock.  If the
notify_on_release property is set, you remove the child from
the list.
When the vfs code is traversing the list, you need to ensure
that it does not iterate unless the child list lock is held.
I have not looked at how you implemented the vfs stuff, but
that should be easily accomplished.
Where are the holes?
Thanks,
Robin
