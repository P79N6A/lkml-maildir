All of the legacy stuff - VGA, Vesafb, PS2, serial, parallel,
joystick, floppy, gameport, etc. Those drivers could be in initramfs
and only load if the hardware is found. Most of these legacy devices
have poor sysfs support too. Also, it's not just x86 legacy device all
of the platforms have them.
Currently you have to compile most of this stuff into the kernel.
