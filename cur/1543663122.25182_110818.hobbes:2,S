Certainly IP_PKTINFO can be used with sendmsg.  The doesn't change the
fact that the documentation clearly says that the information is
information about an incoming packet.
Also, th only documentation I can find does not specify that a value
of 0 means "no specific interface is selected".  So while I can see
from the code that what you suggest would work in practice, it would
be nice if this were clearly documented somewhere.
