Subject: [PATCH][KGDB] Drop 'E' packet support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi.  After working on the docs a bit based on the textfile from Anurekh
Saxena, I'd like to commit the following patch (and similar hunks to the
i386-lite and x86_64 patch) to drop support for the 'E' packet.
This isn't something supported by stock GDB, nor AFAIK is it something
that's been submitted for inclusion in GDB.  So I'd really like to drop
this entirely until it's something gdb CVS supports (and I assume would
be documented in
http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_33.html#SEC656
 ).
I could stand putting off the question for now and putting it in the
non-lite patches, but I'd really rather not.
If no one objects, I'd like to commit this noon, -0700 on 30 March.
