You mean spooling to a raw parition when non-swappable RAM is overrun ?

Yeah, maybe I'm being completely naive in myunderstanding of buss
bandwidth sharing, but I refuse to accept the *above* given what
modern graphics hardware can do with AGP2 and disk controllers
with DMA.
How about a special optimization to the swap that allows for
high speed handling of linear page faults ?
If I'm hardware lock/bandwidth stupid, then please correct me.

I'm doing real time *non-so-critical* digital audio here. ;-)
Currently listening to the song snippet:
"...Brass Monkey, that funky monkey...." --Beasty Boys
