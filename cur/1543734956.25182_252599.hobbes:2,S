This would  end up  as hideous misfeature  as you can't  guarantee the
device to show up *at* *all*.
The reason udev is there is that we can dynamically respond to created
device nodes and  devices that show up. They  might have changed since
the last boot. Maybe they don't show up at all.
Thus you should trigger your actions from /etc/dev.d.
