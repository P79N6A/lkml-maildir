A couple of days ago I posted a report about my problems with ieee1394 
mass storage devices to the list. Here is an update.
Meanwhile Ben Collins contacted me and recommend me to try out some sbp2 
module options.
It turned out the "stall and timeout" problem can be suppressed by using 
the sbp2_serialize_io=1 module param when loading module sbp2. This 
works for me with several devices I have tested.

Kai
