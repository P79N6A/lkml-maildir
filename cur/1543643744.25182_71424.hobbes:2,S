I think that this would be a good improvement. Big database and
application servers would definitely benefit from it, desktops could
easier use tmpfs as temporary file systems.
I never dared to do it with my limited time since I feared deadlock
situations.
Also I ended up that I would try to go one step further: Make the
index pages swappable, i.e. make the directory nodes normal tmpfs
files. This would even make the accounting right.
