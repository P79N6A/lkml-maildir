Subject: x86_64: potential critical issue with quicklists and page table pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

git commit 34feb2c83beb3bdf13535a36770f7e50b47ef299 started using quicklists
for freeing page table pages and removed the usage of tlb_remove_page()
And looking at quicklist_free() and quicklist_free_page(), on a NUMA platform,
this can potentially free the page before the corresponding TLB caches
are flushed.
Essentially quicklist free routines are doing something like
__quicklist_free()
	...
	if (unlikely(nid != numa_node_id())) {
		__free_page(page);
		...
	}
	....
Now this will potentially cause a problem, if a cpu in someother node starts
using this page, while the corresponding TLB entries are still alive
in the original cpu which is still freeing the page table pages.
This violates the guideline documented in
http://developer.intel.com/design/processor/applnots/317080.pdf
This potentially can cause SW failures and hard to debug issues like
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0205.2/1254.html
Can we revert this commit for 2.6.23 and look at this code post 2.6.23?
thanks,
suresh
