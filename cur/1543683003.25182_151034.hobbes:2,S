Can you try echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep? echo 3 breaks it, too, but that
is little harder to set up.

Actually, as PCI interrupts are shared, I do not find that too

In case of hcd_panic(), where is interrupt deallocated?

That would be good. I definitely had another failure path, where it
did not tell me that hcd is no K.O...
