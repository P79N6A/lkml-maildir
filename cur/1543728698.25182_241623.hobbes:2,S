I have one question: Are kernel frame pointers required for the latency
traces? I had frame pointers on in my kernel config but wonder if they
are nessecary or if i can save the cycles and kb [i'm not too big on
kernel internals, so forgive the possibly stupid question]?..
The other thing i wanted to say is: way to go man!! These patches rock
my linux audio world. A big thank you from me and [probably] the whole
linux audio community for the work you put into this!
Compiling O7 right now with traces enabled, so i'll send a trace soon
about the ca 300 us latencies i see.
