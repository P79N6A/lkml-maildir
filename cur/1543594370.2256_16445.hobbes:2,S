Aha! A software weenie! A real hardware hacker would have snipped and
soldered it to VCC to get a constant (or add a switch for solid/blink =).
In any case, this strikes me as a matter of policy. I don't care one way
or the other, but if people want a solid cursor, it's not something that 
we can really deny them that (unless it's a binary-only driver for the
cursor, of course).
Anyway, this is a silly discusson in general, i figured i would throw in
my $0.02 (strong US cents!)
