	This is indeed most curious.  A co-worker pulled me aside the
other day and pointed out a large number of "--- MARK ---" messages
scrolling down the screen of his FreeBSD compile server.  I had no
clue what it meant, and probably won't until I check the ever so 
handy source code (enjoying a decent dinner right now.. too much
 kernel source ruins the appetite...)
Regards,
Daniel
