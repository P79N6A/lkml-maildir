Why not use "dev=ATAPI:/dev/hdd" or whatever device in /dev/ is
your burner...?

Sth. seems to be wrong here. When I do this as user I get

Use of ATA is preferred over ATAPI.

so it seems that your kernel is still blocking some command in the userland.
This might cause your problems, because I get the same write modes as user
that I get as root. I use 2.6.9 but have allowed some more commands for
users. You can add this in linux/drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c to see if
some commands are blocked as user:
