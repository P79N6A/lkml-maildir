Curiously, the Belkin products (
http://networking.belkin.com
) also seem
to be based upon the same source.  Looks like they could just be
rebranded firmware images with some features disabled.
Additionally, strings(1) output of firmware image may be interesting
to users of their 54g WAPs. Seems it has a lot more html pages inside
than what is documented. The 'low-end' version I bought doesn't mention
anything about firewall, dhcp, dns configuration, or parental controls,
however it's all in there if you know the right URLs. Fun.
