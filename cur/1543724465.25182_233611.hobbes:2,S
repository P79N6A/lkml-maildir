Once upon a time, everyone using any Microsoft OS used FAT, but with the 
proliferation of Windows 2000 and XP, NTFS is becoming much more 
common.  (And note that Windows folks most likely to benefit from a 
mechanism like UMSDOS are also more likely to be using NTFS rather than 
FAT.) At the same time, the need to run Linux on a system with all the disc 
space allocated for Windows is being met by Knoppix, VMware, and similar 
techniques rather than the relative kludge of actually installing Linux on 
a FAT filesystem. The days of UMSDOS are behind us.
