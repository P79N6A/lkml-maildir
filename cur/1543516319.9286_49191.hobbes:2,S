Hi.
Now request_irq() / free_irq() pair prevents unnecessary irq sharing (PNP
resource 
manager assigns not irq_request()'ed IRQ's, even if these IRQ's are really used
by another 
serial ports and free IRQ's exist).
About IRQ sharing, I'm not hardware guru and I don't now how ISA IRQ can be
shared or not shared.
If IRQ sharing is possible, then next I want to implement such algorithm:
	- first try to get free IRQ;
	- if dev->prepare() / dev->activate() failed (this most probably means that
here is no free IRQ),
	  then let PNP resource manager assign IRQ and repeat device activation with
shared IRQ.
