Sorry, I forgot. Cooking and mailing just don't mix.
Debian SID, Kernel v2.6.0-test1, compiled with GCC3.3, on a Athlon 850.
The driver is 8139too, for the RealTek8139 (no special options).
Netfilter no, IPv6 yes.
XFS, ALSA (emu10k1), OSS emulation, SCSI emulation are also in the mix.
And I did check this behaviour without running X (yet another kernel
tainted by nvidia here).
Can't rember anything else in particular..
