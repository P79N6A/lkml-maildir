The glitch1 script starts multiple scrolling xterms at the same time as 
the glxgears, and allows observation of smoothness of the gears. It's 
not a benchmark, although the fps is reported since fast or slow and 
scheduler with "fair" aspirations should have similar results in 5 sec 
time slices, and between multiple CPU-bound xterms scrolling  with the 
same code. The comments column can be used to report the user 
impressions, since that's the important thing if you want to listen to 
music or watch video.
Perhaps my data appear "wrong" because you have failed to measure the 
same thing?
You can get the most recent info at 
http://www.tmr.com/~public/source/
 
if you want to duplicate the test on your hardware, or view the most 
recent tests at 
http://www.tmr.com/~davidsen/sched_smooth_03.html
 to see 
what the data look like when you run the same test.
Note: there have been some minor changes in the test and analysis 
resulting from suggestions, only the recent results are worth investigating.
