i'm pleased to announce the v2.6.21.4-rt11 kernel, which can be 
downloaded from the usual place:
     
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/realtime-preempt/
more info about the -rt patchset can be found in the RT wiki:
     
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org
-rt11 is a bit more experimental than usual: it includes the CFS 
scheduler. Several people have suggested the inclusion of CFS into the 
-rt tree: the determinism of the CFS scheduler is a nice match to the 
determinism offered by PREEMPT_RT. The port of CFS to -rt was done by 
Dinakar Guniguntala. Tested on i686 and x86_64.
to build a 2.6.21.4-rt11 tree, the following patches should be applied:
