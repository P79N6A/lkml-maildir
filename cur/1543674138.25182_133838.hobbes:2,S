Now that the point has been raised, it seems pretty obvious that
initialisation failures should report the BUS ID of the failing card,
not the logical name assigned by the system to that device which could
change.  Once the card is up and running, using the logical name becomes
meaningful - it's the identifier which user space uses to reference the
device.
