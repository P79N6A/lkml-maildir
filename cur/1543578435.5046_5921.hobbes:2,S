Taking away get_module_symbol() and providing a replacement which has link 
order problems wasn't really very sensible.
You've changed a lookup in a static table built at compile time to a lookup 
in a dynamic table which has to be built in the right order at runtime.
It's too late to do the sensible thing and deprecate the old version rather 
than having a 'flag day'. But can we at least fix the link order crap?
struct static_inter_module_entry {
	const char *im_name;
	const void *userdata;
};
#define inter_module_register_static(x,y) \
 static struct static_inter_module_entry __ime_##x \
	__attribute__((unused,__section__(".intermodule")) \
	= { #x, y };
.. and the obvious for looking in that table in inter_module_get().
