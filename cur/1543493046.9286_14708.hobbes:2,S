Well, I bet there are at any time much more swappable (user) pages than
non-swappable pages in the <16MB area. And after all, a few pages are
enough for doing DMA transfers as the DMA controller can do no more than
128KB at a time AFAIK. (at least on Intel architectures, and that's what 
this is all about)
I can't imagine kernel pages using more than 4MB of memory
altogether (including page tables which don't neccessarily have to be in
the lower part of the memory)
