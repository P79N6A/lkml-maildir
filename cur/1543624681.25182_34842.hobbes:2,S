Actually, it's right.
In mid-February you asserted that the IDE readahead controls were
inoperative.  You said:

You didn't answer.
I tested them.  They still worked.

Then the device-driver-based readahead controls got taken out.
I really do agree that it was a pile of crap.  I've turned them
into a property of the request queue, which is a more appropriate
place for them.
In my current patch, the per-queue readahead parameter is controlled
via the old ioctls.  Probably, these will be retired in favour of
/proc/iosched, when that turns up.
In the meantime, I *need* those tunables for ongoing development.
