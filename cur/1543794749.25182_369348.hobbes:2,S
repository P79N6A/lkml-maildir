The opinion on this one started out with everyone saying "Yeah,
this is dumb, and should have changed". Now that the change appears
in a mergable patch, the opinion seems to have swung the other way.
I'm seriously rethinking this change, as no matter what we do,
we're going to make some people unhappy, so changing the status quo
seems ultimately pointless.
