But the scheduler changes to a particular application?  I still am of
opinion that the current scheduler in mainline 'breaks' priorities ...
call it dynamic tuning or whatever you like.  Now something gets
priority while something else starves.

Well, I have stayed out of this for months now, as its always 'they' at
fault - that app, or piece of code.  Sure, I am one of those whining
users, and I have no particular interest in the scheduler code - that
is if it behaves like it should.  But whatever is in now, just do not
behave as expected, and call it a feature or whatever you want, if it
deviates the definition, then what should we call it?  Or if its a
feature, can we have the weirdness in priorities disabled by default
with a sysctl or sysfs switch?

The scrolling is but one part.  Just starting an app, or running
'vim /etc/fstab' for example takes ages some times, even with
minimal load.  If xterm, gnome-term, aterm, multi-gnome-term,
etc is broken, how do we fix it then?  What about some of the
other issues?  If its a problem with those apps, why is it I still
wonder what they are doing wrong, and it not fixed?
Do not worry, _I_ will go back to lurking about this issue _again_,
but after _once_again_ seeing a issue about this being blown off
as being something wrong with 'it', and some facts (you did see
that the skipping code for the other user _never_ kicked in)
were just ignored, I just could not help myself - sorry.
At least I will not experience those issues of the others, and
hopefully Nick will not stop his work, or things change too much
to adapt his patch.
Thanks,
