TUX also has per-cpu timers patch of Ingo as well.
Did you forget this? :-)

It is equivalent to some old dumb code doing cli() right?
The only interesting global BHs left right now are:
1) Timers
2) SCSI BH
SCSI may be transformed right now in 15 minutes of boring editing to a
softirq, it has all the appropriate locking already.
Timers have no hard technical reason for not being a softirq
either.  However, this would be work requiring real thought,
not just mindless edits.
