assuming you can safely run without swap yes...
In many cases paging out processes you're not using can free up memoery 
for useful things like caching disk writes... 
for a significant number of people running without swap isn't an option. 
if you have fine grained control over how much of your memory is used by 
your apps then running without swap can be a resonable option...
