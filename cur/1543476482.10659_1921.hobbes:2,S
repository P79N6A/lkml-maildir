Well, the above driver recognizes my card no prob.  However, 4 seconds after
running ifconfig up, the hub it is attached to partitions the port.  0.90
works fine with the card. So, 89 is still buggy.
During those 4 seconds, the card works fine(I know this, because ping
responds).  It doesn't matter if there is network traffic or not.  It will
still be disabled after 4 seconds.
