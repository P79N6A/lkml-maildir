Hello all,
   I am stuck up at invalidation of a   page of a user
level process.
Wht i am doin is that i am calling a device driver
ioctl func from a normal C prog in user space and
passing a virtual address into the ioctl func .In the
ioctl func (kernel space) i want to invalidate the
corresponding page.I have used funcs like pte_clear,
flush_tlb_page,page_remove_rmap,etc. but couldnt
succeed.Also suggest if any locks have to be acquired
.
Can anyone of u help me in page invalidation.I would
be grateful.
Thanking you  in advance
