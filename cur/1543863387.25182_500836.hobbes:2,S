How about this script?
"d) Ensure that your patch does not add new trailing whitespace.  The below
   script will fix up your patch by stripping off such whitespace.
	#!/bin/sh
	strip1()
	{
		TMP=$(mktemp /tmp/XXXXXX)
		cp "$1" "$TMP"
		sed -e '/^+/s/[ 	]*$//' <"$TMP" >"$1"
		rm "$TMP"
	}
	for i in "$@"
	do
		strip1 "$i"
	done
