Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.20 still can't detect my SCSI disk

Hi Marcelo,
I had to find out why 2.4.19 did not work with one old EISA SCSI disk.
As it turned out, it's an identification problem only. I made a patch
which works for me, machine is a mail server and now
I have no problems with disks.
I sent the patch to Justin T. Gibbs, he said he will test it
and push to you.
As I see it is still not insluded in 2.4.20 (and visual inspection
of 2.4.21-pre3 patch shows it's not there either).
So I mail the patch to you and to Justin T. Gibbs.
Please include.
