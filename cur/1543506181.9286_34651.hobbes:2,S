Ack. Nasty. Any chance of killing it?
Seems what we really need to do is to emit messages in a standard format 
that syslogd can interpret and expand (even translate?), so long as it is
done properly (unlike the oops symbol expansion stuff, though I gather that
has been fixed now). I don't know how we deal with boot up messages, though.
What do other Unices do?
