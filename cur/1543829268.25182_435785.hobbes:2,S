I'm thinking to implement a way to have CPUFreq's maximum FSB increased 
to allow overclocking. Having that done, it should make sense to have a 
governor (userspace maybe, with a 3rd-party tool) thermal-throttle the 
CPU. There is one slight problem: can we control Vcore from within the 
kernel, on-the-fly, without rebooting? I've seen a comment about scaling 
voltages in cpufreq.c, but it seems there is no actual support for that.
My idea is to make cpufreq_policy.max (same for cpufreq_cpuinfo's 
member) a soft limit (to prevent unwanted overclocking from usual 
governors) and have another member hold the hard limit. Chipset drivers 
should calculate the hard limit based on installed processor or 
boot-time FSB.
I'm looking forward to comments and suggestions.
