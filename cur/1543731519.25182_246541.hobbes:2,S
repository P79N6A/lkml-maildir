That's not really true.
Name handling (dentry layer, mounting) is very much an integral part of
the filesystem. Almost everything else in the VFS is "helper functions",
ie a filesystem can choose to ignore buffer heads, page cache etc, but a 
filesystem really cannot ignore or override the VFS naming stuff.
(Arguably the page cache isn't part of the VFS layer at all, it's really a 
memory management thing, although it's so intertwined with the VFS helper 
functions that you can't really draw the line).

True, but that's not the whole truth. It's way more than just an
interface. It's a set of rules, and it's in many way the controlling
party.
