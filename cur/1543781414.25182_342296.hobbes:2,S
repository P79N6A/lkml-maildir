I have to admit I'm not qualified to do a detailed review, but I try.. ;)

The Kconfig has 'depends on X86 || X86_64' - do we know for a fact that *all*
of these boxes have CMOS at that address, including some of the odder subarchs?

That's assuming that you can figure out what happened to the box. ;)

Somehow, the concept that the kernel is trusting userspace to do the
verification before we trash the CMOS doesn't give the security geek in me
any warm-n-fuzzies, especially when we're not even checking that it's the
right vendor's gear...

That would be nice.  I have a lot less issues with letting userspace scribble
a PE1300-specific value into a PE1300 than I do with letting it scribble that
same value into whatever happens to be at the address a PE1300 would be if it
was actually there.. ;)
