As I wanted to add multithreaded probing for some s390 busses, I
discovered that the commit above removed the multithreaded probing
infrastructure again, while just some days before some of my patches
reworking it had been merged... I thought
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117591868412593&w=2
 meant that we
should go ahead with per-subsystem multithreaded probing?
(OK, PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE should not depend on BROKEN, but on
EXPERIMENTAL with the reworked probing infrastructure. This got mixed
up, I can send a patch that changes it.)
