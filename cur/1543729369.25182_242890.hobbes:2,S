Good question.  I'm (slowly) working on that.  I also have
some contributed patches that address that... patience.
I was thinking about 'make getconfig', but that would be only
one way to use it.  It would still need an external/out-of-tree
solution also.  ('make getconfig' would build binoffset and run
the extract-ikconfig script.)
