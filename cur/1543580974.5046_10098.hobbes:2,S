Subject: modversions.h source pollution in 2.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following files explicitly include linux/modversions.h.  They
should not do this, the Makefiles are responsible for automatically
including modversions.h.  Since modversions.h will disappear in 2.5,
consider this advance warning that the offending sources can expect
problems.
Maintainers: please fix these sources by removing modversions.h.

The presence of symbols like foo__ver_foo is not a reason to explicitly
include modversions.h, see
