I used your patch on 2.4.10-pre10-xfs from the SGI cvs tree.
2 files had to be changed
fs/xfs_support/atomic.h and fs/xfs_support/mutex.h
needed a include sched.h
rootfilesystem is ext2 everything else is xfs
athlon optimisation is switched on
chipset is via
the nvidia kernel module for OpenGL acceleration is running
hisax isdn driver for internet access
USB web cam
I have tried heavy filesystem operations (cp -ar x y && rm -rf y)
with a big compile job -j2 and some OpenGL programs together with the 
web cam
on the USB side i had some "_comp parameters have gone AWOL" messages in 
the syslog from the cpia driver
but i remember them from a no preemtion kernel as well
so far everything is stable
i like the idea but i have not made any tests on the latency yet
Regards
Gerold
