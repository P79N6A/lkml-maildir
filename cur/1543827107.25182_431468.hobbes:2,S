Makes sense...

Let's call ext3 "Linux 2.4" for a second and ext(x) w/extents and 48-bit 
"Linux 2.5". We can now do all the crazy, wild work we want on 2.5, but 
people need it tomorrow. And they can have it, but we're stamping 
"Dangerous! Dangerous! Unstable! API changes every 5 minutes, your data 
will be obsoleted each release!" all over it. This goes on for years until 
we finally reach a point where we can roll out "Linux 2.6".
The trouble is that "Linux 2.6" is something many of us are going to be 
wanting _now_.
Now, taking the quotes back off "Linux 2.6" and speaking about the kernel 
as a whole again - isn't lots of incremental stable releases with new 
functionality something that cutting off the development arm made 
possible?
I acknowledge the concerns about filesystem stability and Linus's points 
about improperly shared code. From a practical standpoint, I see the need 
of bigger filesystems coming.
And the biggest practical problem I see is one of perception. Making 
'ext4' means labelling it unstable for a while. And once something like a 
_filesystem_ is called unstable, it's going to be a long time before 
people trust it with terabytes of their incredibly valuable data (even if 
we promise them that it's mostly an ext3 fork).
Whereas if you play with some experimental 48-bit extension on ext3, well, 
ext3 already has a good reputation and is in use everywhere, so maybe this 
isn't a bad "last feature" to add before forking off into ext4-land?
