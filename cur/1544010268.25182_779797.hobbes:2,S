Hello everybody!
My notebook is using acpi_cpufreq and cpufreq_stats, with 2.6.27.6, but the 
same happened for 2.6.26 (and IIRC 2.6.25 and earlier).
I have a script that uses the /sys/ files to show some information.
If I "rmmod acpi_cpufreq" and "modprobe acpi_cpufreq", followed by "rmmod 
cpufreq_stats" (because there's no directory "stats" below /sys/.../cpufreq), 
I get this warning.
The calltrace shows
	...
	? mutex_unlock
	cpufreq_stats_free_table+0x54
	cpufreq_stats_exit+0x45
	sys_delete_module
	...
Regards,
Phil
