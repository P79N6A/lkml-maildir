No, if it's a multiply linked file, you want all unlinks except the last
to operate the way they always have, and only the LAST link moves to the
trashcan.
Otherwise, if you have a file with two links, and one moves to the trashcan,
it's then subject to reaping and overwriting - which will come as a great
surprise to the still-existing link....
