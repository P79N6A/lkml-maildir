Ok, that explains the lockstat: I've missed data on rcu_group_state.lock.
I'd just use 32. The code uses a two-level bitmap and the group size 
specifies the size of the lower level.
Thus you use right now a 2/256 split. Therefore you still trash the 
spinlock that protects the upper level. Group size 32 would generate a 
32/16 split.
