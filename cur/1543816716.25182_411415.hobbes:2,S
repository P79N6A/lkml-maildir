When upgrading from 2.6.15 to 2.6.16 I noticed iptables not working anymore.
I traced the problem down to a new 'CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES' compile option
that must be set, but I still get some rules rejected as soon as
'--destination-port' option is used.
As an example, the following command:
  iptables -A eth0in -p udp --destination-port 111 -j DROP
used to work with 2.6.15
but fails with 2.6.16 with the following error message:
  iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
