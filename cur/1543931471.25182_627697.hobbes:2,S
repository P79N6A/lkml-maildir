No.

Each file descriptor opened creates one separate cache instance.  Any commands
sent over that filedescriptor affect only the cache instance it is attached
to; similarly, any status data you read only refers to that one cache
instance.
Closing the file descriptor makes the cache go away as far as the kernel is
concerned.  The cachefiles daemon retains its cache dev file descriptor for
the lifetime of the daemon.

As far as the cache daemon is concerned, the file descriptor is its handle to
the cache so the conflict does not arise.

So the following (taken from cachefilesd.te):
	allow cachefilesd_t cachefiles_var_t : file { getattr rename unlink };
says, for example, allow:
	avc_has_perm("cachefilesd_t",
		     "cachefiles_var_t",
		     SECCLASS_FILE,
		     FILE__RENAME,
		     ...);
