Well, I need the help of The Wise. :-)
If I comment out only the modification of jiffies in timer_resume() in 
arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c (ie line 986), everything seems to work, but I get 
"APIC error on CPU0: 00(00)" after device_power_up(), which seems strange to 
me, because I boot with "noapic".  On the other hand, if it's not commented 
out (ie jiffies _is_ modified in timer_resume()), the machine hangs solid 
after executing device_power_up() in swsusp_suspend().
Right now I have no idea of what happens there, and it seems strange because 
in 2.6.10-mm1 the code in time.c is the same.
Greets,
