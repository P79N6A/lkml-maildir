i can consistently produce this on dual p3 600/2.2.17pre20.  in my case
it's the `ab' benchmark tool supplied with apache that helps reproduce
it.  incidentally i only noticed this in the last day or two, good to
know i'm not the only one. :-)
our setup is apache/php/postgresql.  fairly intensive pages.  i start
seeing vmstat oddities after about 15 concurrent requests.

the vmstat processes probably aren't reading /proc/* at exactly the same
time, so the numbers they see will likely be different...
