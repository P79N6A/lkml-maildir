It was claimed that GPLv3 would forbid implementations of DRM.  That's
just plain false.  If you don't think so, please show what terms in
the latest draft prohibit DRM (as opposed to merely making it
ineffective, a necessary consequence of abiding by the spirit of all
GNU GPLs)

Another misunderstanding.  The FSF never said TiVo didn't do anything
wrong.  It only said it didn't think there was a license violation.  I
personally disagree with that assessment, but IANAL.
Anyhow, deciding whether it's right or wrong is not the same as
deciding whether it's legal or illegal.  Law doesn't define what's
right or wrong.  That's what morals and ethics do.

When they choose to include a copy of the kernel in their hardware
that they can modify but others can't, they're failing to comply with
the spirit of the license.  For brevity, I won't repeat the quotes
from the GPLv2 preamble, that I just included in the message I sent to
Lennart Sorensen in this same thread.  Can you justify how you came to
the conclusion (if you did) that TiVo is abiding by the spirit of the
license?

Wow, I didn't see that coming.  Public admission of ill intentions?
;-) :-D :-P

Let me see if I got this right.  There was a section entitled
"3. Digital Restrictions Management" in GPLv3dd1.  Are you saying
that, when people complained about the DRM clause, they actually meant
the provisions in "1. Source Code", that established a requirement to
include the source code corresponding to functional signatures, namely
the signing keys, as part of the corresponding source code?
> And you're just parrotting their idiotic line.
Please watch your tone.  If you find offense at the allegedly
condescending tone in which the FSF says "misunderstanding", how do
you expect me and the FSF to take this?
It is also odd that you claim the right to be entitled to your own
opinion and reading about stuff, while denying myself the same right.
Please don't do that.  I have a mind of my own, and the fact that I
reach similar conclusions doesn't make me a parrot.  Even more so when
I actually have some influence on those conclusions.

You are definitely confused.  You're talking about the legal terms,
while I'm talking about the spirit.  The legal terms tried to reflect
the spirit as best as they could, but they left some holes.  Some
people found them and started exploiting them.
Sure, if you want to leave those holes unplugged in your code, that's
your decision.  I don't doubt that the GPLv2 legal terms fit the bill
for you.  I think GPLv3 would do even better in this regard.  But none
of this is about the spirit of the GPL.  Claiming GPLv3 changes the
spirit is totally missing the point of what the spirit amounts to.
The spirit is described in the preamble, it's not the legal terms.

Ok, let's explore this argument.  In what sense is it tit-for-tat?
What is tit-for-tat about it?  What is the payback an author who
releases software under the GPL can legitimately expect to get?

The freedoms I'm talking about are very clearly described in the
spirit (preamble) of the license you chose for your project.  Go look
at the preamble one more time, "grand poobah" ;-)
  [...] the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
  freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software
  is free for all its users [...]
  [...] Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
  get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
  pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
  these things.
