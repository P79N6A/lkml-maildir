This never saved anyone any pain. 2.4.x was not the stable kernel
you're painting it to be until 2.4.20 or later, and by the time it
became so the fixes for major regressions that occurred during 2.3.x
were deemphasized and ignored for anything prior to 2.6.x.

My experience tells me that the number of regressions in 2.6.x compared
to purportedly ``far stabler'' kernels is about the same or (gasp!)
less. So the observable advantage of the ``frozen'' or ``stable'' model
is less than or equal to zero.
Frankly, kernel hacking is a difficult enough task (not that I
personally find it so) that frivolous patches are not overwhemingly
numerous. The ``barrier'' you're erecting is primarily acting as a
barrier to fixes, not bugs.

Again, the loss of critical examination far outweighs the purported
defense against regressions. The most typical result of playing the fix
backporting game for extended periods of time is numerous rounds of
months-long bughunts for bugs whose fixes were merged years ago upstream.
When the bugs are at long last found, they are discovered to fix the
problems of hundreds of users until the next such problem surfaces.
