Hi Len,
Here's a set of patches for changing the removable drive bay driver
(drivers/acpi/bay) from using the old proc interface to using a sysfs
interface instead.  I made the bay driver a platform driver, and 
so it's entries will now be located in /sys/devices/platform/bay.X.
There are still 2 entries - one for checking whether the bay is
present (present) that is read only, and one that is write only for
ejecting the bay (eject).  Let me know if you would prefer me to fold
these into the original bay driver patch.
Thanks,
Kristen
