Shutdown methods will typically call into the slab allocator and the page
allocator to free stuff, and they are pretty common sources of oopses. 
Often with locks held.  You run an excellent change of deadlocking.
Possibly one could add
#ifdef CONFIG_WHATEVER
	if (unlikely(oops_in_progress))
		return;
#endif
to the relevant entry points.
The shutdown routines may also call into sysfs/kobject/procfs release entry
points, and they're even more popular oops sites.
We really want to get into the new kernel ASAP and clean stuff up from
in there.
