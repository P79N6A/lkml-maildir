The 2.6.10-1.737_FC3 + 's/posix_lock_file/posix_lock_file_wait/' on
fs/nfs/file.c seems stable on our mailserver running XFS on
mail queue and spool (mbox). 4 days of uptime!

My XFS-fileserver ran 2.6.9-rc3 stable since october 25. Got lots of
"possible deadlock in kmem_alloc (mode:0xd0)" this weekend, so I
upgraded to plain 2.6.10. Seems OK so far.
