Well, that's the BSD man page.
I've always considered "swapped" to mean "paged"
when dealing with Linux. We still have our swap
partitions and swapon command, not paging partitions
and pageon command.
I suppose "paged out the area with the stack pointer"
would be a good approximation to the BSD behavior.

If the variables counted paging, I consider them
correct for Linux.
