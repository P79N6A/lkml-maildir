After installing 2.2.0-pre4 I have noticed that netscape starts
locking up after about 5 minutes (presumably while trying to poll my
POP server).
An strace reveals a stream of:
write(40, "QUIT\r\n", 6)                = -1 EAGAIN (Resource 
temporarily unavailable)
write(40, "QUIT\r\n", 6)                = -1 EAGAIN (Resource 
temporarily unavailable)
