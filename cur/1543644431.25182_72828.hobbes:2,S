your measurements are really useful i think, and people like Andrew
started to watch those numbers - this is why at this point a bit more
effort can/should be taken to filter out fluctuations better. Ie. a single
fluctuation could send Andrew out on a wild goose chase while perhaps in
reality his kernel was the fastest. Running every test twice should at
least give a ballpart figure wrt. fluctuations, without increasing the
runtime unrealistically.
i agree that only the IO benchmarks are problematic from this POV - things
like the process load and your other CPU-saturating numbers look perfectly
valid.
obviously another concern to to make testing not take days to accomplish.  
This i think is one of the hardest things - making timely measurements
which are still meaningful and provide stable results.
