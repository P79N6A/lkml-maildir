It depends what BIOS firmware you have

Most Cyrix MediaGX / NatSemi Geode stuff seems to work. Its all a bit
complicated because most of the hardware is a BIOS manufactured illusion
using SMM mode. On the CS5530/5530x at least we support VSA1 video, audio
(including the needed bug workarounds) etc. Not afaik the watchdog. 
Watchdog drivers are easy to right fortunately.
If you have VSA2 based firmware then I've no idea what you'll get
