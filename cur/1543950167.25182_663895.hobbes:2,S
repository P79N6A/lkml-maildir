Start: You discovered at some point where you currently have code a variable 
is not updated yet.
Fact: You have some new code that runs before that point
Information: The variable is updated later eventually in the idle exit path.
Fact II: You require the variable to be updated in your new code
Possible solutions: 
(1) you move your new code in a point of the idle exit path after the variable 
is updated 
(2) you move the code that updates the variable earlier before your code
Solution: I described the first variant which is likely easier.
How: I told you where it is updated, so that shouldn't be too difficult. 
Action: Implement solution (1) or (2) 
Action: Test if it works
Check: If test succeeded exit 
Otherwise: Restart at Start
