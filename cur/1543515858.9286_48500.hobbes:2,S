    This is not correct.  GPL software may be integrated with a great deal
    of non-GPL software.  Aside from interpretation of "integrated", which
    clearly does vary according to who is interpreting it*, there are many
    licenses which are non-GPL but GPL-compatible.
Correct.  For example, the X11 license is compatible with the GPL.
So is the new updated Berkeley license.
Your message refers to a license for reiserfs.  I am not sure what
that license says, so I cannot comment about it.
