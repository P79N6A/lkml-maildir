For the type of deadlock you are talking about is the following:
P1 -- grabs futex A (no system call)
P2 -- grabs futex B (no system call)
P1 -- tries to grab futex B (system call to block and boost P2)
      But holds no other kernel rt_mutex!
P2 -- tries to grab futex A (system call to block and boost P1)
     spinning deadlock here,
So, before P2 blocks on P1, can there be a circular check t see if this is
a deadlock.  You don't need to worry about other kernel rt_mutexes, you
only need to worry about blocked process.
Is this feasible?
