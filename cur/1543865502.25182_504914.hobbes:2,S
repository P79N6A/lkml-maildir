IIRC, the do_linuxrc thread cannot be frozen (doesn't call try_to_freeze()),
so the freeze_processes() during the resume fails and the resume fails as a
result.
Still, I have an idea:
Instead of hunting for PF_NOFREEZE and wondering if the suspend/resume fails
when we remove them or replace them with try_to_freeze(), why don't we add
an "ignore_pf_nofreeze" argument to freeze_processes() and make it regard
_all_ tasks as if they haven't set PF_NOFREEZE when this "ignore_pf_nofreeze"
is set?  Of course, additionally we'll have to make everyone call
try_to_freeze(), even if they set PF_NOFREEZE anyway.
Then, if freeze_processes() is called with "ignore_pf_nofreeze = 0", it will
work just as it does now.  However, if it's called with
"ignore_pf_nofreeze = 1", it will try to make all prcesses enter the
refrigerator.  The "ignore_pf_nofreeze = 0" version will be suitable for us
(ie. suspend etc.) and the "ignore_pf_nofreeze = 1" version will be suitable
for the CPU hotplug and such things.
You think?
