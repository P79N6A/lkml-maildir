It's not trivial at all. You need to introduce a mechanism for noting a 
KEY_UNKNOWN keypress. It then needs to signal the user (dbus is probably 
the best layer for this), but you need to ensure that you only signal 
the user who is currently at the keyboard. This needs to be presented to 
the user via some sort of UI, which will then need to signal some sort 
of privileged process to actually change the keymap. When the user logs 
out, you'll then need to unmap the key again and repeat as necessary for 
any new user who logs in.
Alternatively, we could generate a keycode and then let the user map 
that to an X keysym. We've even already got code to do this.

That's a ridiculously niche case, and can be handled in userspace. Just 
have udev do remapping when it detects multiple keyboards that both have 
KEY_PROG* layers, or let X have different keymaps for different input 
devices. We shouldn't make the (by far) common case significantly more 
difficult to deal with this one.
