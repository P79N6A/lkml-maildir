Hi,
My Iomega Jaz USB drive has stopped working.  I'm not sure when, I know it
has worked since 2.4.0 but I haven't used it for a couple of weeks.
The problem is:
Feb 23 15:13:47 evansj kernel: hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/2,
assigned device number 5
Feb 23 15:13:47 evansj kernel: usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=5
(error=-32)
Feb 23 15:13:48 evansj kernel: hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/2,
assigned device number 6
Feb 23 15:13:48 evansj kernel: usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=6
(error=-32)
These mesages appear whenever the device is plugged in.
My USB mouse, in the other USB port, continues to work fine.
Jon.
