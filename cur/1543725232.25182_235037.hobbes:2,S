The problem is the program does not know its stdin corresponds to a
process' address space and it does not know it is making use of a
privilege to read it.  A correctly written SUID root program may
reasonably assume that the data it obtains from stdin is whatever the
unprivileged user has provided, -- and, for example, display such data
back to the user (as a part of an error message or so).  If we permit
reads from /proc/<pid>/mem based on credentials of the read(2)-calling
process only, this assumption would be violated resulting in security
holes.
Oh, by the way, I've just noticed that the above example is not
entirely correct.  In order to read setuidapp's own address space
(after the kernel has been patched according to your proposal), it
should have been:
$ exec setuidapp < /proc/self/mem
