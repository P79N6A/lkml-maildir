Except that I'm _always_ going to have to be able to take these events
as input events (because of the hardware that sends them that way), so
why not just have everything be an input event?
The alternative is building up something new from the ground-up and then
having to do translation from input to the new event type (either in the
kernel or in userspace) which ends up meaning more work for little, if
any, gain
