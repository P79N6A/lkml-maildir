"The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6", IEEE Std 1003.1-2001:
 The readv() function may fail if:
 [EINVAL]
 The iovcnt argument was less than or equal to 0, or greater than {IOV_MAX}.
Notice the "may"? From the same document:
 may
 Describes a feature or behavior that is optional for an implementation
 that conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. An application should not rely on
 the existence of the feature or behavior. An application that relies on
 such a feature or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across
 conforming implementations.
 To avoid ambiguity, the opposite of may is expressed as need not,
 instead of may not.
    
So the 0 there just mean nothing, exactly what you get.
