Heh.. I'm just a very unsophisticated desktop user, and I like it when
Thunderbird and Firefox are unaffected by the "make -j3" kernel builds
that are often running in another window.  BIG difference there.
And on the cool side, the Swarm game (swarm.swf) is a great example of
something that used to get jerky really fast whenever anything else was
running, and now it really doesn't seem to be affected by anything.
(I don't really play computer games, but this one is has a very retro feel..).
