No, it is a true transactional journal with ACID semantics.  It just
doesn't necessarily include data.

That is the standard definition of the term in the fs community on
Unix.  Sounds like you are the one trying to redefine it!

No.  You may be thinking of a log-structured filesystem, but that is
_completely_ different from metadata journaling (which of course
doesn't mean that marketing depts don't sometimes try to confuse
them).  An LFS is necessarily journaled, but not all journaled
filesystems are log structured.
