The look like the inb/inw/outb/outw functions. Im not sure how DOS asm
maps byte and word sized in and out
swmem is a byte swap. There isnt a trivial equivalent because its almost
never the case you want to byteswap but you want to convert endiannesses
htons() will probably do the right thing while you figure it out
