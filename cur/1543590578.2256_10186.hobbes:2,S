Using DHCP, on Slackware 7.1 w/ GLIBC 2.2, kernel 2.4.4(and 2.4.5pre1 w/
8139too.patch to v0.9.17)
---
media is unconnected, link down, or incompatible connection
---
Is the exact message I get, though, with the v0.9.15c version of the
driver, my NIC works perfectly fine, should I revert to using kernel
2.4.3 w/ v0.9.15c of the 8139too driver until it is fixed?
If there is anymore information needed to help in possibly fixing the
problem I'd be more than glad to oblige.
