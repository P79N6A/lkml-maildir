Hi,
I am having some problems with my EEPro 100 card.
Seems like my dual speed hub doesnt like it when some
of the cards are 10 MB and some others are 100 ....
How can I force the card to use 10 MB instead of 100MB
or auto detect ? I am using the driver included in
kernel 2.4.9, and I couldnt find any infos on how to
do this ... 
Thanks in advance
Marco Schwarz
