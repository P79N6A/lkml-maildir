My initial patch provides both (cpu-based and mask-based). I will remove
one method if feedback seconds this assumption.

I don't think so.

An enhanced API doesn't need to expose how per-cpu data is actually
organised, i.e. struct percpu_data. That is, archs are still free to
implement per-cpu data in different ways.
The patch allows to make the dynamic allocation, or removal,
respectively, of per-cpu data a two-stage process:
a1) initial (partial) allocation
a2) further population as needed (i.e. when CPU is coming online)
b1) (partial) depopulation as needed (i.e. when CPU is going offline)
b2) final removal
If some arch-optimisation hindered changing objects at run time, well,
a2) and b1 would be just NOPs, leaving all the work to a1) and b2). The
performance of per_cpu_ptr() won't be affected, anyway.
Does this address your qualms?

1k for a single (sample) object doesn't sound that much.
But how big will (statistic) ojects really be? I can't tell.
And how many objects will be there? I don't know.
'grep -r CPU_UP_PREPARE' indicates that there are people who are worried
about memory consumption of (unused) per-cpu data.
