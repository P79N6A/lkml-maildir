Hi, I have been experiencing a very strange problem with 2.2.6 (and also
previous kernels).  I have posted several times to a few Linux newsgroups,
but no help there.  Perhaps someone of you have encountered something like
this before:
Sometimes (my guess is when there are a lot of connect() calls
simultaneously.. 30-40 perhaps) connections die very strangely _after_
that: you can't establish any TCP connection anymore.  Only rebooting
works.  ICMP works fine; I think UDP also works (or else I have a
really big dns cache).
Might this be a kind of anti-DOS or something?
I have two NIC's, one for the private lan (eth1; 192.168.1.2) and one
for the net (eth0; 130.233.25.176).  For some reason, all connections
from the server _seem_ to use 192.168.1.2 address.. Wouldn't it be
much wiser to use eth0's IP address?  Is there a way to change that?
Also, I'm using Ipchains 1.3.8, and I think this might be (partly) a
masquerading/forwarding problem.  
As it happens, every connection from my masqueraded Win98 box works
fine despite the server having difficulties: only exceptions are those
that use identd (which is run on the server) or similar applications..
But this only slows it down a bit (since apps don't even response
from identd), doesn't disable connections entirely.
So, the only thing affected seems to be connections from the server
which _seem_ use the local lan address to connect to remote sites.
If I take the local lan interface down with ifconfig after the crash,
it still doesn't work.  
Does anyone have _any_ idea where to look for the problem or to fix
it?  This is getting very frustrating.
Here are some, hopefully relevant, parts of 'strace ftp ftp.funet.fi':
[192.168.1.2 int nic, 130.233.25.176 ext nic, 128.214.248.6 
ftp.funet.fi]
Notes:  the non-working version freezes at connect() to ftp.funet.fi 
Otherwise there doesn't seem to be much difference. 
I don't know current tcp/ip implementation very well, but it feels 
a bit odd with common sense if my actual outbound IP is mentioned only
after establishing connection; it always tries 192.168.1.2 first 
(I guess it's cached or something since even if I took the interface
down, it still uses 192.168.1.2).
non-working connection:
-------
close(3)                                = 0
munmap(0x4000b000, 10652)               = 0
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET,
sin_port=htons(53),sin_addr=inet_addr("192.168.1.2")}, 16) = 0
send(3, "t\310\1\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\3ftp\5"..., 30, 0) = 30
select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, {5, 0})      = 1 (in [3], left {5, 0})
recvfrom(3, "t\310\201\200\0\1\0\1\0\2\0\2\3f"..., 1024,
0,{sin_family=AF_INET,
sin_port=htons(53),sin_addr=inet_addr("192.168.1.2")}, [16]) = 130
close(3)                                = 0
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET,
sin_port=htons(21),sin_addr=inet_addr("128.214.248.6")}, 16

And the working one:
-------
close(3)                                = 0
munmap(0x4000b000, 10652)               = 0
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET,
sin_port=htons(53),sin_addr=inet_addr("192.168.1.2")}, 16) = 0
send(3, "g\337\1\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\3ftp\5"..., 30, 0) = 30
select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, {5, 0})      = 1 (in [3], left {5, 0})
recvfrom(3, "g\337\201\200\0\1\0\1\0\2\0\2\3f"..., 1024,
0,{sin_family=AF_INET,
sin_port=htons(53),sin_addr=inet_addr("192.168.1.2")}, [16]) = 130
close(3)                                = 0
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET,
sin_port=htons(21),sin_addr=inet_addr("128.214.248.6")}, 16) = 0
<----- the non-working version froze here ------->
getsockname(3, {sin_family=AF_INET,
sin_port=htons(1028),sin_addr=inet_addr("130.233.25.176")}, [16]) = 0
setsockopt(3, IPPROTO_IP, 1, [16], 4)   = 0
