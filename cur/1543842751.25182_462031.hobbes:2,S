I would personally _much_ rather have a separate mmiowb() and a regular 
spinlock, than add a magic new spinlock.
Of course, mmiowb() itself is not a great name, and we could/should 
probably rename it to make it more obvious what the hell it is.

I think this is even more important when the actual IO is done somewhere 
totally different from the locking. It's really confusing if you have a 
"spin_unlock_io()" just because some routine you called wanted it.
But more importantly, I don't want to have "spin_unlock_io[_xyzzy]()", 
where "xyzzy()" is all the irq/irqrestore/bh variations. It's just not 
worth it. We already have enough variations on spinlocks, but at least 
right now they are all in the "same category", ie it's all about what the 
context of the _locking_ is, and at least the lock matches the unlock, and 
there are no separate rules.
