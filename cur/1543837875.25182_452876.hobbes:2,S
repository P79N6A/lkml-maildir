Hi Linas.
Just noticed a nit-pick detail.
The general rule is to add your Signed-off-by: at the bottom of the
patch, so the top-most Signed-of-by: is also the original author whereas
the last Signed-of-by: is the one that added this patch to the kernel.
Likewise you add Cc: before your Signed-off-by: line.
See patches from for example Andrew Morton for examples.
