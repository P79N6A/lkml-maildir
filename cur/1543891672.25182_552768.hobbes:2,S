Different behaviour would be fine.  This function will be used to pick
good candidates for garbage collection.  If one segment will get chosen
over another depending on BITS_PER_LONG, either one would have been a
good candidate anyway.
Hmm.  Maybe I should s/32/BITS_PER_LONG/ in the function.

That would make sense, yes.
