I think one of the immediate things usable to drivers is to check the
netif_rx() return value and yield the CPU if the system is congested.
This is hardware independent. For the Tulip, since it knows how to do
mitigation, it infact reduces it's interupt rate. An even simpler thing is
to use HW_FLOW_CONTROL where you shutdown rx_interupt based on system
congestion (and get worken up later when things get better).
For 2.5 the plan is to work around any hardware dependencies.
