Subject: Parport PCI card doesn't share IRQ

Hi parport hackers,
I have a
Communication controller: PCI device 9710:9815 (rev 1).
here, and it runs fine as long as you don't try to share its IRQ. Maybe
related: "cat /proc/interrupts" does not show the card is on IRQ 11 --- so
when I put my NE2000 clone network card _also_ on IRQ 11, the system hangs
as soon as the card is used, i.e. ifconfig'ed.
Is there something I (or you) can do about it?
Regards+greetings,
Enver
PS: I have to share the IRQ between USB and NE2000 now, this works fine.
However, I sometimes use Win98 to burn CDs. It doesn't start with this
setup so I have to BIOS-SETUP the Comm.Card to share IRQ with the NE2000
for this other OS.... brrrr!
