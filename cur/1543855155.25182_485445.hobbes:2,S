Subject: RFC: Removal of pci_dma_* functions

A grep for
  pci_dac_dma_supported()
  pci_dac_page_to_dma()
  pci_dac_dma_to_page()
  pci_dac_dma_to_offset()
  pci_dac_dma_sync_single_for_cpu()
  pci_dac_dma_sync_single_for_device()
reveals that only a some platforms implement these functions and there seems
to be no single user.  Any objections against removing?  Or why did we ever
add them anyay ...
