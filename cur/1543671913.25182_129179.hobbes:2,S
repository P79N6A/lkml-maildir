One to do something like this is to use signals.  You could use ioctl for 
userspace to register with the driver, and to query the status.  When the 
correct combination of inputs occurs, you thwap the process with a SIGUSR1, 
which tells it to wake up and query the input line status.
Alternately, you could use ioctl for configuration and wait on a socket for 
notification as to when to query the status.
Finally, you could use ioctl for configuration and write a byte to the socket 
when the right event happens, the byte being a bitmap of the 8 input lines.
