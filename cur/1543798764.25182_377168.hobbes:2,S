Which is what local_t does for BITS_PER_LONG==32 arches:
#define LOCAL_INIT(i)   { ATOMIC_INIT(i) }
#define local_read(l)   ((unsigned long)atomic_read(&(l)->a))
#define local_set(l,i)  atomic_set((&(l)->a),(i))
#define local_inc(l)    atomic_inc(&(l)->a)
#define local_dec(l)    atomic_dec(&(l)->a)
#define local_add(i,l)  atomic_add((i),(&(l)->a))
#define local_sub(i,l)  atomic_sub((i),(&(l)->a))
/* Non-atomic variants, ie. preemption disabled and won't be touched
 * in interrupt, etc.  Some archs can optimize this case well. */
#define __local_inc(l)          local_set((l), local_read(l) + 1)
#define __local_dec(l)          local_set((l), local_read(l) - 1)
#define __local_add(i,l)        local_set((l), local_read(l) + (i))
#define __local_sub(i,l)        local_set((l), local_read(l) - (i))
