Not really, no. What it preferred is a low number of transfers. Hence we try to shuffle as much data as possible using blocks first.

I agree that mmc_io_rw_extended() is broken, but I do not think sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() is. I'll be doing a fix eventually, but it probably won't get that high on my todo list as it will only be useful together with some new API. Since your card was content with byte transfers, it shouldn't be that much need for a rush.
