It looks good.  I think I was having a bad day when I introduced those thinkos.
I'm a bit distracted at the moment so I don't trust myself to forward
the patch on.  Hopefully later today.

Yep, that is a bug.  I hadn't realized real systems that exhausted the
number of vectors were quite so close.  That totally explains your
interest.  That is one I/O heavy development system you have YH.
Unless there is a reason not to, TARGET_CPUS should be cpu_online map.
I don't know why it is restricted to a single cpu.  I'm curious how
that would affect the user space irq balancer.

That sounds like a very reasonable approach.

Yes.  Numa affinity for the ioapics seems to make sense.  I don't
think we can count on looking at the address though?  Are your
ioapics pci devices?  If so that would be the easiest way to
deal with this problem.

So far that is the job of the user space irqbalancer, but I don't see
why the kernel can't setup some reasonable defaults, if we have all of
the information needed.
For 2.6.19 we should be able to get my typos fixed, and probably
the default mask increased so that we are given a choice of something
other than cpu 0.
Beyond that it is going to take some additional working and thinking
and so it probably makes sense to have the code sit in the -mm
or Andi's tree for a while, and let it mature for 2.6.20.
