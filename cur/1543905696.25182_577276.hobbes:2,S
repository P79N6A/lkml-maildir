Hello, all.
This patchset contains a locking fix and cleanup patches for sysfs.
#01	locking fix
#02	shadow support removal from Eric adapted to apply after #01
#03-07	clean up patches
#01 should go mainline as it fixes a locking regression introduced by
-rc1 merge.  The rest should stay in -gregkh till 24 merge window
opens up.
Clean up patches don't introduce any noticeable behavior change.  They
just refactor and simplify codes.
Thanks.
