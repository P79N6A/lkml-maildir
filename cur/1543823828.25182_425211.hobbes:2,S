I think it adequately demonstrates that you're unable to distinguish
between problems that *a specific implementation of X* has, and problems
that *the X system as a design* has.  If one particular X server has
a misfeature, the correct fix is to fix the server software.
And in particular, it's *not* even an X problem, as you'd know if you bothered
actually *reading* what you quoted:
"It is hard to see how they could have done other -- that is how much evil the
cards contain."
So if you want to fix the *problem*, go learn enough about graphics to
actually help design an open, non-evil chipset.  That's the *real* problem,
not whatever fantasized shortcomings of X itself you're trolling about.
