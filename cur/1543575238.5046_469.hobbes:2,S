One alternative would presumably be to reserve a block in the 0-1M
region for a routine to be called on resume that makes sure everything
is set up correctly.  However, from the various comments, I gather that
such is not viable as it's already been excluded for other reasons, but
nobody seems to say precicely what the problems with this idea are?
I would presume such a routine would be set up such that when it's time
to suspend, a call is made to that routine at its 0-1M address, so when
the resume kicks in, it sees an IP in the 0-1M region to resume to.
As part of the kernel start-up, the kernel would reserve the page in
question, then copy the suspend/resume code to it, and only then would
it enable the suspend/resume facility.
Best wishes from Riley.
