Don't expect specs or opensource drivers for any of these pieces
of hardware until these vendors figure out a way to hide the frequency
programming interface.
Ie. these cards can be programmed to transmit at any frequency,
and various government agencies don't like it when f.e. users can
transmit on military frequencies and stuff like that.
The only halfway plausible idea I've seen is to not document the
frequency programming registers, and users get a "region" key file that
has opaque register values to program into the appropriate registers.
The file is per-region (one for US, Germany, etc.)and the wireless
kernel driver reads in this file to do the frequency programming.
So don't blame the vendors on this one, several of them would love
to publish drivers public for their cards, but simply cannot with
upsetting federal regulators.
