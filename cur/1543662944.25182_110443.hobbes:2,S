So the semantics of the shutdown method is: "You are being called at 
reboot or halt time, no other processes are running or will ever run, 
quiesce the device, but do nothing else".  Then obviously, it's exactly 
what we need, if you can get the device driver writers to implement it.
It would be very nice to have documentation on this (and the rest of the 
driver model, too).  The docs in the kernel don't give a big picture.  
In fact, just reading the docs give you no idea what a driver model is.  
Does some other source of documentation exist?
device_shutdown() claims a semaphore for some reason, though.  I suspect 
it's not necessary.
