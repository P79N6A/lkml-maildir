You've just described the reasons why Algol 68 is a Bad Thing(tm).  Everyone
has his own subset and almost nobody understands what exactly happens in
others' code.

We can't get people to follow common style and you expect adherence to
some subset of the language smaller than "compiler doesn't spit errors
on that"?  Dream on.
And then there is "six month ago I cud not spel injuneer and now I r won"
crowd - and quite a few of them seem to be afraid of C.  FWIC it is a
damn good reason to stay with C...
