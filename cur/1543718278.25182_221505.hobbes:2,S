A good example that this is true is section 7.9.2 of your 
"specification".
It lists under "Work in Progress":
  Kernel SHALL be configuralble with compiler size options, such as -Os.
Besides the text in the "Rationale" being obviously wrong, this is 
already implemented in kernel 2.6. But the people writing this
"specification" didn't send a patch - the trivial patch was sent by 
someone who is in no way related to your "Forum".
