I regret getting into this discussion late, but it should always be (A)
if you're building a kernel for strict RT usage. (B) is for a system that's
more general purpose. It's not a "one policy fits all" kind of problem.
The search costs of (A) could be be significant and may degrade system
performance. Optimizations for that case is for another discussion.
