Well I'd like to see a comprehensive solution including a fix for the 
problems with allocper_cpu() allocations (allocper_cpu has to allocate 
memory for potential processors... which could be a lot on 
some types of systems and its allocated somewhere not on the nodes of the 
processor since they may not yet be online).
Wish I could be back home in Germany to talk a walk with you. Are you 
coming to the OLS?
