Don't do that.  The kernel may need you to use a different interrupt
number than you read from the PCI config header.  Use dev->irq, as in
	request_irq(dev->irq, sseintr, SA_SHIRQ | SA_INTERRUPT, "sse", softp);
Also, make sure that you do pci_enable_device(dev) before you look at
dev->irq, since the field will not be initialized until you do that.
