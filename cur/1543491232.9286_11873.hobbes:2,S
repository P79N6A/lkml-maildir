Use 'make bzlilo' to get the same effect as 'make zlilo' but with a kernel
that can be bigger than 640kb. The reason is probably well known, the '640kb
should be enough for everyone' reason, and the bzImage kernel image (which
is used by 'make bzlilo') uses a different bootstrapping technique, making
it possible to have a bigger kernel.
