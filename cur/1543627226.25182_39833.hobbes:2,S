You don't need to duplicate the code:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.19pre3aa2/00_rb-export-1
It is just included in 2.4.19pre6 mainline btw, so just updating to the
latest kernel should solve your problem with the module.
2.5 is still missing it, but it should be applied there too eventually.
