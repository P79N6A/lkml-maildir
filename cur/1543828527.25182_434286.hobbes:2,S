Further testing shows it doesn't.
When using pci=assign-busses, the virtual consoles are screwed up (using
vesafb). When the output reaches the bottom of the screen, it just stops,
and the rest of the output isn't visible. Using ctrl-L or switching VT
cleans it up temporarily. It occurs on all VTs and is 100% reproducible
here when booting with the above argument. Everything works fine when
booting without the pci argument.
