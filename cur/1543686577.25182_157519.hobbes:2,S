I am using a 2.4.20 kernel. I tried your program.
First, it didn't compile. So I would guess that you
never tested your test program. I fixed it and I
made a more readily useful Makefile, etc., so others
can try it, too. It is attached.
It works. It doesn't eat any resources. I guess that
the stuff that actually does 'work' in your actual
driver module is what is consuming resources.
Although making and deleting a number of kernel threads
is an interesting exercise, I sure hope that you don't
really do this in a real application. It is very expensive
to do this. If you need a kernel thread, you should have
one (or several) that do the work and never exit.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
