If it is a library, then it should be prepared to serve all possible users.

"Don't" in terms of "currently don't": Once x86-64 wants to support more
than 46 physical address bits, it's not impossible that this would lead to
CONFIG_HIGHMEM getting introduced there, and then it'll be helpful that the
code is already prepared to deal with that case.
After all, the code portion in question ought to compile to nothing if
!CONFIG_HIGHMEM.
