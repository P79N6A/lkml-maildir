Me too with 2.6.15 on asus m6r. In 2.6.14 helped ec_burst=1 kernel parameter. I
will try few things with that and let you know (tomorrow or the day after).
It is broken since 2.6.14 times, IIRC 2.6.13 was OK.
I have also problems with irqs I found out yesterday. Don't know if it does have
sth. to do with this [acpi] problem (I mean LOC: 4394987, ERR: 891474, timer is
4394964).
regards,
