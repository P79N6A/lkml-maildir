Hello,

   Actually, I think there should exist two different versions -- one
for 2.3 which would make use of all the new PCI/resource stuff and a
backward-compatible one for 2.0--2.2. It would be better than one code
with zillions of #ifdef's and routines for doing things handled by the
generic code since ages.

   Donald, I appreciate your excellent driver work, but I think that in this
case, you're wrong.
   The PCI code in 2.2 cannot be harder to use even if the only reason were
that it's backward-compatible with the one in 2.3 :-)  Also, can you tell
me any concrete example where the new PCI interface is harder to use?
   Maybe the resource code in 2.3 is designed suboptimally, but I'm sure we
really need such a thing if we want to support hot-pluggable devices and
other fancy stuff.  Besides the problems with maintaining backward-compatible
drivers, what are the negative benefits?
				Have a nice fortnight
