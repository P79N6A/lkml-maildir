We need to use the CMPXCHG instruction for fast locking, and this
instruction is not available on the 386.  Would it be sufficient if we
compiled using the CMPXCHG instruction and then did a run-time test for the
386 and never executed this instruction?  This is approximately what we did
before 2.3.31.  (386s are too slow to make direct-rendering a viable
option, so we don't support the DRI on 386s [and all modern graphics cards
are PCI or AGP, and most (all?) 386s don't have these busses available].)
I'll CC Richard Henderson, since this impacts i386 and Alpha kernel include 
files.  The other alternative is to implement the generic cmpxchg routine
for 386's using other instructions, but this seems like a waste of effort
if no one will ever use the routine.
