Is there something special I'm supposed to do to enable MTRR with the
K6-2 stepping 12 processor?  My understanding was that they were
supposed to work with stepping 8/9 and above.  My further understanding
was that /proc/mtrr was supposed to be created automagically.  Am I
doing something wrong, or has Linus not include the K6--2 MTRR fixes in
the current kernels? If not, then, when?
