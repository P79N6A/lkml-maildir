   Err...  That should be
   +module_init(init_netlink)
   +module_exit(cleanup_netlink)
That's exactly what I said.
Al, are you able to read any of my emails?  I sent you one last week
with a patch for fs/proc/task_mmu.c warnings on 64-bit and it
aparently went to the bit bucket... maybe all my mails aren't
making it your way :(
