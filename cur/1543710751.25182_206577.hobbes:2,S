And what if the underlying filesystem is RW too? What should happen if you
unite several (>= 3) filesystems? What if some are RO, others RW? What do
you do if a file shows up several times, each different?
Assuming one RW on top of a RO only now: What should happen when a
file/directory is missing from the top? If the bottom one "shows through",
you can't delete anything; if it doesn't, you win nothing (because you will
have to keep a complete copy RW on top).
IIRC, this has been discussed a couple of times before, and the consensus
each time was that it isn't /that hard/ to do, it is /hard or impossible/
to find a sensible, simple semantics for this. The idea was then dropped...
