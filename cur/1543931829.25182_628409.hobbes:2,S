This is normal.  IN from port 0x80 is used by the DMA address map chip.
As far as I understand, there are other laptops with the same chipset 
which don't have this problem, so it's likely either a motherboard or 
firmware issue.  My guess is that they probably let debugging code out 
in the field (trap port 0x80 in SMM, and then try to output it on some 
debugging bus.)
