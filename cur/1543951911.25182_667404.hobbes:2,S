Right, it makes use of any capability it can get its hands on,
otherwise fall back to software.

Yes, and that is what happens in most cases.  The additional
prep_dma_interrupt method is for two special cases:
1/ Locations where code is submitting an indeterminate number of
operations and wants an interrupt (callback) at the completion of the
chain.  Someting like:
list_for_each_entry()
     async_memcpy()
async_trigger_callback()
2/ For supporting channel switching on, for instance, a memcpy->xor
chain where chan1 supports memcpy and chan2 supports xor.  When
async_tx sees this it injects an interrupt for chan1.  The xor
operation gets kicked off by the bottom half of the chan1 interrupt
handler.  However, if chan1 can do both operations no interrupt is
needed.

Dummy descriptors that do nothing but cause an interrupt is the intent.
