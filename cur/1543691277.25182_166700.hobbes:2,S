Well, yes, I was using either -j2 or -j4 (on a single processor machine).
[[ Somehow, the 2.6.0 compiles seem REALLY SLOW compared to the 2.4.x and
previous compiles ]].
But the patch didnt seem to solve the problem, I still see:
Root device is (3, 7)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 2544 bytes.
System is 1826 kB
Kernel: arch/i386/boot/bzImage is ready
sh arch/i386/boot/install.sh 2.6.0-test5 arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map ""
No module aic7xxx found for kernel 2.6.0-test5
mkinitrd failed
make[1]: *** [install] Error 1
make: *** [install] Error 2
when I type 'make install'.  The 'make bzImage' itself went just fine.
This was after a 'make mrproper'.
As suggest (by someone else) I guess I can just do the install by hand,
but this dependence on aic7xxx is VERY strange.
