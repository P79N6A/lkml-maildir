I had tried turning off pre-emption, with little
difference. However linux had the same properties
before there was such a setting (of liking to
drop packets here and there for no apparent
reason under heavy load), so I didn't expect it
to make a huge difference. It seems typing on the
keyboard has the same effect with or without
pre-emption enabled. 
IP is not involved in this test, so no IP stack
issues should be relevent.
