Let me put it another way: have you actually experienced any lockups
with a vanilla (that is, with no patches applied) 2.6.24-rc6 kernel?
Try first with "force_amd_c1e". So far, all I see is that you're
getting nohz/dynticks working with my patch, and that's okay, it's the
expected behavior. But I seriously doubt that it's my patch that keeps
your system from locking up. I'm not bugging you just to clarify this
matter, but if your system locked up iff (as in both necessary and
sufficient) the patch was _not_ applied, that would be a really serious
issue.
