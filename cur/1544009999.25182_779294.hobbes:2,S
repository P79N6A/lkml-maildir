I really only care about resetting fixmap_top.  Adding more vmalloc
space to accomodate what we stole is just being nice... in practice this
should not be a problem.

For now, misuse vmalloc=XXX at your own risk - why the need for it
anyway?
I agree, it should be cleaned up, as HPA suggests, we should move the
fixmap to a fixed place anyways, and have vmalloc area from the top of
linear memory down to the end of the physical memory mapping.  But there
really isn't time to do anything better for 2.6.28.
