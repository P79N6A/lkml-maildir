Sniffle, whimper.  It is clearly different in that it calls out to the
BSD allocation policy, which is completely different.
However, if you diff the code, there is more than enough which is the same
that there is now way you can call that a rewrite of bmap().  I was wrong in
saying it was bit for bit identical, but other than showing me to be a clutz,
it doesn't detrack from the point.
But I'm headed for he ward.  Sniff.

Is this theory or practice, Alan?  We're not talking about pure copyright,
we're also discussing derived works.  And anyway, I'd like you to cite a
case where two independently developed substantial chunks of code compile
to the same expression tree.  I'm sure you can find strcmp() implementations
which do, but I'd be surprised if you could find a stdio implementation that
was, and you sure as hell won't find two file system implementations that do.
Righ?  Or do you have a counter example?
