Doesn't sound like something that should be supported for mainline
then.

You can use kernel_fpu_begin()/_end() around the FP code in the
kernel, but the real time people will probably hate you for it because
it disables preemption.

There are plenty of interval timers in various hardware in a typical
system that can be used.  e.g. RTC is a common choice. Drawback is
that you might conflict with other users, especially in user space.
But please don't try to submit such a hack.
