 Hi, 
 I wanted to increase the number of sectors that
 could be requested/Written  per SCSI READ(10)/WRITE
 command , and varying MAX_SECTORS in blkdev.h helped
me to do it. However I could not request more than 256
 sectors and could not write more than 1024 inspite of
 changing MAX_SECTORS to higher numbers. 
 Why is that? There is probably some other variable
 that should be varied. Please let me know if anyone
has an idea. 
 I am working on the UNH iSCSI initiator driver , and
 am on kernel 2.4.29 .
