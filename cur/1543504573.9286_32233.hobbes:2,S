Yes, long names are most like symlinks.

I just did "strace tar xf -" to check what happens. Symlinks ought
to work just fine! (tar does not remove existing files)
-- The Rules --
1. When a symlink (long name) is created, the file it refers to is
   also created. You get a zero-length normal file.
2. mkdir() can turn an empty file into a directory. (gross)
3. Removal of a file automatically removes any symlinks.
4. When moved between directories, file-symlink pairs go together.
5. There are various other odd limitations on name length, etc.
6. When a normal file is created with a long name, you get a
   symlink pointing to a normal file with 8.3 name format.
   (this may allow somewhat normal filesystem use)
