I don't really know how to tell except
'grep CONFIG_NET_HW_FLOWCONTROL driverfiles'
You said that the cards where 100Mbit DEC cards, I assumed that by that
you meant that the cards use DECchip 21143 or similar chips.
If that's true you can use Robert & Jamal's optimised drivers.
Sorry to hear that your employer doesn't see the importance in such a test
:)

This sounds promising. So Linux had nice variations until it broke down
completely and stopped routing because of all the interrupts. I can almost
guarantee that with the optimised driver and CONFIG_NET_HW_FLOWCONTROL
you'll see a _big_ improvement in routingperformance.
