Pekka, thank you very much for your patch. It looks like things are
working now:
dmesg part:
b44.c:v0.95 (May 15, 2004)
...
eth0: Broadcom 4400 10/100BaseT Ethernet 00:08:02:e2:2d:ba
ip_tables: (C) 2000-2002 Netfilter core team
b44: eth0: Link is down.
b44: eth0: Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex.
b44: eth0: Flow control is off for TX and off for RX.
I have tried moving large packets, NFS, ping etc ... no problem
anymore, it works.
Thanks again!
