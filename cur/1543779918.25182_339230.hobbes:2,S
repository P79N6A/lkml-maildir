I assume this is some sort of ordering/dependency problem.  I don't think
we're going to get onto fixing it for 2.6.13, I'm afraid.
It would really help if you could raise a bug report at bugzilla.kernel.org
so that it doesn't get forgotten.  In that report, please identify the most
recent kernel version whcih worked correctly, if any.
Thanks.
