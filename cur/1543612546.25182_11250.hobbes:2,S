Hi Rusty,
Your per-cpu area patch looks like a good solution with a very simple
implementation. BTW, some OSes map the per-cpu data areas
to the same virtual address for each CPU avoiding the per-cpu data
array lookup. I am not sure if this really saves much, we are ourselves
trying to understand the overhead of such array lookup with 
statctrs. 
IIUC, we can declare statically allocated per-cpu data using 
this allocator (kstat, apic_timer_irqs etc.). For things that
are a part of dynamically allocated structure, we would still
need to use a dynamic per-cpu allocator, right ?
Another interesting question is how we can load different
per-cpu sections to different areas in memory. I would suspect
that for NUMA, we would want to locate the per-cpu sections closest
to the corresponding CPUs.
I couldn't find the /proc patch. Any pointers ?
Thanks
Dipankar
