Yes, but I don't think you get symbolic information from modules.

It's *much* better.  You can debug device drivers and interrupt code
easily.  You can set breakpoints anywhere you want.  
The only thing to watch is that although the gdbstub patch turns on "-g"
for the kernel compilation, it doesn't turn of "-fomit-frame-pointer".
Debugging with frame pointers is much better since you then get full
stacktrace information when you enter the debugger.
