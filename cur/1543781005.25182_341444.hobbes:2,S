 You may have a look at how we've solved this for MIPS, where we have a 
mixture of bus arrangements for different platforms, starting from pure 
ISA/EISA ones, ones with PCI and a PCI-(E)ISA bridge, legacy-free PCI ones 
and systems with no Intel-style buses at all, like TURBOchannel ones.  
See "asm-mips/mach-generic/ide.h" for a simple solution that fits all so 
far.  I'm not sure whether the most recent version of the file has been 
merged upstream -- you may have to have look at: 
"
http://www.linux-mips.org/cvsweb/linux/include/asm-mips/mach-generic/ide.h"
 
instead.
