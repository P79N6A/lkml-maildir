Basically, you'll have no decent way to preserve that when you unpack.
In our case we _can_ do that; in general there is no portable way to
create such links (semantics of link(2) wrt following links differs
even between Linux versions, let alone various Unices).
cpio(1) includes the symlink body with each instance and doesn't
even bother trying to link(2) them when unpacking.
