Subject: Can't play audio CD's with ide-scsi

When I use ide-scsi for my cd-rw drive, it can't play audio CD's.  The
CDROMPLAYTRKIND ioctl returns EOPNOTSUPP and the kernel says:
sr0: CDROM (ioctl) reports ILLEGAL REQUEST.
This is kernel 2.2.10pre2 and a Sony CRX100E drive.  Audio works fine if
I don't use ide-scsi, but then cdrecord doesn't work...
Does this work for anyone?  Is it a kernel bug, or my drive?
TIA
