basically i want some counter w/ microsend resolution that fits into 32 bits.
couple of possible solutions come to my mind:
[1]  use TSC and convert it to microsec
[2] use get_timeofday( ) and convert to microsec
[3] use xtime variable directly and convert to microsec
(any other ways?)
conversion in [1] will be costly (a div involved). 
conversion in [2]/[3] can be done using bit operators. (usec|sec << 20)
but [2] will incur function call overhead which i'd like to avoid.
so is using xtime directly ok and reliable?
thanks
