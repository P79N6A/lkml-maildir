Thanks and glad I could help.

How often did you plan on enabling/disabling the nmi_watchdog?  My
understanding was you disable nmi_watchdog, run oprofile/perfmon,
re-enable nmi_watchdog.  I guess I don't understand what type of funky
scenarios you are dealing with.

It's not.  In fact I wouldn't know what to do in such situations.  Is it
really wrong to only have a subset of cpus being monitored by the
nmi_watchdog?  This seems to be wandering into the area where the user is
looking to do something complicated (profiling a subset of cpus) and as
such might be expected to make sure the nmi_watchdog is properly enabled
on all cpus when they are done.
Cheers,
Don
