If the last commit was interrupted, it didn't happen, so your tree stays
in the same state as before doing the commit, as well as the repository.
You can just try again. If you want to get rid of dirty stuff,
cg-cancel.

If it was a tree merge, cg-admin-uncommit will undo it. If it was
fast-forward merge, there is no direct way to uncommit it, but you can
find the first fast-forwarded commit and pass it as argument to
cg-admin-uncommit; it will then rewind all the commits up to (including)
the given commit.

"Trunactes"? That sounds very wrong... you mean replace with old
version? Anyway, what if the file has same length? It just doesn't make
much sense to me.
