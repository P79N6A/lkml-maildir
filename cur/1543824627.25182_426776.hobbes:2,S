I believe I gave a complete explanation the first round.
By having an extra extern variable you can export the offset of
a variable on the control code page, or what you need to compute
the offset.

Yes. I dislike your patches, but I don't dislike what you are trying to do.
Part of the reason is you do more than one thing at a time, which makes
review much more difficult than it needs to be.

I call them as I see them, and probably if I am a little frustrated I
may be a little more extreme.  Usually I find that I have too much
implied content and don't explain why I consider something abuse
for example.
In the above quoted section I figure it is abuse to place what only needs
to be an array of local variables in a global structure.
