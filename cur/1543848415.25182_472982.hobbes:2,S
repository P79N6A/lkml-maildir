I've rechecked behaviour of e1000 driver. For me, it looks like this:
2.6.18 (vanilla): e1000 as a module - system reboots OK.
                  e1000 built in    - system hangs after KBD reset or tripple
		                      fault
2.6.19-rc1-git9 (vanilla): e1000 as a module - system reboots OK.
                           e1000 built in    - system reboots OK.
