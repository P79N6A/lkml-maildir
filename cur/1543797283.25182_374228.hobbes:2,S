This sounds like the typical nightmare that never is 100% accurate and
needs lots of mainteinance (developers not updating the wiki, etc) as
Lee Revell pointed out.
IMO the one way of creating such database is automating it. If you
could get a list of the device IDs supported by drivers you 
could (?) use the pciid/usbid/whatever list to build a user-readable
database of the devices supported by the linux tree. Maybe it won't
100% perfect but...
