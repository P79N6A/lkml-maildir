Typically this indicates disk, memory or chipset problems. If your disk is
in UDMA33/66 mode you can pretty rule the disk out as the data is
protected
If you have a VIA chipset, especially if there is an SB Live! in the machine
then that may be the cause (fixes in 2.4.8-ac, should be a fix in 2.4.9 but
Linus tree also applies another bogus change but which should be harmless)
