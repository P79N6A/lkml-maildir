I looked at www.kingmax.com/support and found that they apparently
mean that they don't do bug-fixes. They provide a Linux driver
for their PCMCIA KEN0100-AF Driver.
It's a Phil Katz self-extracting DOS file, containing a LINUX
subdirectory. In that directory is EN0101A.TAR. Extracting that
from Linux, provides the source-code for a driver, complete with
a makefile and a readme file.
So it seems that they "provide for", rather than "support", Linux.
Maybe someone should thank them and tell them about the misleading
information.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
