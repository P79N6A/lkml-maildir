Subject: [PATCH] fbdev: Fix usage of blank value passed to fb_blank
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The fb_blank() hook accepts 5 blanking levels which include 1 level designed
for console use only.  Userspace is only aware of 4 levels. Thus, it's
possible for userspace to request VESA_VSYNC_SUSPEND which, in turn, is
interpreted by the fb driver as a request for FB_BLANK_NORMAL. A few drivers
return -EINVAL for this, confusing userspace apps that the driver may not
have VESA blanking support.
Fix by incrementing the blank value by one if the request originated from
userspace.

Yes.  The change will be invisible to drivers.
Unfortunately, this may cause some userland breakage.  X should work.
However, some apps may have been developed that uses the FB_BLANK constants
(DirectFB?).  In these cases, they'll get a deeper blank level instead, so it
probably won't affect them significantly.  A follow up patch that hides the 
FB_BLANK constants may be worthwhile.
