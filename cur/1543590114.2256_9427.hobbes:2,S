Dont know about the s390 - but on some hardware you get notification when
someone presses the hotswap request button.  You would then be requiried
to move all the data on the memory elsewhere.  Then you tell the hardware
it is ok to hotswap.  On many systems this will make the little LED light
up to say the hotswap is safe :)
