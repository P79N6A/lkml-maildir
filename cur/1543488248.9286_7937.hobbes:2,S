Bludgeon me blue Alan, but that's a pretty sad configuration management
system.
The problem in sock.h is easy enough to see, but there's no record of
who made _any_ changes, let alone the change which broke it.  No
indication of when the changes occurred.  No indication of which kernel
versions they were in. No process for backing out the changes, no
process for locating new changes, and all that good stuff.
I appreciate that the developers appear to be comfortable with this
state of affairs, although I can't for the life of me understand why
:-).  For the sake of the _users_ of the developers' efforts: Roll on
BitKeeper!
BTW: I note sock.h has "struct sk_filter" as well as "int
sk_filter(...)".  Are you OK with that?

Unless he's hit by a bus.
