Tom,
TRACE_BUG_ON_LOCKED(!spin_is_locked(&lock->wait_lock));
_is_ correct.  Those locks must be locked at those cases.  If it isn't
then we wan't to trigger a bug.  Hence the "BUG_ON" part.  You can never
guarantee that a lock will be unlock since another process on another
CPU might have it.
Now if you are getting a BUG, where as one of these places the lock is
_not_ held, then that's a bug.
Hmm, I wonder if these should be switched to __raw_spin_is_locked.
Oh wait, is this a UP system?  Shoot, spin_is_locked on UP is defined as
zero so this _would_ trigger. Ouch!
Ingo, I guess we need a TRACE_BUG_ON_LOCKED_SMP() macro.
