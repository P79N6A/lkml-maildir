Don't we already have something like that.  On an SN2 near me at this
time, running 2.6.9-rc1-mm4:
# pwd
/sys/devices/system/node/node0
# ls -lt cpu? | cut -c33-
         0 Sep 15 00:50 cpu0 -> ../../../../devices/system/cpu/cpu0
         0 Sep 15 00:50 cpu1 -> ../../../../devices/system/cpu/cpu1
This tells me that CPUs 0 and 1 are on node 0.
