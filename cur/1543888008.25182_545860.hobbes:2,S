Fair enough.  512 it is.

'Victim inode' sounds good.  Will do.

I don't know.  With the current limit of 2^31, a sufficiently large
device can reach the limit.  And it is imaginable that overflowing the
s32 number space can expose security holes.  Not that I actually know,
the check is pure paranoia.

I could.  Wear leveling will cause changes in the area, so I'll have a

I like the idea.  Do conversion function exist both way?
What I don't get is the year-2038 bug.  Isn't that the 31bit limit,
while 32bit would last to 2106?

Sounds good.  Will do.

Because after a while I discovered how silly it is to start every
function with logfs_.  That prefix doesn't add much unless the function
has global scope.  What I didn't do was remove the prefix from older
functions.

Looks like Peter Zijlstra is already working on a btree library.  His
code is more complete and likely faster than mine:
http://programming.kicks-ass.net/kernel-patches/concurrent-pagecache/21-rc6/cpc-test.patch
My secret hope is that his code is merged soon and I can just remove
mine.

Truncate to zero sounds like the 99.99% solution.  I like it.

super.c is a dump space for functions that don't have a good place
otherwise.  Maybe the accessor functions should go into mtd.c.
What would make more sense than renaming them is to hide them in a
struct logfs_device_ops and only have static functions.  Then another
set can be named bdread(), bdwrite(), etc. and live in bd.c.

I doubt it.  Guess I'll just remove the completion thing and wait for
LogFS to be broken in 2350 instead.

What would a better name be?  I had expected to find a similar function
somewhere in lib/string.c, right between memcmp() and memscan().  JFFS2
has some similar home-brewn code.  Maybe others as well.  Maybe a
function like this should go in lib/string.c?
/**
 * memchr_inv - Find a character in an area of memory.
 * @s: The memory area
 * @c: The byte to search for
 * @n: The size of the area.
 *
 * returns the address of the first character other than @c, or %NULL
 * if the whole buffer contains just @c.
 */
int memchr_inv(const void *s, int c, size_t n)
{
	const unsigned char *p = s;
	while (n-- != 0) {
		if ((unsigned char)c != *p++) {
			return (void *)(p - 1);
		}
	}
	return NULL;

I don't.  Note to self: move this to userspace to avoid any further
embarrassment.

It should go down to LOGFS_EMBEDDED_FIELDS == 17, I believe.  16 direct
pointers are nice, as there are also 16 special inodes.  And a single
indirect pointer is sufficient if the inode also has a height field.  If
an access beyond 64KiB has to go through double indirection instead of
single indirection, that will hardly show up in benchmarks let alone
real life.
Part of me would like to make such a change now before the format is
fixed.  Another part wants to finally release LogFS and rather keep the
inodes as-is than have people suffer JFFS2 limitations much longer.
The change will happen either way.  Whether it should follow with an
INCOMPAT feature flag or be done now is the only question.
