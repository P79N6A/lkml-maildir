Frankly i don't see the difference between this and the annual reoccurring "why can't the kernel messages be localized" discussion.
(Which is a little overdue, but maybe this replaces it this time.)
I could see the point in ONE "HOWTO" file per language to get people started, but everything else is a pointless exercise.
A developer/bug-reporter has to be able to express him-/herself in English and understand English, otherwise you can not accomplish very much.
All the points of the localized-messages discussion:
- You have to have a common language, otherwise you can't communicate.
- The translation will per definition be out of sync
- Translations tend to introduce (translation-)errors
- ...
also apply here.
A little anecdote:
Very Long ago (last millennium i think) SuSE defaulted to a german translated kernel for one release of their distribution. (And optionally for a few more)
But even though i'm german i couldn't understand a single word.
And here is the FAQ-Entry about the annually reoccurring discussion:

cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
