    In my case I was actually trying to use pipe/socket handle
    as a synchronisation point. to signal threads to wake-up at
    programme shut-down.
    But yes - you are right. This approach is prone to errors.
    It looks like in this kind of situations /dev/epoll should be used - 
    when set of fds is defined before. and all operations on this set 
    can be easily synchronized.
    Sure if /dev/epoll can handle closing of fd correctly - and will
    remove it from set.
