Not quite, but close. Those that know are willing
to read the kernel code, including that of past
releases, can certainly use the statm file.

Not at all. The free command is not per-process,
and doesn't ever deal with address space. It deals
with RAM.
For example, on a typical i386 box, you have almost
3 GB of address space available. (minus a bit at the
top for syscall handling, and perhaps minus a page at
address 0) The portion of this in use is of interest.

For that, go directly to /proc/*/maps and be happy.
You may also want the RSS from /proc/*/status.
