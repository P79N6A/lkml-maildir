    ... there have ... been
    claims that some of the utilities used with Linux can and will mangle
    partitions over 2G in size on 32-bit architectures.
Such rumour-mongering is harmful for Linux.
Either it is false, and then spreading such rumours is a very bad idea
(one hears the same false statements about the size of swap partitions
being repeated for more than five years, no amount of contradiction
suffices to kill the falsehood)
or there really are utilities with such problems, and then they should
be fixed.
I have used partitions of 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 GB for years, and roughly speaking
never seen a problem. ("Roughly speaking" because once I noticed a flaw in
mke2fs, which subsequently was fixed by tytso.)
So, please stop stating such things unless you know about a flaw, and in the
latter case speak up, and an hour later that particular flaw will be gone.
