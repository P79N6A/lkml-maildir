There might be a noticeable performance impact to making it truly 
modular. Calling a function in a module is slower. In some tests, I see 
a 5 to 10% drop in performance when Ethernet driver is a module versus 
builtin.
You might want to look at how the I/O schedulers are configured as an 
example.

Because the kernel developers who hold the collective copyright on the 
existing GPL TCP code do not want some vendor producing a closed source 
binary module of "enhanced TCP".
