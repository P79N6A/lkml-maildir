Proprietary was a poor choice of words on my part.

Yes, this is basically what I was getting at, although I was thinking
more in terms of the reiser5/6/whatever set theoretic semantics, which,
from my point of view at least, reiser4 is simply the first step towards
building the enabling infrastructure of. But the fact that reiser4
semantics + trivial shell scripting enables, as illustrated by David,
the rough equivalent of set-theoretic semantics, demonstrates how
reiser4 is in fact a step in this direction.

90% of *what* exactly? 90% of what machines deal with, or 90% of what
humans interact with?

No, obviously that's not what I was saying. But the need for these kinds
of domain-specific packaging/metadata formats, each requiring their own
tools to work with, would be alleviated if there were simply a more
powerful filesystem semantic. Clearly forcing reiser on the world is a
non-starter, but try extending your imagination a little bit to a future
in which there's a 'new POSIX' specifying a set-theoretic filesystem
model. So-called 'database-filesystems' ARE coming, whether from
Microsoft, Apple, or us. Who gets there first will determine who gets to
make the rules.
