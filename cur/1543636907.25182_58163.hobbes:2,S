Bill Irwin has told me about a rare bug with exec() mapping
garbage into the address space of a process, which might
trigger this bug check the next time that process exec()s.
I've gotten two reports of this bug now, but have no idea
what particular combination of hardware / compiler / config
triggers the bug. The rmap code seems to have survived akpm's
stress tests so it's probably not a simple bug to track down ;/

Rik
