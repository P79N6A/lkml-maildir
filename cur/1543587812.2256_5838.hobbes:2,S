Just a another FAQ entry based on my experience
I've found that home.com and home.se are messing with MAPI extensions.
At home, you are able to setup your own rules, just like any reasonable 
MAPI server,
but I guess they are doing it wrong, or, I'm getting it wrong.
This is what I did,
I set up my email rule to move all messages from @vger to a separate folder 
on the mail server.
On home.se this is done through a web interface were you can setup basic 
email features like rules.
The mails are getting nicely to the new folder, but I can't download it 
from the email client,
Eudora. Just removing the rule helped, but, now I can't read my email over 
the web interface...
It's a tough mans world.
I guess that either Eudora is not communicating with the mail server correctly
or, the mail server are storing the mails in separate storage instead of 
sorting them for the display
view.
