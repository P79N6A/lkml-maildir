[this message was previously cc'ed to tulip-bug]
It seems that my Xircom report refuses to work correctly when first
initialized. I'm running Linux 2.4.0-test7 with the standard
xircom_tulip_cb driver. I can get the Xircom to work just fine, but I
seem to always need to go through a song and dance to do so.
When the driver is first initialized, ifconfig eth0 with an IP and
adding the default route will not work correctly. To get the realport to
work, I have to:
# ifconfig eth0 a.b.c.d netmask x.x.x.x
# ifconfig eth0 down
# ifconfig eth0 up
# route add default gw l.m.n.o
As soon as I bring it back up for the second time, it mysteriously
starts working correctly.
Here are the relevant kernel messages on boot:
