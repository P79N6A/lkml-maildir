Well, what I meant was that the pointer "current->mm" doesn't change, 
since that is what we store in the futex key union.

And if I understand correctly, we would catch this scenario any time we 
try to use uaddr and find it faulting (during the cmpxchg* calls for 
example).  If the mmap changes too much, we'll exhaust our fault 
tolerance (3) and exit with -EFAULT back to userspace.
Sound right?
Thanks for the review Peter,
