Either that, or, Linus gets tired of seeing mixed syntax in his tree,
does the 'sed' himself, and removes the compatibility parsing.  Linus
has never been afraid to force the hand of a port maintainer.
Remember what happened to the old-style Rules.make syntax just before
2.4 went gold.
Actually I suspect it would be more like the C99 thing: after the new
syntax is added, we start doing [TRIVIAL] patches to clean out the
old, and eventually once that is done we have the option of removing
the old syntax or leaving it in as a known oddity.  I'd favor removing
it, but people who maintain exarboralities for both 2.4 and 2.6 would
not thank me.

A good reason to excise the $ case from the tree at first opportunity.
Sure, it would cause complaints from people getting too many .rejs
from personal trees.  But dang it, it's just one line of sed.  (Or
'ed' / 'perl -wpi' for in situ editing, depending on whether or not
you're Al Viro.)

Yeah, that's the real reason 'n'!='' is Considered Harmful (and warned
about in the docs even now).
