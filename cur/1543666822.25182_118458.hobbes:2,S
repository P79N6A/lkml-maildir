It should never be failing, on 2.4.18 or 2.5.x with ext3. You should
get log playbacks on a crash and maybe an fsck every 27 if you set the
checking to run that way.
My first guess is you have something corrupting data - bad memory, bad
disk, overclocking or of course a software bug that you happen to hit
and nobody else seems to.
What drivers are you running
