Likely.

Unsure, depends on the LSM folks.

In progress of being merged from -dj -> mainline.

in -dj, being pushed next week when I get home.

A few last-minute niggles to work out, and this should go into mainline soon.

Probably a trivial merge once the more important vm changes have happened.

As per Greg's comment.

There are a few folks doing various i2c work outside the lm_sensors
scope, which could find its way into the tree if its ready in time.
The actual sensors stuff, unknown. There were issues with some laptops,
I don't know if they got resolved ?

Hopefully ready in time.

Ready-to-merge.

Andrew ?

Depending on how busy Arnaldo gets I guess. Non-critical.

Yep. For example, how /dev/disk/ or whatever ends up working is still unclear
to myself and a few other folks.
Other items you listed in the post-freeze section that really needs
doing before the freeze imo:
 > o LVM (Logical Volume Manager) v2.0               (LVM team)
LVM1 in 2.5 is badly borken, Sistina don't want to fix it, and whilst
there is some work getting it 'mostly functional' in my tree, ongoing
development of LVM1 is counterproductive when there is a superior
solution in the wings.  All depends on whether they can pull it off
before the freeze of course.
 > o Asynchronous IO (aio) support                   (Ben LaHaise)
Again, this is likely to happen sooner rather than after the freeze.
This will break large amounts of kernel code, and having non-compilable
kernels /after/ the freeze is undesired considering we are then in the
'get things stable' zone.
 > After feature freeze:
Quite a few of these you listed either should wait until 2.7 or
get in before the freeze.  Some of them require non-trivial changes
to critical areas which we really shouldn't be poking too much in
an alleged 'stabilisation series'.
Instead I would rename this section 'non critical features' or
'nice to have' features. If they don't make it in time, there's
always 2.7
