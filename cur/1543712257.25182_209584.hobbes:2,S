A broader variety of controllers would indeed be helpful. When you have
the stuff integrated the way you think it's right, just tell me and I'll
test if it still works on our testbed.

Only if they have to read Microsoft specifications :-)

You probably underestimate the mental sensibility of Windows machines.
We have seen cases where the Windows host just floods you with
interrupts when it is not happy with things like these...

We have seen the packets with the protocol analyzer. I think we agree
that using an interrupt endpoint just to announce that the gadget has a
message for the host available, but that's how M$ designed it...

Win 98, XP, 2000. Auerswald currently tests all available other
variants, and the tests they invented are _really_ crazy ;)
