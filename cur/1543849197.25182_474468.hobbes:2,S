Does ATI Radeon card have an expansion ROM (video ROM)?
Could you show me "lspci -vv" on sparc64?
If an expansion ROM exists on ATI Radeon or ATY128 card, pci_map_rom returns
the expansion ROM base address instead of 0xC0000 because fixup_video checks
the VGA Enable bit in the Bridge Control register.
The Bridge Control register describes in "PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture
Specification Revision 1.2".
This specification is the standard specification in PCI.
