Two names, same issue.  I've heard some people use "priority inversion"
to describe the problem of a low-priority task holding a lock which
blocks a higher priority task, and "priority inheritance" to describe
the solution of increasing the priority of the blocking task.  However,
whichever term you use, everybody will understand what you mean. :)
