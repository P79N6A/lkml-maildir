While running video capture software, the kernel will eventually oops in kswapd. There do seem to be some different kernels where it will take longer for this to happen (possibly those with apic support) but so far I haven't been able to isolate them. The oops will only happen while video capture is happening otherwise the system is extremely solid.
The kernel being used is 2.4.21 patched with preempt, low-latency, bootsplash and variable hz (the hz was set to 200).
