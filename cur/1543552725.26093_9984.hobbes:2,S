Reports are that Microsoft has been broken into. Although
Microsoft spokesmen deny it, reports are that the source-
code for Windows/2000 (professional) has been copied to
a country in the former Soviet Union.
I thought that this stuff had already been "released", but
nobody wanted it because they couldn't read it.
Cheers,
