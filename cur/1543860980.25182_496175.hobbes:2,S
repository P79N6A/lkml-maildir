I hope I cut it down sensibly...

Works for me now with 2.6.20-rc3. Might have been some form of pilot error
(perhaps setting SCSI_TGT=m and/or SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC=y, I unset them for the
current trial run).
I see CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC introduced in
21db1882f79a1ad5977cae6766376a63f60ec414 ([SCSI] Add Kconfig option for
asynchronous SCSI scanning). If this is the cause, the override provided:
  scsi_mod.scan="sync"
seems not to work. Are the '"' necessary? How do you give them via silo,
which in its configuration file for strings with spaces uses:
  append="some string here"
How do you say '"'? The silo documentation is silent on this.
