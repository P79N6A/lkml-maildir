Tweaking SD_EXTRA_DEV in hosts.h did no good, at least for the Future Domain
driver.  From trial and error it appears that using the default detection
code only the last three SCSI devices, in SCSI ID order, are detected.  Was
there some other parameter I'm suppose to tune.  I tried changing
SD_EXTRA_DEV to 6, 7, and even played with SR_ and SG_.
