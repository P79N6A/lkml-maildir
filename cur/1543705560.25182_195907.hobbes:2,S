Yeah, this workaround because we can't add a new signal isn't very
good, though ("I can't add a new signal, so you choose!").  In
practice, it sucks for libraries and it sucks for children.
As you point out, DBUS is a better solution anyway.  Of course,
proposing that something which doesn't yet exist will solve all our
problems is usually a sign of laziness or optimism 8).
Cheers,
Rusty.
