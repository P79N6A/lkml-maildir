This is diffstat of compression/encryption patches:
 b/kernel/power/compression.c |   43 +++
 b/kernel/power/encryption.c  |   49 +++
 kernel/power/compression.c   |  559 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++--
 kernel/power/encryption.c    |  517 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++--
 4 files changed, 1115 insertions(+), 53 deletions(-)
..so we add 1000 lines of code for feature that can very well live in
userspace. All the filewriters/etc can live in userspace, too.
Could we improve suspend.sf.net code instead of trying to merge awful
lot of code that does not really belong into kernel?
I counted over 300 patches in this series....
