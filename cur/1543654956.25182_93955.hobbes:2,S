Oops, yes I missed setting fbbase to NULL at the start.

The field fbbase is kind of temporary at the moment, fixed for the
0xa0000 window.  I'm currently thinking of having the offset and the
size of the window optionally set by the calling process.

I hate hardwiring fixed numbers :)  It's also possible that some drivers
may find it sufficient to use the module to save the standard and its
own set of extended registers. 
But you're correct, 4 kmallocs is wasteful, I wasn't thinking straight
:-).  I'll just do one and adjust the offsets for each field.

Right, I'm not sure about this part too.  The docs say that this is true
for EGA compatible hardware.  How about non-compliant hardware?

Only if saving the first character map in plane 2.  Hardware can have as
much as 8 character maps per plane, each 8K in size for 64K.  The same
setup is true for plane 3 fonts.

To save memory, apps can explicitly choose what to save, but I don't
want to go finer than that, ie. save character maps 2,3,5  of plane 2
and 1,2,3 of plane 3.  The current way of saving the text mode map may
be a bit wasteful, but better than being bitten by hardware that's
non-EGA compliant.
