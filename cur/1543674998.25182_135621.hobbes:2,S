in case it wasn't obvious (that is the whole point of ksoftirqd) what
accomplishes in a single word is "fairness" and "not starving userspace
during networking".

sure, as far as you don't care about anything but the network load. I
mean, if you can't care less of the userspae progress and you don't want
the usual scheduler fariness guarantees, then you can hack the kernel
and replace the ksoftirqd with an infinite loop and networking will
certainly perform better since it will be able to stall indefinitely all
userspace computations in favour of pure irq driven networking I/O
running all in irq context and never ending.
I really thought this was obvious to everybody, otherwise there would be
no point for ksoftirqd at all if you can't care less to hang userspace
indefinitely.
