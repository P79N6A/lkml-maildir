For those wondering what this "11-minute mode" is, I'll quote the
man page for hwclock. ( 
http://linux.die.net/man/8/hwclock
 )

Automatic Hardware Clock Synchronization By the Kernel
You should be aware of another way that the Hardware Clock is kept 
synchronized in some systems. The Linux kernel has a mode wherein it 
copies the System Time to the Hardware Clock every 11 minutes. This is 
a good mode to use when you are using something sophisticated like ntp 
to keep your System Time synchronized. (ntp is a way to keep your 
System Time synchronized either to a time server somewhere on the 
network or to a radio clock hooked up to your system. See RFC 1305).
This mode (we'll call it "11 minute mode") is off until something 
turns it on. The ntp daemon xntpd is one thing that turns it on. You 
can turn it off by running anything, including hwclock --hctosys, that 
sets the System Time the old fashioned way.
To see if it is on or off, use the command adjtimex --print and look 
at the value of "status". If the "64" bit of this number (expressed in 
binary) equal to 0, 11 minute mode is on. Otherwise, it is off.
If your system runs with 11 minute mode on, don't use hwclock --adjust 
or hwclock --hctosys. You'll just make a mess. It is acceptable to use 
a hwclock --hctosys at startup time to get a reasonable System Time 
until your system is able to set the System Time from the external 
source and start 11 minute mode.

Apparently, drivers using one or more timer_lists typically arm the 
timer in their open or init function. My problem is: I don't think 
there is an init function for the NTP sub-system.
