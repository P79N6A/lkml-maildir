Does whatever defines what these escapes mean, have any comment to make
about UTF-8? If not, why can't we declare that UTF-8 mode is the "reset"
mode, the default that would be dropped to on a full reset, and if
anyone wanted to switch that out to non-default not-UTF-8 mode, they
could, but that a reset will always reenable it again..?
