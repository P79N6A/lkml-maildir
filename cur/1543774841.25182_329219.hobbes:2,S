Probably the code should use __BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD /
__LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD instead of __BIG_ENDIAN / __LITTLE_ENDIAN?
Anyway, the comment from the CVS commit suggests that it was tested.
I completely agree that this code is ugly as hell.
It was the obvious, simple fix to make the driver work on
PowerPC (and a few users happy), though. Rewriting the
driver not to use bitfields seems to be quite a bit of work.
Blame me for not paying enough attention when the initial
flexcop driver was submitted ;-(
