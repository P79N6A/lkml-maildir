Why don't you include the last sentence I wrote: "So,we should have more 
fruits (like ZFS,DTrace etc.) ;-) "
So, that's why I said it. Because, as all the time, we did it: Importing 
and exporting codes to/from different open source projects.

As I mentioned in my previous posts: This is **not** in the hands of the 
"OpenSolaris Community" to make and apply such decision. Sun itself 
**will decide** it. Also, there are strong indications that Sun is very 
interested to make "OpenSolaris" at least "Dual-Licensed" with GPLv3.
