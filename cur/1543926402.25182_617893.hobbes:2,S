Yeah, in the "machine is dying" case, we do make best effort to get the 
message out.  Worrying about a GPF on the off chance we happen to be 
modifying an immediate in that case seems crazy.

So that when it's printing a backtrace from an NMI.

Or, "if your system is crashing, this may make it worse".

stop_machine is necessary (although it could use simplification, patches 
pending).

Yet you could have implemented it in the time it took us to have this 
conversation.
Just because code is clever doesn't mean it should go in.  There are enough 
things in the kernel which have to be complex that we should always be on the 
lookout for things which can be made simpler.
Cheers,
