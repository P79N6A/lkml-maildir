Ummm, you can't use an in-kernel anything in a bootloader.  How do you
uncompress an in-kernel zlib.o without an out-of-kernel zlib.o lying
around somewhere?
The closest thing to a zlib.o shared between bootloader and kernel would
be to build one zlib.o and then perhaps copy the compiled binary from the
kernel to the bootloader (thus having only one zlib.c but two zlib.o) or
link it from the bootloader to the kernel once the kernel is uncompressed.
