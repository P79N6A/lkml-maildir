Please.

Yes.  We certainly need ->exit_state = -1.
Earlier I had forgotten about second the use of ->children to update
the parent pointer of processes when their parent exits.
There is a practical question how much we care about pstree being
confused (I assume it doesn't crash).  If this is just a confusion
issue then I say go for it.  PPID == 0 is a very legitimate way to say
the kernel is the parent process.
There are a few more cases where we are likely to get PPID == 0 in the
future and /sbin/init already has that now.  Plus there is a lot of
historic precedent.  The odd part is PPID = 0 having multiple
children.
If we decide maintaining a tree is important I would much rather put
init_task on the task_list so we can see it in /proc then go the other
way around.
I would like a confirmation that it PPID == 0 is what is confusing
pstree just to make certain we haven't half filled in some field
in init_task and are thus giving in correct /proc output.  But that is
all the double checking I would do.

Agreed.  I fixed that in sys_unshare but I should really submit a
patch to do the same for sys_clone at some point.
When know flags aren't implemented we certainly return -EINVAL.
Given that this line of work looks to fix the race that messes allows
a threaded init to generate unkillable zombies I can probably find
some time in the next while to work on it.
