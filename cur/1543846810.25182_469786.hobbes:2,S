Frustratingly, it usually doesn't tell us much (without my previous
patch), because it is normally some driver that has stuffed up their
refcounting and the page-> fields don't tell us where the page has
come from.

... this shouldn't hurt if gcc moves the unlikely code out of the
linear instruction stream, which I think it usually does. It shouldn't
cost _anything_ because we're already doing the branch for the BUG_ON
which you remove.
