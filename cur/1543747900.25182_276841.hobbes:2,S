Duh! how about using total_lowmem? i.e. use the current way for memory
between KERNEL_BASE and (KERNEL_BASE+total_lowmem),
and iopa for other addresses?

From a single virtual buffer, the DMA library will build a chained list of
physically contiguous buffers (it  can be one or more physical buffers).
All the DMA engines I'm familiar with (mpc8260, mpc8580, marvell, etc.)
accept a list of physical buffers.
The decoding algorithm (from a single virtual buffer to a chained list of
physical buffers) is dead simple.
Thanx for the reply
