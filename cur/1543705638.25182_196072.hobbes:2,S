I had tested new driver 2.4-20031222 with 2.4.25-pre6 and machine had 
permanent load about 1-1,5, commands like `ps aux` or `w` was take about 10
secunds. I had also problem with reboot, it stoped on "quota turn off", 
SysRq  didn't work. On 22 Jan 2004 I have sent dump from aic79xx 
controller to gibbs@scsiguy.com
With vanilla 2.4.25-pre6 +nohighmem.patch I have'n any problems
from 12 days. No ooops, no SCSI errors. :-)
UnfortunatelyI don't know that is it hardware problem, driver problem or
something else, that's why i have sent question to LKML.
Earlier SCSI errors (2.4.24 and 2.4.24-preX kernels):
