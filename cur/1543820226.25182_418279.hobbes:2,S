While that may be true[1], it gets a little annoying when broken is
meant to be synonymous to "not the SELinux model".  Especially since
there are aspects where SELinux' security can be considered broken,
complexity being one of them, crappy failure modes being another,
handling of new files a third, handling of namespaces a fourth.
Paths vs. inodes is religion, nothing else.  There are arguments for
and against on both sides.  LSM was supposed to be inclusive of all
beliefs, has that changed?
  OG.
[1] Why do we have uis and permission bits already?  After all, it's
not perfect hence broken, right?
