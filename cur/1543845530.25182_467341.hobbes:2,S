hi Haavard,

Can you possible rather rename it to ATMEL_MAX_UART ?
Since most AT91 board don't use all the UART's I've had a few reports of
people trying to limit the number of UART's "detected" by changing this
value - which of course can break things.  (They should be changing the
number of UARTs in their board-support files).
