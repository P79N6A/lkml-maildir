Well, kmalloc(0) has always been legal and traditionally returned a
pointer to a smallest non-zero sized object. We did try to make
kmalloc(0) illegal for a while but ended up fixing up a bunch of
call-sites for little or no gain. I did propose that kmalloc(0) should
return NULL but Linus and others pointed out that we can do better and
not mix up out-of-memory and zero-sized allocations.
