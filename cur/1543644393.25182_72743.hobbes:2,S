Daniel Jacobowitz, a stunning gcc hacker, suggests you retry with
gcc-3.2 from CVS.  Apparently some fixes have gone in since 3.2 release.
If the problem still occurs, there is either a serious problem in gcc or
we have some code that is miscompiled by gcc-3.2 (perhaps not its fault
but the kernel's).
