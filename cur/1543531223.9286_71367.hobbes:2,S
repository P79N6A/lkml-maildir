The daemon is still running and able to update data structures. OK, it
misses the first timeslice - but as soon as the process exhausts
physical memory and starts paging, it sleeps and the daemon can go to
work.

Priority in terms of "which is the most important to keep running",
NOT as in "nice". A 30-second old Netscape having grabbed 2Gb would be
disposable, for example; a three-week old simulation would not.

Not a major overhead, at least with memory overcommit and an efficient
implementation.

Yes there will; the kernel enforces rules set by the daemon.

And can be set based on system load etc. - if the system is heavily
laden, don't let people grab 2Gb each; during the night with 3 users
on, taking half the VM is fair enough.

If it crashes, that's a bug in the kernel. NOTHING to do with user
quotas, overcommit or the phase of the moon - just a bug crashing the
system under particular circumstances.

Again, you use a totally different meaning of "overcommit". In this
context, the term "overcommited quotas" is totally meaningless.

If the system crashes, then it IS buggy. Fix the bug. Or document it,
so someone else can fix it. Don't just complain about it, blaming it
on another part of the kernel.

Yes, you need quotas. You do NOT need to disable overcommit.
