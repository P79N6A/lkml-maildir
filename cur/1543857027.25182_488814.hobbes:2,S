I said *userspace ABI*. You're changing something that userspace has
known about and was documented since the start of Linux. So userspace
application binaries can break, and at least you're changing the rules
on them. That's fine if you know what you're doing.. but in a general
system... not a good default, hence the EMBEDDED.
I assumed entirely that you're not using binary drivers, those are just
horrid in the first place :)
