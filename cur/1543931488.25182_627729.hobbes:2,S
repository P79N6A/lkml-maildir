These issues only exist with NUMA because of the freeing of off node pages 
before the TLB flush was done. There was a discussion about this issue and 
my fix of simply not freeing the offnode pages early was ignored. Instead 
the x86_64 implementation (which has no problems that I know of) was 
pulled leaving the issue open in the core. Benjamin Herrrenschmidt 
wanted to take a look at these issues (CCing him).
Here is the fix again. Could we please reapply the x86_64 quicklist 
patch after applying this one? (I have another patch in testing that 
maintains separate lists for off and on node pages and frees all off node 
pages on flush but that one adds new capabilities).

[NUMA] quicklists: Do not release off node pages early
quicklists must keep even off node pages on the quicklists until the TLB flush
has been completed.
