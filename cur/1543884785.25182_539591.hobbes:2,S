Christoph, it's at
http://people.redhat.com/roland/utrace/crash-suspend.c
The file crash-suspend.c is a simple example of a loadable kernel module
using the new infrastructure.  It implements the old GNU feature of doing a
job suspend on crash, so you can attach a debugger right then instead of
just looking at the core file afterwards.  Try for example:
	$ sudo /sbin/insmod crash-suspend.ko pid=$$
to load the module and attach it to your shell.  It then attaches to any
children of your shell.  Now run something that crashes and would
ordinarily dump core--you can just run cat or sleep and hit ^\ to crash it
with a SIGQUIT.  See it suspend.  Try "jobs -l" and see it stopped with a
non-stop signal.  If you resume it with "fg" it will go ahead and dump
core.  Or, you can attach a debugger like gdb first, and then debug it.
Most certainly, it should be included into utrace patchset to pin some
exports.
