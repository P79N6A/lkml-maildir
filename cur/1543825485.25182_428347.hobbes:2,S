I use clocks for two purposes. Both have used sched_clock() so far.
The statistics infrastructure itself uses a clock only for time stamps
that tell users what time a statistic has been switched on/off and reset.
This is what you have spotted here.
(The other and more important requirement regards exploiters of the
statistics infrastructure. They need a clock to measure latencies,
which they can report then.)
Regarding those time stamps, I think it best to make them look like other
timestamps, specifically the printk() time stamps in order not to confuse
users. That is why, one of my patches introduces nsec_to_timestamp()
based on some lines from printk(). Printk() uses printk_clock() as
source, which is nothing else than a sched_clock() call, unless
reimpelmented by architectures (only done for ia64).
If I want similar timestamps, I need the same time source too.
Now my question:
Would I get away with making printk_clock() a timestamp_clock() that
should be used by anyone exporting nsec_to_timestamp()-formated time
stamps to user space, including me?
I would then continue to see the use of sched_clock() in printk_clock()
... aehm timestamp_clock() as somebody else's problem (or at least
as a subordinate problem).
Thoughts?  <ducking down>
