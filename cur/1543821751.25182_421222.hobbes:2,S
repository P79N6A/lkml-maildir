hi ebody,
i m working on linux kenel version-2.6.16.
i m calling function netpoll_send_udp tht is in
linux/net/core/netpoll.c in my module.
& i m passing it struct netpoll *np, but i don't knw how to set
net_device *dev in structure.
like if we see in netconsole module it is not assigning any device in
net_device in netpoll structure.
so im getting problem when i calls netpoll_send_udp in netpoll.c file
from my module.
please, can any one tell me how can debug this problem??
thanks
Priyanka
