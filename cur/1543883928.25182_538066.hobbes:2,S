Good point. Will fix. I just copied it from i386, but it probably
should be there fixed too.
Actually they are not completely equivalent because the old macro
generates the section name differently from the name in the payload
(kernelversion, Linux). But I split that up into two notes now.
If that is done on i386 it might break gdb reading core files though?
BTW if anybody noticed the patch also contained a few dead hunks (two unused functions/
prototypes and some white space change). These are already gone now too.
