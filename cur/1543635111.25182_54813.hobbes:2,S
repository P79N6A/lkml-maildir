Marcelo didn't seem against the idea, and as he's done a pretty good
job so far in 2.4, he seems to be the ideal guy for the job (time
permitting). At the time we get to 2.6.0, 2.4 should have slowed down
sufficiently that he'll be looking for something else to do.

When we get to 2.6, I'll do 2.6-dj's until the important bits are all
pushed to $maintainer, and keep the leftovers until 2.7-dj.
