Right, but *you* cannot change the license. You cannot get a copy of a
"GPLv2 or later" work and add some code and release the result as "GPLv3 or
later". (Assuming you are not the copyright holder.)
I believe the FSF intended to permit this. Otherwise, even if Linux had been
"GPLv2 or later" all along, it could not adopt GPLv3 without permission from
all copyright holders (or ever include any code that was "GPLv3 or later").
That hardly seems to have been the FSF's intent. (Or was it?!)
