See AF_RXRPC patch:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/04-af_rxrpc.diff
You turn on CONFIG_RXKAD and load the rxkad module thus built (assuming you
haven't built it in) after loading the af_rxrpc module.  I probably should've
mentioned that in the cover.
So anyone using sockets of family AF_RXRPC can use it.  See these test
programs:
 (1) The klog test program fetches a ticket from the kaserver and adds it as a
     key of type rxrpc:

 (2) The listen test program which listens for potentially secured incoming
     calls:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/listen.c
 (3) The rxrpc test program which can make secure calls:
