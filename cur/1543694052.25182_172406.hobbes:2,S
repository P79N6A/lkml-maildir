The money which he made from oil contract and he left an instruction with the Safe Keeping Company to release the money to me his wife and his son Ali who at that time was studying, that an Investor  should accompany us before the $12.5Million will be released to us for proper investment, and also for the welfare of the children which he left behind for me.
I plead with you to accept to help me and act as my investor trustee to manage the $12.5Million for me. We can both arrange on how to invest  this money into your company. We have agreed to give you 20% of the $12.5Million for your own assistance.
All the relevant documents shall be forwarded to you upon your  indications  to assist me in this project. May the Almighty God bless you, if you will of trust and faithful to  assist  me. Please contact me on the above e-mail address or my son Ali on his email address (aliabdul_2003@yahoo.com).
