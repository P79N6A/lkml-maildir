Sorry, I should have been clearer, I was only disagreeing with the last part: 
"There is also precisely zero relevance the benchmark has to anything real 
users would do."  Making kernbench run fast isn't a priority, but making sure 
it doesn't run slow and hurt other apps is important, so in that sense it's a 
useful benchmark, even if we're just using it as a load like you say above.

Huh?  I guess booting on a machine this big is something of a stress test. :)

Yep, me too (though kernbench *is* frighteningly easy to setup and run :).

Ok, thanks.
