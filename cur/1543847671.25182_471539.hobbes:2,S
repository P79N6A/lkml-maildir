Hmmm... Good point, but you still need to handle try_to_release_page() failing,
but that only means checking the return value of invalidate_inode_pages2_range
(which you don't do, I notice).  Or is it defined that if must succeed if
__GFP_WAIT is set?
With the two-phase thing, I think I'm thinking of the wrong portion of that
file (I'm thinking of truncate_inode_pages_range()).
Should invalidate_inode_pages2_range() take a gfp_t argument to pass on down?
