Agreed - they do share a _lto_ of the issues.

If you'd be willing to integrate your patches on top of andreas (and
massage them to be the _only_ getblk interface) and look what the
resulting thing looks like, I bet that there will be a lot of people
interested in working on any final remaining issues.
The devil is always in the details, but at the same time it ends up being
rather important to get some first "mostly-working" code to base further
refinements on, unless we want to just talk the problem to death ;)
