Wait up.. didn't _you_ create that __preempt_spin_lock thing!? ;)

Well currently it just enables preempt and spins like a mad man until the 
lock is free. The idea is to allow preempt to get some scheduling done 
during the spin.. But! if you accept this patch today, you get the 
i386 version which will allow your processor to halt until a write to the 
lock occurs whilst allowing interrupts to also trigger the preempt 
scheduling, much easier on the caches.
