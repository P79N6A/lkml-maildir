becasue memory map from e820(x86) or efi(ia64) are registered to iomem_resource,
we should avoid duplicates that information. kdump and memory hotplug uses
this information. (memory hotplug updates this iomem_resource.)
Implementing "page_is_exist" function based on ioresouce is one of generic
and rubust way to go, I think.
(if performance of list walking is problem, enhancing ioresouce code is
 better.)
