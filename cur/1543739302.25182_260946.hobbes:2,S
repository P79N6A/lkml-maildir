And they're not RSS-like right now if you pick them from statm, the only
RSS-like variable is rss itself in 2.6 ;).
	*data = mm->total_vm - mm->shared_vm
all those are virtual, not physical. dunno about 2.4, but I doubt 2.4
would be much different, rss + shared where the only physical driven
things in 2.4 IIRC. (now only rss is left, and Hugh's patch adds
anon_rss back)
to me TRS and DRS have always been _virtual_ when I read the ps output,
obviously since DRS tends to be orders of magnitude bigger than RSS
itself ;).

those should come out of statm pretty nicely.

that you can't get those values efficiently. Even assuming you're ok to
drop shared by disabling SHR, it wouldn't help, without a kernel API
change.

Yep, I believe users could be happy with Hugh's rss-anon_rss variant.
