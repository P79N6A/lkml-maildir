No, no, I don't disagree at all. In fact, I agree emphatically.
It's just that you need the scheduler to run them, in order to not "see" 
them as coroutines. Then, you can program everything *as*if* it was just a 
regular declarative linear language with multiple threads).
And that gets us the same programming interface as we always have, and 
people can forget about the fact that in a very real sense, they are using 
coroutines with the scheduler just keeping track of it all for them.
After all, that's what we do between processes *anyway*. You can 
technically see the kernel as one big program that uses coroutines and the 
scheduler just keeping track of every coroutine instance. It's just that I 
doubt that any kernel programmer really thinks in those terms. You *think* 
in terms of "threads".
