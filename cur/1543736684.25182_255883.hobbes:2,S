I presume you're not talking about doing swsusp over NFS. If so, there's
a lot more work to be done to teach the driver model and power management
infrastructure about the dependencies involved to make that a possibility.
It's safe to say that we don't support that, and won't support that at
least for some time.
As far as the firmware goes, there are two choices - reload it from
userspace once we return or save it memory during suspend. I assume that
these devices provide some means for reading the firmware from them, so
you can just allocate a buffer and read it into that during the
transition.
