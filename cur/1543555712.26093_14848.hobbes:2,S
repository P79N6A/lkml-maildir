You code handles far worse already, plus getting rid of all the
extra junk will make word wrapping far less common.
Robust tools don't fail just because the data isn't in one of 42
different hard-coded formats, and don't fail because of word-wrap.

So use a different marker... those users with IKD are quite a bit
more likely to have a serial console anyway, so it matters little.
The current over-size format would be fine.

You are guilty of causing data loss via scrolling, and you know it.
It is not good that your choice of regular expressions should dictate
that we get stuck with oopses that don't fit on the standard screen.

I didn't have much trouble, even while keeping it somewhat readable.
The actual data is worth much more than register names that are
exactly the same for every oops, so it is obvious what to chop out.

If the standard ARM console can hold 82x47 then that is OK.
If nearly all ARM systems are embedded devices with a serial
console, then again there is no problem. If VGA is common,
then this is a bug.

Oh yes I can merge them, using a '/' as a separator. There are plenty
of other options... but isn't the SPARC console usually 128-wide anyway?

The 80x25 screen really must work. Normal users don't have serial
consoles, JTAG connections, ROM-based debuggers, or anything else
reliable that can be used to capture a crash message.
