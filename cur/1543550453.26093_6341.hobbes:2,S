Ok, thanks.  I'll check it out.

The communication would be like an ioctl, but to me, ioctls are something that
processes send to drivers, not something that drivers send to other drivers.  I
just wanted to know if sending an ioctl from one driver to another was common,
and if not, what the alternative is.  
For example, under OS/2, drivers communicate amongst themselves by something
known as an IDC.  There is a kernel API for getting the IDC entry point of
another driver, which is really nothing more than a pointer.  The calling
driver just sets up his stack and/or registers, and just makes a call to the
IDC entry point as if it were a normal function.  There is no kernel
involvement in this call, and so the calling convention, etc is completely
defined by the callee.
