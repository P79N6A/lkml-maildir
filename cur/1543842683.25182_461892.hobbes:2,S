Is this always device specific, or also driver global information? Is
pktcdvd always on a block device? Maybe you just want them to be a group
of attributes in the block device directory where they belong to, like:
  /sys/block/sr0/pktcdvd/info
  /sys/block/sr0/pktcdvd/write_queue_size
  /sys/block/sr0/pktcdvd/...
Does that make sense? We should avoid messing around with symlinks
pointing to other devices, if not absolutely needed. We should also not
create a new device type, just for adding properties to an existing one,
especially if there is not some kind of "device stacking". The
"mapped_to" link to the parent device looks like a wild hack to me, we
should avoid.
Thanks,
Kay
