So, here is the ipc_lock_by_ptr() status:
1) do_msgsnd(), semctl_main(GETALL), semctl_main(SETALL) and find_undo() 
call it inside a refcounting.
   ==> no rcu read section needed.
2) *_exit_ns(), ipc_findkey() and sysvipc_find_ipc() call it under the 
ipc_ids mutex lock.
   ==> no rcu read section needed.
3) do_msgrcv() is the only path where ipc_lock_by_ptr() is not called 
under refcounting
   ==> rcu read section + some more checks needed once the spnlock is
       taken.
So I completely agree with you: we might remove the rcu_read_lock() from 
the ipc_lock_by_ptr() and explicitley  call it when needed (actually, it 
is already explicitly called in do_msgrcv()).
