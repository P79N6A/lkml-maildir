In general, Jouni's points are good, as are Michael's.
The key question is about the size of the SoftMAC code.  If its huge, an 
ieee80211 sub-module makes sense.  If it's not, then adding the code to 
net/ieee80211 makes a lot more sense.
Certainly some chips will use more ieee80211 code than others.  This is 
no different than ethernet NICs:  some make use of TSO and checksum 
offload code included in every kernel, while for other NICs the kernel 
TSO/csum code is just dead weight.
In general, adding directly to net/ieee80211 is preferred, UNLESS there 
are overriding reasons not to do so (such as a huge size increase).
