Hi Daniel,
I see that your patch was already merged, but I would like to reply
anyway.

Oops, good catch, thanks. I'm quite ashamed for letting this go
through :(

This is weird, and would certainly deserve additional investigation.
Disabling the PCI device when we no more need it is the right thing to
do and almost all pci drivers do that by now - except I2C bus drivers,
this is the first one I was attempting to convert.
Do you have any idea why disabling the SMBus causes the problem you
observe? Could be that your BIOS attempts to use the SMBus at power
down time, but I wonder what for. Do you have anything special on this
SMBus? Proprietary EEPROM? Real-time clock? I have two laptops using
this driver (one Sony, one Dell) and none exhibited the problem you
described.

Another bug I let go through :( Thanks again.
