I think you are wrong. __wake_up_common() calls wait_queue_t().func,
which is wake_bit_function(). It casts wait argument to wait_bit_queue,
and checks test_bit(wait_bit->bit_nr, wait_bit->flags) in _waker_
context, and wakes up wait->task _only_ if that bit is cleared,
so there is no false wakeups.
