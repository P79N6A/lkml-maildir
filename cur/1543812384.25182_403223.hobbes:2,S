I'm not particularly worried from the will-it-break-the-kernel POV.  Any
remaining problems will affect a relatively small number of machines and
once the proverbial million monkeys start running it, things will be shaken
out of the current x86 implementation.
So we can do this, but the question is do we _want_ to do it?  If the arch
maintainers can look at it from a high level and say "yup, I can use that
and it'll improve/simplify/speedup/reduce my code" then yes, it's worth
making the effort.
It's a hard one.
