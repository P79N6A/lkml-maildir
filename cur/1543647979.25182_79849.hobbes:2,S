What is so unusual in dealing with file descriptors in ioctl ?
Anyway, that ioctl takes file descriptor, finds struct socket and starts 
kernel
thread, struct socket is then used in that kernel thread 
(sock->ops->sendmsg, etc).
Take a look in net/bluetooth/bnep/sock.c:bnep_sock_ioctl() if you're 
interested.
