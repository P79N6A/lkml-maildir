Think again.
You're aging them both in try_to_swap_out() /and/ in
shrink_mmap().

No. I'm saying shared pages should have the accessed bits
propagated and be only aged once. I know we can't handle
this right for 2.4, but for 2.5 I hope to use physical-page
based page aging to get this one right...

This is /not/ the case. Think of a page from libc, which
is mapped by 30 processes. Now imagine that page is being
heavily used and was used by 5 processes since we scanned
it the last time.
With your patch we'd age the page down 25 (!!) times and
only age it up 5 times. This is clearly not what you want
for a page which was used by 5 different processes since
the last time we scanned it...
regards,
Rik
