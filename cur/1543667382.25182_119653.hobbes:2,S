Uh? Are you using Rusty's latest 2.5.x modutils? If so, 
/etc/modules.conf has been superseded by /etc/modprobe.conf. 
Take a look at modutils configuration and extra utils, as there is 
a tools used to automatically migrate from modules.conf to 
modprobe.conf. 
 
I haven't had problems wirh module aliases. For example, 
iso9660 is called isofs in 2.5, so I set up an alias for this 
module.
