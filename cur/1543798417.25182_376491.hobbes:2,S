Subject: [patch] ioctl BLKGETSIZE64 fix

Hello,
Two years ago, "[PATCH] use size_t for the broken ioctl numbers" brought in the problem.
<
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/7/14>
 (also FYI: <
https://lwn.net/Articles/48360/>
)
The patch below fixes the bug on BLKGETSIZE64. typeof(size_t) == 32, but we expect 64. 
The choice of `size_t' is also a mistake. We should have taken `int'.  This also affects
userland linux-kernel-headers.
Or am I missing something? Thanks.
