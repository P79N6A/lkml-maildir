Not sure. Although '--help' and '--version' act as exceptions, they
also create a rule: every program must identify itself and provide
some help. After all we are not talking about spiffy copyright string
here. I think the advantage of making UNIX more user friendly is well
worth it.
Of course, this will definitely break some pereverted script that
calls 'true' with the arguments above. :-)
