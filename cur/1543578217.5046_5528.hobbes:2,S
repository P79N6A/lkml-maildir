I haven't tracked the IP storage group too closely, but was at the San Diego IETF
where there were some interesting debates about this issue. 
There is a write-up at 
http://ips.pdl.cs.cmu.edu/mail/msg02598.html
Now I'm not sure if I agree with some of the assumptions. And I share your concern 
about using multiple tcp streams.
Thoughts?
cheers,
