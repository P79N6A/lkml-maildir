Thanks for this.
A couple of questions and comments:
 1/ Do you have any stats showing what sort of speedup this gives -
    I'm curious.
 2/ Was there a particular reason that you didn't use the
      include/linux/list.h
    list structures for the hash and lru chains?  If not, I suggest
    that doing so would be a good idea.  It should make the code
    clearer and more in-keeping with other code in the kernel.
 3/ It is easiest for (many of) us if you just include the patch
    in-line in your email messages rather than as an attachment.   You
    can then be sure that EVERY mail reader can display it
    effectively, and Linus has said a number of times that he doesn't
    like attachments.
 3a/ If you or your mailer insists on using attachments, please make
    sure that the mime-type of the attachment is correct - text/plain,
    not applications/x-unknown.  Again, that makes it a lot easier to
    read your patch.
 4/ I doubt that this is significant enough to go in before 2.4.0-final now,
    but it probably has a reasonable chance of getting in shortly
    afterwards.
