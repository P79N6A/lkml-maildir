                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^
Please disregard the second half of that sentence; when I ran blockdev --getsz,
I had deleted my loop device already. The device size still reads 20002 sectors
in 2.6. This doesn't change anything though, since the last two sectors of the
device, or the first two sectors of the last block, are still usable in 2.6 and
not in 2.4.
