Yes, yes it does.  It does a lot of similar things though.  My patch
does not take advantage of the DECLARE_PER_CPU macros, etc.  But it also 
offers node-topology info and per-node meminfo.  I'd like to see them 
work together.  Most of the conflict is simply in where we put the 
driverfs CPU code.  Your patch moves it (w/ additions) to kernel/cpu.c, 
whereas mine moves it (also w/ different additions) to 
drivers/base/cpu.c.  I think that the drivers/base is a bit more 
appropriate for the driverfs specific code (struct device_driver 
cpu_driver, the array of cpu_devices...).  Also, I made the registration 
routines arch-specific, because I figured that different architectures 
may want to add arch-specific info, and register devices at different 
times, in different orders, etc.  I also didn't incorporate the 
cpu_notifier stuff, which I should have.
What do you think of my patch (other than the obvious that it conflicts 
with yours)?
Cheers!
