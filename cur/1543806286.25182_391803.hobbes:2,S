With the 2.6.15 kernel, udevstart is no longer needed.  Please use the
recommended shell script instead (as posted to the linux-hotplug-devel

All of which are not patches included in the mainline kernel.  Can you
try it without these?

Again, don't do that :)
Also, udev specific questions like these are best asked on the
linux-hotplug-devel mailing list, as the udev documentation states.
