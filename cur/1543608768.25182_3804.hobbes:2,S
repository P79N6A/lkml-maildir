The stack is no longer aligned. We allocate two pages and disturb the stack
by upto 1.5K. We slab the task structs.

It may be. Likewise its not clear if %cr2 should hold current or a cpu ident
pointer (so you dont reload on switch of task). This needs more
benchmarking. Its in current -ac to verify the theory is correct not the
tuning.
