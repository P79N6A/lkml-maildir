What version of e2fsprogs do you have installed, and can you dig up
the exact error message at mount time?  It should be in the your
system logs....

Sounds like the root inode got zapped.  As for why, it's hard to say.
It could be a simple disk failure that happend as bad luck.  I haven't
seen any other bug reports that report corruption similar to yours, so
without a lot more information or a way to reproduce the error,
there's not much more I can say.
