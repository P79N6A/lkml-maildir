Oh, yes.  It is completely an option -- although I would like to see it
be the norm :)

Right, actually I agree with you.  That was my point about using SMP
lock points.  Since it uses the existing structure for SMP concurrency,
the patch is small -- but its effects are pretty large.  Its a fairly
big deal.

No, but I had to take that approach as it was suggested the patch be
merged for 2.4.10!
I am glad you take a pro side to the preemption issue.  Hopefully I can
get some continued support and see some work towards inclusion in 2.5. 
Any help is appreciated.
Sorry for the confusion.
