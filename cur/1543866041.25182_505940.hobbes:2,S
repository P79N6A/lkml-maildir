Every submit.  But it's all against one or two file descriptors.  So, if
you return to userspace, they have to walk all 1000 async_results every
time, just to see which completed and which didn't.  And *then* go wait
for the ones that didn't.  If they just wait for them all, they aren't
spinning cpu on the -EASYNC operations.
	I'm not saying that "don't return a completion if we can
non-block it" is inherently wrong or not a good idea.  I'm saying that
we need a way to flag them efficiently.
