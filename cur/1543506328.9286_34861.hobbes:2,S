Use kiobufs --- that's what they are there for.  Look at the way the raw
IO code works when doing IO to existing user addresses: it creates a
kiobuf and does a map_user_kiobuf() to map the user's virtual address
range into the kiobuf.  You can then do any processing you want on the
kiobuf using plain, pinned, normal, clean kernel virtual addresses.
