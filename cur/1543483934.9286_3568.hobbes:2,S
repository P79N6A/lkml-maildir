Hi Fred,

so therefore all the previous arguments about how this new way of
doing things is semantically correct are invalid. So we'll need a
new semantic won't we?
  It seems that people who have problems with the automatic creation of a
  route are all using point to point interfaces, no?  If that's the case,
  can't the implementation be changed so that for point to point interfaces an
  automatic route is not added, but for broadcast interfaces it is?  That
  seems to be the way most others implement it.
So we're going to go from:
	userspace adds interface
	userspace adds route
(which is all taken care of in simple scripts)
to the new way:
	userspace adds interface
	kernel decides whether it's a regular
	broadcast interface, or something_else.
		case broadcast
			add the typical route
		case something_else_1
			........
		   .
		   .
		case something_else_N
			.......
	
	if kernel didn't know about our unusual setup
		userspace delete/modify/add route
(possibly taken care of by complicated scripts - but i'm sure
someone can come up with a setup that works the old way and not
the new way)
 
and all in the name of being "semantically correct"? 
I think the former way of doing things is far more "correct",
straightforward and flexible.
  Fred
  
regards,
Paul.
