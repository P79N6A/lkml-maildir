There is a log-structured filesystem for Linux, it's called dtfs and is
available at 
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/czezatke/lfs.html.
 I
mailed the author and he said he was shooting for inclusion in Linux
2.3.
From what I understand, the project is fairly far along and in a usable
state although I'm sure he wouldn't mind some help from a few additional
developers.
