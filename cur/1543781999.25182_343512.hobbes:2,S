Hello everybody,
seems like I have a problem with PCMCIA/PCCARD. If I transfer data to or from 
a CF card inserted via adapter system waits for interrupts most of the time:
Cpu(s): 21.2% us,  7.9% sy,  0.0% ni,  0.0% id,  1.7% wa, 69.2% hi,  0.0% si
This results in a very unresponsive system and a transfer rate of up to 1MB/s 
(my new camera writes with up to 10MB/s on the card...).
Any idea what could be the reason? This is with 2.6.12/pcmcia-cs and with 
2.6.13-rc*/pcmciautils. The CF card is a Lexar 1GB.
