So it's definite that all three UHCI controllers use IRQ 21.

I'm not aware under what circumstances the EHCI controller generates 
interrupt requests upon plugging in a new device, but apparently it did so 
for you.  Maybe because there were no other devices plugged in and the 
controller was suspended.
Clearly the EHCI controller also uses IRQ 21, even though the system 
thinks it is mapped to a different IRQ.

This is an artifact of the way the system detects and reports unhandled 
IRQs.

Probably.

Do you really mean "modprobe ehci-hcd" here?  So the EHCI driver was
loaded and not the UHCI driver?  Or was that a typo?

With no UHCI driver?

But you had just previously loaded ehci-hcd.  Unless the earlier line was 
a typo.

It seems quite clear that the EHCI controller's IRQ line is causing the
problems.  Just out of curiousity, what happens if you really do remove
the UHCI driver, keeping only the EHCI driver, and then plug in the mouse?  
Off hand I would expect nothing much to happen -- maybe a line or two in
the system log, no change to the IRQ counters, and the mouse doesn't work
(not even erratically).
