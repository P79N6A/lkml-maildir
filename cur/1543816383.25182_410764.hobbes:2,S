So perhaps could we define an informal subset of the kernel code that  
works in both userspace and kernel-space and put it in include/libk?   
Stuff like linked lists, spinlocks (depends on arch, may not be  
supported), etc could be in linux/libk and linux/include/libk or  
similar, and then from there included into linux/include/linux/ 
list.h, etc, as well as into the UML files that need it.  Since the  
provider and user would both be the Linux kernel, I see no issues  
with trying to provide a stable interface of any kind, especially if  
we document it as "PRIVATE - FOR KERNEL USE ONLY!!!" with big warning  
signs. As a nice bonus, this would make it possible to implement some  
user-space unit tests of various pieces.
Cheers,
