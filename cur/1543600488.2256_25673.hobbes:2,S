The final version evoked a compile-time error instead of BUG(), and
also was more careful about the kind of zero it compares with! Linus
okayed it in principle and "real life" tests showed that it works
and catches what it's supposed to catch. For me it turned up one
kernel report (in tun.c) and three more in the xfs patches. The
trial covered about a quarter of the kernel.
Some people spotted that the error case can probably be reduced to
large signed versus small unsigned, both of size at least int.

I don't know. I intended only to turn the sign bit on. I'm not sure how
1's complement arithmetic works, so I don't know if it works for 1's
complement arithmetic.

When someone states what the problem is exactly, and what portion
of it they want to test for, then the test can be modified to suit.
I intended to show that the test can be performed and a two
arg min thereby retained.

Probably!
