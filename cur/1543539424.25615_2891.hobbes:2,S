And what about video cards?  You can easily program the clocks to a value that
is likely to destroy or damage your monitor.  Intelligent monitors handle this.
Old ones get smokey.  If the hardware allows destructive commands to destroy it,
you need to support a different manufacturer.
Notwithstanding, I'm sure there's a lot of other hardware that allows you to
destroy it.  How much effort should be spent to ensure such silliness isn't
allowed?
After watching this thread for a while, I have to stand against adding code.
Perhaps I don't understand precisely what Andre is attending to, but I get the
gist of it.  If it's something that can be patched up...well...do it and we'll
all go on happily with a new kernel version not even knowing or caring that
something changed.  If it can't be fixed, why waste time running around in
circles?
