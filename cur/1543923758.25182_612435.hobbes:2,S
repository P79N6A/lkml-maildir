We have a few bits of code in there to look at the actual MMCONFIG base 
register, which is good since we can sanity check it against the 
firmware.  However, by itself it's not enough since we may end up using 
it even though the BIOS didn't tell us about an overlap that really 
does exist.  Robert recognized this and added checks to make sure the 
values read from the base regs actually matched what the firmware was 
telling us in the ACPI tables (at least iirc, it's been awhile since I 
looked at the patch).
So don't be too nervous. :)
