Some time ago I posted these patches: 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/task_patches/
They basically only move the type definitions into separate header files, 
but would basically allow a much better cleanup of e.g. the spinlock 
header file. Right now it's an ifdef jungle with lots of duplicated code.
In the end I'd like to see a single set of spinlock functions, which are 
either inlined or instantiated in kernel/spinlock.c. But for the macros to 
become inline functions, we need to cleanup the header dependencies, so 
that we get: spinlock implementation -> preempt/irq implementation -> 
task/thread definitions -> spinlock definitions.
In this context I'm a little concerned whether your up/smp separation 
really works out. A proper cleanup needs changes outside the spinlock 
code and not just splitting the existing header into smaller headers.
bye, Roman
