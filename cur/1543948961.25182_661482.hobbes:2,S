It of course lays waste to a series of cgroup patches from Paul Menage
which I already had queued.
So I shall drop git-sched again.
How often do I have to say this?  git-sched is not
git-everything-which-looks-shiny!  It is for the CPU scheduler.
If you had put this patchset into a private branch for private testing, or
even into a separate git-petes-stuff then I wouldn't have to collaterally
drop the entirety of git-sched because of this.
Sigh.
