That might be nice. OTOH it is just a random suggestion from me. I don't
know what core fs developers think about requiring fuse and user code to
mount these old things...
Would we have to distribute the user code with the kernel? I guess then
we would still need to maintain it, but I guess the key improvement would
be that fuse APIs are very stable.
