Most cheap bt8xx boards don't have eeprom or other means for properly
detecting the board internals. For such boards, you need to specify
card=<nr>, otherwise the driver will use a generic "default" that may
not work.
The proper way for handling this is by adding at /etc/modprobe.conf
(or /etc/modules, depending on your distro) a line like:
options bttv card=<nr>
This way, every time the module will load, the modprobe tools will use
the proper options.
If your board have an unique PCI ID, we may add it to the driver,
avoiding this need. For this, we will need the results of the following
command:
lspci -vv -nn
Cheers,
Mauro
