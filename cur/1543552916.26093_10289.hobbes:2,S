Alan,
I don't know what all changes you guys did to 2.2.18pre, but the LAN I/O
performance absolutely rocks on our tests here vs. NetWare.  Good job. 
It's still got some problems with NFS (I am seeing a few RPC timeout
errors) so I am backreving to 2.2.17 for the Ute-NWFS release next week,
but it's most impressive.
:-)
Jeff
