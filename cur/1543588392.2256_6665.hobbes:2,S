Addendum to 1. So far everyone (at least on LKML) who has had the
crash-immediatly-do-not-pass-go issues has been using an iwill kk266 (or
kk266r, IIRC) mobo.
Have we gotten any fix, other than not using K7 optimizations?
I'm willing to keep trying new patches, if necessary.  (And for that
matter, the box is on dialup behind masq, but if you are interested I can
set up an account.  No serial console, no remote power cycle, so I'm not
sure how much good it'll do, but it's an option if you want/need it.)
