Hi
yesterday I tested our USB stuff on a VIA MVP3 Motherboard, 64Mbyte
SDRAM (8ns), K6-II 400 (see pci.txt for further details). The machine is
equipped with a 2nd USB controller as PCI card (VIA cipset too). I am
running linux 2.3.37.
Everthing worked ok until I enabled DMA operation for the harddisk
(primary master, FUJITSU MPB3043ATU) (see via.txt for furthe details).
Whenever the harddisk is accessed the USB controller produces data
buffer errors which are described in the UHCI specification: 
Data Buffer Error. Set to a 1 by the Host Controller during status
update to indicate that the
Host Controller is unable to keep up with the reception of incoming data
(overrun) or is unable
to supply data fast enough during transmission (underrun). When this
occurs, the actual
length and Max Length field of the TD will not match. In the case of an
underrun, the Host
Controller will transmit an incorrect CRC (thus invalidating the data at
the endpoint) and leave
the TD active (unless error count reached zero). If a overrun condition
occurs, the Host
Controller will force a timeout condition on the USB, invalidating the
transaction at the source.
In my case the reading of an isochronous data stream produced overruns -
i.e. the USB controller was not able to transfer its fifo contents fast
enough to the system memory. It does not make any difference if the
internal USB controller or the PCI card is used. The problem is not
spurious - it happens all the time and if I am increasing the transfers
by a ´find /´ the kernel log is flooded with error messages.
My conclusion is that there might be a problem with the chipset settings
which causes these massive errors. On intel boards (TX, BX tested) this
error happens once in a week or less.
Further I noticed that 4 IDE devices (tested with 4 IBM DHEA 6.4Gbyte
drives) operating in DMA mode produce ext2 filesystem errors.
I was testing on two VIA MVP3 motherboards: a 1,5 year old one and a
brand new one. The chipset revisions were slightly different but the
problems were the same.
Has anybody else experienced such massive problems with those
motherboards? Is there a solution for the problems?
