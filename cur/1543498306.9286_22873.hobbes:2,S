> I'd give NFSv2 another 30 years. I believe NFSv4 draft is also 32bit
NFSv2 has a 32-bit rdev field.
NFSv3 has a 64-bit rdev field, split 32+32.

[By the way, if I am not mistaken, this NFS point is really very minor.
I cannot see how it matters in the choice between 32 and 64.
In my representation (32+32 unless 16+16 unless 8+8) it would mean
that 32+32 device nodes can only be exported over NFSv3.
If we change to 64-bit immediately, but leave the high order half
zero at first then all is fine. When people need more than 32 bits
they'll also have to upgrade to NFSv3. Reasonable enough.]
