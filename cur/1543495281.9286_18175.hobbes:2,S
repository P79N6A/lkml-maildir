First let me say relying on the value of timeout in any way
can be hazardous to your health; it't extremele non-portable.
With that said, if timeout returns > 0 and it's a linux
system, timeout will contain the time left before the call
would have timed out, otherwise it's pretty much undefined,
so don't expect it to be anything :)
