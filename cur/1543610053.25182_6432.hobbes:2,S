Running 2.4.15pre5 (UP) on i386, running UML 2.4.14-2.
UML processes create threads on the host system that don't
die.  Threads are stuck at do_exit( ), so I backed out the
patch to kernel/exit.c @ 539 (in 2.4.15pre5 patch):
  p->state = TASK_DEAD;
and things work fine.  I do not see zombies with anything
other than UML processes/native threads.
