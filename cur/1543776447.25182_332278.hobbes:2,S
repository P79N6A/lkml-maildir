Then you watch the directory /etc/ which would have caught all of this,
right?  My argument is that wouldn't inotify also want to know this
exact same thing?

Great, so your userspace notification is different than inotify, that's
fine.  But what you are trying to do within the kernel is pretty much
the same, which is my main point.

Fine, inotify users can just ignore those messages.  Or perhaps they
will grow to want to see them.

Why is this not a good goal for inotify to also have?

Ok, a difference.

And those "security requirements" are what?

Again, not a big deal for inotify.

Again, something that I think inotify would like to also know.

Sure, just because you all do some things differently, doesn't mean that
you shouldn't use the same core code.
Now I know you don't want to worry about another project's code getting
into the kernel tree to depend on your changes, but hey, that's life.
Try working with the inotify developers instead of ignoring them and
duplicating the same stuff.
Also, you still have not pointed out what auditfs is for and how to use
it.
