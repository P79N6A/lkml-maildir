Apologies I misread your bug report.  Maybe this will be of more help.

That does seem odd, I haven't noticed this with vanilla 2.6.0test3
(linux only, but a reboot linux->linux would exhibit that).
I note on the non synaptics boot you have this instead of the synaptics.
serio: i8042 AUX3 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
It may be worth #define DEBUG in i8042.c, to see the differences between
the two boot sequences in more detail.
You might want to try against 2.6.0-test3, if it works for you
then it might be worth going through the synaptics patches in mm2 one by
one :(

I'll see if I can replicate this with my laptop this evening.
