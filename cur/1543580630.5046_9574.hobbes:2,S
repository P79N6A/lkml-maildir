The state is required, not optional, if we are to have a decent basis for
building asyncronous io into the kernel.

I'm still not seeing what I consider valid arguments from the networking
people regarding the use of kiobufs as the interface they present to the
VFS for asynchronous/bulk io.  I agree with their needs for a light weight
mechanism for getting small io requests from userland, and even the need
for using lightweight scatter gather lists within the network layer
itself.  If the statement is that map_user_kiobuf is too heavy for use on
every single io, sure.  But that is a seperate issue.
