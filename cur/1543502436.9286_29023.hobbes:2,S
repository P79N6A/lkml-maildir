Yuck, triple yuck! 
Now, may I propose that someone who knows the ins and outs of the new 
fs stuff does the required surgery to produce "clean" non-translating 
FAT support? Whether we like it or not, for some poor people DOS floppies 
are likely to be the only "reasonable" way to transport "large" (ahem) 
files between home and the office. Never mind the translation, but at
least get the channel working again. And then simply forget about the 
translation for ever after... 
Keep up the good work,
MCE
