I'm not actually talking about subsequent syscalls issued by the kernel.
I'm talking about stuff like init, bash, and the module tools.  If
any of these call any of the affected syscalls which expect user
registers to be at the top of the kernel stack, they'll be accessing
the wrong data.  A corrected comment would be:
 	The only limitation of force_successful_syscall_return() is
 	that it doesn't help with system calls performed by the
 	kernel or user threads exec'd from the kernel.
I'd suggest such a comment is added to force_successful_syscall_return()
to ensure that anyone thinking it'll work for all user space processes
is sufficiently deterred.

Oh, I'm currently not thinking about implementing this on ARM; this
touches a similar area which I investigated a number of months ago.
I through out the idea of accessing user registers for user space
programs at the top of the kernel stack because it does not work for
processes exec'd from kernel space.
