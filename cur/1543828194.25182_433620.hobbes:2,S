The new name is confusing because __cache_alloc_cpucache suggests that we 
are only allocating from the cpucache and that this be something special. 
However, we always allocate from the cpucache for local allocations and we 
refill the cpucache in the __cpucache function from the shared cache and 
the per node lists. So we do much more there.
Maybe call this __cache_alloc_local ?
