"We'd need all of C++, or nothing" is a bogus argument.  It's perfectly
reasonable to want to use a subset of C++, since C++ is such an
all-inclusive language.  At my last systems programming job (at
Geoworks) we had a whole graphical embedded OS implemented in C++ and had
basically no bloat or performance problems (and it had one of the only
Java implementations I've seen that didn't suck performance-wise :-).
The problems we ran into were almost always related to crappy C++
support in embedded compilers; it was always nice when we got to use g++.
Of course, 2/3 of our coding conventions were made up of "don't use X
feature of C++", where some values of X were "templates" and "exceptions".
Even (especially) with that stuff removed, you get a reasonably
straightforward language for systems programming.  Of course, we also
shipped OS + apps as a single, statically linked image (appropriate for
a cell phone w/ no MMU), so we also didn't have to deal with the binary
compatibility problems that C++ frequently brings.
