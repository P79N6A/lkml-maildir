There can be situations where we won't be waiting on this IO at all. 
Network zero-copy transmit, for example.
Or maybe there's some async writeback going on against pagecache - we'll
end up looking at the page's LRU state within interrupt context at IO
completion.  (A sync would prevent this from happening).
One possibly problematic scenario is where task A is doing a direct-IO read
and task B truncates the same file - here, the page will be actually
removed from the LRU and freed in interrupt context.  The direct-IO read
process will be waiting on the IO in D state though.  It it was a
synchronous read - if it was an AIO read then it won't be waiting on the
IO.  Something else might save us here, but it's fragile.

hm.  It's all a bit of a worry.  I don't understand what swsusp is trying
to do here sufficiently well to be able to advise, sorry.  I was rather
surprised to learn that it's presently taking copies of all these pages...
