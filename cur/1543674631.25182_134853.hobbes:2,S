Same for me...

I installed 2.4.19 (because I know it's stable - at least for me) yesterday on
my machine and no it runs stable again (it seems, because it's now up for more
than 15 hours). With 2.4.21-rc[1,2], I never had such a long uptime. :-)

OK. So now I have to say: _Don't_ use 2.4.20-rc* if you have a aic7xxx. You can
use 2.4.19 and maybe 2.4.20(?).
Best regards,
 Oliver
