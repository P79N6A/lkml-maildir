Ehhh, Linus, Linearly reading my harddisk goes at 26Mb per second. By
analyzing my boot process I determine that 50M of my disk is used
during boot. I can then reshuffle my disk to have that 50M of data at
the beginning and reading all that into 50M of cache, I can save
thousands of 10ms seeks. Boot time would go from several tens of
seconds to 2 seconds worth of DISK IO plus several seconds of pure CPU
time.
This doesn't work if I don't have the memory to cache 50M of
disk-blocks.
Is this simply: Don't try this then? 
				Roger.
