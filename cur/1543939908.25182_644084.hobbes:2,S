While it is probably reasonable to put the kgdb options into a sub
entry,  you cannot get rid of the "Method for KGDB communication"
choice, unless you re-implement it another way.
It is designed to implement the following:
1) You can chose to build 1 and only 1 KGDB I/O module into the kernel
2) Or you select modules only and can you can build as many additional
    KGDB I/O modules as you like.
3) Additional I/O modules can be built and you can load one at run time
    if you want to use another I/O method vs #1
KGDB's Kconfig options are designed to allow you to have alternate ways
to select static or run time configuration of the I/O connection to the
KGDB core, IE: over serial, over ethernet, over USB or what ever module
you would like to implement.
