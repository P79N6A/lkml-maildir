Well don't you just sum up the maximum for each process?
Or do you want to only count shared pages inside a container once,
or something difficult like that?

So what are you going to do about all the shared caches and slabs
inside the kernel?

Well rmap only supports mapped, userspace pages.

Yeah it is not perfect. Fortunately, there is no perfect solution,
so we don't have to be too upset about that.
And strangely, this example does not go outside the parameters of
what you asked for AFAIKS. In the worst case of one container getting
_all_ the shared pages, they will still remain inside their maximum
rss limit.
So they might get penalised a bit on reclaim, but maximum rss limits
will work fine, and you can (almost) guarantee X amount of memory for
a given container, and it will _work_.
But I also take back my comments about this being the only design I
have seen that gets everything, because the node-per-container idea
is a really good one on the surface. And it could mean even less impact
on the core VM than this patch. That is also a first-touch scheme.

I think it is simplistic.
Sure you could probably use some of the rmap stuff to account shared
mapped _user_ pages once for each container that touches them. And
this patchset isn't preventing that.
But how do you account kernel allocations? How do you account unmapped
pagecache?
What's the big deal so many accounting people have with just RSS? I'm
not a container person, this is an honest question. Because from my
POV if you conveniently ignore everything else... you may as well just
not do any accounting at all.
