Subject: include/asm-sparc/ptrace.h is broken

on line 76, it includes <asm/asm_offsets.h>, which does not exist.
This is critical because this include file does not work when used from
a libc.  ptrace.h is from 1997 on my 2.4.5 kernel, so this is not
something that broke recently.
My suggestion is to remove the offending line altogether or at least
protect it with #ifdef __KERNEL__.
