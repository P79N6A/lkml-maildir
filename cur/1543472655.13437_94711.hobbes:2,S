Of course this is not a case :-) At least for last four years ...

Hm. Looks like not all you statements are lie. This is correct.

This is not so relevant for swap partition as well :-))

Not, of course.

You are joking ??? Gosh. Why you are permanently wrote something to show your
incompetency ? Of course this absolutely not a case. Do you ever read
`man mkswap` ? This is from there:

       To  setup a swap file, it is necessary to create that file
       before running mkswap .  A sequence of commands similar to
       the following is reasonable for this purpose:
              # dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1024 count=8192
              # mkswap swapfile 8192
              # sync
              # swapon swapfile
       Note  that  a  swap  file  must not contain any holes (so,
       using cp(1) to create the file is not acceptable).
-- cut --
I'm does not have swap partition here at all (this was BIG problem while
setting up RedHat 5.1 -- I was REALLY mad when found that I'm could not setup
RedHat 5.1 without swap partition like RedHat 4.x or RedHat 5.0 @##%^$%$^#$@).
Instead I'm have commands
-- cut --
mkswap /dos/d-w95/windows/win386.swp
sync
swapon /dos/d-w95/windows/win386.swp
-- cut --
This way I'm could use the same swap file in Linux and Windows 98 :-) And of
course for last four years Linux was able to use swap file instead of swap
partition -- no problems with "block groups" or whatever. On FAT (including
FAT32 via VFAT as in example above :-), ext2fs, etc.
P.S. In fact there are problem with swap file: you should be able to mount
partition with swap file before use of this file ! This could be problem for
tiny computers with 2Mb RAM... But 2.1.1xx could not use them anyway...
