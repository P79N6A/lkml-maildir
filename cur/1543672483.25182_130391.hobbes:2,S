Thats not actually clear either. The kernel contains the clear syscall
message for good reasons. The GPL itself talks about stuff that comes
normally with the OS very carefully for similar reasons.
You see there isn't any difference between an interpreter hitting
	Java bytecode 145
and a function call of 
	perform_java_bytecode(145);
Indeed the JVM may turn one into the other.
If you think that is bad remember that the DMCA and other rulings have
held shrink wrap licenses can sometimes overrule US style "fair use", so
your JVM in JITting code may be making you liable for a license
violation for some applications.
