	Thanks for your response. What i meant was 
	every process could have an account of how
	many bytes were read/written to various
	filesystems/sockets using read()/write()
	system calls. 
	We could dump this stuff in /proc and
	it could tell us which processes are
	heavily IO bound.
	I am wondering if this information will
	be useful to anyone.
