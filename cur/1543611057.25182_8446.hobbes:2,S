   It would be even better to mention it in the kernel documentation,
   since iproute2 is fairly standard now.  I'm really not enough of a
   kernel hacker to change it, but the current Configure.help entry for
   CONFIG_NETLINK suggests that it is useful only for relatively
   obscure applications.
That is changing soon, the config options are in fact going away and
both will be on all the time if you have networking enabled at all.
