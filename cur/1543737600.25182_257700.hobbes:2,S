Hello,
It seems that make (possibly among other things) has been affected by
some change in 2.6.9-rcX that prevents it from resuming some jobs.
I created this Makefile as a testcase:
all:
	sleep 5
	echo Hi
	sleep 5
The result:
darjeeling:~{0}% make
sleep 5
zsh: suspended  make
darjeeling:~{1}% bg
[1]  + continued  make
make: *** wait: No child processes.  Stop.
make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
darjeeling:~{1}% echo Hi
Hi
make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
sleep 5
make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
[1]  + exit 2     make
This happens with bash also. I'm pretty sure it didn't use to happen
with older kernels. Any ideas?
Thanks
