Hey Steve,
  Understood, and agreed.  I only mentioned it because I wanted to clear
the record that I did not (to my knowledge) mess up the protocol design
which first introduced the get/put-task pattern under discussion ;).  I
am fairly confident that at least the -rt version does not have any race
conditions such as the one Linus mentioned in the mainline version.  I
am not advocating that the full protocol that we use in -rt should be
carried forward, per se or anything like that.
-Greg
