Sounds like the name of Jim Gray, the famous database and transaction
processing expert of IBM, Tandem, DEC and Microsoft.
Neither SGI nor XFS has had the honor of working with Jim Gray.
The original XFS developers and designers include Geoff Peck, Jeff
Glover, Adam Sweeney and Doug Doucette, from what I can see from my
notes dating back to 1993/1994 on this.
