Thats not entirely accurate, or fair. A packet filter is a type of
Firewall (or can be). A Firewall is a means to implement a security
policy, usually specifically a network access policy. A Packet Filter,
including a ""Linux based" firewall" is a perfectly acceptable means of
achieving that goal, if it meets the policy requirements.

 (over 7 years
old, but still highly relevant).
Most commercial firewalls are very bad at protecting servers offering
Internet services, they aren't designed to do it.
