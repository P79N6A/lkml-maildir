Then that shouldn't use a mutex. A mutex is for "mutual exclusion", and
not "shared exclusion".  Peter is right that the fundamental property of
a mutex, is that it is for a single thread.  And it should never be
released by a separate thread than the one that grabbed it.
A semaphore can be used as a mutex, but not the other way around.
I wouldn't even recommend doing the mutex_pass_owner().  To do so, the
process calling this must be the owner, and the parameter must be a
thread waiting on the mutex. If it is not, then that could introduce
some really nasty races and bugs.
The mutex_unlock_dont_warn_if_a_different_task_did_it() is also a bad
idea.
