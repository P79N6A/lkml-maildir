We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.16.7 kernel.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.16.6 and 2.6.16.7, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.16.y git tree can be found at:
 	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.16.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
	www.kernel.org/git/
Note, there seems to be a bit of a discrepancy in the assigning of CVE
numbers to a specific issue that was solved in this release.  The
original author and I both asked for CVE numbers for different patches
and seem to have gotten the same one.  Please note that these are two
different issues, yet, the same CVE number.  Hopefully it gets fixed
eventually for those who like to track these kinds of things...
thanks,
greg k-h
