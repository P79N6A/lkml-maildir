HI,
I am just having an oops immediatelly at boot
with kernel 2.5.35.
I get a message saying
kernel BUG at sched.c: 944
eip code point to:
c0117810 T schedule
The process that caused the oops is "swapper".
Obviously syslogd was not running, so I had not a message
to pass trought ksymoops, but if you need, I can write the
oops by hand, and then use ksymoops.
This pc is a PIII 933 Mhz, with 512 MB RAM.
MotherBoard has an Intel 810 chipset.
Kernel had been compiled with gcc 3.2 and binutils 2.13.90.0.4.
Hope this helps
Luigi
