I used to run NTP but I thought I didn't do that when I epxerienced that clock 
drift. The Box (after a restart) is up for 1 day and 13 hours now, there is 
no clock drift any more...
...the xmms problem disappeared by recompileing the xmms-alsa plugin (which is 
strange for me), but it is gone...
the only thing left:
Debug: sleeping function called from invalid context at 
include/asm/uaccess.h:473
in_atomic():0, irqs_disabled():1
Call Trace:

... there are more of this called from different source files...
