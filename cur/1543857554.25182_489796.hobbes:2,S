I looked at implementing linear pagetable mappings for x86 as a way of
getting rid of CONFIG_HIGHPTE, and to make pagetable manipulations
generally more efficient.  I gave up on it after a while because all the
existing pagetable accessors are not suitable for a linear pagetable,
and I didn't want to have to introduce a pile of new pagetable
interfaces.  Would the PTI interface be helpful for this?
Thanks,
