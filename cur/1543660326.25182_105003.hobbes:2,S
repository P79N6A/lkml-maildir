hi,
I am trying to do kernel profile using kernprof with the patch provided by
SGI on 2.4.18. I can't find the 2.95.3 gcc patch that must be used to
compile the kernel( the info on sgi's web site somehow is broken).  Does
anybody know where the patch is ? or any alternative I can use, like
a more stable gcc version without the need for a patch?
thanks for your help
hui
