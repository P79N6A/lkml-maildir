hmmm, of course I meant "timerid" in that last line.

And you'd need similar for timer_settime() and, perhaps,
timer_getoverrun().  But it seems slightly ugly, in the same way that
my idea in option (d) of returning a file descriptor from
timer_create() seems a slightly ugly.  (And can we guarantee that
the [timerid] space is distinct from the [fd|POSIX_TIMER_FD] space?)
Cheers,
Michael
