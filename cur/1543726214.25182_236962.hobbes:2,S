As I understand it there will still be a place for the current hard-RT
Linux solutions, because even if I can get five nines latency better
than N, this is not good enough for hard RT, as you need to be able to
mathematically demonstrate that you can *never* miss a deadline.
Or are you saying that the latest developments in the stock kernel make
this possible?
