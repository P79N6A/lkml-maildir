great! Applied. The kgdb memory accesses look _much_ cleaner now, and 
it's a significant simplification as well:
   2 files changed, 109 insertions(+), 244 deletions(-)
the uaccess.h macros look a bit ugly now (it all got inherited from the 
existing [and ancient] probe_kernel_address() macro) and because we now 
touch it materially anyway, we might as well do it right?
