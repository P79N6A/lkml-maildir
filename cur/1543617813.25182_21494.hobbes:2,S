Subject: "make htmldocs" chokes on bug in DocBook template

This is close to trivial but anyway deserves to be fixed: "make htmldocs"
fails due to a bug in the template for deviceiobook.tmpl. In the last
chapter the file include/asm-i386/io.h is included which however does not
yet have any DocBook comments (2.4.18pre3). So this basically expands to
nothing and the SGML-parser seems to expect at least an empty paragraph
and complains about the unfinished chapter. Two easy fixes: Either take
this chapter out completely, or replace the include by an empty paragraph
or add some documentation in DocBook format to include/asm-i386/io.h.
(Second one is preferable, I guess.)
