Which compiler/binutils are you running over there?

weird.
There are no significant changes in processor.h relative to 2.6.22-rc1.
If the file-n-line aren't screwed up, it's disliking
#define BUG()								\
	do {								\
		asm volatile("1:\tud2\n"				\
			     ".pushsection __bug_table,\"a\"\n"		\
			     "2:\t.long 1b, %c0\n"			\
			     "\t.word %c1, 0\n"				\
			     "\t.org 2b+%c2\n"				\
			     ".popsection"				\
			     : : "i" (__FILE__), "i" (__LINE__),	\
			     "i" (sizeof(struct bug_entry)));		\
		for(;;) ;						\
	} while(0)
and we haven't changedanything in there recently either.

It built and ran 2.6.22-rc1-git4 happily.
