No I did mean the i_mutex since you take the i_mutex when you set
S_REVOKE_LOCK.  So between that and the comment above do_lookup(),
I assumed you were trying to lock out concurrent do_lookups() returning
an inode whose revoke is starting at the same time.
But based on your next paragraph it sounds like I misunderstand your
locking.

And a new reference means through iget(), so if revoke starts
between the IS_REVOKE_LOCKED() check in do_lookup and its return,
it's ok bc we'll get a reference later on?
I'm a little confused but i'll keep looking.
