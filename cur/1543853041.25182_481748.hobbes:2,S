/dev does not exist. How should it? The root filesystem / is empty, other
people can verify that, or you can verify it yourself with an
initramfs (which, unlike an initrd, is copied to / instead of being
mounted).
Yes, the kernel understands root=/dev/ but that's a hack, a strstr(s,
"/dev/"). Should you want to use, say, root=/devices/hda instead,
that would only succeed when using an initrd/initramfs.
To display the accepted block devices (this is most likely what you
really wanted), check out
ftp://ftp-1.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/suser-jengelh/kernel/linux-2.6.18-jen35/show_partitions.diff
Please (a) don't top post (b) don't strip Cc:s.
