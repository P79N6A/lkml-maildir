Just for clarification - it will be completely impossible to login using 
openssh or some other priveledge separation protocol to the machine due
to the nature of unix sockets. So you will be unable to manage your
storage system just because it is in OOM - it is not what is expected
from reliable system.

Just pure openssh for control connection (admin should be able to
login).
