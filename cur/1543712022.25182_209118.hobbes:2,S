Agreed.
Independent DM efforts have already started supporting MD raid0/1 
metadata from what I understand, though these efforts don't seem to post 
to linux-kernel or linux-raid much at all.  :/

I would be disappointed if all the work that has gone into the MD driver 
is simply obsoleted by new DM targets.  Particularly RAID 1/5/6.
You pretty much echoed my sentiments exactly...  ideally md and dm can 
be bound much more tightly to each other.  For example, convert md's 
raid[0156].c into device mapper targets...  but indeed, nobody has 
stepped up to do that so far.
