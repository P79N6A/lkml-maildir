A few months ago, I implemented preemptible kernel threads (locally;  I
tend to think the other patches are superior).  Part of the changes was
to separate schedule into __schedule() (common part), schedule_user()
(automatic schedule from entry.S) and schedule() (manual schedule in
kernel space);  besides making what Jamie proposed easier, we can also
save a few cycles in the (common) schedule_user case:
 - we never release the kernel lock
 - we can pass current to schedule_user
 - we just handled softirqs
this is 2.5 material though ...
