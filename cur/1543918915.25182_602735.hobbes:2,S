In fact mc config (ini) section is a better way.
I use default blue (which is very annoying) for root user, to be aware of
possible results. Otherwise i use black background:
[Colors]
color_terminals=linux,xterm
base_color=normal=lightgray,black:marked=magenta,black:executable=green,black:directory=lightgray,black:editnormal=green,black:editbold=red,black
The most exiting event recently was, that `lynx` in debian got updated, so
it displays much more colors for HTML formatting now. I'm happy.
