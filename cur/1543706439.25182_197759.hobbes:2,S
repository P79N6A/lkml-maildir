Well we really should be able to support values lower than 32 anyway - just
from a quality-of-code point of view.
I do recall once spying a piece of code which would cause a div-by-zero if
HZ was set to less than 50.  These things happen.

You should lose the ifdefs.  Just do:
	if (SHIFT_SCALE <= (SHIFT_USEC + SHIFT_HZ)) {
		if (ltemp < 0)
			time_adj -= -ltemp >>
				(SHIFT_USEC + SHIFT_HZ - SHIFT_SCALE);
		else
			time_adj += ltemp >>
				(SHIFT_USEC + SHIFT_HZ - SHIFT_SCALE);
	}
	...
because
a) It is not revolting and
b) The compiler checks the unused code for you, then throws it away.
