identifying problem areas is near 100% automatic if you look at -T5: all
illegal sleeps and illegal smp_processor_id() assumptions are reported
when they happen. That's how i identified & fixed the core 90 locks in
the first wave, in just a couple of hours. The only minor annoyance when
doing a conversion is the inflexibility of SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED and
RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED initializer. If it werent for the initializers then a
'conversion' would be a matter of a 2-line change, the change of the
prototype and the change of the definition. Now it's a 3-line change
most of the time - still very fast and painless.
regarding RCU serialization - i think that is the way to go - i dont
think there is any sensible way to extend RCU to a fully preempted
model, RCU is all about per-CPU-ness and per-CPU-ness is quite limited 
in a fully preemptible model.
could you send those RCU patches (no matter how incomplete/broken)? It's
the main issue that causes the dcache_lock to be raw still. (and a
number of dependent locks: fs-writeback.c, inode.c, etc.) We can make
those RCU changes not impact the normal !PREEMPT_REALTIME locking so it
might have a chance for upstream merging as well.

ok, i now understand what you mean. The way i drove it wasnt really via
code review but via: 'compile kernel, look at the bootlogs, fix the
first lock reported, repeat' iterations. This was much easier and much
more reliable than trying to figure out lock dependencies from the
source. The turnaround for a single lock was 2-3 minutes in the typical
case, allowing the conversion of 90 locks in a couple of hours.

it's not just the problem of PMutex - i believe it's mainly the plain
inadequacy of the 30 raw locks you have identified - and identifying the
locks is the bigger work, not the semaphore implementation. I'm now at
90 locks (20% of all locking in this .config) and that's just to quiet
the DEBUG_PREEMPT violations on my testboxes.
and no matter how well UP works, to fix SMP one has to 'cover' all the
necessary locks first before fixing it, which (drastic) increase in raw
locks invalidates most of the UP efforts of getting rid of raw locks. 
That's why i decided to go for SMP primarily - didnt see much point in
going for UP.

there are in-C variants of Linux mutexes and rw-semaphores in the kernel
source, so worst-case we could just make use of them in the
PREEMPT_REALTIME case. I'm not a big fan of assembly optimizations (or
having to touch assembly optimizations) at an early stage like this.
