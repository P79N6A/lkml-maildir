This and the other fireworks would suggest that the kernel thinks there is
RAM in some hole in the memory map. 2.2.x kernels have the memory map
handling shot (this machine here, P2 UP on an intel SR440BX mobo with one
128Mb stick recognizes just 64Mb on its own). Try 2.3.46 or so, and look
what it tells you about RAM distribution (sorry, can't run that here as it
hangs when mounting CDs).
