The inherent instability of binary modules is a religious myth. Any 
module can be stable or unstable, depending on how it's written, tested 
and the environment (hardware/evolving APIs it depends on). For 
example, Apple's current Mac OS X is extremely stable imho, despite the 
fact that their hardware drivers are generally binary-only.
The same goes for trustworthiness. It's a matter of point of view / 
preference whether you trust open-source projects and their security 
(which can be far from perfect, as evidenced by the recent break-ins in 
various servers hosting source repositories) more than stuff produced 
by a corporation. Every model has disadvantages and advantages. 
Responsible projects, people and corporations usually all care a lot 
about their reputation and can be trustworthy, regardless of the 
specific form in which they distribute software.
I think that Rik is right when saying that the key information that 
should be conveyed is who is responsible for providing support. The 
wording should be kept neutral, without negative connotation nor 
religious bias.
