16K stack is serious "people who cant program" country.

True enough, but then we can go to
	andl %%esp, %0
	movl (%%eax), %%eax
which doesnt really change the cost much, lets us colour the task structs
nicely, and lets us colour the stack somewhat by offseting esp from the base
- and all in standard instructions
