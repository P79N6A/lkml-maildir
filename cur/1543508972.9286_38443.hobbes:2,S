Subject: [patch] Updated PS/2 mouse detection patch

Johan Myreen suggested that I modify the patch I posted earlier to skip
the auxiliary port detection logic if the BIOS detected a PS/2 mouse
connected because the port detection logic did not always work on all
machines.  Here is an updated patch with that change.
