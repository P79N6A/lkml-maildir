Well looking at these graphs (and the fixed one from your second  
email), it sure looks a lot like CFS is doing at *least* as well as  
the old scheduler in every single test, and doing much better in most  
of them (in addition it's much more consistent between runs).  This  
seems to jive with all the other benchmarks and overall empirical  
testing that everyone has been doing.  Overall I have to say a job  
well done for Ingo, Peter, Con, and all the other major contributors  
to this impressive endeavor.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
