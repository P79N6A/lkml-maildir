As far as I know this gets specifyed explicitly in the assembler code
itself. I can remember to have been reading about the defficiencies
of 16 bin asm code in gas several years ago and there it was stated. 
And yes the new gas is supposed to support 16 bit code correctly.
Otherwise the gas wouldn't be able to warn wbout it. (As in fact
does in the newes binutils!)

I was just cleaning up cases which where looking like moving
a 32 bit register into a 16 bit one. The former gas versions where
making sens of those cases for themself.

Yeep.

As far as I can see gas acnowlendges those cases.
