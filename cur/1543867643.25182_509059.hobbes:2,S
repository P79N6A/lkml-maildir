I actually agree - it would clearly be *nicer* if gcc was accurate with 
the warning. I'm just saying that usually the patch to shut gcc up is 
quite benign.
But yes, it basically disabled the warning, and just *maybe* the warning 
was valid, and it disabled it by initializing something to the wrong 
value. 
That's why warnings with false positives are often much worse than not 
having the warning at all: you start dismissing them, and not even 
bothering to fix them "properly". That's especially true if there _isn't_ 
a proper fix.
I personally much prefer a compiler that doesn't warn a lot, but *when* it 
warns, it's 100% on the money. I think that compilers that warn about 
things that "may" be broken are bogus. It needs to be iron-clad, with no 
question about whether the warning is appropriate!
Which is, of course, why we then shut up some gcc warnings, and which gets 
us back to the start of the discussion.. ;)

It's true that it sometimes works that way. Not always, though.
The gcc "uninitialized variable" thing is *usually* a good sign that the 
code wasn't straightforward for the compiler to follow, and if the 
compiler cannot follow it, then probably neither can most programmers. So 
together with the fact that it's not at least _syntactically_ ugly to shut 
up, it's not a warning I personally object to most of the time (unlike, 
say, the pointer-sign one ;)

This is actually something we've tried. 
The problem with that approach is that once you have tons of warnings that 
are "expected", suddenly *all* warnings just become noise. Not just the 
bogus one. It really *is* a matter of: warnings should either be 100% 
solid, or they should not be there at all.
And this is not just about compiler warnings. We've added some warnings of 
our own (well, with compiler help, of course): things like the 
"deprecated" warnings etc. I have often ended up shutting them up, and one 
reason for that is that yes, I have literally added bugs to the kernel 
that the compiler really *did* warn about, but because there were so many 
other pointless warnings, I didn't notice!
I didn't make that up. I forget what the bug was, but it literally wasn't 
more than a couple of months ago that I passed in the wrong type to a 
function, and the compiler warned about it in big letters. It was just 
totally hidden by all the other warning crap.

I agree that it's "unnecessary code", and in many ways exactly the same 
thing. I just happen to believe that casts tend to be a lot more dangerous 
than extraneous initializations. Casts have this nasty tendency of hiding 
*other* problems too (ie you later change the thing you cast completely, 
and now the compiler doesn't warn about a *real* bug, because the cast 
will just silently force it to a wrong type).
And yeah, that may well be a personal hangup of mine. A lot of people 
think casts in C are normal. Me, I actually consider C to be a type-safe 
language (!) but it's only type-safe if you are careful, and avoiding 
casts is one of the rules.
Others claim that C isn't type-safe at all, and I think it comes from 
them having been involved in projects where people didn't have the same 
"casts are good, but only when you use them really really carefully".

No. I'm saying that I have *reasons* that I need my string to be unsigned. 
That makes your first "fix" totally bogus:

And the second fix is a fix, but it is, again, worse than the warning:

Sure, I can do that, but the upside is what?
Getting rid of a warning that was bogus to begin with?
