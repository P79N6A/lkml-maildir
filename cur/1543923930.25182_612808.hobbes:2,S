Yeah, I figured that. My main worry has more to do with some fishy
assumptions the powerpc VM code does regarding what can and cannot
happen in those locked sections, among other things. I'll have to sit
and think about it for a little while to convince myself we are ok ...
or not. Plus we do keep track of various MM related things in per-CPU
data structures but it looks like Paul already spotted that.
Cheers,
Ben.
