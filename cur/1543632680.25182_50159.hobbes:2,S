   >From what I can see, the only other place where KM_USER0 is employed would be 
   in the *_highpage() helper routines in include/linux/highmem.h. These 
   routines are used in various places, but are usually not protected against 
   (soft and hard) interrupts or kernel pre-emption. Could it be that the latter 
   is what is causing trouble?
Any sort of interrupt whatsoever would be enough to cause a problem
here.  It is enough of a condition to allow the sunrpc code to
run.
This has nothing specific to do with preemption, although the fact
that KM_USER0 usage does not block preemption is worrysome.
