If you are worried about running out of requests, you can always
have your driver declare its own request table. This is what I'm
doing for the CD/DVD-R/W packet writing, since I have to generate
several new requests every time I get a new write. Stephen
Tweedie suggested doing it this way.
You might end up having to do a lot of the end_request
functionality manually though. Have you thought about
clustered requests? end_that_request_first handles
these for you too. If you do decide to call _last
first, make sure you transfer the request semaphore
to your new request.
