Ok, I havn't actually checked the code , but no, they don't have the
same requirement. they pin and unpin the user space memory at the
beginning and and of the operations. 
take aio pseudo code:
aio_write()
{
	pinmem();
	if (file)
	add_write_to_disk_queue();  
	.
	.
	.
};
kernel_aio_completion_handler()
{
	unpinmem();
	send_completion_event_to_task();
};
