Yes, my patch is not an ultimate solution, rather a step in the working
way :)

I wouldn't say, its bad, it is only not supported yet under all
circumstances. But DHCP support may be improved for example by adding the
MAC address as entropy bytes to the secondary pool. Since we don't
add bytes to the primary pool, we don't harm things that really require
secure random data. Any opinions about this workaround?
