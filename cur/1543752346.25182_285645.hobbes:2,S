Okay. I believe there is a patch floating around for 2.4 that is used in 
some of the other distro's kernels that adds REPORT LUNS scanning as 
well as a flag to force LUN scanning (although not sure it works if LUN 
0 is not present).
A pragmatic solution may be to just add the echo scsi add-single-device 
x x x x > /proc/scsi/scsi into your early boot or configure one of your 
slices on LUN 0 (if the Xserve RAID allows that). 2.6 (and RHEL 4) 
support the REPORT LUNS so should work there although there are some 
messages on linux-scsi about the Xserve RAID's specific handling of LUN 
0. Probably good idea to post to linux-scsi.
