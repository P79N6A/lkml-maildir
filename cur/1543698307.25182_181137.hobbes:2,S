2.4 has continued life, yes.
But the real question is, should 2.4 continue to be developed?
I agree with Marcelo, increasingly the answer should be "No".  New
features and core changes should be intended for 2.6.  Bug fixes,
security errata, and the like will always be OK for 2.4.  Just like Alan
continues to release new 2.2.x releases, when major bugs are found.
There needs to be a progressive tightening of patch acceptance standards
in 2.4, IMO...  and Marcelo announced he will be doing just that.
