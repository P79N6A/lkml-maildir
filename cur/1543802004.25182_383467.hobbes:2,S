this deserves expanding.
What net/usb/scsi queue is *deltas* to the kernel.org kernel. This is
fundamentally different from having the main driver be in its own
repository. Each delta is meant to do a certain change to the driver, eg
it's a CHANGE BASED thing. While "own repository" is "here is new
code" (even though you can disguise it as changes pretty well).
The linux development model is based on introducing changes, not on
introducing new code (of course the difference goes away if you
introduce a new driver, but that's a corner case)
The result is also highly different. In the net/usb/scsi case, there is
no "we need to move changes in mainline to our tree or they get lost".
The only thing needed would be resolving conflicts in the proposed
changes in the subsystem maintainers queue and the changes already in
mainline.
Note: this is independent of what kind of tool is used to store and
distribute such changes. quilt and git are used most, but git can also
be used in a CVS way if you want. But it's the "the main driver is in
the kernel, and we have proposed improvements to it" that counts (versus
"we have the main driver that we push to the kernel occasionally if we
feel like it").
