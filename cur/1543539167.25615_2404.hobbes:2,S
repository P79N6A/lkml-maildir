Hey Alan - 
Thanks for the info.  ;-)  From your response, I expect I should have
been a bit more specific.  Let me try again....  ;-)

My intention is to use these techniques only for some connections (the
connections to the file serving daemon I'm working with).  Hence, the
effected connections will always be TCP connections and have a
well-known application header structure.  AFAICT, this just requires
that the TCP stack not be confused by non-contiguous data after the TCP
portion of the packet.  (The receiving side also requires early
demultiplexing of connections on the NIC, so I'm playing with the Alteon
gigabit driver & firmware as well...)

The file serving app I'm working with doesn't have any reason to touch
the data, so I'm going to do the DMA straight from the disk buffer
cache.  The only user-level data that needs to go out is a relatively
small application header, which can easily be copied into kernel space.
