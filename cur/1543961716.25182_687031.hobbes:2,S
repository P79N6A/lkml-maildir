This is hwclock from Debian/stable (i.e. 2.12r-19etch1).  With
Debian/unstables (2.13.1-5) this happens to:
	sh-3.1# /sbin/hwclock --systohc -D
	hwclock from util-linux-ng 2.13.1
	Using /dev interface to clock.
	Last drift adjustment done at 1209474623 seconds after 1969
	Last calibration done at 1209474623 seconds after 1969
	Hardware clock is on local time
	Assuming hardware clock is kept in local time.
	Waiting for clock tick...
	/dev/rtc does not have interrupt functions. Waiting in loop for time from /dev/rtc to change
	RTC_RD_TIME: Invalid argument
	ioctl() to /dev/rtc to read the time failed.
Oh, there is a new version in Debian/unstable (2.14~rc1-1), nothing new
though:
	sh-3.1# /sbin/hwclock --systohc -D
	hwclock from util-linux-ng 2.14-rc1
	Using /dev interface to clock.
	Last drift adjustment done at 1209474623 seconds after 1969
	Last calibration done at 1209474623 seconds after 1969
	Hardware clock is on local time
	Assuming hardware clock is kept in local time.
	Waiting for clock tick...
	/dev/rtc does not have interrupt functions. Waiting in loop for time from /dev/rtc to change
	RTC_RD_TIME: Invalid argument
	ioctl() to /dev/rtc to read the time failed.
I looked a bit in the source of hwclock (from unstable) and IMHO it does
strange things.  E.g. I wouldn't do
	if (getuid() != 0 && systohc) {
		fprintf(stderr,
			_("Sorry, only the superuser can change "
			  "the Hardware Clock.\n"));
		permitted = FALSE;
	}
I wonder further why do_rtc_read_ioctl has a return type of int if it is
unchecked in read_hardware_clock_rtc which unconditionally returns 0.
(Ah, OK, do_rtc_read_ioctl always returns 0, if there is an error,
exit() is called.  Nice.)
Anyhow ...
Ah, reading the hwclock is necessary to adjust /etc/adjtime.  So the
correct way to set the hwclock is 
	# /sbin/hwclock --systohc -D --noadjfile --utc
But as you already suspect, this doesn't help either.
I'll write a bugreport to Debian as I now don't fancy to work with that
piece of code anymore. :(

Right, the busybox I have here behaves fine.

Currently it doesn't, the ioctl function for RTC_RD_TIME simply does:
	err = rtc_read_time(rtc, &tm);
	if (err < 0)
		return err;
	if (copy_to_user(uarg, &tm, sizeof(tm)))
		return -EFAULT;
	...
	return err;

For my rtc it's even better:  There are two flags that indicate that
the clock is running and the time is valid.  So I can do
	if (!clock_is_running || !time_is_valid)
		return -EINVAL;
	else
		readtime(&tm)
		return 0;
I remember that the rx8025, an rtc I wrote a driver for some time ago,
had something similar.
Best regards
Uwe
