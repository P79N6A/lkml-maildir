we are talking about the same thing, re-read my mail. this design assumes
that 'goodness' is constant in the sense that it does not depend on the
previous process.
and no, your are not using the same goodness() function, you omitted the
prev->mm == next->mm component to goodness(), due to this design
limitation.
