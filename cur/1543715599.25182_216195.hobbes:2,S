Subject: Need hack to test short socket I/O

Hello All,
    I would like to check to make sure a program can handle I/O on sockets
which do not accept/return as much data as the program tries to
send/receive.  It is difficult to test this since it does not happen
frequently.  I would like to hack the kernel somehow so that socket I/O
happens either 1 byte at a time or perhaps (n+1)/2 bytes at a time, where
n is the number of requested bytes.  Does anyone know a simple way to do
this?
Thanks,
Jim
