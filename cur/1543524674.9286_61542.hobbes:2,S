Ah, but Stevens is (was, may he rest in peace) of the opinion that a
linger time of 0 should send a RST, and a stack that did not do this
was broken.  (Mind you, having an application being able to send a RST
is unreliable because such a RST is not retransmitted, which is the
reason I always suspected Linux did not allow it -- but I would love
to hear that said out loud (and in the comments) by the Linux network
folk, given that Linux goes against the standard here.)
