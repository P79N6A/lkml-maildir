Well I may switch to the GX1 setting later when it actually appears in
the kernel.

So the SC1200 is a GX1 and CS5530 in one chip then (given the SC1200
doesn't need a companion chip)?  Currently I use the SC1200 ide driver.
So far no DMA, but that could be because I use compact flash on the ide
connector.  The card claims to support DMA though as far as I can tell.
or is the SCx200 using it's own ide system?
