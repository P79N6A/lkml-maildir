It's complaining about a mutex_trylock() being run from irq context.
And indeed that's buggy - the non-debug version of spin_lock_mutex() is not
irq-safe.
I'd say that's pretty dumb of the mutex interface, really.  Doing a
mutex_trylock() should be OK from all contexts.
This is caused by a recent semaphore->mutex conversion and it's in mainline
now.
Ho hum.  I suppose a suitable workaround would be to convert hdaps_mtx back
into a semaphore.  ug.
