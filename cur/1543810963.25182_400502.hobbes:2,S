Perhaps they should just turn some computers off over night then.
Another drawback is that adds very long latencies. e.g. when it is
enabled you can really end up with desktops where the mouse
doesn't react for a very visible to humans delay.
And it'll mess up kernel timing in general.

It should IMHO depend on EMBEDDED on i386 too because
the uses are extremly specialized (if there are any) and most users setting it 
probably set it by mistake because they misunderstand it.
