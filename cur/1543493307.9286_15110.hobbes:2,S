We aren't talking "normal Linux systems", we are talking "capability
secured Linux systems" here. What makes you think that nobody would ever
run named(8) as user named, group named, so it (via normal permissions) can
only read the zones for which it is responsible (and nothing else!), while
named-xfer(8), running as user named-xfer can write over the ones it is
slave server for, but nothing else? The daemons today run as root because
currently it is the only way to get the capabilities they need.

S[UG]ID was invented _precisely_ to enable some processes to have powers
above and beyond the ones the invoking user has. If this is _so_ broken as
you claim, the SUID root stuff is a even much worse risk!
Truth is, only SUID root gives you access to widely useful extra
capabilities, so it's the most used.

Nope. ext3 will always be compatible with ext3. You can't expect ext2 or
VFAT or NTFS or NFS or CODA to be able to handle highly sensitive binaries
if they don't handle capabilities sensibly, so there isn't a problem there
at all.

Yep.

Double yep.

Please. This means including _several_ incompatible kludges into the
system, that interact in unknown ways, to make it "more secure"? You can't
be serious.
