No! People who have problems with the support for large rsize/wsize
under UDP due to lost fragments can
  a) Reduce r/wsize themselves using mount
  b) Use TCP instead
The correct solution to this problem is (b). I.e. we convert mount to
use TCP as the default if it is available. That is consistent with what
all other modern implementations do.
Changing a hard maximum on the server in order to fit the lowest common
denominator client is simply wrong.
