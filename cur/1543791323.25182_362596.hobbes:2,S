 Hello,
   the current interface is very low-level, while the proposal
 from Pavel/John has a much different scope, imho.
 
  I'm working on a led driver for the ixp4xx/NSLU2 which
 has 2 leds plus a multi-coloured one. 
  We would benefit a lot from such an implementation so,
 FWIW, I express my personal support and the one
 of the whole nslu2-linux community. 
  Once this patch is upstream, the linux-arm interface could easily 
 be adapted to use it or cooperate nicely.
