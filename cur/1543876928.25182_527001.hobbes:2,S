Just put it in its own file in mm/ rather than its own file in lib.
lib should be for almost-standalone stuff, IMO (ie. only using basic

Yes, I think ioremap.c should be in mm/ as well.

Apart from these users outside mm/, I don't see much point in converting
things over. The page table walking API we have now is neat and simple.
It takes a few lines of code, but is it a big problem?
