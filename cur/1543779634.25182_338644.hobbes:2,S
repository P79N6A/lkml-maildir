The email subject..... "Re: **SPAM** [PATCH 3/3] usb gadget driver for 
MQ11xx graphics chip" ... Was that an accident, or did my email server 
take over my headers?  (i'm not running any spam filering software or 
anything)
If this happened on your end, you might want to re-send that one... Some 
email clients automatically filter messages containing "**SPAM**" in 
subject line.
