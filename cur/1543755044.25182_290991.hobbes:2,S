Interesting. On my FC2 (without udev) under 2.6.11-rc2-bk5
both programs work fine with /dev/dri/card0 in its default
 permissions - 666 (obviously).
However, if I manually chmod /dev/dri/card0 to 660 I don't
 get a SEGV, but rather
[asuardi@incident asuardi]$ glxgears
libGL error: failed to open DRM: Operation not permitted
libGL error: reverting to (slow) indirect rendering
711 frames in 5.0 seconds = 142.200 FPS
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
[asuardi@incident asuardi]$ ooffice
libGL error: failed to open DRM: Operation not permitted

And both still work.
