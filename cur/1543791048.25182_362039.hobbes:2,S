Probably.

2.6.14 `make allnoconfig':
gcc-2.95.4:
	bix:/usr/src/25> size vmlinux 
	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	 665502  152379   55120  873001   d5229 vmlinux
gcc version 4.1.0 20050513 (experimental):
	bix:/usr/src/25> size vmlinux
	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	 761415  151851   55280  968546   ec762 vmlinux
(There's a new reason for retaining gcc-2.95.x support)
(gcc-4.x can probably be tuned up with appropriate `-malign' options)

2.5.71, gcc-2.95.4:
	bix:/usr/src/aa/linux-2.5.71> size vmlinux 
	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	 501892   54163   40420  596475   919fb vmlinux
yes, it got bigger.   .data went through the roof - maybe inlined debug stuff?
2.6.8.1, gcc-2.95.4:
	bix:/usr/src/aa/linux-2.6.8.1> size vmlinux
	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	 605032  153817   58176  817025   c7781 vmlinux
It happened somewhere between 2.5.71 and 2.6.8.
2.4.x doesn't have allnoconfig, so no numbers for that.
