James,
What is the status for this patch?  We need to submit more patches based
on the acceptance of this patch.
Thanks.

Matthew,
I think my last email confused you. Here are the points for submitting
this patch:
1. It is only to add the ia64 support to our driver.  This is why we add
the ia64 flag.
2. We did not change the implementation for x86 and x86_64.  The
implementation for them with u32 * is there from day one.
3. What I wanted to convey in my previous mail is that if one uses a 64
bit application (s)he may need to test for all functionality again.	
Regards.
Bo Yang

Then this patch isn't acceptable.  You need to find a way which works
for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.

look, we understand that you're interested in selling us this operating

retrograde step."
