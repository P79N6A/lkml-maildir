By the way ... is it common that you get several thousand waiting
processes?  I ask because you wake them all up, then the herd thunders
into the l_icloglock spinlock.  Or is this a worst-case scenario that
happens once in a blue moon?
If l_flushsema does typically get more than one waiter, we can instead
wake the waiters one at a time.
