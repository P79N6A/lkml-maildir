    i.e. you mean that PCI-ISA bridge doesnt provide enough
  realtimeness to fill internal sb buffer?
     yes it sounds like that, because i can hardly
  realize their existence at 11025... (but i suppose
  if they were, i hardly would be able to hear them...)
     i have the next "but": isn`t internal sb buffer
  enough large to flatten these io peaks?
     even more: sound click even when i strike the key once, with 100% probability.
     ofcourse this is maybe because mc sends alot of data
  over the bus in the response to the keypress.
     it also explains why less clicks only after
  first-after-consoleswitch-keypress.
     but next why: why "find /" does not achieve
  same effect? the datastream is _way_ larger!
