Nobody replied but let me do my last report.

My ECS K7VTA3 5.0C is useless with Linux since I can't get
ethernet to work with IO-APIC, and without it modprobe usb-uhci
just freezes everything. It may be a broken motherboard. I
can't believe all 5.0 have so many problems, but...
...I wonder what's so different in Windows XP. As I reported
ethernet and USB work together there.
My last try was ACPI, but while the ethernet worked, the USB
and onboard sound didn't:
# modprobe usbcore
...
# modprobe usb-uhci
...
Sorry, I couldn't copy all lines, but you get the idea.

Any sound loops at the start and the kernel reports

I also tried ACPI with noapic, but things got worse. The
ethernet and sound worked, but everything reported an awful
amount of APIC error on CPU0: 40(40). 'shutdown -r now' did the
same and I finally rebooted with SysRq.
My last ECS, really. The BIOS is even worse. If you disable
RAID and 1394 the menus just disappear and you can't reenable
them.
