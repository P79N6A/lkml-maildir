You probably mean ERESTARTSYSNOHAND.
There are lots of system calls that simply are not restartable. So 
TIF_SIGPENDING in general should be set only if required, and not "because 
it's easier".

This is what ERESTARTNOHAND does, but quite often if you get interrupted
you have to return _partial_ results, which is quite inefficient and
sometimes breaks programs (ie you get things like a read() from a pipe
that returns a partial result because you resized the window, and a 
SIGWINCH happened - and that is _bad_).
The old code tried rather hard to make signals that were truly ignored 
(SIGSTOP/SIGCONT is not of that kind) be total non-events because of 
things like this.
