I'm afraid that one won't compile:
arch/alpha/kernel/pci.c: In function `pcibios_fixup_final':
arch/alpha/kernel/pci.c:128: `ALPHA_ALCOR_MAX_DMA_ISA_ADDRESS' undeclared
(first use in this function)
arch/alpha/kernel/pci.c:128: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only
once
arch/alpha/kernel/pci.c:128: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [arch/alpha/kernel/pci.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/alpha/kernel] Error 2
The only reference I could find was in asm-alpha/dma.h:
define MAX_ISA_DMA_ADDRESS         ALPHA_ALCOR_MAX_DMA_ISA_ADDRESS
but no definition.
