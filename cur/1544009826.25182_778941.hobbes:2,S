Such printk will sure bite more people.  And it's amazing that the CodingStyle
document uses printk as an 80-column example:
 80 The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is a strongly
 81 preferred limit.
 82 
 83 Statements longer than 80 columns will be broken into sensible chunks.
 84 Descendants are always substantially shorter than the parent and are placed
 85 substantially to the right. The same applies to function headers with a long
 86 argument list. Long strings are as well broken into shorter strings. The
 87 only exception to this is where exceeding 80 columns significantly increases
 88 readability and does not hide information.

 90 void fun(int a, int b, int c)
 91 {
 92         if (condition)
 93                 printk(KERN_WARNING "Warning this is a long printk with "
 94                                                 "3 parameters a: %u b: %u "
 95                                                 "c: %u \n", a, b, c);
 96         else
 97                 next_statement;
 98 }
