You could just tell people the truth. Something far worse that DANGEROUS.
Like:
CRIPPLED BY LEGAL DURESS 
Or as I come to understand:
The processes that would normally have fixed this driver by now
are broken by the vigorous defense of Microsoft's IP.
It will trash your disk! maybe not right now ..
I couldn't understand why I hadn't seen any real movement on this driver.
Now it makes sense. Perhaps others might enjoy this understanding.
