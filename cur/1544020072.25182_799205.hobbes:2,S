Here is the output after applying the patch (fresh boot btw) -
[   29.698877] eth0: PCI_COMMAND reg = 0x406 (bit 1 is on)
[   29.698880] eth0: Reg value at offset 0x0 is 0x167b14e4
[   29.758169] ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready
[   31.295087] tg3: eth0: Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex.
[   31.295090] tg3: eth0: Flow control is off for TX and off for RX.
[   31.297574] ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): eth0: link becomes ready
[   41.872007] eth0: no IPv6 routers present
^^^ Pre-Suspend
[  245.924484] eth0: PCI_COMMAND reg = 0x406 (bit 1 is on)
[  245.924487] eth0: Reg value at offset 0x0 is 0xffffffff
[  247.317971] tg3: eth0: No firmware running.
[  258.710634] ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready
^^^ Post-Suspend
So it looks like the memory space IO is enabled before and after suspend.
The device/vendor id goes 0xffffffff after resume - just like before.
Does that one matter? (Firmware may be looking at it?)
