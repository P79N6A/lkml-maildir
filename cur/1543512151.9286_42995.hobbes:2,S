Hi there
I got a slight little problem here
Everthing was working fine when I used the Kernel Version prior to
2.2.10
after I installed and configured that Kernel I have major problems with
Kernel
OOPS they seem to be network relatet to me. But also KDE has problems
when
I try to configure the desktops and every now and then when I do a
reboot the computer
freezes when it tries to unmount.
I add the oops.txt I created with ksymoops
I gziped it cause it was so big
And by the way, I don't know if it helps, here are the specification of
my system
PII 300 on a Gigabyte Board LX
128 MB Ram
Elsa Victory Erazor (Graphics card with the NVidia 128 chip on it)
Soundblaster AWE 64 Value (ISA)
Adaptec 2940 SCSI controller
2 SCSI HD
1 SCSI CD-ROM
1 SCSI CD-Writer
1 SCSI TAPE (DS2)
1 SCSI Scanner
A Realtech 8029 PCI Network adapter
I hope you are able to find out what is wrong
Thanx, Achim
P.S. greetings from Germany
