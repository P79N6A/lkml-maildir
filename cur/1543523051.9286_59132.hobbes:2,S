You want 256 threads on a 128 cpu box, ok no argument

And what happens when someone comes along with a performance issue. Do you
try and cope with excessive threads, 20Mb of kernel overhead, trashed
caches or do you put your thinking hat on. In java you have very poor AIO
facilities which doesnt help (I believe the newest java stuff fixes this ?)
