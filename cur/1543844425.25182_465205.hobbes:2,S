I think it would just start a new lio group if it encounters another _GROUP
iocb.  (The code probably has a bug in that for LIO_WAIT only the latest group
seems to be taken into account in such a case, but that should be easy
to fix ... in fact maybe we could do the waiting using sys_io_wait, 
as suggest in which case it is no longer an issue)

There was some discussion way back on linux-aio - we seemed to be going
back and forth between introducing new syscalls and overloading what we
have. There was another more recent discussion with Ulrich on the API
(if you look up the POSIX AIO discussion thread, you should find that one)

Hmm, it would be nice to implement a sys_io_wait for the IOCB_CMD_GROUP
iocb instead of performing the lio_wait() within io_submit. But what
should the semantics for sys_io_wait be for other (regular) iocb types
where there is no lio association (seems non-trivial to implement) ?
Should we just return -EINVAL for those cases ?

The iocbs have to be built dynamically anyway by glibc, so does it
matter ?
