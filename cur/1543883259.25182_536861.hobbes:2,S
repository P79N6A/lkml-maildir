I meant "between 1 and 2 weeks"  - so each bug hits linux-kernel once,
any only if no-one seem to care.
If I ask for bugs changed in the last 7 days I get 80
If I ask for bugs changed in the last 14 days I get 114.
So today, that list would have (114-80) = 34 bug, which I think it is
manageable to glance through and think "Would I like to care".
