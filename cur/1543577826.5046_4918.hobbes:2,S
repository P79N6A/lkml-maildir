Subject: [PATCH] Fix typo in drivers/video/amifb.c in 2.4.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/1/7/259

This fixes a comment at the end of an #endif.  This should fix all of 
the warnings about tokens at the end of #endifs.  Please disregard 
the parts of my earlier patch which made changes to comments 
and .S files.  I should have reviewed the patch the script made 
more closely.
