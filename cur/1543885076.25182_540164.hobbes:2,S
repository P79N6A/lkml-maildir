Well, a paravirtualized ring0 kernel may still have special constraints
on how the gdt can be set up (page-aligned, read-only, etc).

Yep.  At least if the boot-version is new enough to boot this way.  The
old native-boot path can reload as much as it likes.

Why not just treat them all in the same way?  Especially if we start
sweeping other non-virtual architectures like voyager/visws/etc into the
same mechanism.
My idea was that "goto native_boot" would jump to code which assumes
it's running on real hardware, where there's no problem reloading
gdt/segment registers, etc.
