What nonsense.  Go read the docs.

Hey genuis.  Download BK, install it, get into emacs, and type the key
strokes you just described.  What happens?  I'll let you in on a little
secret, smart boy, it does exactly what it should do.  Works just like
it were RCS or SCCS.  It was carefully designed behave exactly like SCCS
so that emacs/make/patch/etc all just know how to use it.  Try patching
a BK repository w/ patch(1) and you'll see
    retrieve file from revision system with lock?
Just works.  Fits neatly with the tools that we all know and love.
So explain to me again how it is that the tool is "totally useless"
when it works *exactly* the way you say it should?
