That comes out as a side effect of kernel build 2.5, every object gets
-DKBUILD_OBJECT to define the name it is known by.  From
Documentation/kbuild/kbuild-2.5.
      -DKBUILD_OBJECT=module, the name of the module the object is
        linked into, without the trailing '.o' and without any paths.
        If the object is a free standing module or is linked into
        vmlinux then the "module" name is the object itself.
        Automatically generated.
Post kbuild 2.5 I will be writing a generic parameter/command line
interface so you can insmod foo bar=99 or boot with foo.bar=99.  You
will even be able to boot with foo.bar=99 when foo is a module, insmod
will use the command line as a default set of values.
