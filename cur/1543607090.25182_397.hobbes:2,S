It's rather convoluted, but a commit fires if:
1: more than approx 1/4 of the journal has been used by the
   current transaction or
2: this transaction has been open for >5 seconds.
And a commit will close off the current transaction, but will *not*
open a new one.  Opening a new transaction will only happen when
new writes come in.
So there should be no commit activity on an fs which isn't being
written to.
You can watch all this happening by building with debug support and
running
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/jbd-debug
You may want to stop syslogd first though - otherwise you get into
this loop where commits create logs and logs create commits.  Tends
to fill your logs up rather boringly.
