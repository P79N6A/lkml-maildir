I have a different vsprintf variant - vpprintf(). It takes a function and
a data pointer, this function is called with the print buffer and within
that function you can take care of the locking. The only problem is that
%n doesn't work anymore, but it's not used anyway in the kernel (as far as
I can grep :) ).
bye, Roman
