Ugh.  So some BIOSes use it for legitimate reasons (like thinkpads), and
some use it to work around BIOS bugs.  Great.

Mine didn't, but it does have an HPA.  Thankfully we weren't disabling
it yet when I installed my laptop -- I know others who weren't so lucky.
So this partitioning scheme hasn't always been the case...
And it seems broken anyway.  The point of the HPA is to make the OS see
a smaller/different disk layout, unless it's actually trying to update
things that are "protected", right?  If so, the partition table pointing
outside of the the disk when the HPA configuration hasn't been changed
from the bootup default totally broken :/
It really sounds better (to my naive mind, at least) to whitelist the
known-broken BIOSes.

Well, installers probably should be aware, yes -- that's why I mentioned
userland interfaces to enabling/disabling.  But to me it still seems
like we want to disable the HPA during installation and bootup, but only
if your BIOS is doing things wrong.

Point taken.
