I'm not sure whether it's related, but...
My systems all have NE2000 clone cards installed, one being PCI, the
others all ISA, and I use 192.168.252.* for my network. When I try
pinging 192.168.252.255 the ONLY node to respond is 127.0.0.1 for some
reason...
I've tried the same with the Linux systems in the University, and in
each case, the behaviour is the same...
Kernel versions tried: 2.0.3[3456], 2.1.12[4-9], 2.1.13[012],
2.1.131ac1[012], all behave the same way in this respect...
Suggestions, anybody?
Best wishes from Riley.
