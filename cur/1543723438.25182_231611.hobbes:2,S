No. That's why you specify how you'd like the memory to be treated.  If
you don't want the memory to be accessible only via IO accessors, then
you specify DMA_MEMORY_MAP and take the failure if the platform can't
handle it.

There is no "new" kind of memory.  This is currently how *all* I/O
memory is accessed.  DMA_MEMORY_MAP is actually the new bit since it
allows I/O memory to be treated as normal memory.

There is no "must guess".  Either the driver specifies DMA_MEMORY_MAP or
DMA_MEMORY_IO.  If you specify DMA_MEMORY_IO then you have to use
accessors for dma_alloc_coherent() memory.  If you never wish to bother
with it, simply specify DMA_MEMORY_MAP and take the failure on platforms
which cannot comply.

It can *only* happen if you specify DMA_MEMORY_EXCLUSIVE; that preempts
the GFP_ flags and the application must be coded with this in mind. 
Otherwise it will respect the GFP_ flags.
