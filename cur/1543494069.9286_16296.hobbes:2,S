Hmmmmmm.......
I have found that these messages with a drive making a clanking noise is
an indicator of S.M.A.R.T failure.  This was observed imperically.
I was a Quantum drive, and I contacted on of the design engineers that I
know.  If I recall correctly, this conclusion was verified.
"funky Linux driver", Please clarify and suggest a solution.
Where did you get the info about forcing "PIO Mode 3"??

Since the drive is not in any (active) DMA modes from his report,
one can conclude that PIO4 may be active.
