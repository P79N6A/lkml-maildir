This is a pretty old bug that has been worked on, can we get someone to test
a system and validate the bug?
Here's a USB addition, could go into #10 as it's pretty annoying but not a
show stopper.
++ usb-uhci and JE driver will both hang the machine on a warm boot when an
external SIIG 4port hub is plugged in and has been used in a previous boot.
The function call trace is usb_uhci->start_uhci->pci_write_config_word.
Hangs on popf near end of pci_write_config_word.

Did you/someone have a patch to try and address this?

Note; if I set up ESD to listen on a tcp port, connecting locally sounds
horrible.  I haven't looked to see who's fault it really is.
