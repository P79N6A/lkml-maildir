Most subsystems also implement this (a custom allocator for tracking
memory leaks) so, yes, I think it's generally useful. However, adding
yet another custom allocator is not the way to go. Perhaps some of the
fs developers could cue in here to talk about how they track memory
leaks? Pretty please?
In the meantime, please drop the custom allocator from your code.
