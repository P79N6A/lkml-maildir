Well, this is a secondary matter.

Recent X versions have keysyms for the multimedia keys, with 
names like XF86AudioPlay, XF86VolumeUp etc. In your keyboard 
setup you can choose an inet module specific for your 
multimedia keyboard (provided it's supported) and the scancodes 
will be converted to the correct keycodes with the attached 
"multimedia" keysyms, which you can then map to the whatever 
action you might want.

Or rather not, due to the RAW mode emulation (see also my posts 
on my problems with configuring the multimedia keys of my Dell 
Inspiron 8200 with the 2.6 kernels).
