Not true at all. The GPLv2 leaves it up to the person placing their work under 
the GPLv2 license that its up to them whether they want the license on 
their "covered work" to be able to be changed. That the boilerplate includes 
this clause is pretty pointless - anyone can easily remove the "or, at your 
option, any later version" clause and render section 9 meaningless as applies 
to their work.

Incorrect. Read section 9 of the GPLv2. It's pretty clear that the "any later 
version" clause is optional. Whats more is that since the modern linux kernel 
*IS* a "composite work" composed of Linus' original code with changes 
contributed by other people - Linus retains copyright to the work as a whole. 
This means that he can license it in any manner he chooses, as long as it 
doesn't affect the copyrights (or licensing) of the people that have 
contributed changes. I don't have to go to the US copyright law for this - 
Linus released Linux under the GPL, others made changes and sent them back 
saying "You let me have access to your code under the GPL, I've made some 
changes that make it better. You can have my changes under the GPL." QED: 
Linus still holds copyright to Linux and can license it in any way he 
chooses. This is limited because of the license he accepted when adding the 
changes back to his code. He may have locked the kernel, as a whole, to 
version 2 of the GPL - but that is his right. There is nothing he has done 
that has stopped people from having their code included that is still "v2 or 
later".

Because there has been no need to quote the GPLv2 until it became clear that 
people were going to keep claiming it stated things it did not. Since then 
I've started quoting the relevant sections of it.
But I agree with you - the thread was fun. And then I realized that the 
discussion was going nowhere at all. So I'm going to answer the last few 
messages in my inbox and then start filtering messages with this topic off 
without reading them.
