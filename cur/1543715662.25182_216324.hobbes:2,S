I believe that it would be more correct to say that ide-scsi is not 
required to burn CDs and DVDs, providing you use cdrecord which has been 
modified to work with ide-cd. Since that's the major use it equates to 
"not needed" if that's all you do.
As you seem to note, some DVD burners don't work without ide-scsi unless 
you have some tricks and/or patches, but do work with ide-scsi. Yes, 
even in 2.6.
I totally agree you should try to run without it, but I'd compile it as 
a module in case you need some additional data points.
