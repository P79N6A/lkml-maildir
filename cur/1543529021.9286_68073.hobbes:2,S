Which kernel version will fully support the Trident Cyber 9525(generic) in
vesa FB mode?
Xwindows can talk to this card perfectly: even up to 1024x768x16bit
I want to run the console in the same mode 1024x768x16bit (LILO:317)
however when I do this, all I get is a completely black screen
I have compiled the kernel with all the correct options and fonts, still to
no avail.
I am using 2.2.14-mdk (mandrake 7.0)
