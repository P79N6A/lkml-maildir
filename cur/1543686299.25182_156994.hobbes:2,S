Fundamentally, the PCI ID list is not C code.  And if anyone ever wants 
to get to the PCI ID lists at the _source code_ level, they have to 
parse C or assembler :)  It's data, so I say, put it in a data file. 
Stuffing the PCI ID list in C code is a sometimes convenient, sometimes 
inconvenient form of packaging, nothing more :)
I would rather store the PCI ID list in a more natural form, and then 
use small tool to generate the pci_device_id tables that are linked into 
the kernel.
