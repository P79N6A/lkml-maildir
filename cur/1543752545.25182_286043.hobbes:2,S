Symlinks are the solution against this breakage. And if your software comes
from the dos world where temporary files are stored in the same directory
as the binaries (remember SET TEMP=C:\DOS ?) then you have no possibility at
all, but the application design by itself should be frightening enough to keep
away from it.
