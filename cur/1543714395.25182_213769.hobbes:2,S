Since I will be on holiday until the end of April please feel free to take 
your time (although I stay highly interested).

On the other hand, since I will need to interleave random data "quite often" I 
prefer my blocks not be too large (although this shall be a choice for the 
end-user).

I got it, thank you.

Thank you in advance.

You are right.

I will to this once I come back from holidays (no net there).

It does, thank you.
