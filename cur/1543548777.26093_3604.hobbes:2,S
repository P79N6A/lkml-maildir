Reversing that, you mean the drive should be given requests on an FCFS
basis until it is running flat out, at which point elevator sorting should
come into play? That's what I would suggest: under light loads, requests
are then handled with no extra latency at all, but we still get increased
throughput under heavier load.

Then process one queue until it's empty, even if there are higher priority
requests in another queue? I'm not so sure about that: then my backup
program or a file copy will be getting between my MP3 player and the disk.

How does your approach block lower priority processes? If they were to
issue a request before a higher priority one, it is inserted into the
"filling" queue; once we switch queues, this request will be handled -
perhaps before a higher priority request, if we're unlucky with the
timing?
If we can keep it sorted reasonably efficiently, a single rolling queue
seems better - or perhaps model it on the process scheduler? Have
"realtime" requests ("it doesn't matter if everything else locks up, this
request MUST be completed ASAP"), then "other" requests of various
priorities?

If the code ever sits there sorting the queue out, while the disk goes
idle, the code needs adjusting: getting requests processed in a
sub-optimal order is still better than not getting any requests processed
at all for some period of time!

That's one approach; I prefer my "weighted scoring" approach. Supposing we
have three devices: a solid state disk (instant "seeks"), a hard drive and
a tape. The SSD will benefit from merges (fewer commands to process), but
not hugely - set both the metrics at 1, so a 64Kb request is just under
twice the "cost" of a 32Kb one. The hard drive can seek fairly quickly,
but long reads are preferable - say, seek_cost = 16, block_cost = 1. A
single 64Kb request is "cheaper" than a pair of 32Kb requests, but not
hugely so. Then the tape: seeks can take a few minutes, so make it
seek_cost = 65536, block_cost = 1: we don't really care how much is being
read, within reason, since seeks are so "expensive".
In short, having a single rolling queue (probably divided into priority
classes) seems preferable; we should also bypass the elevator entirely if
the device is able to accept new commands at the time. (Q: how
intelligently will drives which handle command queueing themselves be??)
