The original 802.2 stack from procom, used frame_t all over the core stack,
with only the entry/exit points manipulating skb's. On entry from the core
networking stack and from upper protocols (NetBEUI in procom case) they
allocated a frame_t from a pool and initialited pointers to the mac and llc
headers and stored the skb type in another frame_t member, pointing to the
skb memory and used those pointers instead of skb->h and skb->nh.  That
way, I think, they could use the core for several OSes.
Maybe Jens should use something like WAITQUEUE_DEBUG if he want to know
where alloc_skb and friends were called, see include/linux/wait.h 8)
