Hi Adam,
> Patch also includes the multicast_list code that Jochen suggested.  
The new driver works OK for me and even OSPF is working (and with
additional IPv6 patches to other parts of the kernel even IPv6).
The only nitpick is that i receive lots of these in my syslog/dmesg:
tr0: No free TPL
Do you have any idea what may cause this? Other than this message,
everything else works just fine.
Cheers,
Jochen
