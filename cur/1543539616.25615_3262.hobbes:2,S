Subject: 2.4.0 firewalling code: reject with type 3 code 13

Is there any reason why we should not reject incoming TCP/UDP/ICMP (echo request)
packets with ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) code 13?
	communication administratively prohibited by filtering
I was suprised by a machine on the internet doing so and couldn't adapt
my shields^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hfirewall rules with iptables in a similar way. Both
iptables (--reject-with option) and the kernel need to be updated for this to
work.
