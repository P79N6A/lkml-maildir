Yeah.  I've tested and this one works.  I don't have any other copy
protection schemes that are broken.  Of the cd-rom based, older
safedisc still worked, and the newer one needs a special device driver
that wine cannot load properly yet.  It's more likely if there is a
problem with one that it's a problem with wine at this point.
