Here's where your argument is inconsistent with the Linux philosophy.
Linux has a strong philosophy of practicality.  The goal of Linux is to 
do useful things, including provide applications with the semantics they 
need to do useful things.  The criteria for deciding what goes into 
Linux is heavily weighted towards what works best in practice.
Whether or not some API matches someone's Platonic ideal of of an OS 
interface is not a criterion.  In Linux, APIs are judged by their 
practical merits.  This is why Linux does not have such things as 
message passing and separate address spaces for drivers.
So whether or not a proposed set of epoll semantics is consistent with 
your Platonic ideal of "use the fd until EAGAIN" is simply not an issue. 
 What matters is what works best in practice.
