In the case of ipfwadm and ipchains, that was precisely the changeover to
2.6... ipfwadm is from 2.2, obsoleted by ipchains in 2.4, and both axed in
the timespan promised.
devfs was never widely used, and was also announced to be killed by 2.6,
IIRC.

That /is/ what is happening, modulo needless changes in version number.

They were carried along exactly to keep the promise of killing them off by a
certain date.
It seems you are going by what is called around here "Palos porque bogas,
palos porque no bogas" (roughly translated, "get whipped for rowing, and
get whipped for not rowing").

Sorry, but again:
- Userland API is remarkably stable, only some stuff with intimate kernel
  connection have ever changed
- In-kernel API has /never/ been stable. At all. Sure, changes are much
  faster now (the community is larger, the tools are better, ....).

It /was/ called 2.6...
