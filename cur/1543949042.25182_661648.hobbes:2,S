Thank you for the explanation!

But if the scripts say all 'se.wait_max' are < 40 msecs than it is
not CFS' fault, right? Even if it takes 3 seconds for a typed letter
to appear in the terminal?

Yeah, I must try latencytop to check for more things before sending
an email reporting possible problems. 
Thanks again!
