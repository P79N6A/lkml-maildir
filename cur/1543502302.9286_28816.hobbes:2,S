   Applications would like to have defaults;  if the user doesn't specify
   the icon of their dreams, you need to have SOMETHING to fall back on
   unless you're fond on making the users find the invisible icon.

   So have the default icon be in {self}/ICO, so if the UI can't find
   an icon anywhere else it will look there; this way you don't drop
   the icon on the floor when you move or rename the application.
