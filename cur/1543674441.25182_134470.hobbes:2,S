This is not directly a kernel problem.  I developed this after
a glibc upgrade.  The problem is most distros (such as redhat)
make a symbolic link
   /etc/localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles
or whatever your timezone is.  On some of my systems, /usr/share is on
a disk partition that is not mounted at the time the link is needed
during initialization; the system then defaults to UTC.  As a result,
each time you boot up your system loses a time equal to the difference
between UTC and your local time zone.
To fix this, just make sure /etc/localtime is actually a file on the
root filesystem, not a link to a possibly unmounted filesystem.
Just copy the one pointed to by the link.
I have systems with the same partition/mount layout which have no
problem, so I don't know why some systems get confused.  So far I
have only seen this on laptops.
