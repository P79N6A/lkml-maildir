It is obvious to someone who knows what the kernel is. A kernel and
a process is very different things.  A comparison to something
different:
A book always have a "page 1".  It is usually only the title, so it
is a nice place for writing some notes as well. 
(similiar to how a process have an environment.)
A library is a big collection of books, (similiar to how the kernel
manages a collection of processes.)  Still, it does not make sense
at all to talk about "page 1 of the library!"  Even if it _is_ useful
to write some library-specific notes somewhere.
The kernel does not have an environment of its own.  It manages all
the processes, and jave equal access all of the environmnts 
(albeit in a hackish way only) for process envirnments are _not_
part of the kernel/process communication interface.
