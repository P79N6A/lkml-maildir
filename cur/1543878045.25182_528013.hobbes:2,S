firstly, testing on various workloads Mike's tweaks work pretty well, 
while SD still doesnt handle the high-load case all that well. Note that 
it was you who raised this whole issue to begin with: everything was 
pretty quiet in scheduling interactivity land. (There was one person who 
reported wide-scale interactivity regressions against mainline but he 
didnt answer my followup posts to trace/debug the scenario.)
SD has a built-in "interactivity estimator" as well, but hardcoded into 
its design. SD has its own set of ugly-looking tweaks as well - for 
example the prio_matrix. So it all comes down on 'what interactivity 
heuristics is enough', and which one is more tweakable. So far i've yet 
to see SD address the hackbench and make -j interactivity 
problems/regression for example, while Mike has been busy addressing the 
'exploits' reported against mainline.

It comes down to defining interactivity by scheduling behavior, and 
making that definition flexible. SD's definition of interactivity is 
rigid (but it's still behavior-based, so not fundamentally different 
from an explicit 'interactivity estimator'), and currently it does not 
work well under high load. But ... i'm still entertaining the notion 
that it might be good enough, but you've got to demonstrate the design's 
flexibility.
furthermore, your description does not match my experience when using 
Mike's tweaks and comparing it to SD on the same hardware. According to 
your claim i should have seen regressions popping up in various, 
already-fixed corners, but it didnt happen in practice. But ... i'm 
awaiting further SD and Mike tweaks, the race certainly looks 
interesting ;)
