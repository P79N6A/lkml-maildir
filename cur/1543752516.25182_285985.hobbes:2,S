You completely missed my point. What's classed as a threat to one
user just isn't relevant to another.

Nowhere did I make that claim.  If you parsed the comment about
exec-shield incorrectly, I should point out that we also issued
security updates to various applications even though (due to exec-shield)
our users weren't vulnerable.  The comment was an indication that
the extra barrier has bought us some time in preparing updates
when 0-day exploits have been sprung on us unexpectedly on more
than one occasion.
