The MTRR code calls it with retry=1 and with another spinlock held,
and this is fine. In fact, I wrote smp_call_function() to support the
MTRR code (and similar codes I have sitting around which I'll submit
when I have the time). I don't see the problem that is being alluded
to.
So please don't change smp_call_function() yet. Explain to me the
sequence of events that can cause a deadlock.
