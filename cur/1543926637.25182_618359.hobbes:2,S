Hi  Adam,
 If this condition check is not included, the root user have to use the 
function
 setrlimit() to set the lock_limit of a normal user to RLIM_INFINITY.  I 
think
 the /proc interface 'hugetlb_shm_group' is introduced to avoid these 
difficulties.
 Please correct me, if I am wrong.
 Regarding the problem with the 'if' condition, I feel that even in the 
case of
 user's lock_limit is set to unlimited, he could use unlimited hugepages and
 normal page shm segments. So what is the advantage in this scenario.
 I tried to avoid the #ifdef statements. But the variable 
sysctl_hugetlb_shm_group is defined
 in fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c, this segment is enabled only when the config 
parameter
 CONFIG_HUGETLBFS is set to yes. If the hugetlbfs is  not selected while 
configuring,
 there would be a compilation error.
 Is there any better way so that the root user can configure the gid in 
'hugetlb_shm_group'
 and the user is able to access the huge pages using shmget().
Thanks
Ciju
