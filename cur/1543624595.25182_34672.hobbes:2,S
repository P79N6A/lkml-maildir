... as well as a push-out to the ISA bus.  I suspect dumping the outb
way of doing it and instead wait in the CPU might cause the delay to
happen in the wrong part of the system (consider split-transaction
queued busses like HyperTransport, where a delay in the CPU doesn't
necessarily mean a delay in the southbridge.)
Port 0x80 has served us well, at least as a default.  If you really
care about the POST display you can recompile using a different port.
