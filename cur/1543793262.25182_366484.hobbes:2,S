The process is like maintaining any other part of the kernel:
  - Try to make sure it works on all releases (harder to do with a full
    arch, I know, but not impossible.)
  - keep it up to date with bugfixes and the such
  - be responsive to questions from other developers
  - accept patches from others and intregrate them into the mainline
    version in a reasonable ammount of time.
Does this arch have corporate support behind it to maintain it over
time, or is something you are going to do in your spare time (which is
fine, just curious.)
