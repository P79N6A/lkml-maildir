I have a mystery here guys.
Tonight I tested.  I set up my system so that both sudo and root could 
`alsactl store/restore' using -f to explicitly use /etc/asound.state.
Once both user and root could store/restore with no errors, and all my apps 
work (midi, mic, KDE sound etc. etc.) I made /etc/asound.state immutable:
nick@linuxamd:nick$ lsattr /etc/asound.state
----i-------- /etc/asound.state
I then edited /etc/rc.d/rc/alsa to use the -f and expilicity point 
to /etc/asound.state
Rebooted...
Loading ALSA mixer settings:  /usr/sbin/alsactl restore
/usr/sbin/alsactl: set_control:894: warning: name mismatch (Mic Select/3D 
Control Sigmatel - Depth) for control #74
/usr/sbin/alsactl: set_control:896: warning: index mismatch (0/0) for control 
#74
/usr/sbin/alsactl: set_control:994: bad control.74.value type
Heh.  Every reboot I get a different control error.  But why it all works OK 
before a reboot with the same very /etc/asound.state file I don't know.
