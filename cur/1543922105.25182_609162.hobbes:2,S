Might as well change comment around KERN_CONT -- for starters it lied
about "early bootup" phase since day one.
Proposed text:
	/*
	 * Annotation for a "continued" line of log printout (only done
	 * after a line that had no enclosing \n).
	 *
	 * Introduced because checkpatch.pl couldn't be arsed to learn C
	 * and distinguish continued printk() from the one that starts
	 * new line.
	 *
	 * Caveat #1: Empty string-literal, so compiler can't check for
	 *            KERN_CONT misuse.
	 * Caveat #2: Empty string-literal, so it can't be used in
	 *            printk(var); situations.
	 * Caveat #3: takes characters on the screen, so code is harder
	 *            to read.
	 * Caveat #4: checkpatch.pl doesn't know C, so it can't check
	 *            for KERN_CONT misuse, anyway.
