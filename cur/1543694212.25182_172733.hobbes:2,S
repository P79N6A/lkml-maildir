Achtually, with HZ at around 100 (or oven 70..80), an old i386 or i486
will *start* just fine, at least at 8MB. However, over some days /
weeks, the machine gets slower and slower (my testdrive: my 90MHz
P-Classic with 16MB). Even with that "much" RAM, I get hit by whatever
slows down the machine. I *think* that it's the MM subsystem, but I'm
really not skilled enough with it to blame it:)
