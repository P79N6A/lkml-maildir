Last time I suggested that, people did not want it.
Probably about 9 months ago. Don't remember exactly.
We came to the decision that if a driver depends on some weak
ordering, it should either directly use mmiowb() or have its
own locking wrapper which wraps spin_unlock() and mmiowb().
There is one little problem in practice with something
like spin_unlock_io().
spin_lock_io(&lock);
foovalue = new_foovalue;
if (device_is_fooing)
	writel(foovalue, REGISTER);
spin_unlock_io(&lock);
That would be an unneccessary sync in case device is not fooing.
In contrast to the explicit version:
spin_lock(&lock);
foovalue = new_foovalue;
if (device_is_fooing) {
	writel(foovalue, REGISTER);
	mmiowb();
}
spin_unlock(&lock);
