Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.18-rc3  Minor LDM fix

Hi Marcelo,
Please can you apply this minor patch to fs/partitions/ldm.c
(support for Windows Dynamic Disks)
Cheers,
  FlatCap (Rich)
  ldm@flatcap.org
Some people have problems reading the end of the LDM database
which is at the end of the physical disk.  This patch reduces
a couple of minor checks, to just debug output.
