Perhaps.  On the other hand, combining selinux with digsig you get:
	1. selinux integrity controls on crucial digsig files, which
	digsig does not (and should not) protect itself
	2. digsig controls over selinux entry types.  So now you can
	protect domain transitions with small, verifiable entry points
	which are then signed to boot.

Every home should have one.

Sounds like a good basis for a new tiny distro.
