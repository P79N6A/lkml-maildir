It is _not_ wrong to have a semaphore start out in locked state.
For example, it makes perfect sense if the data structures that the 
semaphore needs need initialization. The way you _should_ handle that is 
to make the semaphore come up as locked, and the data structures in some 
"don't matter" state, and then the thing that initializes stuff can do so 
properly and then release the semaphore.
Yes, in some cases such a locked semaphore is only used once, and ends up 
being a "completion", but that doesn't invalidate the fact that this is 
a perfectly fine way to handle a real issue.
