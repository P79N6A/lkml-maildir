Thanks for still maintaining this patchset. I sometimes have coworkers
complain that they cannot build 2.4 anymore because they have let their
distro automatically upgarde gcc to 4.x. I will be able to point your
site to them. I was also thinking about updating my page on "linux
kernel useful patches" with this last update, but noticed you still have
a "patch-more-gcc4-fixes" file. Is it absolutely needed or just a cleanup ?
