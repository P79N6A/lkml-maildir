I know about this bug and I plan to fix it one day.
I have not considered it important because the bug is only triggered
by following connditions:
1) In kernel hacking the check headers options is selected
2) make is older than version 3.80
Documentation/changes do not require us to use make 3.80.

[PATCH] kbuild: disable headers_check
The headers_check command requires make version 3.80 due to use
of ordered dependencies. But kernel build does otherwise
not require this recent make.
Disable the option until it get properly fixed.
