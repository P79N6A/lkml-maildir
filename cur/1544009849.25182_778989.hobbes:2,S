Well, the "too early" part is fixed with the PCI resume changes in -next, 
and googling for "APIC error on CPU1: 00(40)" shows that it's actually 
pretty common. Which is sad, but makes it somewhat less scary.
The fact that it happens at resume for you (and not randomly) does imply 
that we perhaps don't have a wonderful APIC wakeup sequence and are doing 
something slightly wrong. But it likely isn't a big deal.
Is that message new? If it is, maybe you can pinpoint roughly when it 
started happening, and we could try guess which change triggered it.
