I suppose you are thinking of a request that lists a number of PIDs along
with a number of field IDs. In that case yes, I agree that it makes sense
to provide some explicit feedback to the tool once we add access control
(before that, there is no ambiguity: a missing answer means ESRCH).
The most common request, though, won't provide a list of pids, it will
only provide a list of field IDs and select all processes in the system
(NPROC_SELECT_ALL). There is no ambiguity here, either: The tool didn't
ask for any specific process to begin with, ESRCH doesn't make sense
here. And for a system that looks anything like /proc does today,
fields that are capable of triggering EPERM are few and far between,
certainly not something you are hitting unexpectedly in the fast path
of a process monitoring tool.
Thanks, by the way, for all the feedback that helped me realize that
I have so far failed to explain the design well enough. I will try to
work on that.
