Hmmm. I feel like we're mixing signals. See below for more on this.

I feel like we're talking about different problems. Which reference
clock (other then the system clock) are you wanting to increment at the
tick time? Do you mean the ntp time_offset value? A little bit of psudo
code might go a long way in helping me understand your solution.
Also I'm not sure how this is connects to the continuous timesource
situation where we do not assume timer ticks are not lost or late.

Again, I must not be understanding what you're suggesting.  Above where
you called get_timesource_interval(ppm) too expensive, what you're
suggesting here is almost exactly what get_timesource_interval(ppm)
would do.  In my timeofday patches, its called cyc2ns() and gettimeofday
looks like:
  xtime + cyc2ns(timesource, ntp_adjustment, cycle_delta)
Where cyc2ns does:
  (cycle_delta * (timesource->mult + ntp_adjustment))>>timesource->shift
The reason why we calculate the interval_length in the continuous
timesource case is because we are not assuming anything about the
frequency that the timekeeping_periodic_hook() is called.
Again, I'm really wanting to address your concerns, but I still do not
really understand the specific objections. 
thanks
