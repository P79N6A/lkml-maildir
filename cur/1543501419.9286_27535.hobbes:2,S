I cannot, nor will I say much on this... but there were some really
screwy parts of the Cyrix contract with IBM.  For every wafer They made
for NSC/Cyrix, IBM got to make one for themselves, basically at Cyrix
expense.  I also believe these wafers were not entirely indentical in
the way they were fabbed.
Please note, this is going on info I have that is old... and I am not
sure I remember it all.  Just rest assured this is entirely possible due
to the situations that were back then.
