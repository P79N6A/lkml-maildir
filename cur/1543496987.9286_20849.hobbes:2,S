In addition to what has already been mentioned I also recommend "id-utils",
you can get id-utils-3.2d.tar.gz from 
ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/
(earlier versions had some funny problems).
With id-utils you can do things like
cd /usr/src/linux/kernel
gid hard_reset
.../drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.c:280:static void hard_reset (struct Scsi_Host *host);
.../drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.c:1167:        hard_reset (host);
.../drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.c:6068: * Function : void hard_reset (struct Scsi_Host *host)
.../drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.c:6073:hard_reset (struct Scsi_Host *host) {
.../drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.c:6184:    hard_reset (host);
(it ignores e.g. hhard_reset).  It works nicely from inside emacs, I use
it all the time when I change a function and the callers must be fixed.
The emacs interface takes you to all the right places.
