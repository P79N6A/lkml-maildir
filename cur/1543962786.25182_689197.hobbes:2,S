I was thinking of the possibility of per-subsystem list of
instrumentation sites, which would become more or less fixed, anyway,
which is what you seem to propose here. Given that it also cleans up the
scheduler code, I think it's interesting to do.
Do you have an updated version following Andrew's comments I could Ack ?
