I have an AMD Duron processor, which from what I know should have 128 kB of
L1 cache, and 64 kB of L2. However, dmesg reports:
CPU: L1 I Cache: 64K  L1 D Cache: 64K (64 bytes/line)
CPU: L2 Cache: 1K
CPU: AMD Athlon(tm) Processor stepping 00
Obviously the L2 reporting is incorrect.
I'm running Linux 2.4.0-test6.
