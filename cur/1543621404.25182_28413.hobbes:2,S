I did try fiddling with bdflush, and I was able to get them to read and
write at what looked like the same time, but the resolution of "vmstat 1"
wasn't really good enough to see.  Also, I think the overall throughput
was the same, where as it should be roughly twice as high (shouldn't it
be possible to read and write as fast as the lowest speed of both
drives?).

I'll take a look at this.
