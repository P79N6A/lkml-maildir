What problems exacly are you referring to?
Besides the AMD Elan cpufreq driver I see nothing where CONFIG_MELAN
gave you any real difference (except your highest goal is to avoid a
recompilation when switching from the Pentium 4 to the AMD Elan - but I
doubt the really "prevents development").
But I'm not religious about this issue. Let Robert decide, the Elan 
support is his child.

What's wrong wih the -march=i486 Robert suggested?
