Guys,
sorry for having been silent for so long ... since i had the problem, i
upgraded to 2.6.15.6 and i experienced the problem again over the week-end.
My point it that it appears that the BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!
message is legitimate in my case since my machine really freezes
periodically because of ide timeouts.
What i'm trying to figure out is why are the IDE timeouts occuring ?
Both my DVD burner & CD burner usually work fine ( i had been able to
burn a DVD a few hours before the problem occured , i'm able to read CDs
& DVDs fine ).
However, the problem seems to occur only when trying to rip CDs. It
appears that both drives get confused .... ( see logs, both are
reporting timeouts/erros ).

And i can confirm that when this happens the machine is totally
unresponsive, as before i had to reboot the machine with a hard reset
after a while.
So my question is what could be causing this behaviour ? is this a bug
in the IDE driver ? a hardware problem with my drives ( as i said they
appear to be working fine otherwise ), another hardware problem with my
motherboard ?
What could i do to help troubleshoot the problem ?
Thanks in advance.
