I used dentry->d_inode->i_sem.  While I'm not very familiar with the ins
and outs of the filesystem code, that ought to be safe enough.
The real problem was finding a way to indicate that the file was
disconnected from its kobject.  I did that by setting
dentry->d_inode->i_mode to 0.  (I didn't want to erase dentry->d_fsdata
for fear that it might be needed somewhere else.)  That's definitely not a
good way; it was intended only for my proof-of-principle.  No doubt
someone else could do a much better job.
