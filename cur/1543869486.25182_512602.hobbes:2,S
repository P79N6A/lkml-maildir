Hi Con.
I usually don't pay a lot of attention to benchmarks. Responsiveness
under load is much important to me.
But this is nice: I use FC6 with initng as boot process manager. With
vanilla 2.6.20 boot process takes 21 to 23 seconds; with 2.6.20-ck1
(same config, of course), boot process takes 17 to 19 seconds.
So your patchset has become my patchset of choice.
Regards,
Fabio
