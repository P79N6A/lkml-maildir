And note that if it gets implemented on ARM on pre-fadvise() glibc,
the syscall argument order is rather non-standard: fd, action, start,
size rather than fd, start, size, action - since otherwise we run out
of registers with EABI.
The kernel community needs to get a grip with the implementation of
new syscalls - we need a process where architecture maintainers get
to review the arguments _prior_ to them being accepted into the kernel.
That way we can avoid silly architecture specific syscall changes like
this.
