If your first reaction after seeing 0.99.7a 0.99.7b 0.99.7c was
that they were numbers in unrelated units a b c and cannot be
compared with each other, you need to get your head examined ;-).
I concede that it is a cute point you tried to make [*1*], but I
do not think your presentation was convincing enough.
[Footnote]
*1* Which one is the heaviest, 5h, 3kg, or 20cm?
