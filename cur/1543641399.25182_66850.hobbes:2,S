Well TMTA CPUs would seem to be easy, because all this is done behind the
OS's back, right?
Let's talk about CPUs in which the OS has to control processor performance.
The way I see it, there are a bunch of inputs that are going to determine
CPU speed & voltage: user preference, workload, and thermals.
Wouldn't you have your initial perf setting determined by the workload, and
then revised down, based upon user preferences (such as "I want to conserve
battery") and the thermal requirements?
Any workload analysis has to be in the kernel. The user interface can be one
that just allows a limit to be placed upon the setting the workload demands.
Then, the thermal control can further drop the setting, if needs be.
