Perhaps a WARN_ON(irqs_disabled()) in clock_was_set() would help.  But probably
the one in smp_call_function() will suffice.

yup.  I once played with adding warnings in places like spin_lock_irq(), 
but there were false positives from places which were odd-but-correct.
It would be worth revisiting however.
