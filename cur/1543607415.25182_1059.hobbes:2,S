"disableapic" is not in 2.4.13 vanilla. Some SuSE hack?
Anyway, try "noapic" instead. That should disable the kernel's use of
the IO-APIC. The local APIC is a completely different beast, and it is
unlikely to have anything to do with your interrupt routing problems.
Failing that, recompile with CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=n and CONFIG_SMP=n.
