reproduced.
it took more or less one hour to reproduce it.  I could reproduce it olny
running also irqbalance 0.55 and commenting out the sleep 1. The message 
in
syslog is the same and then, after a few seconds I think, KABOM! system 
crash
and reboot.
I tested also a similar system that has 4 dual core CPU Opteron 2600MHZ. 
On
this system (linux sees 8 CPU, but it is the same kernel, same gcc, same
config, same glibc, same active services) I could not reproduce it even
running irqbalance 0.55 in almost 1 hour. Maybe I could reproduce it 
waiting
for more time, but my users need to do their work, so I could not have a
longer test window. So on 16 CPU I had the crash, on 8 CPU I had no crash.
I need to give back the system to the users, so if you need other tests,
please, tell me as soon.
thanx
Luigi Genoni
