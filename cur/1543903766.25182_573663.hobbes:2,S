Very briefly then: "User mode" and "kernel mode" refer to the CPU's
hardware privilege level.  A process makes the transition from user
mode to kernel mode by executing a system call.  Interrupt and
exception handlers also run in kernel mode, but they generally are not
considered to be part of any process.  The reverse transition occurs
when a process returns from a system call, or when an interrupt which
occurred while the CPU was in user mode completes.  (It's interesting
to note that system calls are somewhat similar to interrupts; in fact
sometimes they are implemented by a "software interrupt".)
"Kernel threads" are processes that run entirely in kernel mode.  They
usually don't have a memory mapping for any user-owned memory and they
never go into user mode.  All other processes are "user threads".
"Userspace" is a rather general term referring to things not in the
kernel.  It comprises both user tasks (while running in user mode) and
user memory.

If you could actually do it, it would work.  But you can't do it.  If 
it were feasible, the freezer would have used that approach in the 
first place.
For one thing, checking for a suspend-in-progress at the beginning of
each and every system call would add overhead to a hot path in the
kernel, one which is already very heavily optimized.  People wouldn't
stand for it.

You get similar problems from system calls that wait in kernel mode 
until something has happened.  For example, a read() call for the 
console device will wait until somebody types on the keyboard.  At any 
point in time, many (or even most) user threads are blocked in a system 
call.

Let's let kernel K1 be the original kernel, the one which is going into
hibernation.  Kernel K2 is the one started by kexec to write out the
memory image.
Your question becomes: Why should K2 jumping back to K1 cause K1
immediately to start running user tasks?  Answer: Because K1 has been
running user tasks all along (except while K2 was active) and nothing
has told it to stop.  In fact, about the only things which _can_ cause
K1 to stop running user threads are the freezer (which you want to
eliminate) and disabling interrupts (not possible since some drivers
require interrupts to be enabled when putting devices in low-power 
mode).

So when K2 starts up, it will have a phase in which user threads don't 
run.  That doesn't affect K1.  When K2 returns to K1, K1 does not go 
through this sort of phase.  It simply picks up from where it left off.

Indeed, Rafael has suggested that K2 be responsible for putting devices
in low-power mode.  This has the disadvantage of requiring K2 to 
include drivers for every device used by K1, but otherwise it would 
work.
However there still remains the problem of user tasks running after 
devices are supposed to be quiescent and before K1 starts.  There's 
currently nothing to stop such tasks from making I/O requests and 
thereby causing a quiescent device to become active again.

We aren't talking about drivers initializing devices.  We are talking
about what happens during the time when drivers are trying to quiesce
devices (i.e., before K1 has started up K2) or power them down (after
K2 has returned to K1).

Wrong.  People are trying to eliminate the freezer entirely.  Go back 
and reread some of the postings at the beginning of this long thread, 
especially those from Paul Mackerras and Ben Herrenschmidt.
