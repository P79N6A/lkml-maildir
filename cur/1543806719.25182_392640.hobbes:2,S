That's a bit fuzzy and bound to give problems. Why not settle for the 
first case and change their code to check the block count in the 
request? Less flags should be a good thing. And if that proves to be 
insufficient we should do a more thorough investigation once we have an 
actual failure case.

Seems to be a common theme in the more recent drivers. Don't they teach 
people proper layering in the schools anymore? :)
