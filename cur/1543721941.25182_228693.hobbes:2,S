Hello,
I have updated my kernel to 2.6.7-bk2 this morning and it felt faster
than 2.6.7! It feels faster in firefox and it is noticeably faster in
gnome-terminal. Goodness!
But, there is downside as well: the clock runs faster. 125-150% faster ;(
It is weird since the time server does not correct it.
Can I get the speed with a correct clock? Please?
