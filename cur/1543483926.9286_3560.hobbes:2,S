I tried to use the ksymoops included in 2.2.1 to get info about some Oopses
I got on my old 486, but it seemed to hang forever after it got the
"Code: <hex numbers>" line.
So I tried it on a faster machine (a 266MHz PII) and it froze for more than
20 seconds, then finally printed the disassembled code and all normal info.
I tracked this down to the following code in Oops_read (oops.c, line 960) :
        re_compile(&re_Oops_code,
                        "^("                                            /* 1 */
        /* sparc */       "(Instruction DUMP)"                          /* 2 */
        /* various */     "|(Code *)"                                   /* 3 */
                        ")"
                        ":[ \t]+"
                        "("                                             /* 4 */
                          "(general protection.*)"
                          "|(<[0-9]+>)"
                          "|(([<(]?[0-9a-fA-F]+[>)]?[ \t]*)+)"
                        ")"
                        "(.*)$"                         /* trailing garbage */
                        ,
                REG_NEWLINE|REG_EXTENDED|REG_ICASE,
                &re_Oops_code_pmatch);
        i = regexec(&re_Oops_code, line, re_Oops_code.re_nsub+1,
                re_Oops_code_pmatch, 0);
The very long freeze happened in the regexec(),
when line == "Code: <hex numbers>"
Thinking a little, I suspect that the regex expression
"|(([<(]?[0-9a-fA-F]+[>)]?[ \t]*)+)" is the guilty one, in particular the part
saying "((<other stuff>[ \t]*)+)" as regexec probably has to recursively check 
all the line and choose wether to match or not the "[ \t]*" after each character.
I tried replacing that line with
"|(([0-9a-fA-F]+[ \t]+)+[0-9a-fA-F]+)"
which looked more sane to me, but even though the regexec seemed to return
correctly, I just got a SIGSEGV below in the code.
Can anyone shed some light on this? I hope I will be able to use ksymoops on my
modest 100MHz 486 (which compiles 2.2.1 in 23mins, btw), especially because
this just looks like a stupid typo in the regexp pattern.
Bye,
