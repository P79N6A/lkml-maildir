If I recall correctly, the MediaGX/Geode processor does need _p for the
PIT accesses, and that CPU family does have a TSC (even though the TSC
stops at times so is hard to use).  I also seem to remember that the
breakage did not happen very often, but running a system without _p
overnight usually showed one hiccup where a read from the counter got
corrupted.
So unless I'm wrong (which I very well could be, it's been a couple of
years since I was debugging the PIT code on a misbehaving Geode SC1200
based system) there is at least one fairly modern CPU, which is used in
lots of embedded systems, and in active use, which does need the _p.
Just a data point... It's not only ancient systems that need _p.
