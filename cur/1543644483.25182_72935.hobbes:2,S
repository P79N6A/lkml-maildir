Not good enough unless you add those checks at the VFS/MM level. Think
for instance about mmap() where the filesystem is usually not involved
once a pagein has occurred.

Invalidating the mapping is certainly a good alternative if it can be
done cleanly.
Note that in doing so, we do not want to invalidate any reads or
writes that may have been already scheduled. The existing mapping
still would need to hang around long enough to permit them to
complete.

invalidate_inode_pages() *was* NFS-specific until you guys hijacked it
for other purposes in 2.5.x ;-)
