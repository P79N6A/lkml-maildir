IMHO omitting -fno-builtin when compiling the kernel was always a risky
proposition...  Since we provide our own copies of many of the builtins
[which are used in the kernel] anyway... why not always -fno-builtin,
and then call __builtin_foo when we really want the compiler's version..
gcc 3.0 without -fno-builtin is perfectly allowed to assume it can
insert calls to memcpy..
