How much of the subjective interactiveness-feel of the desktop is at the 
mercy of the X server's scheduling and not the cpu scheduler?
I've noticed that video playback is significantly smoother and resistant 
to other load, when using MPlayer's opengl output, especially if 
"heavy" programs are running at the same time. Especially firefox and 
ksysguard seem to have found a way to cause video through Xv to look 
annoyingly jittery.
