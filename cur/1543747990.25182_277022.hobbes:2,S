i did not suggest it was. The reason why i mentioned it was to point out
that _non-RT usage_ does not see any overhead, i.e. ordinary Linux
boxes. (which nevertheless do run RT tasks occasionally.)
of course in the RT-specific it can be common - Mark's test is one such
workload. If it werent widespread i'd not try to solve the problem...
