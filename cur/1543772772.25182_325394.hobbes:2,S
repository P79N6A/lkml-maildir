The problem with that approach is GCC would still just relocate the push/pop
block to the bottom of the function.  This means you won't be likely to pick
up anything useful in L1 or L2 as the function exits normally - in fact
you'd typically be guaranteed to be picking up a partial line of gorp that
is completely worthless later on.
This is one of my issues with the notion of unlikely() being smoothed on
everywhere like Bondo<g> - it also makes it "unlikely" that you'll get any
serendipitous L1/L2 advantages that could be had by locating related
functions next to each other.
When you take the unlikely stuff completely out of line in a seperate
functions located elsewhere, the mainline code can make better use of the
caches.  The Intel parts thrive on L1 hits and die if they're not getting
them.

I see the effect, But I think it would be better to leave the job to
gcc to generate better code for unlikely, imho.
