Hi!
I am running 2.6.0-test11 kernel on Gentoo (i686 AMD Duron). I have HP 7200 
cd burner.
My system hangs everytime I try to  burn my .wav files to cd with cdrecord. 
Usually few tracks go succesfully but then everything stops. Even the mouse 
won't move and powerbutton does not affect.
And if I have understood correctly, Linux should never hang, so hopefully 
some of You will help me.
I am glad if any responses are CC:t to me (tero1001@hotmail.com). I can't 
subscribe to this list because traffic is so heavy.
With best regards,
       Tero
