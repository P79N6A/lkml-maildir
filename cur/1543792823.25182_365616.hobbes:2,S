This depends on the perspective...

The publishing of this function allows uncontrolled access to the
otherwise (and sure purposefully) static symbols; you could as well
globalize the symbols directly. In order for KDB to be a module, this
symbol would even need to be exported. By keeping the debugger access
code in the same file, nothing gets changed visibility-wise for the
outside world.
Further, the design of the debugger extensions of NLKD calls for the
extension code to live in the place their data gets controlled at.
Consider an extension living in a module - how could the debugger access
that information?
