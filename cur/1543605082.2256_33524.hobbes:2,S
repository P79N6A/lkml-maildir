Tim,
Why are we calling for interrupts assignments early?
Since all legacy hosts can reserve BAR's 0-3 to be 0x0000, and there are
two differenct pci interrupts assigned, I am puzzled by the changes?
Obviously there are addon cards that do not fill in the interrupt line,
also if one is doing SMP the value may be shifted.
The real issue is that the initialization of the card/host has a problem,
so that belongs in the pci_fix_up region in the arch/<>/kernel/pc-irq.c
stuff, imho.  In general one should not be changing the interrupt lines at
this stage of the INIT process.
Lastly, if you have a multi-host card and it does not register IO bases
because there are no devices attached, then you have a problem of
nonexistant resources, this is what I truly suspect is the problem w/ the
Cobalt box.
Comments?
Cheers,
