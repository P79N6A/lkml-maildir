I run SMT on all my HT uni systems. Depending on what you do it can help 
up to 30% (kernel build) or just enough to measure. This is one of those 
"it depends" things, I bet there are loads which run better without, and 
there is a tad of overhead in the SMP kernel locking.
If you run SMP, you have that overhead anyway, so I doubt it hurts.
YMMV
