Strangely, it doesn't crash the automount program, but whatever
program is started next in the init scripts.  Then the system
completely hangs.  It worked just fine in 2.3.18.  (I ran that for 23
days until `cat /proc/slabinfo' crashed it.  Does anyone know if that
bug has been fixed, or should I report that one too?  It only happens
after a few days of uptime.)
Using Alt+SysRq+P mostly reports a hang near the end of timer_bh, with
occasionally an address somewhere in process_timeout.
