Things have certainly changed, (for better or worse, I'm not sure), since the 1.3.X days when a development kernel was generally still pretty stable.

Totally agreed.  I was talking about the stable kernel.

Not for Linux, though - I'm talking about years of Linux stability.

That's why I qualified my above comment with 'is a very capable filesystem' :-).
I know what you mean, but I was just pointing out that EXT-2 balances proven reliability in the stable kernel, features, and performance VERY well, infact what other OS family can make that claim?  BSD is the only one I can think of.  Oh, sure FAT has been around forever, but it's somewhat lacking in the features department.
