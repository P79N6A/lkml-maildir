   Expression B
I'm no s390 expert either, but just wanted to point out that expression 
B is 10 times larger than expression A, so something's fishy here.

Looking at include/asm-s390/timex.h:
#define CLOCK_TICK_RATE	1193180 /* Underlying HZ */
makes me wonder if this should be:
#define MAX_IPD_TIME	(5 * 60 * CLOCK_TICK_RATE) /* 5 minutes */
