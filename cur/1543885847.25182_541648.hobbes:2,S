Yes, definitely. Say Documentation/volatile-usage.txt -- this raw
version could be touched a little bit, to have sections that clearly
explain (1) how volatile makes the compiler generate trashy code, (2)
why volatile doesn't even do what people _think_ it does, considering
code is executed out-of-order by _hardware_ these days and not due to
compilers like was the case 20 years back, (3) and so volatile ends up
_hiding_ bugs from people and thus should be consigned to the trash
can of history, (4) _except_ for _really special_ usage cases like
reading IO mapped as memory.
