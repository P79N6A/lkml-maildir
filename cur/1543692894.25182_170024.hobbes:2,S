Hallo list,
I tried many kernels in the last time and I have found that the error is 
somewhere different but I don't know where:
- compiled 2.6.0-test6 -> same error
- compiled 2.6.0-test6-bk1 -> same error
Ok, so I thought, 2.6. does not work, so try 2.4
- compiled 2.4.22 -> same error
Hmm, estonishing, but hey, 2.4.21-debian worked, so compile 2.4.21 
yourself, but
- compiled 2.4.21 -> same error
I really don't have any ideas anymore. Does anyone here has an idea?
Compiler is
gcc (GCC) 3.3.2 20030908 (Debian prerelease)
GNU Make 3.80
thanks
Daniel
