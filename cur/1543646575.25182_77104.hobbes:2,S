Thanks to Meelis Roos for diagnostics off list.

Two functions called xchg_u32, one static, one global.  ksyms contains
c000b88c, System.map contains both c0006424 (arch/ppc/kernel/misc.S,
global) and c000b88c (include/asm-ppc/system.h, static).  Just to
confuse things even more, it is the static version that is exported to
modules.
Kernel coding error, having two functions with the same name but
different scope is just asking for trouble.  Fix the ppc code.

Exported symbols that are in sbss, rather than bss.  Neither modutils
nor ksymoops handle sbss, they only handle bss.  I will do new versions
of both packages to handle sbss.
