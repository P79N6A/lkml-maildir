Subject: [PATCH] remove bogus double softirq processing in cris

I sent this out long ago already, but it's still not in:
  These days irq_exit does all softirq processing, so there's no need to
  call do_softirq again in cris.
Also is there any chance you could switch cris to use the new
CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS code in 2.6.10-rc that would replace most of
arch/cris/kernel/irq.c with generic code from kernel/irq/* ?
