Not "broken" as such.  Just "new gcc warns".

Yuck.  Yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck.
1. Spaces -> source bloat.
2. No tab at the start of the file -> yuck when reading the ASM.
My preferred way of fixing these in ARM stuff is to add <tab><tab><tab>\n\
to each line (with the appropriate number of tabs.  See
arch/arm/kernel/semaphore.c for an example.
