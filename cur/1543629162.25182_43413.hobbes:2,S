Yes, edit /etc/fstab. My file server has loads of partitions and it exports 
them all and /etc/fstab on all clients just mounts them all. Problem being?

They have to fake it yes. Otherwise all existing userspace utilities will 
break. Anod no they cannot be changed otherwise they would no longer work 
on non-Linux platforms and most utilities are UNIX utilities which work on 
everything including Linux. You don't want to break that.

That would break UNIX semantics. Which it seems is exactly what you want to 
do... I don't think you will find many supporters of that idea... As Linus 
pointed out to me the inode is the basic i/o entity in UNIX and hence 
Linux. And that is not going to change...
