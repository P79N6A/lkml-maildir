NT 4.x is also slow as hell on the same hardware where both Linux (even latest
revisions) and 95 works just fine. I wonder -- why ? But may be it's just
something non-related...

Why are you so sure ?

And hooks will add opacity to mix really fast :-((

And it's GREAT ! If feature is REALLY need it will be added eventually.
But if not then chance is high that it will not be added at all and we'll
not have this ugly compatibility problems. BTW if idea requires "fixing the
whole kernel" then it's hardly possible to implement it via separate module
anyway. Hooks or no hooks.

Yes, and then we'll got bloatware like Windows very fast :-))

Not if this means creating something bloat and ugly in place of something
that is simple and clear ... And IMHO easy way to add new features will
make it much uglier fast ... I'm interested in OS to solve MY problems.
I hardly interested in marketshare. There are enough peoples for whom
marketshare is important (RedHat, SuSE, Caldera :-) and they will try to
add ugly and unneeded things in kernel... We must reject them :-) It will be
harder it the future :-/
