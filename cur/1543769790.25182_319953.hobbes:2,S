I think I can handle the chaos and bumbling that is Linus. In fact I
sent this one to Andrew to give it a bit of exposure in the -mm tree
first, but since it's a serial patch I also copied it to Russell as a
courtesy. 
Russell has now said that he committed it by accident, and from that I
infer that he's not going to make a habit of it. So that ought to
suffice for now.
The government department responsible for administering the DPA has a
'Data Protection Help-Line' which I have asked to clarify the situation;
it shouldn't be necessary to pay lawyers to do it. But then again, I can
well imagine that they'll simply refer me to the Act itself rather than
giving a coherent answer, so maybe a paid opinion would be useful.
