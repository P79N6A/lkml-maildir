First off, acpi should be working just fine now...should have been for 
the last couple versions of 2.6.0-test.
Second, you probably shouldn't be using ide-scsi.  ATAPI works just fine 
using straight ide for CDR's so it probably works fine for DVD-R+R+RW 
whatever stupid acronymn they're using today.
Third, you didn't post the actual oops so how is anyone supposed t osay 
anything about this problem?
Fourth, you are using a binary you didn't compile that's probably 
compiled against headers for api's found in 2.4.x which is seriously 
different from the kernel you're running it on. Compile your own 
cdrecord and see how it goes.
