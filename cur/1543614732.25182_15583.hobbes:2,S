I proposed implementing something like this about a year ago (to
replace the nasty centralized knowledge in the MAINTAINERS and CREDITS
files) and was shot down.
I'd be happy to take another swing at this problem once the kbuild-2.5/CML2
transition is done.  But I don't think we should let it block us from
having the good results we can get from that change.
