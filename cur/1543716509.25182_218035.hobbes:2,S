POSIX Test Suite 1.4.1 includes more pthread conformance test cases. It
now also contains test cases covering almost all pthread APIs.
Conformance test cases for options like CPT, TCT, TMR added as well. Bug
fixes made from the previous 1.3.0 version (thanks for Ulrich Drepper's
patches and to everyone who made contributions).
This release has been tested on glibc-2004-04-29 cvs pull (NPTL enabled)
