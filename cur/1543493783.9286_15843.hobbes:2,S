If `uname -r` is returning 2.0.36, you are running 2.0.36. If you don't
believe this do `cat /proc/version`. 
Uname makes a 'C' runtime library call with a pointer to a structure
containing various members (sysname, nodename, release, version, machine,
and domainname). It then prints the results.
You probably did not install your new kernel after you built it, even
though you thought you did.
