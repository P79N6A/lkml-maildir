ok, was just curious. To make this code nicer, we could keep the time 
syscalls from returning small negative numbers.
the core issue is probably:
 jiffies.h:#define INITIAL_JIFFIES ((unsigned long)(unsigned int) (-300*HZ))
the thing is, we did INITIAL_JIFFIES to find _in kernel_ jiffies 
wraparoudn bugs (hung timers, broken drivers, etc.) - we did not want to 
confuse userspace with it.
So how about adding INITIAL_JIFFIES to the sys_times() return value?
