You can't track it back from the crashing cpu if the IRQ stack overflows
either.  So I would rather have crash confused when trying to find the
task_struct.  Then to have the kernel fail avoidably while attempting
to capture a core dump.  
Even if you overflow the stack wit a bit of detective work it should still
be possible to show the stack overflowed and correct for it when analyzing
the crash dump.  Doing anything like that from a crashing cpu (in a
reliable way) is very hard.

Good question, especially as the kernel exports whatever we have for
a task struct today in the ELF note.  No ABI compatibility is
maintained.
Given all of that I recommend an empty NT_TASKSTRUCT to flag the
crashing cpu, for now.
