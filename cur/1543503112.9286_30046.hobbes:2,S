Why is this more pleasant? It can be done without problems in user space.
What you're beginning is a very old flame war: the fork+exec vs CreateProcess(10+
options) argument [Unix .vs. NT/VMS/AmigaOS]. The Unix way has been proved to
be far more flexible than the NT NewCreateProcessIV_with_extension_XX() path.
Don't try to turn clone into CreateProcess please.
