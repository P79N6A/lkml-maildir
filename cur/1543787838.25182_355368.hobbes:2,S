As I stated in previous mails, release_region() undoes all the effects
of request_region().  If you take a look at kernel/resource.c, you'll
notice that request_region() is also compatibility cruft as well.

If that's what you think, thanks for volunteering to fix all the
sysfs and driver model interfaces as well.  The following examples
below functionally correspond to the request_resource()/
release_resource() and would also require fixing if what you think
were true.
request_resource	|	release_resource
------------------------+---------------------------
device_register		|	device_unregister
bus_register		|	bus_unregister
driver_register		|	driver_unregister
