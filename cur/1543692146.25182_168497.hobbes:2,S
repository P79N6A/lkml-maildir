Actually, the latest z90crypt driver for 2.4.21 compiles on 2.6
with only one trivial patch (see below). The chances are good
that it works just as much as on older kernels. It's mostly
just a matter of style and the fact that there is no standard
API for linux hardware crypto driver yet that keeps us from
submitting the driver.
