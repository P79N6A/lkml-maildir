Hello,
On an ARM XSCALE running on a gumstix platform I get the following BUG report at startup
after applying the -rt8 patches. 
BUG: at kernel/sched.c:4031 __schedule()
[<c001cfd8>] (dump_stack+0x0/0x24) from [<c014c214>] (__schedule+0x714/0x764)

This is the warning that is displayed only once to indicate that the irqs are not disabled?
How can this be solved? On the gumstix mailing list this is reported several times without any response.
Please CC me personally.
Greetings Gerrit
