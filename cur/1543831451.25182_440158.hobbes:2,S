Well, that's the easy way out :)
But I'm willing to try to debug this, if you're game.
I don't know how it could see 6 EPs, unless you specify endpoints=6 when
you load the module. Maybe it sees it as 2 devices somehow?
Can you send me the relevant part of 'cat /proc/bus/usb/devices'?
Also the dmesg where you get the 'urb too big'. You could also try to
load the module with debug enabled.
