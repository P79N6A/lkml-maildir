OK, this doesn't work. A multi-threaded init may do execve(). Can we forbid
exec() from non-main thread? init is special anyway. We can simplify de_thread()
in this case, and kill tasklist_lock around zap_other_threads().
So, we can re-parent a kernel thread to swapper. In that case it doesn't matter
if we put task on ->children list or not.
User-visible change. Acceptable?

It would be very nice to introduce CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD instead, then

That is all, very simple. However, in that case we should introduce
	#define SYS_CLONE_MASK	(~CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD)
and change every sys_clone() implementation to filter out non-SYS_CLONE_MASK
flags. This is trivial (and imho useful), but

	arch/sparc64/kernel/process.c
	arch/m68knommu/kernel/process.c

	arch/frv/kernel/kernel_thread.S
	arch/powerpc/kernel/misc_32.S
	arch/powerpc/kernel/misc_64.S
implement kthread_create() via sys_clone(). This means that without additional
effort from mainteners these arches can't take advantage of CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD.
Dear CC list, any advice?
Oleg.
