I can't be sure of course. It's obvious it _can_ be hardware or a buggy
lowlevel I/O driver causing the on-memory corruption. An hardware or
software bug can do anything weird.

So we agree :). In your original email you given an fs software problem as
the less probabile one, and I didn't agreed it was the less probabile one.
The _only_ thing I wanted to clarify with my followup is that the
corruption could be explained also from a genuine fs race (precisely the
one I fixed in 2.2.14).

The path that more probably released the blocks is truncate, and he
probably also released the problematic blocks after getting the complains
while interpreting them.
