I think device states will not be supported in 2.4 kernel, And It could be found in 2.6 kernel. 
Who know the current status? 
Thanks,

I believe suspend() function parameters are expected to tell you *S*
state we are entering. I do not see code that enables drivers to enter
D0 vs. D1 vs. D2 vs D3. I guess it is not there.
