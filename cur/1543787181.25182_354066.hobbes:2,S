Sorry, it's really hard to read your interspersed comments.  Perhaps I
need to switch on some colour option when reading your mails, but I've
never found the need for it before.  Please, use a blank line above
and below your comments to help us locate them and read them, thanks.

No, I meant the current code uses "0" for read fault, "1" for write fault,
and (in a quick search) only found one architecture (I forget which,
certainly not x86_64) which might have been interested to pass down
a different value to handle_mm_fault to distinguish execution fault:
for which I was suggesting to use "-1", rather than change everywhere.
Though now I'm doubting there was any such case at all.
