Subject: [PATCH] Optimize calc_load()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

calc_load() is called by timer interrupt to update avenrun[].
It currently calls nr_active() at each timer tick (HZ per second), while the 
update of avenrun[] is done only once every 5 seconds. (LOAD_FREQ=5 Hz)
nr_active() is quite expensive on SMP machines, since it has to sum up 
nr_running and nr_uninterruptible of all online CPUS, bringing foreign dirty 
cache lines.
This patch is an optimization of calc_load() so that nr_active() is called 
only if we need it.
The use of unlikely() is welcome since the condition is true only once every 
5*HZ time.
