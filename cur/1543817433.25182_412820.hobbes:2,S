I'm looking at using spi_bitbang for a SPI driver and was trying to  
understand were the right point is to handle MODE switches.
There are 4 function pointers provided for each mode.  My controller  
HW has a mode register which allows setting clock polarity and clock  
phase.  I assume what I want is in my chipselect() function is to set  
my mode register and have the four function pointers set to the same  
function.
Is this the right usage model, or should I set the mode register as  
part of the txrx_word[mode] function?
