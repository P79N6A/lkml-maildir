hi all
i built the kernel with a busybox initramfs which runs from a usb stick. While
i boot i need to mount the real root and i'm using pivot_root.
Pivot_root . old-root return to me an "Invalid argument" error and googling i
found here 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/8/17
 that pivot_root should be avoided.
I want to ask now what i should do to switch to a real root?
Regards
S.
