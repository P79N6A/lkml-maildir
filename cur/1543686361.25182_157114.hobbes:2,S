sorry for late reply.
I was wrong, the code that actually uses root= was unaffected.
It happens in name_to_dev_t:
 	if (strncmp(name, "/dev/", 5) != 0) {
 		res = (dev_t) simple_strtoul(name, &p, 16);
 		if (*p)
 			goto fail;
 		goto done;
 	}
it means handle-old-dev_t is meaningless and has to be removed ; and if we want people to use new format, it needs to go into name_to_dev_t.
sorry for confusion :(
