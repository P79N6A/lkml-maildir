Frame pointers enable more deterministic back tracing of the stack,
which can be helpful for tracking down bugs.  I build with
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER enabled all of the time.
Note, however, that current 2.6.x Makefile does not allow frame pointers
to be used with gcc 2.96 since it has some known problems with code generation
when using frame pointers.
There is a little discussion of frame pointers in the Intel
IA-32 Intel® Architecture Software Developer;s Manual Volume 1:
Basic Architecture
and
IA-32 Intel® Architecture Software Developer's Manual Volume 2:
Instruction Set Reference,
which are downloadable as .pdf files from developer.intel.com.
