Another note, it's not meant to be a high resolution latency stats patch
as much as giving a general feel of irq latency in the system. That
information is just useful to have in general, but won't be sufficient
enough to track down specific problems in the kernel. Extending this code
to track all wake ups is beyond the original intention of these
measurements. A method like this only applies to thread of high system
priority with a near RT scheduling class or similar.
