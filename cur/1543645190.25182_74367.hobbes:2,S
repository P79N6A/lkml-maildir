Subject: [PATCH] fix 2.5.39 floppy driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The 2.5.39 floppy driver is still broken. Jens' fix to ll_rw_block
was included in 2.5.39, so the kernel doesn't reboot at the first
I/O operation as it did in 2.5.38, but several problems remain:
1. Accessing /dev/fd0H1440 oopses fs/block_dev.c:do_open().
   Fixed by applying Al Viro's O100-get_gendisk-C38 patch.
2. The capacity of floppies is halved.
   Fixed by applying Al Viro's O101-floppy_sizes-C38 patch.
3. /dev/fd0 size autodetection doesn't work properly. The very
   first read or write only transmits 2K (or 4K with Al's patches)
   of data. I/O works after a reopen of /dev/fd0.
   Explanation: the floppy interrupt handler updates floppy_sizes[],
   but doesn't set_capacity() on the corresponding gendisk, causing
   the detected size for /dev/fd0 to not be applied until the next
   time /dev/fd0 is opened.
   Quick fix: add the missing set_capacity() calls.
   With Al's two patches and this one floppies work reliably for me.
