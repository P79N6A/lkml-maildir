The big problem is that nobody actually knows where all the dependancies
are. That is why I've started with the bits we can decipher so that it
simplifies the mess each time we clean up the locking of some lower level
aspect.
Almost all the serial drivers clone the same open and release methods (or
worse older versions of it) so that also needs doing. Lots to do, so
little time.
