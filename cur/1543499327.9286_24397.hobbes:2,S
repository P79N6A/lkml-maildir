And what about X server or something like this ? Killing it has one disadvantage :
the console stuck in undefined state. So it might be good to send something
other signal than SIGKILL, and after SIGKILL some seconds or like ...
(or detect that a process ignore the first sent signal (SIG_IGN?), and if
so, send SIGKILL for it without any delay).
OK, maybe my knowledge on kernel internals is very limited to find solution
for this problem but killing an X server with SIGKILL is not a very good
solution imho.
Some months ago somebody at our university was talking about implement a user
space process 'guard' daemon with mlock()ed memory which cheks system state,
resource usage per user basis etc etc and sysadm defined actions declared in
a config file for example. Maybe we only need a little kernel interface and
a user mode program to do this task in the right way ?
