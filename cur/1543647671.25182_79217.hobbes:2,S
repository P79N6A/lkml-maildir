Subject: [PATCH] C99 designated initializers for drivers/pcmcia
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi.
My mail to PCMCIA maintainer David Hinds bounces if sent to the
address in the Maintainers file, and the address fished out of
some of the code bounced too, so I'm sending this patch set to
the list in hopes he (or the right maintainer) receives it.
The patches convert drivers/pcmcia to use C99 named initializers,
and all the patches are against 2.5.42. There are 25 patches in
total, and the "cat"ing them together they're more that 20K, so
I'm sending the patches as a compressed attachment. The patches
were CC'd to Linus in the first mail that bounced.
