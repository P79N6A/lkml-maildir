Then use the lowest non-idle priority. The result will not be more b0rken
than nice -n 19.

If you have an rt application, it will block normal tasks like a normal
task will block idle tasks. You need to handle that situation anyway.

Don't do that then. If I ask an idle priority task, I should not expect an
answer unless the system is idle. And besides that, I should not depend on
an answer at all, since the task might be stuck while reading a NFS file
from that smoking and burning server.

As long as IO works correctly while having realtime tasks, there is no
problem, and if it doesn't work, it needs to be fixed anyway.

A very-low-normal-priority tasks would cause all these effects anyway, but
it would do so more frequently.
