Hello.
I am attempting to boot off a Compact Flash device which has a UMSDOS
filesystem.  When I do, I get text that looks like this:
     Partition check:
      hdc: hdc1 hdc2
     .
     .
     hdc: hdc1 hdc2
     hdc: hdc1 hdc2
     fatfs: bogus cluster size
     fatfs: bogus cluster size
     UMSDOS: msdos_read_super failed, mount aborted.
The bootable partion (/dev/hdc1) has a FAT16 filesystem and was created by
MS-DOS v6.2.  The 2nd partition (/dev/hdc2) is a Linux swap partition.  The
kernel itself is loaded by loadlin (not LILO).
This is a snippet of my configuration:
     CONFIG_FAT_FS=y
     CONFIG_MSDOS_FS=y
     CONFIG_UMSDOS_FS=y
     CONFIG_PROC_FS=y
     CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS=y
     CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y
The cluster size on this 128MB disk (a "SanDisk SDCFB-128 ATA DISK drive") is, I
 think, 2048 bytes.
(Of  possible relevance: when I do a "chkdsk" on this device, from either DOS or
Win95, I get a report that the validity cannot be checked because a path name is
illegally  longer  than  67  characters.   I  built  this  drive  by  installing
Slackware's ZipSlack package, then updating to the v2.4.0-test10 kernel.)
So... any thoughts on how to fix this complaint about cluster size?
Thank you.
