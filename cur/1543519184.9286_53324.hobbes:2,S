No, since this is a standalone machine connected via UUCP
to the Internet.

Up 'til 2.3.30, everything went fine, since 2.3.31 something is broken.
2.3.32 is also broken too.
This is an AMD K6/3-400 MHz machine with 256 MB RAM and a 6 GB harddisk,
but the sig 11's also occur on Intel-based systems.
