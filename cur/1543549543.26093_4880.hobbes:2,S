Subject: PATCH 2.2.18.9: Backport /proc/pci from 2.4.x to 2.2.x

The 2.4.x kernel series obtains its /proc/pci device name data from a
data file pci.ids.  The file makes PCI device name generic enough that
it may be used by multiple utilities -- the kernel, Martin Mares'
pciutils, distro installers, etc.  The attached patch, against kernel
2.2.18-pre9, backports the 2.4.x /proc/pci facilities and device name
database.

Note1: This makes your kernel image larger.  Yep.  The -on disk- image. 
The PCI device name data is dropped from the kernel image at runtime, so
there is no penalty.
Note2: This changes the /proc/pci output slightly (to match 2.4.x
output) -- and I think it's worth it.  The new output includes a PCI
region length.
Note3: /proc/bus/pci code is completely untouched.  I think it needs to
be updated to report region length, too.
Enjoy!
