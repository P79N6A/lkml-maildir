As I said quite prominently in the release notes for 2.3.29 for ARM, this is
expected at the moment:

Ingo has a fix for this, and I am currently waiting for him to integrate it
into the kernel; there is no point fixing something twice when it has already
been fixed.  Ingo's fix works well, and have tried to encourage him to forward
them to Linus, but have not received any response to date.
Unfortunately, Ingo's patch affects a number of files, which make it difficult
to manage when his patch goes into the mainstream.  If you're interested, I
could redistribute the patch separately.
