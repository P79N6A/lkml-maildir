Just echo large numbers into both min and max resync speed proc entries:
/proc/sys/dev/raid/spped_limit_max and speed_limit_min
e.g. as root do:
echo 200000 > /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max
echo 200000 > /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min
And watch the speed fly up till it maxes out your hardware.  (-:
The above will set both speeds to 200MiB/s which ought to be more than 
your devices can do...
Best regards,
