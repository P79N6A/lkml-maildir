Not sure what is correct here, but:
evtest /dev/input/event0 produce events for all keys on the keyboard.
Both the normal pc-105 keys, silly extra keys like "favourites", "shopping",
etc., and the wheels.  The "volume" wheel generates VolumeUp and
VolumeDown keypresses (and releases.) The other wheels generates
the same events as the up-arrow and down-arrow keys.
evtest on /dev/input/event1 gives me events from the mouse.
mouse0, mouse1 and mouse2 cannot be used with evtest.
