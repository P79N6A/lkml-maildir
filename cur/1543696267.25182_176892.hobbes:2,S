As said I've tried 2.6.0-test9 [UP, SMP] preemp and SMP non preempt, all with 
the same behaviour, that means immediate machine freeze whenever the usb 
bluetooth dongle is removed from USB port. 
I've also got crashes whenever I've turned off the machine, with bluetooth and 
hci_usb modules loaded.
I've wrote down the message (by hand, so errors are possible) , hoping that 
this can help. If it's possible to get the full message, please let me know, 
a part of it has scrolled out of the screen (i can use a serial port 
terminal, if needed).
here is the trace:

Hope this help,
