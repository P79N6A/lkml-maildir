Good spotting!  This function needs to be passed skb_headlen(skb),
rather than skb->len.  Patch is below (I renamed the parameter as well,
for clarity).
It's fascinating why this "worked".  Firstly, for inter-guest
communication, I am not calculating checksums, nor checking them.
Secondly, for guest->host, I turn off hw checksumming so the kernel
disables SG and this code is never executed.  Thirdly, for virtbench's
inter-guest sendfile test does not check the data received is actually
correct.  Finally, while we end up producing a packet which is larger
than skb->len of 1514, the DMA receive buffer for the other guest is
only 1514 bytes, so the result of the transfer is 1514 (==skb->len), so
no error reported by the driver.

lguest network driver fix: handle scatter-gather packets correctly
Thanks to Herbert Xu for noticing the bug: "len" here is skb_headlen(),
not skb->len.  Renamed the function to clarify, too.
