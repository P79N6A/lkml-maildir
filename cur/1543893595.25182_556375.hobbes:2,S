Yes, they are a bit confusing. Sorry for the bad naming and comments!
The precise meanings can be:
la_index - the time (where we are reading) when the readahead window is established
ra_index - where the readahead window starts
lookahead_index - the time (on reading of which) to push forward the readahead window
readahead_index - where the readahead window ends, or
                  where the next readahead should start with
In normal case, when the readahead window is pushed forward, the
following holds:
                la_index = lookahead_index; lookahead_index = new-value;
                ra_index = readahead_index; readahead_index = new-value;

Both indexes and sizes will be used in the code. So calculates may
always be necessary somewhere. If there's a good naming scheme, either
form(index/size based) is OK to me :)
In fact, there are two kind of windows and one buffer:
                    |---------- readahead window ----------->|                                                          
    ===#============|==================#=====================|                                                          
       |--- reader walking window ---->|--- async buffer --->|        
'lookahead' is not a standard term, while 'readahead_min' may be
confusing for some people?  Anyway, I'd like to propose two more
possible schemes:
	pgoff_t ahead_start;     /* readahead window */
        pgoff_t ahead_end;
	pgoff_t reader_start;    /* on read of which the ahead window was established */
	pgoff_t reader_end;      /* on read of which the ahead window will be pushed forward */
or preferably:
	pgoff_t start;                 /* where readahead started */
        unsigned long size;            /* # of readahead pages */
	unsigned long async_size;      /* do asynchronous readahead when there are only # of pages ahead */
	unsigned long async_size_old;  /* TODO: this one is not needed for now */
Any opinions? Thanks.

Yes, if we are to re-introduce the adaptive readahead, the functions
will be reused.
Thank you,
