I tried it on my dual P3 box with the VIA chipset and I'm definitely
getting timeouts for the USB devices. Booting with "noapic" resolves the
problem for me. Output of lspci for the VIA stuff is:
00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C691 [Apollo PRO] (rev
c4)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C598 [Apollo MVP3 AGP]
00:07.0 ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C596 ISA [Apollo PRO]
(rev 23)
00:07.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586 IDE [Apollo] (rev
10)
00:07.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B USB (rev 11)
00:07.3 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc.: Unknown device 3050 (rev
30)
The motherboard is a Tyan Tiger 133 (slot 1).
I'd be happy to provide more info, just tell me what you need.
Thanks,
John
