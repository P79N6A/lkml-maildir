Isn't typecheck() supposed to be defined in kernel.h which is included
_everywhere_ ?
Hrm, I see, dependency from kernel.h on bitops.h on asm/bitops.h on
asm/system.h.

I did this cmpxchg_local patchset to support Christoph Lameter's slub
performance improvement work. It implies touching every kernel
architecture. Each architecture is touched by a different patch. And no,
I did not happen to have an FRV toolchain handy. Sorry. I'll dig into
this.
