It's not about source routing.  It's about failover and being
able to use ARP on interfaces which don't have addresses assigned
to them yet.

Decisions about Networking will always be in a different domain
because the way one behaves has effects upon other systems not
just the local one.
BTW, another thing which makes the source address selection for
outgoing ARPs a real touchy area is the following.  Some weird
configurations actually respond with different ARP answers based upon
the source address in the ARP request.  You can ask Julian Anastasov
about such (arguably pathological) setups.
