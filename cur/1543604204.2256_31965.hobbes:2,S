It seems that any Athlon (even Durons) work fine in SMP configurations. 
(Although I don't recommend this for stability).
Most people using dual Athlons are probably using the higher speed but
cheaper Athlon parts with no problem.
I have heard conflicting reports of what is actually different about the
MP vs non-MP parts, with points ranging from "the MP parts are just
certified" to that MP actually has some different internals.  Whatever
the case, I suppose the difference isn't earth-shattering and mostly
marketing (ala Intel).
