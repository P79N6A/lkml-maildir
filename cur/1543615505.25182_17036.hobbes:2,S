It used to be necessary on the IBM 830 CDROM but I think those have fallen
into disrepair and have undergone many changes.  The 830's likely need that
still but probably can't boot for other reasons now, though.
} Is the hdx=bswap or hdx=swapdata option actually in use?
} When is it needed?
} The current implementation can cause data corruptions on SMP with PIO 
} transfers:
} It modifies the source buffer during disk writes, and these temporary
} modifications (within the irq handler) are visible with mmap on SMP.
} 
} Is it possible to remove the option entirely, or should it be fixed?
