Subject: [PATCH 0/22] /dev/random: Assorted fixes and cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/25/213

This is a collection of fixes and cleanups for the Linux /dev/random
driver including:
- more robust/correct entropy accounting and reseed logic
- starvation avoidance for simultaneous /dev/random and /dev/urandom
  users
- remove entropy batching
- wakeup bug fix
- remove various legacy code
- remove i386isms
I've broken this into a bunch of very simple bits, so I'm afraid the
patch count is rather high by non-gregkh standards.
These patches have been tested by various people since pre-2.6.0 and
have been in my -tiny tree since its inception. Andrew, please queue
these in -mm for wider testing/review.
