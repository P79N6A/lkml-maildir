The problem is also that Linux has a non-premptable kernel. So when a low priority task does, for 
example, a long write, it will own the system until it runs out of buffers or until the write is done.
The best that the rt code can do is to improve the priority of the soft rt process and force linux to
do a reschedule at the next resched point. It is also, perhaps, possible for us to have pure user code
modules associated with a process that would be run immediately, but I don't think this would be nice.
