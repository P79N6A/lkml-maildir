Ironically, the very same problem now exists with the USB mass-storage 
driver.  I don't see any way for the driver itself to solve it, 
especially during a hibernation (which can be a _very_ deep sleep).
One thing that could be done is for filesystems to verify, after a 
system sleep, that their superblocks haven't changed.  There could 
still be issues with non-mounted partitions, if they have live entries 
in the block cache, but it would be an improvement.
Do you know the right people to mention this to?  Anybody in filesystem 
development interested in suspend/hibernation issues?
