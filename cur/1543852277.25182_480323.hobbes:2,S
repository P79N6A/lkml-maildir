The act of reading from /proc/kmsg alters the state of the ring buffer.
This is not the same as smth like dmesg, which simply dumps the messages.
That's why only getting current size and dumping are treated as
less-privileged.

SELinux doesn't distinguish the entrypoint to the ringbuffer,
so this patch would break its current behaviour.
