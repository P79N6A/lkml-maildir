Do you happen to have a Rev. B1 DLink adapter?  If so, the only change
that was put in (PHY Select fix) should actually make these devices
work.  Can you check the top of the ax88772_bind() call in your file and
see if it has this bit:
        if ((ret = asix_write_cmd(dev, AX_CMD_SW_PHY_SELECT,
                                1, 0, 0, buf)) < 0) {
                dbg("Select PHY #1 failed: %d", ret);
                goto out2;
        }
That '1' after the AX_CMD_SW_PHY_SELECT was the key to that patch.  If
yours is 1, you could try setting it to 0, though that should make
things not work.  I'd very interested if it made things work for you.
BTW, the ramifications of this bug were similar to what you describe:
the interface would come up, look fine but just wouldn't send or receive
any packets. The hard lock-ups and such are likely from something else.
