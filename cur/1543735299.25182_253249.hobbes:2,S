I think we want a solution that works well for both cases.
E.g., we have a few different needs:
	- Stuff like Spotlight-esque automatic Indexers.
	- File manager notifications
	- Other GUI notifications (desktop, menus, etc.)
	- To prevent polling (e.g. /proc/mtab)
	- Existing dnotify users
dnotify is pretty lame for any of the above situations.  Even for
something as trivial as watching the current open directory in Nautilus,
look at the hoops we have to just through with FAM.
And dnotify utterly falls apart on removable media or for any "large"
sort of job, e.g. indexing.
