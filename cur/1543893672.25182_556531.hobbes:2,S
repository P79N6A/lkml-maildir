Ok, so color me confused, and maybe I have missed some of the emails or 
skimmed over them too fast (there's been too many of them ;), but
 - I haven't actually seen any traces for this (netconsole apparently 
   doesn't work for you, and I'm not surprised: it never really worked 
   well for me over suspend/resume either, but I think I saw a mention of 
   serial console?)
 - You apparently bisected it down to the range
	0a3fd051c7036ef71b58863f8e5da7c3dabd9d3f <- works
	1d30c33d8d07868199560b24f10ed6280e78a89c <- breaks
   but some of the intermediates in that range didn't compile. Correct?
Can you try to bisect down a bit more, despite the compile error? Just do
	git bisect start
	git bisect good 0a3fd051c7036ef71b58863f8e5da7c3dabd9d3f
	git bisect bad 1d30c33d8d07868199560b24f10ed6280e78a89c
and it should pick 
	f4d6d004: libata: ignore EH scheduling during initialization
for you to test. It will apparently break on the fact that "sata_via.c" 
wants "ata_scsi_device_resume/suspend" for the initialization of the
resume/suspend things in the scsi_host_template, but you should just 
remove those lines, and the compile hopefully completes cleanly after 
that.
IOW, it *should* be easy enough to pinpoint this from 9 changes down to 
just one.
Jeff added to the Cc, since he may not have noticed that one of the most 
long-running issues is apparently sata-related.
(Jeff: David Greaves _also_ had issues with -rc4 due to the SETFXSR 
change, but that should hopefully be resolved and is presumably an 
independent bug. Apart from the fact that "sata_via.c" seems problematic)
