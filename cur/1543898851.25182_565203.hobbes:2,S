Could you motivate this part better?  It is not covered in the
documentation patch.
It seems to be a way of having a marker handling (callback) module
give alternate names/ids to markers.  If so, why, considering that
there is already a private void* callback parameter available to pass
data back to itself through?
Also, what if different marker handling modules want to set different
id/group numbers on the same set of markers?
