   instead of:
		   current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
   +               mb();
   shouldnt we do:
   +		xchgl(&current->state, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
   This 'merges' the barrier and the write. Or rather, in asm-i386 we could
   do something like: 
   #define set_mb(addr,val) xchgl(addr,val)
   and then use set_barrier().
Sure, but it costs ~8 instructions instead of 2 on ll/sc architectures.
