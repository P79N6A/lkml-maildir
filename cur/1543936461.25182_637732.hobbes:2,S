I have what I believe to be the released version of PCI-X 2.0a (July
22, 2003).  It is quite clear that Mode 2 devices (ie those running at
266MHz or 533MHz) are required to support all 4096 bytes of extended
config space.
More to the point, I don't think we have any bug reports suggesting that
PCI-X Mode 2 devices/bridges have any problems.  There are relatively
few of them in existance, and my impression is that PCI-X2 is only being
implemented on server-class machines.  'Consumer grade' equipment is
where all the problems lie anyway.
While the PCI-X 2.0a spec does not define any Extended Capability IDs,
it simply states that "This field is a PCI-SIG defined ID number that
indicates the nature and format of the Extended Capabilities List item".
The PCIe spec does define Extended Capability IDs, and I would think
it's entirely appropriate to use the same IDs for PCI-X Mode 2 devices.
So I don't believe any change in this area is appropriate.
