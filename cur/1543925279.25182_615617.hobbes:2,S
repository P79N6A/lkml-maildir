This #ifdef'd code in unionfs is actually not enabled.  I left it there as a
reminder of possible future things to come (esp. if nameidata gets split).
There's a related comment earlier in fs/unionfs/lookup.c:init_lower_nd()
that says:
#ifdef ALLOC_LOWER_ND_FILE
	/*
	 * XXX: one day we may need to have the lower return an open file
	 * for us.  It is not needed in 2.6.23-rc1 for nfs2/nfs3, but may
	 * very well be needed for nfs4.
	 */
	struct file *file;
#endif /* ALLOC_LOWER_ND_FILE */
In the interest of keeping unionfs as simple as I can, when I implemented
the whole "pass a lower nd" stuff, I left thos bits of semi-experimental
#ifdef code for this lower file upon open-intent.  It's not enabled and up
until now, it didn't seem to be needed.
Do you think unionfs has to start using this nd->intent.open.file stuff?
Thanks,
Erez.
