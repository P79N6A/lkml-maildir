OK thanks. But I am sorry to push you once more, Trond: can you now give
me just a brief explanation of difference between the "wsize" option and
the "wtmult" attribute? Is it better now to disable O_DIRECT and use a
larger wsize/rsize, or to enable it and be content with the parameters it
uses?
(Sorry, I have got myself only a vague idea of the answer, but I am not so
expert in all this I/O stuff and its different layers.)
Many thanks and best regards.
Oliver
