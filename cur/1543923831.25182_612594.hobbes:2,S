However, how beautiful the implementation of static void remove_files()
and static int create_files() looks doesn't matter.  What's important is
that
 struct attribute_group {
 	const char		*name;
+	int			(*is_visible)(struct kobject *,
+					      struct attribute *, int);
 	struct attribute	**attrs;
 };
makes sense to users --- because this is the API.
[BTW, like most of the existing driver core APIs, there are kerneldoc
comments missing here.]

Here you have a point.  But James has a point too when he says:
| We basically want to show capability by which file is present.
Anyway, /if/ the reverse logic is preferred, it shouldn't be called
"mask_out()" but rather "is_masked()" or "is_hidden()" or the like.
