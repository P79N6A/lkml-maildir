Well, sorry for that, but my point was that without enabling
CONFIG_DRV_RTC_CMOS and only using CONFIG_RTC, my dmesg says :
drivers/rtc/hctosys.c: unable to open rtc device (rtc0)
Having seem that, I got thru all the options, trying to find what I
could have forgot as an option, and added the RTC_CMOS one, that resulted
in an Oops...

Good ;)

OK, ready to test !

It seems to me that the DRV_RTC_CMOS and the "standard" CONFIG_RTC
shouldn't be used at the same time... Am I correct on that ? 
Wouldn't it be better to have this dependancy enforced ?
