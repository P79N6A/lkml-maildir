Wrong. Edit a header adding a new type T. Later change an existing file
that already includes said header to use T. Change a function, fix most
uses. Find a wrong usage later and fix it separately. Change something, fix
its Documentation/ later. Note how you can come up with dependent changes
that _can't_ be detected automatically.
