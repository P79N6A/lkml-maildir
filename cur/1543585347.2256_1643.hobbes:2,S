In as much as several people did point out that a write is not guaranteed to
be complete and may be short, even when in blocking mode, you are perfectly
correct.  In as much as this usually is a result of an error condition or
inability of the write to be completed, and not a result of a driver refusing
to block and complete the write as the caller has requested (which would be
the case in a sound driver since the output should be draining, the only
exception being if the program had call the SETTRIGGER ioctl to disable the
output starting with the first write of a complete oss frag, which esd doesn't
do so it isn't a plausible condition) I think drivers that do this are
"inferior" (since I can't call them buggy any longer).  Amongst other things,
it increases the number of traversals through the syscall heirarchy
needlessly, wastes both kernel and user space CPU cycles, and negates the
whole purpose of having the file opened in blocking mode anyway.  So, yes esd
should check these conditions to be complete and compliant with specs.  Given
a decent sound driver though, it shouldn't have to.
