False, it can't be a write request if there's no data attached. Write is
simply used there because read requests are usually more precious.

The bug was in the SCSI layer, and James already has the fix integrated
for that. It really should make 2.6.15, James are you sending it upwards
for that?

Do this in the eject tool, if it's required for some devices.
