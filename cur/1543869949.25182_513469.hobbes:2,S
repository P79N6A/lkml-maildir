Deadline shows this:
sync:
READ: io=1,024MiB, aggrb=38,212KiB/s, minb=38,212KiB/s,
maxb=38,212KiB/s, mint=28099msec, maxt=28099msec
libaio:
READ: io=1,024MiB, aggrb=37,933KiB/s, minb=37,933KiB/s,
maxb=37,933KiB/s, mint=28306msec, maxt=28306msec
syslet-rw:
READ: io=1,024MiB, aggrb=34,759KiB/s, minb=34,759KiB/s,
maxb=34,759KiB/s, mint=30891msec, maxt=30891msec
There were about 10k async schedulings.
