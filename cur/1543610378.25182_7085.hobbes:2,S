Ummh. I'm doing successive runs for /dev/md0 GB at a time, and it seems to
get corrupted in the middle:
#!/usr/bin/perl
for ($i = 0; $i < 75; $i++)
{
   $block = 1024**2;
   $count = 1024;
   $| = 1;
   print "At $i GB\n";
   
   system "(dd if=/dev/md0 bs=$block count=$count skip=".($i*$count).
          "| md5sum) 2>&1";
}
diff -c on (modified) output:

(... still running)
I'm puzzled as to why this happens, since (as said) hde and hdg both md5sum
quite ok. Raid stuff, I gather, should be fairly solid, no?
