You are hitting the BUG_ON() in line 909, whereas Mathieu was hitting
something further up in the same routine.
However I agree that they look suspicious. Both look as if something is
corrupting the rpc_task structure. In your case, a debugging tag that is
only ever touched by the RPC code at the very start and very finish of
the call is being changed, which points at something like a
use-after-free issue.
Hmm... I note that you are both running with the SLUB allocator. Any
chance you can reproduce using SLAB (and with the SLAB debugging
enabled)?
