Write an application that creates 2 sockets listening on the same port
but different interfaces (using the SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option, see
the dhcp source for an example). Then forward any packet you receive
on one socket to the other side. If you need to keep the source ip
intact, you may have to use a raw socket for the sending part.
You could adapt a DHCP relay program to do this stuff instead of
writing it from scratch.
