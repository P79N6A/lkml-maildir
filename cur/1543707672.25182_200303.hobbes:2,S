It is difficult to propogate the SD_FLAG_IDLE attribute up
multiple domains.
For example, with SMT + CPU + NODE domains you can get into
the following situation:
01, 23 are 4 siblings in 2 cores on node 0,
45, 67 are " " " on node 1.
The top level balancing domain now spans 01234567, and wants to
balance between groups 0123, and 4567. We don't want SD_FLAG_IDLE
semantics here, because that would mean if two tasks were running
on node 0, one would be migrated to node 1. We want to migrate 1
task if one node is idle, and the other has 3 processes running for
example.
Also this copes with siblings becoming much more powerful, or
some groups with SMT turned off, some on (think hotplug cpu),
different speed CPUs, etc.
