Neither am/was I. The rsync is within a single FS.
Aside from that, here is the original bug report by Matthias 
Schniedermeyer: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=98157768131423&w=2
with no reply.
My report:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=98262067309185&w=2
with myself replying :) 
Russell King's report: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=98326853429463&w=2
which gave a fair amount of discussion.
Note that in my report I state that the problem cannot be seen
with smaller workloads; I have to try with at least drivers/*
before it shows itself. Hmm, just tried with 243-ac12 (yeah,
I'm way behind). I have to try the full tree now, drivers/*
wont do it anymore.
