Well, it will need to be huge_ptep_get_and_clear() below, not the
normal version.  But pte_modify should be ok.  I'm not sure
pte_present() is safe, either, !pte_none() is what we use elsewhere in
hugetlb.c.
And.. looks like lazy_mmu_prot_update() is unsafe, too.  The only arch
which has something here (ia64) has a function which does icache
flushes on PAGE_SIZE only.
