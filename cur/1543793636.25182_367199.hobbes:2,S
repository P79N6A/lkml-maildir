Yes, if you don't have real negative cookies, then just use NULL.
Think of malloc(). It doesn't return MALLOC_OUT_OF_MEMORY_COOKIE when it 
won't give you any more memory. It returns NULL.
The advantage of NULL is that people know what it is, and that the C 
language _defines_ that you can do "if (xyzzy)" to test for non-NULL. 
Conversely, the disadvantage of using a special cookie (that just happens 
to be NULL) is that the test for NULL still _works_, so now you have two 
ways of doing something and the compiler will never warn.
So in a very real sense, NULL _always_ exists. You can't make it go away 
by defining it to another name, and by using another name you just confuse 
things (if they are in fact the same).
