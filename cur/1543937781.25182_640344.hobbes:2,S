That's much saner than dup'ing up the early ioremap stuff to support
both PAE and non-PAE at runtime, which is about the only idea I've got
for fixing this right now...
I think I'll just back out the early_ioremap patches locally for now and
wait for Eric's patches which should cause the fix for this issue to
just fall out in the wash.
