B isn't quite typeless. It has minimal inbuilt support for concepts like
strings (although you can of course multiply a string by an array
pointer ;))
It also had some elegances that C lost, notably 
	case 1..5:
the ability to do no zero biased arrays
	x[40];
	x-=10;
and the ability to reassign function names.
	printk = wombat;
as well as stuff like free(function);
