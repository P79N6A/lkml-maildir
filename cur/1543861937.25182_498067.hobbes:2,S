Here are some numbers. My test program measures the latency of pthread_broadcast 
with 1000 pthreads (all threads are blocked on pthread_cond_wait, the time is 
measured between the broadcast call and the last woken pthread).
Here are the average latencies after 5000 measures.
[only this patch is used, not the following.
  The system is a dual Xeon 2.80GHz with HT enable]
First case: all threads are SCHED_OTHER
* with simple list:
Iterations=5000
Latency (us)      min      max      avg      stddev
                  3869     7400  6656.73      539.35
* with plist:
Iterations=5000
Latency (us)      min      max      avg      stddev
                  3684     7629  6787.97      479.41
Second case: all threads are SCHED_FIFO with priority equally distributed from 
priomin to priomax
* with simple list:
Iterations=5000
Latency (us)      min      max      avg      stddev
                  4548     7197  6656.85      463.30
* with plist:
Iterations=5000
Latency (us)      min      max      avg      stddev
                  8289    11752  9720.12      426.45
So, yes it (logically) has a cost, depending of the number of different 
priorities used, so it's specially measurable with real-time threads.
With SCHED_OTHER, I suppose that the priorities are not be very distributed.
May be, supposing it makes sense to respect the priority order only for 
real-time pthreads, I can register all SCHED_OTHER threads to the same 
MAX_RT_PRIO priotity ?
Or do you think this must be set behind a CONFIG* option ?
(Or finally not interesting enough for mainline ?)
