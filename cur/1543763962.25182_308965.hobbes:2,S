what seems to be currently missing is distro level support for using
firmware for modules needed for booting (and tg3 falls sort of under
that via nfsroot) and widespread easy availability of firmware in
distros and for users.
Both are a bit of a chick-and-egg thing, and this is what a transition
period with a few key drivers in dual-mode would hopefully resolve.
One of the options is to even ship the firmware in the kernel tarbal but
from a separate directory with a clear license clarification text in it.
