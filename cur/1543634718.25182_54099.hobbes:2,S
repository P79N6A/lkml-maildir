You do not have to go so far. Take a simple cluster of dual Xeon boxes (ie, 
4 'cpus' per box). Current clustering software (MPI, PVM) is not ready to
handle a 2-level hierarchy, one with slow communications over tcp and a lower
level working as a shared-memory thread-able cluster.
It would not be so strange nowadays (nor too much expensive) to have a 8-16
nodes with 4 cpus each.
