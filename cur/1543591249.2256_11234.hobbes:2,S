Hello
I have been trying to get 2.4.x to boot on my machine for sometime. I
finally got ac9 to boot today but I had to change the Processor Opts
from Athlon/K7/etc to PII/Celeron. I am running on an Iwill KK266 board
with a duron 800, 384 megs of RAM, SB Live X-Gamer, Adaptec 2910 and
2940UW, tnt2, and linksys Etherfast 10/100 nic. I run Debian sid. I
have been running 2.2.19 for sometime with no troubles. 2.4.x with k7
opts always would opps out while runing rcS scripts and never would get
past single user.
