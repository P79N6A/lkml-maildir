Thanks for the great feedback Daniel!
Following this email, I'll be sending out two separate emails with the
actual patches, one against the latest stable kernel and one against
the latest mm patch, using the format suggested by you. Sorry about
the tabs and spaces thing, I've fixed my email client now.
Thanks for pointing out problems with the (free_blocks <= 0)
expression, I totally agree with you and have fixed it in the new
patch. Regarding some of the other points that you raised:
1. Worse performance with random read on large files using metaclustering:
This is a genuine drawback of this kind of metaclustering. In short,
the choice is between a slightly slower random read or a much faster
fsck. However, I believe that going forward, especially if and when we
port metaclustering to Ext4, slower random read will probably be less
of an issue, since there'll be fewer indirect blocks (due to the use
of extents) and so we'll be able to do more aggressive prefetching of
indirect blocks to help random reads.
That said, it would be great to see what random read performance other
users report since in my own experiments the degradation has been
somewhat smaller than I'd expect (I've also tried more complex random
read non-standard benchmarks that I haven't reported numbers for and
they did "reasonably ok" with metaclustering, but of course standard
reproducible results are always better).
2. Porting to Ext4:
It seems that popular opinion is that some form of metaclustering
could be useful for Ext4 as some other Ext4 hackers have also
suggested the same on LKML and I'd be glad to work on it. However, I
think metaclustering provides genuine value to current users of Ext3
and Ext2 and most people will agree that these two file systems are
very likely to remain popular for quite some time now (the backport of
metaclustering to Ext2 is quite trivial, so if metaclustering gets
accepted in Ext3, I'll probably release a "use-at-your-own-risk" patch
for Ext2 users).
Thanks!
