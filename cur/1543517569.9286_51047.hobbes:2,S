I was referring to the abstract machine in the ISO C standard. It has
nothing to say about SMP or multi-threading. The nearest it gets is in
describing volatile.

For a volatile x, the significant point is that there is a read from
the object designated by x, followed by a write to the same object.
An implementation will use temporaries, but those temporaries have a
shadowy existence. 'x += 1' is equivalent to 'x = x + 1', but the
expression 'x + 1' is not an lvalue, so does not designate an object,
volatile or otherwise.

Certainly not by the standard.
It might seem like I'm harping on about the C standard. It's not
directly relevant to gcc as it is used in kernel programming, but it
does constrain the gcc developers, so it can be useful for predicting
the current and future behaviour of gcc, and reasonable C compilers in
general.
