I honestly beleive that your simply out of luck, not that 3 years is
alot for a laptop, but simply the "shit happens" thing.
Even though the Distro you run is tagged "Unstable" I'd rather run a
battery of stress tools on your computer it before posting here, 'cus
it's maybe a bit beyond the scope of lkml (I bet you tried more than one
versions of the kernel in 3 years, problems never remain too long, I
also hope you tried fresh installs too).
I don't think that en Inspiron 8100 carries anything exotic, so ...
well... Go for a memtest86 then try disk stress tools (my memory wen't
blank right now, ask google ;-) )
JB,
