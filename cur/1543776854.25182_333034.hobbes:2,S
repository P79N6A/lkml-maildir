Ok, I'll go through and fix any coding style problems.  I've only seen
older versions of this same patch, but if there is a better way I'd love
to hear it.  I'll google around a little more just in case.

Actually, this is one of the metholds listed in video.txt. Take a look
at #7 ;-).  I just tried acpi_sleep=s3_bios to see what that does, but
just caused an instant reboot on resume.  The only other solutions that
works is to disable the frame buffer and use X or some other app to do
the job as listed in #5 and #6, but something in kernel like this patch
is required to be able to use the framebuffer.

Ok, I'll try it without. I don't know if it's needed or not, that code
is untouched from Ole Rohne's origional version.
