You're both being silly.  The point is not mp3 skips per year, the point is:
is anything less than perfection tolerable, when you know perfection is within
reach?  If it helps, forget I ever said 'mp3' and think 'signal processing'
instead.
I'll go further and say we need realtime processing in our desktops, not
only for signal processing but for more mundane things like moving the mouse
cursor smoothly (yes, this is another item that sucks in Linux).  Sorry, I'm
a perfectionist, and I like precision.  If you're not and you don't, just
say so, and we'll understand each other perfectly.
OK, I'm done with the 'do we really need realtime' FAQ item.
