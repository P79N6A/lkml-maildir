Subject: iso9660 r/w not implemented?

I've mounted an iso image:
/auto/sda2/tmp/cd/cd1/image1.raw on /mnt type iso9660 (rw,loop=/dev/loop0)
but operations on files inside the image give "Read-only file system"
notices. Was iso9660 assumed never to be r/w, or was that part not implemented
yet, or is there some reason mount says it's rw, but there's really some
extra step to get it read-write..
Thanks
