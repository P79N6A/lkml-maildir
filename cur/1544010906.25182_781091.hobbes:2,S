Forgive me, but you don't seem to really be taking it on board here
either ...  what it SAYS to an english reader is the opposite of what
you intend it to MEAN, unfortunately :(.
So the name is wrong. It's simple to fix. Just change the name. The
simplest naming fix is from
    time_is_after_jiffies(foo)
to
    time_is_before_jiffies(foo)
but obviously that would create more confusion yet, given the
unfortunate current scheme!  So how about keeping the current macro
names but gradually phasing them out in favour of a parallel set of 
alternatives, which could be
    current_time_is_before_jiffies(foo)
?? That reads fine in english and this time it means what it says!
Best regards
Peter
