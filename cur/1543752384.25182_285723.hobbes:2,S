It means that the VFS failed to register the lock that was just granted
to you because of a combination of an RPC race (the reply telling you
the lock was granted arrived before the previous lock holder has been
notified that his lock was freed), and the user pressing ^C at the wrong
moment.
You may have an "orphaned lock" on the server.

<shrug>My fs/nfs/file.c looks very much like the one in vanilla
2.6.11-rc1. See Linus' changelog for what may be missing.</shrug>
