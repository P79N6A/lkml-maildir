I did not say "ignore". Having the new interface available (patches 1-3)
seems to be a sensible thing to do. Removing the so-called "old" api
(patches 4-x) is a different topic, though.

However, you need to do it in _addition_ -- you don't get it "for free" if
using struct class. Which means prgrammers need to think of two things
instead of one. And that's bad(TM).
Also, the lack of proper reference counting in several parts of the kernel
is proof enough that there's need to "encourage" reference counting. And
that's something the class subsystem did and does by providing easy
"embedded" reference counting, by warning on missing !release functions etc.

Indeed, such _workarounds_ are possible. A patch which converts pcmcia to
this new infrastructure would be quite trivial to write. However: I think we
should NOT do it. As it is a workaround to the more elegant solution the
"old" class API alllowed for.

Math is hard, so let's go shopping. The "I want a /dev-entry"-api may get 
easier with your patches 1-3. With your patch 4 there is no improvement in
this area, however the "I want sane device-related reference counting"-api
will be much more difficult to get right.
Thanks,
