I'm sorry :). It helps to make one line per call only, since this
allows changing the printk internals for the better by reducing some
complexity. I believe this is a good thing. I have a patch that
changes printk, but it assumes that each format string only contains a
single line. Is this a very bad assumption to make? Or maybe I should
have sent that change first and made a reference to it?
But don't you also agree, on the grounds of principle, that a single
line per call is better style?
