Hello Eric,

I tried these patches on an i386 box with kexec-tools-1.99. 
kexec-ing with vmlinux works fine but bzImage still doesnt 
go through. Is there a newer kexec-tools package that we 
need to use this with (to take care of the "purgatory code 
getting overwritten" problem you had identified).
Regards, Hari
