Hi,
its definitly an X problem.
i ran into similar probs with radeons and rage128s... and seemed to be the 
same with different kernels.
Debian unstable contains a fix for that behaviour, but I don't know about RH 
7.x and 8.x:
A temporary fix would be disabling drm.
....
Debian changelog:
xfree86 (4.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low
   * patch #000_post421: resynced with xf-4_2-branch as of 2002-10-06
     + Xdm patches: realloc usage, zero malloc()ated memory, enable
       /dev/urandom on NetBSD 1.4 and later (#5345, Mike A. Harris, #5401,
       Matthias Scheler) (Matthieu Herrb)
     + Fix crash in the TextWidget reported by Hans Wilmer. The bug is fixed in
       the TextAction.c patch (actually it was fixed in head, but I forgot to
       update the 4.2 branch, that is what most people are using).  Also synced
       some other bug fixes only in CVS head.  (Paulo Cesar Pereira de Andrade)
   * patch #002: resynced with xf-4_2-branch updates
   * patch #024: new; fix for hangs upon VT switch back to XFree86 on Rage128
     and Radeon cards due to failure to set and reset PCI busmastering properly
     (thanks, Michel Dänzer) (Closes: #163359)
