OK but I haven't understood this:
The ret_from_sys_call is called also at the end of a slow interrupt, and the
timer handler is a slow interrupt.
So if the timer interrupt interrupts a process during a system call it marks
its bottom half and if no other interrupt was active the slow interrupt calls
ret_from_system_call. At this time the timer bottom half are executed, and if
updating the current process do need_resched = 1 what prevent the process to
be rescheduled some istruction below ?
