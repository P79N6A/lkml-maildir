I think since its a reproducible problem, I think it's easiest to get 
you straight to git-bisect.  In this case, that would be
1. Clone branch "upstream" of 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git
2. Test.  If bug persists, you have narrowed down the problem to the -mm 
changes from the SATA developers, that are to be sent for 2.6.24.  If 
the problem does not persist, then it's a problem added in the -mm 
patchset alone, which carries few ATA patches outside of libata-dev.git.
3. If the problem is in libata-dev.git#upstream (likely), you can now 
use git-bisect to find the specific commit that causes the problems. 
Read the git-bisect man page for full details, but the basics are
	a) start with a known good point (v2.6.22? v2.6.23?) and
	known bad point (HEAD, aka the most recent commit in
	libata-dev.git#upstream)
	b) build and boot kernels, marking each as known-good or
	known-bad.
	c) This process will systematically narrow down the problem
	to a single git commit.

	Jeff
