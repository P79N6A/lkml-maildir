OK, so any suggestions for what I should try?
My most recent panic on boot ended with:
DWARF2 unwinder tack at 0xc0100199
Leftover inexact backtrace:
 =======================
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging requets at virtual address 0000b034
 printing eip:
c0103712
*pde = 00000000
Recursive die() failure, output suppressed
 <0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
Taking a look at an "objdump -d vmlinux", that c0103712 is in
show_trace_log_lvl():

It looks like that's the deference of context on line 221:
		stack = (unsigned long*)context->previous_esp;
So "context" was 0000b000?? OK, I don't know this code at all, so I'm
probably not going to figure out anything useful here.
