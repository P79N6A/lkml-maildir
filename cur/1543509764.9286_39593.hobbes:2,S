Should have mentioned that I checked that. According to the strace,
SO_LINGER hasn't been set or unset on that file descriptor (curiously, it
had been set on a previous socket from the same IP and with the same file
descriptor number).
Even where the LINGER was set (elsewhere in the code) it was set to 120
(units - seconds? - claims to be hundreths of seconds in the setsockopt
man page but I think that's wrong).  In the problem that I demonstrated,
close took 11 minutes to return! 
I'm tempted to comment out the only SO_LINGER entry in BIND (it doesn't
seem to be needed) to see it help - I'm not sure.
