Exactly what I was thinking.
The kernel cannot be expected to cater to applications or make
concessions (read: hacks) for certain behavior.  If we offer a cleaner,
improved interface which offers the performance improvement, we are
done.  Applications need to start using it.
Of course, I am not arguing against optimizing the old interfaces or
anything of that nature.  I just believe we should not introduce hacks
for application behavior.  It is their job to do the right thing.
