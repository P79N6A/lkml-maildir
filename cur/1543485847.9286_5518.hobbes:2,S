Right ! Now I found some problem with modutils so I write some own C
code to handle modules instead of nowdays-buggy-modutils. (and I wanted
to learn something with this task)
If modultils switch into C++ I'm continuing coding my own utils
to handle modules for myself since C++ ugly and we've got many diskless
and low memory client without any extra c++ lib or something similar.
