   Almost all (maybe 100%) modern hardware has context ids in the TLB.
Unfortunately, the cpu with the largest market share, x86, does not.
So if you aren't context switching between threads sharing the same
address space, the whole TLB is in fact flushed.
But other than x86, I cannot think of any other cpu in use today which
does not have TLB context ids.
