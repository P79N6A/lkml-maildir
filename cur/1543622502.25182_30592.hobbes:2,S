Some recent jam patchsets next to -aa at:
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/jam.html
There is a lot of common code in the kernels tested, but there are
a few notables:
-aa about 30% faster on the Open Source Database Benchmark
-aa 10-20% faster on tests involving lots of forks.
-jams about 15% faster on tbench
Lots of variation in tiobench.
The tiobench numbers are the most intriguing.  
Hoping someone can make sense of them.
