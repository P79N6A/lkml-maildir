I'll send an email to the resnet people seeing if they can login to the
hubs and get some kind of stats to fidn out if there is a general
problem with collisions...

Well...I tried...
ifdown eth0;rmmod linuxfet;modprobe via-rhine;ifup eth0 and it worked
fine for a minute. 
Then I went to switch back to linuxfet. somehow both modules got loaded
at the same time, rmmod'd them both and when I did ifup eth0 again it
locked up.
So I'm back to a 0 uptime using linuxfet again...I'll have to repatch
and build via-rhine...
one thing that I have noticed is that it only ever gets the 
"The PCI BIOS has not enabled the device at 0/144!  Updating PCI command 
0003->0007."
after via-rhine stops working and I load linuxfet.
