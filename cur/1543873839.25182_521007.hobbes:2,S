Are there some debug hooks that can be activated?  My sky2 stops
responding (very light load) about twice a day.  The netdev watchdog
notices after a while and is able to reactivate the interface:
Mar 15 13:28:12 btd kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Mar 15 13:28:12 btd kernel: sky2 eth0: tx timeout
Mar 15 13:28:12 btd kernel: sky2 eth0: transmit ring 458 .. 435 report=458 done=458
Mar 15 13:28:12 btd kernel: sky2 eth0: disabling interface
Mar 15 13:28:12 btd kernel: sky2 eth0: enabling interface
Mar 15 13:28:12 btd kernel: sky2 eth0: ram buffer 48K
Mar 15 13:28:15 btd kernel: sky2 eth0: Link is up at 1000 Mbps, full duplex, flow control both
This machine is a Core2 Duo e6700, and the interface is:
03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8053 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 20)
to 1 Gb hub.
On a Pentium 4, with:
02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8053 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 15)
I have no issues, but with a very light network load, 100 Mb/s hub..
Each machine has two identical interfaces; only one has a cable in it.
Both machines can be used for testing/debug.
