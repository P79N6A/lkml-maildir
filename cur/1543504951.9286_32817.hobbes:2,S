And here is the test code.
I made one typo in my previous mail. I wrote:
> Only one non realtime signal can be in the signal queue at a time
This is not true. Only one siginfo per non realtime signal is what I meant.
The code is also available from 
http://www.rhdv.cistron.nl/posix.html
 in case
it doesn't get through vger in one piece. The patch is also there.
