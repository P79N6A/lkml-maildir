Ok, I've got now got open(dir);fsync(dir);close(dir) after my
rename,unlink, and link calls.
Now, I need to know when its needed, and when it isn't allowed!
I seem to recall that newer Reiserfs wouldn't need it, is that true?
and if so, at what level?.
How about xfs, jfs, etc ?
I also seem to recall discussion that some of this might wind up
supported in VFS?
Lastly, I just received an error report from a user who is getting
fsync(dir) errors on an NFS mounted directory ?!?!?
