Hardly. If people send me anything threatening via email, legal or
otherwise, they have already kissed any form of 'etiquette' goodbye
and can expect it to show up on the web promptly. And yes, what Larry
wrote to Pavel certainly had an implied threat of legal action,
whether or not he had any sort of case.
