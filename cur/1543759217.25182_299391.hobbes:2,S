I don't see a contradiction. You need testers for release candidates to
make them stable. The problem is that Linux release candidates are not
release candidates.

I don't see that the releases are stable. They are defined stable by
proclamation.

This 2.6.x.y tree will change nothing as long as the underlying problem
is not solved.

A clearly defined switch from -preX to -rc will give the avarage user a
clear sign where he might jump in and test. 
2.6.11-rc5 (which is -pre5 in disguise) would have been the real point
for a -rc1 ...-rcX freeze and testing phase.
