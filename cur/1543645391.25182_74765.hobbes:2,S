Receive Checksum Error on the APIC bus.
This indicates a hardware problem. Dual-Athlon boards
have a reputation for being unstable unless everything
is exactly right: power supply, cooling, not overclocked,
MP not XP CPUs, correct type memory modules. BIOS MP 1.1
or 1.4 settings may also be critical.
Also double-check all connectors between the mainboard and
the case: at least one board (the ASUS a7m266-d I think)
has or had bugs in its manual.
