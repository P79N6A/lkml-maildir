Should be harmless for now but we would like to fix it the long-term,
please send "hdparm --Istdout /dev/hda" output.

No IDE changes yet after 2.6.22-git17 so something else must have broke down.
Please retry with the latest -git kernel and if the problem is still
there install git, get kernel tree and run git-bisect.
Since 2.6.22-git17 works fine the initial "good" commit would be
e51f802babc5e368c60fbfd08c6c11269c9253b0 and the initial "bad" one
f695baf2df9e0413d3521661070103711545207a (for 2.6.23-rc1).
If you need some practical examples on using git-bisect, this one

is a very good one (IMO).

This message would indicate broken IRQ routing, however it is no
longer present in the log for the kernel 2.6.23-rc1-git4 ([3]).
Interesting that the kernel 2.6.22-git17 (log [2]) doesn't use via82cxxx
IDE host driver while the kernel 2.6.23-rc1-git4 (log [3]) does...?

With the buggy commit number obtained from git-bisect it should be
fixed quite quickly.
