glibc-2.2.2-10
dd if=/dev/zero of=./tgb count=4000 bs=1M
created file of 2147483647 bytes
[root@bits /a5]# dd if=/dev/zero of=./tgb count=4000 bs=1M
File size limit exceeded (core dumped)
[root@bits /a5]#
is glibc part of gcc? where do i find glibc?
(I've recently compiled gcc-3.00, but won't install cause it breaks kernel 
compilations).
TIA
Fred
