What I'm afraid is that udelay will be significantly slower, which
might hit anything that does a lot of gettimeofday calls (poking at the
PIT timer)  on embedded 386/486 systems.  On the other hand, those
systems might not want to upgrade to 2.6 anyway.  
And why do people keep buying HP hardware?  HP seem to be quite
Linux-unfriendly on the desktop [1] and on their laptops.  Apparently
HP doesn't even bother to try Linux on any of their non-server systems.
[1] Try running Linux on a HP DC7700 machine, there seems to be a lot
of magic stuff in those machines that doesn't work well with Linux.
They had some ACPI crap that stopped FC7 from booting without a lot of
magic PCI access options and audio still does not work.
