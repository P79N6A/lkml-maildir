"Ay. World is finished. Everyone can go home and watch Friends reruns now."
But well, there actually have been worse arguments given that VGA console is 
getting less and less important. I recently did a perusal of alternative 
distributions and didn't find a single one that didn't default to having a 
splash screen hide the kernel during boot (and if I'm not mistaken, only one 
of them provided me with the option during installation to not boot into X 
immediately afterwards).
Sure, that in itself needn't necesarily be of concern to anyone who, err, is 
not concerned but any such colouring feature appearing when there's only a 
smathering of people left that still cares about the VGA console in the 
first place really isn't all _that_ far out as an argument...
Rene.
