On the second thought, I think perhaps we should do the following.
if sys_rt_sigqueueinfo() sends the signal to the sub-namespace, then clear
always ->sid_pid. Otherwise do not touch it.
This way we can't break the existing apps, and this simplifies send_signal()
which should take "is_it_from_ancestor_ns" into account.
What do you think?
Oleg.
