I think what you are saying is that you'd like a way to use your HIPM
and DIPM without ALPM on the AHCI driver.  Fine - it's really easy
to add these levels later - if they don't make sense at the sysfs interface
we can add module params to specify the definition of "min_power" as 
being performed via HIPM and DIPM instead of ALPM - although as of yet we
have no evidence what so ever that this method actually adds value over
ALPM.

OK - this is why I added the blacklist for this feature.

"might increase"?  How about some actual examples of where you've shown
this to be a problem?  I can assert that I think ALPM is a good idea,
because I've never had a report of it causing problems.  Windows has 
been using this feature for a very long time - and you have to admit that
they have a pretty large market share.  Nobody is complaining about ALPM
increasing device malfunction, so unless you have proof it seems insane
to nak due to this.
