No. You've just shown that you like to argue. I recall that you
recently, like within the past 24 hours, supplied a patch that
got rid of the time-consuming stack operations in your semaphore
code. Remember, you changed it to pass parameters in registers.
Why would you bother if stack operations are free? The fact is
that you know that even a single extra memory access (i.e., a
stack operation) is costly. You just don't want to admit that
(remember the original premise if this discussion) popping
into an unused register to level the stack, is NOT better than
adding to the stack-pointer or, as another learned engineer
advised, using LEA instead.
I simply wrote some code that showed that poping registers used
more CPU cycles than adding to the stack-pointer, and using
LEA instead of the ADD showed no difference. Of course I
was immediately overwhelmed by responses that the benchmark
was invalid, presumably because it wasn't written by somebody
else.

It's not a total focus. It's just necessary emphasis. Any work
done by your computer, ultimately comes from and goes to memory.
Some is memory-mapped hardware "memory" some is simply RAM.
Managing those memory accesses is very important when it comes
to maximizing the work that your computer can do in a limited
period of time. Wasting memory-access time is something one
should not do if at all possible.

No, the world is crooked, not flat.
