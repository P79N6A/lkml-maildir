No. if cancel_delayed_work() fails, the work may sit pending in cwq->worklist,
or it may be running right now, waiting for rtnl_mutex.

Yes, but this deadlocks: we hold rtnl_mutex, and work->func() takes it too.
I think the fix should be so that port_carrier_check() does get/put on
"struct net_bridge_port" (container), but not on "struct net_device", and
del_nbp(struct net_bridge_port *p)
	if (cancel_delayed_work(&p->carrier_check))
-		dev_put(p->dev);
+		kobject_put(&p->kobj);
