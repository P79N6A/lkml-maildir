Yes, this is exactly the feature I'm looking for.  It would allow the
downstream users of a rebased tree to rebase themselves correctly.
All the information about the rebase is in the reflog ... it can't be
too difficult to pass it through on a pull and allow the downstream tree
to do the right thing.
