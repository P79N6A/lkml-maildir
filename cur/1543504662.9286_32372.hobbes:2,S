  The original meaning of the sticky bit was ``keep the program around in

or to be pedantic: 'keep the programme in backing store'. Where
backing store would be something like a page cache.
  The question is if any current systems still implement
  the sticky bit semantics ...
probably the more traditional 'backing store' type swap Unices still
do. Not sure which though. And i think the 'sticky bit for files' on
solaris has the opposite effect, ie it prevents the file from being
cached in any way.
