What on earth do you need a random number generator for?

Please use the same mechanism as I did last week for __iowrite_copy32,
instead of this ifdeffery.  If you search the archives, you'll find it.

Please define a pfm_flags_t or similar type, and mark it __bitwise for
sparse.

Why not an s32?

This overloading is a bit gross, if I understand it correctly.  You're
passing in a bitmask and getting back an integer, is that right?  Or is
it a different kind of bitmask in either direction?

If this header file is shared with userspace (it looks like it is) and
these are syscall arguments, these should all be double-underscored
fixed-size types, as should all other types and structs that may be used
by userspace.  Using unsigned long, in particular, makes extra work for
multiarch machines that will have to repack those structs.

/proc????

Please don't declare functions as extern.  It's redundant, and the head
penguins don't like the style.
Also, some comment in the header that makes it obvious where's the
boundary between functions that are purely internal to perfmon,
functions that can be used by other kernel subsystems (if any), and
syscalls would be useful.

Please move this to asm-ia64/perfmon.h, then.

How big are these sampling buffers, and would they be a better match for
relayfs?
