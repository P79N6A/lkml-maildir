I'm glad you asked.
The SX4 is a very different story.  The hardware XOR engine and on-board 
cache are not currently used, but they will be in the future.
For the TX series, there is no on-board cache, so hardware XOR engine 
isn't very useful.  For the SX series, it is very useful.
Promise did some neat stuff with the SX4...  so neat it takes some 
thinking to figure out how to best implement it in Linux :)
