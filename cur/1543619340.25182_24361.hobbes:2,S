This is most probably a console driver question, which is
kernel-specific ;)
I wonder what should console driver say when it doesn't have a real physical
console behind it. IMO, this should be a ENODEV case, or some other way
to determine programmatically that this situation takes place.
So, I am trying to find someone familar with console driver on
linux-kernel (since this driver doesn't have a specific maintainer).
If I am wrong, and linux-kernel is not relevant, sorry..
