The 3R BIOS includes the following changes :
1. Update BIOS code.
2. Enhance ISA PnP compatibility.
3. Enhance SCSI adapters compatibility.
4. Add 1400(133) Athlon support for KT7A/KT7A-RAID.
5. Add new option "1200 above" for high speed Athlons
   with 100FSB. KT7 / KT7-RAID / KT7A / KT7A-RAID / KT7E only support
   1.4G(100) Athlon with L1 bridges disconnected. Check L1 before
   you buy a CPU please!
6. For Creative SBLive 5.1 sound card users, you may try these
   options while experience sound quality issue.
   * PCI master read caching, default setting=Disabled
   * PCI master time-out, Default setting=1
   Setting above options to Disabled/3 will lead to the same result
   with VIA Latency patch V0.14 and may help SB Live 5.1 sound
   issue. If the system experiences low performance after these
   settings, enable the "PCI master read caching" please.
7. Enhance the high speed 133FSB Athlon stability for KT7A/KT7A-RAID.
8. HPT 370 RAID BIOS version 1.11.0402 for KT7-RAID/KT7A-RAID.
   This BIOS version is also for non RAID boards and HPT BIOS will
   be automatically disabled while RAID controller chip not detected.
I must admit that these specifications weren`t exactly the most technical I have
ever seen, but anyway ... taken from :
