Well now.  We agree about that, do we not?  I go on to conclude that it
is better to leave the job of monitoring module activity and determining
quiescence up to the module itself, do we agree about that as well?

Exactly my feeling.

Perhaps, but if so, the module itself should call the exit function in 
its failure path itself.  Doing the full exit whether it needs to be
done or not is wasteful and opens up new DoS opportunities.
In the example you give below you must rely on register_filesystem
tolerating unregistering a nonexistent filesystem.  That's sloppy at
best, and you will have to ensure *every* helper used by ->exit is
similarly sloppy.
