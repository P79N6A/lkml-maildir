No, many security installations use NFS internally. There are
several implementaions of capabilities across NFS (none
of which work together, alas) commercially avalable today.
The NSA evaluated version of Trusted Irix included NFS
for use in a controlled environment.
Those of us who take security seriously are freqently bitten
by those who say that no one who takes security seriously
would us something. If I took security seriously, I wouldn't
use a telephone, right?
