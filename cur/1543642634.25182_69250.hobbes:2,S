The alternative is a kmap-style mechanism for temporarily mapping
pages beyond physical memory on demand.  That would avoid the space
limits we have on vmalloc etc; there's only a few tens of MB of
address space we can use for mmap tricks in kernel space, so
persistent maps are seriously constrained if you've got a lot of flash
you want to map.
And with a kmap interface, your locking problems are much simpler ---
you can trap accesses at source and you don't have to go hunting ptes
to invalidate.
Cheers,
 Stephen
