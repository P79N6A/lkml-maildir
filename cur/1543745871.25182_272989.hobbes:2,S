Andrew, Linus!
Please consider applying the following patches, which add Filesystem
in Userspace.  The patches are against 2.6.10-rc2.  All comments since
the last submission have been incorporated:
  o don't use /proc, use /sys instead
  o add more documentation on locking
  o stylistic fixes
The patch is split up to the following parts:
  01 - add /sys/fs directory
  02 - MAINTAINERS, Kconfig and Makefile changes
  03 - FUSE core
  04 - read-only operations (getattr, readlink, readdir, ...)
  05 - read-write operataions (setattr, mkdir, symlink, ...)
  06 - file operations (open, read, write, ...)
  07 - mount options controlling the behavior of the filesystem
  08 - extended attribute operations (getxattr, setxattr, ...)
  09 - clustered read operation using readpages()
  10 - nfs export support
  11 - file data invalidate operation
  12 - direct I/O mount option
  13 - shared writable mapping
01-06 are crucial
07-10 are nice to have
11-13 are only to be applied if Linus changes his mind :)
I've included the last three so that those can be reviewed also.
Comments are welcome!
Thanks,
Miklos
