This one was fixed in kernel 2.4.19-pre8.

Can you try and install 2.4.19-pre10 with the included emu10k1?
I suspect you are just hitting a driver miscompilation problem when
compiling the module outside the kernel tree (somehow not using the 
correct compile options...) since the crash is inside 
interrupt_sleep_on().
