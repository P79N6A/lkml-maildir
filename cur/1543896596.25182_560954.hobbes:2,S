You've found yes (in the ARM case).

They may or may not be: I think that's a matter to discuss with rmk.
You keep on forcing the outside world to revolve around your needs
within slub.c: that is a good way to keep slub lean, and may be
justified; but it's at least questionable to be enforcing such
restrictions years after people have grown accustomed to more
freedom from their slabs.
