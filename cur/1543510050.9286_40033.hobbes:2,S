yes, the kind of workload you are generating hits the hardware really
hard.
_such_ types of lockups (if they are software) can only be debugged with
IKD's print-EIP component. See the IKD patch how to use that, it has a
learning curve, but since you can reproduce this easily it could debug the
lockup.
