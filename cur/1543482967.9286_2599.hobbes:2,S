Yes, but the problem is that when there _is_ stale data (unlikely), you
can actually do the wrong thing before.
Incrementing the page counter should fix all problems, but it's such a
subtle fix (even though it's essentially just a few one-liners) that I'm
not going to do it for 2.2.1, which I want to get out later today. 
Alan, the only patch I don't have that looks likely for 2.2.1 is the
IDE-SCSI thing. Did you have that somewhere?
Right now my 2.2.1 patches are:
 - the stupid off-by-one bug found by Ingo
 - __down_interruptible on alpha
 - move "esstype" to outside a #ifdef MODULE
 - NFSD rename/rmdir fixes
 - revert to old array.c
 - change comment about __PAGE_OFFSET
 - missing "vma = NULL" case for avl find_vma()
Holler now or forever hold your peace, because I'd like to get the thing
out in a few hours.
