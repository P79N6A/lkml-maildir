swap partitions are limited to 2G (or at least they were a couple of months ago 
when I last checked). I also don't want to run the risk of having a box try to 
_use_ 16G worth of swap. I'd rather have the box hit OOM first.

why?
it's been stated that doing a std and booting another OS (including windows) is 
a valid and common useage. saying that if you boot another OS you trash your 
suspended image doesn't sound reasonable.
