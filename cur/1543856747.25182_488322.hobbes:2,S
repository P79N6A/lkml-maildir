Last time I looked at them, things seemed to be in pretty good shape - it
wasn't a very large patch series.
The thing is (I'm going from memory here), gfs2 and ocfs2 are likely to just
make use of the option parsing (and setting of the MNT_RELATIME flag), and
ignore the changes to touch_atime() since we we handle our own atime
updates.
Overall I think it's a matter of pushing the patches to the kernel and to
mount(8). For ocfs2/gfs2 we implement a small amount of the logic in our
"lock and update atime" functions.
