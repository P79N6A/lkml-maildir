Hi,
I've noticed the very log value on bogomips on self-compiled 2.6.16.16
on iBook G4.
[06:12:59]ibookg4:~> cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
cpu             : 7447A, altivec supported
clock           : 1066.666000MHz
revision        : 0.1 (pvr 8003 0101)
bogomips        : 73.47
timebase        : 18432000
machine         : PowerBook6,5
motherboard     : PowerBook6,5 MacRISC3 Power Macintosh
detected as     : 287 (iBook G4)
pmac flags      : 0000001b
L2 cache        : 512K unified
pmac-generation : NewWorld
It was somewhat higher on 2.6.14.
Apparently I'm not the only person who noticed something similar; 
but I can't really read spanish:

Am I missing something or is everyone seeing this?
