Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is an interesting patch:
 if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
-   tristate 'SGI Newport Graphics support (EXPERIMENTAL)' 
CONFIG_SGI_NEWPORT_GFX
+   tristate 'SGI Newport Graphics support' CONFIG_SGI_NEWPORT_GFX
 fi
Now if anyone could explain the level of brain that went into that
one... :^) I'd say either to revert the patch or to dump the surrounding
if/fi pair. But that's just me, of course.
