ENOSYS isn't defined by SUSv3 (and thus not POSIX) for write(2).
EACCESS is defined only for socket errors, but you could of course
hijack it.  I think it is silly, though, since the open(2) succeeded.
Ideally, the open for writing should fail with EACCESS.
EIO actually means that an internal or physical I/O error occurred, PLUS
it is reserved for implementation-defined errors.  So that makes sense.
The main thing is to _not_ return zero.  That would cause stdio to
resubmit indefinitely.
