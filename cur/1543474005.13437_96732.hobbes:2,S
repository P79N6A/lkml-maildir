I'm getting a bit disturbed by an inconsistency between the
kernel.org mirrors.  For example, I have just connected to
katelyn.optilinkcomm.net, which apparently carries only bz2 files
and not gz files.
It seems to defeat the purpose if kernel.org mirrors don't
actually carry the full contents of kernel.org, even accounting
for any lag in pulling down new files.
