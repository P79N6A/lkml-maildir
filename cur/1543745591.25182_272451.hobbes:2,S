I did that long ago; the below patch is dated Oct 28 on my fileserver.
Alan could save himself some work if we shared patches... I already
backported even more of the networking stuff to 2.6.9 than he did.
# ioapic_on_nvidia_boards.patch
#
#       Originally suggested by Zwane Mwaikumbo
#
#       Ignore all ACPI timer overrides on all Nvidia boards.  The fallback doesn't
#       work and no Nvidia boards needs a timer override.  But some buggy BIOS have
#       it anyways.
#
#       Thanks to Andy Currid for confirming this.
#
#       Original patch enabled the IO-APIC.
