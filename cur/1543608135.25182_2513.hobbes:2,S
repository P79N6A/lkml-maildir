The offset needs to be sufficient to handle the case of the RTC being
set to local time and the boot and first ntp sync occurring on opposite
sides of a Daylight Savings Time change. A couple of timezones use a DST
offset of 90 minutes, so if it's less than that, there will be problems.

I knew about the "not less than 1 second" restriction, but not the "only
once a day" restriction. Can you confirm that the latter restriction is
indeed the case please?
Best wishes from Riley.
