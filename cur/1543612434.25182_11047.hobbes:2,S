There seems to be some confusion though.. I probably should just read the
code myself.. but it seems from what I've read that the patch we had
didn't clear all the bits and that maybe on the KT266, the chipset isn't
being detected as 'buggy' by the patch so nothing is being cleared... is
this correct?  If not would you mind taking the time to just tell me where
in the code I can grep for the patch?
