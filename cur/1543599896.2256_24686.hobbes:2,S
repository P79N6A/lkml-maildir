OK, sounds like enhancing LILO to load modules beyond the kernel is
unworkable.
Just for discussion's sake, I would like to point out that other OSs do have
loaders that can load boot drivers, and they can use this to increase the
modularity of their kernel. FreeBSD's and Win2k's bootloaders are examples.
Win2K even abstracts all SMP/UP code into a module (the HAL) and loads this
at boot, thus using the same kernel for both.
So of course I realize this wouldn't happen any time soon, but has any
discussion taken place regarding enhancing the bootloader (grub? Steal
FreeBSD's?) to load modular drivers very early, and possibly abstracting
SMP/UP from the kernel proper? Wouldn't this be a better solution than
initrd?
Just curious -- Andy
