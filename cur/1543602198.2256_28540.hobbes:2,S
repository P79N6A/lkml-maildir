  I don't consider "doesn't fix the problem" a negative report in this
case. If the system worked without the patch and failed with, that would
be very negative.

  I've been cursing getting an Athlon, because some applications I got
as rpms didn't work. With the patch they do, and I have to assume that
the code notes an Athlon and tries to use whatever caused the kernel to
oops. Fortunately these are development software I'm evaluating for
someone, and I let them know what was happening before they offered it
to the public.
