I tried it. -test3-mm1 works perfectly fine with Rhythmbox. X was a bit slow to 
update sometimes under heavy load, but I guess that's known.
Stock -test3 showed the same bda behaviour as -test2 though.
The only thing I don't want is users telling me my apps suck. So I thought 
alerting would be better than waiting for distributions to ship those kernels.
Thanks
