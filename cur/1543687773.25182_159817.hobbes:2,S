I'm not sure if you changed your mind or someone finally made a proposal
you like on the ARP issue, but is there an implementation your would find
acceptable (other than source routing) to send packets out from the NIC
with the SIP configured when there are multiple NICs and IPs in the same
subnet? Using a random NIC for a given SIP confuses Cisco routers (and
other things).
Source routing becomes very complicated when there are a lot of IPs and
they are changing, and there are several patches which force binding a SIP
to a NIC, but you don't seem to like any of them. Please suggest a better
way.
