Also, what kind of consistency is expected when a directory is open(2)ed
and readdir(2) and lseek(2) are applied to it when the directory gets
changed underneath the reader. From this:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/lseek.html
the behaviour/guarantees wasn't apparent to me.

And I defined this linear behaviour on the cache of dirents we maintain
in the approach I posted. And the main reason we maintain cache of
dirents in memory is for duplicate elimination.

You mean cache the offsets or dirents ? How would that solve
the seek problem ? How would it enable you to define a seek behaviour
for the entire union of directories ?
