Well, until i provided my hacky and probably buggy patch to aoss to use
libc's fopen()-et. al.-hooks, no app using the OSS api by way of libc's
fopen() et. al. was able to use aoss.  I don't use aoss anymore, as i
have hw mixing, so i haven't really done anymore testing. I admit of not
being sure, whether this principle error has any realistic impact (i.e.
apps/libs exist that resolve their system call symbols at build time - i
must also admit that i don't have really complete understanding of this
issue. maybe a more knowledgable person can speak up about possible use
scenarios besides libc).

Plus, i was wrong :) FUSE is for filesystems. fusd would be the choice
for this (not included in kernel yet). One might see how far one gets
with reusing code from both aoss and oss2jack
http://fort.xdas.com/~kor/oss2jack/
Btw: It has a nice list of compatible apps including skype and quake3
;)
Btw2: Heh, oss2jack already has direct ALSA support on its TODO list :)
