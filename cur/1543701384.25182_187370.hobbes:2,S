2.5.39 was the biggest regression for qsbench (fixed later, most notably
in 2.5.41). 2.5.39 was a significant improvement for efax ("fixed"
in 2.5.43).
All I'm doing here is reading the graph I posted at:
http://hellgate.ch/bench/thrash.tar.gz
For the systematic testing, I used "qsbench -p 4 -m 96" on a 256 MB
machine. This allowed the kernel to achieve high performance with
unfairness -- that's what 2.4 does: One process dominates all others
and finishes very early, taking away most of the memory pressure.
The spike for qsbench in 2.5.39 remains if only one process is forked
(-p1 -m 384), though.
I asked for the bk export numbers with 2.5.39 because I'm curious how
close to qsbench the behavior really is.

I planned to compare the io schedulers in 2.6.0 anyway. Do you expect
different numbers for a recent bk snapshot?
