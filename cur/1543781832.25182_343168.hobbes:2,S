no they don't. basically it just says your bios hasn't configured enough 
IOMMU space, so the kernel is going to do it anyway. it's really just a 
warning or an fyi rather than an error. i may have chosen the word 
poorly ;-)
in short Sean, this isn't a big deal. you only really need to change 
this if you want to remove a warning from your dmesg output.
