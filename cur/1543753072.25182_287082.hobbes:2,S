Is there a benchmark or set of benchmarks that would allow me to test the 
suitability of the CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE kernel config option?
It seems to me that the benefit of this option is very dependant on the 
amount of CPU cache installed, with the compiler code generation being a 
secondary factor.  The use, or not, of CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE is 
basically an act of faith without knowing how it impacts my particular 
environment.
I've got a Pentium4 CPU with 512KB of L2 cache, and I'm using GCC v3.3.3.  
How can I determine whether or not CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE should be 
used for my system?
Thanks.
