Normally, the "idle task" (task[0]) does this pseudo-code:
   while(1) { 
      if(need_resched)
         schedule();
   }
to minimize latency out of idle so if that actually is running it should
not be a problem (unless need_resched is not set by the wakeup calls)
Perhaps the kapm-idled kernel thread is killing your latency, you could
try disabling APM and APM-making-idle-calls especially. Also check ps aux
and see if anything else is taking your idle CPU %.
