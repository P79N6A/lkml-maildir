For kernel in 3 that do kexec, the devices and CPU state are saved into
memory before executing the new kernel. So when jumping back, the
control will continue from kexec point. If the memory image of main
kernel is restored from disk, the devices and CPU state in memory is
restored too. Before jumping back in 5, the devices are put in the known
state, after jumping back, the devices and CPU state is restored. If the
"kexec -j" is used to trigger the kexec in 3, the system will continue
with "kexec -j" exiting with exit code 0.

I think the early initialization can be done in a initramfs. At that
point, the resume image can be checked, the next step depends on the
result of checking.

It is possible for hibernate kernel to pass information back to
pre-hibernate kernel. For example, the information can be passed in jump
buffer page.
