I've continued my review of the menu-options in the v2.3.17pre1 kernel.
There are a LOT of places where either CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is required to
show a driver, but the option itself doesn't say that the driver is
experimental, and another lot of places where there's EXPERIMENTAL (or
Experimental) in the description, and no CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL...
I suggest that this should be reviewed. For instance, the parallel-port
support for Sparc-hardware is described to be (EXPERIMENTAL), but it
doesn't have this as a requirement. I believe (not sure; ask the Sparc
people) that this is probably quite stable by now, thus we should remove
the EXPERIMENTAL label.
I also think that we should be consistant and replace all occurences of
(Experimental) or (experimental) with (EXPERIMENTAL); this attracts the
user's eye in a better way.
I also suggest that we add a new config-option in the code-maturity menu;
CONFIG_DANGEROUS, which is required to show the options flagged
(DANGEROUS).
We should also do this for (OBSOLETE).
I can undertake to patch this for both v2.2.x and v2.3.x if noone else
steps forward, and if everyone's ok with this. I will then also try to
format the code in a consistent way.
BTW, why is there no config-option for Ultrix-partition support?
And is there any filesystem that can mount Ultrix-partitions?
