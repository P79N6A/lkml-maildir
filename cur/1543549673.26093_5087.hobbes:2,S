Unfortunately its frequently wired into the hardware to save a few cents on
scatter gather logic.
We need 128K blocks for sound DMA buffers and most sound cards they need to
be linear (but not the newer ones thankfully). Some video capture hardware
needs 4Mb but that needs to use bootmem (in 2.2 they use bigmem hacks)
