Oleg,
	Because of this change, was curious to know if this is possible:
CPU0					CPU1
(Thread0)
flush_workqueue()
					queue_work(W1)	
  flush_cpu_workqueue(cpu1)
    insert_barrier(B1)
      wait_on_completion();
					run_workqueue()
					   W1.func();
					     flush_workqueue();
						B1.func(); <- wakes Thread0
The intention of barrier B1 was to wait untill W1 was -complete-. If
W1.func()->....->something() were to call flush_workqueue on the same
workqueue, then we would be returning from the barrier prematurely.
Looks possible in theory. Don't know if it is a practical issue.
