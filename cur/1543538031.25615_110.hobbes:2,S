Well, Me too.
I'm using XFree 3.3.6 but with a Voodoo 3, also SMP (2x200mmx) 96M ram
and no usb, keyboard and mouse ps2. I think the problem in my case is
realted to XFree trying to use DPMS to shut down the monitor, if I leave
X alone eventually xscreensaver kicks in and after some time X tries to
shut down the monitor, when I come I found the last xscreensaver hack
frozen and the same simptoms as said before, no keyboard, no pings.
Had to try without DPMS activated, because if I leave the box in the
console but with X runnig nothing happens, later I switch back to X and
continue working.
