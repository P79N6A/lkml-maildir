I would like to use the Highpoint ATA 133 card with a 160 gig IDE drive. I 
don't see it on the "supported" list at linux-ata.com but I'm hoping there is 
something more current I can do. 
Any suggestions on what to do, where to look, or (if no other solution exists) 
alternative cards to use for ATA 133 would be appreciated. 
I haven't tried the vendor provided driver yet since I don't trust it and also 
becuase it doesn't support SMP meaning I'd need to get a new board (or take a 
processor out?) to use it.
Thanks
Matt
