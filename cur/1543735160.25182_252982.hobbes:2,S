This function is not use for highmem, AFAICS. If page is marked
reserved we do not touch it. Do you suggest that we need to save it
for highmem case?
MCEs... I see you have patch to disable them during suspend... That's
clearly wrong thing to do, right?

No, this function really is ugly and needs to die.
