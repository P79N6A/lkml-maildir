I can believe this :-(

OK, then.  If it isn't possible to detect geometry, how does Windows
determine geometry (even if it's geometry is "wrong").  I need to test
this more, but Windows needs partitions to begin and end on cylinder
boundaries, although the rules are a lot stranger than this.  (long
story).
So all that matters to me is that the geometry on the software side,
no mattter what operating system, needs to be the same.
Does Windows determine the geometry from the partition table ONLY?  If
that's the case, then there's no problem - we can use any geometry we
like, by writing it to the partition table (because Windows assumes each
partition ends on the end of a cylinder, the end head and sector values
should be the size of cylinders and heads, respectively).  But I
suspect it uses BIOS calls to do I/O - at least on
some systems, which will screw everything up.  Can someone confirm this?
Feel free to blow some of my assumptions out of the water.  I "guessed"
this from experiment, but I don't have a wide range of
hardware/MS OS's/BIOSes to tell.
