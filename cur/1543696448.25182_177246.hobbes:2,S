Then I propose CONFIG_RTC be set to "n" in the arch/alpha files, and the
/dev/rtc driver be disabled on alpha.  There seems to be confusion on
this point in the config files.  CONFIG_RTC is for the /dev/rtc driver.
Since the timer can only be set to powers of 2, it should be possible to
simulate getting the interrupt by calling the rtc.c interrupt handler
every 2^n interrupts...that way the user could program the timer for any
interval less than 1024 Hz.
