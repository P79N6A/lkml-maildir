Having a max rec_len of 65532 is rather unfortunate, since the dir
blocks always need to filled with dir entries.  65536 - 65532 = 4, and
the minimum ext3_dir_entry size is 8 bytes.  I would instead make this
maybe 64 bytes less so that there is room for a filename in the "tail"
dir_entry.
Cheers, Andreas
