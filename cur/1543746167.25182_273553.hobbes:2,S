The API version definitely can be, good point.

They have to be able to open the device node.  We could add a check
that they have it open for writing but there's not really much point
in opening this device read-only.
    Greg> And shouldn't you lock your list of agent ids when adding or

Each file has an "agent_mutex" rwsem that protects this... the global
list of agents handled by the lower level API is protected by its own locking.
    Greg> Also, these "agents" seem to be a type of filter, right?  Is
    Greg> there no other way to implement this than an ioctl?
ioctl seems to be the least bad way to me.  This really feels like a
legitimate use of ioctl to me -- we use read/write to handle passing
data through our file descriptor, and ioctl for control of the
properties of the descriptor.
What would you suggest as an ioctl replacement?
Thanks,
 Roland
