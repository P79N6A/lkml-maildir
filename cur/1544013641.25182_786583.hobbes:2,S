As mentioned before, suspending a laptop (running from hdd), running a live CD,
and expecting everything to work fine when resuming from hdd?
I think most people get shocked when they discover that mounting something
read-only may actualy write to the media. This is a bit unexpected (hey, if I
mount `read-only', I expect that no writes will happen), as it behaved
differently before the introduction of journalling.
As for mounting the root file system read-only during early boot up, and
remounting it read-write later, I guess it's quite complicated to replay the
journal (in RAM) on read-only mount, and deferring the replay writeback until
remounting read-write?

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
