Bogus handling of 16 successive LAN collisions.  Fixed (hah) in
test9-pre3.  You may still _very_ occasionally see this message if your
LAN is massively loaded.  It's telling you that the NIC couldn't send a
packet for 400 milliseconds.
All you can do is increase the timeout with the `watchdog=1000' module
parm (units are millisecs).  Or get a full duplex LAN.

Probably unrelated.  But someone has been playing with that bit of code
lately, so it's presumably in the "known problem" category.
