This is quite strange, normally it should never fail and, in all the
time version 5 has been available the maximum number of read locks has
never been exceeded.
Is there anything unusual going on like a server down causing autofs to
issue a number of mounts that are all waiting to time out?

Mmm .. if this is a genuine autofs issue maybe I need to handle EAGAIN
returns but that would mean blocking which probably isn't good and I'd
rather not if we can avoid it.

Is there anything in the log, an autofs4 kernel trace perhaps?
