I'm not sure if there is a good solution here, but I'm uncomfortable
with using uid=0 as the default.  I'm not sure if there is a default
uid for nobody, but anything is probably better than 0.  Looks like
nfsnobody is 65534, we could use that - even if only as a marker for
the server to map it to nobody on the target system?  What do you
think?
Particularly with attach-per-user, we probably need to look at
interacting with idmapd or create our own variant real soon.
