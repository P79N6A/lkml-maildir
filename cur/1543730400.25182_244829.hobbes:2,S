OK - I now have some additional info regarding the slapinfo/oom-killer issue.
As I wrote earlier this server is a storage server providing NFS storage to a 
number of webservers - ondisk filesystem is xfs, kernel = 2.6.8.1. At 03:00 
some logrotate scripts runs throug a lot of files. It appears that this is 
what is using the slabs (see this graph, K = M, so max used slab is approx. 
700M) 
http://saaby.com/slabused.gif
 (values are from /proc/meminfo)
These are the values (from slabinfo, active_objs), which changed remarkably 
from 03:00 to 06:00:
03:00:        06:00:
xfs_chashlist  91297    xfs_chashlist     151994
xfs_inode     243791    xfs_inode         586780
linvfs_icache 243791    linvfs_icache     586807
dentry_cache  196033    dentry_cache      430609
The server crashed every night at approx. 03:00 to 04:00 - until last night 
where we changed:
vm.min_free_kbytes from default (approx. 900K) to vm.min_free_kbytes=32768 
(32M)
This seems to solve the problem - Does this make any sense to you? - Or just 
pure luck?
