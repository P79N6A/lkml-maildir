Well it is obvious that this is a requirement.
If Linux does device name mapping at high level but leaves the low level part
unstable, then the following coul happen:
Just think about a program that checks a file that is on a removable media.
This media is mounted via a vold service and someone removes the USB cable
and reinserts it a second later. The filesystem on the device will be mounted
on the same mount point but the device ID inside the system did change.
As a result, the file unique identification st_ino/st_dev is not retained 
and the program is confused.
