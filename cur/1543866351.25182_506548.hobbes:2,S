I'm not sure I agree with it though as it results in two devices for
each backlight user as almost all users have an existing struct device.
The current approach allows you to attach the class to an existing
device and also means you can attach multiple classes to a given device
which gives more flexibility.
So the above question stills stands, why would you want to do this
(apart from removing some code)?
