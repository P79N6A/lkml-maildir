Hi Christoph,
Sorry I missed your comment. Actually I just looked at the archive of the
original thread and I do not see any comments from you. Were they maybe sent
in private to Peter Z ? Can you please resend them ?
Also btw can you comment on the 2/2 patch of this series instead. 1/2 is just
a resend of the original Peter's patch. 2/2 is more complete and tested version.
Thanx
Max
