The idea is that the reading side dosen't know it's a
pipe -- thus this interface can be used to provide
file-like access to non-filesystem objects like HTTP
files or Postgres large objects. With kernel support,
the reading side can be unaware that it is reading
from a pipe -- it just seeks. So you can do wierd
things like wget 
http://stuff/stuff.pdf
 | xpdf
/dev/stdin -- even though xpdf doesn't support piped
input.
However, Chris Siebenmann pointed out that a file
descriptor can be passed to other processes with
fork() or domain sockets -- thus the writer side of
the pipe would have to support multiple readers with
distinct positions. Which is a lot hairer than the
interface I outlined earlier.
Cheers,
