This means we will disobey cpuset and memory policy constraints?

Why does it have to? This is not true.

The constraints come from the context of memory policies and cpusets. See
get_any_partial().

Interrupt context is something different. If we do not have a process 
context then no cpuset and memory policy constraints can apply since we
have no way of determining that. If you restrict your use of the reserve 
cpuset to only interrupt allocs then we may indeed be fine.

No it cannot. One the current cpuslab is exhaused (which can be anytime) 
it will enforce the contextual allocation constraints. See 
get_any_partial() in slub.c.
