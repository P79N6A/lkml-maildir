It turned out that my version of glibc, which was compiled with a
gcc-4.4.0 snapshot, was the cause of the problem.
However simply compiling glibc again with gcc-4.3.2 did not work,
because glibc uses "LC_ALL=C sort -u" in many Makefiles. So I had to find
an old binary version of glibc, install that version in a chroot
environment and finally compile glibc again with a sane compiler in that
chroot.
