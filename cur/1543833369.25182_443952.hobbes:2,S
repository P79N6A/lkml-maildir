Yes.
But please stop call them "semaphores". PI only makes sense for the kind 
of semaphores called "mutexes" (which can be just a basic semaphore).
2.6.18-rc1 and 2.6.17-rt7 (and earlier) have PI futexes.
You still need a patch to glibc. I downloaded it from
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/PI-futex-patches/
I have tested it and it works fine (except for a small problem with 
pthread_mutex_timedlock(), which shouldn't be a problem for 95% of the 
applications :-)
