Agreed. Note however that the semantics for seekdir/telldir as
specified by SUSv2 are much weaker than those in our current
getdents()+lseek().
From the Opengroup documentation for seekdir, it states that:
  On systems that conform to the Single UNIX Specification, Version 2,
  a subsequent call to readdir() may not be at the desired position if
  the value of loc was not obtained from an earlier call to telldir(),
  or if a call to rewinddir() occurred between the call to telldir()
  and the call to seekdir().
IOW assigning a unique offset to each and every entry in the directory
is overkill (unless the user is calling telldir() for all those
entries).
Cheers,
