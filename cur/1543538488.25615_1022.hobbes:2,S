It's still not 101% reliable and you cut very important part of message:
-- cut --
... Very occasionally reaches 7 millisecs. It has been
tested during kernel builds, netperf, lmbench, mmap001, mmap002,
x11perf, general ext2 and NFS hammering, general usage.
-- cut --
There were not stated how often 7ms was observed.

Hmm. Why not ?
> Get the point?
No. We CAN NOT talk about ANY latency without probability factor (if we can
it's RTOS). And then if 1 ms latency is reached for 0.001% of time it's still
1 ms latency reached 0.001% of time. What IS important (and what was NOT
stated in Andrew's letter, unfortunatelly) is simple question "how often
latency is worse then 4 ms ?".

Heh. If it was THAT simple :-) The more pre-emption points you adding the
more slim is chance to get approval from Linus...

In mainstream kernel ? Who knows. I'm not sure if this six kludges are
acceptable from Linus's viewpoint, let alone additional ones needed for
more reliable 4 ms latency.

So far I've not seen any "good way". There are proposed few long-term solutions
but without working code so we can not be sure if they will actually work.
And all short-term solutions are kludges of some sort :-/

May be. But again may be not.

Have you read patch ? It's short and it's clearly stated there:
sys_unlink, sys_sync, sys_read, sys_msync (2 points) and sys_write

There were some scientific anylysis. Just EVERY place in kernel where work
was long was fixed with addition of pre-emption points without deep thought
if it can be fixed in some other sane way. This patch is still basicelly the
same as I can see: few functions where kernel will work for long time was
spotted with kernel patch and pre-emption points was injected there. Can not
see deep difference :-(( Just this time kludge it less intrusive and thus
looks more acceptable but that's all.

More or less :-/

As it was said by Andrew. There were included explanation of "sources of
latency spotting process".

It this patch will be rejected it will be rejected by the same reason as
original one: it's a kludge. Smaller (MUCH smaller) kludge but still a kludge.

Yes, it is. It's in the same league. Just much smaller and much less intrusive.

Huh. I'm pretty sure this issues are well-known for you already. Linux kernel
in NON-PREEMPTIVE kernel. Thus if some operation is long in ANY part of kernel
you chance to get low-latency audio is void. Thus you can not investigate just
some "important parts" of kernel. You MUST track ALL kernel functions and make
sure kernel threads will can schedule() often enough. Basically kernel SHOULD
NOT do a lot of work in one batch and so shedule will be called when atomic
function will be ended. Sometimes it's inavoidable. If there are few such
places we can add pre-emption points to them. If there are A LOT OF such points
then the only way is to redesign kernel (make it preemptive or may be just
redesign parts of kernel where it was designed wrong in first place and thus
casing big delays). Have you ever written ANY program for Windows 3.x ? It's
basically the same problem. May be non-preeemptive linux kernel is bad thing
for current world and may be it can be even fixed. Just not this close to
2.4 release: it's HUGE change.
