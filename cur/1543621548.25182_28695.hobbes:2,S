I tested current 2.5.5-pre bk on a diskless Pentium 200 MMX with 192MB
of RAM loading with PXELINUX and with nfsroot enabled.
The result was a triplefault (i.e. reboot) before console_init(),
which clearly isn't our code failing.
It was literally early enough I'm inclined to suspect bootloader
protocol issues.
Cheers,
Bill
