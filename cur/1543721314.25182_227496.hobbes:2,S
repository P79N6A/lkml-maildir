installkernel is a hack to install a kernel for current machine mainly.
Not what I consider a good generic solution.

I do not see the point in this.
Better make life easier - but in a nice and structured way.
Take a look at arch/ppc/boot/simple to see that the bootloader step is not trivial..
The concept with a clean and lean kernel that cannot be used in real-life without
doing lot's of stuff is a dead end.
