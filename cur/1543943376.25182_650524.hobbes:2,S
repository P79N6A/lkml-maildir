My, I am full of post scripts today.  This one is a peace token for Alan.

I do realise that my later postings come across harshly for Alan, and
that they might seem to be attacking him.  Of course, he did set himself
up for that with his own snide and personal attacks on me.  However, I
took no offense and likewise intended none.  I have not intended
anything personally.  I'm sure he's a jolly reliable bloke, and I can
see he's a hard worker for, and advocate of, Linux, and that he's
enormously respected.  Nobody is right all the time and this, I believe,
is a case where he is wrong.  I hope nobody is upset that I pointed it
out.  I also hope that the ideas behind EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL might be
reconsidered.
