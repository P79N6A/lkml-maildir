There is a problem else where or with your BIOS.
If the BIOS tells linux that there is a disk, it will attempt to find one.
Thus there are plans to ROOT-WAD the BIOS INT13 calls.....
If this is not the case then there is gobal kernel bug in the IDE code and
since this does not happen on any of the boxes that I have, I wonder if
your BIOS is doing funny things.
The patch you offer kind of late in the init processs, IMHO.
By the time chipset code is called, the driver should have "identified"
the device or marked it not present.
"piix_config_drive_for_dma" is called from ide.c's
"ide_register_subdriver" back to the ide_dmaproc and any callouts to the
chipset code.
I will look into this, but I thing something is may be kookie in your
hardware, IMHO.
