If you go down this path, please add a standard performance monitoring
method to query the current capacity of an interface.  It is frustrating
to report "eth0 is handling 1 Megabyte/second, but we cannot tell if
that is 90% (10BaseT) or 9% (100BaseT) utilization".  We should report
capacity rather than speed because speed alone is not the controlling
factor, other things like half or full duplex affect the capacity.
