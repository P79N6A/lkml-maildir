Seems to me that some of this can be solved with a good generic
ACL interface in the VFS.  Various filesystems may then implement
more or less of the VFS interface depending on what they support.
Just as some filesystems implement links and some don't.
So setting an ACL on something will work if the operation is supported
there.  I.e. AFS will reject ACL on a file and NTFS will not.  A fs
with extremely ill-fitting semantics may not use all abilities
when used from linux.
