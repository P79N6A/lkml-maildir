   Fairly often, but not always, the setserial commands run by the Debian
   2.0 boot scripts hang when booting 2.2.0-pre2.  This means the whole boot
   hangs, leading to a reset, and the associated fsck on the next boot :-(
   It is caused by "setserial -b /dev/ttyS1 autoconfig", and when the device
   is closed.  What is happening is that rs_wait_until_close is being called
   with a maximum timeout (MAX_SCHEDULE) by tty_wait_until_sent.  The loop
   in rs_wait_until_sent never thinks that the UART has finished sending,
   and so repeatedly re-schedules.
This appears to be a UART bug.  The TEMT bit is supposed to be set
whenever the transmitter shift register is empty.  Apparently, it's not
doing it for your UART after it leaves the automatic loopback state
(which is used by the UART configuration code).  I can't duplicate it on
my system, but your debugging traces clearly point to that as the
problem.
I've enclosed a patch below which should fix the problem.  Could you
please test it and let me know how it works for you?  Thanks!!
