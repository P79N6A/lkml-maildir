Legally, I think this is probably unclear.  But, I have my own, personal
standard I use for this.
The question in my mind is one of "can it stand alone".  In the example
originally mentioned, the new module (let's call it the alpha module)
registers function calls with the old module (let's call it beta).
Now, the question in my mind is this:  Is alpha a replacement for beta? It
certainly sounds like it.  But it depends of what/how many functions are
being overridden.  Are there other functions from beta which are used by
alpha (either as above alpha or below it)?  What are these replacement
functions trying to do?  If you're using an allready existing abstraction
layer, then you're probably okay... but if you're really inventing a new
abstraction layer, then you're probably not okay.
I guess what I'm saying is this: It all comes down to intent for me.  Yeah,
that's a lousy standard to use, especially in a courtroom.  But that's what
I really care about in the end.
