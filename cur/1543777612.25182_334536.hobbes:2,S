Adrian,
	Your patch is at my personal TODO list.
	We had lots of patches for 2.6.13, with some sigificative enhancements.
	Unfortunatelly, your patch from 19 Apr 2005 was not applied, maybe
because you've sent during a period where V4L was Orphaned.
	We've decided to stop non-bug fixes just some days before your newer
attempt (July, 7) to focus on more tests at a stable branch. Until July,
18, V4L are applying only bug fixes. After that, we'll collect more
patches at V4L and, maybe at the end of the next week, we'll send the
patchsets, including yours (It will be #1 :-) ).
Cheers,
Mauro.
