Let's not turn this into a flamewar, please. This is just a name change, 
nothing more.
As far as I know, the desire on Rafael's part and mine is still to get at 
least some of the functionality merged. The only reason this isn't happening 
yet is that we're both busy with other aspects of the work. Rafael is 
focussing on infrastructure issues, I'm focussing on minimising the diff and 
finishing off cleaning up and adding comments to functions.

Nigel
