Hi!
First I must say I have not sent anythink like that to LKML yet,
but gonna do my best to give as much and as good information as
I can.
Background:
I am using Debian unstable/SID. Because of some problems it
sometimes shutsdown uncleanly - after logiing out from GNOME 
computer just freezes. It is unstable, normally I am using
NVidia binary driver and VMware binary kernel modules so I
wasn't surprised by this.
But I also use ReiserFS on LVM (only root is outside LVM),
so I _was_ surprised when filesystem related problems came up.
It was so bad I had to use fsck.reiserfs --rebuild-tree on
unmounted partitions in single user mode.
Problem:
Today I was doing dist-upgrade - it froze my computer.
I *disabled loading all binary modules*, restarted my machine
and run the process again. Below You can see what it caused:

/var/lib/dpkg/info/bison.postinst: line 10: 542 Segmentation fault
the 10th line of the script is just "fi"
Other stuff:
I am also getting strange errors like denying access to some files
while doing ls on a directory content - as root of course.
System data:
kernel 2.4.18-pre3 with latest LVM patch and latest kernel preemtion
patch (as of 15.I.2002)
Own thoughts:
I think that's all. Just wanna say I a bit dissapointed with reiserfs.
When installing it (took me 2 days to do the transition from lilo, ext2
to grub, LVM and ReiserFS ;-) I thought it is meant to be immune against
system crashes and power failures.
Now gotta go into single user mode now and --rebuild-tree again on
every each partition... Maybe anyone has a better idea ?
I will be glad to see any responses, please Cc: them to me if You
please ( mailto:greg@sente.pl ) - or give me an address of any _live_
LKML news gateway.
Best regards
