I'm poking at it.  Something in my cross compiling setup is driving this bit 
screwy:
  i686-nm arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-sysenter.so.dbg | 
sed -n -e 's/^00*/0/' -e 's/^\([0-9a-fA-F]*\) . \(VDSO[a-zA-Z0-9_]*\)$/ = 
0x;/p' | LC_ALL=C sort > arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-sysenter-syms.lds
        if LC_ALL=C sort -u arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-int80-syms.lds 
arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-sysenter-syms.lds > arch/x86/vdso/.tmp_vdso32-syms.lds

If binutils is involved, it's due to i686-nm...
I'm still trying to puzzle out the "if thing && thing &&:; then" syntax above.  
Never encountered that one before...  A colon?  I'll try to bang on it some 
more tomorrow, it's gone 4am on me...
