Why yet another attempt to write 802.11 stack? Sure, the one currently
in the kernel is unusable and everybody knows about it. But why not to
improve code opensourced by Devicescape some time ago instead of
inventing the wheel again and again? Yes, I know that code is not
perfect and needs a lot of work, but it is the best piece of code we
have available now. And it _does_ support WPA and such - in fact, it is
nearly complete.
Please take a look at
