Hi,
I have a Sil3112A SATA controller, which linux works OK
with. It supports RAID (up to 4 devices), but I'm using
BASE option -- only 1 hard drive.
My question is regarding a 15-20 second delay which
normally occurs every time I boot, unless I pass the
options ide3=0 - ide9=0 to fill up the device table. I
think I have to do this because if I do only ide3=0
(where the device would be), it uses ide4, and so on. I
have GRUB set up to do this automatically, but it's not
exactly adequate (,is it?). So I was wondering if
there're any other ways to get the same affect. Is or
could there be an option to simply disable the probing
of the one specific device/channel every time?
Thanks,
Brien
