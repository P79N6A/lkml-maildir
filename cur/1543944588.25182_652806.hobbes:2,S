Not at all, we're just not doing transition right now.

And you're overlooking something: tpl is not an enumeration blocker at
all. The only blockers are drivers and power limits.
Imagine what happens on n810, we have 3 mass storage devices listed on
its tpl: 770, n800 and itself. Besides that, we allow enumeration of any
mass storage device as long as it draws less than 100mA. These tips I
got from otg chairman himself and from OTG Clarification document, you
can find it in compliance.usb.org. So, what I'm trying to say is if
a_device let us become host, we shold at least try to do, let's call it,
full enumeration. Which means attaching any unlisted mass storage device
should work.

True, sorry. :-p

aka ending the session, yeah. But once again I'm still thinking we
should try to enumerate the device and, in mass storage case, start scsi
emulation, mount fs and so on.

But then a-device should end the session, not b. If we really can't use
that a_peripheral, we suspend and roles swtich again. In this case
a_host should know we're still that non-working b_peripheral and end the
session.

OTG 1.3 page 25:
OTG products are required to support HNP as an A-device. OTG products
must support HNP as a B-device if they can support any OTG product as
a peripheral. OTG products that cannot support any OTG product
as a peripheral are not required to support HNP as a B-device.

We can't support classes. What I'm trying to say is we have usb mass
storage support enabled in kernel and we can handle _any_ mass storage
devices as long as they meet otg requirements.

Not true, check again Chapter 6 Host Negotiation Protocol and OTG
Clarification regarding TPL.

Good catch. That'd be nice.
