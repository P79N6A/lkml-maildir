It seems to me that if device and target path are identical,
only the options need to be changed, not the whole mount,
and if no options are changed, the whole operation should be ignored.
In other cases, it would be better to stack the mounts, especially if
the device is different.
And even messier--can I rip out the bottom item in the stack?
I.e., 
mount /dev/fd0 /floppy
mount /dev/fd1 /floppy
umount /dev/fd0
Exactly how flexible are the semantics of this?
