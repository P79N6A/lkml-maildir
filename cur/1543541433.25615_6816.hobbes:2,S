Yep, that's fine - on machines where each card has a unique MAC address.
Some platforms have per-MACHINE MAC addresses instead, at which point your
idea falls flat on its face...
Rather than have one system for x86 and some platforms, and another for
Sun and others, it's better to stick with one system for all Linuxes,
IMHO. The allocation of interface numbers may be fairly arbitrary, but it
should be relatively constant across reboots, I think?
