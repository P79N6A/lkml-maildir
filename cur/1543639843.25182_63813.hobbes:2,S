It's still buggy, and you didn't read what I wrote.

+       if (clone_flags & CLONE_SETTLS)
+               if (put_user(p->pid, (pid_t *)childregs->edx))
+                       return -EFAULT;
Find the bug. Find the sentence I wrote that pointed it out last time. 
Notice how your testing did not find it, since you always just set both
