Hi Andre,
Since I was bold enough to criticize your writing not long ago, I want
to say now that I had absolutely no trouble understanding this post.  It
was a pleasure to read, and I thank you for taking the time and effort
to make it that way.  The improvement is dramatic, and it really helps.
Keep up the good work!
