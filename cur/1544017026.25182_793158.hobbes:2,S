I think flags is right. That way, a caller of pagecache_write_begin (eg. page_symlink)
can instruct it with AOP_FLAG_NOFS to prevent grab_cache_page from doing a GFP_KERNEL
allocation.

This should be 0. grab_cache_page_write_begin takes write_begin aop flags rather
than regular gfp flags (it's a bit confusing, sorry :P). 0 ~= GFP_KERNEL (wheras
AOP_FLAG_NOFS ~= GFP_NOFS). So you have the right idea ;)
