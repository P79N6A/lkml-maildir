Hi.
I'm going to stand firm on this one, Pavel.
I think being able to cancel a suspend is a really useful feature, and
I'll be surprised if we don't see Microsoft including it in their next
version of Windows (perhaps I should take a patent out! :>)
That's not to say that I haven't listened to you, however. That's why I
tightened up the requirements for using it yesterday. As to the extra
proc entry, it's not a biggie: 2.4 swsusp now has it's own proc handling
code which is easily extensible. I did this to make it easier to
understand.
This...
[nigel@laptop-linux nigel]$ ls -l /proc/swsusp/

[nigel@laptop-linux nigel]$ 
is easier to understand and configure. The /proc/sys/kernel/swsusp
interface is still there to make it easy to save & restore them all at
once.
