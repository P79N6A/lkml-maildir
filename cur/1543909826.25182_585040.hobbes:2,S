Alan:
Thanks for the comment. I will code a patch, and include a sanity check 
as you suggested, and send it for review. Just to clarify one concern 
your note raised:
I understand that SMM/SMI servicing can take a long time, but SMM/SMI 
shouldn't  happen while interrupts are masked using local_irq_disable() 
[included in spin_lock_irq()], at least on x86-architectures.  If 
SMM/SMI can happen even then, the NMI fix below could be generalized.
My mention of NMI (which by definition can't be masked) is because NMI 
can happen even while interrupts are masked.  This is a timing problem 
that can't be dealt with by masking interrupts, and NMI's are used for 
watchdogs, etc these days.   It seems like just a general good thing to 
be able to ask if an NMI has happened.   A per-cpu NMI eventcount that 
is incremented every NMI would allow one to detect NMI's that happen 
during an otherwise masked code sequence by reading it at the beginning 
and end of the code sequence.   Don't know if NMIs are common on other 
architectures, or if this is an architecture dependent concern.
Perhaps I'm really talking about two patches here.  One for a mechanism 
to detect NMIs that happen during a critical piece of code (so it can be 
retried), and one that depends on that to be really proper in reading 
the RTC reliably.
