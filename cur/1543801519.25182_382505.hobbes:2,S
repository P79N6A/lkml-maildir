In fact, one tab could be lowered, it's the first one. Nearly all code
has at least this tab which is not very useful and would not affect
readability if reduced to 2 or 4. But it will be difficult to maintain
a variable tab width, not to mention the alignment problem on the
second tab.
BTW, if 80 is not enough, simply consider that one tab is exactly one
character ( '\011' ) and you will be able to put more, but I doubt
your code will be accepted ;-)
