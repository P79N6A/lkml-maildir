Restore tty locked ioctl handler which was replaced with
an unlocked ioctl handler in hung_up_tty_fops by the patch:

    tty: add compat_ioctl
This was reported in:
[Bug 8473] New: Oops: 0010 [1] SMP
The bug is caused by switching to hung_up_tty_fops in do_tty_hangup.
An ioctl call can be waiting on BLK after testing for existence of
the locked ioctl handler in the normal tty fops, but before calling
the locked ioctl handler. If a hangup occurs at that point, the
locked ioctl fop is NULL and an oops occurs.
