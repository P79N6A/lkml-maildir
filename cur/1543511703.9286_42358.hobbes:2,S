Agreed.  While many hate Unicode, that might be true, almost all users
don't care what code they use.  And it should be so, I think.
While many hate x86 code for excellent reasons, you know, but I for my
self, don't mind the x86 code, provided Linux runs on it. :-)
User space or kernel space, wherever it is, it would be good to
support large character sets (whatever the code is, Unicode would be
OK) in console.
