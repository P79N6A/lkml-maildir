It means your BIOS vendor can't read specifications.
'AMD Athlon(tm) Processor'. is the power-on default.
On working out if the CPU is an XP or an MP (by reading the MP bit
in cpu capabilities flags) it's supposed to set the name string.
Crap BIOSen only do this for the first CPU.
It's harmless, but I'll get around to writing a boot time fixup
sometime.
