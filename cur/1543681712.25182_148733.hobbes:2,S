| The rarer bugs that do present on an average machine, with average loading

| Just running it helps, if only because it lowers the probability of such

The I/O schedulers and process(or) scheduler want to be beaten on
very badly.  For process scheduler, try playing music and writing
a CD while building kernels etc. and see how well you can move the
mouse around in X.
