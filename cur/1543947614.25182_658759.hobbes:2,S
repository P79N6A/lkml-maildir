Can't they?  Looks like one can create any number of vfsmounts without
getting more than one marked MNT_USER...
What are you trying to limit - vfsmounts or superblocks?  The former is
not limited in your patchset at all, AFAICS - you can
do while true; do
	mount --bind /bin ~/my_directory;
	mount --bind /sbin ~/my_directory;
done
indefinitely and all the bleeding stack of vfsmounts will be !MNT_USER.
Or any number of similar schemes, really, without overmounting if you
wish to avoid it.
If you are trying to limit the number of superblocks (i.e. active instances
of filesystems), then I'd say that vfsmounts make piss-poor proxies for
those and it would be better to count the objects you really want to count...
