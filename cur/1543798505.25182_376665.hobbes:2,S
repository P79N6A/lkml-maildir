unshare is doing the reverse of what clone does. So if you are unsharing 
namespace
you want to make sure that you are not sharing fs. That's why the 
CLONE_FS flag
is forced (meaning you are also going to unshare fs). Since namespace is 
shared
by default and fs is not, if clone is called with CLONE_NEWNS, the 
intent is to
create a new namespace, which means you cannot share fs. clone checks to
makes sure that CLONE_NEWNS and CLONE_FS are not specified together, while
unshare will force CLONE_FS if CLONE_NEWNS is spefcified. Basically you
can have a shared namespace and non shared fs, but not the other way 
around and
since clone and unshare are doing opposite things, sharing code between 
them that
checks constraints on the flags can get convoluted.
