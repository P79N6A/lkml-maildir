perhaps your logic could check if write allocate is enabled at all.  if
it's not already enabled, only then try to enable it.  that would allow
Linux to use the BIOS's default setting on hardware that automatically
enables write allocate.

yes, i've disabled everything marked "shadow", and turned off VGA and
System BIOS caching.  no change -- it still re-enables only 60M.  (i never
noticed that missing 8k before :)
