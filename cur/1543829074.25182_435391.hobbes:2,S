Very clever.

Can we use similar  mechanism to access pda in vsyscall in x86_64 (by
storing the address of pda there).  That way the useful variables like
cpunumber, nodenumber can be accessed easily without doing cpuid (and
without tcache).  The system call can take a flag like GET_CPUNUMBER or
GET_NODENUMBER or GET_NMICOUNT or if anything new gets added in this
structure.
