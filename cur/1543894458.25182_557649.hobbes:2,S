Bad analogy. I've already provided all the proof needed to prove that, 
while "tivoization" may be against the "intent" or "spirit" of the GPLv2 it 
is not in violation of it.

Okay. That means that if I ship Linux on a ROM chip I have to somehow make it 
so that the person purchasing the chip can modify the copy of Linux installed 
on the chip *if* I want to follow both the spirit and the letter of the 
GPLv2. And no claiming that I'm missing the point - I'm drawing a logical 
conclusion from your statement above.

I have no objection to this. What I object to is the manner in which it is 
being done. However, I must admit that, at this point, I do not know of a 
better method to achieve this goal.
