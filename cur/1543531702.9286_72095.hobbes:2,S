I have updated the timepeg point-to-point time measurement toolkit for
2.3.99-pre3.  The changes are:
- Some bugfixes.
- Someone crippled drivers/misc so I've been realistic and moved the
code to arch/i386/kernel and include/asm-i386.  I doubt if it would have
worked on the Alpha anyway...
- the 'tpt' tool has grown a '-s' option to produce output which can be
fed into sort(1).
- Added 'start' and 'stop' timepegs.  Normally a timepeg acts as both an
initiation and a termination point for interval measurement.  'start'
timepegs act as initiations only.  'stop' timepegs act as
terminations.   Read Documentation/intlat.txt to see me make another
balls-up of explaining this.
Patch is at 
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/
It's bundled with the intlat patch.  intlat is separately enabled
(CONFIG_INTLAT).  intlat reguires CONFIG_TIMEPEG.
