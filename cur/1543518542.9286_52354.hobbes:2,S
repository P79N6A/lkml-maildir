Hi All,
I would like to know whether there are any "Telephone Interface Cards"
available that support Linux. We are in the process of developing an 
interactive mail reader and an interactive voice respone system, for which
we require an Telephone Interface Card. Ideally, at the outset, we would
like to dial to a telephone(PSTN) from our Linux Server and play out an
message(wav file). In addition, the Telephone Interface Card, should also
be capable of detecting DTMF signals. This is required for making the
application interactive. 
From the information I could gather, all the Telephone Interface cards
available in the market support Windows(or Unix,Solaris), but not
Linux.
Has anyone used any "Telphone Interface card" successfully with Linux ?
Expecting a reply.
A.Ramasamy.
