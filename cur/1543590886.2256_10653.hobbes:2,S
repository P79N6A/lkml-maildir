	I was about to report the same 'od' behaviour : I have 3
	machines, connected via a HUB at 100 Mb/s half duplex.
	From machine A : rsh B dd if=/dev/zero bs=8192 | dd of=/dev/null
	=> transfert around 10/11 MB/s (B => A)
	Now, I start a second transfert from machine C :
	rsh B dd if=/dev/zero bs=8192 | dd of=/dev/null
	=> transfert around 10/11 MB/s between B and C, almost nothing
	between A and B (ie, the connexion is stalled between A and B).
	If I stop the second transfert, I takes many seconds for
	the transfert to restart between A and B.
	On a highly saturated network, I have already seen such a
	behavior.
	Is that related to the IP adresses, the lowest being served
	first ?
