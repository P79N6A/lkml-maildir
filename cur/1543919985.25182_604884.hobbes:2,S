Some things to check:
* Run "hdparm -I" on your drive. In the "Capabilities" section there is 
a line "Standby timer values", for some drives this mentions a device 
specific minimum. I know some drives that ignore any setting below 60 
seconds.
* I also know of quite a number of drives where hdparm -B settings 
override the -S settings, even if you set the -S settings after the 
hdparm -B settings. You could try combinations with various values of 
hdparm -B, especially 1 and 255.
Cheers,
Bart
