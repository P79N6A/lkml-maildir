Yes, but kernel mode support in user programs would allow user mode 
device drivers to do stuff that currently cannot be done at all from user 
space such as handling interrupts and scheduling DMA operations.
Just think about how nice it would be if the kernel level DRI driver 
modules that are currently completely separate from the user space X 
drivers could be all in one place? Then users would no longer have to 
worry about making sure they upgrade their kernel so it has the correct 
kernel module installed at the same time that they upgrade X or get new 
drivers for their X server.
IMHO I am not sure how much speedup you would gain from kernel mode Linux 
for user space programs (it might surprise us, or maybe it isn't much), 
but the ability to support user mode device drivers would be good IMHO, 
especially for graphics.
