 From what I've seen the problem seems to be that the inode
gets marked dirty when we update atime.
Why isn't this easily fixable by just adding an additional dirty
flag that says atime has changed? Then we only cause a write
when we remove the inode from the inode cache, if only atime
is updated.
Unlike relatime, there's no user-visible change (unless the
machine crashes without clean unmount, but not sure anyone
cares that much about that cornercase). Atime changes are
thus kept in-ram until umount / inode reclaim.
