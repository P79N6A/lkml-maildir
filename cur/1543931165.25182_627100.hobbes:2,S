Well, I respectively disagree.  sysfs is NOT for exporting various
binary kernel structures to userspace directly.  Again, the binary files
in sysfs are for chunks of memory that are PASS-THROUGH from hardware to
userspace, with no kernel intervention at all.
If you really need such a thing, use debugfs, as the only rule for
debugfs is that there is no rules :)
So I do not agree with this change at this time, and do not want to see
it applied to the tree.
If you really need this kind of information exported to userspace
through sysfs, then expand it all, in a one-text-value-per-file
format.  I would have no objection to that.
