Well, when I asked Alan about it, he said "Doing it in 2.2 is incredibly
hard for internal locking reasons"... I'm not ready to tackle that.
If you have a patch that does it correctly, submit it to Alan.
I'd still like to have the option I submitted as part of 2.2 *shrug*...
it's just bringing back functionality that was in earlier versions of
Linux as a compile option.  (From what I understand, this is similar to
something done in the BSDs at some time in the past... but being a young
whippersnapper, I don't really know.)
