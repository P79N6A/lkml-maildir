Not necessarily.  Memory isn't merely used to hold swappable stuff, it also
caches files.  Consider a small but io-intensive program.  The stuff
you want isn't necessarily the last swap (perhaps there
even isn't anything swapped out) , it might be the last thing
dropped from cache instead.
And we can often predict better than "the last thing swapped/flushed"
A bunch of free memory appearing could usually be better used for
extra read-ahead, wether it is read-ahead of files/directories/bitmaps
being accessed, or executable code faulted in from executables or
swap devices.

"What we're going to need soon" is the best.  It isn't always predictable,
but sometimes.  "The block following the last we read from some 
file/fs-structure"
is often a good one though.
