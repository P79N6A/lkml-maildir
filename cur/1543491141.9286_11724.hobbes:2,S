Does 2.0.36 report this different than the current 2.2.x?
processor	: 0
cpu		: 586
model		: AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor
vendor_id	: AuthenticAMD
stepping	: A

flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 syscr mmx 3dnow
I believe that my processor (a 266MHz part) is too old to have the ctx
core, but I don't know whether "A" is less than "8" or not.
