Subject: EXPORT_SYMTAB, or Is "this_object_must_be_defined_as_export_objs_in_the_Makefile" annoying to anyone?

I am not sure for the reasoning behind it, but it seems that newer 2.4
kernels require the additional -DEXPORT_SYMTAB be defined for any code one
wants to build as a module (if that module exports symbols).  Needless to
say this breaks a lot of (non-kernel-tree) modules that would otherwise
have been compiling without problems.
What is the rationale behind this?
