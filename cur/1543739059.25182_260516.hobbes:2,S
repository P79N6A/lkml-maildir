I have been having zombie problems since 2.6.9-rc1.  I run a boinc
climateprediction program (related to seti@home) which leaves defunct
"cp" processes about.  Killing the climatepredictor (called
hadsm3um_4.03_i686-pc-linux-gnu) which spawns them causes these zombie
cp things to get reaped.

I tried it with 2.6.9-rc3 just now and it doesn't make zombies for
me.
climateprediction still makes defunct cp.
(I fired up 2.6.9-rc4 but it somehow wouldn't load the driver for my
ethernet 3c59x.  That's another issue, but I have no idea if the
problem has been fixed there since I am stopped by another problem.)
I skimmed over the changelogs but I have found anything looking like a
change in this area.  I am not sure what the right keyword(s) to
search for on this topic would be.  I didn't grovel through them yet,
but perhaps someone on the list knows what is going on.
