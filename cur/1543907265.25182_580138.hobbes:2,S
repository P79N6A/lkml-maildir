OK, well I had to make a bit of on-the-fly adjustment to
pid-namespaces-rename-child_reaper-function.patch as well.

Hopefully people can re-review and retest what's there in next -mm.
Or if that's too much work or too risky, option b) is to drop
handle-the-multi-threaded-inits-exit-properly.patch, go back to the
2.6.23-rc1-mm2 versions of
pid-namespaces-define-and-use-task_active_pid_ns-wrapper.patch and
pid-namespaces-rename-child_reaper-function.patch and to ask Oleg to cook a 2.6.23-rc1-mm2 version of handle-the-multi-threaded-inits-exit-properly.patch.
The downside of this approach is that
handle-the-multi-threaded-inits-exit-properly.patch looks more 2.6.24-ready
than all the container stuff (based just on overall impact and
speculativeness)
