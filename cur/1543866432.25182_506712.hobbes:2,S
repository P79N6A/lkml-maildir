More on printf, `sh', tmpfiles.
As we know original problem is: something from binutils is removing
output files on failure.

here is policy to have `bash' introduced, so due to original
issue, where `root' users ended with removed /dev/null, may policy to have
`non root' user to build kernel be added? Thus

may be removed, and to make TMP=/dev/null? And to forget currently about
my silly symlinks, and this crappy sets of output files?
As for `printf', as i've wrote, only in case of % and quotes in
arguments, something else must be added to handle that. But i think, it's
paranoia.

`printf $(1)' is pretty enough.
