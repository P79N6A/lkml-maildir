I can confirm that you'll need to use the internal pxa27x pullups for
this. You'll probably also need to make sure GPIO 35 is low to ensure
the usb Vcc line isn't powered (as it would be in usb host mode.
Ultimately, it would be nice to have the Zaurus detect whether a usb
host or client was present (using gpio 41 maybe?) and then activate the
host (ohci) or client (pxa27x_udc) driver as appropriate.
Cheers,
Richard
