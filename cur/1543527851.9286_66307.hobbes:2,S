Artur, 
Thanks for the explanation. Actually, I was talking about the situation
after applying Andrea's patch, which essentially made
do_gettimeoffset=do_slow_gettimeoffset which does not use TSC. 
In general, I think it is a bad idea to rely on 2 (or more) hardware
counters being always the same. I think the right solution is just to
use one of them. (Of course I am biased ;-). I can imagine an SMP laptop
where one processor sleeps most of the time...
How hard is to force reading TSC of just say the boot processor in
do_gettimeoffset?
I am more than willing to do the leg work if somebody points me to the
right direction.
Boris
