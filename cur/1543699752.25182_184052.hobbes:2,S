Hi,
this is my first bug report, I hope I don't leave out any vital information.
The ALSA driver for i8x0 sound cards has a minor bug in all 2.6 test 
versions except test1. The sounds "lags" sporadically for a few seconds. 
It's not a total stop of playback, the speed is even increased a little bit. 
It just sounds weird... at first I thought it has something todo with the 
scheduler, but since nice -20 has no effect at all, I doubt it. The problem 
occurs with xmms and mpg123.
cat /proc/asound/cards:
0 [I82801CAICH3   ]: ICH - Intel 82801CA-ICH3
                     Intel 82801CA-ICH3 at 0x1400, irq 10
The machine is a toshiba 5200-701 notebook (european), 1.9 GHz Pentium4, 512 
MB RAM, average cpu usage is ~5% during playback (according to gkrellm). The 
driver is compiled into the kernel (=Y).
