Did you compile vfat support?  Did you compile it modular?  Did you
enable kmod?  If your first answer is no, that's your problem.  If your 
answers are yes, yes and no, you need to run "modprobe vfat" before
mounting the partition (put it in a boot script somewhere).  If your
answers are either yes+no+N/A or yes+yes+yes, I don't know what your
problem is.

Please don't do that.  That package, MSHTML 5.0 ... it sounds ominous.
