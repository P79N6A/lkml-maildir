I think you want %.*s

Things like this NULLing could be removed. It if then oopses somewhere,
you either
   (a) needed this =NULL indeed (because some other function depends
       on it being NULL)
or (b) found a bug elsewhere (more likely, since you write "just to be safe")
The (a) case is needed if you wanted to kfree(dtopd_lhs(dentry))
elsewhere it.
