Wow, I didn't know that there was an extended PDP-10 architecture.
It's 25 years since I did anything on a PDP-10. :)

Would you use 9-bit bytes or 8-bit bytes?  If you use 8-bit bytes then
there will be some bits in a word that aren't part of any byte.  If
you use 9-bit bytes, I'm sure that somewhere in the kernel there will
be some code that will break because it is assuming 8-bit bytes.

Somehow I'm getting the feeling that your next message is going to say
"actually, we have been running linux on the KL10 for the past 3
years". :)
