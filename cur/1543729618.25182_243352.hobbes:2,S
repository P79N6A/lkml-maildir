Maybe your problem is that you are not involved with the discussion?
From the last discussions, I can tell that Debian has no problems with what's 
going to become cdrtools-2.01-final.
I am one of the persons that publish the most Free Software per person.
I am "living" the OSS/FS rules but it seems that some companies still have to 
do their homework to understand what Free Software means. 
My intension is _not_ to make my software non-free but to tell people who 
believe that they may do with other people's software what they like that there 
are limits. If these people/companies would be cooperative, this problem was non
existent. As it sometimes is hard to find the right algorith to do the job
right, it is the the same for contracts. You may need several iterations to find
the best solution.

I explain why e.g. SuSE is non-cooperative. This is different from what you 
write.
