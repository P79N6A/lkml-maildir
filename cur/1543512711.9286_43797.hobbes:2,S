Hi all.

Correction to the above, following some suggestions I received: The
kernel versions pages (not the plural) can now be found at the
following URL, and as well as the consolidated list, there are
sublists by year released, and there will soon be sublists by kernel
series as well - that set is currently under development.
Also, several HTML errors in the original versions have been pointed
out to me, and all have now been corrected.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below.
