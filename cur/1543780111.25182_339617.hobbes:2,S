"This can happen" is not an acceptable explanation, I think. Modules should
not be able to kill the kernel -- apart from that, I can trigger the bug in
the very early "ash-system" that KNOPPIX provides. At that time, the modules
listed below were the only ones loaded -- no others, and I am also sure that
until that point, no modules were unloaded.
