   Instead, you should make a rule based upon performance (like
   network communication).
As stated in my other posting, in the realm of IP protocols at least,
there is no issue, there is no performance penalty, it's all in the
noise with todays cpu speeds and how we've cleverly minimized the byte
swapping as much as possible in our stack.
As for the display etc. device argument, this is nonsense too.  I talk
to little endian video cards, little endian ide controllers, etc. on
my big-endian mode cpu every day and it goes at hardware speeds.
