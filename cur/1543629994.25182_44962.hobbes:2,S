I tried a version of __daemonize in 2.4. It panics in
schedule()
        prepare_to_switch();
        {
                struct mm_struct *mm = next->mm;
                struct mm_struct *oldmm = prev->active_mm;
                if (!mm) {
                        if (next->active_mm) BUG();
I got hit by the BUG() in 2.4, I think prepare_to_switch has
moved to specific archs in 2.5. A quick look showed that
this issue no longer exists in 2.5.
Comments,
Balbir Singh.

|Subject: [PATCH] Hotplug CPU prep III: daemonize idle tasks
|
|
|This patch introduces __daemonize(task), so idle tasks can be detached
|after cloning (required for late creation of idle tasks).
|
|This is independent of the last two patches.
|
|Name: Daemonize idle task
|Author: Rusty Russell
|
|D: This patch allows daemonize() to be called on another process (if
|D: not started yet), and calls it on the idle task.
