Yeah, just read through it.  It really doesn't seem like it matters that 
much whether "keypress+notify" events are delivered via the input layer 
or via some sort of uevent.
However, since we already have userspace code in place handling the 
input layer case, why not just go with it?  It's fairly straightforward 
and already works in some distros.
