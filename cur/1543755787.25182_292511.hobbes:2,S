I see. The data structure is put on a part of loading kernel's data.

I don't make sense. what do you mean ?
What we want to do when the system is crashed is storing the whole
physical memory (and saved register information for x86 arch) to
some place (ex. a disk partition) for later analysis. 
So the basic requirments to the dump kernel is that:
 * supply a method to access whole (valid) physical memory.
 * supply a method to access the saved register information.
Does the kdump meet this requirment ? 
(I am not interesting to /proc/vmcore. Constructing the vmcore
 image is area of analysis tools. not kernel's task.)
Thanks.
