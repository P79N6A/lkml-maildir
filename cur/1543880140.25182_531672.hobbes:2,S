If there are another users, then flag should not be set.
If there are no another users, your code already has exclusive access.
One can not know if there will be any additional users at all (consider
the case when new encrypted block device or ipsec negotiation started
some time after module was loaded).

Some module is not allowed to force such restrictions, since it does not
know if there are other users or other algorithms.
You can call your algo with private company name hashed with author's
birtday, so no one in the world will be able to request such algo.
Actually its name can be read from /proc/crypto, but that is another
story.
