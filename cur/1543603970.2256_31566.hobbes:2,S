I don't think compatibility is an issue: programs that are (a) threaded
and (b) use the new thread group interface and (c) care about tid simply
do not exist. For the simple reason that they cannot exist - getpid() was
changed at the same time CLONE_THREAD was added.
So the only compatibility worry would be
 - people using non-thread-aware libraries together with a CLONE_THREAD
   core thing - which is possible especially if they have thread wrappers.
   But if those libraries care about "pid/tid" issues, there's no way that
   can have well-defined behaviour anyway ;)
 - people who have been playing with CLONE_THREAD, and have apps that
   depend on the "pid is the 'classical' pid, not the thread ID"
   behaviour. In which case adding a new gettid() is the right thing to
   do.
Now, I actually seriously doubt either of those are real issues, and it
probably doesn't matter what we do. But I'd ratehr have a system call
called "getpid()" do what POSIX threads have traditionally done, namely
give the ID of the process group ("tpid" in linux kernel-speak), and have
"gettid()" give the thread ID ("pid" in linux kernel-speak).
