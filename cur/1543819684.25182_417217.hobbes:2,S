Hi,
I'm a bit puzzled, I have a Fujistu-Siemens P7120 (see: 
http://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/index.php?page=p7120
) and the DVD-ROM 
wasn't detected at all at boot time.
After googling a bit I found this page: 
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Problems_with_SATA_and_Linux
So, I tried to compile the kernel with built-in ATAPI and S-ATA support 
(not as modules but embedded in the kernel) and I tried to pass 
libata.atapi_enabled=1 at boot time through kernel options. The 
DVD-drive was recognized at boot but generate tons of errors:
ata1: translated ATA stat/err 0x51/20 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0x3/11/04
ata1: no sense translation for error 0x20
ata1: no sense translation for status: 0x51
ata1: translated ATA stat/err 0x51/20 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0x3/11/04
sr0: CDROM (ioctl) error, command: <6>Test Unit Ready 00 00 00 00 00 00
sr: Current [descriptor]: sense key: Medium Error
     Additional sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed

ata1: no sense translation for error 0x20

Then I decided to just modify drivers/scsi/libata-core.c changing the 
line "atapi_enabled = 0" into "atapi_enabled = 1". Then everything 
worked as a charm.
I have no explanation yet for this behaviour (passing kernel options 
should behave the same than changing the code the way I did I suppose).
Does anyone has an idea ?
Regards
