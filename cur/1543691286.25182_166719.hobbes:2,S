You are misunderstanding the problem. You don't use bounce buffers just
because the page happens to reside in high memory, it is only used if
the hardware cannot DMA to it. And that is exactly the problem here with
the 3ware adapter, it cannot dma to > 4GB. So in a 6GB setup (with
potentially 5G of highmem), only the last 2G requires bouncing.
To answer one of the other questions regarding slowdown - it can be
nastier than 2x, remember that for reads the copy back happens inside
the interrupt handler... It would also be interesting to note (with
vmstat 1) whether it's all system time, or if you see something like
kswapd going crazy too. If the attached patch makes a difference, then
it could be a vm issue as well.
Still doesn't change that fact that if you build a machine with 6GB of
RAM and expect it to perform, then you don't add io controllers that
cannot DMA to all of your RAM.
