Thought I'd post some information about what I'm seeing running RH7.3 with 
kernel 2.4.20-rc1 on a brand new Dell Dimension 4550.  Currently there are 
two problems with the machine:
- When I swtich to a text console and back to the X screen, the machine locks 
up (or at least the console does not respond anymore).
- The sound driver does not load, although it seems to try.
I'm seeing the following lines of concern from the kernel:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
ICH4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev f9
PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
PCI: Found IRQ 9 for device 00:1f.1
PCI: Sharing IRQ 9 with 00:1d.2
ICH4: BIOS setup was incomplete.
ICH4: chipset revision 1
ICH4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
and:
Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.21, 15:48:58 Oct 29 2002
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:1f.5
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 00:1f.3
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 00:1f.5 to 64
i810: Intel ICH4 found at IO 0xcc40 and 0xc800, IRQ 11
i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 6 channels.
i810_audio: Primary codec not ready.
lspci -v for the devices of concern:

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'm happy to try out new 
patches.
