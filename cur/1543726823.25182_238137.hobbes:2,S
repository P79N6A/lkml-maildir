I was unable to boot -O2. It seemed to hang up when it got to the
aic7xxx(29160) scsi controller.
Boot messages copied by hand:
IRQ #16 thread started up.
delay 5 -10 secs
IRQ #19 thread started up.
delay 5 -10 secs
ahc_intr: HOST_MSG_LOOP bad phase 0x0
(repeats every 10-20 secs)
Waited a few minutes here before giving up and hitting reset.
Here is /proc/interrupts in 2.6.7-mm7

Also, had to turn of parport in the config to get it to compile.
