Hm. -Wall comprises -Wformat so I'd expect that gcc pukes on my feet. I
don't see how that behaviour should change with -W. After some
experimenting, it seems to me that -Wformat only checks the sizes of
the arguments, not their signedness. 
In my opinion, the compiler should warn about every little bit that
looks strange to it. Be it formats, be it signedness in assignments and
comparisons. 
It will be a painful work in some places however, I assume
:-)
