Using kernel xen-2.6.18-92.1.22.el5.i686 with 2010s results in kernel 
panic (not syncing).  The non-xen kernel is used in the initial 
kickstart.  After verifying grub, disk labels in rescue mode, etc, I am 
wondering if anyone has had success with the adaptec 2010s and xen?  The 
same hardware boots successfully with the smp 2.6.18-92.1.22.
