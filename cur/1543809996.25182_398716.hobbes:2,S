But this is the normal console behaviour in case of non existing replacement
glyph for some char. I just not changed it. Anyway if you have no '?' glyph
at '?' char code position you get some different char on the screen.
Replacement glyph should always be defined as I said before,
so this part of code could be easilly removed but I do not really know
if this assumption is true now.
