Yes that is what the patch was doing and it was for a specific reason. On
a Core 2 Duo (which uses the 2nd generation of the architectural PMU), some
useful features (such as PEBS) requiree the use of counter 0 so we cannot
give it away to NMI.
Now on Core Duo, there is no PEBS anyway, so it is okay to use counter 0
for NMI. The problem is that the detection code in perfctr-watchdog.c
treats a Core Duo and a Core 2 Duo the same way as they both have the
X86_FEATURE_ARCH_PERFMON bit set.
I have attached a patch with handle the case of the Core Duo. Unfortunately,
I do not own one so I cannot test it. I would appreciate if you could
try re-applying my counter 0 -> 1 patch + this new one to see if you
have the problem with the NMI getting stuck.
The patch below is probably still needed to handle the case where you get
stuck.
Thanks.
