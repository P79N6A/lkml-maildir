Well, the reason why I sent the patch to both, the maintainer of the driver
and the maintainers of the trees, is that the maintainers of the trees have
the opportunity to fix one of the more important drivers before they release a
new "official" version that is broken here, and I think that the change is
quite obvious.
To clarify this: I don't care whether and when the fix goes to the official
trees, because I have the fix for my personal kernel builds and Hubert Mantel
has it for the SuSE builds, so it Works-For-Me(TM).
