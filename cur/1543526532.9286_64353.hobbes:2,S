It does matter.
Since all the time you are holding the lock you remain in kernel.
All the time you remain in kernel prevents schedules, even if an
interrupt
awakes a process with higher priority.
To get working multimedia (like audio) any code executing in kernel for
more than a few microseconds may give you problems.
Ingo Molnar has prepared some patches that helps. (Nothing released
for 2.3 yet)
