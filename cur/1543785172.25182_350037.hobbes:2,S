And with dynamic HZ?
Do you want
a) The HZ that was used when we booted
b) The HZ that is currently used (say 22, but could be 573 in 0.1s)
c) The MIN HZ (if there is such a thing and it is configured)
   that the kernel will use.
d) The MAX HZ (same) that the kernel will use.
Or do you want USER_HZ?
Or are you after something else entirely.
