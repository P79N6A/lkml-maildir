Since 2.4 is basically frozen, and said patches are only performance
optimisations and not functionality enhancements I would think this is a bad
idea; if you need the small performance gain, 2.6 is imo a far better place
nowadays. The 2.4 SCSI stack seems rather stable and destabilizing it this
late in the cycle sounds bad with the alternative of 2.6 being available.
