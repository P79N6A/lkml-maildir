cisco:
interface Loopback1
 ip address 192.168.128.1 255.255.240.0
 no ip directed-broadcast
the dev loopback1 used as example.

Linux.
and yes, i have seen supernetted interfaces on a few of those.

the term is supernet, not reverse subnet. :)
`RFC' is a request for comments.  'tis generally accepted that these are
standards by which we go.  they're made as we need them.  they're discussed
and commented on and reworked until we're happy with them.
as networking evolves we need to change our standards to properly accomodate.
i'm sure there are instances where it is beneficial to have a non segmented
supernet.  there are generally instances of many exceptions.
using a supernet doesn't make it 'wrong' but simply a different approach.
consider the near future when everything in your house will have an IP. 
it's a foolish though that the number of objects will be less than 254, and
probably foolish to consider that they should be segmented.  the traffic is
likely to be low, just high object count.
before saying it is illegal or wrong to supernet an interface, simply
consider what is technically detrimental.  lack of supernetted
interface/route support?  make it happen.
'256' is a figure based on an octet.  an octet based on demand.  look at
transport protocols.  a 53 byte cell for transmission?  why such an
oddity..because the math warranted it.  how about the 1500 MTU.  it's a
figure of the time.
all these figures usually have excellent reasoning behind them however, they
were designed yesterday.  if our needs are changing, the numbers need to
accomodate them.
in my previous article, i mentioned adding 128 routes for a /17 supernet. 
that was an aside.  giving a little thought i'm sure you the reader can come
up with the multi gateway setup required for a /17 supernet and not allowing
supernetted interfaces.
