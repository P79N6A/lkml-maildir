Some platforms try to "unify" the pin setup in the boot loader.
Most of them cope with bogus bootloaders by doing it in the board
setup code.
I don't know of any who try to do it "late" as you summarized.
See above why "late" unification is not necessarily as good as
"early" unification.
And then there's the OMAP1 example, where for example you might
know that you want MPUIO-0 but that's insufficient to tell whether
you must mux ball F18 or R13 ... so it's impossible to do the kind
of "late" unification done here, and pinmux *MUST* be separate from
IRQ setup.
