Well, ncheck finished.

It does not look like a directory to me. Unfortunately, as we
do not have coherent /dev/hda3 cache, I have no idea how to read
real contents of /var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci, but
ls -l /var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci/ reemited error message about
ext2-fs error, so I think that it is real problem, and my tmp.ci directory
contains some file contents instead. And I'm 100% sure that
/var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci was created with patched kernel :-(
