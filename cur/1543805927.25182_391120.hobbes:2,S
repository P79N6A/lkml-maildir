Some machines have millions of entries in their route cache.
I suspect we cannot queue all them (or only hash heads as your previous patch) 
by RCU. Latencies and/or OOM can occur.
What can be done is :
in rt_run_flush(), allocate a new empty hash table, and exchange the hash tables.
Then wait a quiescent/grace RCU period (may be the exact term is not this one, 
sorry, I'm not RCU expert)
Then free all the entries from the old hash table (direclty of course, no need 
for RCU grace period), and free the hash table.
As the hash table can be huge, we might need allocate it at boot time, just in 
case a flush is needed (it usually is :) ). If we choose dynamic allocation 
and this allocation fails, then fallback to what is done today.
