In the latest -mm series file, they start at
mm-revert-kernel_ds-buffered-write-optimisation.patch
...
and go to
ocfs2-convert-to-new-aops.patch

OK. The write_begin/write_end patchset is intrusive, no question. I'm not sure
what you're intending to do with it. They have been tested in -mm for quite a
while now, but just going with a simple patch that tries to copy more segments
might be OK for you if you're backporting. The deadlock is pretty uncommon.
