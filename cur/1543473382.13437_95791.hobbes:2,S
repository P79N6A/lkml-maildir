It appears that NFS Server 2.2beta37 does not show this effect,
and yes, the removal of a directory, that is sometimes nonempty,
is involved in the test.
So it is likely a bug/feature of NFS Server 2.2beta29, but it may be
worth to check what happens with knfsd as server, the source
of the test program is at
