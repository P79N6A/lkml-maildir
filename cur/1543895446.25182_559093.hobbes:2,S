IANAL but I think a second, probably fictional but not unrealistic scenario. A 
Linux-based in-car entertainment system. I believe there are laws in certain 
countries that require the front screens to be off when the car is in motion 
to prevent the driver from being distracted.
Assume that the hardware does not prevent the user from uploading modified 
software (with the restriction removed) and the user modified the system and 
then causes a crash with fatalities.
I imagine there are countries where a civil case could be brought against the 
manufacturer for failing to provide reasonable safeguards against disabling 
the safety feature.
Cheers,
Marek
