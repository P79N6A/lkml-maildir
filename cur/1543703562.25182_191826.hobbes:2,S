I couldn't google the original suggestion from Eli Biham.  The verbiage 
of the email ( hearsay, thrice removed ) seemed to indicate the proposal 
was to defend against a DA.
I'm curious. What attack would it defend against?  The extra IV of zeros 
might make it harder to attack a weak cipher with known plaintext 
through differential cryptanalysis, iff the first IV was mostly zeros  ( 
I'm grasping at straws here ).
That's about all I can think of. But then again; I wasn't on the Popular 
Science "Brilliant 10" list.
;^)  Belated Congratulations, David.
