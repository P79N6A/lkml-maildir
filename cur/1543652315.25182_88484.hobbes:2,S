Subject: [PATCH] restore framebuffer console after suspend

Marcelo,
this patch fixes the case when a laptop was suspended and resumed while a 
framebuffer console was active, the console would not be redrawn.
After a discussion with Benjamin Herrenschmidt, we both agree that this 
patch is the best solution. It is the same as my first patch with this 
subject, just resent because there was some confusion about which patch was 
best.
Please apply for 2.4.20-rc2.
Thanks
Carl-Daniel
