Thanks, but this is still going to go through changes, from your comments
as well as your latest patches.

One reason was that the caller was an addition. I originally didn't have
it, but during my tests, the output was basically useless. It didn't give
any hint to where things went wrong, so I added it. The CRC is to check
the rcu is working, not really the checker itself.
Note, it helped us out lately with Peter's latest file_table patches in
-rt. With this patch applied, it triggered corruption. That was due to the
union in the fs.h between the llist and rcu_head there was a dependency
in the llist where the rcu_head would not grow. The llist can still do a
spin lock on the lock _after_ the item was added to the call_rcu. Because
of that union, the locking of the lock corrupted the crc. Set it to one.
You'll see patches from Peter soon to get rid of that dependency.

Paul, I'm disappointed in you. That number doesn't ring a bell at all??
(hint, ignore the 'C' that was added by me).

Why? probably because I was half asleep when writing it ;-)

I added that because during testing, it would flood the serial console. I
can modify this to whatever deems fit.  Perhaps more hits will give a
better clue to what went wrong. I could also just add a print_ratelimit to
it too.

Would you prefer the above or the print_ratelimit? Maybe 10 would be best.
I really don't have a preference.

I believe that I tried to keep all the checks done in the same locations
that could possible modify the lists. So they should be protect by the
same mechanism.  On the rcupreempt side, I made the checks within the
holding of the data lock (for when you see that patch ;-)

Yeah, I can scrap those initialization macros. That came about my first
attempt where I forgot to add the assignment to the call_rcu and it
obviously failed.  So I added these macros, and it stilled failed. Then I
saw the mistake I made, fixed it, and it worked. But I never removed these
macros.  I think we can just keep the crc as zero. That would also fail
the test. Hmm, maybe we should add a BAD_CRC number so that it will give
us a hint that something was initiazed incorrectly.

Paul, thanks for all the comments. I'll put out a new round of patches
after yours becomes offical (no "not for inclussion" statements).
