Thanks for the patch.  Please split this up and cc
linux-crypto@vger.kernel.org.

This isn't right.  The alignmask applies to source/destination buffers
only.  The only requirement on the key is that it must always be
32-bit aligned.

Good catch.

We should extend alignmask to cover this and handle it in the digest
layer.
