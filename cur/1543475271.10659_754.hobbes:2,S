YaST is not free software. And I'm definitely not want to have such software
as heart of my system.

There are difference: there are just a few current versions of solaris, aix,
irix, etc. But there are HUNDREDS of linux distributions. ia32-linux-lsb1.0
will be Ok, ia32-redhat-linux5.2 is not...

No. You need LSB-compatibility for that.
PB> It doesn't matter what the FS standard says.
It IS matter. If FHS (LSB when LSB will be ready) says one thing and in real
distribution there are other then then DISTRIBUTION should be fixed. Just like
POSIX: if something in Linux kernel works against the POSIX this means that
kernel should be changed, not POSIX.

Software should be LSB-compatible. That's all. This is the only possible
solution for creating software without creating hundred versions for each
and every distribution...
