It isn't a problem that CAN show reliably, if it is OOM related.
(Arguably, it isn't even a problem.) Your code is using memory in a
particular way; if there isn't any memory, it fails.
Causing this particular (valid, AFAICS) use of memory to be a problem
in itself would prevent the symptom above showing - but do you really
want or need that?
