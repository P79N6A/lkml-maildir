I have here on a machine a flash card reader with a PCI id 1524:0510.
In a verbose mode from 'lspci' it identifies itself as
00:10.1 FLASH memory: ENE Technology Inc: Unknown device 0510
	Subsystem: Asustek Computer, Inc.: Unknown device 1724
	Control: I/O+ Mem- BusMaster- SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
	Status: Cap+ 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
	Interrupt: pin B routed to IRQ 3
	Region 0: I/O ports at 8400 [size=128]
	Capabilities: [a0] Power Management version 2
		Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1+ D2+ AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0+,D1+,D2+,D3hot+,D3cold-)
		Status: D0 PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-
This seems to be somewhat integrated with a bus controller 1524:1411, a.k.a
00:10.0 CardBus bridge: ENE Technology Inc: Unknown device 1411 (rev 01)
	Subsystem: ENE Technology Inc: Unknown device 1411
A Windows driver (at least 0510 part of it) treats that as some
kind of a SCSI device.
So far I cannot make Linux with 2.4.x kernels to recognize that
gizmo.  Does anybody know if there is a device driver which would
make this workable in Linux?
Apparently some details about it one can find in

   Thanks,
