   Any news on ext3 filesystem?? Where can I get info?
There is a 0.01 release which came out 1-2 weeks ago.  It was against
2.2.2, and has bugs which have since been fixed.  I imagine that Stephen
will be releasing a new version fairly shortly.
So the good news is that most of the code has been written but we still
need to do some bugfixing (and bug finding) before it will be completely
production ready.
