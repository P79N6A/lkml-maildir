I missed the other reference in another patch.  But the central point
still stands: if all you do is atomic_set() and atomic_read(), then
using atomic_t doesn't buy you anything.  Just look at what
atomic_read() expands to -- using it isn't protecting you against
anything, so either you have a race, or you were safe without
atomic_t.  The only point to atomic_t is so that you can safely do
read-modify-write things like atomic_inc().
