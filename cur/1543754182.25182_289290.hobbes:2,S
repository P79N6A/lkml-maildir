Ok, I found following in the archive:

This causes the following compile error:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      drivers/superio/built-in.o
drivers/superio/sc_acb.o(.text+0x0): In function `sc_write_reg':
: multiple definition of `sc_write_reg'
drivers/superio/sc_gpio.o(.text+0x0): first defined here
drivers/superio/sc_acb.o(.text+0x30): In function `sc_read_reg':
: multiple definition of `sc_read_reg'
drivers/superio/sc_gpio.o(.text+0x30): first defined here
make[2]: *** [drivers/superio/built-in.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The trivial fix for these needlessly global functions is below.
BTW1: pin_test.c is added but completely unused.
BTW2: bk-i2c adds a whole bunch of unused SuperIO EXPORT_SYMBOL's.
      Is usage for them expected very soon or shall I send a patch to 
      remove them?
<--  snip  -->
This patch makes needlessly global functions static fixing a compile 
error if both sc_acb.c and sc_gpio.c are compiled statically into the 
kernel.
*********************************
It is not Greg, but completely my fault and I agree with your changes.
pin_test.c was added as example of how to use SuperIO subsystem, 
it is not supposed to be compiled, it is an example, probably it should 
live in Documentation/superio/example.c
Tahnk you for review.
