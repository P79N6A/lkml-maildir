Mmm.. I'm not so sure about that.
In the case of CF cards in ide-cs, removing the card is equivalent
to removing the entire IDE controller, not just the media.
So "media change" is not what happens here.
But yes, it still should be managed as a removable device,
but we currently seem to be using this bit to mean two things,
as explained by Russell in the given link.
