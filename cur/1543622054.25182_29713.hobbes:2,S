	Yes, I am using the 80pin cable. The BP6 board has the normal IDE
controller and the HPT controller. The normal IDE controller which I said
was the common 40pin one. The DMA66 cable, certainly, is the 80 pin.
	I cannot use the 80pin cable with the normal IDE for it does not
fit. But I tried with two 80-pin cables.
	Thanks,
