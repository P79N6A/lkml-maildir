NVidia chipsets are known to have problems when used with
local APIC or I/O-APIC. We don't know exactly what happens,
but it looks like a hardware or BIOS problem. The only
known cure is to try combinations of:
upgrade BIOS
pci=noacpi
acpi=off
noapic
nolapic
FWIW, VIA's K8T800 chipset seems to work very well.
