Though to be fair, it's smart to concentrate on the high end with a
view to achieving world domination sooner.  And it's a stretch to call
the low end performance 'slow'.
An idea that's looking more and more attractive as time goes by is to
have a global config option that specifies that we want to choose the
simple way of doing things wherever possible, over the enterprise way.
We want this especially for embedded.  On low end processors, it's even
possible that the small way will be faster in some cases than the
enterprise way, due to cache effects.
