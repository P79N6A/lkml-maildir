Dear Kernel developers,
I am running 2.6.19.2 kernel on ASUS W2V laptop and I have the
following boot messages"
....
PCI: Transparent bridge - 0000:00:1e.0
PCI: Bus #04 (-#07) is hidden behind transparent bridge #03 (-#04)
(try 'pci=assign-busses')
Please report the result to linux-kernel to fix this permanently
....
Could you fix the problem? Please, find attached dmesg reports with
and without pci-assign-busses option. Also I have attached lspci
output for your convenience.
Please, ask for any additional information you need via ved@lenta.ru
Thanking you beforehand for your cooperation,
Vladislav
