this does seem to be similar to other reports where the cause of such 
latencies was some sort of hardware-level latency. (DMA related delays 
or other, bus-arbitration related delays)
another possibility is that something interesting happened on another 
CPU while this latency occured - to debug this please enable all-CPUs 
tracing:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_all_cpus
and send me a new trace.
