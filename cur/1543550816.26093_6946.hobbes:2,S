2.2 and 2.4 are not the same anymore with ide-pci init.
2.4 got broken.
In case you have not read, the backport is suspended for now.
So you can not have you UltraDMA in 2.2 if you wanted.
Instead of bitching about the problem, way not attempt to narrow the scope
where you think is was broken.
OH, and to hell with laptops for a while!
