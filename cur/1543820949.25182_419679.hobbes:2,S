Subject: [PATCH 003 of 5] md: Change ENOTSUPP to EOPNOTSUPP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/27/417

Because that is what you get if a BIO_RW_BARRIER isn't supported !
