Likely - and I think you would have to do that anyway, otherwise how are 
you going to prevent the ACPI code from concurrently accessing the EC at 
the same time as the HDAPS driver? In any case, only ACPI knows how to 
safely access the EC (Global Lock needed, or not) so it should be the 
one doing the accesses.
