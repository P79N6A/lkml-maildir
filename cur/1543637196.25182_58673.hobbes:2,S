This is definitely a bad entry - offset + rec_len (4100) != blocksize (4096).
Strange.  You need to run e2fsck -f on this partition.  It sounds like
you are getting some corruption or bit flips happening.

Well, this is an error, and the next time the computer is restarted it
should force a full fsck on the partition.  The other "panic" (oops)
situations are when things are totally shot and it is better to stop
doing anything than try and continue.  In this case, it is possible to
continue, but that doesn't mean things are OK.
Cheers, Andreas
