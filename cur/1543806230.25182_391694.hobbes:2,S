Very nice paths - thanks!
I have applied it locally and will commit if it when testing a bit more.

Here you replace 
	echo 'xxx' && cmd
with
	echo 'xxx'; cmd
Since we assume echo will always succeed I see no difference in
behaviour, but I recall the '&&' was there for some specific reason.
Just wondering why it is so - I see no problems with it.
