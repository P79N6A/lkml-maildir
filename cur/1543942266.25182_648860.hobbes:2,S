At first glance, I like it.  Thanks.
The changes in the exact behaviour of set_mempolicy (and mbind?) seem
to me to be changes for the better -- subtle improvements in the
consistency of handling corner cases.
However I don't have code that depends all that elaborately on the
fine details of these system calls, so I'm easy.  If others know of
an existing or likely usage pattern that this patch would break,
that would be interesting input.
Thanks, Lee.
