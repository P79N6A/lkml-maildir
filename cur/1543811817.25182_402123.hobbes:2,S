So even if the battery lasts longer, you don't have anything of it, 'cause
the CPU can even compute _less_ in this longer time-span. Remember that
idling doesn't count...

Yes and no. The heat production is more levelled if you use throttling, so
the temperature achieved is lesser, which might cause fans not having to
start or air conditioning having less work to do.
