Sorry, but as the patch is a complete new implementation the patch file 
is almost 110KB long. So I thought it might be a better idea to just 
post an URL.
Also the "Documentation/SubmittingPatches" file in the kernel tree does 
suggest to just post an URL if the files are too large. And IMHO 110KB 
is quite large, isn't it? ;)
But if someone wants me to submitt the whole patchfile, I can of course 
do so.
cheers,
jens
