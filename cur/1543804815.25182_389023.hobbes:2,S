I think you're being unreasonable here.
Removing unused code from the kernel, I'm all for that. Really.
But this is userspace visible functionality, and more care needs to be
taken than just adding a few lines to an obscure file in the kernel.
I agree with Ben that the kernel needs to printk a stern warning *AT USE
OF THE FEATURE* for at least a year before such a feature can be
removed. In addition I think that in case such a feature isn't actually
harmful of further development (for example, it could be because it's
fundamentally broken locking wise, or holding back major improvements)
then a longer period of warnings should be no problem. Together with
that should probably be something to ask distros to stop enabling the
feature asap, or at least communicate it as deprecated in their
respective release notes.
