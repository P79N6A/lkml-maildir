Sending 33k of warning messages at once to a generic mailing list is
unlikely to get you anywhere. If you really want these warnings to get
fixed, you better find the right person to report each warning.
Otherwise your report has very little value.

Deprecation warnings are aimed at other developers, users can ignore
them safely. They will go away as soon as the deprecated symbols are no
longer used.
