Speaking of Nvidia, I have a Nvidia GeForce2, and had problems loading 
the NV kernel module with a patched test10 kernel (i was running test9 
before).  I took a look at the test10 patch, and noticed the following 2 
lines were taken out of  <linux_dir>/include/linux/wrapper.h:
#define mem_map_inc_count(p) atomic_inc(&(p->count))
#define mem_map_dec_count(p) atomic_dec(&(p->count))
I added those two defines back into wrapper.h and then was able to load 
the NVdriver successfully, with no problems. This doesn't appear to 
break compiliation of the test10 kernel either. I thought I'd let 
everyone know if anyone was having problems with the NV kernel driver. 
Please note, I am not a C programmer, but more of a C hacker, and this 
worked for me on my Slackware 7.1 machine. I have no idea what this may 
have broken in the kernel or whatnot. I only know that this fixed the 
problem on this particular box with the NV kernel driver, so proceed at 
your own risk ;-)
