Ok. Bernard did not test it:
<cite>
In fact, due to distro version differences between mine and the one
installed on my friends linuxbox (I was running Mandriva 2006 with 2.6
kernel and he had a Knoppix system with 2.4 kernel), I did not had the
opportunity to check if the new version sent by Moxa support worked
before he disappeared.
But I dont see any reason it would not. Moxa guys have all the hardware
in their development departement to check their product drivers.
I just verified that 1.9.1 driver source could be compiled under kernel
2.6. and so did it.

So, what do you expect me to do, Andrew? Add just pci_ids + its config with no 
int->ulong conversion + writing ~UART_IER_THRI to the port?
thanks,
