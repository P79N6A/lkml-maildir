Obviously you
(a) Don't want to actually try to compile and run it.
It will run. For Tomasz, it runs ok with 3-insn instruction sequence
instead of enter. For me, it works just fine with enter. But it works.
Why do you think it is not enough?
(b) can't do 32-bit math. You made two mistakes.
    -12 is 0xfffffff4, not 0xfffffff3.
    0xafff0000 + 0xfffffff4 = 0xaffefff4, not 0xfafff00d
and
(c) do not realize that 32bit i386+ CPUs check segment limits
    AFTER performing 32bit math (i.e. overflow into 33th bit
    is truncated instead of triggering limit violation)
