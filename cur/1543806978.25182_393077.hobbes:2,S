If people don't want this confusion, why do they start with a new system?
libscg & cdrecord have been available long before Linux HAL was there.
And the most important argument here is that it is extremely unlikely that
this Linux HAL will handle all oddities of all CD/DVD-writers, do it is 
unapropriate to use this interface in case that you like to get more 
information than just "the drive is there".
Note that UNIX people usually believe that is is best practice to have this 
kind of software intergrated in the kernel (or at leat in the system). This is 
what FreeBSD did try for some years, and FreeBSD has failed with this attempt.
