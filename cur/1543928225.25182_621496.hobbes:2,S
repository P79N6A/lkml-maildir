No, I was the one who moved exports near their declarations.  That's 
organised.  I just don't see how this new "organization" will help: oh good, 
I won't accidentally use the udp functions any more?!?

Perhaps you've got lots of patches were people are using internal APIs they 
shouldn't?

Well, introduce an EXPORT_SYMBOL_INTERNAL().  It's a lot less code.  But you'd 
still need to show that people are having trouble knowing what APIs to use.

There is no "exported API" to bring under control.  There are symbols we 
expose for the kernel's own use which can be used by external modules at 
their own risk.

No.  That's the wrong question.  What's the real upside?
Let's not put code in the core because "it doesn't seem to hurt".
I'm sure you think there's a real problem, but I'm still waiting for someone 
to *show* it to me.  Then we can look at solutions.
