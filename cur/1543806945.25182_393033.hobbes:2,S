It'd be nice if this one was included; we're using this in a set of
kernel patches which we deliver to a customer who needs a real-time
Linux solution, and we're using it for the same reason that
RHEL/Fedora is; it's really handy when rebasing to the latest kernel.
(Note to Michael Loftis re: the original thread: ++ to a list of "real
companies" that are using and tracking bleeding edge kernels for a
customer deliverable.  It _is_ doable if you aren't spending all of
your time whining....)
