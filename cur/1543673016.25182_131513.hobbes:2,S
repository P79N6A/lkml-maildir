It doesn't need a PTE.  The vsyscall code could be _copied_ to the end
of the page at 0xbffff000, with the stack immediately preceding it.
In fact that's 1 fewer TLB entries than the current arrangement.  The
fork-time copy should be negligable as it is a very small code
fragment.
I suspect this would cause difficulties with the latest ELF and unwind
tables, but apart from that, why _not_ place the vsyscall trampoline
at the end of the stack?
