No. It got snipped but I introduced the comment by saying it was a "that's 
not the point" kind of thing. Sometimes things that aren't the point are 
still true though and in the case of Linux desktop users complaining about 
updatedb runs, a comment that says that for many an obvious solution would 
be to stop running the damned thing is not in any sense illogical.
Also note I'm not against swap prefetch or anything. I don't use it and do 
not believe I have a pressing need for it, but do suspect it has potential 
to make quite a bit of difference on some things -- if only to drastically 
reduce seeks if it means it's swapping in larger chunks than a randomly 
faulting program would.
Rene.
