Again, move inclusion of arch's Makefile after CFLAGS setting - I remember
merging the same patch eons ago in 2.6, so I added a comment.
I discovered this because debug info weren't enabled for USER_OBJS - they're
compiled with USER_CFLAGS which is calculated from CFLAGS (the whole thing is a
bit of an hack but fixing it is not easy, so we're leaving it as-is).
