That ordering is back to how it was before I adjusted it
for reuse_swap_page()'s delete_from_swap_cache(), isn't it?
So I don't understand how you've fixed the bug I hit (not an
accounting imbalance but an oops or BUG, I forget) with this
ordering, without making some other change elsewhere.
mem_cgroup_commit_charge_swapin calls swap_cgroup_record with
bogus swp_entry_t 0, which appears to belong to swp_offset 0 of
swp_type 0, but the ctrl->map for type 0 may have been freed
ages ago (we do always start from 0, but maybe we swapped on
type 1 and swapped off type 0 meanwhile).  I'm guessing that
by looking at the code, not by retesting it, so I may have the
details wrong; but I didn't reorder your code just for fun.
Perhaps your restored ordering works if you check PageSwapCache
in mem_cgroup_commit_charge_swapin or check 0 in swap_cgroup_record,
but I don't see that in yesterday's mmotm, nor in this patch.
(And I should admit, I've not even attempted to follow your
accounting justification: I'll leave that to you memcg guys.)
An alternative could be not to clear page->private when deleting
from swap cache, that's only done for tidiness and to force notice
of races like this; but I'd want a much stronger reason to change that.
Or am I making this up?  As I say, I've not tested it this time around.
