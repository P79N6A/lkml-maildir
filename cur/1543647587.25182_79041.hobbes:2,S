Hi Pavel,
	shouldn't this kinda thing be handled by the driver model layer? 
Ditto for the device walk and suspend in suspend.c. Also what do you 
think of adding hooks to driver model tree so that we can add additional 
handlers for things like this with the driver model doing the final 
suspend as specified in the driver.
