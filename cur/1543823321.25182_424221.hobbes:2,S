Subject: [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.3.3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.3.3 is available at the
usual places:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
	git-1.3.3.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
	RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.3.3-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
This contains two notable non-fixes:
 (1) Future-proofing configuration file syntax by Linus.
     Nothing in 1.3.X series takes advantage of it, but it is
     there so 1.3.3 would not barf in a repository that you
     previously used later versions of git to manipulate its
     configuration file.
 (2) core.prefersymlinkrefs configuration can be set in the
     configuration file while bisecting a project that wants to
     use .git/HEAD symbolic link in its historical version
     (notably Linux kernel around January this year).
