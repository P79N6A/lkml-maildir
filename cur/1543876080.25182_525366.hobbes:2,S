Yes, but the padlock driver is located under drivers/crypto. The s390
crypto stuff is not. It is under arch/s390/crypto, thats why the Kconfig
file is there...
Both solutions (the current and your proposed) are somehow ugly. 
I don't care too much, where the Kconfig entries are, as long as it
works. So if you're interested in changing it go forward and post a
patch...
