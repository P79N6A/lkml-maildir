	I can't speak to the trademark issue. I don't know enough about how the GPL
deals with possible trademark issues. I believe you could not embed
trademarked images into the kernel and distribute the result either.
	However, this is a pure copyright issue. You cannot combine GPL'd code with
code that has a more restrictive license and distribute the resulting
binaries. Read GPL section 2b:
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet *all* of these conditions:
...
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
	How can you cause the Linux kernel combined with this firmware to be
licensed under the terms of the GPL? (And, by the way, I think this
prohibits trademark as well, which is very interesting.)
	DS
