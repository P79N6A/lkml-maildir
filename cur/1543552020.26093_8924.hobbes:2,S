nope
A plain K6:
   model           : AMD-K6tm w/ multimedia extensions
A K6-2:
   model name      : AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor
A K6-3:
   model name      : AMD-K6(tm) 3D+ Processor
A K6-2+:
  model name      : AMD-K6(tm)-III Processor
This isn't done by linux; as far as I know these strings are on the chip
and set by AMD.
It tends to be confusing, but the value you get is proper for your chip.
