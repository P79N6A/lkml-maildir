since i modified it to enable magic keys, yes, every time i tried to 
output Regs (sysrq-P), the same outputs. i will keep observing and 
reporting, if cases with different output appear.

unfortunately, the cpu on this machine is busy for the next few days, so i 
cannot recompile the kernel right now ... i will recompile disabling 
cachefs as soon as i have the resources for it (we all know, students 
have limited resources, especially students interested in 
bioinformatics). ... or is there a way to disable cachefs on the run 
(without recompiling/rebooting)? 
untill then, remaining with best regards,
Damir
