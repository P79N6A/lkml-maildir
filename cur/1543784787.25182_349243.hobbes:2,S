Thanks. Nobody should ever do a byte write to that offset, but clearly 
something does.
And yes, that's what I missed even though I quoted it from the hpt366
driver (heh, and nobody else noticed either):
        /* FIXME: Not portable */
        if (dev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE].start)
                pci_write_config_byte(dev, PCI_ROM_ADDRESS,
                        dev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE].start | PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE);
I wonder how long that has been like that.
Change the pci_write_config_byte() into a pci_write_config_dword(), and I 
bet it works. 
However, I _also_ suspect it works if you remove those lines entirely. I 
don't see why it tries to enable the ROM in the first place - it doesn't 
seem to be _using_ it.
