I? A 32bit interface to the kernel? Why do you think I want one?
The discussion has become too long, and people react to single
sentences in a reply instead of reading the thread.
[This started when I answered Andrew and wrote about a dev_t:
8+8 when 16-bit, otherwise 16+16 when 32-bit, otherwise 32+32.
Look: no kernel involved. No interface involved.
This structure is defined by <sys/sysmacros.h>.]
