Here are some results on a 12 way machine. (2.4.16-splay is the radix
patch):

As you can see both patches give pretty much equal improvements.
The other problem with the current pagecache hash is that it maxes out
at order 9 (due to the get_free_pages limitation) which starts to hurt
at 4GB RAM and above. On a 32GB machine the average hashchain depth
was very high:

There were a few solutions (from davem and ingo) to allocate a larger
hash but with the radix patch we no longer have to worry about this.
So the radix patch solves 2 problems quite nicely :)
