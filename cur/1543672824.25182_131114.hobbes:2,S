I... do not think so. 
You'd then need
.compat_linux32_ioctl
.compat_IBCS2_ioctl
...
I do not think that is doable.

That makes more sense. Unfortunately, that means that case "okay, it
is compatible" can not be told from "we did not bother to check
compat_task()". :-(. Nor do I see a transition phase.
