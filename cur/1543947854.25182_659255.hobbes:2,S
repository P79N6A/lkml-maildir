Hi Sam,
you know I've just take a look on different architectures and I suddenly
realized that I even can't test my changes I'm bringnin in. For example -
xtensa arch, most of lds numeric constants could (and should) be changed
to PAGE_SIZE and THREAD_SIZE but this requires to include additional
heades in lds script and I'm not even sure if it link without errors...
(actually, i'm absolutely sure there would be errors ;)
I'm not sure, but maybe it would be more convenient to ask mainteiners
fix their scripts? At least their have access to an appropriate hardware
to test.
