Hello list,
My first post to the linux-kernel mailing list - a little report on 
mouse hang experiences on a PS/2 mouse :-)
Since the change from 2.6.14 to 2.6.16_rc1, I got mouse hangs using a 
first-generation MS IntelliEye Explorer with USB->PS2 converter, no KVM, 
which ran smoothly on the official 2.6.14.
The syslog message is ...
   psmouse.c: resync failed, issuing reconnect request
and I have the exact symptoms - hang after about 10 sec mouse 
inactivity, then after 2 secs it's back to normal - as described in the 
thread ...

   Subject  Mouse stalls (again) with 2.6.15-mm2
   between Jesper Juhl and Dmitry Torokhov.
   (

)
and a statement by Dmitry was to do resync retries every few seconds for 
KVM users.
This certainly is a good idea for KVM users, but since Jesper and me are 
counter-examples to this frequent resyncing, I suggest that this is made 
an option in the kernel, like "KVM fixes - resync mouse in background".
I personally had to turn off resyncing using the suggested
   echo -n 0 > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/resync_time
to get back the expected fluent behavior, since without a KVM, there is 
no automatic resyncing required ...
Of course I stand ready for corrections or for giving more detailed info 
if required.
