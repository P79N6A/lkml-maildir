it's the first oops that matters. You could try to 'freeze' the system 
after printing the first stacktrace, via the patch below - but debugging 
boot-time crashes without logging support is a quite tedious process.
(maybe, if the crash happens after the ethernet card is detected, you 
could try netconsole logging.)
