if you select 4g for chunk size, we don't need to convert that from
continuous to discrete to make X server driver happen.
actually the code could support any chunk_size...
for example: 16 g system
orginal:
0-4g WB
3.5g-4g UC
4g-8g WB
8g-16g WB
16g-16.5g WB
if you set chunk size to 16g, and gran size <= 512M
you will get
0-16g WB
3.5g-4g UC
16g-16.5g WB
