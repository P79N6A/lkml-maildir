I've been collecting information on this as well, as I've been
maintaining a patch to support deferred coalescing in the page-level
allocator. Martin Bligh contributed the code to collect some
fragmentation statistics for that patch, which was originally written
for mainline 2.4. It's slightly less expensive in lazy_buddy, as the
algorithm requires some accounting anyway, but some other statistics
besides population counts for various block sizes might also be useful
to track here. I'm holding off until I read up on seq_file() and convert
the /proc/ reporting over to it before the next release of it, though I
do have more current diffs than I've announced. I wouldn't mind at all
hearing from those who have more stringent fragmentation requirements.
Cheers,
Bill
