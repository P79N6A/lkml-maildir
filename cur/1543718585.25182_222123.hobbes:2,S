Yes, that solved the problem! Thanks a lot for that fast fix! I'm glad 
that's finally resolved.
There is one more annoying thing with the hfsplus driver: the handling 
of HFSPLUS_VOL_INCNSTNT.
It seem that both Mac OS X's mount/unmount routines and fsck_hfs don't 
ever read or write this bit, in violation of Apple's own 
specifications. This means that when linux crashes, a mounted hfs+ 
volumes will from then on have the INCONSTNT bit set and linux will 
refuse to mount it read-write, even after Mac OS X fscked it and 
mounted it read/write. This situation can be resolved by running 
hpmount on that volume, which clears the INCONSTNT bit, but that's not 
user-friendly. I therefore propose this simple patch:
