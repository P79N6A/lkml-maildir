disabling both CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC fixed the
suspend/resume problem.  I haven't confirmed whether or not
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC alone brings back the problem -- will let you know.
the dmi settings are:
    DMI 2.3 present. 
    DMI table at 0x000E0010. 
/proc/cpuinfo comes up as:
    processor	: 0
    vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
    cpu family	: 6
    model		: 8
    model name	: Pentium III (Coppermine)
    stepping	: 6
    cpu MHz		: 696.980
    cache size	: 256 KB
    fdiv_bug	: no
    hlt_bug		: no
    f00f_bug	: no
    coma_bug	: no
    fpu		: yes
    fpu_exception	: yes
    cpuid level	: 2
    wp		: yes
    flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 sep mtrr pge mca cmov
    pat pse36 mmx fxsr sse
    bogomips	: 1389.36
thanks for all your help.
