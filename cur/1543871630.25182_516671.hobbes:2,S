OK, I'd forgotten about that.  It won't break dirty memory accounting,
but it'll potentially break dirty memory balancing.
If we have the wrong page (due to nonlinear), page_check_address() will
fail and we'll leave the pte dirty.  That puts us back to the pre-2.6.17
algorithms and I guess it'll break the msync guarantees.
Peter, I thought we went through the nonlinear problem ages ago and decided
it was OK?
