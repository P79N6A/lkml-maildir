I think that's going a little far.  What do you gain from having thread
groups recognized by the kernel?  You're obviously thinking of the Java
model, but Java uses them as an organizational tool that can be just as
easily (and cleanly) implemented in user space.  Fact is, different
processes ("process clusters") will own threads (processes) that are
related in a lot of different ways to each other, NONE of which matter to
the kernel.  Not even hierarchy makes much sense when threads (processes)
are that closely related - but we can ignore it.  But introducing yet
another arbitrary organization like thread groups - that's messy to
implement in the kernel and does no one any good by being there - is
working backwards.
