If this variable is not frequently used, why then define its own cache ?
Ie why not use kmalloc() and let kernel use a general cache ?
On a 32 CPUS machine, a kmem_create() costs a *lot* of ram.
This overhead is acceptable if and only if :
- A lot of objects can be allocated in some cases (and using a special cache 
can save ram because of power of two general caches alignement)
- A lot of objects are created/deleted per unit of time (performance is critical)
For example pipe() could use its own cache to speedup some benchmarks, but the 
general kmalloc()/kfree() was chosen instead.
