Irrelevant to this problem.  cpio unpack code is smaller, and its format 
allows easy and painless concatenation.

Correct -- and after the initramfs merge, initrd behavior will be 
completely unchanged.

Nothing is being purged.  Things are being moved to userspace, making 
the kernel smaller and less bloated.  The kernel's behavior to the end 
user is 100% unchanged.

initramfs decreases the kernel size by a load, thank you very much.
Further, any initrd solution is bloated -- you are using a ram disk and 
disk-based filesystem, the sum of which equates to ramfs -- with 
additional wasted memory for filesystem and ramdisk overhead.
