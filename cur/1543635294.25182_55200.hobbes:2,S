Well code decides. And in reality I have tried the much simpler goal
to unify the ide-floppy ide-tape and ide-cd parts which
should be common. Like for example a simple SCSI multi media command set
preparation library. Admittedly I have failed. Therefore and in
fact of the 2.6 release schedule it's simple not practical to
persue this road further. It makes much more sense to just
1. Scrap the specific atapi drivers.
2. Try to make ide-scsi independant from SCSI subsystem from users view.
3. Replicate some of the workarounds in the previous ide-xxxx drivers.

That's a deal.
