Okay. I've been meaning to update it.

One more problem is that you're also trying to follow a moving target
:>. In response to Pavel's last request, I'm preparing to work toward
using a linked list for the meta information (to allow unlimited image
size), and at the request of others, compressing (zlib) the saved pages
to make the image faster to save/load.
As to the layout and documentation, I hate them too. I had to keep
things as similar as possible to existing code to make merging easier,
but now that I'm merged with the 2.4 code, perhaps I can do some
cleanups.
Regards,
Nigel
