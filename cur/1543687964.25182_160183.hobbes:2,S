Hi Jamie,
I tried your test on my machine.  It fails with a segmentation
fault.  I noticed that the Pentium II specifications update manual
starts with rev C0 stepping (ignoring mask rev < 3).
I'm inclined to forgive Intel for not publishing the scary errata that
goes with the first few mask revs, particularly for an old product.
When I was chasing the original problem, I added tracing code 
(compiling the kernel with finstrument-functions) so that when I
got into kgdb after the double-fault I could see that it had just
completed a umask system call.  I'm assuming that it failed on
the sysexit.
I keep the old Pentium Pro around because it has an NMI interrupt
button.
I'm happy that Linus has merged the fix to disable correctly
disable sysenter for these machines.
