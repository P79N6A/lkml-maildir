	I agree with Krzysztof that sync board driver should be as simple
as possible, and syncppp.c (or whatever it will be named) should do
everything else (registering net device, switching link protocols, etc).
	Then we probably should move from library approach (as in current
syncppp.c) to a mid-layer approach (register_hdlc_dev(), struct
hdlc_device_ops).
	I can even imagine that syncppp.c (or its descendant) can do
a character device routines for the sync board (/dev/hdlcX).
: The "we ought to use pppd" case is quite valid. Its a 'when someone fixes it'
: task
	I haven't looked at the async PPP code yet. What parts of the PPP
is done by the kernel and what by the pppd?
