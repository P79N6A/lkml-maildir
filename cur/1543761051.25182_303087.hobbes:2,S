Because "classical" boleans are ints.
Because I don't know the relative speed of accessing single byte variables.
Because it was easy.
Because we only allocate 32 of these structures.  Changing them really
only adds four bytes per structure.  I guess using bytes and rearranging
the structure could actually save 4 bytes per structure.
I originally changed them to unsigned int single bit bitfields, but
changed my mind - would that be better?
It really makes little difference, I was just trying to get rid of the
silly signed single bit bitfields ...
