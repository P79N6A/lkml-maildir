7503bfbae89eba07b46441a5d1594647f6b8ab7d is first bad commit
commit 7503bfbae89eba07b46441a5d1594647f6b8ab7d

cpumask: use work_on_cpu in acpi-cpufreq.c for drv_read and drv_write
Impact: use new cpumask API to reduce stack usage
Replace the saving of current->cpus_allowed and set_cpus_allowed_ptr()
with a work_on_cpu function for drv_read() and drv_write().
Basically converts do_drv_{read,write} into "work_on_cpu" functions that
are now called by drv_read and drv_write.

theres something wrong here. Please tell me which information you need
to fix the problem, I will help as I can.
