Ok, thanks. I will restructure code and reorganize patches accordingly 
and post
updated patches.
To answer Ingo's question, we did look at other flags when I started. 
However,
I wanted to keep the system call simple enough, with atleast namespace 
unsharing,
so it would get accepted. In the original discussion on fsdevel, 
unsharing of vm
was mentioned as useful so I added that in addition to namespace unsharing.

I did have signal handler unsharing in one of the earlier incarnation of 
the patch,
however Chris Wright alerted me (on IRC) to a possible problem with posix
real time signals if we allow unsharing of signal handlers. He pointed 
me to the
way send_sigqueue is stashing sighand lock for later use and since 
timers are
flushed on exec and exit, it may lead to an oops. Since my primary 
interest was
in namespace unsharing, I disallowed unsharing of signal handler. I will 
take a
look at it more detail and come back with specific issues with sighand
unsharing.
Thanks.
