Thanks, Dinakar.
Linus - do *NOT* actually apply the literal patch that Dinakar ack'd.
 1) It's logic is backwards - arrgh.
 2) It doesn't undo the other attempt to partially disable this.
 3) It's not a formally submitted and signed off patch from me, but
    just a (useful) topic of discussion.
I have a pair of patches running through crosstool on several arch's now.
    The first patch undoes the partial disable of the cpuset to sched
    domain connection that is in 2.6.13-rc7 now.
    The second patch does what Nick and Dinakar now agree is right -
    totally disabling the ability for exclusive cpusets to define
    sched domains in 2.6.13.
