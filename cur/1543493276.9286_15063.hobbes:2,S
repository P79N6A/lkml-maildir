Hi all. Perhaps this is a little OT, but it looks like the
ibcs mailing list is not working (?)
We have  a problem with a COFF executable, with a kernel
2.0.36. The problem is that the software is able to run if
started from a directory with inode number less than 65536,
otherwise it fails with an error. According to what I've
seen, the problem should have been solved in the latest ibcs
for kernel 2.0 (ibcs-2.0-981105), but it doesn't look so.
Any suggestion would be apprectiated. If possible, please
reply directly to me.
TYIA.
