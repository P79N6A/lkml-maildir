What it does is check if the rodata marking was succesful. That's more than just checking 
change_page_attr() itself, and basically a reasonably self self-check of mark_rodata_const().

where we move the actual test function... I don't really care. Once pageattr-test.c
is merged I have absolutely no problem moving it there if it's the right place...
(one can argue that it should be in or near the mark_rodata_const() function instead
since it tests that one).
Just like the NX test I wrote yesterday (and will post later today) probably wants to live
somewhere close to the NX code.

Please spare me the bitter, undeserved sarcasm; I don't remember doing anything
to you to deserve that.
