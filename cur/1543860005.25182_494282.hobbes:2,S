I did measurements while in -mm, and yes it helped. And yes,
it works in 2.6.20-rc2, too:
root@amd:~# cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state ; sleep 20; cat
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state ; sleep 20; cat
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state ; sleep 20
present:                 yes
capacity state:          ok
charging state:          discharging
present rate:            14245 mW
remaining capacity:      50020 mWh
present voltage:         15793 mV
(turned off bluetooth hanging off USB here).
present:                 yes
capacity state:          ok
charging state:          discharging
present rate:            11650 mW
remaining capacity:      49940 mWh
present voltage:         15830 mV
present:                 yes
capacity state:          ok
charging state:          discharging
present rate:            10935 mW
remaining capacity:      49870 mWh
present voltage:         15826 mV
root@amd:~#
As you can see, it saves ~3.5W, which is huge deal on machine that
eats 11W total.
(X60 owners, get 2.6.20, and _disable that bluetooth_ while not in use).
