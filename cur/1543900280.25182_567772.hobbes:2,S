Subject: Strange OOM problem (swap empty)

Last night one of our testbed fileservers went OOM for unknown
reasons.  (The log is attached.)  Its a moderately complex setup - 2
dual-core Opteron chips with 8G of (matched) ram under Xen.  The file
array (which was doing heavy writes from this node using rsync) is an
external multi-connected scsi using clvmd and ocfs2.  (The other node
had no problems, but it was not doing anything other than idling with
2 xen guests, also idle.)
Local filesystems and swap are on an internal scsi raid rather than
the shared device.
The confusing part is that the dump shows swap almost completely
unused. So shouldn't memory pressure have forced something out to
swap?
I can provide any other info that would be helpful (and I'm subscribed
to the list).
