A simple "strace -f" should show whether the setscheduler() call
succeeds or not. Does 'jackstart' do anything with glibc internals?

there was a SCHED_FIFO bug in all 2.6 kernels prior 2.6.5, causing
erratic scheduling. Have you tried 2.6.6 or 2.6.7?

there's nothing special about NPTL, scheduling-wise. But if SCHED_FIFO
is not properly set for all JACK threads that could explain the
symptoms. You talked about kludges that are necessary to make all
threads SCHED_FIFO - are you 100% sure that all JACK threads are indeed
SCHED_FIFO after these kludges are applied? If yes and you are running a
later kernel then it's something new and probably NPTL-unrelated.
