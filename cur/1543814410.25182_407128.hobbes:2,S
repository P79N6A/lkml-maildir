remving joystick interface fixed it, but a nice warning still remains:
In file included from drivers/input/serio/libps2.c:19:
include/linux/input.h:957: warning: ‘struct input_device_id’ declared
inside parameter list

declaration, which is probably not what you want
this should be the cause of the problem.
