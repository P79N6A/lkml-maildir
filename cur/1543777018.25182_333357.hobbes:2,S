Greetings all,
First, im using 2.6.12 with version 3.1 of module-install-utils and GCC 4.0.1.
I simply cannot get kernel modules to install.
Building the kernel and modules works perfecty, no errors.
But on running "make modules_install" i get:
depmod: QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
  INSTALL drivers/net/wireless/atmel.ko
if [ -r System.map -a -x /sbin/depmod ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map
2.6.12; fi
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.6.12/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/atmel.ko
depmod:         __netdev_watchdog_up
depmod:         preempt_schedule
depmod:         _mmx_memcpy
depmod:         eth_type_trans
depmod:         param_get_charp
depmod:         __kfree_skb
depmod:         alloc_skb
........ and many more
Ive had this problem since i started using 2.6.x, and have always compiled
drivers into the kernel to avoid it. But now i do need to get this fixed so i
can get ndiswrapper working.
Does anyone know what could be wrong?
Thanks.
