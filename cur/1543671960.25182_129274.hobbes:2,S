Hmm.  SCO Group Chief Executive Darl McBride says _exactly_ the opposite
according to 
http://msnbc-cnet.com.com/2100-1016_3-999371.html
 :
    "We're finding ... cases where there is line-by-line code in the Linux kernel
    that is matching up to our UnixWare code.
    We're finding code that looks likes it's been obfuscated to make it look
    like it wasn't UnixWare code -- but it was."
Chris Sontag should get his story straight with his boss before he opens his
mouth to the press.
