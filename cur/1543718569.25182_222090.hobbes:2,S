Agreed.

You're absolutely right.

You are. In #4, the divider is arbitrarily chosen by "us", regardless of
the user's setup. In #2, the divider is chosen according to the user's
hardware and fan use. The common point is that (after setting the low
limit for #2) the divider will no longer change (until the low limit
changes for #2). But in #2 the divider is optimal, in #4 it is
arbitrary.
This makes a big difference because we cannot possibly arbitrarily pick
a divider and not allow the user to change it, so in #4 we would have to
keep the manual interface as well, as it exists for now. For #2, we can
reasonably hope to get rid of the manual interface after some times
(once the automatic mode will have been tested and is believed to be
correct).

Yes, that's a possibility. Not sure it's even worth the extra code, but
someone motivated could do it, you're right.
Thanks for your comments :)
