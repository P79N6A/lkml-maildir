I think we've noticed the past few years of foaming looney attacks from SCO, 
yes.  And Microsoft's own attempts to license its header files, and such.

Are you creating your source code based on somebody else's source code, or are 
you creating your source code based on something else (documentation, a 
defined API, etc).
Whether or not you include the header files is a relatively minor issue, 
really.

Been there, done that, watched it spawn groklaw.

Ask Microsoft.  They were flirting with this kind of thing years ago.  (Trying 
to make it so that their development tools couldn't be used to create open 
source.)  This effort was about as widely ignored as their shrinkwrap license 
terms from the 1980's.

Are those symbols documented?  Or did they have to deeply study a copyrighted 
work in that claims rights over derived works in order to find out about 
those symbols in the first place?

There's a difference between grounds for a lawsuit and a slam-dunk easy case 
you're confident you can win in a finite amount of time.  If you're trying to 
prevent Foaming Nutballs, Inc. from ever having the slightest trumped up 
grounds for a suit, you're not going to be doing much.

I don't think anybody with a brain is arguing that #including the userspace 
(/usr/include) header files puts your Linux program under the GPL.  And 
there's never been any alternative but to include the GPL linux kernel header 
files in those...

I've been considering the flip side of all these arguments for about five 
years, and considering them especially closely for the last two. :)
