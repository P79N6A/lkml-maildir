I thought the debate was over how the initial arming of the one-shot
was done.  
The choice above is a different issue.
Neither of 1 or 2 above accurately reflects what the code in the
kernel actually does.
Hitting EAGAIN does not "re-arm" the one-shot notification.  
Consider TCP.
The tcp write code issues a POLLOUT edge when the socket-buffer fill
level drops below a hi-water mark (tcp_min_write_space()). 
For reads, AFAIK, tcp issues POLLIN for every new TCP segment that
arrives, which get coalesced automatically by virtue of the getevents
barrier.
A short count means the appliation has hit an extreme end of the
buffer (completely full or empty).  EAGAIN means the buffer was
already at the extreme.  Either way you know just as well that new
activity will trigger a new edge event.
In summary, a short count is every bit as reliable as EAGAIN to know
that it is safe to wait on epoll_getevents.
Davide?

It's a minor point, but based on the logic above, I think this advise
is overkill.
