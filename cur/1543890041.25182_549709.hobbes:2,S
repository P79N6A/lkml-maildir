That's something that in theory may allow you to resume the system from
and initrd script.
Basically, you write your resume device's major and minor numbers
into it as the "MAJ:MIN" string (eg. "8:3" for /dev/sda3 on my box) and the
kernel will try to read the image from this device and restore it.
It only works with partitions and the use of it us discouraged, so it's
deliberately undocumented.
Greetings,
Rafael
