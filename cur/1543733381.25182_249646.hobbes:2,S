You probably need to decrease /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio and
dirty_background_ratio by a lot.  That will reduce the amount of
unreclaimable pagecache and will take pressure off page reclaim.
Also, converting the application to explicitly tell the kernel that it
doesn't want certain data cached will help things a lot. 
posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED), preferably preceded by fsync().

As I say above: avoiding putting all that pressure onto page reclaim in the
first case would be preferable to trying to fix stuff up after it has
happened.

General brain-fry, I expect.  There's a lot happening.
