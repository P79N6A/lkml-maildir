i just recognised this thread, and i found a solution for some weird stuff
also reported days ago on alsa-users list.
short summary for your information:
asus m2n32 ws professional 
amd x2 5000+
everything compiled as 64 bit.
i recognised strange behaviour from 2.6.19-rc1 on.
sound got crappy and if i tried to use snd_hda_intel as modules
rmmod & afterwards modprobe froze the machine completely.
even the kernel sys req key combination didn't work anymore.
after some small discussions on alsa-user ml i recognised this
thread today. 
i thought my problem could also exist on this msi stuff.
i disabled msi in kernel config, reboot, and, after starting x & kde
i got immediately a freeze.
last and maybe important last try has been to
enable msi support _but_ boot kernel with cmdline pci=nomsi
this finally did work out. i got a working sound environment again.
if i should supply more information on that, please contact me.
i find it a bit abnormal that the disabling msi in kernel config behaviour
is different from kernel cmdline pci=nomsi option.
best regards
marcel
ps. i don't want to break this thread up into something different, but maybe my 
     report works out as usefull.
