Filesystem clean = the "dirty" flag is not set. With journaling
fs it basically means the kernel didn't found errors during
operation.
It doesn't mean there are no errors.

I'd check with memtest86. Silent fs corruption is usually caused
by faulty hardware such as RAM.

I wouldn't count on it.

A system crash or especially power failure shouldn't damage ext3fs.
