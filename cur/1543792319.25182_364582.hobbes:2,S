My tool chain is an unmodified RedHat 9 default install with all updates 
applied.
Can we at least consider using -include instead of -imacros? I don't 
think breaking the compile on this tool chain is a good idea, even if it 
is old.
I have to revert the recent addition of -imacros to the Makefile to get my
tool chain to build.  Without the change, below, I get:
Note that this looks entirely like a toolchain bug.  Here is the offending command:
[pid 12163] execve("/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.2/tradcpp0", ["/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.2/tradcpp0", "-lang-asm", "-nostdinc", "-Iinclude", "-Iinclude/asm-i386/mach-default", "-D__GNUC__=3", "-D__GNUC_MINOR__=2", "-D__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__=2", "-D__GXX_ABI_VERSION=102", "-D__ELF__", "-Dunix", "-D__gnu_linux__", "-Dlinux", "-D__ELF__", "-D__unix__", "-D__gnu_linux__", "-D__linux__", "-D__unix", "-D__linux", "-Asystem=posix", "-D__NO_INLINE__", "-D__STDC_HOSTED__=1", "-Acpu=i386", "-Amachine=i386", "-Di386", "-D__i386", "-D__i386__", "-D__tune_i386__", "-D__KERNEL__", "-D__ASSEMBLY__", "-isystem", "/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.2/include", "-imacros", "include/linux/autoconf.h", "-MD", "arch/i386/kernel/.entry.o.d", "arch/i386/kernel/entry.S", "-o", "/tmp/ccOlsFJR.s"]
Which should execute properly, I think.  But it does not:
zach-dev:linux-2.6.14-zach-work $ make
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CHK     usr/initramfs_list
  AS      arch/i386/kernel/entry.o
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.2/tradcpp0: output filename specified twice
make[1]: *** [arch/i386/kernel/entry.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
gcc (GCC) 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5)
Deprecating the -imacros fixes the build for me.  It does not appear to be a
simple argument overflow problem in trapcpp0, since deprecating all the defines
reproduces the problem as well.  Also, switching -imacros to -include fixes the
problem.
