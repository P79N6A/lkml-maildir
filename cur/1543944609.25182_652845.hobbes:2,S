Subject: [PATCH] pcmcia: ipwireless depends on NETDEVICES.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

ipwireless (added by 099dc4fb62653f6019d78db55fba7a18ef02d65b) is clearly
a net device:
drivers/built-in.o: In function `ipwireless_ppp_start_xmit':
/home/pmundt/devel/git/sh-2.6.25/drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless/network.c:165: undefined reference to `skb_under_panic'
/home/pmundt/devel/git/sh-2.6.25/drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless/network.c:165: undefined reference to `kfree_skb'
drivers/built-in.o: In function `ipwireless_network_packet_received':
/home/pmundt/devel/git/sh-2.6.25/drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless/network.c:377: undefined reference to `__alloc_skb'
/home/pmundt/devel/git/sh-2.6.25/drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless/network.c:377: undefined reference to `skb_over_panic'
drivers/built-in.o: In function `ppp_shutdown_interface':
/home/pmundt/devel/git/sh-2.6.25/drivers/net/ppp_generic.c:2517: undefined reference to `unregister_netdev'
/home/pmundt/devel/git/sh-2.6.25/drivers/net/ppp_generic.c:2517: undefined reference to `free_netdev'
[ ... and many more ... ]
select strikes again. ipwireless selects PPP which in turn tries to select
SLHC, both of which are technically "protected" by an if NETDEVICES
in drivers/net/Kconfig. This leads to .config hilarity, with net suddenly
ending up in the SCSI menu:
	#
	# SCSI device support
	#
	# CONFIG_SCSI_DMA is not set
	# CONFIG_SCSI_NETLINK is not set
	CONFIG_PPP=y
	# CONFIG_PHONE is not set
Curiously the SLHC select from PPP doesn't seem to happen, as there's no
CONFIG_SLHC=y (only CONFIG_PPP=y gets set) -- Kconfig bug? Caught with a
randconfig.
