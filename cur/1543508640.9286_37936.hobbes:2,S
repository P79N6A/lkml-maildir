When you follow the rules, the tools work. When you break the rules, the
tools break. glibc developers are not gods and they do not have the power to
change the fact that 8 characters is the rule. Increasing the size of some
username buffers inside glibc is meaningless at best. At worst, it encourages
people to create usernames that will break dozens of standard tools.
