I was referring to sysfs_remove_file(), not sysfs_open_file() -- I agree 
that getting rid of the check_perm() routine is good.  But this isn't:

There's no apparent advantage to introducing the local variable d, either 
in terms of execution speed or readability.  (Although the original source 
line should have a space after the comma.)
