Subject: mixing 32 and 64 bit?

I just wonder how some userland applications are able to use 64-bit 
capabilities although they are started by an  ELF 32-bit binary. I observed
this when installing vmware: Even if the binary is an ELF32, it is
able to provide an 64Bit ABI to its guest OS. Until now I thought a
process is either 32bit or 64bit. Seems this is not true. 
Has some one a good link or entry point about this topic?
I could not find a matching keyword to search for. 
Regards, Dieter.
