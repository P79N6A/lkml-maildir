As is shown every now and then, when the next security hole is
reported. So we stay at the lowest common denominator.
I've always had good experience with educating people, not with
dumbing them down. But maybe I've been just lucky then and worked
with very smart people.

So we throw out the baby with the bath water. This is conservatism at
it's worst.

Stating the obvious. Capabilities are not an end in itself, nor is suid
root. It's just another line of defense to help with these binaries,
which are _not_ capability aware.
