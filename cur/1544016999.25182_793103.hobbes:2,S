One of the things I'd like to see happen with this work is for
us to have a cheap per-cpu atomic counter that we can use for
SNMP stats.
If we can make the inc/add variants into a single instruction,
then it won't need to disable preemption or interrupts.
So if you could design the API such that we have a variant of
add/inc that automatically disables/enables preemption then we
can optimise that away on x86.
Thanks,
