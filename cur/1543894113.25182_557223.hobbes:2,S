Perhaps you mis-understood me:  the class level device suspend/resume
hooks don't rely on class_device.  I observe that /sys/class/input
still exists (2.6.22-rc4-git), so if all you mean is that it's no
longer using class_device, that's good.  One part of the reason to
stop using class_device is specifically to let framework code (like
input, network, or rtc) receive class level suspend/resume calls.
ISTR the RTC framework was the first to do that, but there's some
work afoot to teach the network stack to use that mechanism too.
Or are you referring to some input patches which I've not yet seen,
which cause /sys/class/input to vanish?
