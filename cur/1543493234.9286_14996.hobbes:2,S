The way I remember this was that folks set this to match however much
memory they had installed, and that was causing problems.  Limiting it
to full GB ranges should eliminate this problem.
I also seem to recall that the memory divide had to be an integral
power of two, so the only useful values were 1GB and 2GB.  Am I
misremembering here?
