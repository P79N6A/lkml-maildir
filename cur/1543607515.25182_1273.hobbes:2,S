That is right.  Not during the move.
Well... the tid of the directory itself changes during the move.  The
tid's of descendants change later.

Have a look at the code and see where treequota_check is called.
It is called every time a "lookup" is done, whether the result is in
the cache or not.  If the lookup found something, then you have a
inode and it's parent right there in the cache.  treequota_check
checks that the tid of the child matches that of the parent, and
changes it if not.  So the overhead is very small for the common case
where the tid is correct.
It just tests:
   is inode NULL
   are treequotas enabled for this inode
   does the tid of the child match that of the parent (or the uid of
           the child if parent.tid==0

I accept that it does look like a bit of a hack.
But I think it is simple, understandable, and predictable.
And I think that (for me) the value of tree quotas is more than enough
to offset that cost.
