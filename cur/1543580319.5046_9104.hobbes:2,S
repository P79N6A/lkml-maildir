Are you sure you get the same results with 2.4.1? I'm in the exact
same position (G200 on a Gigabyte GA5AX with ALi M1541/3). There was a
patch to properly support AGP on these boards which went in between
2.4.0 and 2.4.1 which solved the problem for me (at least in 2.4.0; I
haven't tested DRI throughly in 2.4.1 yet).
