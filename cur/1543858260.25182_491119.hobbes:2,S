Hi,
thats really cool stuff you're providing with your patches. :)
I have some feedback or questions some parts here.
But as i just started trying to get into kernelhacking you probably
better don't take my notes to serious, please.

What is zap here for? future use?
And wouldn't it be good to also initialize mplayload here?

Is there a special reason why you already assign the errors to the
return value variable before its clear that the assignment is needed?

Isn't the last "|| !data" redundant as you already tested if datalen ==0?

Same as above: Why do you in any case want to assign it here?
> +        mpayload = kmalloc(sizeof(*mpayload) + datalen, GFP_KERNEL);
I may be totally wrong, but is dereferencing a not initialized pointer
(even just for using sizeof) really ok? Wouldn't it be safer to use
a sizeof(struct mmc_key_payload) here?
Thanks,
Frank
