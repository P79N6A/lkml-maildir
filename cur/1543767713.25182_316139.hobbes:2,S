If I understand Andre correctly, his patch will prevent infinite recursion
in the oops path - if some process oopses after having run exit_mm().
If so then it's a reasonable debugging aid.  Although there might be better
places to do it, such as
	if (!current->i_tried_to_exit++)
		return;
in do_exit().   Dunno.
