Ah, I see what I was missing.  So long as the tlb flush is in between the
ptep_test_and_clear_dirty and the set_page_dirty, we're fine (ie the
current code is good).  If we really want to reduce the number of tlb
flushes, yes, we can use the gather code and then just do the
set_page_dirty after a tlb_flush_range.
