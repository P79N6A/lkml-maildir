If you can associate files with containers, you can have a "shared
libraries" container that the libraries/binaries for apache/php/glibc
are associated with - all pages from those files are then accounted to
the shared container. So you can see that there are 5000 apaches each
using say 10MB privately, and sharing a container with 100MB of file
data. This can also be O(1) in the number of apache containers.
