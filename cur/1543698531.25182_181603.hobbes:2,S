It seems possible that these commands (above) are flushing the kernel
log buffer to disk (/var/log/messages e.g.), so that they don't need
to be saved by kmsgdump.  Have you looked in the kernel message file
for them?

The kmsgdump patch adds Alt-SysRq-D to force entry into kmsgdump
instead of getting there via a panic.
