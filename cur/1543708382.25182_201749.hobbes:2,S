The kernel headers are to be used for compiling the kernel only!
Older distributions may have a sim-link (two) for /usr/include/linux
and /usr/include/asm. These should point to the headers used to
compile the 'C' runtime library, not the current kernel headers.
A fix is to remove these symlinks and create directories that contain
your last working headers.
Cheers,
