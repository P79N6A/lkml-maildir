-mm is available only as a patchset, not via git.
There has been a git version of it, but it's not currently working and
hasn't been for 2 months or so.
I mostly use the grab_kernel script that I mentioned.  It knows how
to download linux-2.6.M and how to apply -rcN, -gitN, and/or -mmN
patches to the base (linux-2.6.M).
E.g.:
grab_kernel 2.6.23-rc3-git6 $PWD
or
grab_kernel 2.6.23-rc3-mm1 $PWD
