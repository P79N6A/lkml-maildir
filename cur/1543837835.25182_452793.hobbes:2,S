I would do it this way (untested):
ENTRY(kernel_thread_helper)
	CFI_STARTPROC
	movl %edx,%eax
	pushl %edx
	CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET 4
	call *%ebx
	pushl %eax
	CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET 4
	call do_exit
	CFI_ENDPROC
ENDPROC(kernel_thread_helper)
(i.e. tracking the stack pointer movement, but not the register values
other than the return address)
