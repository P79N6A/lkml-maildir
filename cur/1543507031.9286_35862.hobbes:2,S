It sounds good but conceptually I don't like it.  Making a page uncached 
involves messing with the pagetables and perhaps creating a completely new 
mapping.  This isn't something that __get_free_pages should be doing in my 
opinion.  I would prefer people to allocate pages using 
__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL) and then create an uncached mapping using some 
other function, or perhaps do both in one go using a vmalloc variant.
