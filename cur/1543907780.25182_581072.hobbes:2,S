Heh, no it's very subtle. We do the "push %rsp" after the "push %2". So on
return from the call, the stack that was pushed, is really 8 bytes off.
Because we didn't save the stack pointer from the entry of the asm, we
saved it after doing that "push %2". :-)
We get back to this call via a retq from the HV switcher code. So that rsp
that was pushed will be the stack.

I did a swapgs here, so we have the HV GS value. I don't know of an easy
way to read the GS value to put it into the RSP.

Well, it is quite complex, since we can't save anything in the writable
section that the guest can't also write to. Remember, we are in ring 1 for
the guest kernel, so we have no protection. All the host related stuff is
in read only sections when we are using the guest cr3.
What I would like to do is have the GS point to the read only section, and
load the RSP from a value there. But first we need to store the old value
of RSP.  The problem is, where do you store it. Hmm, I guess I can create
my own "big" offset from the read only section :)
OK this gives me an idea, I *can* point the kernel GS to the vcpu read
only section, and have a way to store the value with the GS offset. The
read only section is always mapped before the read write section, so it
should be easy to calculate the diff!
Thanks for the comment, you guided me to this great idea!
