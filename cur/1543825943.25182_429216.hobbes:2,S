Wrong.. USB devices are not allowed to draw more than some amount (100 
mA I think) of power before the host tells it that it is allowed to 
switch into full-power mode. Any device that doesn't do this doesn't 
comply with the USB specs. Therefore it is very possible to connect a 
device and discover that it can't be enabled.
