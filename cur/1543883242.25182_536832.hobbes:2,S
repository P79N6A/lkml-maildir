Yes. I have retested it another time ( for adding the small usb debug 
message ) and get the same message a new time.
Maybe a tiny difference : only eth0 was setup during boot ( bond0 and eth1 was 
not setup - volontary  - to avoid problem that could interfere with usb ). 
Ony after having done my usb test, i have stopped the eth0, setup bond 
interface and restart bond interface and got the same problem with the same 
back trace.
Is there anything i can do to get you more precise information ?
Resend to the list : i have stripped lklm from the recipients......
