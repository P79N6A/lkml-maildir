Ahh.
Ok, that's a totally different issue, and is one where I heartily agree 
with you. I would actually *love* for the GPL (any version) to have a 
"guarantee of authenticity", where if you distribute a binary, there has 
to be some documented way to get *exactly* that binary out of the source 
code that got distributed.
Of course, SHA1's can be used to verify that, although, quite frankly, I'd 
expect that a simple "cmp" would be the more straightforward approach.
So the "verification" can be used both to lock down a particular binary 
_and_ to authenticate that the binary really came from the source code it 
was claimed to come from.
Of course, in practice, it's actually really nasty to do that 
verification. Many compilers actually do things like insert date-stamps in 
the object files etc. So it's probably not all that practical.
