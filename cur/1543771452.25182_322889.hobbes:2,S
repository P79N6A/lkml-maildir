Subject: [GIT PATCH] More USB bugfixes for 2.6.12-rc5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/3/37

Here are some more USB patches for the 2.6.12-rc5 tree.  The ub patch is pretty
big, but I forgot to send that one to you way back at the beginning of 2.6.12-rc
It has had much testing in the -mm tree.  The other patches are just fixes or
device ids, or a new driver.  And the cp2101 driver has an update to actually
make it useful.  All of these patches have been in the past few -mm
releases.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
Full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
