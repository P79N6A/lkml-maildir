I have had a rather busy website have problems with processes getting
"stuck" in D state. 2.2.5 has been flawless. These are SMP P-II 450Mhz
w/symbios SCSI and Intel dual Pro 100+ cards.
5 systems now in production 1 was running 2.2.7. It ran just fine under
no/low load conditions for about three days before live traffic was
switched to it, problems occured within minutes after going live. I did
not have the luxury of having any time to troubleshoot the problem so I
backed out to 2.2.5 in a hurry and it has been running well ever since.
The 2.2.5 systems have been in production for just a little over a week
now. I am really eager to try 2.2.9 but my fingers still smart from 2.2.7.
The performance numbers I have seen in the kernel list look nice.
