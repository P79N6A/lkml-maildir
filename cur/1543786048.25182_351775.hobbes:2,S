This is hardware and driver specific.  Most of the time, the driver
will have access to the 802.11 header, however, it will reformat the
packet into a standard ethernet frame before passing it up to the
network layer.
So, no you cannot see the 802.11 header in a sk_buff because it is
already stripped off.  If you look in the driver before it hits the
network layer (in the rx routine) then you may be able to get access
to it there.
