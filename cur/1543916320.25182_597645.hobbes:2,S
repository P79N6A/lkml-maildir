Sorry for being late to reply, but do you still want such a patch (i.e.
convert static to dynamic allocation)?
I read elsewhere on this thread that you'd merge Kamalesh's patch and
fix it up to also use kobject_name() yourself. But it's a small/trivial
driver, so I think just converting it to dynamic allocation right now
itself (when we've noticed it already) is probably better (?)
[ BTW I don't see the fix in your git trees or quilt queue. So I'll
  make a patch on top of 2.6.23-rc6-mm1 itself. ]
Thanks,
Satyam
