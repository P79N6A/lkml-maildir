I'm not using setserial on this port, myself.  If something in init is 
calling on setserial then I don't know about it.
That said, tests on the serial port from within the application show 
that xmit_fifo_size is set to 16 as it should be.
I wrote up a little test app:
    struct serial_struct serial;
    ioctl(modemFd, TIOCGSERIAL, &serial);
    printf("            type: %d\n", serial.type);
    printf("            line: %d\n", serial.line);
    printf("            line: %u\n", serial.port);
    printf("             irq: %d\n", serial.irq);
    printf("           flags: %d\n", serial.flags);
    printf("  xmit_fifo_size: %d\n", serial.xmit_fifo_size);
    printf("  custom_divisor: %d\n", serial.custom_divisor);
    printf("       baud_base: %d\n", serial.baud_base);
    printf("     close_delay: %u\n", serial.close_delay);
    printf("         io_type: 0x%X\n", serial.io_type);
    printf("reserved_char[0]: 0x%X\n", serial.reserved_char[0]);
    printf("            hub6: %d\n", serial.hub6);
    printf("    closing_wait: %u\n", serial.closing_wait);
    printf("   closing_wait2: %u\n", serial.closing_wait2);
    printf(" iomem_reg_shift: %u\n", serial.iomem_reg_shift);
    printf("       port_high: %u\n", serial.port_high);
    printf("     reserved[0]: %d\n", serial.reserved[0]);
Here's the output:
            type: 4
            line: 1
            line: 760
             irq: 3
           flags: 1358954688
  xmit_fifo_size: 16
  custom_divisor: 0
       baud_base: 115200
     close_delay: 500
         io_type: 0x0
reserved_char[0]: 0x0
            hub6: 0
    closing_wait: 30000
   closing_wait2: 0
 iomem_reg_shift: 0
       port_high: 0
     reserved[0]: 0
Thanks,
Lee.
