I tried the slub-patches and the avoid atomic overhead patch against
2.6.21-mm1.  It brings the TCP_STREAM performance for SLUB to the SLAB
level.  The patches not mentioned in the "series" file did not apply
cleanly to 2.6.21-mm1 and I skipped most of those.  
Patches applied are: 
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/christoph/slub-
patches/series + dentry_target_reclaimed + kmem_cache_ops + slub_stats +
skip_atomic_overhead
Without skip atomic overhead patch, the throughput drops by 1 to 1.5%.
The change from slub_min_order=0 slub_max_order=4 
to slub_min_order=6 slub_max_order=7 did not make much difference in
my tests.
