- Please put [patch] in the Subject: line of patches

From: Chandru <chandru@in.ibm.com>
When booted with crashkernel=224M@32M or any memory size less than this,
the system boots properly.  The following was the observation..  The
system comes up with two nodes (0-256M and 256M-4GB).  _The crashkernel
memory reservation spans across these two nodes.  _The
mark_reserved_regions_for_nid() in arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c resizes the
reserved part of the memory within it as:
_ _ _ _ _ _ if (end_pfn > node_ar.end_pfn)
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ reserve_size = (node_ar.end_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT)
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - (start_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT);
but the reserve_bootmem_node() in mm/bootmem.c raises the pfn value of end 
_ _ end = PFN_UP(physaddr + size);
This causes end to get a value past the last page in the 0-256M node. 
_Again when reserve_bootmem_node() returns,
_mark_reserved_regions_for_nid() loops around to set the rest of the
crashkernel memory in the next node as reserved.  _ It references
NODE_DATA(node_ar.nid) and this causes another 'Oops: kernel access of bad
area' problem.  The following changes made the system to boot with any
amount of crashkernel memory size.
