To work correctly, this requires to kill the current psaux and keyboard
driver, and those two are one file, and are very very builtin into the
console system.
Thus it's a patch of almost thousand lines to pc_keyb.c and keyboard.c
and can't easily added as a CONFIG_ option.
Plus, it's very likely the new PS/2 code will break on some systems that
have not-so-compatible i8042 chips, so it is really something that can't
go in 2.4. And I would love to have it in 2.4, really.
