To make it so that:
- cdrecord keeps its dev=b,t,l command line interface
- a cdrecord wrapper program lets a user specify the os specific name
to access the drive. The wrapper program would identify the b,t,l name
and feed it correctly to cdrecord. This can also be used to correctly
identify 2 identical drives using their OS specific names.
-scanbus displays:
1,0,0: DRIVE MODEL XYZ
2,0,0: DRIVE MODEL XYZ
but thank to that proposal, one would also have:
1,0,0 <= /dev/hdc
2,0,0 <= /dev/hdd
I think it's a good compromise between what the users want and what you want.
So, WDYT?
