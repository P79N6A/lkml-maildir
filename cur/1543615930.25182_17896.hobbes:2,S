I speculate this would be good for small systems as well as it reduces
the size of struct page by 2*sizeof(unsigned long) bytes, allowing more
incremental allocation of pagecache metadata. I haven't tried it on my
smaller systems yet (due to lack of disk space and needing to build the
cross-toolchains), though I'm now curious as to its exact behavior there.
Has anyone tried to do accounting on the radix tree metadata overhead yet?
Cheers,
Bill
