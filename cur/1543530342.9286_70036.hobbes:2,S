Just because you can describe an example scenario in which COW and
overcommit are both used, does not mean that they are inseparable. You can do
COW by simply *reserving* RAM or swap space at fork() time and copying data
into it later. That is COW without overcommit.
Unfortunately nobody with the necessary skills seems interested in
implementing it that way.
