True.  Right now I'm just lazy and prefer to keep them under my
control.  Maybe if 2.7 was already opened.

Actually, I do.  I'm still not convinced that all the low-level
read/write functions need a struct file* as an argument, that looks
like a really ugly hack to help nfs and some others.  And if those can
go, the #include will go as well.  So the ugly line serves as a
reminder for a different problem. :)
On the other hand, if you can convince me that there is no way to
avoid passing the struct file*, then I agree and the #include will
move up.

Yes, makes sense.  I will keep the BUG_ON for a while as a reminder to
really think through all the consequences, but most likely, I will
just follow your suggestion.
A real problem is that copyfile() has all errno's from create(),
sendfile() and unlink() combined, which doesn't make error handling in
userspace easy.  "It could be this, that or another error" is the kind
of mess I always hated about Windows, so I should try to do a little
better.
