I'm not know about Dell PowerEdge 1300 but I have Dell PowerEdge 2300 with
similar configuration and you MUST use SMP kernel there (even when there
are in fact just one processor unit installed). Reason ? APIC ... All external
PCI devices on Dell PowerEdge 2300 (I almost sure for PowerEdge 1300 this is
true as well) are using APIC-extended interrupts (Linux marks them as IRQ 20,
IRQ 21, etc). So with UP kernel you simple will be unable to use your hardware.

Sometimes it's troublesome (in VERY rare situations: on some rare Cyrix and/or
AMD processors mostly), but usually it's just Ok. Slightly slower then UP
kernel, though. With PowerEdge you have no choices anyway.

Check your /proc/interrupts file. If there are APIC interrupts > 15IRQ (last
"normal" interrupt) listed as used for something then you have the same
situation as I am and SHOULD use SMP kernel.
