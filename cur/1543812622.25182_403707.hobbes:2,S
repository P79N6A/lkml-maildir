Testing that kernel now, with good news: the machine has been apparently
stable, running Gaussian processes for the last 20 hours, with no
oom-killer messages.
A new "feature": 36 of these kernel message pairs as boot time:
  device-mapper: dm-linear: Device lookup failed
  device-mapper: error adding target to table
Many thanks and best regards
