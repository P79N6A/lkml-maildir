That was a dopey thing to do.  Both PAGE_SIZE and sizeof() are unsigned and
we went and cast it to a signed thing, even though it is a nonsense to ever
consider a negative value of this.

We now have a jumble of signed and unsigned, stuck together with min_t
sticky tape.
Please, take a closer look in there and see if there's anything which
*needs* to be signed: is there anything which can actually, sensibly have a
negative quantity?  I bet there isn't, and I bet the code would be cleaner,
faster and more obviously correct if it was converted to unsigned throughout.
I blame C.  Negative quantities are rare, and C's default of treating
scalars as signed was a mistake.  Oh well.
