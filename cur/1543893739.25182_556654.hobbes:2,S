There are 4 K8 Memory Controller registers, 2 of which are already in pci_ids.h (and are used by
others) and 2 more that I need. I define the 2 I need now in the file, but was worried when
someone else might add them to the pci_ids.h file.  Just figured that it would be better to keep
all 4 together.
So is the model of such placement to locate the #define near to the sole consumer of that item? 
And if used by others, to move it to the pci_ids.h file?
thanks
