Cudos to Stallman, The patent retaliation clause is exactly what has 
been missing.  The inclusion of custom binaries was a little vague, but
the net of it is that the end user can combine the separate parts, and 
have the freedom to do so given the GPL3 terms.  Any concensus on 
whether Linux will move to GPL3?   I support adoption and congrats to 
Stallman -- A++++.
