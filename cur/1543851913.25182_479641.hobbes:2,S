they do and it's more or less required there (for mount-by-label and
many other things).
But it's easy to do.
In fact, if you use "make install" as the last step in your build
process, the kernel build process will
1) copy the bzImage over to /boot for you
2) make an initrd for your system
3) add the kernel and initrd to grub for you
this is a very convenient step that makes it very robust to do, and
beats doing the manual thing even if you wouldn't do an initrd in terms
of convenience..
