   If you allocate bootmem and you want to have it freed, you have to call
free_bootmem(), but before the bootmem area gets "frozen" which is before
kmalloc gets initialized.

   For a (I hope fairly good) example of how to use bootmem in network
drivers, look at the recent ARCnet driver in drivers/net/arcnet/com90xx.c.
				Have a nice fortnight
