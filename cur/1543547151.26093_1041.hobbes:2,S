Basically your base driver will have to do it at boot up time. Once that
memory is allocated to someone you may not be able to move the memory and
borrow the pages.
You don't neccessarily need the whole driver in the main kernel but you will
need to grab the devices, reserve the memory pages in question and mark them
as reserved before Linux gets going properly. Your actual users of these pages
can then be dynamically loaded.
