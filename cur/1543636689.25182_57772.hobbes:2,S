More info, for it is useful. During a similar run of netpipe, at about 500Mb/s,
switch stats are like this:

Firmware versions:
   Boot PROM version: v2.00.04       
   Firmware version:  v2.00.14       
Ihave seen in Intel web that there is a new firmware numberd 2.00.17, that
corrects some issues. I will try it....
