You misunderstand my point.  I don't care whether it is a tar bug or not.
I'm not claiming it is a tar bug.  I'm saying that people on those threads
claimed that this is a tar bug and used that as an excuse to do nothing
about the problem of world-writeable files in the Linux tar archive.
I'm saying that's a lousy excuse.  What I'm saying is that, even if we
accept that it is a tar bug, that's not a good excuse for doing nothing
about the problem.  Of course, if it is not a tar bug, then that makes
it an even weaker excuse.
