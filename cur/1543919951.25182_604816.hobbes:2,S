No problem, this merging work is the perfect thing when I need a
break-- mindless enough to be relaxing, but useful enough that I don't

Anyway, I assume you meant to write "I [will] take yours", since I
don't see anything at all in tglx/linux-2.6-x86.git right now.  I'll
check again on Monday and base my work on your tree.
