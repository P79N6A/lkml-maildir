PowerPC is one of the main ones I've not touched because it needs work
itself to sort out the IBSHIFT value and bit allocations, also because
its one of several dependant upon the asm-generic stuff (which also means
your patch won't work)
Most people copied the x86 behaviour which makes it easy to transplant.
Some are just smoking something (see ioctls.h for sh-64 and weep), others
have slightly odd behaviour for historical compatibility reasons (Sparc)

It's not a bogus assumption. The current code supports
	- The old way
	- BOTHER and IBSHIFT
When PPC wants to do arbitary baud rate it needs to resolve both of the
definitions together. IBSHIFT is simply the shift you apply to the baud
bits to get the input baud bits.
