You're just a little bit out of date. Trix4.0.5 (evaluated @ B1 in 1995)
did it that way. On the other hand, Trix4.0.5 had a superuser, too.

Right unpleasant it was, too.
On the other hand, it turns out that in most real cases where the
strong seperation of Mandatory Access Control is used, only the
lowly, underpaid, long suffering sysadmins ever need windows at
multiple levels.

The back of the official Trix T-shirt of the time had two dinosaurs,
one purple and friendly, the other with blood dripping from it's claws.
The first was labeled "Irix", the second, "T. Irix".

This is a demostratably false assertion. I certainly agree that
a Multilevel secure server is easier to use. However, Trix4.0.5
was evaluated at B1 with a vanilla X server, GL support, a Superuser,
no ACLs, and a network.

Yup, that's their unsubstantiated claim. Now, SecureWare and DEC
both evaluated systems supporting Multilevel X servers. Trix 6.5,
the current version, supports Multilevel X. We may choose not to
evaluate it for schedule reasons, but we'd like to.
