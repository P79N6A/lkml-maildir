I am the server admin for several very busy IRC servers with an ever
increasing user load but I've hit a severe bottle neck which after numerous
system tweaks and driver configuration changes I can only assume is related
to a performance problem with the Linux Kernel.
The server configurations are all identical:
    Compaq Proliant 330R's with Dual Pentium III -800 MHz's & 384MB RAM
    Intel NIC's using the Intel e100 driver
    2.4.17 kernel
    2 ircd processes per box
Here is a snapshot from 'top' :
      9:51pm  up 11 days, 10:13,  1 user,  load average: 0.95, 1.24, 1.21
    44 processes: 40 sleeping, 4 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
    CPU0 states: 27.2% user, 62.4% system,  0.0% nice,  9.2% idle
    CPU1 states: 28.4% user, 62.3% system,  0.0% nice,  8.1% idle
    Mem:   385096K av,  376896K used,    8200K free,       0K shrd,    3588K
buff
    Swap:  379416K av,   12744K used,  366672K free                   58980K
cached
      PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
     7825 ircd      18   0 84504  82M  5604 R    89.5 21.9  6929m ircd
    31010 ircd      20   0 86352  84M  5676 R    85.0 22.3  7218m ircd
When this snapshot was taken each ircd had 2000 users connect each. As you
can see I am using more than a single cpu's worth of processer power just on
system cpu and the ircd processes are using just over 50% of a single cpu!
Now in comparison, another server admin who runs a ircd on a single P3-500
Linux 2.4.x system with 3000 users reaches about 60% *total* cpu usage.
Likewise admins who run *BSD or Solaris can run with similar user
connections and barely break a sweat. I have tried setting all the network
performance tweaks mentioned on numerous sites and also using the cpu saver
option on the e100 driver but at best I have only seen a 1-2% cpu saving.
Naturally I would really like to know where / what is using up all this
system cpu so I would like to try profiling the kernel as I'm sure this is a
pure kernel network layer performance issue but I have no idea where to
start so does anyone have some advice / tips on where I should start?
Vince.
