Rusty, I give you two reason why you should be using the gcc documented
"aligned" features :)
1) using "void *data[0];" and expecting an alignement, being undocumented,
	will force not obvious constraints for the gcc folks
2) I was looking at my latest copy of the ISO standard, section :
	6.7.5.2 "Array declarators" - Point 1)
	where it is explicitly declared that the constant expression that
	declared the size of the array must be greater then zero
Looking at how gcc folks is driving towards standards I will expect them
screaming at you in a near future :)
