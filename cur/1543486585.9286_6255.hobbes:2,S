I just finished installing 2.2.2pre5, and I am getting these errors upon a
depmod -ae:

Yes, I did make sure to copy over the new kernel/System.map/modules.
System is a dual PPro, SMP kernel, booting off a floppy with an nfs-root.
Kernel was compiled with:
make dep clean
make MAKE="make -j 4" bzImage modules
make modules_install
