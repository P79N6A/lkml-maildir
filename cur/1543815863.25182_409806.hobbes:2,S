classic vga video overlay, e.g., right?

maybe the reason for the green flashes in the picture i have with epox 8kha+ 
and asrock k7vt4a+ (both via 82xx).
its gone since i added a sil680 pci ide-controller for the disks and using 
the via ide only for dvdr/dvdrw drives now..

yes, indeed a good point. remember i blamed the v4l bt87x driver with xawtv for 
corrupting my root fs on kernel 2.4 some years ago, you can find the bug report on 
the v4l list, if i remember it right...

the question is *if* the hardware can handle this, as you said, so 
blacklisting hardware that cannot handle this error free should be ok,
sorry.
but if windos hadnt had support for this, i wouldnt have been able 
to use overlay video with the hauppauge wintv bt87x for years without 
any issue i can remember... right?
