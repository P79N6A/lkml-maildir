I completely agree that it shouldn't have been included that late in
the release cycle, in particular when it obviously received no testing
at all (it breaks all versions of lm-sensors.)
The reason why it was merged is that some people feared that
application authors would add support for the new thermal zone
interface (/sys/class/thermal) quickly instead of waiting for the same
information to be exported through the standard hwmon interface
(/sys/class/hwmon) which libsensors supports. This now appears to be a
very small problem compared to breaking lm-sensors for all users out
there.

This would be totally fine with me, yes.
