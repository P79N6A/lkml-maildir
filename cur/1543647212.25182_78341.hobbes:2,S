Well, yes I found out.. This anomaly with the assembler.....
.section .data
.global	pars
.type	pars,@object
.size	pars,4
.align  4
pars:	.long	0
.end
I accidentally left out .size, guess what? Even though I had an
offset recognized and a ".long", initialized to 0, there was no
space allocated and therefore the seg-fault. I would have seen
this, but the problem doesn't exist if the ".section" is ".bss",
the first section I was messing with. Go figure?
And the writable, is a COW. It isn't seen by others. It's a shame.
It would be very useful to have a writable global section available 
like VAXen did.
