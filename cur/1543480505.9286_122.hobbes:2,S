An soon as a process gives up the CPU (and reschedules)
it's in kernel mode. We can, however, use the arch-specific
TSS structure to see if the task is in kernel mode.
Since we only have to do that when rescheduling SCHED_IDLE
processes, the costs will actually be bearable for the kernel
and Linus can be convinced that it's worth the trouble...
