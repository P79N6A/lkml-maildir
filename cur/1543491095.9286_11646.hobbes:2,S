Being somewhat unfamiliar with the SCSI layer of Linux, I have a few
questions:
* I have a jaz cartridge with some bad sectors. When I try to use
badblocks[mke2fs|scsiformat] to [check|make a fs|format] the disk, it
gets stuck in DW state. At this point the process is unkillable, and the
drive is unuseable. System load gets stuck at >= 1. Is there any way to
prevent this from happening, as this causes many problems when rebooting
[fsck fsck fsck].
* Is it a good idea to have the Jaz on the same SCSI bus as the OS
disks?
* Can I safely remove/attatch the Jaz without powering down?
System is 2.2.4, PII-450, 128MB ram, all SCSI with dual Adaptec 2940UW
controllers.
