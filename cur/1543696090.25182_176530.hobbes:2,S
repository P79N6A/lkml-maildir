   I have similar problem with intel D865PERL motherboard. only it 
happens rarely. It seems that _sometime_ when I restart system the BIOS 
does not recognize SATA drives (it waits for a fairly long time), linux 
then does not recognize SATA drives either.
   it doesn't seem to be linux specific (IIRC it happened when rebooting 
win xp pro as well).
