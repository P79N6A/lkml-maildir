it's confusing not to have it there, i've fixed this. (patch attached) [in
that particular source context it makes no difference (this is why the
original asm had no volatile and it didnt show up), but yep you are right]

some of my old code in time.c was doing something like that, and you'll
notice that my patch changes it back. I found it to be a wrong assumption
to 'hand-schedule' IO (especially _p IO) with whatever other instructions,
the CPU will not do anything better. I thought there might be some
instruction overlap, but there isnt. I'm not sure what things you are
'doing in the middle', maybe you have a different goal. Having one
function to access the hw makes the code somewhat clearer. When we touch
the timer chip we already lose 5 usecs latency anyway.
