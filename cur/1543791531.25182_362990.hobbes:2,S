Update:
Just tried the driver with a 2.6.14 and it doesn't suffer the same 
problem.  As it looks to be doing what is required to unregister the 
chrdev, I'm loath to suggest it, but could this be a bug in the 2.6.8 
kernel?
Just a thought, so please shoot me down if I'm completly wrong :)
Cheers,
James
