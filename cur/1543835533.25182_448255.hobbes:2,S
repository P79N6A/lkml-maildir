I just tried it out with -linus (from a few hours ago).
$> cd ~/kernel/linux-2.6
$> mkdir ../o
$> make O=../o defconfig
$> make O=../o
...
$> cd ~/kernel/external
$> cat Makefile
obj-m := sam.o
sam-y := sam1.o
EXTRA_CFLAGS := -I$(src)/include
$> make M=`pwd` O=~/kernel/o -C ~/kernel/linux-2.6
make: Entering directory `/home/sam/kernel/linux-2.6'
  LD      /home/sam/kernel/external/built-in.o
  CC [M]  /home/sam/kernel/external/sam1.o
  LD [M]  /home/sam/kernel/external/sam.o
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST
  CC      /home/sam/kernel/external/sam.mod.o
  LD [M]  /home/sam/kernel/external/sam.ko
make: Leaving directory `/home/sam/kernel/linux-2.6'
So it seems to work out fine here.
Can you check that you really did a 'make prepare' in the relevant
output directory. Previously only the make *config step was needed.
