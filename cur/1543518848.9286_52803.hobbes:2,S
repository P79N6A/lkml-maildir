I'm quoting myself here, because I found out that not only ppp_deflate is
affected, there are also many other programs which fail to compile
with sig-11's, and it occurs _only_ when kernel 2.3.31 is running.
Booting the machine with any 2.2.xx kernel all programs compile
without any problems.
The problem is also independend of the gcc-version I use, the obly thing
they all have common is that the machine runs on 2.3.31 when the
sig-11's occur. The compiling process stops always at the same position,
and I can easily reproduce the behaviour.
Yes, I know the sig-11 FAQ and other documents about sig-11 but this
is definitely *no hardware problem*, it must have another cause.
So what can I do, it is a known problem or can anybody help me ?
