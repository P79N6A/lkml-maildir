Well that's nice.
btw, is something up with `make foo.lst'?  It hasn't worked for me for some
time.
bix:/usr/src/25> make mm/vmscan.lst
  MKLST   mm/vmscan.lst
BFD: Dwarf Error: Abbrev offset (3222602516) greater than or equal to .debug_abbrev size (1412).
That's with a fairly crufty old toolchain: gcc-3.3.2,
binutils-2.14.90.0.6-4.  It works OK with more contemporary toolchains.

Actually, no, the generated .lst file is wrong and basically useless.
It'd be nice to have the -fverbose-asm output appear in the .lst file too,
but it looks like you didn't patch the right thing to make that happen.
