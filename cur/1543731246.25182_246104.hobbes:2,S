This patch explains the new 2.6.xx.x bug-fix release numbering scheme 
introduced with 2.6.8.1. I hope this can help people understand how to 
patch such kernels.

     made a mistake.
+   As of kernel 2.6.8 there was a bug-fix release numbering scheme
+   introduced. In such cases a fourth number is added to the release
+   version, eg. 2.6.8.1. When patching from a 2.6.xx(.x) release to a
+   newer version, patches are to be applied against the original
+   release, eg. 2.6.8 and not the bug-fix release 2.6.8.1. Old patches
+   can be reversed by adding the "-R" option to patch.
+
     Alternatively, the script patch-kernel can be used to automate this
     process.  It determines the current kernel version and applies any
     patches found.
