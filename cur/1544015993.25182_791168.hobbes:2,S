We're speaking about the driver for the on-board NIC which is present on
almost 100% of the servers built since the last 5 years. There are an
awful lot of users of this driver playing with PXE, nfsroot and other
non-legacy boot methods. So "small handful" or not, we must ensure not
to annoy a lot of users with strange bugs and awkward configurations.

In the past, the firmware distributed with the driver was always the
one known to work with that version of the driver. Now you'll have to
know what version of the firmware to use with what kernel version,
this is adding a new dimension to troubleshooting complexity.
I still think that these firmware hacks are a solution looking for
a problem to solve. We had something which has worked well for 15
years and now it's easy to see a machine hang at boot time for 60
seconds because a firmware file is missing or invalid.
Regression IMO, I agree with Davem.
