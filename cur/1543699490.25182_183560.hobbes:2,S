I've added the following patch to this repository.  If you've already
pulled from here, feel free to just apply this single patch.  Or you can
pull from that tree again, which ever is easier for you.
It fixes a kobject bug where the parent could be deleted before the
child object, causing all sorts of badness later when we clean up the
child object.  It's been acked by Pat.
thanks,
