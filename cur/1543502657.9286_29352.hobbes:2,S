No! It should be returning the same fileid, but the file handle can be
(and usually is) different. 'No conclusions can be drawn' is just
stating that the fact that the file handles are different does not
necessarily mean that the file itself is different. Otherwise you
would conclude just that...
Look for example at what knfsd does for NFSv2:
/*
 * This is the new "dentry style" Linux NFSv2 file handle.
 *
 * The xino and xdev fields are currently used to transport the
 * ino/dev of the exported inode.
 */
struct nfs_fhbase {
        struct dentry * fb_dentry;      /* dentry cookie */
        __u32           fb_ino;         /* our inode number */
        __u32           fb_dirino;      /* dir inode number */
        __u32           fb_dev;         /* our device */
        __u32           fb_xdev;
        __u32           fb_xino;
        __u32           fb_generation;
};
Hard-link into another directory, and the file handle will
change. This sort of thing is necessary in order to keep track of
files on a UNIX-style filesystem.

The Fsid should in that case be different. That is why one should
compare both. This is the sort of problem that reexporting of
submounts introduces, and is another reason why the inode number alone
is insufficient (even under our stock NFSv2 in linux-2.x) for purposes 
of distinguishing files.

If you can't trust the server, you should not mount the
partition. There's millons of other neat tricks an evil server can
play in order to confuse the kernel. I don't think we really need to
care other than to make sure that we're robust against known server
bugs.
