The net stack does filtering for handling traffic from _untrusted_ external
sources, either for local consumtion or as a service for dumb machines
downstream, and as a way of limiting outward access to _untrusted_
users. Here we are talking of the ultimate _trusted_ user (root,
CAP_SYS_RAWIO, whatever). It makes no sense for the _kernel_ to get in the
way. Create a userland proggie for prodding IDE drives, and give it ways to
check (as far as terminal paranoia demands, a little, or not at all) as
desired. Unix ultimate simplicity is all about giving root enough rope to
shoot at his own feet.
