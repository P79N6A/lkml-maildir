Hello,
Is it possible to handle interrupts from userspace (i.e., _without_ the
help of a driver) ?? If positive, could you please give me some directions
on how to do that?? The main problem I see is how to register the
interrupt from userspace and how the kernel would call the userspace
interrupt handler ...
If this is not possible ... is there any _generic_ driver to which I could
"attach" a userspace application in order for this app to know when an
interrupt has happened ?!?!
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Ivan
