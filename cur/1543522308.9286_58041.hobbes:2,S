Good driver should not do partition-table reads in the first place.
Period. And frankly, the more I'm looking through that code the more I
believe that _any_ nontrivial conventions will be broken/misunderstood/
forgotten/not propagated by 10-20 percents of drivers. The fewer things
we have to leave for driver, the less fuckups we will get. If you don't
believe me - look through the drivers and compare.

Probably. Most likely by unregister_disk() (will go in the next chunk).
Again, I don't believe that driver writers will care to trace the policy.
No offence to anybody, but it _just_ _does_ _not_ _happen_. And I don't
give a damn for any theories - leaving the common stuff to drivers we are
inviting the Fuckup Fairy. Even for the stuff in the main tree.
