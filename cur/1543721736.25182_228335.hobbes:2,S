It should also be noted that the 'gentoo-sources' kernel that is, last I 
checked, the default (or at least the recommended kernel) for Gentoo is 
patched (1.1 MB of bzip2'd patches at the time of this writing). That 
Redhat uses their own patched kernel is no secret either.
So his statement is not only misguided, but patently false.
