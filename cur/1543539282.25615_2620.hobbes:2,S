There is an extremely lowlevel bug found that takes a fairly massive write
of the command layer in the ATA/IDE that is very hard to invoke but can be
done.  It can be disk level fatal from beginning to end in some cases.
No one has very reported a bug of this nature, but finding it and invoking
it was a long process between the two events.
The solution has one flaw in backwards compatablity.
You may not call hdparm -I /dev/hdx without a segfault in user-space.
There is a new call to reset a drive from user space if needed.
The hdparm extention will be posted on kernel.org shortly.
Cheers,
