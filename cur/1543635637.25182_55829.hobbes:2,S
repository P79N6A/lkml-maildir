You're right about that, it would be much more useful to add a
spin_assert_unlocked_all() or MUST_NOT_HOLD_ANY() macro, as Arnd
suggested.  I'll take the suggestions I've received and try to put
together a more complete patch early next week.  It'll include lock
checks for rwlocks, semaphores, and rwsems as well as the global
no-locks-held macro.  And as an added bonus, I'll even try to test it
:).
Thanks,
Jesse
