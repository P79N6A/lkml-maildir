I tested the card in a different, more beefy box, namely a shoebox PC, 
whereas the problem box is one with an external power supply coming in 
via cable. 
In the shoebox PC the card works fine.  In the shoebox, this problem 
CARDBUS card (CARDBUS to USB 2.0 adapter) is running on a PCI card, 
which is a separate "PCI to CARDBUS" PCI card.  The PCI card has a 
PCI_DEVICE_ID_RICOH_RL5C475 part, which is under control of the 
yenta_socket driver just fine.
So the "problem USB 2.0 adapter card" works OK with yenta_socket.c from 
2.6.10 on the RICOH cardbus chip.  The problem is with the TI1520 chip 
in the embedded machine on the embedded motherboard.  What we do not 
know is if the problem is with:
1) TI1520 chip/yenta combo, or
2) embedded PC/power supply
Any last gasping ideas?
Thank you all again,
Dick
