Yeah, it does seem that rehashing before actually calling d_move() means 
that there is a small window where another process might now come in, and 
use the dcache (without getting the semaphore) to see the old value of the 
target dentry, even though the low-level filesystem has already move the 
new dentry value over the target. Ie the window would be between
		i_op->rename(...)
	d_rehash(new_dentry)
	... race here ...
	d_move(old_dentry, new_dentry)
That might confuse a filesystem that expected that the target was deleted 
an no longer reachable by anybody.
Al? What do you think?
