You'll find that there is a problem with 2.2.12, on down - with losing a
few bytes here and there.
The bug is in the tty subsystem - in that when you pass off chars to the
ldisc - from the driver, the ldisc doesn't actually write them.  (I could
get into the details, but you probably don't care.)
upgrade to 2.2.17.
It takes care of that bug.
Now. You *NEED* to understand that the way cdrecord does things, is by
sending control codes (lots of them) to your tty, to achieve the "oOoOo"
effect.
9600bps should be okay - on any reasonable system, to NEVER flow control.
But the *MOMENT* you bank on that, you'll get burned.
Set up flow control. if you don't, you're asking for trouble.
