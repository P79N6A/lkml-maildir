You're right, I think the arch code should probably worry about this.

Yep, I think it is bogus.  There's only one caller on ia64 that would be
affected--swiotlb_init(), and afaik multi-node systems won't be using
that code (except maybe NEC?), so even if the pgdat list is out of order
we should be ok.  If not I'll fix the ia64 discontig code.
Thanks,
