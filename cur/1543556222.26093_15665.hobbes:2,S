Exactly that's why I compile nearly everything as modules :-)
The other reason is that the turn-around times for driver hacking
are *much* smaller (until you managed to code a bug which kills
your box...).

Just because you don't like it?  No.  Get real.  Most newer gui mixer's
I've seen allow you to switch between mixer devices with tab's.  Even
the other ones allow you to specify the device you want to use.  And if
you will never ever use tvmixer just disable it.

Control volume/bass/treble of the TV card (assuming the hardware allows
this, doesn't work with all cards).

That's why most people don't need it.  If you would have connected your
speakers directly to the TV card without the soundcard (+ assorted mixer)
inbetween you would probably love tvmixer...
