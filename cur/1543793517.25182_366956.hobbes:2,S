No, there is a place for ego, an essential place.  Some of the best
hackers on lkml have no shortage of ego.  They just don't get their ego
too closely attached to any particular piece of code or technical
position.  Rather they take pride in their willingness and ability to
find better answers (even in their own work, done five minutes ago ;).
I don't normally quote Colin Powell (a recent U.S. Secretary of State),
but this one time he said it well:
	Avoid having your ego so close to your position that
	when your position falls, your ego goes with it.
					-- Colin Powell
Ego deficient pansies risk wilting on lkml.
