You can't because it doesn't go through the interfaces you're hooking
into.  Existing interfaces are "changed" to point at the UARTs using
setserial, which does its work via an ioctl.

Not specifically only userland - if it happens to be set when the port
is registered then enable PPS support then as well.
So:
1. uart_configure_port - if UPF_HARDPPS_CD is set, register the port
   for PPS support.
2. uart_remove_one_port - if UPF_HARDPPS_CD is set, unregister the port
   for PPS support.
3. uart_set_info - if changing UPF_HARDPPS_CD, appropriately register or
   unregister the port for PPS support.
PS, linuxpps@ml.enneenne.com dropped from the cc: since it rejects my
postings.
