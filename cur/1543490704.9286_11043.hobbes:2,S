Hi 
Does anyone knows how to trace a kernel stack corruption error??
I use a program wich performs ioctl to an experimental network driver of 
my own
At the end of this process ( when the release() function is called ), it 
seems that the usual contents of the kernel_stack_page element 
(0xdeadbeef) from the task_struct strucure has been crushed somewhere ( 
I don t know how it is possible 'cause I don t play with any 
task_struct...)
