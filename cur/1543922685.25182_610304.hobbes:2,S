See scripts/kconfig/Makefile:
Here we use (in the x86 case):
Kconfig := arch/$(SRCARCH)/Kconfig.$(ARCH)
So the "i386" comes from ARCH equals to i386.
The advantage is that the patch to kconfig
is generic so other arch's can use SRCARCH if they like
without having a hardcoded list in the kconfig Makefile.
