Erm... Linus, if you assume that semaphore on the path to hashed dentry
may stop anybody from getting it you may want to look into cached_lookup().
It doesn't touch semaphores at all. So even if semaphores are hold on /,
/foo and /foo/bar lookup on "/foo/bar/baz" will go through if /foo/bar/baz
is already in dcache.

	D'oh. Now, if it would be the only bad thing about rename()...
In essence, we have it serialized by a per-fs lock. It's done in each
fs separately. And it prevents us from moving other generic tests to VFS,
where they belong. I'ld be more than happy to have this puppet moved to
vfs_rename(), along with is_subdir() stuff and check for source and target
having the same inode. Then foo_rename()s would start to look sane. But it
requires adding new fields to struct super (lock and wait queue) [1]. If
you'll give clearance I'll do it ASAP.

Heh. I would be more than grateful if you'll allow me to do that. rename()
is *the* ugliest namespace-related method. Having all generic tests in VFS
would make life much easier when we'll go for making VFS SMP-safe. BTW,
the less parts of VFS are scattered over all fs drivers the more
inpenedent all filesystems become. I.e. less pain in ass for folks
maintaining AFS, ARLA, DMSDOS, r/w HPFS, etc.

[2] BTW, life would be *much* easier if we'ld keep fs-specific parts of
inode and super allocated separately. I did it for ext2 and it seems to
work fine. If it would be done for all filesystems the memory usage would
decrease for almost everybody.
