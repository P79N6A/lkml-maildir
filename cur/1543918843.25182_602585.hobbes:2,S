Why would anyone need more than 640k... In addition to NUMA, who can 
tell what some future hardware might do, given that the size of memory 
is expanding as if it were covered in Moore's Law. As memory sizes 
increase someone will bump the page size again. Better to Let people 
make it as large as they feel they need and warn at build time 
performance may suck.
