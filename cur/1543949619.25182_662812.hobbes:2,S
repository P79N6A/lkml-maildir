Subject: [PATCH] KBUILD:  Allow generalization of "unifdef" utility.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/3/450

Allow the user to override the selection of "unifdef" utility when
generating user-space header files.  This allows the user to select
the more powerful "sunifdef" program, which is more stringent with
respect to cleaning and syntax checking.

  obviously, if a user chooses to not take advantage of this feature,
it should make no difference whatsoever.  but "sunifdef" is more
strict in terms of cleaning compound preprocessor directives, and it
also flags questionable preprocessor directives like this:
  UNIFDEF include/linux/netlink.h
sunifdef: /home/rpjday/k/git/include/linux/netlink.h: line 206:
warning 0x02070: Garbage following preprocessor directive in "#if
PAGE_SIZE < 8192UL" (#if line 152 depth 2)
