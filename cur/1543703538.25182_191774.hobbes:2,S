The sector for I/O error is 54128, which is somewhere withing journal (at the
beginning of a disk). What was the problem inside of the drive is not very
clear, as modern drives are sort of black-boxes.

Well, there was affect on filesystem - the write have failed.
Also may be later that block was remapped, or that was internal drive's logic
failure or something else like that.
This journal block won't be used on subsequent mount (because transaction
was not closed), but will be just
overwritten. So even if its content was corrupted, reiserfs does not care.
