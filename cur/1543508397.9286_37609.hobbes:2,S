Buy real modem. Apart of general design flaw in the whole WinModem idea there
are also documentation problem. Or lack of it. 3COM does not provide any
usefull documetation for the beast so writing of driver is [almost] impossible.

No. It is not supported and never will be supported till 3COM keep documentation
for it in secrect. At most you'll be able to get binery-only driver only to
find out that it can not be used with latest version of linux kernel...

Try to get some documentation first :-))

This is main problem. There are NO specs. At least free ones.

Of course ! Just like any WinModem.
