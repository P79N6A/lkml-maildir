I wasn't really aiming for performance optimization.  I agree that we
have to live with barriers but it's also true that they and other
synchronization constructs can be difficult to understand and thus to
verify, so IMHO, when it comes to synchronization constructs, it's best
stick to or make things look similar to more established ways, so that
people can categorize the usage and understand it more easily.
Locked enter/leave model, where each cpu has its own lock and whatever
entity enters and leaves a cpu while holding the respective per-cpu
lock, guarantees that while holding a per-cpu lock, no one enters or
leaves the cpu.  It's conceptually simple and basically the semantic
that we're all trying to achieve here.
I think things can be made more similar to the locked enter/leave model
using the extra bit by putting manipulation and testing of the bit into
accesor functions, so readability was my primary concern not
performance.  But, then again, we can probably make the barrier() model
readable enough too with proper accessor functions and plenty of
comments above them.
