HI,
    These day i wanted get cpu context ,when interrupt came.BUT i
found when interrupt came kernel saved cpu context in struct pt_regs
and delivered to do_IRQ ,and i print the pt_regs->eip,they alway same
on the same interrupt?
     The interrupt can come anytime,i think the eip will be very
different every time.BUT i debug kernel ,print eip in the function
do_IRQ,found it didn't run as i thought.Can anybody tell me why?
sincerely yours
