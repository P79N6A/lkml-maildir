Absolutely agree.  I would love to separate the initcall order from
directory and Makefile order, using a clean and well documented method
of describing initialisation order.  But there is one massive problem
with changing the existing method, .... Linus likes it this way.
Maybe after kbuild 2.5 is in.  I have learnt to fight one battle at a
time.
