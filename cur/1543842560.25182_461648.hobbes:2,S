there are workers out there which expect to be started priveldged, do
something (bind, suid, ...) and then drop priveledges. If those check if the
drop is needed based on the euid...
Of course this can be solved better, however i remeber that those cases are
the ones where compatibility means any priveledge -> euid = 0.
Anyway, I think there is something like that in the proposed patch, so it
looks good.
