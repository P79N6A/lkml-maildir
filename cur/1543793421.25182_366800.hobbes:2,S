Ouch, this one is really ugly.
If you want to go this way, then you should instead add an X86_FEATURE_SMP 
that gets cleared on UP and on SMP with just one core (and detect when CPU 
hotplug ain't gonna happen ;), and then do
	#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	#define smp_alternative(x,y) alternative(x,y,X86_FEATURE_SMP)
	#else
	#define smp_alternative(x,y) asm(x)
	#endif
or something similar, instead of creating a totally new infrastructure to 
do the thing that "alternative()" already does.
(Yeah, the above doesn't really work, since usually the SMP form is the 
longer one, and "alternative()" wants the long complex one first. So maybe 
the x86 feature needs to be "X86_FEATURE_UP" instead, since it's now a 
"feature" to only have one core ;)
