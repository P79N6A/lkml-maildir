Perhaps a better way to put it would be that a thread preempted in
an RCU read-side critical section boosts itself, and tracks the fact
that it boosted itself in its tasks structure.
The second boost would be from some other task, but if the task had 
already boosted itself, the de-boosting would already be taken care of
at the next rcu_read_unlock() -- but as mentioned earlier in this
thread, you only boost someone else if they are not currently running.

Lock holder as in task 0 holds the lock, perhaps in an RCU read-side
critical section and perhaps not.  Task 1 is in an RCU read-side
critical section and attempts to acquire the lock.  Task 1 must block,
because task 0 still holds the lock.  Task 1 must boost itself before
blocking, and must donate its boosted priority to task 0.

I am getting the impression that #3 is something to leave aside for now.

The idea is that none of this stuff ever happens except in cases where
the RCU read-side critical section blocks, in which case all this is
in the noise compared to the context switch.  The sole exception to
this is that rcu_read_unlock() must check to see if it has been boosted,
and deboost itself if so.  I don't particularly like the additional
comparison, but it should not be too expensive.

One idea is to put tasks that block in RCU read-side critical sections
on a list -- again, the hope is that the overhead is in the noise compared
to the context switch.

Let me make sure I understand what you are suggesting -- sounds to me
like a check in preempt_schedule().  If the task to be preempted is
higher priority than the ceiling, the preemption request is refused.
Or am I missing part of your proposal?
