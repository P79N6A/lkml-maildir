Hello!
I need use sleep with accurat timing.
I use 2.6.21 with rt-prempt patch.
with enabled rt_preempt, dyn_ticks, and local_apic
But
req.tv_nsec = 300000;
req.tv_sec = 0;
nanosleep(&req,NULL)
make pause around 310-330 microseconds.
I tried to understend how work nanosleep(), but it not depends from
jiffies and from smp_apic_timer_interrupt.
When can accuracy be lost?
And how are process waked up?
