It's not going to get much heavier than how I'm beating on it.
Although it seems my box is mighty bored during 64 simultaneous
tiobench 256's (i.e. 16384 tasks). I got bored & compiled a kernel:
make -j64 bzImage  304.60s user 848.70s system 694% cpu 2:46.05 total
The cpus are 95+% idle except for when I touch /proc/, where the task
fishing around /proc/ gets stuck spinning hard in the kernel for
anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours before killing it succeeds.
It didn't quite finish the run, as the tty deadlock happened again. The
VM doesn't appear to be oopsing, though I should slap on the OOM fixes.
Cheers,
Bill
