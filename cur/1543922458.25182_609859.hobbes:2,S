This is a mini-release of my series, rebased on -rt2.  I have more changes
downstream which are not quite ready for primetime, but I need to work on some
other unrelated issues right now and I wanted to get what works out there. 
Changes since v5
*) Rebased to rt2 - Many of the functions of the original series are now
 included in base -rt so they are dropped out
