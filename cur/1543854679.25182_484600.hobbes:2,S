Yes, but you don't find it normally in the documentation, just
in some very dark corners of the code.

Well, if you claim that then i386 misimplements it too. 
Normally people don't hit it on 32bit because with the default user/kernel split
the limit is 900MB, which tends to be ok for most hardware. But you
could easily hit it with non standard __PAGE_OFFSET as it is now
possible to configure. 
I claim x86-64 is bug to bug compatible to i386 as far as possible. 
Since that is what drivers are typically written for it's the most
important specification.

If it did like you're recommending a huge number of drivers
in the tree wouldn't work anymore (just think about what pci_alloc_consistent
does) 
I have a long term master plan to merge GFP_DMA and swiotlb
into a single pool -- if that ever happens it might be possible
to fix it properly. But probably most of the drivers who needed
it wouldn't work anyways because they typically tend to forget
enough *_sync calls to make software bounce buffering work.
