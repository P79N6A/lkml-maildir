That was not the point of the example Linus gave.
The example Linus gave was a function taking a pid_t argument and then 
comparing the value of the argument passed against 0xffff - the /value/ of 
the pid_t argument passed, not the size of the datatype.
        int fn(pid_t a)
        {
                if (a > 0xffff)
                        ...
        }
if pid_t is 16 bit, then the value can never be greater than 0xffff but, 
if pid_t is greater than 16 bit, say 32 bit, then the argument "a" could 
very well contain a value greater than 0xffff and then the comparison 
makes perfect sense. So, while you'd get a warning on architectures where 
pid_t is 16bit or less you won't get a warning when pid_t is greater than 
16 bit. "fixing" that warning would clearly be wrong, no argument about 
that.
