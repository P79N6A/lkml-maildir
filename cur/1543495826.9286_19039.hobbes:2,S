It affects only those binaries that have source code -- the ruling is
based on source code as a language (even though it's not a spoken language
--- the judge rules it under freedom of speech).  From what I read, the
9th Circuit court ruling is the law until the US Supreme Court overturns
it -- period.  And I have a feeling that it will NOT be overturned by the
supreme court.

It seems to me that if the export controls on the crypto are released in
the US for open-source projects, that the groups could base themselves in
the United States.  It seems to me like that would work, wouldn't it?
It seems that currently, the US Government is saying, "Sure, Open-sourced
software may be exported 'cuz we can crack it then if we need to."
They'll think that, and not say it, anyway.  But, that's not necessarily
correct.  We'll see what they think about it then.

France doesn't even allow PGP use in email for crypto!  That sux!  But,
I've read that they're going to be lifting them and replacing some of the
laws so that what will happen is that crypto exportation and use will be
legal, but not at all during declared times of war.

Um, where?  We're talking about the crypto in the Linux kernel -- it is a
bit off topic, but still, this is an issue that DOES pertain to the
kernel.
BTW, can someone give me a link to this so called "reiser fs"?
