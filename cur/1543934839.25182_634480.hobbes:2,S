Power implements WARN_ON this way, and all the machinery is in place to
generically implement WARN_ON that way if you want.  It does generate
denser code than the call (since its just a single trapping instruction
with no need for argument setup), and the performance cost of the trap
shouldn't matter if warnings are rare (which one would hope).
