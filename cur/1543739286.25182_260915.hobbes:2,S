OK, am probably confused, but I thought that the whole point of your
PREEMPT_REALTIME implementation of rcu_read_lock_rt() was to enable
preemption in the RCU read-side critical section.  If this is indeed
the case, then it looks to me like code that would run in softirq/bh/irq
context in a kernel compiled non-PREEMPT_REALTIME could now run during
the time that a code path running under rcu_read_lock_rt() was preempted.
If so, then the kernel can end up freeing a data item that the preempted
RCU read-side critical section is still referencing.
OK, so what am I missing here?
						Thanx, Paul
