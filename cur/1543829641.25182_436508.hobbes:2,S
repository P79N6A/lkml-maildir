I can't really use this, since it sprinkles changes all over the patch
series.  Three separate patches would have been better, although even that
would be a hassle.
Anyway, I just edited the diffs, got most of it.
What does this
-	READAHEAD_DEBUGFS_ENTRY_U32(debug_level);
+	debugfs_create_u32("debug_level", 0644, root, &readahead_debug_level);
do?
