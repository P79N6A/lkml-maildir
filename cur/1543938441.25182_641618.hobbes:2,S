my feeling is that this is some sort of timing dependent race in 
konqueror/kde/qt that is exposed when a different scheduler is put in.
If it disappears with CFS-v24.1 it is probably just because the timings 
will change again. Would be nice to debug this on the konqueror side and 
analyze why it fails and how. You can probably tune the timings by 
enabling SCHED_DEBUG and tweaking /proc/sys/kernel/*sched* values - in 
particular sched_latency and the granularity settings. Setting wakeup 
granularity to 0 might be one of the things that could make a 
difference.
