at least it's not security related :)

yes it is.
Thanks and sorry for your troubles. BTW, if you read back my first post
about the blkdev-pagecache you'll notice I got bitten by the same bug
too and I had to reinstall the test-machine from scratch :). 2.4.10
didn't had such bug, but after integrating the direct-io with the blkdev
inode physical address space the bug seen the light again. I should have
fixed the below way since the first place, at that time there were two
functions anyways and so it was less obvious the below was the right fix
(previously I just did a one liner to fix it (s/dev/rdev/)).
