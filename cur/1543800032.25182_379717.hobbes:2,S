Is that actually true of all gcc4 versions? I seem to remember gcc-4.0 
being a real stinker.

I'd still prefer to see numbers with -funit-at-a-time only. I think it's 
an independent knob, and I'd be much less worried about that, because we 
do know that unit-at-a-time has been enabled on x86-64 for a long time 
("forever"). So that's less of a change, I feel.
