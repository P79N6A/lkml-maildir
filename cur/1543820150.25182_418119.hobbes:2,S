Thanks for getting that, David.  As you observe, it doesn't involve
shm at all, and the only mprotect is PROT_NONE.  Do the abbreviated
messages in the final lines of the trace fit with the errors you
were originally reporting?  (I think so.)  Or is this particular
trace failing for some other reason, earlier than before, and we
need to try something else to identify the problem?

To judge by this trace, I'd have to say that your problem has
nothing whatever to do with the shm/mprotect fix in 2.6.16.6,
and we've no evidence yet to complicate that fix.  Interestingly,
nobody else has so far reported any problem with it.
Judging by the mmap addresses throughout the trace (top down, from
0x37f2e000), it looks like you've got CONFIG_VMSPLIT_1G (not a good
choice for a box with only 1G of RAM: whereas CONFIG_VMSPLIT_3G_OPT
would maximize your userspace while avoiding the need for HIGHMEM);
and with the above 832M mmap, the remaining hole in user address
space is just too small to hold it.
But that leaves me quite unable to explain why you should have
thought the shm/mprotect patch responsible, and why you should
find the more complicated version works.  Stack randomization
changes the numbers a little, but I think not enough to explain
how it sometimes could fit 832M in there, sometimes not.
Tell me I'm talking nonsense and we'll have another go:
I guess adding some printks on top of the "replacement"
patch, so it can tell us when it's having an effect.
