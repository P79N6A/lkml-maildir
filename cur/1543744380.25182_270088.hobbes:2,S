The problem is that the information you can get out of /etc/modprobe.conf
or some script is not necessarily consistent. Maybe the module was
hand-loaded using different parameters that the ones in the script.
This is the same issue as with the in-kernel .config. We have this
today because this way we're sure we are looking at the right one,
not an older copy which happen to be in /boot. Same thing for KKSYMOOPS.
Yes, this wastes a bit of memory (quite a lot actually for KKCONFIG
or KKSYMOOPS), but less and less people cares. And those who really
care (embedded people etc) can disable this with a config option.
If module parameters are a memory issue, maybe we should do the same
as above: put all of them into /sys unless chosen otherwise, and in
this case disable all of them, since we can go just fine without
any module parameter in /sys.
Stelian.
