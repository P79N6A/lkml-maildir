It looks like my router is able to re-map its IP to the corresponding private 
IP but then this packet is bridged instead of routed (or encrypted). 
Unfortunately, IPSEC routing is not listet in this image.

I tried 
ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING -p ipv4 --ip-destination 192.168.0.0/16 -j DROP
but this does not change anything (192.168.0.0/16 is my private, masqueraded 
network).  But nothing changed. I'm thinking about replacing my IPSEC VPN 
with an openvpn tunnel. Maybe then I'll have less problems.
regards,
Jörg
