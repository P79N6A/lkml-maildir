This is getting off topic, this has nothing to do with the kernel. You are
free to do whatever you want in userspace, if you have the right 
capabilities. You're also free to write your own userspace tools, which
protects the user from any danger, but it belongs in userspace not in
the kernel. So please go the KDE/Gnome/... guys and whine there.
bye, Roman
