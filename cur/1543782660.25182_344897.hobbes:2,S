Subject: [PATCH 2/7] [PATCH] NPTL signal delivery deadlock fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any  objections, please let us know.
------------------
This bug is quite subtle and only happens in a very interesting
situation where a real-time threaded process is in the middle of a
coredump when someone whacks it with a SIGKILL. However, this deadlock
leaves the system pretty hosed and you have to reboot to recover.
Not good for real-time priority-preemption applications like our
telephony application, with 90+ real-time (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR)
processes, many of them multi-threaded, interacting with each other for
high volume call processing.
