Thanks.  Looks like an unsigned variable going negative:-(
I made the mistake of only testing it with a linear array with all
components the same size.
Please verify that this patch fixes it.
Thanks,

###Comments for ChangeSet
Fix problem with unsigned variable going "negative" in linear.c
We replace 'size' by 'start'.
'start' means exactly the same as 'curr_offset - size', and
the equivalence of the new code can be tested based on this.
The difference is that 'start' will never be negative and so can
fit in a 'sector_t' while 'size' could be negative.
Also make curr_offset sector_t, as it should have been.
