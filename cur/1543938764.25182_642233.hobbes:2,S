This causes a regression .. When printk is called during an OOPS in
kernels without this change then the OOPS will get logged, since the
logging process (klogd) is woken to handle the messages.. If you apply
this change klogd doesn't wakeup, and hence doesn't log the oops.. So if
you remove the wakeup here you have to add it someplace else to maintain
the logging ..
(I'm not theorizing here, I have defects logged against this specific
piece of code..)
