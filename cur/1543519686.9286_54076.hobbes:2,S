	That assumes that the two threads are sharing a lot of changing context
data. If that were true, no other method will be more efficient than
multithreading. Shared memory, for example, will be no more efficient.

	If you care about performance, you shouldn't care about this.
High-performance news servers don't worry about starving a web serving
program. High-performance name servers don't worry about starving a mail
program. Again, the alternative (multiple processes) would cause the same
problem.

	Not so either. Caches handle shared unchanging data just fine.
	Overall -- Nonesense. If you're considering multiple threads or multiple
processors, multiple threads are a win all around.
	1) You might have fewer context switches. A thread that can keep picking up
whatever work happens to need to be done can run longer than a process that
can only do work for a single connection/job.
	2) You might have less expensive context switches. Thread context switches
will require less work since the vm won't change.
	3) You might be more responsive. In a multiprocess solution, an ambushed
process will freeze whatever work was assigned to that connection. In a
multithreaded solution, it will only stall the job that thread was doing --
other jobs can then be taken over by other threads.
	There are several other factors that weigh in favor or threads, but these
are probably the three biggest.
