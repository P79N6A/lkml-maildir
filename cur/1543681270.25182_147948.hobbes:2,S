Hi people!
After having problems compiling nforce2-drivers for 2.6.0-test1, I had a
look after include/linux/pci.h.
There is some inconsistency in there:
   pci_driver->driver_data is not there any more BUT in pci_dynids it is
referenced:
       unsigned int use_driver_data:1; /* pci_driver->driver_data is
used */
attached a dirty patch:
diff -u linux-2.6.0-test1/include/linux/pci.h
linux-2.6.0-test1.new/include/linux/pci.h

 struct pci_dynids {
        spinlock_t lock;            /* protects list, index */
        struct list_head list;      /* for IDs added at runtime */
-       unsigned int use_driver_data:1; /* pci_driver->driver_data is
used */
+       unsigned int use_driver_data:0; /* pci_driver->driver_data is
NOT there any more */
 };
btw: this driver_data is used by the networking part of the
nforce2-driver. If anybody knows a hint, tell me. 
Else I will try to wake up someone at nvidia.
