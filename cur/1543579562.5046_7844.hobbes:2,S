I got a report which indicates it may not be a good idea, especially
for UDP. Suppose you have a lousy LAN or NFS UDP server for whatever
reason, some NFS/UDP packets may get lost very easily while a ping
request may get through. In that case, the rpc ping may slow down
the NFS client over UDP significantly.
