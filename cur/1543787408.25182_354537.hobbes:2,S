Well, I was trying to describe what I am going to follow the NTP patches
with. 
So yes, the reduced NTP rework patches are not discussed in the above
(but ntp_advance() does have a place in the above, I just left it out to
shorten the comparison), but they allow the two examples above to look
similar. 
For clarity here's the ntp details included
update_wall_clock():
	ticks = jiffies - wall_jiffies
	while (ticks):
		ticks--
		xtime += tick_nsec + ntp_adjustment
		ntp_advance(tick_nsec)
timekeeping_periodic_hook():
	now = timesource_read(ts)
	delta_cycle = now - last
	while (delta_cycle > interval_cycle):
		delta_cycle -= interval_cycle
		system_time += interval_nsec
		ntp_advance(interval_nsec)

Commenting the specific code would help clarify this. If I'm
understanding you, you're talking about the following logic:
static void ntp_advance(unsigned long interval_ns):
	static unsigned long interval_sum;
	/* increment the interval sum */
	interval_sum += interval_ns
	/* calculate the per tick singleshot adjtime adjustment step */
	while (interval_ns >= tick_nsec):
		time_adjust_step = time_adjust
		if (time_adjust_step):
			time_adjust_step = min(time_adjust_step, tickadj)
			time_adjust_step = max(time_adjust_step, -tickadj)
			time_adjust -= time_adjust_step
		interval_ns -= tick_nsec
I'm not sure I understand the problem if time_adjust_step becomes
negative.

Well, that's evolution. :)  But really, the reduced ntp rework stuff
isn't a cleanup. Its just the bare minimum changes to NTP that I'm
needing for my generic timeofday code. Hopefully the reduced changes
will clarify what exactly I need (or think I need ;) from the NTP
subsystem to get my timekeeping code to function properly. Then maybe
you (or anyone else - don't let Roman have all the fun) can point to a
better way.

I'm sorta going at it from the other way (call me optimistic :), where
I'm trying to unify what I can until I hit the exception. Then I'll
happily break out an arch specific gettimeofday implementation.
Once again, I do appreciate your feedback. Hopefully I'll have patches
out later today for you to look at.
thanks
