I noticed that in 2.3.18-ac1, double_lock() wsa moved into dcache.h, and
the comment about the function was changed:
- "Happyly there are only two VFS operations that do this.."
+ "Happyly there is only one VFS operation that does this.."
IIRC, double_lock() is required for "do_rmdir()" and "do_rename()", so
there are still 2 VFS operations which use this function.
