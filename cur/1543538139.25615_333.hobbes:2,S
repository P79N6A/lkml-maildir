But the problem is the same - what good will your throughput be if your
burner process is not run for 500ms? You need A LOT of throughput to be
able to catch up several latency hits...
[ok, There is a lot of buffer on cd writers - but it will prevent going
 faster]
The problem is exactly the same - you stream data to a device.
The device interrupts when it needs more data.
The actual program is not run.....
You get a drop out.
With audio you get audible disturbance, with CD writing you get a
destroyed CD...
