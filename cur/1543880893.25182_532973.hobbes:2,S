Dave,
Multithread is not set.
Here is the output of my instrumentation:
Linux agpgart interface v0.101 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: DEBUG 0
agpgart: DEBUG 1
__pci_register_driver: In function
__pci_register_driver: driver = agpgart-amdk7, multithread = 0
__pci_register_driver: Before Spinlock
__pci_register_driver: Before List Init
__pci_register_driver: Before Driver Register
__pci_register_driver: Error = 0
__pci_register_driver: Returning 0
The DEBUG 0 and 1 are coming from agp_amdk7_init()
There is a DEBUG 2 at the top of agp_amdk7_probe(), even before
pci_find_capability, but the function never gets called.
I assume an error of 0 means no conflict.  Any further steps to take for
this?  I would really like my AGP working :S
Especially since lspci obviously detects it, even tells me it supports
1x, 2x and 4x.
PreZ :S
