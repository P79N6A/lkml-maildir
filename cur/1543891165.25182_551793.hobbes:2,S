Not necessarily priveleged - you most likely already change ownership
of event devices to user who is logged at console (so your force feedback
joysticks work).

I think we should aim at the most common case - when there are no multiple
users on the box. Then the utility that detects KEY_UNKNOWN just saves the
mapping user chose and automatically reload keymap upon next reboot.
Note that KEY_UNKNOWN solution does not preculde futher customization on
per-user base once default action is established.

No, it is not a niche case. I think it is much more common than the case where
you have multiple users for the same box using different keymaps. Even if box
is shared there most likely will be one person setting it up in the beginning
and the rest will follow his/her setup.
