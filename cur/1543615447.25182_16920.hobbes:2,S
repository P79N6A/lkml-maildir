If I give the old coffepot to Aunt Tillie with Linux, I'll take some care
of the updates and such for her later. And for sanity's sake I'll stick to
distribution-build kernels if at all possible in any case.

Right. But for Aunt Tillie who has to do the managing of the machine by
herself, she'll either go to a distribution and won't fool around with
compiling 2.4.18preX for the sake of it, or is at least mildly interested
in kernel development and doesn't need handholding. Why an average
(non-hacker) Aunt Tillie won't be satisfied with e.g. Red Hat or Madrake or
whatever kernel or an update is just way beyond me. Source-build kernels
are strictly "check out this new feature" or "see if it breaks", or perhaps
"need a custom configuration for this piece of junk from the scrapheap" not
for day-to-day use by unwashed masses.
