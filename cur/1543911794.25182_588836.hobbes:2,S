Hrm, actually, I don't think such have_arch_cmpxchg() macro will be
required at all because of the small performance hit disabling
preemption will have on the slow and fast paths. Let's compare, for each
of the slow path and fast path, what locking looks like on architecture
with and without local cmpxchg:
What we actually do here is:
fast path:
with local_cmpxchg:
  preempt_disable()
  preempt_enable()
without local_cmpxchg:
  preempt_disable()
  local_irq_save
  local_irq_restore
  preempt_enable()
    (we therefore disable preemption _and_ disable interrupts for
    nothing)
slow path:
both with and without local_cmpxchg():
  preempt_disable()
  preempt_enable()
  local_irq_save()
  local_irq_restore()
Therefore, we would add preempt disable/enable to the fast path of
architectures where local_cmpxchg is emulated with irqs off. But since
preempt disable/enable is just a check counter increment/decrement with
barrier() and thread flag check, I doubt it would hurt performances
enough to justify the added complexity of disabling interrupts for the
whole fast path in this case.
