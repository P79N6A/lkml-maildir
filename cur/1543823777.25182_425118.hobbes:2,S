Stubs or something calling the normal unwinder are fine.

At some point they will probably, but ok - keep them private for now.

Linux is not written in ISO-C, it's Linux C. And in that uN types are used, not uintN_t

Well it's like this all over the kernel. You can run Lindent if you prefer, but
usually it takes more work to clean up after it. It's also part of that "Linux C" thing.

seqlock doesn't really take a look in the classical sense. The only way to make it 
lock up would be to have another CPU livelocking on this in a loop.
Anyways most likely it isn't needed because of the stop_machine and can be removed

GFP_USER is for user space pages only.

Those never set CONFIG_FP
