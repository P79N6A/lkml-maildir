Yes I saw this check and misinterpreted it initially also.
I actually think 'overflow' is still correct since its testing for the
calcuated size (directory entry) being larger than the size reported
by the filesystem (storage).
I still submit my patch to Linus et. al. for consideration that also
detects overflow in the case of a v 1.12 PX entry. I may have time to
build a git kernel today or tomorrow and actually test it against a RR
iso image.

Yes. If it is actually correct it allows for the use of iget_locked()
in isofs/inode.c instead of iget5_locked() (per
Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt). Though I'll let a real VFS person
decide if that has any advantages.
