The abstractions are one big mistake IMHO. But in context their origin
is easy to understand. The original goal was to support a lot of
platforms and to minimise code writing. The Mesa layer uses this kind of
templating a lot and for the 3D client side code its a real win.
Someone I think took them a stage too far and into a place that it
didn't work out.
The memory manager is a bit more complex, a lot of drivers do have
different needs for memory management and some of it has to be client
side. Its also a really really hot path when doing direct render.

SiS and VIA do as well. Both of them overdo the kernel side work and it
hurts performance however.
