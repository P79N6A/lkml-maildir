Now read back and see that that is very close to what I said.

The biggest problem is the huge collection of workarounds we have
for PowerPC alone already -- if that can be moved into some
quirk collection thing, where certain quirks are only run on some
systems, it might scale.
You'll also have to deal with endianness finally (you can *not*
access an integer property via an int*).
It will be easiest to start with a biggish collection of hooks,
that doesn't require too much code change, and slowly converge
stuff.

All properties can be changed, any new property can be created.
Oh you mean after you killed OF -- yeah, it gets a bit harder
then eh :-)
