I don't really care too much about ACPI further than the power_off function. I 
submitted a patch a while ago to attempt each available power_off function in 
turn - so that if the ACPI one failed, the system would attempt the APM 
function, if present.
But why does USB end up on IRQ 10 with CONFIG_ACPI - and IRQ 19 otherwise?
How does ACPI in the _kernel_ affect the IRQ routing? I thought Linux didn't 
reroute IRQs - so whatever the BIOS sets up ought to be the same whatever 
Linux is configured to do?
