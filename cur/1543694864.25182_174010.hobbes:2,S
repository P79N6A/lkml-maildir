Thanks.  I'll test this and reply with the results.

The definition in <include/linux/ide.h> is only used if IDE_ARCH_ACK_INTR is
not defined.  sgiioc4.c defines IDE_ARCH_ACK_INTR before including that file,
so I believe we get the definition we want without touching ide.h, don't we?

Yes.  It may be that since name is an array, the value passed to request_region
was the offset of name in the structure.  Since that was never dereferenced,
things worked okay.  In any case, the code was obviously incorrect.

These look fine.
I'll await a response on the IDE_ARCH_ACK_INTR issue.  Do you want me to send
another patch, or is the previous with your update sufficient?
thanks
