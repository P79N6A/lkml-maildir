Please tell me your joking.  Linux' crappy suspend support is a common 
reason people give me for not wanting Linux anywhere near their laptops.  
I have a single boot laptop that's somewhat of a mobile debugging station 
that needs Linux and I absolutely hate it.  Right now my laptop takes far 
too long to boot and even if it didn't I wish I could suspend.
I'm actually a huge Linux fan.. I use it exclusively on my server and on 
my PC but if I get another laptop I will probably run something else on 
it.  Linux is just too annoying for that use.
