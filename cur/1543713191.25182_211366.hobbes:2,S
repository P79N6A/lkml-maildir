Subject: mm-kernels, 4K stacks, and NVIDIA... am I crazy?

I've been seeing posts on LKML, various forums, information sites, 
etc. stating that the 4K stacks patch included with the latest mm 
series kernels is incompatible with Nvidia's binary drivers.  Even my 
own friends have told me they were unable to get Nvidia drivers to 
work with mm kernels.
However, I've been using pretty much every mm release for the last two 
weeks (currently on 2.6.5-rc3-mm3) with the latest Nvidia driver 
(5336) and, as far as I can tell, 4K stacks enabled:
06:55:05 <+delysid|~> grep 4K /usr/src/linux/.config
CONFIG_4KSTACKS=y
06:55:08 <+delysid|~>
And I have yet to have a single problem.  In fact, everything is 
working swimmingly!
So the question is... am I crazy?  Is everyone else crazy?  Am I 
lucky?  What is going on?
