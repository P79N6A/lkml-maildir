I am curious what is the minimum kernel source tree is
required to build external modules.
I dont want to touch my kernel , i want to make
another directory same 'module_test' and want to copy
only required minimum kernel Source tree with modified
scripts's Makefile and kbuild Makefile to build "Hello
World".
Please help me.
Thanks.
