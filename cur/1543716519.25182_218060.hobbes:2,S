Sure.  But lazy-readahead is bolted on the side and is generally not to my
liking.  I'd like to find a solution to the sysbench problem which also
solves the thing which lazy-readahead addressed.

I don't think it's that.  The app is doing well-aligned 16k reads and
writes.  If we get enough pagecache hits on the reads, readahead turns
itself off (fair enough) but fails to turn itself on again.
The readahead logic _should_ be able to adapt to the fixed-sized I/Os and
issue correct-sized reads immediately after each seek.  I _think_ this will
fix the problem which lazy-readahead addressed, but as usual we don't have
a rigorous description of that problem :(

Readahead has got too complex and is getting band-aidy.  I'd prefer to tear
it down and rethink things.
