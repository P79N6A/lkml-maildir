Subject: [PATCH] PCI should use bios if direct is not detected
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In 2.4.10 the pci subsystem stopped using the bios to access the PCI
config space when no direct method is detected even though it does
detect that it *can* use the bios leaving my machine PCI-less :-(.
This patch restores the older saner behavior and shouldn't affect any
working system.
