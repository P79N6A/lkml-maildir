Fact is, I can't reproduce this with stock 2.6.2. If this is only
reproducible in 2.6.2-mm1, then it must be some change in there. What is
occuring is a bus_for_each_dev() where the callback returns 1 so that
the caller can stop and process one device (outside of the
bus_for_each_dev() loop so as not to cause lockups). Then it starts
bus_for_each_dev() again using the last device processed as the starting
point.
