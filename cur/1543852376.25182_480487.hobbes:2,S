No. That was a bug at some point, but it's not that way now. See
	pci_access_init(void)
which checks the pci_direct_probe() first, and only _then_ calls 
pci_mmcfg_init(). And pci_mmcfg_init() will refuse to even use MMCONFIG 
unless either the direct probe failed _or_ the MMCONFIG area is marked 
entirely reserved in the e820 tables. Exactly because MMCONFIG generally 
doesn't _work_.
Now, if that is indeed broken, then yes, we need to fix it. 
Jeff - when you enable "direct PCI access", what is the printout? You 
should get
	PCI: Using configuration type 1
and the kernel should never have used MMCONFIG if the area wasn't marked 
as reserved in e820..
