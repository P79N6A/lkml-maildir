I can watch TV in xawtv using the coax or RCA connectors, however I cannot change channels --
I see error messages about VIDIOCSTUNER etc. The windows program "wincasttv" bundled with my
card can operate the tuner perfectly. Any help to get channel-changing to work properly with
Linux would be appreciated.
thanks
