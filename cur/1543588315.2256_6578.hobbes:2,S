Nope, the representation of the pgd/pmd/pte entries is entirely up to
you (us :).  The pmd entries for example are accessed through pmd_none,
pmd_present, pte_offset, etc., and are set with pmd_populate.  Those
functions are all defined in asm/pgtable.h and asm/pgalloc.c.  So you
can make the representation whatever you like as long as those
functions all do the right thing.  Same goes for the pgd and pte
levels.
Paul.
