Hi,
	Is it possible to tap a packet and send it to a userlevel program
before it is sent to appropriate receive function (say ip_rcv()). The
user level program will give the packet back to the kernel for delivery
to appropriate receive function.
	In short, is it possible to have a protocol stack (between layer 2 and
3) to be implemented in useland.
	Is Tun/Tap driver useful here?
Thanks for all the help
Manoj
