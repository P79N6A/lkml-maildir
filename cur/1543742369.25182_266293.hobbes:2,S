ok, i've uploaded -V0.5.12 which has this BKL trick. I hope i got the
ALSA ioctls right: the ones that go outside the BKL for now are the
pcm_native playback/capture ones, and rawmidi's ioctl. All the others
are still BKL users. To recap, it's these ioctls that matter:
 5971  ioctl(7, 0x4143, 0x446b7d3c)      = 0
 5971  ioctl(7, 0x4140, 0x446b7d3c)      = 0
 5971  ioctl(7, 0x4142, 0x446b7d3c)      = 0
which ones are these? Look at the patch for how to change a .ioctl one
to .ioctl_nobkl (lame solution ...). So if your setup uses any other
ioctl (sndctl perhaps?) then you should change that one to nobkl too.
