Ehh.. Not only does pwd not do that..

.. but even if it did that, it should use O_DIRECTORY when it did so. If 
it doesn't, it's broken.
So no, it would _not_ open the device or fifo when it did so.
The fact is, anything that expects to open a directory should already be 
opening it with O_DIRECTORY.
That said, ".." and "." are special already inside the kernel, and it 
migth be worth making them automatically imply O_DIRECTORY, since nothing 
else makes sense anyway. That would fix the case where somebody uses ".." 
_without_ using O_DIRECTORY.

I don't think you can do that. The kernel has no idea how to mount the
filesystem.
If it's already mounted somewhere else, that's a different issue.  
Although it might be mounted in several places (as a bind mount) with
different writability, I guess, so even then it might be "interesting".
