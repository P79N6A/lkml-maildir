What is this "net channels"?  I'll do some googling but if you have a 
direct reference it would be helpful.

Maybe you should try using a microkernel then like mach?  The Linux way 
of doing things is to leave critical services that most user mode code 
depends on, such as filesystems and the network stack, in the kernel.  I 
don't think that's going to change.

Have you taken a look at bsd's kqueue and NT's IO completion port 
approach?  They allow virtually all of the IO to be offloaded to 
hardware DMA, and there's no reason Linux can't do the same with aio and 
O_DIRECT.  There's no need completely throw out the stack and start 
over, let alone in user mode, to get there.

I agree, the old (non) blocking IO style interfaces have all sucked, 
which is why it's time to move on to aio.  NT has been demonstrating for 
10 years now ( that's how long ago I wrote an FTPd using IOCPs on NT ) 
the benefits of async IO.  It has been a long time coming, but once the 
Linux kernel is capable of zero copy aio, I will be quite happy.
