   Instead of this, Profibus uses an idle time of 33 bits to ensure
   unambiguous detection of frame boundaries. Therefore, I'd like to be
   able to find out from the hardware driver when such an idle period
   happens.
At what baud rates does Profibus run?  The problem is that you will need
to read a high-resolution clock at every interrupt, and this is (a) slow
or unavailable on some architectures, and (b) non-portable.
Some intelligent serial ports will simply not support this at all.
If Profibus has such a broken architecture, then it may not be possible
to support it using the generic serial driver.  And you may need to
support in such a way that it will only work on the i386 platform, or
some such.  It's not going to be pretty.....
