You can add more DEBUG options for spinlock and stack usage, disable
preempt and pray for a trace before the crash. If you do not have a
second host to add more traffic (wrt to bandwidth and/or pps), try to
dd your disk and/or your remote storage to /dev/null while watching TV.
You are out of luck if it does not crash more easily.
