Demand-paging the hugepages is a decent feature to have, and ISTR resisting
it before for this reason.
Even though it's early in the 2.6 series I'd be a bit worried about
breaking existing hugetlb users in this way.  Yes, the pages are
preallocated so it is unlikely that a working setup is suddenly going to
break.  Unless someone is using the return value from mmap to find out how
many pages they can get.
So ho-hum.  I think it needs to be back-compatible.  Could we add
MAP_NO_PREFAULT?
