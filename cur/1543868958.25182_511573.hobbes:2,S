Well certainly using the jsm driver (which is what I use for the pci
card I play with), doing cat to the port send data and cat from the port
receives, as long as both ports are set to the right baud rates and with
sensible stty settings.
Here are the stty settings I was using when cat worked fine:
speed 9600 baud; rows 0; columns 0; line = 0;
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;
eol2 = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R;
werase = ^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O; min = 1; time = 0;

You can read yours using 'stty -a -F /dev/serialdevice'.
Maybe you can find something that has to be changed to do raw reads.
Also make sure there are newlines in the stuff you send, otherwise cat
might not show it for a while, if at all since I think it tries to wait
for a newline before showing the line.
