Is that actually true?
Almost all LL/SC implementations have granularity rules, where "touch the 
location" is not a byte-granular thing, but actually ends up being 
something like "touch the same cachline".
They also often have _other_ rules like: "the cacheline has to stay in the 
L1 in exclusive state" etc. Which means that in a direct-mapped L1 cache, 
you can't even load anything that might be in the same way, because it 
would cause a cache eviction that invalidates the SC.
It's possible that ARM has really strong LL/SC, but quite frankly, that 
sounds unlikely. I've never heard of anybody ever _architecturally_ saying 
that they support that strong requirements, even if certain micro- 
architectures might actually support stronger semantics than the ones 
guaranteed by the architectural rules.
