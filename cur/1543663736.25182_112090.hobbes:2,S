This is called SFQ, or CFQ with 0 dispatch queue level and it works
fine (given a fixed amount of tasks doing I/O). You still don't
understand you don't care about throughput and seeks if you only need to
read 1 block with the max fairness and you don't mind to read another
block within 1 second. seeking is the last problem here, waiting more
than 1 second is the only problem here.
