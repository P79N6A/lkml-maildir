Yes, I like coroutines :) even if sometimes you have to be carefull with
the stack usage ( at least if you do not want to waste all your memory ).
Since there're N coroutines/stacks for N connections even 4Kb does mean
something when N is about 100000. The other solution is a state machine,
cheaper about memory, a little bit more complex about coding. Coroutines
though helps a graceful migration from a thread based application to a
multiplexed one. If you take a thread application and you code your
connect()/accept()/recv()/send() like the ones coded in the example http
server linked inside the epoll page, you can easily migrate a threaded app
by simply adding a distribution loop like :
for (;;) {
	get_events();
	for_each_fd
		call_coroutines_associated_with_ready_fd();
}
