I hate this.
First of all, I dare not code it. Linus seems to want Linux not
strongly tied to the POSIX thread model. We have non-POSIX thread
libraries, sorry if you don't like it.
Even with POSIX threads, I think we should leave implementation
choices like "N+1 or N or N:M or N:many" to the library author.
Second of all, as the author of the new "ps", I really want
non-POSIX thread systems to display as processes. It is not OK
to have, say, Java processes show up as a hundred distinct tasks.
(unless of course you ask for that:  -T -m m -L)

This isn't really going to work. You can't just distribute the
signals as they come in. Sometimes you must keep signals in a
common pool, then deliver to the first thread that unblocks.
(don't be adding anything _really_ gross to work around this)

No, kill() must return ESRCH when sent to a task that is not the
thread group leader.
