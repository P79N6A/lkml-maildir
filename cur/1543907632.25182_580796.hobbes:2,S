Hi,
I have tried the "slow down printk" , and I have two questions.
1. why it depends the DEBUG_KERNEL? Sometimes we only need boot_delay
to see the printk infomations.  How about set it as a standalone
config option?
2. In My system if I boot with boot_delay=200 the early part of
booting will be very slow, eapecially at the very beginning (after the
compressing  and start kernel, it nearly stop here many minutes).
And I wonder if we can simply use mdelay in the boot_delay_msec(). I
tested the mdelay , and the result is more accurate.
Regards
dave
