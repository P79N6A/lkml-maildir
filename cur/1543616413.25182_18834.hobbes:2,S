Every version I found was practically the same (only comment differences 
and one that variable that was initialized in one and not initialized in 
the other).  I think (actually, I know, because I have tested it) 
everyone can use the same one.  I'm not talking about the ones in the 
boot directories, nor the one for inflate_fs, either, just the ones in 
the kernel proper that are named zlib.c and zlib.h.

Why not just create zlib as a module if all the users are modules (so 
depmod and modprobe load it)?  That's what everything else does.  And 
that way, if it's already in the kernel, the module just won't get 
loaded, but if it's not the module gets loaded.  What you are suggesting 
seems rather convoluted.
I guess one other option would be to have an explicit user-set tristate 
like CONFIG_ZLIB, and if anything uses zlib, it could only be modules if 
CONFIG_ZLIB was a module, etc.

I already have patches to do all this, actually, I was just trying to 
get some feedback on it and see if the kernel maintainers would be 
interested in this.  I should have said that earlier.
