Subject: VM worse in 2.2.0-pre5/6 than in 2.1.132

The 2.2.0-pre* buffer cache is worse than the 2.1.132 implementation.
Doing a mke2fs on a 12G device, buffer cache eats up my main memory without
recognizing buffer_mem.max_percent as it did before.
The system (2*PII/350, 256M) is absolutly not interactive for at least a minute
friendly swaping at that time.
A look into the code fs/buffer.c showed refill_freelist() to be very
slim now ;*)
If i put in an artivicial limit for the buffercache, i run into
a MM deadlock, because the freeing code seems to be gone with
refill_freelist()'s emaciation and waking up bdflush is not very successfull
in this case.
BTW: a while ago in the 2.1.* time, buffer_mem.max_percent wasn't
     recognized either.
     But at that time refill_freelist() code was smart enough to refill
     with my artificial limit hack giving a much better interactive feeling.
Please bring us back the limited buffer cache with refilling of the feelist! 8*)
Any comments by the MM gurus?
Regards,
Heinz
