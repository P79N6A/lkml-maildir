Well, having worked in hardware design groups for many years, I can tell
you that hardware is not supposed to be damageable by software. The
definitive API is that which the HW *chooses* to export to the software
community. Ultimately this issue is for HW manufacturers to come to
terms with. If consumer HW can be permanently damaged by software in the
field, then the HW is defective. Period. And just because there are bad
designs in the market--does not justify the notion that software
developers are responsible for the problem.
That said, if the kernel can cover for bad hardware without extracting a
performance penalty, then I think it is a viable issue to consider.
Otherwise inform all interested parties of the facts and let the market
forces decide the solution.
