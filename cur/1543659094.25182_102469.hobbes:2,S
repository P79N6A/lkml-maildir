  hoping i don't embarrass myself again ...
1) where is the USMDOS selection that's listed in the Kconfig file?
   it doesn't appear in the menu
2) shouldn't ext3 depend on ext2?
3) currently, since quotas are only supported for ext2, ext3 and
   reiserfs, shouldn't quotas depend on at least one of those
   being selected?
