Well, perhaps we have slightly different agendas.  I think driverfs will solve 
a whole series of enumeration and mapping problems that occur in the SCSI 
mid-layer and which get especially tortuous with Fibre Channel.  I also think 
it will help us bring the SCSI and IDE views closer together.
I persuaded Linus to put the SCSI driverfs patches in the kernel even though I 
knew they touched more than SCSI (the partitions code) and were not as modular 
as I would have liked.  The reason is that we need to get as much visibility 
on this as possible before the code freeze.  I'm fully prepared to sort out 
any problems with this as they arise (and indeed the panic is already fixed).
I believe it's a variation of a principle attributable to a wise Australian:  
get the right solution in, even if not quite the right implementation.  That 
way, everyone will be extrememly motivated to help produce the right 
implementation.
