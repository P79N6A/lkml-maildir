Just a couple of points:
- This makes sense for _one_ user machines _only_. For multiuser machines,
  you have something better for the CPU to do than to compress/decompress
  pages for swapping
- As you say, most Linux users (even personal machines) don't use swap very
  much, they have got the RAM
- With today's RAM and disk prices, the diskless machines that used to swap
  over the net are long gone history
