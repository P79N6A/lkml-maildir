Whomever packaged up your gcc release obviously didn't put the documentation
into /usr/doc/egcs-*.  You might want to complain to them about this.  To
figure out the options GCC supports, use the info command, and then do:
	mgcc
	mInvoking GCC
	1
for a summary.  Needless to say, GCC supports very many options.  For straight
GCC, any -O level above -O3 is the same as -O3, but the pgcc varient added more
layers.  As long as you don't use -march=i686, the compiler won't generate the
cmov and fcmov instructions that the Pentium and K6 don't support (the compiler
doesn't generate the bswap or 8 byte locking instructions in any case).
