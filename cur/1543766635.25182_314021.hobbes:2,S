Actuallky, no it isn't.   All these transports would work just fine with
the mmap a character device to hand out memory from the kernel approach
I told you to use multiple times and Andrew mentioned in this thread aswell.
What doesn't work with that design are the braindead designed by comittee
APIs in the RDMA world - but I don't think we should care about them too
much.
