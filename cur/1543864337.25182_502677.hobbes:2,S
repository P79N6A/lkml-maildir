Hi Soeren,
I would probably not call this a regression, as this has been always 
there, as far as I can see.

Changing module parameter values through sysfs is not a very nice idea, 
because the change of the value is indeed silent - the driver is not 
notified in any way, that the value has changed. So the driver should take 
care of it by itself, which is not a nice thing.
The fact that during suspend/resume cycle it works is caused by the fact 
that all the hid devices are reinitialized, and therefore the 
hid->pb_fnmode is reassigned a new value, which has eventually been 
changed through sysfs.
I would rather be inclined to just make the 
/sys/module/usbhid/parameters/pb_fnmode read-only (which is what most of 
the drivers do anyway), to avoid this kind of confusion.
Do you have really any strong use-case, when setting the parameter during 
runtime would be much more useful than just do it during modprobe or 
rmmod/modprobe cycle?
Thanks,
