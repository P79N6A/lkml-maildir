What should happen ideally and I didnt have the hw to check is that
we take whatever baud rate the use requested (arbitary value). From that
we compute the best divider. From the best divider we compute the actual
speed. The actual speed is then written back into the termios structure.
(The kernel knows about a few percent off being ok and will report
appropriately in those cases)
