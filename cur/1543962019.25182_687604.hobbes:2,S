100% ACK to "Raise the quality" (no matter whether it influences the volume).

One big problem I see is Linus wanting to merge all drivers regardless 
of the quality.
Linus said in [1]:
"I'd really rather have the driver merged, and then *other* people can 
 send patches!"
The problem is that such "other people" do not exist (except perhaps Al) 
for non-trivial stuff.
My favorite gem from this driver we merged in 2.6.25 is:
  grep -C4 volatile drivers/infiniband/hw/nes/nes_nic.c
Fixing such stuff aren't "janitorial kind of things", and people are 
actually more motivated to fix their code for getting it into the kernel 
than to fix their code after it went into the kernel.
I am not saying we shouldn't merge such a driver at all or set 
unrealistic high quality goals - I'm for merging all code of good 
quality that provides functionality not yet into the kernel.
But we need some minimum quality level.
