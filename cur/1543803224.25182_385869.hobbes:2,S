Correct, with all pairs crossed.
I don't force-death but I think most gigabit cards (and some 100BaseTX)
work with plain cable as well (using auto MDI-X, and auto-polarity
if needed).

Again, I don't know nforce, but normal cards with autonegotiation
(i.e., (almost?) all 100BaseTX and newer) can negotiate speed and
duplex without need for a switch. BTW from net POI switches and
cards are DTEs, there is no special distinction WRT autonegotiation.
