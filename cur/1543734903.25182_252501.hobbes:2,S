I've beeing doing a lot experiments, the trial-and-error way, by tweaking
kernel config options on and off, and (re)building the
linux-2.6.9-rc1-bk12-S0 SMP kernel.
I have some news indeed. As you may recall, I'm trying to run jackd
realtime low-latency audio on a P4 2.80C HT (Hyperthreading), and I keep
CONFIG_SMP=y always set.
I found, almost by mistake, that whether CONFIG_SCHED_SMT is set makes a
lot of difference.
a) With CONFIG_SCHED_SMT=y, which I've being doing since ever, the system
behavior is that same one I've been complaining about: having
softirq-preempt=0 and hardirq-preempt=0 is the minimal setting to run
jackd in realtime mode without hard-locking the whole system. Even then, I
get the system completely frozen more times than I like, almost twice a
day! Can't figure out who's or what's the culprit here. It's quite random.
b) When CONFIG_SCHED_SMT is not set, I can run all along with
softirq-preempt=1, hardirq-preempt=1 et al. While running jackd in
realtime mode, I get NO hard-locks, but unfortunately XRUNs are plenty. A
real storm. However I've noticed that the whole seems pretty much stable,
as I didn't experience one single system hang. Regression to
softirq-preempt=0 and hardirq-preempt=0 dissolves the xrun storm to
nothing again.
All my experiments were done based on starting jackd -R -p 128 -n 2 ...
using an onboard Intel ICH5 soundcrap driven by snd-intel8x0 (alsa). Oh, I
forgot to say that it's been always with kernel-preempt=1 and
voluntary-preempt=1.
I'm preparing to take some latency traces later on, while regarding the
SMP=1 SMT=0 configuration and softirq=1 hardirq=1 setting, in a effort to
let that horrible XRUN flux getting out of the way somehow, someday ;)
So, bottomline is that the SMT-aware scheduler is not ready for VP, isn't
it? Does anyone care to confirm this out?
Cheers.
