Hmm . . . we already depend on the register/unregister functions in 
sched.c, so my patch changes the oprofile Kconfig to default to 'm' and 
'depends on SPU_FS'.

Yes, I was thnking along the lines of your last suggestion.  I presume 
OProfile gets notified (object_id == 0) before the context is actually 
destroyed.  At that time, we would NULL-out the reference to the 
cached_info, so then SPUFS would kfree it at destroy time.
