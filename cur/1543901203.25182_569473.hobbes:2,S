This laptop's BIOS only offers "legacy support" enabled or disabled,
both of which lead to frozen kernel. I will investigate whether the GIT
tree freezes at the same point.

It does the same thing, git5, that is. Sorry I took so long, but I didnt
get to testing this earlier.
It is just odd that up to (not including) the 2.6.21-series every kernel
boots, and after that, they just freeze.
I am kinda stumped here.
