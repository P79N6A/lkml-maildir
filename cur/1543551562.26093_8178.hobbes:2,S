Yes that's the start.
I have to study loop.c more intensivly, because I think
I found at least two more trap doors. 
(It's amazing that it works at all :-) )
Look at the line
if (size > len) 
    size = len
This seems to be horrible wrong... A CBC chain always has
to decrypt/encrypt a whole block otherwise the data my
be irrecoverable. (With the sector approach it works, because
len is sectors << 9 ...)
And also
    block = current_request->sector / (blksize >> 9);
    offset = (current_request->sector % (blksize >> 9)) << 9;
The whole operation will go wrong if offset != 0 .
so long
