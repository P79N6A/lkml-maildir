Subject: !CONFIG_MMU stubs in 2.5.66

The following change in 2.5.66:
   [PATCH] a few missing stubs for !CONFIG_MMU
   Patch from Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
   This is from the uClinux patches - there are a few more stubs needed
   in nommu.c to get the mmuless plattforms working.
Adds definitions for vmalloc_to_page, follow_page, and remap_page_range,
to mm/mmnommu.c.  However, there are already inline definitions of those
functions (predicated on !CONFIG_MMU) in linux/mm.h, so compilation
fails.
Which is the correct location?
[I locally removed the defs in linux/mm.h to get things to compile]
Thanks,
-Miles
