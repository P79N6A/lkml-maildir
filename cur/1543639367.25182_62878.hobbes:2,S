You are right that as long as the pages are in large page pool they are not
available for other regualr purposes.  Though the current implementation
basically allows on-demand moving of pages between large_page and other
regular pools using sysctl interface.   The issue is really not forced (in
the sense that large pages are freed only if they are available and vice
versa).  And it will not be an issue where demand for large pages is low.
Theoritically you can extend this support in pageout daemon to find out if
it can retrieve some free large pages (for environments where expectations
are that most of the memory will be used for large pages but actual usage is
not as per the expectations. Though I doubt if those environments will
occur, but bad configurations are always there)  The current approach really
allows the large page/regular_page movement without doing too much of house
cleaning.  It is likely that once a large page goes back to general pool, it
will not easy to replenish the large_page pool because of fragmentation in
regular memory pool (for memory starved machines.  For the scenarios where
sometime the machine is running low on regular memory and sometimes on
large_pages....probably it would be a good idea to add in more RAM in these
cases.).
