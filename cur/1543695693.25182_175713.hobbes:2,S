Sure, but if you have a kernel which supports arbitraty extended
attributes for files you don't need much more kernel support. You
can implement things like metadata for files and query languages on
top of that in userspace. If you modify applications to (also) put some
metadata (meta tags from html pages, document properties from office
documents, etc.) in those extended attributes you might already be where
microsoft is going.
You only would need some kernel interaction if you want to keep an
updated index of file contents (dnotify for a while filesystem and
reindexing whole files instead of blocks doesn't sound very attractive).
