In my opinion the "if (offset < 0)" check above is not needed once the
problem you describe is fixed, since the code below actually expects
that offset can be negative and doesn't do anything in that case.
Thinking more about it, the
	if ((((tsc - vxtime.last_tsc) * vxtime.tsc_quot) >> 32) < offset)
statement is comparing unsigned and signed values, and should probably
be fixed to do a signed comparison.
