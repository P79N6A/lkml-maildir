I'm back. First of all I beg your pardon for blaming 2.6.14.2, I forgot I 
rebooted with 2.6.13.4.
A cursory check of the mailing list and the changelog doesn't show any obvious 
change in 2.6.14 that would solve this, but I may be overlooking something.
Anyway I couldn't reproduce the bug in 2.6.14.2, but it is easily reproducible 
with 2.6.13.4. Adding and removing a 8139too PCMCIA card I managed to get this 
warning:
find: WARNING: Hard link count (5) is wrong for /proc/bus/pci: this may be a 
bug in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf 
option.  Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should 
have been searched.
Compiling pcmcia in the kernel (but leaving yenta and 8139too as a module) I 
never get errors on /proc/bus, but I get the same results on /proc/bus/pci.
It seems a broader hotplug problem. Of corse it could be already solved in 
2.6.14, as I can't reproduce it.
