During a badblocks scan of a Seagate 1239NS (200MB) SCSI harddisk sitting on
an AHA1542B adapter I got a number of these:
aha1542.c: Trying device reset for target 0
And then finally this:
Kernel panic: unable to find empty mailbox for aha1542.
As the disk is getting old it may have had a number of bad blocks on it, but
I would prefer if I didn't have to reset the whole system just because of that.
/proc/scsi/scsi gives the following about my SCSI devices, if it matters:
Attached devices: 
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: CDC      Model: ST1239NS         Rev: 9212
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 01 CCS
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 05 Lun: 00
  Vendor: UMAX     Model: Astra 1220S      Rev: V1.2
  Type:   Scanner                          ANSI SCSI revision: 02
/proc/scsi/aha1542/0 doesn't have anything about the adapter, but during bootup
it says that the BIOS is version 3.10.
Looking through the code in aha1542.c I found many comments about trouble with
resetting the bus, devices and the host, so it looks like an area that might
need some attention :-)
As I have a[n older] version of the adapter and what looks like a good testbed
for problems (an old disk with bad blocks) I would like to look into this. I do
however, not have the jumper-settings sheet anymore (lost between 1992 and now)
so I am not really aware of the settings. So if someone would let me know I 
would appreciate it. Any other information about the adapter would be useful
as well, so if you have that or pointers to where I can get it, please let me
know.
Any suggestions from any of you guys would probably be helpful, eg. "try this"
or "don't do that". For a starter, I would like to know what all this about
mailboxes is about, as it is all over the code in aha1542.c ?
Thanks and have a nice New Year,
Peter
