Since nobody answered, I suppose that at least I did not miss something
obvious. Si I tried to write it.
What I understoud is that the way to access the byte at physical address
a is to kmap(mem_map[o >> PAGE_SHIFT]), and access at offet
o % PAGE_SHIFT (and then kunmap it). Perharps it is very ix86-centered.
Since it did not crash my PC, and it gave the same data as /dev/mem, I
think I was not totally wrong.
The code is available at <URL:

part is not yet done, but since it is very similar to read, it should be
really straightforward. Nevertheless I will wait a bit before trying it.
