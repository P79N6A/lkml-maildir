I will check the oe: on my machine at home, I can't test my work machine
because my batteries are running low on my palm.
I only connect at 57600.  Both machines have problem with sound skipping,
the home machine much more so, when there is disk activity, or while
changing desktops in X.
I will see if I can turn up more info on my situation.
