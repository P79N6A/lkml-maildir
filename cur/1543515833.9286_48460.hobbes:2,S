Actually there is one:  new system calls are _ALWAYS_ appended at the end,
unless they had a fixed value reserved earlier in the development cycle.
Everything else kills backward compatibility for static binaries (failing
because a legacy syscall is no longer provided is preferred over executing
a random _WRONG_ call!).
BTW. Don't be so focused on the number 256: Linux/Alpha for example has over
300 due to support for OSF syscalls (IMHO a design bug: should have used
personalities for this, but maybe i am mistake and this is the only way to
do this...)
