Here is where we disagree. In my opinion, no matter what the sign of
char for given architecture is, it's incorrect to pass either "signed
char*" or "unsigned char*" argument to a function expecting "char*".

There should be warning, -- that's my point. "char" is different. "char"
is distinct from either "signed char" or "unsigned char". Always. At
least it's how C is defined.

I already gave an answer in response to Linus:
static inline size_t ustrlen(const unsigned char *s)
{
    return strlen((const char *)s);
}
