No really good reason.
I think I felt that macros would be very noisy for relatively little
gain.
However I guess
#define ST 1  /* status*/
#define FH 17 /* filehandle with length */
#define AT 22 /* attributes */
#define WC 7  /* WCC attribute prefix */
might make things clearer without being too noisy....
