There is an inode leak in lockd, caused by a reference counting bug.
It will appear when you use DOS/Windows clients to access a knfsd+lockd
based NFS server, and it will crash the server sooner or later (a DOS
attack, literally ;).  The lockd bug is still alive in 2.4.0-test?,
so upgrading doesn't help either.
I'll attach my patch for 2.2.16.  It should apply to 2.4.0-test? too,
with one or two lines of fuzz maybe.
Ciao,
