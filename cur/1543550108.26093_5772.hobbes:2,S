Agreed.

shm is not used as I/O cache from 90% of the apps out there because normal apps
uses the OS cache functionality (90% of those apps doesn't use rawio to share a
black box that looks like a scsi disk via SCSI bus connected to other hosts as
well).
I for sure agree shm swapin/swapout is very important. (we moved shm
swapout/swapin to swap cache with readaround for that reason)
