I had a long long dig back through my mail archive in search of
RLIMIT_RSS. The original mm for Linux didn't enforce it as it did not
have any way to track RSS that was not computationally expensive. The
current mm is probably capable of implementing RSS limits although
questions then still remain about what effect this has if a user sets a
low RSS limit and then causes a lot of swap thrashing. 
If you can see a way to implement it efficiently then go for it.
