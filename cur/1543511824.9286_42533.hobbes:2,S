That is not the default, and is not quite correct. There is a configuration
where /devices (or wherever, maybe somewhere only readable by root) is the
devfs, and devfsd populates /dev with the correct nodes/links. And, as you
know, when you chown/chmod a link, the target (or the target of the target,
etc) gets the requested action. devfsd then adds persistance to whereever
the devfs is mounted, thereby carrying it over to /dev which devfsd is
populating.

See above.

Again, the only permissions that matter are those kept track of by devfsd on
the devfs mount.
