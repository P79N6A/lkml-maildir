Yes, for example the pm counter is 24 bits.  A lot of platforms have 32 bit 
counters...

Lets assume the pm counter which has 24 bits.  This means your shift is 40 bits. 
  In "s->multiply = (NSEC_PER_SEC << s->shift) / freq;" you will have an overflow.
Here you need to keep (NSEC_PER_SEC << s->shift) in 64 bits AND multiply must 
also be 32 bits or less.  I really don't think you can choose the scale so easily.

Right, I miss read the function.  cycles() should be now() if I am reading this 
right.

I really think a tickless system, for other than UML systems, is a loosing 
thing.  The accounting overhead on context switch (which increases as the number 
of switchs per second) will cause more overhead than a periodic accounting tick 
once a respectable load appears.  The periodic accounting tick has a flat 
overhead that does not depend on load.

I am not sure that is the right thing to do here.  For example, on SMP systems 
today we have a timer event interrupt per cpu.  This is much more scaleable and 
not so easy to do if we tie it to the time source.  All we need is a reasonably 
accurate short term counter.
