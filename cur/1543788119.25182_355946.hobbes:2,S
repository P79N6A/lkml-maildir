But we should, right?  It seems like a child device should never be in a
higher suspend state than its parents.  The rule doesn't have to hold with
driver-initiated runtime power management, but when the user requests a
suspend via power/state, it's reasonable to assume every child should
be suspended first.

So...
1.) suspend all child devices
2.) calculate their wake requirements
3.) suspend the parent to a degree compatible with those requirements
Right?
