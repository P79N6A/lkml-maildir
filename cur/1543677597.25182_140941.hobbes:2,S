I agree.  The problem here is that the sysfs/driver-model core is putting
an object into a structure (i.e., a pointer to the device_attribute
structure is being stored in the dentry for a user-owned file) without
taking the corresponding responsibility for the lifetime of the driver
code that the attribute refers to.  The struct driver's reference count is 
_not_ incremented; in fact device_create_file() doesn't even _have_ a 
struct driver argument to say who the caller is.
You could make a good case that this ought to be fixed by changing either
the sysfs or the driver model code.  But in either case, the fault lies in
the core implementation, not in the driver.

Of course.
