I'd prefer (especially since I'm on the CC line ;) that you send out the
[0/22] mail, and send all the rest of the mails (the actual patches) as
replies to that first mail.  That way, at least all of the emails are in
the same thread and can easily be collapsed/expanded.  I know when I
checked my mail monday morning and there were all those individual
mails, I thought I'd broken something and people were out for my blood!
