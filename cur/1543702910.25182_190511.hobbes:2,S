Hello,
I'm using the x86_64 architecture branch and have simply copied the 
kernel into my configuration of a 2.4.21 kernel.
I have the following lines in /etc/modules.conf:
alias eth0 r8169
alias snd-card-0 snd-via82xx
With the 2.4.21 kernel everything worked fine, with the 2.6.1 kernel I 
get the following behavior:
modprobe eth0
(no error, but r8169 not loaded)
modprobe r8169
(module r8169 is loaded and works)
modprobe snd-card-0
(FATAL: Modul snd_card_0 not found)
modprobe snd-via82xx
(module snd-via82xx is loaded and works)
I'm not really a kernel expert and so I have to ask:
Am I right, that this could be a problem of the kernel?
Is this the wildcard problem that was fixed in mm1?
Should I try mm1 or where should I begin to search for the problem?
