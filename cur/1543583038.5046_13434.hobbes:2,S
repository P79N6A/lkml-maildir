I have server:/home mounted on /home, the directory /home/david is the
mount file/directory on that mount that has a stale handle, everything
else on that mount point works including accessing any file under
/home/david.
I mounted it on a different directory and the new mount was fine, and
the problem directory on the new mount was fine, but the problem
directory on the old mount was still stale.
Yes it is a ext2 file system being exported.  It is using the kernel
nfs server.
