Exactly, this is the only weakness in the implementation. In 32 bits the
space for stamping an ID in user space that the kernel can resolve is
pretty limited to avoid PID reusage conflicts. As soon as I have some time
I want to try hashing something like an xPID with the task->pid and the
task->start_time, that should be pretty unique. In 64 bit arches that hash
should be almost unbreakable and collision chance so slim as to be negligible.
On 32 bits arches though (or on all) I want to add some more code to the
task ID code that checks if the task that was found shares any memory with
the calling task. If not, that would be a collision and would mean the owner
died previously. If yes, it could be deemed as a good positive [with still
an small chance of collision, but the hashing + this should make it truly 
slim already].
As well, increasing the PID-space/actual-number-of-running-tasks ratio should
improve it. Ingo, you wrote the PID allocator--increasing the PID max 
automatically means PIDs take more time to be reused or am I completely
wrong?
Final thing: when you cannot live with the slim chance of collision, you
can always flip a bit in the mutex ([pthread_mutexattr_setfast_np()] and
it will always go through the kernel. Total determinism, at the expense of
performance.
