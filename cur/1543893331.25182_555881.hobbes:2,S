That sounds nice maybe but it's actually simply false. Natural language 
abilities and computer language abilities are very much related.
You also seem to ignore the other point that you don't _want_ to have 
significant groups of people go off in different directions and not 
communicate other than by a few selected interpreters. Here, as in most 
situations, communication is something to promote, not something you want to 
make easier to avoid.
I see your linux-sh address which seems to point embedded-wise? Really need 
even better examples of significant groups of developers going off in 
different directions, not communicating and not doing Linux or themselves a 
favour?

And I suggest the first thing they learn about Linux is enough English. Many 
did.
