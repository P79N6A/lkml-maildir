I recently acquired an XFX nForce 630i based motherboard, and have been 
experiencing hard freezes from time to time that I originally had no 
idea why happened. With hard freeze I mean exactly that; no log messages 
that I know of (though there might be some I don't know of), picture and 
input frozen.
After a bit I tried the following 64-bit kernels and found the culprit:
2.6.18-6 (debian stable)
2.6.22-14 (ubuntu server)
2.6.24-2 (debian unstable)
All of them crash when transferring files over samba, a hard freeze 
requiring shutdown.
I added a PCI network card, and without changing anything else things 
now work fine. The faulting network card is detected as:

Is this a simple case of unsupported new hardware (atm all devices are 
listed as unknown with lspci, IDs pending according to the lspci page), 
or is there something more sinister afoot? If any more information is 
required (I'm sure there is), I will do my best to provide it with my 
limited Linux knowledge.

Christian
