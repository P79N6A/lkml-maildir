Cool, we have a winner.  With a few exceptions, everyone wants this one.
Other than free beer, it seems like the other topics are covered.
I'll try and get people aware of the topic, I'd like Paul M to be there
as well as Ted Tso, they both seem to have thought pretty hard about it.
Jeff Dike is another good candidate, the UML layer and this have some
good synergy.  Cort is actually coding stuff up to implement this, so
I'm going to twist Victor's arm to send him...
Let's make it a BOF, I'll talk long enough that people get the idea and 
then you can all play devil's advocate.  I'll send mail to Andrew.

We'll spill over into the evening if things get rolling (or even if they
don't).
Cheers,
