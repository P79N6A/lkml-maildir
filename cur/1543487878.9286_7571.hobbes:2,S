the trouble is, however, (AFAIunderstood it) that the drive can only tell
the kernel "hey, my media is out" and not "I am about to eject".
Subsequently, the kernel cannot shout "stop, I have to close files first" -
which would be necessary.
Can the kernel get 'eject media' requests if the drive is locked? then the
problem would be solved. I.e.
- user pushes button
- nothing happens first (logically)
- kernel/autofs/.. receives "oh, the user wants to change media"
- if no files are open "umount && eject"
Another thing that would be very nice is for the mounting process to be
activated on disk _change_ not on first access.
