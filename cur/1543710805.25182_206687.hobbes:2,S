[PATCH] I2C: fix Hangs with w83781d
Here is a patch for the w83781d driver that prevents register bits from
being arbitrary changed when we force temp2/3 to comparator mode. Keith
Duthie had been reporting various problems with that driver and finally
found that this arbitrary change was the cause of them. He also tested
this patch, which he confirmed to work.
