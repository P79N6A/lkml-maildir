	hi,
	this is very reproduceable:
	boot, raidstart, ctrl+alt+del, BOOM!
	2.2.13 with Ingo's raid patch, booted from initrd, very small
	kernel. the only special thing is the raid0 are hda & hdc 
	(no partition). i have other setups using partitions which work
	well.
	another problem: a machine running raid5 (from the same kernel 
	tree from above) from 4 nbd and a raid0 (sda + hda) lock hard.
	mkraid runs, but writing to the raid5 has put raid5syncd into 
	D state. tia for any help.
