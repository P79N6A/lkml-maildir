    I guess the question is: is there any point to have three forms --
    with necessary conversions between them -- or is it simpler to have
    two forms and just use the more awkward dev_t form everywhere?
It doesnt matter much. I would not have introduced kdev_t just
for slightly more efficient dev_t handling. But we have it already.
It seems meaningless to go and replace it by something more awkward
and less efficient.
[But should anyone want: globally s/kdev_t/dev_t/ and a small edit
of kdev_t.h suffices.]
    We do need a dev32_t for NFSv2 et al, though.
I don't know why.
