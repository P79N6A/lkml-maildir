I think the previous answer, some devices will read without pad and some
won't, is probably a good place to stop. It turns out that some device
not only don't need the pad, but will read it if you are in the raw read
mode, and thus "read more than you wrote" of data. For iso9660 images
being mounted the pad option should be used, and I believe that it does
in fact default to on in recent versions of cdrecord.
In any case I would add "with iso9660 images" to your fine advice, and
suggest that getting the iso filesystem size (from isoinfo) and reading
exactly that much is still probably desirable. There are too many TAO
vs. DAO and -pad or not magic solutions, unfortunately, and too much
dubious firmware for anything else to work every time.
