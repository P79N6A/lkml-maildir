Re-read Linus' original spec with the following things in mind:
- we don't interpose at the system call level, rather the kernel object level
- we tag about 8 objects
- we have about 150 callbacks
- we don't move the capabilities bits from the task struct to the opaque id
- we allow active filtering
- we discourage generic policy composition
- we support models such as MLS, TE, DTE, RBAC, Capabilities, PBAC/TBAC
  (whatver you want to call it), etc.
The fact that we don't support CAPP or LSPP standard compliant systems
which require MAC checks before DAC checks for _auditing_ is outside the
scope of this access control system.
thanks,
