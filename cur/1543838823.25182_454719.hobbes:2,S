This was discussed to death:
HAL using O_EXCL will randomly prevent burning/mounting/etc by causing a
race condition, so it can't do that. HAL not using O_EXCL will OTOH succeed
in opening despite of O_EXCL used by the burning process and thereby
prevent burning by opening a busy device. The proposed solution was
introducing O_NONE or O_HARMLESS to prevent side-effects from opening
the device.
This will, however, not prevent other users from maliciously destroying the
CD by not using O_EXCL. Chowning the device is not a real solution, since
users should be able to fusermount the CD.
Maybe it's possible to cache the result and thereby prevent repeated
opening from disturbing the burning process.
