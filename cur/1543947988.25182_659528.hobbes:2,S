I did and it seems to: just reverting
559bbe6cbd0d8c68d40076a5f7dc98e3bf5864b2 fixes resume for me.
635adc28087ced0c843d2ecb6d4ae474d0e611cd which is
559bbe6cbd0d8c68d40076a5f7dc98e3bf5864b2~1
also resumes fine.

As far as I can tell, nope, reverting
208c70a45624400fafd7511b96bc426bf01f8f5e fixes acpi
