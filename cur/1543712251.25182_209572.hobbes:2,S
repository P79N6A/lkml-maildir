We have an app that uses signals heavily (30K/sec at times).  When 
moving it from 2.4.18 to 2.4.22, we noticed a significant speed 
decrease, to the point where it is about 2.5 times slower on 2.4.22.
We're trying to figure out what is causing the problem, but I thought 
I'd see if anyone has any ideas off the top of their heads.
PowerPC hardware, 1 cpu, single-threaded app.
Thanks,
Chris
