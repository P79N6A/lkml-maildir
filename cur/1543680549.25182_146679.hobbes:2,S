It's true that that they are bugs, but on such widespread errors that
are transparently fixed by the kernel, do we really need to be reminded
every time such an event occurs?
$ grep unaligned /proc/cpuinfo 
kernel unaligned acc    : 0 (pc=0,va=0)
user unaligned acc      : 4400 (pc=30281c8c434,va=30281db8f62)
This machine has been up just a few hours, and already a has fixed a lot
of these errors. I really dont need the signal:noise ratio of my logs
diluted by this, unless im searching for bugs, which is why a sysctl
makes sense, imo.

True, and thats _really_ useful for turning the messages _on_ for the
application your working with/debugging/etc, system-wide messages just
dont make sense to me.
Also, it is optional, so only users who foresee wanting to disable the
messages will do so.
