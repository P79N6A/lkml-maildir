The file name is correct, and the comment is correct too.  It indeed
_allows_ to define architecture-independent operations on atomic types,
and it currently does so for atomic_long_t.  There is no need to do so
for atomic_t, because all architectures already had their own set of
atomic_t operations when asm-generic/atomic.h was added.  (And I presume
they varied too much to justify an additional generic implementation
plus #ifndef HAVE_ARCH_SOMETHING games.)
PS:  The atomic_long_t operations currently don't need to be protected
by #ifndef HAVE_ARCH_SOMETHING and won't need to be in foreseeable
future, therefore they don't have this protection.
