Linux does not directly use the ESCD, but it uses configuration coming
from the BIOS (like PCI bridge setup or ACPI resources) that might
depend on the ESCD depending on your BIOS implementation.
You would probably need to ask someone familiar with your BIOS what
the ESCD influences in your configuration and what Manual allocation
changes exactly.
Most likely the real fix would be to add a checksum to it, but 
only the BIOS can do that.
