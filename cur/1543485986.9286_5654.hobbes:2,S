The patch I sent yesterday is not enough (I thought it was bogus also
yesterday at first, then I had not time to think a lot about it and then
for some unknown reason I thought it was enough). (it would be enough if
all networking hardware would be not irq driven)
It's obviously not enough since synchronize_bh() is a nono called from an
irq handler (and shaper_kick() is going to be recalled from an irq
handler). 
I developed a new patch that I sent to Alex now for testing. The new patch
also get rid of _all_ cli(). I'll forward the new patch to list if it will
work OK. Unfortuantely today it's a not-kernel day since I'll have a hard
oral math exam tomorrow and I have to study Analysis II _boring_ theory
now ;).
