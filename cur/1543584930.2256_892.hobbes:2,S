Subject: [PATCH] fix a bug in ioctl(CDROMREADAUDIO) in cdrom.c in 2.2.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Using ioctl(CDROMREADAUDIO) with nframes argument being larger than 8 and
not divisible by 8 causes kernel to read and return more audio data than
was requested. This is bad since it clobbers up processes memory
(I noticed this when my patched cdparanoia segfaulted).
This _might_ also have a security impact, since it could be used to
overwrite memory which the user should not have write access with
cdrom audio data. (_might_ since I do not know the exact semantics of
__copy_to_user() and I am too lazy to check them out. The attacker needs
access to cdrom device with audio cdrom in drive, preferably with a
custom made audio cd).
I have not checked if the same bug is also present in 2.4 kernels.
If you have any comments, please Cc: them to me, since I am not present in
the list.
Here is a trivial patch against drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c of kernel 2.2.18:
