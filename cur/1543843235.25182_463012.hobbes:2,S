Let me repeat it : git-tar-tree can use a umask to set something different.

The real problem IMHO is that many people got used for 10 years to receive
kernels packaged by user 'linus' with perms 0644, and suddenly their
(discutable) habits are considerably upset because of what initially was
a limitation in the tool, which was argumented as a feature and might not
change anytime now.
Moral of the story : do not ever try to convince Linus he's wrong
when you disagree with him, because the argument he will give you
will quickly become desired features :-)
