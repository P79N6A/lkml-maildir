Just hint. I remember the time when "memory" clobber option
was _absent_ in gcc. And we managed to compile kernel with such gcc. 8)
To all that I understand, "asm" (like function calls) implied barrier
that time and constraints and clobber option were used only for
register allocation and reloading.

BTW Look also into asm-i386/bitops.h and dummy cast to some crap there.
Are you impressed? 8)
