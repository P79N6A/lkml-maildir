Nice idea, but I still think it is of interrest on what hardware
was it tested. Maybe also 'dmesg' output would help a bit, but
I still don't know how you'd find that I have _this_ motherboard
instead of another.
Second, I'd submit sometimes 2 or even 3 tested hosts. But am
willing to use only single email, though. ;)
I think we'd need some sort of profile, the profile would contain
some HW info, like motherboard type, bios version etc. To extract
that from 'dmesg' would be a nightmare I think.

Well, my case too. ;)
