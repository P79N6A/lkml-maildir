oh, that merge was certainly my suggestion from the very beginning of 
this "discussion". And no, LTT has no kprobe capabilities at the moment, 
it is a pure static tracer, but i'm still hoping that Karim stops doing 
this what i believe to be a pointless Don Quijote fight (which i believe 
keeps Mathieu from making the right technical decision), and lets LTT 
adopt to the times and integrate SystemTap. But hey, it's really his 
problem and not mine in the first place. I certainly have my share of 
fun and i even get to write code :)
