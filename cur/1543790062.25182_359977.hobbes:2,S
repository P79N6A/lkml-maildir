Then round it on 32MiB boundary? 128MiB boundary?
I did something else that "needed" the size of the memory installed
and that's how I did.
( I have an install script which I run at the end of an installation
  of a system that does a lot of stuff the distro doesn't and one
  of the things it does is simply to take the size of the memory
  rounded up, multiply by 2 and then create a swapfile in a specified
  location. )
