Thank you.  Over time we might think about some sort of standard for
these.

What's it worth to you?  :-)

This is one of the things that linux-next will hopefully let us discover
more easily/faster.

Right. Except that "drop the tree" will probably only mean for a day or
so i.e. it will be taken out of the current round but will reappear
automatically when the conflict/dependency is sorted out.

Excellent!
However, I am hoping that these global api changes may be introduced in a
more orderly fashion (some of which is happening already) by creating new
api's and then switching to them (and them maybe changing the names back
if necessary).  And, yes, I realise that this is sometimes not possible
(or at least not worth the extra effort).

Thanks, I will probably need it :-(
