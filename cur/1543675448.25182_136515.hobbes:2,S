I'm under the impression that LTP and other test efforts seemed to focus 
more on functional evaluation, which is fine.  We are trying to focus 
purely on the performance differences seen from day to day.

Your correct. We're just getting started with this effort and we used 
this mix to get things going. Once ppl are happy with the presentation 
of data, we planned to add more tests to provide a more balanced mix. 
But since you asked, we have added lmbench to our -bk3 regression run. :)
