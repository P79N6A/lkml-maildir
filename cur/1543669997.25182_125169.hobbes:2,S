Another FIXME patch:
It's a bit of an open question as to how much of a difference this one
makes now, but it says "FIXME". fault_in_pages_writeable() and 
fault_in_pages_readable() have a limited "range" with respect to the
size of the region they can prefault; as they are now, they are only
meant to handle spanning a page boundary. This converts them to iterate
over the virtual address range specified and so touch each virtual page
within it once as specified. As per the comment within the "FIXME",
this is only an issue if PAGE_SIZE < PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.
