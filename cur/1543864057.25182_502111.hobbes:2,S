PS: AFAIU what I'm doing here, it affects
  - bus resets triggered by local software (the bug report was also
    about externally triggered bus resets),
  - and potentially bus resets (even externally triggered ones) on SMP
    systems with (PCI) bridges if the IRQ handler migrates to a another
    CPU between two interrupt events in quick succession.
Can the latter happen in Linux or/and with -rt kernels?
