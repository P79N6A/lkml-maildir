Uh.  Don't do that.  You MUST call register_netdevice with rtnl_lock
held.

module_exit does not run inside rtnl_lock.
Theoretically, if you call unregister_netdev from rmmon, it should grab
rtnl_lock and then complete the operation for you.  If that doesn't work
for you, it sounds like you are not setting up, or cleaning up,
something correctly.
Basically... it sounds like there are still bugs in your driver that
need working out :)
