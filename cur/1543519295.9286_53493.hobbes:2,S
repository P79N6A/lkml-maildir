I upgraded to 2.2.14pre13 and error of irq timeout got
more frequent and severe.
My /var/log/messages is filled with the message as follows:
(I install linux on /dev/hdb)
	Dec 15 11:55:07 alfonz kernel: hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
When the error happens no disk access is possible.
When I used pre11, it could be decreased by setting
	hdparm -X65 /dev/hdb
But now I must set -X12 to make it stable.
The resoult of hdparm -t decreased from about 7.5M/sec
to about 5.8M/sec.
Hardware environment is,
M/B		GA-586S2(SiS5582)
/dev/hda	Maxtor 84320D4 (Windows 95)
/dev/hdb	Maxtor 92040U6 (Linux)
I remember pre9 or older versions has no such problem.
