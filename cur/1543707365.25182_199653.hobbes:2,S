So you have a packetshaper then?  By this I mean a PacketShaper from
packeteer (

).

I can't see how, but I don't know your setup and/or config. to
determine what the packet path is.
If there is a PacketShaper near the machine, I'm going to suggest
taking that away and see if this message goes away.  If it's upstream
of course you can't do this.
