Because migration can be used for more than one purpose.  One such
purpose is load-balancing large numbers of jobs.  If you have large
numbers of jobs, you do not want the resource overhead of a full OS for
each migrateable job.
The reason it is deemed simpler at the vm level, as you point out, is
that resources are naturally isolated.  The same work which will prepare
the kernel for vserver/openvz functionality will isolate kernel resources
between vserver/containers, making c/r and migration at that level level
much simpler.
