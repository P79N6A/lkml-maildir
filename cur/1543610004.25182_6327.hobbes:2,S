The mconfig release 0.20 is now available.
Mconfig is a tool to configure the linux kernel, similar to
make {menu,x,}config, but written in C and with a proper yacc
parser.
The following changes have been made since the last public
release, 0.18 by Michael Elizabeth Chastain:
* switched to autoconf/automake.
* build 'menu' mode only if curses are available.
* added manpage (VERY simple).
* added specfile for RPM builds.
* help text moved from C source to external file.
* modes 'text' and 'old' implemented.
* verb 'dep_mbool' implemented.
* relaxed error checking - moan in
This release is available as gzip/bzip compressed source tarball at:
