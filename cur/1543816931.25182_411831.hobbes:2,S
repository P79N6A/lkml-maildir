I meant that it doesn't explicitly address your problem.  What it does 
is ASSUME that failure of load balancing to move tasks is because there 
was exactly one task on the source run queue and that this makes it a 
suitable candidate to have that single task moved elsewhere in the blind 
hope that it may fix an HT/MC imbalance that may or may not exist.  In 
my mind this is very close to random.  Also back to front and inefficient.

This is a variation of the problem that active_load_balance() is being 
used as a random fix for.  I.e. it's HT/MC specific and should 
eventually be fixed in HT/MC specific code.  As I've said several times 
the mechanism for triggering active_load_balance() to try and achieve 
your aims is essentially random and it's a matter of luck whether it 
works or not (even without smpnice patches).  The smpnice patch probably 
reduces the odds that it will work but that's not their problem.  The 
unique load balancing needs of HT/MC need to be handled more 
deterministically.

I'm in the process of doing that.
