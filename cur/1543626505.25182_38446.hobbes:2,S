Not quite. They cover different things. The queue_lock originally covered the
queue and the request sending function. There was an obscure deadlock which
could occur in this case hence the split to a spin lock to cover the queue
and a semaphore to cover only the request sending function (hence tx_lock
rather than queue lock).
I've got a 2.5 version of that patch on my patches page at the moment, but
due to the block layer changes (if I've understood them correctly) the
fix should be done in a slightly different way. The reason that I've not 
submitted the patch for 2.5 is that it doesn't yet work and I've not had
a chance to investigate properly yet (it hangs on writes sometimes). I'm
sure its probably something silly that I've done but I just don't see it
at the moment. Any hints or clues are welcome :-)
Steve.
