I'm not sure it's a reason for it to go in, but the truth is suspend2
does work in more cases, ime. uswsusp is alpha(?) swsusp doesn't work
(for me in most cases), suspend-to-ram doesn't work (probably even
less cases than swsusp), suspend2 works. It's working status for more
of the userbase should (hopefully) be a concideration.
