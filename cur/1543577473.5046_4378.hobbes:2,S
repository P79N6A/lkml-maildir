I recieved the following messages from the kernel yesterda morning.  It
doesn't appear that any running programs actually died, or ran out of
memory (128M physical/ 256M swap, only about 150M total or so in use when
I got back on the machine.
As a side note, during times of what I consider only moderate system
activity (burning a CD while xmms playing and doing stuff in netscape, for
example) I've had some system freezes.  While under X, everything freezes
solid, mouse pointer and all.  System is completely inaccessable.  After
about 2 minutes or so, everything begins responding again.
These problems began only when I moved to kernel 2.2.18.  I also have
Reiserfs 3.5.29 patched in, and in use.
System is a K6-2/450, 128MB ram, Matsonic 6120S motherboard, ALi chipset.
Just email me for any more details that are needed.
