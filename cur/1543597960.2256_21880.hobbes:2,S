Samium did not elaborate what he means under "loses the tty",
but perhaps I can report something related.
Sometimes (not very often), after I do "ssh somehost",
the resulting bash runs without a some controlling terminal
function. Running "cat" from that shell (on somehost)
yields a cat that cannot be interrupted with a signal
from keyboard. ^D works. "stty -a" shows isig set.
tty shows PTY slave correctly.
This is related to 2.4.7 and SMP, I think.
