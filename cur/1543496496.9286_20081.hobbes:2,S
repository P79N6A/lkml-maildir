   Right now the low bound is the RTO that is lowbound to 200msec
   itself. If you decrease the lowbound of the rto then also the ato
   will decrease.
And unless you come up with some clever idea, if you implement
decreasing the RTO lower bound you will crap out completely with all
BSD'like TCP stacks where this is the smallest resolution of their TCP
timers.  Read the commentary in tcp_input.c about "HZ/5" etc.
I cannot allow this to change in the standard kernel unless a
resolution to this issue is discovered.
