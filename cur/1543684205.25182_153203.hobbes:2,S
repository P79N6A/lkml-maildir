Random question:
Way back when I used union mount code (under OS/2) that would mount the first 
filesystem read-only, and allow you to cache changes to it in a second 
filesystem.  (So you could do a build of slightly self-modifying code, a lot 
like the Linux build in 2.4 was, against a read-only tree.) 
Would this be a good tool for that sort of application?  (There's all sorts of 
other "trial run" type applications; running stuff against database snapshots 
and then seeing what the deltas are, etc...)
