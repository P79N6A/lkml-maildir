Hmmm... Not sure if Jonathan's problem is the same that I am having. But
I seem to have fixed my problem by compiling ACPI support into the
kernel. I still don't know why it was crashing, but I don't really know
how to go about figuring it out either. So since the crash doesn't
appear anymore I will likely not pursue this any longer.
