I fear that there is still some miss-understanding. Jiffies are totally 
OK for me. I can use them without any conversion.
I'll try to formulate the problem with some other words:
I hope that there is is something like a "jiffie-counter" for the 
keyboard driver, that stores the actual jiffies value whenever a 
keyboard interrupt occurs.
I hope too, that there is a way to query that "jiffie-counter" from 
another kernel driver, so that I can write something like
mymouse_module.c
...
void mouse_event(){
    // get the current time in jiffies
    int now=jiffies;
    // get the jiffie value of the last kbd event
    int last_kbd_event= ????;  // ... but how to do that ...
    if ((now - last_kbd_event) > delay) {
	do_some_very_smart_things();
    }
   }
...
