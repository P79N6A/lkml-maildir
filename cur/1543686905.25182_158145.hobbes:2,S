First off you are best at rebuilding the kernel yourself. The options
you need are:
Processor type and features:
 --> High Memory Support --> 64 GB
 --> Symmetric multi-processing support.
If kernel building seems to be too risky for you then you need to
install:
rpm -ivh kernel-smp-2.4.18-3.i686.rpm 
This should give you the SMP support but I cannot say whether the entire
memory is going to be recognized. I guess both will but try.
