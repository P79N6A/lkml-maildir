Even sadder, there are many unix features which are underused and/or
abused. My personal peeves include infrequent use of mmap() and over
use of threads instead of processes.
Stevens does an admirable job of documenting advanced programming in
unix, but his book reads like a reference. It's a poor book to learn
how to exploit the unix feature set.
