   Looking at the dump, it seems that most arriving
   segments have the PSH bit set.
I know you said what is running on the receiver, but do
you have any clue what is running on the sender?  It looks
_really_ broken.
The transfer looks like a bulk one but every segment (as you have
stated) has PSH set, which is completely stupid.
At least, I can guarentee you that the sender is not Linux.  Or,
if it is Linux, it is running a really broken implementation of
a web server. :-)
Franks a lot,
