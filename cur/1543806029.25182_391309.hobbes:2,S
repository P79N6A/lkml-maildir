No! I agree that the kernel keyring is a good place to keep keys because
it has been designed with the correct inheritance rules. I do not agree
with the above logic that the kernel is inherently safer than userland.
By the above logic, we should put libpam, openssl, kerberos, all login
programs, kdcs, etc all in the kernel. That will not happen!

I don't have to. Why are you apparently insisting on this weird fallacy
that a keyring can only hold one certificate at a time?
However if you want an example of how I can do this, just look to
kerberos. What is probably the world's most commonly used security
mechanism is entirely based on the concept of time-limited tickets. When
I log in, I get a TGT, which is a time-limited proxy ticket that allows
me to obtain more tickets without having to re-enter my password. This
again allows me to obtain "service tickets", i.e. time-limited proxies
with limited capabilities for any service that requires it.
