Well, the comment says
"Exercise Play with this in several situations. You may have to be root."
and the source says
        if (! (flags & CLONE_NEWNS))
                return 0;
        if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)) {
                put_namespace(namespace);
                return -EPERM;
        }
so there is not much hope for a regular user.
Now you ask: but why ENOMEM?
That is a tiny flaw in the kernel source.
I suppose

would fix that.
