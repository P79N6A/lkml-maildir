a) is true if 'some' means 0.000001%. I maintain thousands of virtual
hosts with millions of hits per day and I cannot remember when I
last saw in the logfiles that someone was using a browser that
didn't send the Host: header.
Besides, a browser like that won't be able to view todays HTML anyway.
Think again - you're wasting precious IP space .. RIPE (the European
equivalent of ARIN) will not even honour requests for IP allocations
for web servers anymore in most cases.
