Let's wait and see. If BeOS is better for you then Linux then use it instead.

Perhaps. I doubt it in Windows case, though. I've seen quite a few times
how Windows just started to do something deep inside it it and stopped to
respond for few seconds altogether. So how ANYONE can even talk about
latency mesuared in MILLIseconds, not in SECONDS for that beast is beyond
me.

Ask Mindcraft :-)

Oh, yeah. But it's so obvious way that I excluded it :-)

Who ? Just curious.

And rightfully so. Patch is NOT about "worst-case latency". It's called
"real-time" and said patch DO NOT provide that. Patch tries to reduce
linux kernel latency "in most cases" but you STILL will not have GUARANTEED
"worst-case latency" of 5ms or 100ms. And Larry rightfully said "if you need
real-time then you need real-time period." Perhaps you DO NOT need real-time
but then WHAT exactly you need and WHY you think low latency patch will give
you that ?

Hans done that :-) He used quite a few styles to upset peoples: whining,
screaming, accusing. He was highly sucessfull: quite a few peoples become
upset ... Now Robert Dinse tried to do the same for low latency patch. He
was less successfull though ...

Hmm. Looks like you got enough opinions on that question too. No ?

Such observation can be predicted and he is not first one who noted this.
This part was good. But then he concluded that improvement should be enough
for patch to be applied as "a onfiguration option". Thus showed that he
REALLY can not understood why patch was rejected in first place. For that
part he was pilloried (sa you formulated it). And rightfully so.

Why ?
