I was under the impression that libata pata and ide drivers are mutually 
exclusive.  You're not  supposed to be using both at the same time 
unless they're for completely different controllers.
Maybe this should be in the config to auto unselect the other equivilant 
driver (+generic) when either the libata or ide one is user selected, or 
at least mentioned in the help for future testers.
Since libata is loaded after regular ide, having generic ide compiled in 
is a problem.  Generic drivers should be loaded after all specific 
compiled in drivers and generic libata should override generic ide.  
This seems to be very complicated if both interfaces are to be around at 
the same time for a while.   Maybe it should just be mentioned in the 
Help for libata drivers  that it's best to just disable all regular ide 
drivers when using libata pata ones.
