I suspected I'm not the only one who is getting these exact same Oopses
(and the lockups that follow them) so earlier today, I've decoded the Oops
I got, and found that the problem is in vmscan.c:line-605, where 
page->mapping is NULL and a_ops gets resolved and dereferenced at
0x0000000c. 
I leave the fix for the mm experts, I've notified Linus, I guess he's
looking into it.
