With this kernel I can run for some 20 minutes, then the ip_dst_cache 
overflows.
I gather it has something to do with RCU...
If I just let it run and grep ip_dst_cache /proc/slab it goes up to 4096 
(max) and then the printk's are starting, and the networks stops.
After i up the limit to the double (echo "8192" > 
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size) network starts to work again.
But of course, after a while it overflows again:
# grep ip_dst_cache /proc/slabinfo
ip_dst_cache        8192   8205    256   15    1 : tunables   16    8 
  0 : slabdata    547    547      0
I haven't tried the vanilla 2.6.12-rc2 kernel, and I don't have the time 
to do that right now, but i figured it would have something to do with 
your patch. Older 2.6.8 works just fine.

Magnus
