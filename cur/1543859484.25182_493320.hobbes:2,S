Perhaps I missed it, but, when is PMP support going to be included in
main-stream?  Seems like it's been around for a while now and I doubt
I'm the only one extremely frustrated with having to hunt down an
external patch to get a new toy supported.  I'll probably bug the Debian
kernel folks next but it'd be nicer if it was in upstream.
	Thanks!
