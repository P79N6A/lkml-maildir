Not so emotional argument...
System where users can mount their own filesystems should not be
called "Unix" any more. It introduces new mechanism, similar to
ptrace. It restricts root in ways not seen before. How is
updatedb/locate supposed to work on system with this? How is it going
to interact with backup tools? 
Add this to your A): "by tricking some interpretter to think script is
setuid".

Argument is "it is **** ugly".
Your fuse.txt explains why it is not security hole. It does not
explain why your interface is the best possible, and what alternative
ways of "not security hole" exist.
