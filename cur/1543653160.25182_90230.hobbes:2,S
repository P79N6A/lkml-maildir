lspnp output at the end.
It has 2 infrared ports(well its the same port in 2 places....) , one rs232 
port on the back, and a modem port.
This is an IBM thinkpad, so imagine BIOS from hell, its all gooey and 
useless...  I think you are supposed to be able to switch the serial port 
from infrared to the rs232 port, but I don't know how.  I use the infrared 
anyway so thats ok :)
It might be flipping out over the modem, its one of those mwave DSP things.  
Neither the modem or the sound work in linux right now... I would need to 
install 
http://www-124.ibm.com/acpmodem/
 to get just the modem working..and I 
really don't even care :)
If anything I would like the sound to work.  I think once its initialized it 
ends up being sb compatible, but I think even then its only 8bit sound, which 
isn't even worth it.
even after 
"PnPBIOS: set_dev_node: Unexpected status 0x85"
The IR port still works, so it doesn't seem to break anything...
