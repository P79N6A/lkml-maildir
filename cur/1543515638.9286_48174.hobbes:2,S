Normally the boards are set up as ring buffers. Obviously it is up to the 
board what works and how. The user view is that you feed it data till it
blocks or says "would block". You select and when there is space it wakes
you. A set of ioctls let you control the wakeup points and query the ring
position

Driver dependant.

The commercial OSS does, the free one does not. We don't intend to add
mixing in kernel space. It is for daemons such as esd to manage.

Take a look at SDL. That has a pretty good abstraction layer for audio from
what I remember.
