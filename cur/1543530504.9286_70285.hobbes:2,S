we want to keep 'permanent debugging code' out of the main kernel, as much
as possible. There is no problem in having separate debugging patches
(such as IKD, which is a much more capable debugging tool than plain
asserts). Permanent debugging code pollutes the kernel over time and
degrades readability and maintainability.
