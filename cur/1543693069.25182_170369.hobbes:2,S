I've added the below patch to fix a few warnings:
arch/i386/kernel/efi.c:446: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
arch/i386/kernel/efi.c:455: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
arch/i386/kernel/efi.c:455: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
Please review, and test 2.6.0-test6-mm3 or later to make sure that things
are all OK.
Also, we really should make the EFI code CONFIGurable - it's another seven
kilobytes which a lot of people won't be needing.  A patch against -mm
which implements that would be appreciated.
