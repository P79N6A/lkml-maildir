It turns out that this is a non-issue. I can't quite explain how I came to the 
impression that there is a clock lag, but current status is that the clock 
runs correctly. So sorry for the noise.

Thanks for the pointer, Lee. I'm now running the clockfix CVS branch and the 
problems are solved. So the -rt kernel is fine.
Thanks for the help,
Wolfgang
