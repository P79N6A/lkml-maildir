last time i tried it (-test7 or so) it worked. your normal fbcon and 
what not drivers do not work. They haven't been updated to handle the 
new fb code. You'll need to do all your configuring via kernel or module 
loading and cross your fingers and hope xfree86 can load based off it. 
  Also, i never got a non-blank console when using matroxfb... once it 
loaded i always had to blindly move around and start X and what not.
But, what's really the point in using X with matroxfb? You lose half 
your memory off the bat that X cannot access and you get no added 
performance or anything.  It really does not seem worth it.  Use 
matroxfb if you need to do fb stuff in a console without X.  Otherwise, 
stick to just plain console and X and forget about matroxfb.
