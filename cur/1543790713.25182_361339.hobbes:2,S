Initially Linus said that he would only accept e-mail patches after
rc1 ... but common sense prevailed and he later clarified to say that
git merges could still be used, but only to include bug fixes.
Also note that a whole new driver (or filesystem) might be accepted
after -rc1 because there is no risk of causing regressions with
such a change.

There isn't really a hard schedule for when -rcN for N>1 are released.

IIRC the goal was to make a release in around 8 weeks (which would
be closer to six per year).  But you have the important part, which is
that Linus doesn't make the release until it is "ready".  2.6.13 was
released on August 28th, and 2.6.14 on October 27th ... so we
appear to have hit the goal this time through.
