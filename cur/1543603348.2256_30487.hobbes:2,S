I think if you want better than 1s resolution you need to
handle it in user space. I've done this using 2 methods
outlined below. This first may be more responsive for
your app, though depending on the processing you have
to do on each file it may be too great an overhead to
process things twice, and if you want to process the data
multiple times within a second then you're screwed (you
probably don't want to do this from what I understand?).
A generation counter like you suggest would be very nice though!
Padraig.

    if (!stat(file->name, &stat_st)) {
        if (stat_st.st_mtime != file->last_mtime) {
            modified = true;
            file->last_mtime = stat_st.st_mtime;
            sleep(1); //make sure any new updates in this mtime processed.

               Will do redundant check if no data written between now 
and next check
               but at least no new data will go unnoticed. Note this 
function must be called
               at a resolution >= 1 second for this to work. */
