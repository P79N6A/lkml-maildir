It would be quite nice just to have dwarf2 unwind information, with an
unwind handler, for the classic non-vsyscall restorer in Glibc.
Then MD_FALLBACK_FRAME_STATE_FOR could be removed from GCC on all
Linux targets, regardless of kernel version.
Once that is working it will be much clearer what exactly to send
Linus for the vsyscall page.
