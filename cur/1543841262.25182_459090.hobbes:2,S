Changing saved_command_line is a modification to all
architectures... They all modify this variable...
So, should I submit a patch to all architectures? How can I test this?
Also for i386 the code is assembly... So I can modify the code to write
into a __init buffer and then kmalloc in setup.c.
Please instruct me how to proceed...
