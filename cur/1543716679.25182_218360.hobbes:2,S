I havea modified patch from Nikita that does the
if (ptep_test_and_clear_dirty) set_page_dirty from
page_referenced, under the page_table_lock.
So it also picks up pages coming off the active list.
It doesn't do the wakeup_bdflush thing, but that sounds
like a good idea. What does wakeup_bdflush(-1) mean?
