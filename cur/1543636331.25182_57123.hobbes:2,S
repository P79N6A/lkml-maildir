I didn't explicitly mention it, but I have successfully run recent
kernels (2.5.2[4,5,6]) with and without the rmap patches with up to 64
dbench clients with no problems observed.  Also 2.4.19-rc[1,2] works
well.  2.5.25-dj2 is the only kernel which has had this dcache.c BUG.
I didn't test 2.5.25-dj1.
