I don't know anything about the ICH5 and ICH6.  I'm checking with
another engineer to see if the hardware interface is the same (or
similar) between the ICH5/6 and nForce audio.  I'm definitely in support
of making it more vendor-neutral if another vendor can use this
commonality.

I believe the nvaudio driver was forked off from the i810_audio driver
at kernel version 2.4.19, so I think the answer is probably no.  I
apologize for not knowing about the bug fixes.  I'll look into that now.
