Ok.  I didn't go digging for all the details, just grepped in kernel/*.c.  
(I don't have the time to deal with 2.2 at work, and at home I need to 
figure out how to con Red Hat's installer into upgrading via FTP at 28.8 
through a masquerading router.  [Switching distros is not an option.  I 
usually end up supporting CMU's Red Hat installations by experimenting with 
mine.])  I saw little usage and concluded erroneously that it was there for 
"system self-description" purposes.

sys5's always been good for bizarre networking.  Remember RFS?
So, upshot is that RH still has it right, but we're in for another dose of 
the bad old days when people were convinced that "domainname" meant DNS.  
Plus ca change....  Oy.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
