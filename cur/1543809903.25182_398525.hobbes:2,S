So I'll have to remove all code that relies on the task_list. Is 
proc_check_exe_fown() the only function that is affected by this?

Is there an alternative for locking the tasklist, and iterating through all 
the threads to: find out the struct task*  given a struct fown_struct*. Or is 
there any other way to find out the inode, and mountpoint of that process?
Thanks,
