the patch below implements this simple and pretty robust logic ontop of
the -AF NX patch.
in fact it's more conservative than what we have in Fedora because it
will turn on executability even for data mmap()s. (in theory there could
be third party apps that expect a data mmap to be executable on x86 even
if it's not PROT_EXEC.)
I've test-booted it on an athlon64 box running FC2 and have tested an
old PT_GNU_STACK-less binary and it indeed has all data mappings
executable, explicitly. (I've also test-booted it on an x86 box with an
older distribution installed - works as expected.)
newly-compiled applications that have the PT_GNU_STACK flag (either as X
or NX) will have the heap non-executable, and the stack executable
depending on the value of the flag.
hm?
