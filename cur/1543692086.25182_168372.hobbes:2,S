I expressed it badly.  But the kernel using BK both introduces people
to BK, and it validates BK as a useful tool.  Especially as the kernel
tends to embody many of the best practices in the community.
The only sure piece of the solution I have it to keep saying there is
a problem, and to raise the level of the conversation to it's
technical merits.

It does not have to start as a BK killer.  Just something that is
architecturally sound, once all of the basics work adding the polish
can be done by the community.
I am pretty certain I could write up something that got the core of
the repository right in a month or two.  The hard part is avoiding
mistakes in repository architecture.  CVS has never recovered, despite
a lot of good work put into it.  For the few blunders Larry has made
he has worked very hard to correct things.
But of course if I do something I won't be targeting the kernel
developers directly.  I will do it to solve my problems on the
projects I lead.  Which may not map well to kernel development.  But
doing anything else would be an academic exercise because I could
not maintain it.
