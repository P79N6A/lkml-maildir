Andrew,
Here's a patch to line up the "CPU: After * identify, caps:" messages
produced by printk's in arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c
Numbers are easier to compare visually when they line up. Both in dmesg
output and in logs. It's also more pleasing ro look at this way in my
oppinion.
I've posted this to lkml previously in a slightly different version that
drew the comments below from hpa & Dave Jones. This patch makes the
changes suggested by them - for inclusion in next -mm maybe?

The patch below has all spaces in the same place as requested.

The patch below adresses 'a' by indenting the third line similar to the
first two. 'b' I'm not able to do anything about, that's beyond my
abillities currently.
Here's the patch, against 2.6.7-mm2.
