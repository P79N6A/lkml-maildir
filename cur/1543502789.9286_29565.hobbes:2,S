Hi All, 
I am new to this group and linux kernel. I want some information on task
queues.
 I am writing a loadable module in linux 2.0.35. I have two tasks , packet
classfier  and packet scheduler.  classifier classifies the packets
into one of the queues ( which i define). packet scheduler takes the
packets from the queues and sends out to the network. 
	One of these tasks is queued by itself or by the other task for
processing as long as packets are in queues or received from the interface.
I am using task queues to queue the task.If I use tq_timer to queue the
tasks, my module is working fine, but with less resolution i.e these are
called  for every 10ms( I am wring this module for x86 plotform). I want
these to be called  once in every millisecond.  If I use tq_immediate for
both of my tasks, system appears to be hanging as long as the packets are
transfered thru the machine. I don't exactly know when these  task_queues
are scheduled. Can some one tell me when these tasksqueues are scheduled
and anything  more about these queues? Or a  way to get timers with having
resolution of one millisecond?
Thanks in advance,
chandu
