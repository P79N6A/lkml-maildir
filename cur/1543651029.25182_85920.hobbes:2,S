Don't those bit errors have a Poissonian character ? If so, it's
impossible to "keep up". All you can do is make the interval small
enough that, on average, it takes a long time until you get hit
twice (or more often) in that interval.
A better example would be car tires on roads with many randomly
distributed sharp objects (i.e. such that age does not significantly
change the odds of tire damage): you can keep going as long as you
can get a flat tire fixed before another tire gets punctured. But
sometimes, you may end up with two flat tires, and need a tow truck.
