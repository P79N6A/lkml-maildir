OTOH I wonder how do they use DN 21-31? The board uses lines AD11 to AD31
(21 lines) for selecting devices #0 - #20. 32-bit PCI bus has only 32
address/data lines :-)
Perhaps they mean AD20-AD31 lines = device #9 - #0x14=20? If that is
the case, you can try:
- their "DN30" = device 0x13 = 19, which is apparently what the VIA riser
  card does,
- their "DN21" = device 0xA = 10, which could work as well.
I'm afraid both would require (different) soldering.
It's possible that the riser card includes a bridge, though. A bridge
chip can select devices differently and thus it can handle 32 devices.
