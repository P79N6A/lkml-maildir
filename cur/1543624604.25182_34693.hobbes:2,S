Andre, 
Jens just described what can be violated:
"First of all, rq->buffer cannot be indexed for the entire nr_sectors
range -- it's per definition only the first segment in the request, and
can as such only be indexed within the first current_nr_sectors number of
sectors. The above can be grossly out of range..." 
Can you tell me why his is wrong ?
BTW, I just checked 2.5 and it seems to be the similar (on the non-BIO
case).
