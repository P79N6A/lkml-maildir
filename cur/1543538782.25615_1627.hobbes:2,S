Yes.
If people wondered why the "->priority" -> "->nice" change was done, now
you know. "->priority" used to be a tick-based nice level, and it just
wasn't able to handle UNIX semantics when the resolution of ticks dropped
to just a few ticks.
Simple vulcan mind-trick. Switch them around, and instead of calculating
"nice" from the number of ticks, we calculate ticks from the virtual nice
value, making the problem go away and allowing for a shorter timeslice
without having to do major surgery.
