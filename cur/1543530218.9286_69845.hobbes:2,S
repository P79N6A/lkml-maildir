Not really; either way, we are being asked for memory we can't currently
provide.

It was never really a "kernel problem" as such anyway. It's a problem the
kernel is trying to fix.

It was all along - you don't have enough RAM+swap for the workload the
system is under, so processes are dying.

That would help, yes, in this particular system. It's not a general

But this does nothing at all to prevent runaway root processes blowing the
system away, for example.

Yes - I OOMed this machine last night, and almost everything died as a
result (thanks to me *NOT* having Rik's patch in yet.) These are not
normal circumstances, though...

Yes, I agree. However, we can still run out of RAM+swap on multiuser
systems quite easily.

The problem is, denying memory requests leads to processes dying. This is
what we want to avoid.
In fact, last night I more or less killed this machine. I had overcommit
turned off, and nothing major loaded (X, WWW server, xmms) and fired up
"make -j" on a biggish source tree. After quite some time, just about
everything died from lack of memory.
This was WITHOUT the OOM killer patch. With it, I think the newly spawned
make and cc processes would have been killed off much sooner, helping save
the other processes.
How would you define "running out" of memory? I would define it as not
being able to fulfil new requests - which is the situation we are trying
to handle here. If you start denying malloc() requests, processes start
dying (largely at random). If, instead, you kill selected processes, then
obviously processes still die as a result. However, they are more likely
to be the "right" ones to kill.
