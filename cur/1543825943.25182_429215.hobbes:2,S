Subject: [PATCH-rt] ARM: Fix dump_stack() config dependencies
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

DEBUG_ERRORS does not depend on DEBUG_MUTEXES and the kernel will not
build if the former is enabled and the later disables. Other option is
to make DEBUG_ERRORS automatically enabled DEBUG_MUTEXES in the RT case.
