Well, the other way around is to upgrade e1000 driver in the 2.4.21EL-smp,
as the machine I'm using is quite new, and RHES3 kernel can't find the
Ethernet device, so the machine has no network.
My first idea was to consider this as an opportunity to upgrade to the
latest 2.4.x kernel, but reading you, this looks like a bad idea...
2.6.x would be better ?
Regards,
Paul
