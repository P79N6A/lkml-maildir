If we want a calming period, we need to do development like 2.4.x is 
done today.  It's sane, understandable and it works.
2.6.x-pre: bugfixes and features
2.6.x-rc: bugfixes only

If you think it will be only a week, you're deluding yourself.  It will 
stretch out to a month or longer, and the backlog problems will be real.
A calming period is fine.  But this even/odd mess is just silly.
