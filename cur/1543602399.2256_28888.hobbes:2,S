Yea, it is a single port card... I had meant to mention that in the email I 
sent out...  ie: that it wasn't reporting correctly... but, I didnt really 
think it was related, since the eepro was doing the same thing.
  As for comparing with ifconfig, I ran 'watch 1 ifconfig -a', and sure 
enough, I have about ~7000-7500 packets coming in right now.  And, the 
'procinfo -D', reports ~21000-22000 interrupts per second.
  Other sources I have used to confirm packet rate... include output from 
'sniffer', a flow generator that was monitoring that link, and the hub this 
machine is plugged into.
  the hub has 3 active ports.. port 1 is one side of our internet conenction 
(out to our provider), port 2 was from the hub over to our main router... port 
3 is a mirror of the IN on port 1 and the OUT on port 2 to port 3.  Comparing, 
and verifying, showed port 3 getting 10K packets (this afternoon, which 
obviously drops at night, which it is here now), and down to 7K now.
