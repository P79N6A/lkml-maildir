How would it be useful?
CRTSCTS is for CTS only (i.e., the transmission is paused when CTS is
inactive), not for RTS. DTR and RTS should be active when the port is
open even without CRTSCTS (= without handshaking), it's used for
various purposes such as providing +12V to the device (and two pins
can supply more power than one - sure, it isn't the best idea).
I wouldn't touch that.
