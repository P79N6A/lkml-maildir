   I don't think this should be (purely) an arch thing.  It's just as
   much a driver issue.  For example, HPET will pretty much work the same
   on x86 and ia64, so being able to have a shared "driver" would be
   useful.  I agree though that it would be nice if arches that don't
   care for time-interpolation at all could turn it off completely.
   In the proposal below, an architecture could achieve that by turning
   off CONFIG_TIME_INTERPOLATION.
That's not the issue, if I have only ONE way to do this on my
platform, I can INLINE this thing and I DO NOT need function
pointers.
I should have that option.
