Ah, the MSG_ORDERED_TASK did probably not exist when I originally did
the patch (a year or so ago, iirc). I'll change the define to follow the
rest of the code.

Yes you are right.

I already have this fixed locally by just maintaining a fifo list of
queued commands so we can retry them in the correct order. For 2.5
there's a busy and free list (so no more scanning for a free command
either), I would imagine that the easiest for 2.4 is to just maintain a
busy list in addition to the current array of pending/free commands.
