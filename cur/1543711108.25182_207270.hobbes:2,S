That is not the impression I got from this post:  
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104554480315013&w=2
This thread is the other one that came to mind:  
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105915495603446&w=2
In one post in the thread spawned by the second URL's post, Alan Cox
suggests a plan vaguely similar to what you outlined below what I've
quoted (ie: a MODULE_UNLOADABLE flag or something for those modules that
_can_ be easily unloaded).
However, the general impression I get from that thread on removing module
refcounting is that in general unloading modules is tricky.  Not
unsolvable.  Just tricky.
