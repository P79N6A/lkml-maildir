Please don't do that. I cannot easily take the address of a per CPU 
variable on x86-64, or rather only with additional overhead. If you need the
address of one please use a different macro for that.
[on x86-64 per cpu data is referenced using a segment register, but
leaq %segreg:offset,%reg does not do the expected thing, it just loads 
offset but doesn't add in the segment register base address. To get the
address I always need to fetch a pointer from the the per cpu data 
that points to itself and work with that]
