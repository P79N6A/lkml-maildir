Hi,
One question from Linux-Tag was about the lack of documentation about/in 
the kernel. I try to maintain docbook entries when I modify code, even 
though I think it's mostly wasted time: Virtually noone reads it anyway, 
instead armchair logic on lkml.

Not, it's not even a hypothetical situation. It's an explicitely 
forbidden situation: SMP signals are sent with smp_call_function and the 
documentation to that function clearly says:
 *
 * You must not call this function with disabled interrupts or from a
 * hardware interrupt handler or from a bottom half handler.
