Subject: Alpha: replacing "extern inline"

I want to get rid of all "extern inline" in the kernel.
Why?
"extern inline" generates a warning with -Wmissing-prototypes and I'm 
currently working on getting the kernel cleaned up for adding this to 
the CFLAGS since it will help us to avoid a nasty class of runtime 
errors.
"extern inline" was required at the times when 
__attribute__((always_inline)) wasn't avalable.
Nowadays, we use "static inline", and if there are places that really 
need a forced inline, we use "static __always_inline".
Can someone tell me which of the Alpha "static inline"'s need for some 
reason an __always_inline?
And a related question:
Does the never defined __IO_EXTERN_INLINE still have any purpose?
