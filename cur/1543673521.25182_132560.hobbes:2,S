PAG != tokens.
PAG is a simple unique session identifier. AFS, Coda and DCE/DFS happen
associate credentials with a session.
But there is no reason why multiple PAG's can't map to the same set of
credentials. You still don't 'join' a PAG, it is up to some filesystem
specific policy how PAGs are mapped to credentials.

I think we are saying the same thing. But abstract at a different level.
Yes, a new session could use the same credentials as an existing
session. But it is still a new session.

How long should the credentials be kept around? The kernel doesn't know
the difference between a Kerberos ticket, an AFS or Coda token, or a DCE
security context. In my case only the Coda servers can reliably tell us
whether the token is valid at all.

That seems to be more an implementation issue, the token (or actually
PAG) has to be associated with the open file handle. Logging out doesn't
matter, except if the user explicitly flushes all tokens associated with
his PAG.
