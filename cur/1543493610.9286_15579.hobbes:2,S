It doesn't. By default each child process serves 30 requests before
exiting; you can turn that up if the requests are simple. This
optimization is in there precisely because fork() isn't free.

Then you lose the memory protection that the current scheme gets you.

Doh! Hammer. Head. Bang. OK, I'm mostly joking, but...

That's how ircd works, but I wouldn't necessarily think it would be
better under load. select() is not cheap, and you have extra system
calls to avoid blocking while sending output, and you have to avoid
blocking on the disk.
Now if you invented a syscall which was specifically designed to
collect input from many sockets and write output to many sockets, that
might be a win.
