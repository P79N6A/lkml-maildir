If you revert the commit you end with all the PCI resource tree breakage

The patch I sent ages back is perfectly adequate for 2.6.20-rc/2.6.20
final. Jeff is correct that it isn't perfection in all cases but it does
no real harm and the right fix (removing the whole bogus combined mode
garbage) is short and simple.
If Jeff doesn't get you a patch please let me know before reverting it
and I'll send you the one I'm using that folks have tested and works.
