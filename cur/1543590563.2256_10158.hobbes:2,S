Subject: eepro100/usb interrupts stop with 2.4.x kernels?

Since about 2.4.2, I have been seeing intermittent hangs on my system;
usually once or twice a week, but once just 10 minutes after rebooting.
What seems to happen is that the kernel stops seeing interrupts on the
IRQ shared by eth0 (my outside interface) and usb-uhci.  I can still
ssh in on eth1, and when I do, syslog contains things like "eth0:
Interrupt timed out" and usb-uhci griping about devices that failed to
accept new endpoints.
I'm not sure if for some reason my chipset stopped passing these
interrupts on to the kernel, or if the kernel got into some funny
state and stopped accepting those interrupts.  Any hints on where I
should look?
From /proc/interrupts now:
