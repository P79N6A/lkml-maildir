Talking about performance for a function that returns NR_CPUS seems a 
little out of scope IMO (I'd rather exclude tight loops calling sysconf, 
since the info will be const). My objection was more to look at the 
standard way we currently have to export information toward 
userspace/glibc. At this time /proc/ is a standard supported by all 
architectures. The (V)DSO is currently not. If the (V)DSO would have been 
a standard, we wouldn't have had this conversation ;)
