Hi,
I have difficulties figuring out the real names of the people behind
these addresses (BK linux-2.4, since v2.4.19 to current):
If anyone can tell me the real name behind either of these addresses, or
knows for sure a team name (info@usblcd.de and
jfs.adm@hostme.bitkeeper.com are candidates for that), please let me
know, and please don't mangle your name removing umlauts or other
national characters.
The results are meant to become part of my lk-changelog.pl script and
for later merge into bk://gkernel.bkbits.net/BK-kernel-tools/
My sources comprise the lbdb of mails to linux-kernel and a quick
google.com search for the mail address in double quotes
(
http://www.google.com/search?q=
%22fubar@us.ibm.com%22).
Thanks in advance for any help. Here's the list.
