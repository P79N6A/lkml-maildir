Looks good, Eiichiro, thanks for posting this.

For this version, I don't think you need delay.h or dmi.h.  And like Bjorn 
mentioned, this could probably be turned into generic code in drivers/pci 
so we don't have too much duplication with x86 (and like I mentioned, 
x86_64 could probably use this too).
