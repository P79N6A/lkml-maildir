Does this machine have ECC memory ? If so, have you tried to check the
error counters ? And if not, well, it might be some random bit flips
in memory.
Last year, I encountered a really strange situation. During about one week,
I had 3 or 4 machines that have panic'd several times each, and sometimes
only some multi-threaded apps would freeze (eg: pdnsd). These machines
were installed at different customers' in different locations, and at
different times. They had never crashed before, nor did they after. Most
other similar machines at other customer's, or some at the sames did not
experience this. This was during the first week of november, when there
were the very strong solar flares. I never told the customers about my
thoughts on the subject, they would have definitely made fun of me. So
we replaced the RAM sticks, to report something more believable...
Regards,
Willy
