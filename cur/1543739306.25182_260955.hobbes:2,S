Well think about it as an x86 p-code interpreter then ;-) Kind of like a 
forth interpreter for Open Firmware but we use an x86 image instead.

I agree entirely, provided we can find a way to get this to run really 
early in the boot sequence. We need this for non-x86 embedded machines 
such as PowerPC and MIPS, not for x86 platforms where the BIOS can be 
called from the boot loader easily.

That is a good point. Another good reason to have the code in there ;-)
