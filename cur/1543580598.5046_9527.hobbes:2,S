I tried to reproduce the BUG message, but I was unable to get to the same
situation again. (I tried to create several different RAID0 partitions,
format them to ext2 and tried mounting the partitions alone. I did get some
weird messages from partitions I did manage to mount (what you would expect
from mounting such partitions) but no more BUG messages.)
So unfortunately I can't help you to check if your fix works.
