That doesn't tell us much unless you benchmark any speed
improvements/degradations noticed.  Hidden in that 1% may be more
favorable I-cache usage, better register usage... who knows.
It would also be interesting to compile key files like kernel/sched.c or
mm/vmscan.c in assembly using O2 and Os, and compare the output with
diff -u.
