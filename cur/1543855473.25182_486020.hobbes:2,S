It is better to simply leave TSC alone if unsynchronized. If TSCs appear 
to be in sync (through some sporadic "synchronization") then people will 
be tempted to use RDTSC because it seems to work/ However, RDTSC will 
sporadically yield incoherent values (i.e. time earlier than last TSC 
read) if we have no full synchronization.
