Also humans might need to know if the botherboard is set up properly,
or can even be set up properly to be able to run the CPU at its
expected speed. FYI, I tested an expensive "blade" server that
was not configurable to anything near its advertised specifications.
The contents of /proc/cpuinfo was one of the nails I used for
the vendor's coffin.
