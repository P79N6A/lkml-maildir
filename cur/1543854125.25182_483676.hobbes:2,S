Subject: [RFC 0/7] Remove slab cache declarations in slab.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

One of the strange issues in include/linux/slab.h that it contains
a list of global slab caches. The following patches remove all the global
definitions from slab.h and find other ways of defining these caches.
6 of the 7 defined caches are rarely used. One is never used.
