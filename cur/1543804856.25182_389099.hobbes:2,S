Depends on how much meta-data you have to write out.  What if you just
altered 6000 files?  Now you have a ton of dentries to destroy and
inodes to invalidate, some FAT entries to free up, etc.  What if the
user just pulled the drive out of the USB port?  Or the USB port is
faulty and lost connection (I've seen it!).

Wha?  You mean remove the trigger, not the underlying problem.

Yeah, built-in write balancing is nice.

The "flush on power fail" is retarded because it takes extra hardware
and doesn't work if the USB port itself loses connection or if the user
is just dumb enough to pull/knock the drive out.  It won't work with
mini hard disks either, as you say.
"Flush on power fail" is pretty much getting a 10 minute UPS and issuing
'shutdown -h now' when the UPS signals init, which there's already
contingencies for (can also suspend to disk).  It won't help if the PSU
burns out, if the system crashes, if the power cord is pulled, or if the
dog walks around your chair and you turn and bump your foot into the
"power" button on the UPS itself.
