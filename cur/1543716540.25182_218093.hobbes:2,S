It already is at nice 0.
The slab shrinking fix Andrew provided reduced all the swapping to
minimum. So far 2.6.6-rc3+shrink_slab-handle-GFP_NOFS-fix has been the
most 'responsive' 2.6 (I've been following rather closely sice 2.5.75).
I can still trigger staggering and short (1/2sec) pauses when there's
memory pressure and I quit some swapped-out application. It's been this
way for a long time.
Thanks.
