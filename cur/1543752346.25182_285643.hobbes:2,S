I was waiting for them to settle down before paying more attention.
My general take is that these patches address a single workload on
exceedingly rare and expensive machines.  If they adversely affect common
and cheap machines via code complexity, memory footprint or via runtime
impact then it would be pretty hard to justify their inclusion.
Do we have measurements of the negative and/or positive impact on smaller
machines?
