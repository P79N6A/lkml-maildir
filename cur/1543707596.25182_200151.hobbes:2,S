Ah, I didn't know you meant "_any_ regular dentry create (except for
Samba operations)".
To apply that rule, you either need alternate versions of rename() and
other file syscalls, or something akin to a process-specific flag (set
by the helper module) saying that this is a Samba process and dentry
creation _by this process_ shouldn't invalidate case-insensitive
dentries.
And if you have either of those, the bit of code which says "don't
invalidate case-insenitive dentries because this is a Samba process"
can just as easily say "don't send dnotify events to the current
process".
And once you've done that, it's easier just to add a DN_IGNORE_SELF
flag to dnotify meaning to ignore events caused by the current
process, and forget about the helper module.  That'd be useful for
other programs, too.
