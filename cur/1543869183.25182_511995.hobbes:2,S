I hear the same strange noise on poweroff (2.6.20 vanilla). This is what I
get on my system with ATA_DEBUG and ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG both defined. The
system will *not* poweroff with "halt -f" so there was no noise!

System halted.
If I do a sysrq-o right after this, the above message repeate once more and
the system turns off w/o the disturbing noise.
For the next messages, I booted the system completely (no init=/bin/sh) and
did a "poweroff" at the console prompt after the boot was completed. This
time the noise was there.
