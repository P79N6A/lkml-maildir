I'm sorry. The patch that _you_ quoted fixes a blinking LED
and nothing else. It does _not_ fix loading of rfkill or b43 in any way.
It does, however, fix loading of rfkill-input. But the b43 module
operation does _not_ depend in any way on the rfkill-input module, except
the tiny LED that doesn't blink if it's not loaded.
I hope you understood now that the thread on bcm43xx-dev was NOT about
your requirement to load rfkill before b43.

Ok. I will install a copy of Ubuntu Hardy Heron and check if I can
reproduce this.
However the fact that this does not happen on older Ubuntu platforms
and does not happen on Fedora leads to the conclusion that it
is a bug in Hardy Heron that I am not responsible for.
And you also do realise that Hardy Heron is the current development
version of Ubuntu? Development versions have bugs.

If you simply stop blaming bugs on me that I am not responsible for
at all, that is a deal. What about filing a bug at the ubuntu bugzilla?
PS:
Note that Ubuntu is known to break the broadcom driver every now and then.
But I can not change that.
