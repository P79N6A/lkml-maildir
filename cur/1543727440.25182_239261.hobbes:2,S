Subject: BUG: SCSI SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE on driver unload

On module removal of a SCSI Low-Level Driver (LLD),
the mid-layer tries to do a SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE
command to each device on each host of that driver.
But the command is issued *after* setting SHOST_CANCEL,
which means that scsi_dispatch_cmd() will *always*
fail the command inline, without passing to the LLD.
This bug shows up only for hosts/drives which support
a write-back caching scheme.  For the more common
write-thru scheme, the SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE command is
never issued, so the bug never manifests.
Cheers
