Best of all, the PowerPC and the POWER are binary-compatible to a very
large degree - just the latter has an extra set of 64-bit instructions.
What was that I was hearing about having to redevelop or recompile your
apps for 64-bit?
I can easily imagine a 64-bit filesystem being accessed by a bunch of
RS/6000s and monitored using an old PowerMac.  Goodness, the PowerMac 9600
even has 6 PCI slots to put all those SCSI-RAID and Ethernet cards in.  :)
