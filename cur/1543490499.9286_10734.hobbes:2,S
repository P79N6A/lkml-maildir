	Under different OS you will not have your hack in the kernel, so
your solution has *less* chances to work there (zero, to be precise).

	It is *completely* non-portable. Moreover, it will be useless for
situations when different names are used for different versions of
aforementioned awk (gawk vs. mawk). If you have permissions to tweak
sysctls (aka /proc/sys) you have permissions to create a symlink.

	Erm??? That is, instead of tr -d "\015" in userland where it
belongs you propose to put the thing into kernel? BTW, many interpreters
will barf and die on \r in the body of script.
