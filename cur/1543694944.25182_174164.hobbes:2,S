Hello,
I saw that last month ,  9/2003 , a new book named :
Linux Kernel Development by  Robert Love  (SAMS) was published.
As I saw it also deals with 2.6 kernel.
If any of the members of this forum had the opportunity to
read it or part of it , I would appreciate if he would share his thoughts
on it in this forum. (especially comparing to other available books on Linux 
Kernel , which
their number is not large (especially the number of updated ones).
regards,
sting
