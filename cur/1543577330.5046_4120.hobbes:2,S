I think that LP_CAREFUL is still needed.  There are printers that
think that nFault overrides the other error lines and there are
printers that drag nFault to 'okay to print' when off.  To keep
everyone happy (those that want to print to error-line-wreckless
printers, and those that want jobs being sent to a printer that's off
to wait until the printer comes online) I think we need LP_CAREFUL to
remain.
Tim.
