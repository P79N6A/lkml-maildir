Subject: [PATCH] fix OOM killing of swapoff
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These days, if you swapoff when there isn't enough memory, OOM killer
gives "BUG: scheduling while atomic" and the machine hangs: badness()
needs to do its PF_SWAPOFF return after the task_unlock (tasklist_lock
is also held here, so p isn't going to be freed: PF_SWAPOFF might get
turned off at any moment, but that doesn't really matter).

Will be needed in 2.6.19-stable too.
