Not yet.  The kernel has the ability to go out and read PnP data from parallel 
port devices but as far as I know nobody has yet written the user-space 
support to actually do anything useful with it.  Red Hat seemed to be 
interested in this kind of thing at one point though they were concentrating 
initially on printers.
