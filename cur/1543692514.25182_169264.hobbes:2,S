Subject: get into sleep and release the lock in an atomic operation

Consider the few lines of code:
spinlock()
if (num == 0) {
  sleep and release the spinlock in an atomic operation.
}
In the OS like HP-UX there was a sleep lock concept, the
code would look like:
get_sleeplock()
if (num== 0) {
   sleep and release the lock
}
Is there any primitive that implements this kind of spinlock and
sleep in linux?  I could not find it.
I know it can be implemented.
