Normal mount _is_ do_kern_mount() + pinning down the resulting vfsmount +
attaching it to mountpoint.
The second part is what keeps them alive until fs is unmounted.  Moreover,
umount itself is just
	check refcount, return -EBUSY if the thing is busy and MNT_DETACH is
not given.
	detach from mountpoint
	drop the reference
Notice that umount _with_ MNT_DETACH will happily skip that check - and
that will simply detach filesystem from mountpoint with fs shutdown
postponed until it stops being busy.
IOW, filesystem shutdown is _always_ a garbage collection - there's nothing
special about vfsmounts that are not mounted somewhere.  Check for fs
being busy in umount(2) is just a compatibility code - kernel is perfectly
happy with dissolving mountpoints, busy or not.  If stuff mounted is not
busy it will be shut down immediately, if not - when it stops being busy.
It's actually very similar to relation between open(), unlink() and close() -
you can unlink opened files and their contents will be there until the
final close(); then it will be killed.
