I think it should be there.  Plus, as you say, it is defined
per-architecture.
The real problem in my opinion is that the category is misnamed.  It is
not "processor options" except for the first couple.  The majority of
the options should be under a title of "core" or "architecture" or
"system options" in my opinion.
