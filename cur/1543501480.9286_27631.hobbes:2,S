This seems to be correct, I changed 
	expire = timespec_to_jiffies(&t) + (t.tv_sec || t.tv_nsec);
to
	expire = timespec_to_jiffies(&t);
in sys_nanosleep(), now I got
usleep ( <=10*1000)           sleeps for 10 ms
usleep ( >10*1000 <= 20*1000) sleeps for 20 ms
usleep ( >20*1000 <= 30*1000) sleeps for 30 ms
