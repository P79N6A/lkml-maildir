I'll save myself the trouble when Linus said it better than I could:
     Note that dump simply won't work reliably at all even in
     2.4.x: the buffer cache and the page cache (where all the
     actual data is) are not coherent. This is only going to
     get even worse in 2.5.x, when the directories are moved
     into the page cache as well.
     So anybody who depends on "dump" getting backups right is
     already playing russian rulette with their backups.  It's
     not at all guaranteed to get the right results - you may
     end up having stale data in the buffer cache that ends up
     being "backed up".
In other words you have a backup system that works some of the time or
even most of the time... brilliant!
