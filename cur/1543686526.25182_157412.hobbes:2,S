Indeed I have.  And there is a reason that we have a policy at BitMover
where "formatting changes" are prohibited and we make people redo their
changesets until they get them right.
In other words, you are welcome to write a revision control system
which can look through the formatting changes and give you the semantic
knowledge that you want.  We'd love to see how it is done and then do
it in BitKeeper :)
