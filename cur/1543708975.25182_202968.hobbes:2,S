You need James Bourne's -uv patches, available at the following location :
  
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/2.4.24-updates/
He's done all the boring work of backporting only critical fixes.
There's also 
http://toxygen.net/hotfixes/
 which provides loadable modules
to fix the security bugs without even rebooting your servers.

Willy
