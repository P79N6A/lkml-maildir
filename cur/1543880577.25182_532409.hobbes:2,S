lmbench numbers are roughly comparable to mainline (lmbench seems to be
a bit erratic, but there isn't the obvious drop that cfs has).
Didn't worry about hackbench ;)

sd42 is doing about 745 context switches per second here, and perfomance is
slightly below mainline. But it isn't doing badly.

A few runs with rr_interval at 100 show that ctxsw numbers drop to 587, and
performance is up to slightly above mainline.
With the results I've got so far with all scedulers (actually I didn't try
nicksched with a small timeslice, but I'm sure it would give the expected
result)... I'd say 5ms might be too small a timeslice. Even 15ms will hurt
some people I think.
Although we could arguably tolerate this kind of regression, my box only
has 1MB caches, and kbuild is naturally context switching at over 500 per
second anyway. On something with bigger caches and less context switchy /
more cache sensitive workloads, the regression could be quite a bit worse.
(not directed at anyone in particular, but food for thought)
