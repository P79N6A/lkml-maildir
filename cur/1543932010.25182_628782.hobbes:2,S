I've just released Linux 2.4.35.5.
It simply gets up to date with 2.4.36-rc1. One important thing to
keep in mind is that I explicitly disabled the possibility to build
with GCC 4.2 because several users (me included) encountered silent
mis-compilations.
So if you think that you have built your last version with 4.2, just
check if you can build this one. If you can, then you use a correct,
older GCC version. Otherwise, you'll have to install an old one for
the moment. Anyway, this update contains enough fixes for minor to
medium vulnerabilities to justify an upgrade.
Depending on the activity in the security area during the following
weeks, this version might be the last 2.4.35.X. So if you have not
yet tried 2.4.36-rc, it is time to do so.
The patch and changelog will appear soon at the following locations:
