That was true of the entire 2.3 series ;-)
I bet some people will be running 2.4.0-testX when 2.4.0 is released
because 2.4.0 doesn't work properly for them.
And I bet there will be people who don't manage their own kernels.  They
run whatever was put on their machine, and some of them (e.g. here :-)
are running 2.4.0-testX.
The real reason I'm bitching is because I maintain a compat.h file,
similar in spirit to the compat24.h (or whatever it's called) that I
think Richard Gooch maintains.  And it works perfectly except within the
2.4.0-test series which is getting _long_ now and looks like it will get
much longer.

Agreed, KERNEL_VERSION is good.  I use it a lot.  KERNEL_VERSION_AFTER()
would be better as you can use varargs to accomodate any number of minor
versions ;-)
