1) everything concerning network development should be sent to the
   netdev mailing list (netdev@vger.kernel.org)
2) to maximize your chances of getting a useful and positive reply,
   you should provide at least the part of the code using that function,
   show your includes, and, most importantly, provide a capture of the
   error messages you're seeing. It is impossible to provide any help
   with that few information.
Regards,
Willy
