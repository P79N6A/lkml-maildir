You can use SG_IO on any block device that accepts "SCSI" commands in
the end, like ide-cd. Google for the sg driver documentation and you
will find there are various ways to submit sg commands. cdparanoia
likely uses the old variant of opening the char device and read/writing
commands to it, if you convert it to SG_IO it could use that transport
always (on 2.6 kernels and newer).
