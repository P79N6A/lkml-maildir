It will let the incoming process take over ownership of the socket,
which is probably what you mean and what you currently use.
I'm talking about a setup with the kernel residing in its own process.
On iret it would have to change ownership of the socket to another task,
i.e. process with kernel_pid wants to set task_pid as the owner of the
socket. The above code fragment doesn't permit this, as far as I can see.
What it does permit is the incoming task setting itself to the socket
owner, but that requires that the incoming task always runs a trampoline
first which accomplishes that.
