Doh! This should be the text below (the blocksize-related bug isn't fixed,
but won't be fixed for v2.0.39; it's considered relatively low-priority as

This is the last 2.0.39 pre-patch, unless someone comes up
with something horrible. Still, I'm not impossible to convince,
should there be something one of you out the consider pressing.
Give this one a tough beating, ok? Test and enjoy!
2.0.39pre7
o       Fix a bug in af_unix that wrote to      (Michael Deutschmann)
        a socket after freeing it
        (aka the Win9x-related oops)
o       Fixed typo in Documentation             (Martin Douda)
