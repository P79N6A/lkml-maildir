Not so.  The loop thread *copies* the data.  We must throttle it,
otherwise the loop thread gobbles all memory and the box dies.  This
is trivial to demonstrate.

How can this deadlock?  The only path to those buffers is
via the page, and the page is locked.

No.  Your patch removes *all* loop thread throttling, it doesn't even start
IO (thus removing the throttling which request starving would provide)
and doesn't even wake up bdflush.
If you set nfract to 70%, nfract_sync to 80% and do a big write, the
machine falls into a VM coma within 15 seconds.  The same happens
with both my patches :-(
And it's not legitimate to say "don't do that".  If we can't survive
those settings, we don't have a solution. We need to throttle writes
*more*, not less.
I'll keep poking at it.   If you have any more suggestions/patches,
please toss them over...
