But the glibc headers don't describe 2.6, do they? Don't work with 2.6?
We went around with this for cdrecord unless I misread which headers are
involved.
It's not reasonable to expect people to rebuild glibc for each kernel,
even if it is "the right thing to do" in some purist sense. It would be
better to have something like user header in the kernel for just the
interface, and have the kernel include start by pulling in the user
header and then adding things the user doesn't need.
Changes between kernel series are always unpleasant during the time when
people have to boot back and forth, we should think about a better way
to do this for 2.7.
