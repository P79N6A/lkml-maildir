Hi Chris,

strace does a lot more work than necessary for this kind of filtering.
It fetches all the arguments and *data* for the system call through a
straw one word wide named PTRACE_PEEKDATA.  A 'ucore' program wouldn't
have to do that, because almost all the time, all it needs is ORIG_EAX.
Run strace under strace and you'll see what I mean.
