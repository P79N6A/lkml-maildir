Since gcc supports boolean types and can optimize for such, introducing 
bool is IMO a good thing.

A better reason is that there is intrinsic compiler support for booleans.

We should follow what C99 directs.

NAK.  gcc >= 3 is required by now, AFAIK.
Also, you don't want to force 'unsigned char' on code, because often 
code prefers a machine integer to something smaller than a machine integer.

How is 'packed' attribute useful here?
