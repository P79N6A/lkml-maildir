Yes, this is probably a problem; I'll look through my code. It compiled
for me as a built in, but I forgot to check it as a module. Curse me!
[I'm out of brown paper bags, so I took a black plastic bag instead. I
almost suffocated. Maybe a fair punishment...]
But you can't possibly have a machine as in your config, or?
If so, I'd be amazed. I know of only two machines with both PCI and MCA,
and they are quite rare...
