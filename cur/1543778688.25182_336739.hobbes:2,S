/proc/acpi/event
/proc/acpi/sleep
are used the most.
/proc/acpi/<drivername>/<BIOS devname>/* are really screwed up
in that <BIOS devname> is an arbitrary internal BIOS string
that should have never been exposed to userspace.  Instead
we should have done what sysfs does -- look at the _type_
of device and then simply add a number to it -- cpu0, cpu1
so that a program could actually find stuff.
I'm constantly nagged that this layer in the /proc/tree
had arbitrary strings in pathnames.  Also, the /proc
file handling code is buggy -- so it wastes my time
maintaining it, when it should not exist at all...
Restoring the /proc code to the button driver will
increase button.c in size by over 60%...
So I'm in favor of whatever solution makes it all go away
as soon as possible.
