Not that one person counts for much, but here's my experience.  I've
been hand patching knfsd, RAID (and DAC960 before it got merged) for
months in order to run a stable production system.  I have no problem with
the updating of tools... if I didn't want to upgrade tools, I don't have
to upgrade kernels either, right?
I say, do the updates.
David
