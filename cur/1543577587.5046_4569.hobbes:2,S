Uh, I guess it is partially a matter of interpretation, but IMHO you
cannot have concurrent processing on a uni-processor (one instruction
stream). One thread at a time will be executing (ie. active on the processor), 
and only one. 
You can however easily do multi-processing/multi-threading on a uni-
processor.
