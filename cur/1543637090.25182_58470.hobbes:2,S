Hello, first of all, thank you for your replies.. :)
All of the reply I received asked me to take a look at the smartsuite program. I have already taken a look at those, but those doesn't help my problem. It had a support for RETURN_SMART_STATUS command, but only the status_register is returned. The value in cylinder_high and cylinder_low is not returned. So, this is of no use to me.
Any other idea? 
Thanks a lot,
-Ana
