Hi,
I'm trying to modify the ordering of I/O requests in Linux kernel, and
came across the barrier flags REQ_HARDBARRIER and REQ_SOFTBARRIER.
One thing I noticed (which might be wrong) is that all the requests
have both these flags set. What is the significance of these flags? Is
it a must for a request to have this? Can I reorder two requests with
these flags set? How is SOFTBARRIER different from HARDBARRIER?
I appreciate your time and help.
Thanks much.
