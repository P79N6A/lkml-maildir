[ Bernd, Josip, and Fabio, I think I finally nailed this
  cpu hang bug we were all seeing on sparc64.  ]
[FUTEX]: Fix address computation in compat code.
compat_exit_robust_list() computes a pointer to the
futex entry in userspace as follows:
	(void __user *)entry + futex_offset
'entry' is a 'struct robust_list __user *', and
'futex_offset' is a 'compat_long_t' (typically a 's32').
Things explode if the 32-bit sign bit is set in futex_offset.
Type promotion sign extends futex_offset to a 64-bit value before
adding it to 'entry'.
This triggered a problem on sparc64 running 32-bit applications which
would lock up a cpu looping forever in the fault handling for the
userspace load in handle_futex_death().
Compat userspace runs with address masking (wherein the cpu zeros out
the top 32-bits of every effective address given to a memory operation
instruction) so the sparc64 fault handler accounts for this by
zero'ing out the top 32-bits of the fault address too.
Since the kernel properly uses the compat_uptr interfaces, kernel side
accesses to compat userspace work too since they will only use
addresses with the top 32-bits clear.
Because of this compat futex layer bug we get into the following loop
when executing the get_user() load near the top of handle_futex_death():
1) load from address '0xfffffffff7f16bd8', FAULT
2) fault handler clears upper 32-bits, processes fault
   for address '0xf7f16bd8' which succeeds
3) goto #1
I want to thank Bernd Zeimetz, Josip Rodin, and Fabio Massimo Di Nitto
for their tireless efforts helping me track down this bug.
