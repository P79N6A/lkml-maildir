i'm not clear on when vma's are shared.
say separate processes are sharing a file (say, a system log file, or
/etc/passwd) and reads are sequential.  the problem isn't scheduling too
many read-ahead I/O's, it's that every process reading this "shared" file
sequentially will trigger the read-ahead code.  this generates a whole
bunch of page cache lookups that could be avoided.  not a big deal, but it
would be nice if the logic was smart enough to avoid it -- if read-ahead
is, say, 4 clusters, that's 64 extra page cache lookups every time that
part of the file is requested by some process.
