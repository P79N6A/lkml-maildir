I'd be glad to do this, but AFAICT the patch already entered the mm
tree, so I think that splitting it now, or sending it through a
different path would probably add to the confusion I already
managed to create :(
Implementing the "type char" should be a single patch on top of this
one, though. I'll be sure to CC you when I post it (probably today).
Thanks,
