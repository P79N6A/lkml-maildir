Hey,
	My name is Felix Cohen, and I am a researcher at Bath University, 
England. I am currently undertaking research to investigate the 
relationships between motivation and other factors on F/OSS developers 
and users.
	To this end, we have put a questionnaire online for developers to fill 
in. It shouldn't take more than bout 10 minutes, and is easy to 
complete. It is at
http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ps2fac/Research/questionnaire.html
	Please complete the form honestly. All results will be anonymised, and 
the final research will be published on the website.
Thanks,
Felix
