Note we may not care :-)  All the interpolator does is provide
a generic tick based gettimeofday implementation, and the generic
clock code does essentially the same thing.
And the generic clock code must in fact provide the implementations
in order to deal with dyntick issues.
The only other platform using the time interpolator is IA64,
and after my dyntick implementation on sparc64 the one and
only user will be IA64 :-)
