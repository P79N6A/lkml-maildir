I disagree. (a) humans are processes. (b), what's in a name? /proc has
come to mean "the place where the kernel outputs most of its info".  Fine.

WHo cares what you call it? procfs? kernelfs? Sure, separate the

Well, set their permissions appropriately then. But the fact is that
the information has to be somewhere.  How does being in proc in itself
somehow make the information less secure than in a file somewhere else?

Nonsense. Stop right there. Who cares what it was "developed for"?
There is no moral imperative that things Shall Be the Way They Were
Ordained to Be. The "was not developed for" argument is vacuous.
Human beings were not developed to fly, but they do.

Stop. You don't seem to grok "parsing is easy". That simply tells me
that you are one of the large number of programmers who can't write
parsers, and therefore think it is difficult. Your argument is false
from then on ...

Look, if I don't  read the info, it's wasted. It might as well go to
/dev/null. So I can assure you that the only important use is for human
consumption. Proc's job is to facilitate my gathering of the information
I need. It does that in the classical spirit of language design, by
providing the information in convenient _readable_ formats. It's just a
lot of ascii info. Just like configuration files. Are you arguning for
a binary registry?

Pretty often. You don't seem to get that I read it every time I use a
tool that accesses it. I even read it without tools (except that some
of the formats are not very human readable, so I prefer not to ...).

You don't get the argument. Language design. You can write your code in
assembler, or in C, or in Python. /proc is there to provide the
interface that allows us to read the data with the minimum or
effort appropriate to a  high-level interfaces: humans and
their scripts or minor programs. It's there to make life easy for US.

Embedded systems don't, by definition, have humans running them. And I
presume you in particular have no idea at all if your embedded system
is working correctly :-(.

Computers are faster parsers. Perhaps you'd like the speed figures for
parsing a 10000 line fortran program on a 386sx20? I'd estimate between
10 and 30s.  Beat that! (if you like, I'll measure something of the
sort, or dig out old figures of mine from about that era .. I seem to
recall it taking a few seconds at a time on the hp9000's)

Then in this case you happen to be a mistaken teacher. Doesn't matter.
I repeat ... parsing is easy. I'll add "fast", "efficient", too. Because
you don't seem to know that doesn't make it untrue! Check the
literature (some of it mine! Try looking for my stuff in Software
Practice and Experience about 95, and in TOPLAS too ...).

Ifconfig doesn't fail. netstat might. mount still works. Modutils still
work (apart from lsmod).

lmsensors won't work, by definition (In case you are wondering, yes, I am
typing this mail with /proc unmounted ;-).

I agree. It looks hard to tell the inner code which process is calling
it, but I don't think it has to be told. I'm almost sure that it's all
taken care of by the ordinary VFS layers. Yes. It is so. The only thing
that is not there is that there is no buffer in the interface between
VFS and the registered proc_info (or whatever) functions. Thus the
proc codes have to recalculate their data every time they are asked for
a bit of it, because they don't know how else to get to the wanted bit.

It is a little hard, yes. It belongs in the proc API.

I sort of agree. Is it open and close that are the markers
you need? You need to maintain "process x has read up to here". I.e.
you need to maintain a page of output until all its current readers
have gone away. One can't tell what they might want to do next, ever,
so "close" is a reasonable signal to accept. Or you might choose to
expire the buffer after 1s unread and refresh the data. Nah .. that's
policy. You're right. Close is the signal to dump the buffer.
OK. I'll look at it.
