I think part of the problem is the continued
misuse of the word "latency". Latency, in
language terms, means "unexplained delay". Its
wrong here because for one, its explainable. But
it also depends on your perspective. The
"latency" is increased for kernel tasks, while it
may be reduced for something that is getting the
benefit of preempting the kernel. So you really
can't say "the price of reduced latency is lower
throughput", because thats simply backwards.
You've increased the kernel tasks latency by
allowing it to be pre-empted. Reduced latency
implies higher efficiency. All you've done here
is shift the latency from one task to another, so
there is no reduction overall, in fact there is
probably a marginal increase due to the overhead
of pre-emption vs doing nothing.
