There is nothing which avoids us from doing that (there is one reserved
pool I remeber right now: the highmem bounce buffering pool, but that one
is a special case due to the way Linux does IO in high memory and its only
needed on _real_ emergencies --- it will be removed in 2.5, I hope).
In general, its a better approach to share the memory and have a unified
pool. If a given subsystem is not using its own "reversed" memory, another
subsystems can use it.
The problem we are seeing now can be fixed even without the reserved
pools.
