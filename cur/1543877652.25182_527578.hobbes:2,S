Subject: [PATCH] blackfin arch: use boot_command_line instead of saved_command_line in setup c file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

[PATCH] blackfin arch
As boot_command_line is added in init/main.c for arch-specific boot
command line, replace old saved_command_line to boot_command_line for
right boot command passing in -mm tree.
