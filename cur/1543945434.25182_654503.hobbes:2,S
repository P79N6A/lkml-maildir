    Yeah, hmm...the question I'd have then is the "only" output device 
that doesn't fit into a better category? 
    Could there be other OUTput devices in this category?   Would
renaming the category to something like "Miscellaneous I/O Devices" be
reasonable?    Are keyboard status lights considered output devices?
Are "force-feedback" devices meaning devices like a rumble-gamepad
device?  Isn't that providing output via feedback?
    Though, I would agree, most of these devices would be thought of
as "input" devices. Dang PC-SPEAKER...um...since the driver is config'ed
with the 'input' interface, dang, it really seems like it should be an
entry under sound.
    I can see the problem and I'm not familiar enough with the underlying
drivers to know how the PC-Speaker would best be handled.

No matter where it is in the 'kernel configuration', it sure seems
strange (in "user land"), to see the PC-Speaker be recognized as an
input device -- especially in light of the fact that "all speakers
are microphones" (
http://www.zyra.org.uk/sp-mic.htm
).  Would some user
wonder whether or not their speaker has some dual-circuitry to listen
as well as output (ala TV sets being 2-way video devices in Max Headroom)?
