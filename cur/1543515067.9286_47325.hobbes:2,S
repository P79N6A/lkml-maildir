Hi guys,
Below are some excerpts of private mails I have received from Jeff:

I demand people that posted Jeff about the above to send by private copy
of their postings.
I should not be interested in people who talk in my back but am very
disappointed about such evilness having appeared in the Linux community.
I will be glad to learn it is not so, by receiving the copy of the
posting Jeff is referring to. Thanks.
Gérard.
