That's an eternity for that many files to be improperly labeled.
If, and the "if" didn't originate with me, your policy is
demonstrably correct (how do you do that?) for all domains
you could claim that the action is safe, if not ideal. 
I can't say if an evaluation team would buy the "safe"
argument. They've been known to balk before.
