Actually, it was more that I didn't want to try to merge something that was 
still very much work in progress. You didn't seem to be doing any development 
on what was merged, so I didn't foresee any problems with just replacing it 
once suspend(1|2|2.1|2.2) became mature. Patrick changed that, and then you 
did too. And I learnt about the "merge early, merge often" mantra late in the 
game. If I knew then what I know now... but I didn't.
Regards,
Nigel
