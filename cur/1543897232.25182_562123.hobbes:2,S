I was curious so I did:
$ mkdir ~/foo
$ cd ~/kernel/linux-2.6
$ make INSTALL_HDR_PATH=~/foo
$ cd ~/foo
$ cat j.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "etx2_fs.h"
main()
{
	printf("helloo\n");
}
$ gcc -o j j.c
=> No warning, no errors
$ gcc -ansi -pedantic -o j j.c
In file included from j.c:2:
ext2_fs.h:53:25: warning: ISO C does not permit named variadic macros
$ gcc -ansi -pedantic -std=c99 -o j j.c
In file included from j.c:2:
ext2_fs.h:53:25: warning: ISO C does not permit named variadic macros
j.c:5: warning: return type defaults to ‘int’
Is it this part you are referring to in the above or have I overlooked something?
