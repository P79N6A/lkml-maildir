Subject: PROBLEM: please remove reserved word "new" from kernel headers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
2.4 and 2.6 kernel headers use c++ reserved word "new"
as identifier in function prototypes.
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
When kernel headers are included in compilation of c++
programs the compile fails because some header files
use "new" in a way that is illegal for c++.  This
shows up when compiling mySQL under linux 2.6.  It
uses $KERNELSOURCE/include/asm-i386/system.h.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
new, c++, kernel headers
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
2.4 and 2.6
While not an error, per se, it is kind of sloppy and
it is amazing that it hasn't shown up before now. 
using the identifier "new" in kernel headers that are
visible to applications programs is a bad idea.
Thanks,
Rob Prowel
