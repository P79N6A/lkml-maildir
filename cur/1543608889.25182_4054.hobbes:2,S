Subject: TCP Connections stuck in SYN_SENT state with 2.4.12, 2.4.13, 2.4.14

I have a strange problem, outgoing TCP packets get stuck at the SYN_SENT
point for certain websites.  Two of the sites I have this problem with
are zdnet.com and compusa.com.  When I try to telnet to port 80, the
connection will never be established, and netstat shows it in the
SYN_SENT state.
This problem occurs with kernels 2.4.12-2.4.14.  It does not occur with
2.4.10.  I am making these connections via a PPP link, but a friend of
mine has duplicated the exact same problem using a ethernet connection
(passing over DSL).  We do not have the same ISP, so I don't think that
is the problem.
Any help, or requests for more debugging info would be appreciated. 
Please CC message to me, I am not subscribed to the list.
