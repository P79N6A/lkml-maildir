Subject: please help: usb and irq problem with 2.2.18 and 2.4.0-test?

i've asked a few times, both off-list and on and nobody seems to be able
to help.
quite a few people are seeing usb fail (with the "device not accepting
new address" error messages) on the 2.2.18 and 2.4.0-testX kernels with
smp enabled when using a mobo with the apollo pro 133a chipset.  when
apic is disabled, everything works, but with it enabled, it seems that
the usb driver (usb-uhci) is not getting any interrupts.  johannes
erdfelt thinks that it's a pci irq routing problem (/proc/interrupts is
showing no interrupts for usb-uhci when apic is enabled) and suggested
talking with the pci irq people.
i eager to help debug this problem and apply any and all test patches to
find fixes.  i am pretty sure that greg k-h (greg AT kroah DOT com) is
also willing to do the same.  the problem is, we can't get any pci irq
people to look into this.  is this a problem with the pci irq routing?
is this a known problem that someone's working on?  is it just not worth
the effort?  there are already quite a few people on the linux-usb list
who are seeing this problem.  i'm sure that when 2.4.0 comes out, a lot
more people will be seeing this problem too.  please, let's try to stomp
this out before 2.4.0 and make linux look just that little bit more
shiny.  =8]  
(sorry for that bit of a rant, but i'm getting just a little bit
frustrated with this long-standing problem.)
thanks,
pete
