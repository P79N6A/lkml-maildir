If the BIOS has ACPI support, it uses some blocks in the upper MB of
memory.

If you do, put the IBM ThinkPad 600X on it: BIOS e820 memory reporting
is broken, and the machine puts its ACPI tables at the top of memory,
so you have to use "mem=(installed - 1)M" to use it or otherwise the
first ACPI event crashes the system.
