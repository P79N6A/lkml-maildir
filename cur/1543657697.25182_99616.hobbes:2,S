probably it found some buffers with the wrong ->b_size, tried to
get rid of them via try_to_free_buffers(), failed, and then fell
into the "oh, we're out of memory" loop.
You need to work out why grow_dev_page() is seeing buffers with
the wrong size against the page.  Be looking for incorrect or
missing calls to set_blocksize().
