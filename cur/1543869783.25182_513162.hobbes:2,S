Doh, wrong permission (600 instead of 644) - I've fixed this once already but
only in the public tree and not in my private mirror so during last re-sync it
got broken again.   I corrected this in both trees this time :) but it will
take some time for the change to propagate to kernel.org mirrors.
[ Thankfully this patch is the last one in the series. ]
