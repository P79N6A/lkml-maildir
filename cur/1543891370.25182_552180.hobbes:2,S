 Sure, the console will work (don't know about a console terminal
emulator).  I'm not very keen on compose keys - I find dead
diacriticals (like in X) are usually easier to enter, and I've got
all the dead latin1 accents working on my uk keymap.  Other
diacriticals for normally-latin1 keymaps are a different matter
(e.g. caron, ogonek, dot above) - they could be mapped for a
specific letter on a specific key (e.g. AltGr z for ż ; z with dot
above) but the diacritical modifiers can't be mapped for non latin1,
at least in kbd-1.12.  You can also alter the keymap to allow you do
ISO 14755 input (ctrl+shift+hex_digits) - useful for occasional
characters, if they are in your font and you can remember their
value.
