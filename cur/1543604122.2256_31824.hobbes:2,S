If you think we're missing throttling and you add the infinite loop,
yes, you'll hide the lack of throttling by looping at full cpu speed
rather than using the cpu for more useful things, but that doesn't mean
that the looping in itself is adding throttling, a loop can't add
throttling.

Mind to explain "why"? Of course you can't because it isn't fragile,
period.
If you have a list and the elements that can be freeable or unfreeable,
and you scan the whole with all the locks held and you free everything
freeable that you find in your way, you know that if you didn't free
anything after the scan completed, it means you're oom.
As said real world is more complex, but the example above is really
obvious.

The infinite loop adds oom deadlocks and hides the real problems in the
memory balancing.

I quote my first email about pre4 (I think I CC'ed you too):
	".. think if the oom-selected task is looping trying to free memory, it
	won't care about the signal you sent to it .."
and that was just a simple case, there are more problems, the above one
can be esaily fixed with a simple check for signal pending within the
loop, that is currently still missing and that you seems not to care to
add even after I mentioned this exact problem as soon as pre4 is been
released (that I didn't fixed because I'm not using the loop and because
there would be other problems and I don't need the loop just to detect
oom).
I think it's useless to keep discussing this, not matter what I say and
the problem I'm raising, you will keep thinking the loop is the right
way as far I can see.
