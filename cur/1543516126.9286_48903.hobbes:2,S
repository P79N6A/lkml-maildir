	i tried to boot 2.3.27 on an ibm thinkpad 720 (486 sx), and froze
	after the "now booting the kernel".
	2.2.13 boot just fine on the thinkpad, but i got another problem,
	that is no harddisk detected by linux. tried all IDE drivers, but
	no luck.
	i'll have this machine for a few days, so if anybody want to try
	something...
	btw, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_ONLY in Configure.help should be just
	CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD.
