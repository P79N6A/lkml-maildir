Funny that you should mention bug-free code and ABS.
Just a few months ago, Subaru updated the ABS controller code for the
WRX.  They sent me the notice in the mail.  It was an optional upgrade,
the change was only needed to fix some very odd corner cases.  
The point being that even critical micro-controller software has bugs.
Even software that has been mathematically proofed can have bugs.  Knuth
uses it as a joke: "Beware bugs in the above code.  I have
proven it correct; I have not actually tried it."
It's so funny because it's so true.
