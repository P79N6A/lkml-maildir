Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_ia32-bootmem-corruption-1
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_slab-lists-1
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_softirq-irq-1
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_x86-systable-1
	Merged in mainline.
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_invalidate_device-shrink-dcache-1
	Collect away the unused dcache before doing the same with the icache.
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_lvm-0.9.1_beta7-6.bz2
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_lvm-0.9.1_beta7-6_min-1
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_lvm-0.9.1_beta7-6_rwsem-fast-path-2
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_lvm-1.0.1-rc2-1.bz2
	Upgrade to latest's lvm kernel side.
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_module-gfp-1
	Try to allocate modules in the direct mapping rather than vmalloc
	to reduce the tlb misses. (from Andi)
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_o_direct-15
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_o_direct-16
	Rediffed.
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 00_paride-max_sectors-1
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_paride-max_sectors-2
	Rediffed (also noticed the gendisk list changes deleted too much stuff
	here so resurrected it).
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_rcu-1
	wait_for_rcu and call_rcu implementation (from IBM). I did some
	modifications with respect to the original version from IBM.
	In particular I dropped the vmalloc_rcu/kmalloc_rcu, the
	rcu_head must always be allocated in the data structures, it has
	to be a field of a class, rather than hiding it in the allocation
	and playing dirty and risky with casts on a bigger allocation.
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_reschedule_idle-cpus_allowed-1
	Reschedule_idle must be recalled during a wakeup even if the task
	cannot be scheduled in the current cpu.
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_signal-wakeup-1
	Don't waste time waking up an interruptible sleeping task twice.
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 00_vmalloc-flushes-1
	Drop the cache flushes for the virtually indexed caches and the
	tlb flushes in vmalloc path (we need that only in vfree, in
	vmalloc the virtual address space that we're going to map-in is
	guaranteed to be unmapped so there cannot be any cache about it).
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 10_prefetch-4
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 10_prefetch-5
	Part of prefetch in mainline, rediffed the architectural parts.
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 40_blkdev-pagecache-15
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 40_blkdev-pagecache-16
	Rediffed (still use rd_inode in rd.c, since it's more handy).
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 50_uml-patch-2.4.9-3.bz2
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 50_uml-patch-2.4.9-4.bz2
	Picked last update from sourceforge.
Only in 2.4.10pre7aa1: 60_tux-2.4.9-ac10-G5
Only in 2.4.10pre4aa1: 60_tux-2.4.9-ac5-C0-4
	Picked last update from www.redhat.com/~mingo/ .
