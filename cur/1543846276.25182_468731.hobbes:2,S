It's been switching to ACPI PM for somewhere near forever, I never bothered
to check into that because the PM timer provides a reasonably stable clock
source (it drifts at about 24 ppm and NTP is happy with it, and I haven't
gotten annoyed at the fact the PM timer is slow to read...)
I wonder if the TSC has been broken for forever on this box, and I'm just
seeing it because dynticks doesn't fall over to PM timer..

Looking at the source, it appears to do this:
const char SYSFS_CURRENT_SPEED_FILE[] =
     "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%u/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed";
// set the current CPU speed
void set_speed(unsigned value)
{
#ifdef DEBUG
    fprintf(stderr, "[cpu%u] Setting speed to: %uKHz\n", cpu, value);
#endif
    write_line(CURRENT_SPEED_FILE, "%u\n", value);
    // give CPU / chipset voltage time to settle down
    usleep(10000);
}
