Dirty state and mixed vma's on the same pmd would make this more complex 
than I really like, but sure..
However, the pmd almost certainly gets re-created very quickly anyway, so 
I seriously doubt you get any real wins.
Remember: the point of swapping stuff out (or just dropping them) is that
we don't need them in the near future. With a 4MB (or 2MB) granularity,
that's not very likely.
