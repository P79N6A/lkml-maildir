this is a toughie...   basically that is an invalid PCI ID that should 
not occur.  the "00ec" should really be "10ec", but it sounds like there 
is a missing bit in the EEPROM where your card's PCI ID is stored.
A better patch would add
	{ 0x00ec, 0x8139, 0xa0a0, 0x0027, ... }
because otherwise you wind up with a potential [low] chance of picking 
up boards with that same PCI device id 0x8139.

cool.  no need to test 8139cp, it won't even load with your card, since 
it is not an 8139C+ chip.

Example driver that other developers may base drivers off of...
