I discovered yesterday that printing does not work in 2.4.0-test12-pre4.
This is a pretty stock PC system with a printer on the parallel port.
Both parport and lp is compiled into the kernel - and the parport
appears to be detected OK, but the lp driver for some reason refuses
to use it:
[snip /var/log/dmesg]
Starting kswapd v1.8
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [PCSPP]
parport0: irq 7 detected
[later]
pty: 256 Unix98 ptys configured
parport0: no more devices allowed
lp: driver loaded but no devices found
In lilo, I have tried different configuration parameters. The current
setup has no parport or lp settings, but I have also tried
  "parport=0x378,7 lp=parport0"
with no apparent effect. This setting used to work in earlier 2.4
configurations (cannot say exactly which worked and which didn't).
Kernel config:
#
# Parallel port support
#
CONFIG_PARPORT=y
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=y
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO=y
# CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_AMIGA is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_MFC3 is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_ATARI is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_SUNBPP is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_OTHER is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_1284 is not set
[snip]
CONFIG_PRINTER=y
# CONFIG_LP_CONSOLE is not set
# CONFIG_PPDEV is not set
Suggestions ?
