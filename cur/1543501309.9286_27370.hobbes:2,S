I don't know what you are dpoing excatly, so I can't answer your question.
Latencies can not only be introduced by scheduling latency, but also by
interrupts holding spinlocks and similar.
I'd suggest you try my HZ=400 patch from 
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/
(It not only sets the HZ value to 400, but also fixes the times reported to
userspace.) and test it out.
Regards,
