Ah, so the measured_us and elapsed_us are trying to keep track of time between non-timer wakeups?

I tried using predicted_us and last_measured_us, and those didn't work (see the #if 0 code in my last patch). And since cpuidle_get_last_residency() is part of predicted_us, I don't think it is reporting useful values.
