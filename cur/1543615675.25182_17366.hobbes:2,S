Ah.  I must have been confused (never having seen Lindent or Indent 
myself).  We're talking about options Lindent passes to Indent?  I thought 
we were talking about new options on Lindent.  Options on Lindent don't 
really make sense.
In that case, I should modify my earlier observation and say Lindent 
shouldn't follow the majority either because it defines good style _or_ 
because it achieves consistency.  It should do it because the majority 
style is evidence of what Linus likes.
