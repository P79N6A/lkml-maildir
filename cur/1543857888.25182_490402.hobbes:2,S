I'm not sure "pure" is better than const in this case.  Although it *does* look
at a global variable (byte_rev_table), that variable is constant.  In effect,
the functions output does only depend on its input.  The R/O data it requires
is no different to its out of line code.  You'd have to consult a compiler
wrangler to be sure, though.
