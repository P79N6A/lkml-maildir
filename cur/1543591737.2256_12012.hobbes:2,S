I agree. But it would certainly force people to think about this. And it
may turn out that a lot of it can be streamlined, and not that much ends
up being used very much.
It would also allow a single place of catching the generic ones, and as
such be a place to try to make things like the network ioctl's more
regular: setting things like network device duplex with _real_ interfaces
instead of hiding it in ioctl routines.
Also, note that many ioctl's actually do have fairly regular meaning, and
that it _is_ possible to catch a number of them with those regular
things:
	switch (_IOC_TYPE(number)) {
	case 'x':
		xfs_ioctl(..);
and actually try to enforce the things that Documentation/ioctl-number.txt
tries to document. And make the clashes _explicit_ and thus make people
have more incentive to really try to fix it.

Ehh.. Telling people "don't do that" simply doesn't work. Not if they can
do it easily anyway. Things really don't get fixed unless people have a
certain pain-level to induce it to get fixed.
