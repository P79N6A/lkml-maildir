What Andreas is trying to explain to you is that the definition of
__KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES is that you would get no definitions that can
possibly pollute the name space, rather than not adding any known
conflicts (which we try with and without __KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES).
The correct patch would add new definitions for __kernel_aligned_{u,be,le}64
types that can be safely used in public data structures even with
__KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES set, and then add the existing names
for convenience for use inside of the kernel, as we do for all the
common types.
