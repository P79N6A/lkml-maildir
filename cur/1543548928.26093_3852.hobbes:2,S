Rqs are added according to the IN_ORDER() condition which enforces ascending
ordering. What does CSCAN mean ?
ie, if the queue initially is  1 2 3 it will become 1 2 3 14.
If it's 12 13 14 and we insert 2: 2 12 13 14.
So your example can happen only if the list is 12 13 14 and "14" is the
latency barrier. When we insert 15 the list becomes 12 13 14 1 2 3 15.
Am I missing something ?

I had to study it while hunting for the no-merge bug :)
