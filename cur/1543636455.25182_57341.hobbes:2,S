I just want to say that I do get a similiar panic (i hope it's the
same reason and I do not mix up something), the story about the
trouble which 2.5.26 is causing I will expound below:

 <0>Kernel panic: Attempted to kill init!

Sorry, I am just a guy having free time to test dev-kernels and to
report bugs if there are some, but I do not really know what you mean
with "backtrace" and how i should discover the effecting line number.
Please do not spare with seemingly trivial information.
Well then to the 2.5.26 misadventure story:
I patched from 2.5.25 to .26 and first it didn't want to be compiled
until I created a symlink from /usr/include/asm-generic to
/usr/src/linux/include/asm-generic (while /usr/src/linux is a symlink
to /usr/src/linux-2.5.26) - for me it seemed as if the makefile
doesn't care about include/ in the kernelsource dir, although this file
seems to be proper - a failure/ignorance of mine i do not exclude
though (if someone want to recommend to use the whole tarball, i tried
it already).
However, after the creation it compiled using the old config file of
2.5.25. The image did even boot, init stopped though when the gettys
should be invoked. So far so bad, I modified the /etc/inittab not to
use the vc's but the ordinary console instead - and the kernel
successfully booted and I could work.
This phenomenon looks like the VCs are broken, but I am absolutely not
sure, because none has complained about them so far.
To make sure I wanted to build a kernel completely new (and not just
using the old configfile), but during the boot of the resulting kernelimage I
got the panic above. If somebody wants, I can create a diff between the
configfile used by the kernel where the VCs seems to be broken and the
one of the kernel causing the panic.
