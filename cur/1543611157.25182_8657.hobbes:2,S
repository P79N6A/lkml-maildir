Generally driver vendors only certify/support against "standard" vendor
released kernels. So instead of Linux they support "SuSE 7.3" "Red Hat 7.2"
etc..
Most also make a clear distinction between what is submitted to the GPL and
hacked about under the GPL, and what they will provide any guarantee on. 
Think of it like a car.
	The engine is only supported for the car it was designed for
	You can rebore the engine but you wont get support
	You can stick the engine in a different car but you wont get support
