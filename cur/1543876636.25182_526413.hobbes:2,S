Well, even "works with the Linux driver" can be formalized with a test
plan that describes how to say it works.  But one can also imagine a
test harness that drives the virtual hardware with synthetic test data
and makes sure it does what it's supposed to.
It also helps when writing the spec to try and write lots of anal
"compliance statements" that can be tested in the suite.
But really, I just think we need a stick to shake at people to force
them to fix bugs in their virtual devices, to avoid a big mess of
quirks that defeats the purpose of the whole exercise.
