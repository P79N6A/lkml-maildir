hm, that race needs to be fixed then.

printing of the trace should not be traced. I cannot imagine any usage 
mode where that would be interesting - and i can imagine a ton of cases 
where users would be confused/distracted by the tracer in essence zapping 
their measurement by replacing it with some uninteresting 'the tracer 
itself has wakeup delays' data.
auto-disabling latency tracing while the trace is being output is 
essential. Measurement should never impact the workload that is being 
measured.
We should fix that race instead.
