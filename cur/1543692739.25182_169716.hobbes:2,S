Hm, I don't think so. I think that disabling dma and thus the polling of 
the CPU on the IDE->PCI bus simply hogs it completely.

I'm using the overlay facility, ie. the data is written directly to the 
framebuffer. There is no CPU, no scheduling and no memcpy() involved, 
just pure PCI-to-AGP busmaster transfer. If I see distortions there, 
then I guess it's a busmastering issue.
As I have already written, you can make things even worse, if you lower 
the latencies vie setpci or shrink the dma burst sizes. Then you'll get 
only pixel garbage... ;-)
CU
Michael.
