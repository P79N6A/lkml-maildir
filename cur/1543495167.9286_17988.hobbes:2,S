That was more of an expression of interest than any requirement, and
just a note on your paper records that a proposal for a use for that
partition type number has been made would be sufficient at this stage.
I have exams the week after next and the one following, but will
be taking a look at this following that.
As it happens, I've already taken the first step - I upgraded the hard
drive in one of my computers yesterday, and I included a single
cylinder partition in the middle of the disk with type code FC (which
fdisk happily accepts).
In the process, I discovered what I regard as a bug in fdisk - it is
unable to allocate a partition consisting of just the highest numbered
cylinder on the disk, although it can allocate a single cylinder
partition elsewhere on the disk. Could you look into that?
Also, whilst you're at it, could you add something along the lines of
cfdisk's Maximise function which, when applied to a partition starting
on cylinder 1, expands it to include the sectors on that cylinder that
follow the MBR on the first head?
Best wishes from Riley.
