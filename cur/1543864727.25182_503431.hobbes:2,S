Agreed, but don't we (xfs_iozero) have to map it first to zero it?
I think what you are saying here, Andrew, is that we can
do something like:
	page = grab_cache_page
	->prepare_write(page)
	kaddr = kmap_atomic(page, KM_USER0)
	memset(kaddr+offset, 0, bytes)
	flush_dcache_page(page)
	kunmap_atomic(kaddr, KM_USER0)
	->commit_write(page)
to avoid using kmap() altogether?
Cheers,
Dave.
