Using alternatives this could be near zero as well and it will likely 
have less overhead when it's actually used.

BTW I don't mind KProbes as an option, but I have huge problem with making 
it the only option.

Even dynamic tracepoints have a maintainance overhead and I doubt there is 
much difference. The big problem is having to maintain them outside the 
mainline kernel, that's why it's so important to get them into the 
mainline kernel.
You didn't address my main issue at all - kprobes is only available for a 
few archs...
