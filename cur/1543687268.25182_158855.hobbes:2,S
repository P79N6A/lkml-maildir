Alan,
	I can't believe that you're advocating networking code where:
1) It's not predictable - the route of a packet depends on the ARP reply
generated due to a previous packet.
2) Linux will fail to communicate with the vast majority of routers under
some, fairly basic, conditions.
	I'm certain that Cisco (for example) won't change their ways. I
can't blame them, either - no one else does it this way and there's no good
reason for doing it like this either.
	I think I'm going to give up at this point because I know I'm not
going to get anywhere. A simple static ARP entry will fix my problems,
although I'd prefer a more generic solution.
	Good luck!
		Richard
