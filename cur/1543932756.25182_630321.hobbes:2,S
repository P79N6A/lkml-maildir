thanks Roland - this is a really impressive set of cleanups 
generalizations!
Testing feedback: i've put the x86 and core bits into x86.git and your 
regset series has so far successfully passed a couple of hundred 
iterations of random-qa on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 as well. (with a few 
ptrace tests added to the mix as well) So it's all green as far as 
arch/x86 and core goes :-)
