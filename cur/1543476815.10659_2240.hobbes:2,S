Subject: 2.2.0pre6: SCSI aic7xxx fails detecting devices

My system is running fine with 2.0.37pre4 (RedHat 5.2),
but just for curiosity I tried to install 2.2.0pre6 on
my system (P166, Adaptec 2940 with BIOS 1.11).
When booting my system with the new kernel the SCSI driver
fails badly to detect the SCSI devices on my system.
(With 2.0.37pre4 I've no problems.)
It should print something like this on the screen
(that's what I get when booting 2.0.37pre4):
  scsi : 1 host.

  Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 6, lun 0
But instead it detects my "IBM DORS-32160" on SCSI id 1, 2, 3 and 4
(see below). Nothing is detected on id 0. The "IBM DCAS-34330" is not
detected at all (worse luck, my root partition is on that drive ;-)
so the kernel panics because it could not find anything to boot from.
  scsi : 1 host.

Another bug is:
If there's no cartridge in my "SyQuest SQ5110" (removable media drive)
the SCSI detection hangs until I insert a cartridge. If no cartridge is
in the drive, the kernel repeats every 5 seconds:
  scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 8, scsi0, channel 0,
         id 5, lun 0 Test Uni Ready 00 00 00 10 00
With 2.0.37pre4 it doesn't matter if I've a cartrigde in my
SyQuest drive or not (there's no boot partition on it... so it's
not really needed for booting).
My SCSI config is:
  #
  # SCSI support
  #
  CONFIG_SCSI=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y
  CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR=y
  CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG=y
  CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS=y
  CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING=y
  #
  # SCSI low-level drivers
  #
  CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX=y
  CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY=5
  (all other SCSI options are unset)
As I've read on this list, some other person had similar problems
with 2.2.0pre5. So I justed wanted to mention that this problem
still exists.
