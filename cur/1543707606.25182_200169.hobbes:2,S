I'm not sure.  I'm all for trimming the export list, but the real questions
are
	* does that export make sense?
	* does it impose extra restrictions on what we can do with core
code? (without breaking it, that is)
	* is it needed in the first place?  If it's redundant - to hell it
goes.
Note that majority of the exported symbols fail at least one of the above
and _that_ is why they should be killed.  Whether their users are GPL or
not doesn't matter - if they don't make sense, they must die, no matter
what b0rken code might be using them.
IMNSHO the questions above should be answered first and AFAICS they hadn't
been even discussed in that case.
