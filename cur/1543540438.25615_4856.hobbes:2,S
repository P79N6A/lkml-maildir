Background: I wrote "natsemi.c" in early May 1999, using a datasheet
spirited out of NatSemi.  They were supposed to be ready to release a
working chip to production in June '99, but later refused to say anything
about the schedule.  Given that the current chip is rev. C, I'm guessing
that things went badly.

What board are you using?  The FA-311?

The pci-scan code handles activating the card from ACPI D3 state (typically
caused by warm-booting from a Windows version that uses Wake-On-LAN),
enabling the memory and I/O regions, and setting the bus-master bit.
I'm guessing that the "teamF1" people didn't know the requirements.

I did note the lines at the bottom of the file matched my usual set-up,
especially in the earlier version (distributed by Netgear) which has the
compile lines verbatim.  Still, it appears that most of the driver source
lines were rewritten.
And I certainly wouldn't to take credit for the ugly macros or the calls to
     udelay(2000);
in the driver;->  (Yes, it's *much* easier to write a driver if you assume
that it's the only important code running on the machine.)

The norm for the proprietary world is "steal the code and hope no one
ever sees the code".  LynxOS and QNX have done it directly, as have
third-party VxWorks drivers.
