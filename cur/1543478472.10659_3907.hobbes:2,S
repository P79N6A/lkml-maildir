scsi0 in this case is the same card, with a hung insmod. This is a recently 
recompiled driver with verbose info. loaded with insmod -v aic7xxx.o -m -o 
newaic aic7xxx=verbose:0x1ffff.
Symptoms: machine locks at last line when compiled into the kernel proper. 
insmods hang in uninterruptible sleep. Occurs with 5.1.4 on a SMP 2.1.131-ac13,
5.1.6 on SMP 2.1.131-ac13, and 5.1.10 on SMP 2.2.0pre7-ac7.
Uniprocessor versions of 2.0.36 with 5.1.4, and 2.1.131-ac13 with 5.1.4 seem 
to work. The module loads at least.
Right now the SCSI bus is completely empty, just the card and cable to the 
external jack. I should have a CD burner soon to test more, but it looks like
it's some obscure thing having to do with SMP.
