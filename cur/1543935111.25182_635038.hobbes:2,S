Words don't say anything at all in isolation.  For example,
here the current tristate behavior has been documented for
several years now ... and that's the only thing that could
have conveyed any meaning whatever.
I can't agree that it's even slightly "necessary" to make
such a grutuitous and backwards-incompatible change.
