Hi,
I have a custom driver which works on Red Hat 7.2.
The same driver when compiled and inserted on Red Hat Advanced Server
(kernel 2.4.9 e-3) gives me the following unresolved symbol error
insmod sddlmadrv.o (This is the custom driver which works on 7.2)
sddlmadrv.o: unresolved symbol prefetch
Can anybody tell me what changes need to be done  so that the driver could
be inserted.
Thanks and Regards
Chandrasekhar
