We do not discriminate based on "end-user" or "developer", we  
discriminate based on productivity.  So far this thread has been  
extremely counterproductive and wasted a lot of my bandwidth and  
time.  As a result, I am now discriminating against you for wasting  
my time.  Welcome to my killfile.  (I still felt the need to point  
out your grievous logical errors, but don't bother replying because  
this is the last time I'm going to bother wasting time on this thread)

We do not care about your snazzy dev-model ideas, we have one that  
works for us.  We do not care about making things easier for  
commercial out-of-tree drivers, _end_ _of_ _story_.  Any arguments  
about that issue are just offtopic flames.

WRONG.  Driver maintenance is a 2-part effort.  The Linux kernel API  
is *not* stable for a lot of good reasons, and therefore the drivers  
must be in-tree to make it possible to fix drivers when we change the  
API.  Hardware companies are _expected_ to be good citizens and  
maintain their own drivers, fix bugs, etc.  If your driver sucks,  
nobody will buy your hardware to use on linux.

This is wrong.  There are a lot of companies that make great server  
hardware out there whose drivers are in the stock kernel, and by your  
argument "Linux will not sail to major servers unless a decent DDK  
exists", which is blatantly false.

Absolutely, and from the programmer point of view, that's all that  
matters.

This is the job of a distro

Community includes the people making the hardware

You don't want to upgrade, you don't get new hardware support, simple  
as that.  Upgrading my Debian testing between 2.6 versions has been  
really painless despite massive internal changes and restructuring,  
and Debian isn't really even a user-friendly distro.

As does my freedom to ignore you. Plonk.
