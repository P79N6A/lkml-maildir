[Sarcasm] Gee, sure, the GPL is much `freer' than BSD-like licences.
Depends what signification of `free' you choose to take.
The obligation to mention original developpers name is the only constraint
that BSD-like license forces on you... and not all of them at that.
... whereas the GPL has no constraints at all, that's well known. For
instance, I can take GPL code, do whatever I want with it, and redistribute
it whichever way I want, sure.
