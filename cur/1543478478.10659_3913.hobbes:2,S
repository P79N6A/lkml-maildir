Subject: new testing/pre-8 improves interactive performance

So I got the testing/pre-8 file again.  This time it contains the fix
that allows the use of locked buffers, and this improved performance a
lot.  
1. For example, I used netscape, played an mp3, and ran the command
'find / & wc /usr/X11R6/bin/* & wc /usr/X11R6/lib/* &' simultaneously. 
Netscape seemed just as interactive as normal, and the mp3 player didn't
skip for a while.  I think it skipped only because of a total I/O
bottleneck.
2.  Quake2 used to stop for a few seconds at a certain point in the
demo.  However, this has gone away completely, and many things seem
faster, such the shotgun and having multiple creatures on the screen. 
The frame rate is unaffected of course.
	Perhaps there should theoretically be some kind of "packet scheduling"
to keep write clustering from niced processes from using all I/O
bandwidth and starving foreground processes?  However, most of the
problems that I though were caused by this are now fixed.
