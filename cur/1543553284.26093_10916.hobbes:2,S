Look, if you have an axe to grind about RedHat, do it somewhere else.
If you are wondering why there is one compiler to build the kernel and
one compiler to build everything else, for Mandrake at least, the reason
is stability.  We never had problems with gcc 2.95.2+fixes for userland,
but there are isolated kernel cases in 2.2.x which still give us
problems.  Therefore, our standard kernel is built with egcs 1.1.2, and
we provide that compiler to our users so they can avoid the same
problems.
