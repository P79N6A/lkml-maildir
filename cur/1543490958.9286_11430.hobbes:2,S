hi!
we are planning a large oracle installation on 200+G database and a 4-way
SMP server. the application will employ 1-2 gbyte ram.
should i go fo linux on intel or is this way-too-large?
(whats up with raw devices on linux, there aren't any (for oracle) AFAIK?)
what's up with thruput on the intel (compaq?) vs. a sparc450?
pls. reply, 
paul witta
