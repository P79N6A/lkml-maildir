updatedb pushing out program data may be able to be improved on with drop 
behind or similar.
however another scenerio that causes a similar problem is when a user is 
busy useing one of the big memory hogs and then switches to another (think 
switching between openoffice and firefox)

you could make a synthetic test by writing a memory hog that allocates 3/4 
of your ram then pauses waiting for input and then randomly accesses the 
memory for a while (say randomly accessing 2x # of pages allocated) and 
then pausing again before repeating
run two of these, alternating which one is running at any one time. time 
how long it takes to do the random accesses.
the difference in this time should be a fair example of how much it would 
impact the user.
by the way, I've also seen comments on the Postgres performance mailing 
list about how slow linux is compared to other OS's in pulling data back 
in that's been pushed out to swap (not a factor on dedicated database 
machines, but a big factor on multi-purpose machines)

almost always true, however there is some amount of I/O that is free with 
todays drives (remember, they read the entire track into ram and then 
give you the sectors on the track that you asked for). and if you have a 
raid array this is even more true.
if you read one sector in from a raid5 array you have done all the same 
I/O that you would have to do to read in the entire stripe, but I don't 
believe that the current system will keep it all around if it exceeds the 
readahead limit.
so in many cases readahead may end up being significantly cheaper then you 
expect.
