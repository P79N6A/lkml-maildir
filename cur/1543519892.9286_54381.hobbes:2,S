If you are using the 3com driver then send a copy of the report to the 3com
folks.  Also try the 3c59x.c driver in the standard 2.2.x kernel. If both
give the same hang its probably some general kernel bug you are hitting, if
the other 3c59x works or at least fails differently then the hang is 
probably caused by the 3com driver, and my guess would be it doing a
disable_irq() while holding a lock used in the irq handler
