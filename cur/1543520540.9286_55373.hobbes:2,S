It's perfectly possible to do `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<root-device>' and
trash your system from root. Or you can do `chmod a+x /dev/<root-device>' and
non-privileged user will trash your system. Now what ? You had 1000 ways to
kill your system, not you have 1001 way. Big deal...

If root is dumb it's unfixable.

Do not do ramdisk more then size of physical RAM.

WHY seems it unacceptable to you ? That's the qyestion :-)
