	   I too like skip-list, the avg cost per ptr is low and
   things like merges are very easy, but when raw perf. is an issue a
   good RBtree impl usually kills a skip-list. I have and use both,
   but skip-list is almost never a better solution than an RBtree.
I guess I'm usually biased towards hashes because most of the problems
I care about (read as: socket demultiplex in the networking) requires
excellent insert/delete latencies.
What sort of properties do RB trees have for insert and delete?  Can
they be done in O(1) time like a hash insert/delete can?
Later,
