Well. I'm not surprised there are a few I couldn't find an SGML reference
for the linuxdoc dtd , or a tutorial when I wrote it, so I guessed by looking
at other documents and source code. 
I thought I'd checked the warnings

Did I really make it that messy?
I'm a little behind with bk pulling and it takes 2-3hours to do each pull
here, so I can't be sure until tomorrow .
but if the line number haven't changed...

Oops, there are errant <para> tag journal-api.tmpl line 211. Delete the line.

Hmm, can't see what these asre unless they are run-on errors form above.
Hang on. yup they seem to be.... , the trivial patch follows.
You also mentioned in private mail to me that you think there is
a requirement for BKL to be held on some journal calls. Could
someone else preferably part of the ext3 maintance team give me
cahpter and verse on this situationin 2.4 and 2.5 so I can
ensure the docs are correct, assuming they aren't already which is quite
likely since the docs were written by inspection of the ext3/jbd code 
and reading of various other docs avaliable (as mention in the sgml).
