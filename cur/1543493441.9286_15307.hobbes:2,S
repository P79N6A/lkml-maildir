I was looking to patch Linux to support > 2 Gig files, however Matti
Aarnio's patch that was on mea.tmt.tele.fi is currently unavailable.
Does anyone have a copy of this patch?  Also, I'm interested in
hearing if it has worked out successfully, and what was involved
enabling support for the large files in userspace code.
Please make sure to CC my email address, since I am not subscribed to
linux-kernel.
Thanks,
Vermont <vermont@gate.net>
PD
If there are other patches to accomplish the same goal, I'd be
interested in hearing about those, too.
