Thanks a lot Ken.
So pagecache lookup performance goes up about 15-25% in single threaded
tests on your P4s. Phew, I wasn't dreaming it.
It is a pity that ipf hasn't improved similarly (and even slowed down a
bit, if Jens' numbers are significant to that range). Next time I spend
some cycles on lockless pagecache, I'll try to scrounge an ipf and see
if I can't improve it (I don't expect miracles).
Thanks,
Nick
