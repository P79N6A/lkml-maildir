Note: I'm not saying that this means we _must_ implement the current
behaviour in leases. If CIFS allows the server to hand out read oplocks
when the client opened the file with a write share, then NFSv4 can
simply deal with the difference in semantics by just never requesting a
read lease in that situation.
That said, if CIFS has the same semantics as NFSv4, then why allow the
aberrant case?
