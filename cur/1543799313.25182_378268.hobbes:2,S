The 3 tries isn't to make sure that the registers didn't change, its to
make sure we actually successfully read all of the registers.  There are
10 tries to make sure the registers didn't change.  I doubt it will ever
take more than 2 or 3 so I don't see a problem with a limit of 10.
I *think* I understand you point, though.  You would prefer I not use
the smbus calls, correct?  If so, I disagree.  I think its better to use
the smbus calls b/c they're the most generic (read: will work with the
most i2c host ctlr drivers).  Perhaps Jean or someone else can make an
executive decision on this.

I understand but its an issue of being more generic.

I figured one of those was deprecated but didn't know which one.  I'll
change them.
