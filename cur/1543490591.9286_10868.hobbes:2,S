writing to a TCP/IP socket? gzip is used to compress the output of
`dump' and sending it over the net to the backup server.

I've been running the machine under load (no idling processor to raise 
it's temperature) from friday morning to monday morning wihout nay
problem. There was one backup run in this time (friday night) and
everything is okay. CBQ is not configured, so it shouldn't affect the
kernel.
