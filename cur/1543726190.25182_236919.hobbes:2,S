Hello everyone,
well, just out of curiosity (I wanted to play with reiser4) I've patched my 
2.6.7-mm7 tree; no rejects. But I get this:
*** Warning: "kallsyms_lookup" [fs/reiser4/reiser4.ko] undefined!
How do I get around that warning?
The patch was 
http://www.namesys.com/auto-snapshots/reiser4-2004.07.27-19.37-linux-2.6.7-mm7.diff.gz
Thanks in advance,
Norberto
