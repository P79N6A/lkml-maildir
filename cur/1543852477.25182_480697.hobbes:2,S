Greetings,
Just wanted to let you know I tested this patch 
http://people.debian.org/~vorlon/alpha-titan-video.patch
 on 2.6.18.2 sources 
and got the following errors during the compile.  The same 2.6.18.2 sources 
compile ok so I think this has something to do with the alpha-titan-video 
patch.  I hope this information is useful.  I do not know too much about 
debugging yet or I would have tried to provide more.
