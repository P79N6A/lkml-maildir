For the record, I wasn't happy about adding FUTEX_REQUEUE to optimize
for suboptimal apps using the horrid pthreads interface, but I
understand the benchmarking realities.
I'm certainly way less than thrilled to discover that it doesn't work,
and we need to implement FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE, and of course can't get rid
of FUTEX_REQUEUE.
The base futex concept and interface is simple (although the
implementation w/ the Linux mm subsystem proved interesting in the
corner cases); it's increasingly becoming a horror with these kind of
hacks.
