Yes, net/core/utils.c, net_ratelimit() function is used to determine
if messages should be printed or suppressed.  It returns 1 if the
message should be printed, 0 to suppress a message.  Usage is like this:
	if (net_ratelimit())	/* print if non-0 */
		printk(KERN_DEBUG "printing some message\n");
If you want to print all messages (!) and you aren't worried about
DoS or overflowing logs etc., just change the net_ratelimit() function
to return 1 always... and stand back.  Warning, caveat emptor, user beware,
etc.  Void where prohibited.
