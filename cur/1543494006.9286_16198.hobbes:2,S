Subject: mapping user memory to kernel space (another porting question)

Background: I'm porting a somewhat complex embedded system
to the linux kernel. I'm trying to do this as a set of
kernel modules to avoid requiring modifications to the
linux kernel.
Right now I'm running into the following problem: given an
arbitrary buffer in a user's address space, I must wire it
down to prevent paging and access it from the kernel. I can
accomplish the former with mlock(), but I am having trouble
figuring out how to accomplish the latter. It seems that I
should call get_vm_area() to allocate a range in the kernel's
address space, then some incantation involving alloc_area_pmd()
and/or alloc_area_pte() along with set_pgdir() to insert the
correct mappings, which I extract with pmd_offset() and
pte_offset(). Unfortunately, get_vm_area() is not exported
to modules, and I cannot find any other set of interfaces which
seem like they would do what I want. I've tried reading various
bits of documentation, but everything I've found assumes that
I have a contiguous set of physical pages to remap, and so
ioremap() will do what I want. Since the user's buffer may span
an arbitrary set of non-physically-contiguous pages, that solution
doesn't work for me.
As before, any thoughts, suggestions, pointers, etc would be
greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
