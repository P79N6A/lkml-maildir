This is a passively cooled notebook, so there's no fan
to control.  They probably self-limit the CPU speed when
the temperature gets high to prevent meltdown of the drive.
But I would like to raise the lower limit if possible,
allowing the speed to bump back up at, say 58C rather
than waiting for 52C as it currently does.
