I noticed the problem originally with another program (playback of 720p 
video to remote X using mplayer). And in my case the CPU usage is 2-3% 
systime, <1% userspace so it doesn't seem to be anything to do with the 
scheduler (I did try that "echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_compat_yield" 
workaround, too.)
