I don't see the point of requiring all clocks to have a clockdomain field.
Given that we have virtual clocks, it is quite reasonable for some clocks
not to have a clock domain associated with them.
The overhead for avoiding this requirement isn't that great, and I feel
that there's little benefit from this change.
