That's most likely because printk() handles neither special chars nor
special fun (like ANSI color and movement codes). Hence, we should be
safe should there be spurious utf8 output on the console (which is
most likely 8-bit before userspace switches it to utf-8).

(Well, and convert all the MODULE_AUTHORs to utf-8)
