Greg,
Could you please drop these patches for a while? Or maybe just don't
push them to Linus yet. The reason is that I want to change
input_allocate_device to take bitmap of supported events. This way I
could allocate ABS tables dynamically at the same time I allocate
input_dev itself and it will simplify error handling logic in drivers
and it will save I think 1260 bytes per input_dev structure which is
nice. And I don't want to go through all subsystems yet again soI want
to fold into my input dynalloc patch...

That's fine with me.
