 Well, I wasn't talking about 66Mhz nor about 64bit cards but rather 
 normal consumer cards which are specified for 33Mhz.

 Trying to enhance a systems performance by overclocking the bus is
 about the most stupid thing one can do as one ANY of the connected
 devices memory/CPU/chipset/PCI devices/AGP cards (just to name a
 few) have a high probability of failing and all those probabilites
 factor up which basically means that the system is in a unpredictable
 state which is never acceptable for any serious kind of system. 
 Better leave the overclocking of busses to kids who are bored
 by their live.
