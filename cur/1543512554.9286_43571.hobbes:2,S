You don't need many devices.  You can easily chew up tens of kilobytes

This seems to be a standing issue of yours, yet there is never any
explanation of why this is a bad thing, at least not on the scale we're
currently discussing.  I get the feeling that it just looks messy, and
that that offends you.  Anyhow, as part of my "supermodule" proposal, I
am trying to separate out probing code for the rather few remaining
busses that need it - non-PnP ISA and what else?

The kernel has to be notified *anyway* when the partition table changes,
so it is perfectly capable of invoking the notification mechanism.  Not
an issue.

I disagree that it is a significant difference.

Of course.  But the point is that I consider devfs to be dead weight

But you're still trying to require that the virtual filesystem exists. 
You're building your system around devfs, instead around the daemon, or
the interface, which is what I object to.  It means you need to expand
all the trees, etc, etc, in kernel space yet.  I think we're relatively
close, but not close enough.
