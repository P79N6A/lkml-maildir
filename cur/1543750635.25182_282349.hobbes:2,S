This is a nice reference, thanks for the info (I personally only worked
with ev6 so I probably never run in the exact features and history of
the older chips).
All issues with ev4+smp/preempt and ev5+smp/preempt should be fixed with
the two incremental patches I posted last week that make PF_MEMDIE a
TIF_MEMDIE and used_math a PF_USED_MATH and that fixes the PF_MEMDIE
race that existed on all archs in mainline 2.6 and that AFIK Wli even
managed to reproduce once.
