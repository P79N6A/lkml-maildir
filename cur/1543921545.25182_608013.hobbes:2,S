Hello,
I realized that I did not fix one of the cases where this bug manifests
in my last patch. Here is the complete patch to fix the issue. And this
time I cc'ed the relevant people.
Have a good one,
Igor H.
# This patch fixes a memory corruption bug in the s390 dcssblk driver.
# The bug occurs when an attempt to change the type of a segment
# returns an error. At this point the driver tries to remove the segment in
# question while some of the device's attributes are in use. This causes the
# driver to hang.
