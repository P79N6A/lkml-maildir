Its stuck in following .. 
                while ((loops_per_jiffy <<= 1) != 0) {
                        /* wait for "start of" clock tick */
                        ticks = jiffies;
                        while (ticks == jiffies)
                                /* nothing */;
                        /* Go .. */
                        ticks = jiffies;
                        __delay(loops_per_jiffy);
                        ticks = jiffies - ticks;
                        if (ticks)
                                break;
                }
Its stuck in (tight loop)
	while (ticks == jiffies)
                   /* nothing */;
I have no idea, what this code is supposed to be doing :(
Let me know, what I can do for you.
Thanks,
Badari
