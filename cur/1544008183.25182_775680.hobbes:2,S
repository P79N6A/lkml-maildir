Subject: [patch 2.6.28-rc7] regulator: catch some registration errors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: David Brownell <dbrownell@users.sourceforge.net>
Prevent registration of duplicate "struct regulator" names.
They'd be unavailable, and clearly indicate something wrong.
Also make sure the consumer device is provided.  It's nonsensical
to omit these, and not a documented part of the interface.  Since
no code in mainline does such stuff, this is just anti-oops medicine.
