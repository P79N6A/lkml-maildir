I agree.  People doing a tcpdump don't have to turn on promiscuous
mode, that's what the -p option is for.  In other words, having
promiscuous mode disable VLAN filtering does not take away the
user's options at all.
In fact, the very definition of promiscuous is to turn off hardware
filtering, albeit the filtering of MAC addresses rather than VLAN
tags.  So it would seem logical to have it turn off VLAN filtering
too.
Cheers,
