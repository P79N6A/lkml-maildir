Hi,
I'm working on a tool that can display information of a computer's 
hardware. For this I want to parse the SMBIOS-Structure. I know that I 
could search /proc/kcore for the "_SM_" eyecatcher, but I wonder if 
there is a "easier" way to get the information (so the tool don't have 
to run setuid-root).
Is there a way? 
Thank you in advance and have a nice weekend,
  Michael
