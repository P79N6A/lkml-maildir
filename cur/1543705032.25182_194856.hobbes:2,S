[PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Better reporting of PCI frequency / bus mode problems for acpi driver
When plugging a 33MHz card into a bus that's running at 66MHz, I'd like
to see a better error message than:
acpiphp_glue: notify_handler: unknown event type 0x5 for \_SB_.SBA0.PCI4.S2F0
The following patch would give us:
Device \_SB_.SBA0.PCI4.S2F0 cannot be configured due to a frequency mismatch
which I think is clearer.
