If filesystems need to be able to change the value of f_mapping, then
yes, however if none of the potential users of lookup_instantiate_filp()
care about doing so, then we can get rid of it.
I don't care either way since we will not be supporting non-intent based
opens for NFSv4.

It is non-portable and it was never supported on NFSv4 anyway. If
someone cares, they can fix it, but I don't see much need.

Agreed.
