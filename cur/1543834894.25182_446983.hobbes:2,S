Please read the footer of the KLive pages:
"The use of the information and of the software in this website is at
 your own risk.  KLive probably doesn't represent a reliable sample of
 the real usage of the Linux Kernel."
Said that pretending that KLive data has absolutely no significance at
all and that you can't draw any conclusion at all from it, to me seems
as wrong as pretending it to perfect.
