Not to seem heartless, but it does work from 2.4, you may have to stick
with that till someone ports the driver forward.  Linux remains a
volunteer effort.  The kernel maintainers do not have a card to develop
against, and they don't need the hardware.  If no one else does either,
then the card becomes un-updated.   I would recommend finding people who
use the card, and trying to get some support for updating it.
have a nice day,
