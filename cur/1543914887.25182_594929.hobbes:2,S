Although it's true the code is not yet upstream...
Given that we want support for Atheros (whenever all this mess is 
sorted), I think it's quite fair to discuss these issues [in a calm, 
rational, paranoia-free manner] on LKML or linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org.

Given that we want it upstream, it is however relevant.  We want to make 
sure we are aware of copyright problems, and we want to make sure any 
copyright problems are fixed.
On a side note:  "MadWifi" does not really describe the Linux ath5k 
driver, the driver at issue here.  Some mistakes were made by Linux 
wireless developers, and those mistakes were corrected.

Amen.  100% agreed.
