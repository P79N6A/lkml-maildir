  Large organizations like to standardize things wherever possible.
  Given an OS that is well suited for a fairly secure environment
that also runs widely-available office software, they will adopt it
for both uses, thus locking out other operating systems.
  Many of these decisions are made by Dumb White Guys sitting around
a boardroom table looking at feature lists, and pushed by even dumber
3-letter consulting firms whose technical representatives say things
like "Yes, we will be decrypting all SSL sessions at the firewall to
check for viruses."
  So I think Linux needs these 'fringe' features if it's going to
continue to expand its user base in the face of such stupidity.
