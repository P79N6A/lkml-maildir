				AAARRRGGGHHH.
Whatever, it's a known problem with a history of at about three months.
The last message seems to be the maintainer saying that he has a patch
ready and will send to Jeff.  I've no idea if that actually happened or
not.
I'm going to suggest that it gets marked as a broken and unmaintained
driver, or I'm going to bypass the maintainers and submit an _untested_
fix directly to Andrew/Linus.  I don't want to do either, but...
