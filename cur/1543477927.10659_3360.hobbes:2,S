Oh, that is a bug. Both DOS 6.22 and NT 4sp3 are happy with 0xf6.
They can read and write 0xf6 in any character position, unlike Linux.
I'd guess the 0xf6 bug is a leftover from Atari DOS support.
The IS_FREE stuff would need to test for Atari format perhaps.
Note that 0x05 is only legal as a substitute for 0x05 in the first
character slot. To save code, Linux could unconditionally translate
when reading.
On a read, NT does translation only for the first character.
A manually created file with "\05\05-E-5" on disk will be displayed
as "\xe5\05-E-5", but will not be accessible by any name.
Clearly 0x05 must never appear in the short name except at the
beginning as a substitute for 0xe5. NT can create and use a file
with 0x05 anywhere by using the long name and '_' for mangling.
