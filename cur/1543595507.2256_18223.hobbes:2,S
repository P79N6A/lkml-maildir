Interesting but I wonder how much this helps someone that not already know what it is. Should not the ls manual also contain something that explains the meaning instead of just the mapping from bits to symbol.
Do linux even support the sticky bit (t) I can't see a reason to use it, why would I want the file to be stored in the swap ?? 
Also I think S (setuid but no execute bit) have something to do with file locking but I'am not shure exactly how it works.
