For my application, this long of a delay results in data loss.  The e1000_update_stats() function is broken down into 3 main operations:

In order to reduce the amount of time spent with interrupts disabled I separated the register reads from updating adapter->stat counters.  The register reads take up the bulk of the 57 usec and shouldn't require protection (I could be wrong).  The new operation looks like this and reduces the amount of time spent with interrupts turned off by 1/2:

not per se, I think you did the right thing here. I think it might even be safe to
move the PHY reads outside the spinlock area, and this is certainly something I
would like to try.
would you care to send an RFC patch to netdev@vger.kernel.org?
Also, I notice you are using an old driver/kernel. care to retest against the
latest git trees?
I'll certainly take your suggestion and have it tested.
