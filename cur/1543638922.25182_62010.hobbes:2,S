Yeah, this should be fixed. unregister_netdevice() sleeps under rtnl_lock().
Which means that any other activity that needs this lock will be blocked.
Dave, how about this

We don't have to hold rtnl look while sleeping. Device is already unlinked
from the list so nobody can grab and bump refcount.

It'd be nice to trace what part of the kernel is actually holding refcount.

:) No, the point of device destructors is not to hide kernel bugs.

That why it's important to trace and fix the subsystem that is holding devices
for a long time after deregistration. I may very well be doing it for a 
good reason
but warning is helpful anyway.
And we should fix sleep in unregister_netdevice() (ie patch above).
