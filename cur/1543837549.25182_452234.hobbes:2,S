If you look closely you'll see that the patch already adds a new
entry to MAINTAINERS.
I put the the driver in drivers/acpi/ because it relies heavily on the
ACPI EC stuff. But OK, what is a better place for the driver? 
drivers/char/ 
  It doesn't even register any character device.
drivers/video/backlight/
  It doesn't just do backlight control.
drivers/misc/
  Seems to be the last resort for everything that doesn't fit it
  otherwise.
Unless anyone has a better idea I will move it to drivers/misc/, then.

It already does exactly that, you can find the backlight class driver
in /sys/class/backlight/s270/.
I cannot map the "automatic brightness control" feature to the
backlight class driver, that's why I duplicated the brightness stuff
in /proc/acpi/s270/.

What are those "generic" places? I cannot think of any besides a
"platform" device.

Ok, I will move the /proc/acpi/s270/ stuff to a sysfs platform device,
then. I will cook up another patch shortly.
Any ideas on that ec_transaction() patch I sent earlier?
