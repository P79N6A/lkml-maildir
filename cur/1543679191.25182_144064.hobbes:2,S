Hmmm... the joys of no documentation....
Can you
  grab  
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/D800/mouseplay.c
  compile it
  boot into a 2.4 kernel
  Disable gpm and get out of X
  run mouseplay capturing the output 
    e.g. mouseplay | tee /tmp/m.out
  perform various mouse action, particularly the buttons
  annotate /tmp/m.out to tell me what you did when,
  send m.out to me.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
