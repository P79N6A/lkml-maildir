You assume all addresses following the primary addresses are secondary
addresses of the primary, which is not true with multiple primaries.
This patch (untested) makes sure only to send notification for real
secondaries of the deleted address. It also removes a racy double-
check for IN_DEV_PROMOTE_SECONDARIES - once we've decided to promote
an address checking again opens a window in which address promotion
could be disabled and we end up with only secondaries without a
primary address.
