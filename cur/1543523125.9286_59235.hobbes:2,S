I knew that I wanted to say something else about this...You are assuming that the only
important web server is one that is accessed over the Internet via a slow dialup
connection.  While that may be so now, and certainly was moreso earlier, it is only
becoming less true.
With things such as cable modem, DSL and high-speed wireless connections, as well as
the growing importance of intranet servers, the common case in the near future will be
lots of fast connections, not slow ones.  Now all we need to do is be able to measure
performance on both scenarios and I think we'll be doing much better.
