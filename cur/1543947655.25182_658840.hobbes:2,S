Subject: [PATCH 00/10] CGroup API files: Various cleanup to CGroup control files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patchset is a roll-up of the non-contraversial items of the
various patches that I've sent out recently, fixed according to the
feedback received.
In summary they are:
- general rename of read_uint/write_uint to read_u64/write_u64
- use these methods for cpusets and memory controller files
- add a read_map cgroup file method, and use it in the memory
  controller
- move the "releasable" control file to the debug subsystem
- make the debug subsystem config option default to "n"
The only user-visible changes are the movement of the "releasable"
file and the fact that some write_u64()-based control files are now
more forgiving of additional whitespace at the end of their input.
