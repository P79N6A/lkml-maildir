You can use the realtime LSM (see list archives) to let specific groups
of users use mlockall and run RT tasks.  Just load it like:
modprobe realtime gid=29
and make gid 29 your "cdrecord" group.
This should make CD burning as joeuser reliable as root.  Most people
use this for low latency audio but I think cd burning is a wider and
completely unexplored application.
