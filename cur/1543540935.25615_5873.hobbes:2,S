I'm still convinced that this global, adjustable mlock limit is needed:
something like this:
        if (locked > (mlockable_pages) )
                goto out;
if the user (root) REALLY want  to mlock all memory (and risk a crash) ,
he can set mlockable_pages = num_physpages  ,
but the default of this value should be something like:
on boxes with <= 16MB RAM:  mlockable_pages = num_physpages * 3/4
on boxes with > 16MB RAM: mlockable_pages = num_physpages - 8MB
That way the 256MB RAM box will be able to mlock up to 248MB as default.
(having a 8MB saefty zone) , but if he really wants to use up all memory
he can even lift this limit, but he has to know what he is doing.
Does the above make sense ?
But since in my case (RT audio apps using large amounts of phys mem),
this mlock() issue is tigthly connected to the lowlatency issue,
and lowlatency performance will not make its way into the mainstream
kernel until 2.6,  we will have to provide a patched kernel anyway.
Therefore we add our own mlock() limits to suit our needs,
but I think other apps can benefit from large mlocked areas too.
