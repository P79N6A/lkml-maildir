I am told that the gcc people realized that was indeed a bug (people were 
able to show problems even in non-threaded environments with mprotect()), 
and have now fixed it in the current gcc sources. That still leaves the 
old versions with potential problems, but I think it makes it much less 
interesting to audit for these things.
