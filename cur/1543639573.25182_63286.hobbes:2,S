   SMP, these functions are going to die, nowadays they still work on UP, but
   they, AFAIK, will be nuked. In this specific case I have already merged a
   fix with DaveM, wait for 2.5.32 8) They now use BR_NETPROTO_LOCK and use
   the new LLC.
Yes, and this work actually did get pushed to Linus but he dropped
it.  No biggie, I'll repush and we'll hopefully see it in 2.5.32
