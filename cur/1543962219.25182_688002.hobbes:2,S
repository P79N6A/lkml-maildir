Ingo,
I have a few questions regarding  this code in kernel/sched.c
static unsigned long
calc_delta_mine(unsigned long delta_exec, unsigned long weight,
         struct load_weight *lw)
{
     u64 tmp;
     if (unlikely(!lw->inv_weight))
         lw->inv_weight = (WMULT_CONST-lw->weight/2) / (lw->weight+1);
Q1) This code is hit often in scenarios I run, is this really unlikely for 
others?
Q2) The rest of the code in sched.c seems to make inv_weight == 
WMULT_CONST/weight and I was wondering if you could explain why this 
instance is different.
Q3) That division is pretty expensive, could we sacrifice some accuracy and 
do a precompute table?  Do you have another idea how we could get rid of 
the divide?
