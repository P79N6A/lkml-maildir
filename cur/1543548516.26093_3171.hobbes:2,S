Hi Jeff,
since I vaguely remember an email from you describing how
you spent <large amount of time> tweaking and changing
the disk IO elevator in Netware, and since we might want
to improve the Linux elevator sort a bit, could you give
us some hints on what to do and where not to waste our
time? ;)
thanks,
Rik
