pepiex doesn't build for me, I was actually trying that already. It tries to
take over pthreads, which I think breaks. PAPI does look nice though.

Ah, cool - seems to have bitrotted somewhat, perfctr_*_event_* appear no
longer to exist in perfctr 2.7.3.
In any case, your manpage inspired some command lines that at least appear
to generate numbers, thanks.
But we're obviously not there yet.
