Hello !
Can someone tell me, how md multipathing works, when a drive fails
completly ?
Does this only work with raid-autodetection ?
When no autodetection is done and a drive is missing, would a raidstart
kill the raid, since the drives are now available with other devices (sda
instead of former sdb...) ?
