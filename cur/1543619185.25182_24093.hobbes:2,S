Calm down guys.  Al, Daniel, peace.
It was fun while people were just ragging on me (it tends to happen about
every 6 months or so, and I have a thick skin - and every time it happens
some problems do get unearthed and that's fine), but let's not make this
degenerate into a real hate-fest..
Shake hands, please.
-- tangential --
One thing intrigued me in this thread - which was not the discussion
itself, but the fact that Rik is using bitkeeper.
How many other people are actually using bitkeeper already for the kernel?
I know the ppc guys have, for a long time, but who else is? bk, unlike
CVS, should at least be _able_ to handle a "network of people" kind of
approach.
