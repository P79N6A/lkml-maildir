The patch assumed some whitespace cleanups earlier in the ext4 patch
queue, which is probably why you had to apply the patch by hand.
Thanks for trying it out!!
May I add:
Tested-by: Andreas Sundstrom <sunkan@zappa.cx>
To the patch commit log?  We've been trying trying to give credit to
those people who work with kernel developers to test fixes, but given
that it does add peoples' e-mail addresses, it's something I always
ask permission to do if that person hasn't agreed to this sort of
thing already.
Thanks again,
