AFAICS, they started with storage-class-like attributes.  Consider e.g.
always_inline or section; these are not qualifiers at all and you want
to have
static __attribute__((always_inline)) int foo(int *p);
interpreted with attribute applied to foo, not to its return type.
So they have fsckloads of existing code relying on that parsing.  BTW,
they want things like
int *p __attribute__((section(...)))
and that's a position where qualifiers just do not appear.  Again, existing
codebase (and quite a bit of that is present in the kernel, BTW).
I rather doubt that they'll be able to kill that off and making parsing
dependent on the nature of attribute is not a viable option either -
think of __attribute__((this,that)) where "this" is storage-class-like
and "that" - qualifier-like.
