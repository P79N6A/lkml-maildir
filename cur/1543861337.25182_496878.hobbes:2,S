I have one trivial idea : would it help to use 2 addresses to server data,
one for pure kernel usage (eg: git, rsync) and one with other stuff such
as DVDs, but with a low limit on the number of concurrent connections ?

I often have this problem on some of my machines after slocate runs.
Everything is consumed in dcache/icache and no data blocks are cacheable
anymore. I never found a way to tell the kernel to assign a higher prio
to data than to [di]cache. To remedy this, I wrote this stupid program that
I run when I need to free memory. It does simply allocate the memory size
I ask, which causes a flush of the [di]caches, and when it exits, this
memory is usable again for data blocks. 
I'm not sure it would be easy to automatically run such a thing, but
maybe it could sometimes help when the [id]caches are too fat.
