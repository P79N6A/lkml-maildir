That would suit.  One needs to be quite careful about killing everything
off in the close->rmmod side of things, especially if the delayed work
handler re-arms itself.  We have a pending (and possibly executing) timer
handler to worry about, then a pending (and possibly executing) keventd
handler to worry about.
We've got this cancel_rearming_delayed_work() thing - I was never terribly
happy about it, but I think it works.
