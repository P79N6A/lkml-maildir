What we need to ensure is that the parent device is kept at least until
all children, grandchildren and so on are done with their uevent needs.
This would imply it needed to stay as long as those children,
grandchildren, ... are still registered. Would it be save to suggest
that a ->remove callback would always need to unregister the children?
Then putting the parent reference at the end of kobject_del() (which is
after kobject_uevent() in kobject_unregister()) should be safe.
