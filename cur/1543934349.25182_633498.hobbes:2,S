    FYI - this specific card was sold as "4-SATA" channels.  There were
other contemporary (same package design) Promise cards offered that
were advertised to 1) support 2-sata+2pata or 2) support RAID w/SATA.
I think there was also a RAID card supporting PATA-only as well.
    It is quite possible (though thoroughly 'lame'), that they have 1
card providing, both 4 SATA and 4 PATA, but only provide the connectors
for some subset, with the RAID being a firmware-only (software-only)
option that is implemented in software on the card (as my web searching
indicated was true for some Promise SATA cards). 
    Perhaps an "RFE" for hdparm might be someway to specify the
target device by using a label on one of the devices partitions, since
my boot-time hdparm settings suffer from the same problems my
/etc/fstab used to suffer before "labels" were available.
