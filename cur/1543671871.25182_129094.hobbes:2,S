What would the kernel be locked while waiting on disk I/O?  Shouldn't it 
be running another process?  It's not DOING anything.  The whole idea 
behind a multitasking OS is to overlap the I/O of one process with the 
CPU usage of another whenever possible.  Swapping is an I/O operation.
And for that matter, if every runnable process has pages swapped out so 
that they cannot run, then the CPU should be IDLE.
Am I wrong?

The process got that large because of a bug in my program.  But a 
side-effect of that was kernel behavior that didn't make sense to me.  I 
decided to ask about it.
