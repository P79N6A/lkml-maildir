it's very simple, just gcc and run it from console, I guess you should 
quit X before running it, ctrl-c to exit:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int main(void)
{
   unsigned char buf[10];
   unsigned char last;
   unsigned long counter = 0;
   int fd = open("/dev/psaux", O_RDONLY);
   if(fd == -1) { perror("couldn't open file"); exit(1); }
   while(read(fd, buf, 1) != -1) {
     if( (last == 0) && (buf[0] != 0) ) {
       printf("\n[%010d] ", counter);
     }
     printf("[%03d] ", buf[0]);
     last = buf[0];
     counter++;
   }
   return 0;
}
/* eof */
