while we are at it.... could you briefly help me describe the 'code
sequence' involved in the naming of an interface ? with it we could
write a small doc...
for instance I'm tracking tg3.c code as:
 alloc_etherdev()
 --> sets net_device->name="eth%d"
 register_netdev()
 --> register_netdevice()
      --> netdev_register_sysfs(struct net_device *net)
           struct device *dev = &(net->dev)
           dev->class = &net_class
           --> device_add(dev)
here I stopped... but I guess that device_add builds and event for udev.
anyway, on my system it produces such a sysfs device:
$> udevinfo  -p /sys/class/net/__tmp1930643048 -a
  looking at device '/class/net/__tmp1930643048':
    KERNEL=="__tmp1930643048"
    SUBSYSTEM=="net"
    SYSFS{weight}=="64"
    SYSFS{tx_queue_len}=="1000"
    SYSFS{flags}=="0x1002"
    SYSFS{mtu}=="1500"
    SYSFS{operstate}=="down"
    SYSFS{broadcast}=="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"
    SYSFS{address}=="00:04:23:ca:bc:cb"
    SYSFS{link_mode}=="0"
    SYSFS{type}=="1"
    SYSFS{features}=="0x113a9"
    SYSFS{ifindex}=="5"
    SYSFS{iflink}=="5"
    SYSFS{addr_len}=="6"

yes, it's FC6.

seems like HWADDR is incompatible with bonding.... there is some
message using HWADDR as well as MASTER=bond0 and SLAVE=yes.
