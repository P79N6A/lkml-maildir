It never advised me before seeing problems in the kernel (I had about 5 
drives dying running Linux machines).
It should be trivial to just grep the kernel log for the error and mail it 
to some address. 
Another way to prove a dead drive is (after a backup) to drop it some 
until it made a nice broken drive sound (a very high pitch shriek) and 
bring it to the store that sold it to you (ideally a small one as they are 
less technically challenged then big chains).
