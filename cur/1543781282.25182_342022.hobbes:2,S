Well there is now, and that is we are now using a bit in the 2nd
byte as flags. So I had to do away with -ve numbers there entirely.
You could achieve a similar thing by using another bit in that byte
#define VM_FAULT_FAILED 0x20
and make that bit present in VM_FAULT_OOM and VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, then
do an unlikely test for that bit in your handler and branch away to
the slow path.
