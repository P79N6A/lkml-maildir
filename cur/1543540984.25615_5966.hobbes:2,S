Hi,
Was playing to get this SCSI working, I discovered it is very good at
hanging this system :-))
Linux 2.2.16
ncr53c400 (ncr8380) driver
When specifying the IO adress and IRQ, the system gives :
scsi0: SCSI bus busy, waiting up to 5 seconds
scsi0: bus busy, attempting abort
Then the system hangs. I can CTRL-ALT-DEL for an immediate reboot, but I
didn't get the card working..
Anyone any hints / way to debug this ?
	Regards,
		Igmar
