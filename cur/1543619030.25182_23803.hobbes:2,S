What the hell does "fair" have to do with anything? Should we cut you some 
slack because you use Outlook? "Oh, he uses Outlook. Don't be so hard on 
him. He didn't *mean* to send everyone in his contact list a trojan that 
formatted our hard drives."
I don't think it's "fair" to have to pay for bandwidth being pissed away by 
Microsoft Outlook users. Maybe I should start submitting invoices to all of 
the people who sent me malicious apps via Outlook.
Microsoft Outlook *IS* the problem. Blaming it *IS* correct. Removing 
Outlook *IS* the solution.
If I were you, I'd stop using that pile of crap and start using something 
more secure, before you become the target of some luser script kiddie that 
wants to borrow your computer to take down Internet services that we all 
enjoy.....

That's hardly fair.  Some of us use Outlook for a reason (my address is a
