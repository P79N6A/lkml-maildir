You replied to the second message in the thread (which contains the
second patch).  The first message contains the first patch.  lkml.org
has it archived if you need it.

And I now have 20 messages from verizon to postmaster / abuse requesting
that I go and fill in their "ISP" whitelist form... one to each would
have done, but 10 times as much?  That's definitely abuse in itself.
On this ISP whitelist form, Verizon require a phonenumber that they can
call anytime during some random timezone (CST, where ever that is.)
Being located in the UK, that's not acceptable so I'm unable to comply
with their requirements for whitelisting.  Sorry.
