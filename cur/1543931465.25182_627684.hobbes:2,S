No. The line concerning partitions will display different data. The new format match the current format

Current partition format:
major minor name reads_issued sectors_read writes_issued sectors_written
New partition format (current disk format):
major minor name reads_issued reads_merged sector_read ms_reading writes_completed writes_merged sectors_written ms_writing I/Os_running ms_I/O weighted_ms_I/O
