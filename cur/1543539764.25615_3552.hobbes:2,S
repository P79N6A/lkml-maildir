That "disk-destroyer" just overwrites the partition table, something that
can be done in many easier ways. No real proof of the existence of the
mythical DISK2BRICK ATA command (that would in any case work only for
certain brands/models) that would make all this a real threat has
been put forward. No Windows/DOS virus/troyan has made use of this
mythology either (and there _have_ been instances of destroyed hardware, or
close enough, in recent history).
