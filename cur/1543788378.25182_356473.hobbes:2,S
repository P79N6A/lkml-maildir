The latest changes to the 2.6.14-rc3-rt10 patch is to make robust and
priority inheritance independent.  The code now supports mutexes
that are robust or priority inheriting or both.
I hope to have glibc patches out soon for the new separation of 
robustness
and priority inheritance.
David
Please note that robust mutexes works with other flavors of kernel 
besides
realtime.  The code works with all flavors of kernel,  PREEMPT_NONE,  
PREEMPT_DESKTOP or PREEMPT_RT.
