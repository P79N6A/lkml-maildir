If you tell me the kernel version and patches to apply which you want 
tested, and what options to run cerberus with (never used it before...), I 
have control over a currently idle dual Athlon MP 2000+ with an AMD-768 
(rev 04) IDE controller and 3G of RAM. It has only one HD, a ST340810A 
(ATA-100, 37G) attached.
btw. Is this where I get cerberus from?
         
http://sourceforge.net/projects/va-ctcs/
The machine won't be in use for a few more weeks (until I find the time to 
configure all the software and the database server it will be connecting 
to...) so I can do tests during that period.
Best regards,
         Anton
