That's the model, yes. I'm not saying it ever happens in practice, but
things like halts, f00f bugs, software emulation, etc., might in theory
come into play with a given processor's cache coherency scheme.

True for all the processors we're currently working with. Linus talks
about assuming a 'sane architecture' as the common core and making ports
minimal variations from that. Currently write ordering is one of those
things considered sane.

In theory, yes. Not today probably, but on faster machines where the
number of cycles to perform a syscall compares a little more favorably to
the inter-processor latency.. 
And it'll definitely be an issue on NUMA machines.
