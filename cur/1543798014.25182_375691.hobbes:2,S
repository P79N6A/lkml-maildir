if a working platform configuration configuration requires 
CONFIG_BROKEN=y, the problem is a bug that should be fixed properly.
We are talking about a class of bugs that can usually be easily fixed if 
reported - so why aren't they reported?
The MTD_SHARP case is a good example, because otherwise I might have 
soon sent a patch that would have removed this driver with the rationale
"both marked as obsolete and BROKEN can clearly be removed".

Unless someone can tell me a valid case for enabling BROKEN that does 
both create a working configuration and not hide real issues it seems 
the approch below might be the way to go.
Yes, you might dislike this at the first sight.
But if you consider that although this might result in a short-term 
breakage of some configurations, this will also result in proper bug 
reports and fixing of the wrong BROKEN dependency bugs, I hope you agree 
that this will actually improve the situation.

Do not allow people to create configurations with CONFIG_BROKEN=y.
The sole reason for CONFIG_BROKEN=y would be if you are working on 
fixing a broken driver, but in this case editing the Kconfig file is 
trivial.
Never ever should a user enable CONFIG_BROKEN.
