IIRC a long time ago there was a change in the scheduler to prevent a 
low prio task running on a sibling of a hyperthreaded processor to slow 
down a higher prio task on another sibling of the same processor.
Basically the scheduler would put the low prio task to sleep during an 
adequate task slice to allow the other sibling to run at full speed for 
a while.
I don't know the scheduler code well enough, but comments like this one 
make me think that the change is still in place:

If that is the case, turning off CONFIG_SCHED_SMT would solve the problem.
