That's not going to help.  As Richard said, the memory in question
belongs to the called function.  GCC knows this.  It can freely modify
it.  The fact that the value of the parameter is const is a
language-level, semantic thing.  It doesn't say anything about the
const-ness of that memory.  Only the ABI does.
