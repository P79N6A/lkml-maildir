Linus et al:
My name is <USER>, and I've been using Linux for <TIME PERIOD>, ever
since version <OLD VERSION>.
I've just upgraded to 2.2.0, and it works marvelously on my <RANDOM
MACHINE>, even though it only has <LIMITED RESOURCES> and <RANDOM OLD
PERIPHERALS>.
Thank you so much for all your hard work.  I look forward to
<FUTURE VERSIONS> and the forthcoming support for <BUZZWORDS>.  :-)
