I already have a patch doing this in my tree.
Also note that the entry in feature-removal-schedule.txt never made it
to mainline (it was in -mm only), so it can't be removed.
In theory there is a driver rewrite in progress, so my plan is to
include this removal patch into -mm for now, and send it to Linus only
for 2.6.24 if I don't receive an acceptable driver meanwhile.
Thanks,
