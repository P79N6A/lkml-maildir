	Hello,
	Just downloaded the 2.3.36-pre1 patch, and try the bttv module, the 
color is right again but sound still doesn't work.
	I'm using an AVermedia TVPhone98, I've tried loading the msp3400 
module by hand but it doesn't make any difference. One thing that may 
have something to do is that when using previous kernels (pre i2c-merge) 
I have to patch bttv.c by hand in order to change BTTV_INTERN to 
BTTV_MUTE, or I'll get sound from the TV even when I close the device.
