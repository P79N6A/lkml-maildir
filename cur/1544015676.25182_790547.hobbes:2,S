It could be an unclean build tree. Jiri, could you double-check that 
you've got the right kernel and if it still triggers, could you 
investigate where this build error could come from?
ldt.c includes asm/paravirt.h already, via asm/mmu_context.h, so it should 
be picking up the paravirt_alloc/free_ldt() definitions.
