Subject: [PATCH] tmpfs: recommend remount for mpol
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

akpm points out that switching to a non-NUMA kernel could be irritating
if mounting tmpfs fails on an mpol option: tmpfs.txt recommend remount.

+Note that trying to mount a tmpfs with an mpol option will fail if the
+running kernel does not support NUMA; and will fail if its nodelist
+specifies a node >= MAX_NUMNODES.  If your system relies on that tmpfs
+being mounted, but from time to time runs a kernel built without NUMA
+capability (perhaps a safe recovery kernel), or configured to support
+fewer nodes, then it is advisable to omit the mpol option from automatic
+mount options.  It can be added later, when the tmpfs is already mounted
+on MountPoint, by 'mount -o remount,mpol=Policy:NodeList MountPoint'.
