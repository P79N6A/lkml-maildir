It appears that we basically support order 3 allocations and
less (those will stay in the page allocator until something
happens).
I see your point... Mel's patch has failure cases though.
For example, someone turns swap off, or mlocks some memory
(I guess we then add the page migration defrag patch and
problem is solved?).
I do see your point. The extra complexity makes me cringe though
(no offence to Mel - I'm sure it is a complex problem).

No but I was just saying it is just another degree of
"unsuportedness" (or supportedness, if you are a half full man).

No, I'm quite sure it isn't that simple, unfortunately. Hence

Yep, I was trying to help get something going!
