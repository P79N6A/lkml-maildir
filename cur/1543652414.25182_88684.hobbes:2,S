1. We have a hardware platform which do not have a PS/2 style keyboard
controller.  When the kernel boots we get the following message, printed
many times over:
"pc_keyb: controller jammed 0xFF"
2. In the file linx/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c, the following lines are
present (lines 72-74 for kernel version 2.4.20-pre10)
#ifndef kbd_controller_present
#define kbd_controller_present()        1
#endif
By changing kbd_controller_present() to '0' instead of '1', we no longer
the the "jammed" message and a 15-20 second reduction in boot time.
3. It would be nice if there were a .config file parameter that was the
moral equivalent of CONFIG_PSMOUSE for the keyboard, like say
CONFIG_PSKEYBD so that the keyboard could be disabled as easily as the
mouse.
4. We try to maintain different linux/.config files for each hardware
platform.  This works well, except in this case of the keyboard.  In
this case we have to maintain a hardware specific patch.
Is it possible to get a new .config file symbol for the keyboard similar
to the mouse?  It would be very helpful to us.
Thanks,
Nat
