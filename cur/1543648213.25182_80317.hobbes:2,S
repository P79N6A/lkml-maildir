The key thing here appears to be the cache entry:
+struct mb_cache_entry {
+       struct list_head                e_lru_list;
+       struct mb_cache                 *e_cache;
+       atomic_t                        e_used;
+       dev_t                           e_dev;
+       unsigned long                   e_block;
+       struct list_head                e_block_list;
+       struct mb_cache_entry_index     e_indexes[0];
+};
This should be converted to use sector_t for >2TB support, and tested
with CONFIG_LBD=y and n.
The use of a dev_t search key is a bit old-fashioned.  Maybe
use the address of inode->i_sb->s_bdev?
