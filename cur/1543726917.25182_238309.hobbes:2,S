My original version have this in it:
/* assign the ROM an address if it doesn't have one */
if (r->parent == NULL)
   pci_assign_resource(dev->pdev, PCI_ROM_RESOURCE);
                                                                       
                  
if (r->parent) {
    release_resource(r);
    r->flags &= ~PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE;
    r->end -= r->start;
    r->start = 0;
}
I was running this code on both 2.4/2.6 but I may have needed to do
this for 2.4. Is it consistent to have pci_assign_resource() and then
use release_resource()?
My i875P AGP controller has a ROM on it as well as my two video cards.
