this decision is totally automatic - so if your situation happens and 
the kernel isnt reschedulable, then the notifier chain wont be called 
and nothing changes from your perspective. Hm, perhaps this should be 
dependent on CONFIG_PREEMPT, to make sure preempt_count() is reliable?
but from my perspective this patch fixes a real regression.
updated patch attached below.

Subject: [patch] call reboot notifier list when doing an emergency reboot
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
my laptop does not reboot unless the shutdown notifiers are called
first. So the following command, which i use as a fast way to reboot
into a new kernel:
 echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger
just hangs indefinitely after the kernel prints "System rebooting".
the thing is, that the kernel is actually reschedulable in this stage,
so we could as well process the reboot_notifier_list. (furthermore,
on -rt kernels this place is preemptable even during SysRq-b)
So just process the reboot notifier list if we are preemptable. This
will shut disk caches and chipsets off.
