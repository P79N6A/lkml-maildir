Which is pretty much what make oldconfig does. Go from the top asking users
about new symbols and just killing stuff that would break the rules.

Thats the mathematician speaking again

Its worked well enough for the past five years. On odd occasions you do find
you've inadventantly unconfigured something but normally the conflict vanishes
with almost no ripples.
I'm quite happy for oldconfig to continue to do what it did before. I'm quite
happy to accept its mathematically imperfect, because it hasnt gone far wrong
yet
