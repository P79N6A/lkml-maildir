There are two possible inconsistancies:
1) kHTTPd thinks it is executable and the userspace daemon does not.
   No problem, since kHTTPd passes the request to userspace daemon and
   let it take care of it.
2) kHTTPd doesn't think it is executable (and serves the file) and the 
   userspace daemon disagrees.
   This really shouldn't happen; ANY well designed webserver only executes
   files marked "executable".

Yes it is. Not a lot of people want to share their site-internals.
