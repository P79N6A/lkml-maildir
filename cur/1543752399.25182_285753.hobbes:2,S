So you would be for a closed list, but there would be no incentive at
all for anyone on the list to keep the contents of what was posted to
the list closed at any time?  That goes against the above stated goal of
complying with RFPolicy.
I understand your dislike of having to wait once you know of a security
issue before making the fix public, but how should distros coordinate
fixes in any other way?
