Hi,
I was wonder if creating such library makes any sense at all, 
considering the nature of cgroups, the way they work and their possible 
application?
It seems to me that any attempt to create a 'simple' API would actualy 
result in something that will be much harder to use that just making raw 
mkdir/open/read/write/close operations. Another thing is suggested 
config for this lib would be more appropriate for a daemon rather than a 
library.
In general - cgroup is a very flexible subsystem that can be used in a 
wide variety of ways and modes and trying to create a universal simple 
API would more likely result in something hard to manage and work with.
The idea of having multiple container managers (applications that use 
libcg) creates a lots of questions and possible issues. Containers are 
supposed provide a flexible resource management and task grouping 
ability, which somewhat implies that there cannot be two different 
resource managers per node without one knowing well the 
desires/goals/methods of the other and vice versa. And should there be 
only one manager per node - probably it will be easier for it to use 
cgroup subsystem directly rather than using a wrapper library?

Peter Litov.

> 1.1 What are Control Groups
>
> Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of
> tasks, and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with
> specialized behaviour [1]. It makes use of a filesystem interface.
>
> 1.2 Aims of libcg
>
> libcg aims to provide programmers easily usable APIs to use the control
> group file system. It should satisfy the following requirements
>
> 1.2.1. Provide a programmable interface for cgroups
>
> This should allow applications to create cgroups using something like
> create_cgroup() as opposed to having to go the whole filesystem route.
>
> 1.2.2. Provide persistent configuration across reboots
>
> Control Groups have a lifetime of only one boot cycle. The configuration
> is lost at reboot. Userspace needs to handle this issue. This is handled
> by libcg
>
> 1.2.3. Provide a programmable interface for manipulating configurations
>
> This should allow libcg to handle changing application requirements. For
> example, while gaming, you might want to reduce the cpu power of other
> groups whereas othertimes you would want greater CPU power for those
> groups.

>
> 3.1.2 Delete Control Group:  This API is proposed to delete control groups.

> as like Create Control Group does.
>
> More details about configuration are available in sections 2 and 4.

> 3.2. Manipulating Configurations

> 3.2.1. Generate Configuration File: If a cgroup filesystem hierarchy already exists,
> it should be possible to generate a configuration file which can create it. This
> is proposed to be provided by this API.

> 3.2.2. Change Configuration File: If one configuration is currently loaded in

> file to be modified.
>
> We should also plan on taking care of statistics once its available in mainline.

> There are multiple configuration levels. The basic wlm.conf file will provide

> the adminstrator. No APIs will be provided to modify this file.
