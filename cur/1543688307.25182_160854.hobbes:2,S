Subject: 2.6.0-test4 suspends IDE devices after resume

I'm running 2.6.0-test4 (with Con Kolivas' interactivity patch) and
twice I've had my IDE devices re-suspend after I resume from an APM
suspend (to disk/hibernation).  This is obviously annoying, because
there's little you can do to recover from it!  :-) The machine is an
IBM ThinkPad T22 with an IDE interface that looks like this:
  00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01)
I didn't see this problem with test3 (or test2 or test1).
Stuff I copied down from the console is at the end of this message.
"..." indicates intermingled USB stuff that I didn't write down.
Apart from that, I've also seen a message in my logs that looks like:
  hda: a request made it's way while we are power managing...
Any ideas?
peace & happiness,
martin
