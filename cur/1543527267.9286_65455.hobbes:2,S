It has the same problem as buffer cache if browsing the whole list takes
more than one timeslice. With inodes this shouldn't happen in RL though. I
think it should work. The repeat has to restart from the top of the list
to revalidate "entry".
A more correct approch probably would be to allow "goto repeat" only at
once to avoid the deadlock condition in R state.
