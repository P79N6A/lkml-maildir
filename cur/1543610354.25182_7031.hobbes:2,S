Er, with almost 3megs of free memory and -47megs- of cache, the problem isn't 
with the OOM killer's selection, but the fact it was triggered with nearly 
half the RAM still usable. Do you actually know the OOM killer was triggered? 
Or did top just mysteriously exit?
Personally, I've found the new 2.4.14+ OOM killer to be highly accurate, I've 
run ext3's shared mappings torture test on my 384meg RAM (256meg swap) box 
repeatedly, and it pushes my computer to OOM every 60 seconds or so. It 
always kills the correct process, with my box remaining absolutely stable, 
even with less swap space than RAM.
