By nature, it's impossible to do optimal page replacement without being 
prescient.  Nonetheless, it is possible to spot some patterns and take 
advantage of them.
Look at bzip if you need inspiration.  I've seen it do a few bytes worse 
occasionally, but on average it does the job about 20% better than gzip, 
amazing.

The hooks are there but it's unlikely very many people will ever use them, 
even if encouraged.  Also, the kernel has information available to it that 
the application programmer does not.  For example, the kernel knows about the 
current, system-wide load.
The ideal arrangement is for madvise to complement the kernel's automagic 
heuristics.  Bearing that in mind, I'll take care not to break it.
