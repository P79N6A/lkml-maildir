Not to mention that some mirrors also do not delete files that were
deleted from the master archive at ftp.kernel.org.  For instance,
kernel.wisewire.com has several LATEST-IS-2.2.0-preX files.  I'm sticking
to the closest/fastest mirror I find and using its canonical name
explicitly to mirror just the latest several releases in bz2 format.

Presumeably, the LKMS is only meant for end-users downloading a couple
files, not for re-mirroring part of the archive.  I don't think it is
unreasonable in that case to require the user to get bzip2, considering
its increasing popularity and benefits; at least it comes with most recent
distributions.  What would be nice is if tar supported bz2 directly so one
could use "tar xvzf foo.tar.bz2".
