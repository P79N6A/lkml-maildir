Agreed.  2.5.x should not use -pre.  Just increment X.  
2.4.x should continue to use -preY.
There's no need for a -rcY as some have suggested.
All we need to do to avoid messes like the 2.4.15 debacle
is to insist that a 2.4.X-preY should not be
released as final 2.4.X until the pre's been out for a week,
and there should never be any changes introduced into a final
that didn't cook for a week as a pre.  Marcello, what say ye?
That should give enough time for everyone to
find bugs and yell.
