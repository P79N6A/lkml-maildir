Just to avoid starting false rumours: on ia-64, I see the following
(2.4.18, with gcc3.1):
	- ext2_follow_link():	 16 bytes/frame
	- vfs_follow_link():	 56 bytes/frame
	- link_path_walk():	128 bytes/frame
	---------------------	---------------
	total:			200 bytes/frame
Just about in line with what you'd expect given that registers are 64 bits.
