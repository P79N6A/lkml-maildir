Read Brian Gerst's response. My whole point was that interrupts are
not associated with a user process, which I have shown. If the designer
decided to use a portion of some kernel element as an interrupt stack
it does not change this essential fact. The user processes` stack is
not even used for the return address of the interrupt so the user's
stack-pointer is never touched at all.
