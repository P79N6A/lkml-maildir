I tried to reproduce it on two machines running 2.6.24.2, with cfq 
scheduler.
One machine, with 5x HDD, RAID-5, dm-crypt/LUKS, LVM, ext3 on top of it 
all - I created a 250 GB file, the load was 4-5. No lockups or anything.
Later, removing that 250 GB file took over 7 minutes, but that's a 
different story.
Second machine, dm-crypt on a USB-connected drive, LVM, ext3 on top of 
it, X with nvidia binary blob (version 169.09). I created a 190 GB file, 
the load was indeed pretty high - up to about 14. But still, no lockups 
of any kind.
