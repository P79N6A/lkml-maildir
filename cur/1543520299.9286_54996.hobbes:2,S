I don't claim to be a PCI guru, but...
* If you read a byte immediately after writing a byte, I think
you should be ok.
* Your entire routine above could possibly be replaced with memcpy_toio
or memcpy_fromio.
* If memcpy_toio doesn't work for you because of some constraints, make
sure you are still using readl() and writel(), NOT direct memory
references.  See Documentation/IO-mapping.txt.
