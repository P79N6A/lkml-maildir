Hmm... there are some discussions currently on v4l ML about the need to
add some standards to support some digital streams, like those used on
webcams. Depending on the result of those discussions, we can need to
use more bits. So, I think it is not worth right now to replace video
std on every place it occurs.
I'm to just do the fix at v4l2-common.c.

Ok, I've wrote such patch. I should send today or tomorrow to Linus,
together with other patches.
