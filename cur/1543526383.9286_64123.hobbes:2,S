Hello,
Like I promised earlier, I have tested smbfs under linux to copy larger
files from one smbmouted drive to another.
Ok, the test:
Linux2.2.15pre7, i586, samba 2.0.6, filesize = 60MB
copying file from one mount to another:
smbfs->ext2: OK
ext2->smbfs: OK
smbfs->smbfs: permanent I/O error after several MBs are copied
this is dumped into log when the IO error occurs:
------------
Feb 18 11:46:37 ns kernel: smb_writepage_sync: short write, wsize=512,
result=256
Feb 18 11:46:46 ns kernel: smb_get_length: recv error = 104
Feb 18 11:46:46 ns kernel: smb_request: result -104, setting invalid
Feb 18 11:46:46 ns kernel: smb_retry: new pid=1070, generation=2
Sounds familiar ?
Regards,
Petr
