I think I'm making progress.
I have 128 MB RAM, and a single 256 MB swap partition.
I pressed SysRq-D, swsusp displayed all sorts of successful messages, and 
then rebooted my computer. (can I get it to poweroff my computer instead of 
reboot it?)
When it started up again, the kernel displayed the message "Unable to find 
swap-space signature" and went on to fsck. The swap partition seemed dead. I 
ran mkswap and swapon to get my swap partition back.
Any idea what went wrong? I'd love to get swsusp working.
Thanks,
Shaun
