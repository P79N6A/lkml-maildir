). DRM is back with good performance.
Actually, this doesn't fix Benoit's problem (even if we were initially
having the same errors (radeon_cp_init called without lock held)).
It seems that memsetting the whole bridge structure to 0 (instead of
juste the agp_in_use field) fixes Benoit's problem too.
No idea which field was responsible for this. New patch attached.
