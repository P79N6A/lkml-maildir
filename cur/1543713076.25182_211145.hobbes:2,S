filemap_flush() will do exactly this.  So if you want the Solaris
semantics, calling filemap_flush() intead of filemap_fdatawrite() should do
it.

The patches I have queued in -mm allow us to do this.  We use
find_get_pages_tag() to iterate over only the dirty pages in the tree.
That still has the efficiency problem that when searching for dirty pages
we also visit pages which are both dirty and under writeback (we're not
interested in those pages if it is a non-blocking flush), although I've
only observed that to be a problem when the queue size was bumped up to
10,000 requests and I fixed that up for the common cases by other means.
