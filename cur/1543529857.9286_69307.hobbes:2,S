I am having trouble with ACPI + Sony VAIO notebook + 2.3.51. When
compiled in,
ACPI sez "BUG in io_remap line 72!" followed by a forced oops. In fact
it's
oopsing all over the place. I'll send details when I finish reading
emails since
2.3.51 barely runs at all for me and I've had to go to 2.2.14 just to
send this.
Erik.
