 Heh.  The whole Eclipse/CDT/Stellation assemblage takes so much work
just to get off the ground it's not even funny, not to mention their
directions for putting Stellation on Oracle are curiously empty.

Can I somehow 'collapse' the csets together when browsing the repository?
A nice example might be the recent ethernet padding fix, where there ended
up being a whole set of separate patches.  By looking through the
comments I can piece together a complete patch, but it's painful.
