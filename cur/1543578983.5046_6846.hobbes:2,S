	[Venkatesh Ramamurthy]  When i meant BIOS setting option i meant the
SCSI BIOS settings not system BIOS option. The two SCSI controllers are of
different make. This situation is made worse when the system has many cards
of different makes and one of the controller somewhere in the middle of all
the slots is made the boot controller.
