pci_cfg_space_size()  is only done for PCI-express  or PCI-X mode 2
devices, so you still have eliminated the bulk of the problems which are
typically handling the legacy busses on modern machines. I don't know
what is the amd7111.

I am not familiar with the tg3 driver, just trying to give a 5 minutes
look, it seems the typical cases where the pci-conf-space is used
intensively are with some rev in combination with the 82801
(TG3_FLG2_ICH_WORKAROUND) which I don't think support mmconfig anyway,
as well as some very specific PCI-X combinations
(TG3_FLAG_PCIX_TARGET_HWBUG) which are also very unlikely to support
mmconfig.
Even if I am wrong for the tg3, I don't really think mmconfig vs type1
could make a noticeable performance on any common systems (obscure
systems or hardware where it could potentially have a performance impact
could  use a non-default configuration).
