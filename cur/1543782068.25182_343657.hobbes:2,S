Hi,
I am on a Dell Inspiron 8100 laptop with 512 M and 1G disk cache. I
usually have at least 4 big applications running simultaneously: a
Java IDE, firefox, firefox and X. All that under the Gnome desktop.
I've sometimes seen periods where my laptop goes kind of nuts. While
the cpu is still at 0%, the workload goes to 100% (as shown in the
gnome process monitor) (I haven't checked in other means, e.g. top or
/proc info as my machine is unusable).
But with my latest upgrade to 2.6.12 from 2.6.10, the hanging happens
much more often. It lasts for over 30 seconds.
Could this hanging be related to swapping?
Are there any VM regression lately that would make a kernel less
appropriate for desktop use?
How can I investigate that further?
Thanks
