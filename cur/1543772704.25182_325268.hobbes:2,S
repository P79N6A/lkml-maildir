Hi Ilan,
I've been working through this book too, not sure why it's not working for 
you. Have you actually built the kernel in the directory you're pointing it 
at? I was able to use the command:
make -C /usr/src/linux M=`pwd`
where my Makefile had
        obj-m := eaglenet.o
The makefile I've generally used that works fine (so you can just type make) 
was:
ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
        obj-m := eaglenet.o
else
        KERNELDIR ?= /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
        PWD := $(shell pwd)
default:
        $(MAKE) -C $(KERNELDIR) M=$(PWD) modules
endif
Where my module was eaglenet.
Regards,
Edward
