I don't know how vendors handle this however he may be right, or it
may be vendor dependant. Have you asked which vendors do this and which
don't. Maybe you just need the right drive vendor. 
The Linux IDE layer will retry a failed write not sure about the 2.4.22
SATA code although the early versions probably were not business ready
anyway.

For IDE you either
1. turn off write caching
2. buy a hardware raid card (which will turn off write caching or
   have battery backup or both 8))
3. accept that its unlikely to get burned in normal usage especially 
   with a UPS.
