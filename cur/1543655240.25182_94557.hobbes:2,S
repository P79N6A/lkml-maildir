I'm not so keen on this.  The idea of this parameter is not to tell the 
allocation routine what type of memory you would like, but to tell it what 
type of memory the driver can cope with.  I think for the inconsistent case, 
DMA_INCONSISTENT looks like the driver is requiring inconsistent memory, and 
expecting to get it.  I'm open to changing the "CONFORMANCE" part, but I'd 
like to name these parameters something that doesn't imply they're requesting 
a type of memory.
