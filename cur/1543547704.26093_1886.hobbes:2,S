Ingo,
I on't believe debating with you on this topic will change your mind  --
you seem to have already decided.  Here's some substance -- visit
vger.timpanogas.org/manos/os/src/*.tar.gz  download the code, boot it,
copy the source files, invoke the kernel debugger (with alt-d) and try
it for yourself and see if you think having that in inux would save you
hours of debugging time.  
:-)
