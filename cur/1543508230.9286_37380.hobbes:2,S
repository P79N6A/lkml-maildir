Hi,
I've got an ALi M1542 UDMA chipset and the current kernel (2.2.12) only
has support for M14xx.  The generic UDMA thing ("Use DMA by default" I
think) doesn't work and "hdparm -d1 /dev/hdx" doesn't work either.  It
says "Operation not permitted" or some other error like that.
Does anyone know it the M14xx driver will work on my M1542 or if there
is another way of getting UDMA working?
