Oops I should have been clearer than that. Shouldn't email in a hurry. Yes the 
solution is not the right one, yes you can get longer periods of starvation 
compared with UP mode, but if the constant bouncing and balancing of tasks 
puts the low priority task on the same runqueue as the high priority one it 
will get scheduled. This is why Nick's idea of unbalancing runqueues for 
priority difference makes sense. However pushing and pulling tasks very 
frequently may be expensive so it's hard to know how well that will work.
