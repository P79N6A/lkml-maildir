No, GFP_NOIO means - do not generate block IO operations (e.g. move 
pages to swap, sync dirty buffers to permanent storage etc.) in order to 
fulfill this allocation.
The reason for this flag here is presumably that such block IO 
operations may very cause USB transaction of the very same kind we're 
trying to service now, which can easily get us to a loop.

In many cases there is no problem to DMA high memory. If you happen to 
be working with a device that does have problems with full 32 bit 
addresses then GFP_DMA would be the right flag, not GFP_NOIO.
