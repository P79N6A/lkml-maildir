It's to cover the case where you are loading the kernel from a floppy disk,
and said kernel does not have the floppy driver configured in.  The outb_p
turns the floppy drives off.

I'd like it see it replaced by a floppy_off() or similar, which the architecture
can define for itself.  Who says that the floppy that you're using to boot is
controled via port 0x3f2 in all cases?
