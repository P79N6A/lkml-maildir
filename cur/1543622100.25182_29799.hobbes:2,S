   Probably John Eskes is the just messenger. These silly and huge signatures are 
crawling all over the place. Just the other day people in my previous job, a practical 
and feet on ground middle size company, were told by a marketing guy (i don't have 
a better description of what he does) to use one, apparently to look like a 
"corporation" of some sort to customers, never mind the fact they don't have any 
policy whatsoever on email and internet usage. But i digress. In this case it seems to 
be the Dutch police. If they didn't have internal policies, who would have? :)
