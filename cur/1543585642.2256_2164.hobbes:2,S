To some extent I was also very puzzled by your complaint.
You have setup a system that by your definition unreliably and then
you complain it is unreliable.

Now all I know the system didn't have enough resources to do what
you asked to it do and it failed.  That sounds reliable to me.  
Obviously you were suprised at how the system failed.  Given
that unix has been doing this kind of thing for decades, you obviously
missed how the unix malloc overcommited memory.
Does you application trap sigsegv on a different stack so you can
catch stack growth failure?  And how does your app handle this case?
Having a no over commit kernel option would help.  
A cheap workaround is to call mlock_all(MCL_FUTRE...).  Then you are
garantteed you will always have ram locked into memory for your
program.   This assumes you have enough ram for your program.
