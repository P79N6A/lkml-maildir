And I've just committed that patch set to convert platform drivers
to struct platform_driver... which is about 250K.
Anything not converted continues to work as it always used to, so
the only breakage is if I mis-converted something.  However, I've
build-tested allyesconfig on i386, and several ARM configs, and I'm
not aware of any build problems.
This couldn't be submitted earlier because ARM SMP work took
priority, and getting to a stage where the platform_driver stuff
was suitable against the rapidly moving target is rather, err,
time consuming.  Plus, gregkh only recently gave his ack to it.
