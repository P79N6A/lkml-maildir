I'm working to fix a couple of external modules so they will work with later
2.5 kernels.  I've gotten the whole module building structure down fine but
I can't seem to find any examples or documentation on a possible replacement
for handle_scancode symbol that's accessible for a module.  Any help or 
recommendations?
