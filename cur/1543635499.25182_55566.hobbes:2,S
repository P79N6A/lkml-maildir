The most up-to-date version is in the ext3 CVS tree at sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
the ext3 package therein has "features-branch" on which the ext3 htree
patch has already been applied (along with other ext3 fixes).  If you
only want the ext3 htree patch, you can also get it from the "lustre"
sourceforge project at "lustre/extN/htree-ext3-2.4.18.diff".
Cheers, Andreas
