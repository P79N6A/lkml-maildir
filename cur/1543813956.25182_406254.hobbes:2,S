	It should be possible to define a reasonable set of requirements that one
must meet in order to claim to "support Linux", just as Microsoft does for
Windows. One requirement should definitely be that driver source code be
available to everyone who purchases the hardware and that all (or at least
sufficient) interfaces to the hardware be well-documented.
