Actually I don't know for sure what plans are afoot to fix the slab allocator
for per-cpu. One plan I heard about was allocating from per-cpu pools
rather than per-cpu copies. My requirements are similar to
the hot list skbs. I want to do this -
	int *ctrp1, *ctrp2;
	ctrp1 = kmalloc_percpu(sizeof(*ctrp1), GFP_ATOMIC);
	if (ctrp1 == NULL) {
		/* recover */
	}
	ctrp2 = kmalloc_percpu(sizeof(*ctrp2), GFP_ATOMIC);
	if (ctrp2 == NULL) {
		/* recover */
	}
	*per_cpu_ptr(ctrp1, smp_processor_id())++;
	this_cpu_ptr(ctrp2)++;
Now I can allocate by making ctrp1/ctrp2 point to an array
of NR_CPUS and kmalloc() memory for each CPU's copy of the
int. This is simple and will work. 
	void **ptrs = kmalloc(sizeof(*ptrs) * NR_CPUS, flags);
	if (!ptrs) return NULL;
	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {
	      ptrs[i] = kmalloc(size, flags);
	      if (!ptrs[i])
		      goto unwind_oom;
	}
However I would like to use kmalloc_percpu() for allocating very 
small objects - typlically integer counters or small structures
to be used as per-cpu counters for things like dst entries and dentries.
kmalloc will waste the rest of the cache line for such small objects.
The alternative is to use a layer of code to interleave small objects
and save on space.
   CPU #0          CPU#1
 ---------       ---------         Start of cache line
   *ctrp1         *ctrp1
   *ctrp2         *ctrp2
   .               .
   .               .
   .               .
   .               .
   .               .
 ---------       ----------        End of cache line
I have an allocator that interleaves objects like this if they can be fitted
into size that is a factor of SMP_CACHE_BYTES. 
I hope someone can tell me that I don't even have to do this. Otherwise
I will go ahead and do my thing.
Thanks
