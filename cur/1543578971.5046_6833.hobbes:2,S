to put it more accurately: the requirement is to be able to open(), use
and close() an unlimited number of file descriptors with O(1) overhead,
under any allocation pattern, with only RAM limiting the number of files.
Both of my proposals attempt to provide this. It's possible to open() O(1)
but do a O(log(N)) close(), but that is of no practical value IMO.
