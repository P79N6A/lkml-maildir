I've never needed it.
Uli, maybe you forgot about that "open source" thing?
And btw, the kernel doesn't even _know_ many of the sysconf values. They
depend on library implementation, and apparently even on things like the
implementation of the "expr" binary. So "sysconf()" is not a kernel thing.
A subset of those sysconf values are things that you should ask the
kernel, but go look at what sysconf should return: it's definitely not a
system call.
You're barking up the wrong tree.
