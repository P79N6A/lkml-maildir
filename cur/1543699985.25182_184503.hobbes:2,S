I get this problem all the time here at JPL. I can always get the files 
back by remounting the filesystem.
For example if /dev/sdb1 mounted on /export/project is getting wierd 
"Input/output" errors I can simply run this command:
mount -o remount /dev/sdb1 /export/project
It's been about a year of these problems... I'll try running the test 
Tsuchiya Yoshihiro made to reproduce. (I have not been able to create a 
test that can consistantly reproduce... but the problem has sure screwed 
up some data-gathering runs in the lab).
These are all on Mandrake kernels though.... (from the 9.0 series). so 
that's 2.4.19+tonOfPatches.
