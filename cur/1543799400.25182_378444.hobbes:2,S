I guess so. I'm not so worried about the rare 'lucky bastard' ie. a
lock request coming in concurrently, but rather the naturally favoured
'this CPU' taking the lock again after waking up the head waiter but
before it gets a chance to run / transfer the cacheline.
At the very least, the head waiter should not put itself on the end of
the FIFO when it finds the lock contended and waits again.
But yes, also interesting would be performance of the _completely_ FIFO
implementation.
