   Here are the results in terms of profile counts in
   ip_route_output_key() - gc stands for neighbor table garbage
   collection adjustment and u2000 stands for 2ms packet
   rate delay. All measurements where done based on  2.5.3 kernel.
Thanks, I am convinced RCU is the way to go.
Once the generic RCU bits are in the 2.5.x tree, feel free to
send me your ipv4 routing cache changes.
