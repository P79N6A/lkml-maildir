Pity.
(It is not important, but having the type formally visible
makes it easier to do automatic verification of contexts like
	FOOIOCTL:
	    {
		struct foo_arg *uarg = (struct foo_arg *) arg;
		err = handle_fooioctl(fd, uarg);
		break;
	    }
One might even wish to generate them automatically.
I think relegating the type to a comment is a microstep in the wrong direction.)
