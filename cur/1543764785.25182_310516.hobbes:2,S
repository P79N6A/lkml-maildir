Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 10, 2005 at 10:38:11PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

Funnily enough, now after some more cache teasing it's ~0.185. Your one
still ~0.17, though. :/ (That might be because of the format changes,
though, since you do less printing now.) (BTW, all those measurements
are done on my AMD K6 walking on 1600MHz, 512M RAM, about 200M available
for caches.)
Just out of interest, did you have a look at my diff-tree -r
implementation and decided that you don't like it, or you weren't aware
of it?
I will probably take most of your diff-tree change, but I'd prefer to do
the sha1->tree mapping directly in diff_tree().

Me too, of course.

I see.

I currently already do a merge when you track someone's source - it will
throw away your previous HEAD record though, so if you committed some
local changes after the previous pull, you will get orphaned commits and
the changes will turn to uncommitted ones. I have some ideas regarding
how to do it properly (and do any arbitrary merging, for that matter), I
hope to get to it as soon as I catch up with you. :-)
BTW, the three-way merge comes from RCS. That reminds me, is there any
tool which will take .rej files and throw them into the file to create
rcsmerge-like conflicts? Perhaps it's fault of my bad tools, but I
prefer to work with the inline rejects much more to .rej files (except
to actually notice the rejects).

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
