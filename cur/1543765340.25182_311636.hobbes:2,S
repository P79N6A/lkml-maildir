As a practical matter, one can make or modify the source-code
of a driver to use any symbols available in System.map. One
can even make a "preloader" program that gets the right stuff
for the correct kernel, puts it into the module, then has
the standard module loader load it.
There is way too much effort being applied to hiding kernel
symbols. As long as you have the tools available to build
a kernel, you have the tools available to use any symbol.
Here is the kernel offset of 'sys_call_table' and 'sys_ni_syscall'
TABLE := $(shell grep sys_call_table /boot/System.map | cut -f1 -d' ')
NISYS := $(shell grep sys_ni_syscall /boot/System.map | cut -f1 -d' ')
DEFS   = -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -DMAJOR_NR=$(MAJR) -DCONFIG_SMP
DEFS  += -DMODNAME=$(NAME) -DTABLE=0x$(TABLE) -DNISYS=0x$(NISYS)
You just initialize your module pointers to these values and
you have access to these objects. Simple.
Although I haven't tried it, I think one can even borrow a
__mod_licensexxx by using /proc/kallsyms. The point being that
trying to prevent one from using existing kernel code in
kernel modules will, eventually, fail completely unless we
only get binaries with no source-code. Even in that case,
many symbols within /proc/kallsyms are useful.
Cheers,
