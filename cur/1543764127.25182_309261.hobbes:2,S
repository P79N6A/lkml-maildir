Hi,
while reading Documentation/CodingStyle for the nth time, I realized that I had
read some conflicting coding style in some patch posted to the linux-kernel
mailing-list; in include/linux/page-flags.h, there is a lot of defines that are
apparently frowned upon:
HOWEVER, while mixed-case names are frowned upon, descriptive names for
global variables are a must.  To call a global function "foo" is a
shooting offense.
Are those an exception to the rule or would for example PF_LOCKED/pf_locked be
a nice replacement for PageLocked?
Just wondering; with no intention to change code that I do not understand :)
Kenneth
