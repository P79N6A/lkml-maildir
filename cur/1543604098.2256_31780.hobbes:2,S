because I flamed you for releasing the 1.0.0 without any comfortable upgrade
path from some versions of LVM, I want to congratulate for this one.
1.0.1-rcX has been tested by me and a lot of ppl @ SuSE and it does work
without upgrade headaches. Good job!
Thanks to you, your team, Andreas Dilger and all the others that contributed
to get this to work!
Regards,
