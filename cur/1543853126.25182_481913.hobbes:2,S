Right.  I don't know anything about SuperIO/SH, but the mfd stuff I've 
worked with to date (UCB1400, SM501) all provide for the various 
functions by mapping them into existing APIs like i2c, ALSA, etc. which 
aren't disturbed by Dave's proposal.  They still have their limitations, 
i.e. you wouldn't want to put an IDE controller out on one of the GPIO 
lines of a UCB1400, a problem that Dave isn't trying to address.

The platform _is_ the system, as far as the driver is concerned.  I 
think they're indistinguishable.
What the driver needs is an enumeration that it can hand to the GPIO 
layer that says, "set this high" or "set this low", or "what is the 
state on this line?".  The platform_device structure is a great place to 
pass it the enumerations that, deep in the bowels of the platform/system 
code, map into actual GPIO lines.  I don't think that's close to static 
pin assignment any more than using the platform_device structure to pass 
IRQ line enumerations is now.  Think: today, most drivers don't know or 
care if an IRQ line is edge-triggered or level-triggered.  That code is 
in the domain of the IRQ subsystem.  What David is proposing is the same 
sort of thing for GPIO.

I don't see what David is proposing as being a temporary hack.  Rather, 
it's a starting point.  We can add another layer on after the sync/async 
issues are sorted out--- which I think is a challenging problem that 
will take a while.  I'd rather have some uniformity today that we can 
use across ARM, and ultimately other arches as well.

Agreed.
