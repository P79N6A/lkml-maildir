It depends where the data got corrupted. Normally transfers over the PCI 
or PCI Express bus are protected by parity (or CRC or something, I 
assume on PCI-E) so errors there would get detected. This is quite rare 
unless the motherboard or expansion card is faulty or badly designed 
with timing problems.
However, it's conceivable that data could get corrupted inside the 
controller, or inside the chipset. This seems quite rare however, except 
in the presence of design flaws (like some VIA southbridges that had 
nasty problems with losing data if PCI bus masters kept the CPU off the 
PCI bus too long, which we have to work around).

I don't know any controller that works in this way. This would greatly 
increase CPU overhead since the CPU would need to perform this CRC 
calculation.
