So what if the chapter you wrote was generic enough that it *could* be 
used for different books? Maybe it couldn't be read alone (at least not 
with a small book the link the chapters to make logical sense), but it 
could be read as a whole along with lots of book.
In that case you would believe such a book would not be a derivative 
work, correct?
