I was not using an SMP kernel.
I redid the test with 2.6.8-rc2-J4 (vp:2 kp:0), and latencytest-0.5.4
with your locking fix, and it went ok. I did the test holding a key to
track the problem I'm seeing with the keyboard (xrun/latency spike on
8.079 sec boundaries if a keybord interrupt happens at this moment).
You can find the results including the traces generated with showtrace
