My first mail to lkml.
I would like to know what happened to linux kernel from its 1.0.
I have gone through lkml faqs, and some of LDP documents. Thought that
weekly lkml summary "Kernel Traffic" (
http://www.kerneltraffic.org/
)
would be useful, but its not.
Important linux kernel bugs, fixes that were available those bugs.
Why one fix got chosen over other fixes, and related tradeoffs?
Sorry, I am too lazy to go through entire lkml, or lk usenet postings.
Are there any documents in web? How I should proceed? where I have to
start with?
