It is inconsistent, on purpose.  It's essentially like perl's
	return unless pointer;
which is a oneliner, almost like an assert().
Maybe this will help: I insist on braces on anything with indentation so
that I can scan them more quickly.  If I gave you a choice between
	if (!pointer) {
		return (whatever);
	}
	if (!pointer) return (whatever);
which one will you type more often?  I actually don't care which you use,
I prefer the shorter one because I don't measure my self worth in lines 
of code generated, I tend to favor lines of code deleted :)  But either
one is fine, I tend to use the first one if it has been a problem area
and I'm likely to come back and shove in some debugging.
Before you say "lose the braces" try reading more code and see how much faster
it is if all indented stuff has braces.  You whiz through it.

You are in North Carolina, I'm in San Francisco.  No competition, you are
sweating like a pig :)

Dinner?  You got dinner?  Damn, you were spoiled.
