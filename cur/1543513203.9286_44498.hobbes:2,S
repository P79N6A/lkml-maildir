I vote for ifconfig to be obsoleted by iproute. My next KSI Linux
distribution won't use ifconfig at all. I have not made a decision yet
whether to retain the ifconfig binary for compatibility reasons or remove
any trace of it outta the distribution, but chances are that it will be
removed at all...
