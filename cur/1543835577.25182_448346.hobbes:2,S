Ingo,  this spinlock is probably still a barrier, but is it still a
barrier on itself?  That is, the problem here is that we have the
compiler optimizing the lock_ptr temp variable that is used inside the
spin_lock.  So does a spin_lock protect itself, or just the stuff inside
it?
Here we need a barrier to keep gcc from optimizing the use of the lock
and not what the lock is protecting.
I don't know about other areas in the kernel that has a dynamic spin
lock like this that needs protection.
