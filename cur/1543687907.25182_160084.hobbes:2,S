There was a proposal a long ways back to allow X to download instructions to
the kernel on how to restore the video mode. The proposal was to code the
instructions as a forth program that frobbed registers appropriately. The
kernel would have a small forth interpretor to run it. Then switching
resolutions could happen safely in the kernel.
