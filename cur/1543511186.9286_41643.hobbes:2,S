This is a BAD thing. If you don't mantain binary compatibily _at least_ in
stable realeases, all could be a nightmare. Last time someone changes de
libstdc++ for example, I have to recompile ALL kde. I don't know WHY, binary
compatibily in stables releases are bad. And no, I no have time to recompile
all system for every interface change. I have to study and work too.
