IME, not knowing that exactly is the rule rather than the exception.  
There's a reason we have autodetect code in all sorts of software,  
including the Linux kernel.
Now, if we cannot reliably autodetect hardware, we should always make it  
possible to override this manually, and maybe also inform the user that  
we're not certain. But that's no excuse not to try to autodetect when the  
user has *not* overridden us.
