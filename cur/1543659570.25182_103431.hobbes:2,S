hi Richard,
At the point in time when you started the GNU project, do you mind
telling us how much of the GNU code was based on BSD and how much was
not ?
I am asking for a reasonably accurate percentage e.g. 20% BSD, 80%
non-BSD, OR 85% BSD, 15% non-BSD. Something to that effect.
Comments/Code/Headers whatever originated from the BSD team gets
attributed to them, and the modifications you guys wrote are credited to
the GNU project.
Also, someone posted that the original GNU code was based on the BSD
code and therefore the BSD licence, and one fine day the BSD licence was
replaced with the GNU licence. Is that correct or incorrect ?
thanks,
Ranjeet Shetye.
