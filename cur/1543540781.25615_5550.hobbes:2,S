Fellow kernel coders,
As part of my research, I have been hacking the Linux kernel for quite a
while now (trying to introduce some experimental functionality), but
recently I have been facing a problem which I cannot resolve;  it feels
like banging my head against the wall and so I turn to you for help.  I
apologize for possible stupidity of the questions.
The problem is as follows:  the 2.2.15 TCP stack has been modified so that
(to describe in a very simplified way) multiple connections of a web
server start delivering data from the same data pool, once a special
switch/flag in tcp_opt has been set for a TCP socket.  The problem is,
once I start using these modified sockets to deliver the content from the
web server, after a while, for mysterious reasons, the webserver threads
one by one start blocking in accept() and never un-blocking.
Further investigation reveals that threads get stuck on the call to
wait_for_connect() after finding out that tcp_find_established() finds no
socket which would accept.  This is extremely strange, because I really
made no modifications whatsoever to the connection establishment
mechanism, and it really *should* work as before.
I understand that the modifications I made are far more extensive than
what could be discussed on the list, so I will limit myself to a few
simple questions which should greatly aid my debugging:
- What is the sequence of events (packet arrivals,
func. invocations)  which would normally cause tcp_find_established to
fail on account of syn_wait_queue being NULL at the moment of the call to 
tcp_accept()?
- What function in which  is responsible for waking up the thread
waiting in wait_for_connect()?  What is the call trace leading to the
invocation of that function?
Thanks for any help that you can offer
Stan Rost
