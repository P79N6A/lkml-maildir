cgroup hooks next to the lsm hooks.  So in fs/namei.c where there are
security_inode_permission() hooks, there would also be
cgroup_inode_permission() hooks to let the devices cgroup mediate the
access.  Well, in permission(), probably not in exec_permission_lite()
since that's probalby not a device access  :)
So far it looks like everyone likes that, so as long as you don't nack I
guess that'll be the way to go.
