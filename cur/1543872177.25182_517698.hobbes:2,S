the "vmware silicon" you are talking about /is/ the native hardware ABI! 
I never had any problems with /that/.

i'm worried about those "shot cuts" (which in essence create software 
variants of silicon), the hooks, the hardwirings combined with the 
hypervisor-side ABIs creating a rigid mess that is harmful to Linux. 
paravirt_ops and the hooks gives a license for all hypervisor 'backends' 
to deviate into random arbitrary directions and to create all their 
separate 'virtual silicon' playgrounds with no regard to Linux 
maintainability. And once this gets released, Linux has no choice but to 
play along.
