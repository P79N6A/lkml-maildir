Having this config option ass-backwards is mind-bogglingly confusing,
and there seems no real reason for it. John had a plan to just put 
in CONFIG_X86_PIT instead as the inverse of this, and delete 
CONFIG_X86_TSC. He seems to have gone off this idea for some reason
I can't understand ... I think it solves a lot of these issues ...
Having a config option called TSC that in fact has nothing to directly
do with the TSC, but disables the PIT seems silly. The first time I
read all this code I spend quite a while thinking it was all the 
incorrect, and the wrong way around ... things should be more intuitive
than that.
