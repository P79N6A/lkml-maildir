Andries' patch doesn't help at all and only makes things worse. Only very 
few drivers should have to deal with the major/minor business. Most 
drivers should just do add_serial_device/add_tape_device/... and these 
function will do the right thing (e.g. announce the new device via sysfs).

No, with my patch usb_open() and usb_minors[] could go away completely, 
you just setup everything in usb_register_dev() and the rest is done for 
you.
With Andries' patch you will not get rid of this.
