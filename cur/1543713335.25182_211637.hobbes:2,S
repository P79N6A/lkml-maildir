I'm all for it, this is how the 2.4 get_user_pages deals with bigpages
too, I've never enjoyed the compound thing.

see this patch:
	
http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.23aa2/9910_shm-largepage-18.gz
it's a two liner fix in follow_page:
@@ -439,6 +457,8 @@ static struct page * follow_page(struct
        pmd = pmd_offset(pgd, address);
        if (pmd_none(*pmd))
                goto out;
+       if (pmd_bigpage(*pmd))
+               return __pmd_page(*pmd) + (address & BIGPAGE_MASK) / PAGE_SIZE;
the BIGPAGE_MASK will never expose anything but the page->private to the
get_user_pages code, and handle_mm_fault takes care of doing the page
faults properly using larepages and pmds if the vma is marked
VM_BIGPAGE.
rawio on largepages has been a must-have feature (especially on >=32G)
for more than one year, definitely no need of compound slowdown for that.
Still I would like to understand what's wrong in Christoph's ppc machine
before dumping the whole compound thing.
