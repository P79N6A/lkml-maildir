Hi,
Basically I've encountered the same problem, but it went away after 2.4.6.
Machine: P II 300 Mhz, Adaptec 2940 SCSI adapter, 64 Mb memory, 1x Seagate 
ST34520W, 1x Seagate ST34520LW, 1x Philips CDD 3610, Toshiba XM-6201TA
OS: Redhat 7.1 with latest patches (except kernel)
Division over the buses as shown by cdrecord -scanbus
Scsibus0
           0.0.0           Seagate ST34520W
           0.2.0           Seagate ST34520LW
           0.5.0           Toshiba CD-ROM XM-6201TA
Scsibus1
           1.0.0           Philips CDD-3610 CD R/RW
and as stated everything fine after 2.4.6 (however 2.4.3-5 showed the same 
behaviour as your machine). The cd drive makes after 2.4.6 a strange churning 
sound when initializing cdrecord however. The cd's that were burned however 
were flawless (at least up to 2.4.9).
Further info: in the 2.4.3-2.4.5 kernels the devices which are above shown in 
scsibus0 were shown in scsibus1 and vice versa...
Sincerely, Erick
