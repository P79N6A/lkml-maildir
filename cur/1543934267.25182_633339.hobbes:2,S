Probably, since I also wasn't sure about this getting added to the
post-2.6.23 regressions. I'd expect this problem to be -mm only myself,
but then I didn't actively verify it in code (and I haven't tried -rc6
proper on that machine yet either, build takes ages ;).
OK, since I cannot really offer anything other than positive feelings about
this being non-rc6 breakage, should I try -rc6 proper, too?

.....even more confusion? :)
Thanks for your help,
