Ahh, it's _that_ old gcc problem. 
That's actually a different thing. 
Gcc is HORRIBLY BAD at doing the simple
	some_structure = (struct somestruct) { INITIAL };
assignments. It is so ludicrously bad that it's sad. It tends to do that 
as a local "struct somestruct" on the stack that gets initialized, 
followed by a memcpy().
In this case, the problem appears to be the spinlock initialization code.
In other words, I suspect 90% of your improvement was because you got that 
braindamage out of line.
It would be _much_  better to just fix "spin_lock_init()" instead. That 
would help a lot of _other_ users too, not just the waitqueue 
initializations.
Making that a real function (and inline only for the non-debug case, at 
which point it's just a simple and small store) would be much better.
