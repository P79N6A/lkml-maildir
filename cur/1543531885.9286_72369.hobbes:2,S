	So...scenario...suppose we have a Compartmented Mode Computer that 
enforces Mandatory Access.  Users who log in don't know about each other and
users at different clearance levels can't access the data of those above
them.  The sysadmin may administer's data but isn't rated to read or know
about processes own by those with higher sensitivity levels.  How can
anyone -- the sysadmin know that the President was logged in writing his
latest top-secret whatchamajigger.  Now mr. President doesn't know about
memory, but tries to read into an edit buffer a very large and secret file.
The viewer allocs
alot of space to hold the document in memory -- and it triggers *the memory
killer*.  "Prez" ain't running as SYSADMIN, he hasn't been running long, has
low CPU value...is maybe the largest process on the system.  Bang -- real
good candidate for being an evil memory hog targeted for termination by
the auto-killer.  Um...gee, sorry mr. prez.  But lets say in reading his
large file, the "reader" program is smart enough to know..."hmmm, I got
a NULL pointer from that malloc, maybe I'll page the rest of the file in
from disk later".  ...
	The point is you don't necessarily to hard code in memory "policy"
that kills processes.  Optional option?  Maybe yes...  But default behavior?
Yuck.  If we want Linux to become a "most trusted OS", having the kernel
automatically take non-requested actions on user-programs isn't a great idea.
