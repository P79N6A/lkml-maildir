this is a good sign that this is all very over designed :)
namespace pollution is perhaps evil, but we also should not overreact.
Especially for struct names. *IF* they are in a "narrow enough" header,
the user of the header knows what he is doing, and accepts these to be
in his namespace.
The problem is things like u64 etc that is VERY common in all headers,
but then again __u64 etc are just fine, history has proven that already.
