Hi,
Could someone to make clear next question:
I have one driver, but I need to run 4 instances of it (I run insmod with 
different parameters) .
But when I try to install the second driver I've got an error, that driver 
with this name exists.
How can I istall them? I don't want to use 4 different driver's sources.
Thank you,
Andrey
