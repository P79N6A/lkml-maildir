The prism2_usb driver is from the linux-wlan-ng project at
http://www.linux-wlan.com/linux-wlan/index.html#Download
This driver driver compiles OK under 2.6.3 and loads, but the problem is 
that the device is not recognised by the USB kernel subsystem before that..
Under 2.4.23 (and without loading the prism2_usb driver) I get the 
following output from #lsusb:
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 066b:2212 Linksys, Inc. WUSB11v2.5 802.11b Adapter
Under 2.6.3 I get:
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
