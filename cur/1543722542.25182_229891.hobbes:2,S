Subject: sys_gettimeofday racy or not?

This just happened to catch my eye and it's probably perfectly
valid, but if so please educate me on why it is. In kernel/time.c
sys_gettimeofday() there is this code:
        if (unlikely(tz != NULL)) {
                if (copy_to_user(tz, &sys_tz, sizeof(sys_tz)))
                        return -EFAULT;
        }
what prevents sys_tz from being changed while this code runs?
Wichert.
