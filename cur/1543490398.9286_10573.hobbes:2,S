I can only offer this.  I have been using posix threads for almost 2
years, starting on kernel 2.0.32, going thru many of the 2.1 kernels
including almost all from 2.1.97 on, and then 2.2.0/1/2/3 as well.
The applications receive _no_ changes in moving them from one version
to the next, because nothing on the 'user-side' has changed, except
that performance has picked up a bit.
If you have something that uses posix threads, it should run on
_everything_ including even Solaris.  If you use traditional non-posix-
threads things like fork/mmap/shmat/etc (your choice for how to get at
shared memory, I have used mmap and the shmget/shmat with equal ease
and success) then you might occasionally run into something odd if you
use some specific linux things.  IE if you depend on fork() to be _very_
fast, you will be happy under linux, but not under other flavors of
unix.
