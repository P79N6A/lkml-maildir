Correct. :) In fact, text mode can only take a maximum of the first 256KB of
memory of the card (extended text paging). So as long as you only target the
rest of the memory (and don't use X or svgalib) you should be fine.

Not that I'm aware of. This is PCI-mapped prefetchable memory.

Yeah. In fact in some responses the 'slow speed' consideration was so much that
they all say I'd be better off writing a block driver and making use of the
memory more as a swap device rather than as system RAM.
Has anyone out there done this yet? I figure I'd ask before reinventing
anything.. :)
