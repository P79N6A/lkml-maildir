No, we are speaking about sysfs access to the ROM and the driver itself
is unable to predict whether anybody will ever want to use that sysfs file,
so it would have to cache always.
Do I understand it correctly that the ROM-in-sysfs hack is intended only
for debugging? If it is so, I do not see why we should do anything complicated
in order to avoid root shooting himself in the foot.
				Have a nice fortnight
