I wasn't aware of that.

Of course if you replace the buffer with a copy of it, then you can live
with only the two R/W per-CPU kmaps.
But what I was talking about was to preserve zero-copy to do real I/O on
bigmem pages by kmapping all the buffers as far as they was entering the
ll_rw_block layer without copying them.

To use kmap from irq handlers with irq enabled we'll waste 31 mbyte of
virtual memory space.

It would be nice to do a cleanup of the interface and to drop req->buffer.
The fixage of the drivers (at least in theory) should be trivial.
