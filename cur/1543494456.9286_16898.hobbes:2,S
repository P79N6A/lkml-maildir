Look at www.x86.org.  There is a rather complete code base on how to
distinguish early x86 CPU's depending on what bugs and/or undocumented
features are present.  The code is even capable of distingusishing between
80(1)86 and 80(1)88 by doing tricks with the prefetch queue, also that has
(at least at the moment) little pertinence in the context of running Linux.
