then those modules should be submitted realistically. That's just best
for everyone involved. Which modules in particular do you mean btw?
It's rare even in the 2.6 tree to mass-break well written drivers. Just
because it's a lot of work to fix all in kernel drivers up. But a fully
stable API is also not good. My guess is that the drivers that break
most are the ones using the not-right APIs (eg internals and such).
