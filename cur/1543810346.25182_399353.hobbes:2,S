Arnaldo apparently wants to fix it differently, but maybe you could help
us with conntrack :) CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK and CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK
should be mutually exclusive. Specifying
CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK
	depends on CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK=n
CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK
	depends on CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK=n
will avoid asking for NF_CONNTRACK when IP_NF_CONNTRACK is set, but not
the other way around.
