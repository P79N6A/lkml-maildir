Indeed, the attached patch is implemented according to the suggestion.
The code for legacy-386 is used only when boot_cpu_data.x86 == 3.
This run-time check is done only when CONFIG_M386 is set.
Otherwise, we use 'XADD' operation for atomic_add_return()
as the previous patch.
I don't adopt the alternative(), because the macro doesn't fit for the situation
when arguments for __asm__ are necessary.
Thanks.
