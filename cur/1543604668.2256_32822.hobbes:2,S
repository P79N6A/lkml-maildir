I'm searching the hp-parisc doc about it but it seems that even Paul
McKenney pointed out this.
Suppose that  p  and  *p  are on two different cache partitions and the
invalidation order that comes from the wmb() cpu is 1) *p  2) p
Suppose that the partition when  *p  lies is damn busy and the one where
p  lies is free.
The reader cpu could pickup the value of  p  before the value of  *p  by
reading the old value of  a
The barrier on the reader side should establish a checkpoint that enforce
the commit of  *p  before  p
