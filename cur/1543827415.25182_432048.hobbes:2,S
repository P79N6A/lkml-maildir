I've had other usages of this : when booting kernels from PXE, it is
very convenient to have default command line arguments in different
images, and not have to modify anything in the boot loader. Moreover,
using a *default* command line allows the boot loader to override the
arguments while it would not be easy from the initramfs. Last but not
least, disabling sensible features such as ACPI/APIC needs to be
performed before initramfs.
Cheers,
