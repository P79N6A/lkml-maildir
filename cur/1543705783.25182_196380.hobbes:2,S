hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
multcount = 16 (on)
IO_support = 1 (32-bit)
unmaskirq = 1 (on)
using_dma = 1 (on)
keepsettings = 0 (off)
readonly = 0 (off)
readahead = 256 (on)
geometry = 30401/255/63, sectors = 488397168, start = 0
tried with hdparm -a8192 /dev/hda, not much different
/dev/hdc same as /dev/hda
