Ah, okay.
It's just because free_area[] is not initaialized at all if this is not called.
It is list.next and list.prev has bad value.
Then, the first free_page(page) will cause panic.

When node 0's higmem size is 0 at boot time, I have to add new page into empty zone.
This happens because my machine has only 700M mem.
I use mem=500M and hot add extra 200M memory for testing.
"Nobody needs " is sane in real world. But it's useful to my tiny test enveironment.
Could you spin out initializing free_area[] from
init_currently_empty_zone(zone, zone_start_pfn, size);
Then I'll be happy.
