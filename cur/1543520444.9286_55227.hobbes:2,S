This is _exactly_ what is happening. I have even tried another webserver 
(Mathopd) which resulted in the same kind of crashes, so this suggests that 
it is not in particular an Apache problem (unless Mathopd has borrowed 
source from Apache...). I have another machine that runs a heavily loaded 
mail/ftp server on a 2.2.13pre17, standing right next to the problematic 
box, and that has a 70+ days uptime. No webserver, no problem, it seems. 
There is one funny thing about the webserver setup, it has 33000 symbolic 
links in the document root, pointing to the users homedirs. I am going to 
change this, as I don't like it (I didn't set it up). But it will still 
take some time to upgrade. I wonder if this could have something to do with it.
David, what hardware are you running on? Mine is an HP Kayak Workstation 
with dual P350 II processor, but running a UP kernel.
Ward.
