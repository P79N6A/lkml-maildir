hi,
I have observed this problem for several months, every time I run 
e2fsck on my filesystems i get the following output:
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'showq' in 
/spool/postfix/public (45244) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'cleanup' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'rewrite' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'bounce' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'defer' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'smtp' in /spool/postfix/private (100745)
to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'error' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'local' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'cyrus' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'uucp' in /spool/postfix/private (100745)
to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'ifmail' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: Setting filetype for entry 'bsmtp' in 
/spool/postfix/private (100745) to 6.
/dev/hda7: 3665/102800 files (1.6% non-contiguous), 69820/409601 blocks
these are all socket files.
note this is only my /var filesystem, I also get the same messages on 
/tmp for xfs socket files, and occasionally the root filesystem for 
/dev/log (but oddly enough / is the only filesystem to not 
consistently show this problem) so I do not think it has anything to 
do with postfix, it just happens to create the most socket files.
now if i drop to single user mode fsck /var i get those errors, if a 
fsck a second time its clean.  go back to multiuser mode, then 
immediately drop back to single, run fsck again the errors return...
I have seen this behavior under kernel 2.2.12, 2.2.13, and 2.2.14 on 
two separate x86 based machines (one Pentium the other a celeron 466) 
and on a PowerPC G3.  I have used e2fs utils 1.17 and 1.18 currently. 
all systems are running Debian `potato'.
