miniconfig actually does something completely different as far as I
understand: miniconfig creates a minimal config that does not contain
default choices for CONFIG_ files, while the patch that I was trying
to submit here allows to override entries in a .config by just
appending them to the file. I already have a miniconfig, so to speak,
and want to merge it with the previous .config so as to produce a
fullconfig. (Something like the exact opposite)
thanks,
Jan
