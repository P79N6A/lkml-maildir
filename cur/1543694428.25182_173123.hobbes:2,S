With the exception of NUL blocks i doubt there is much
savings at any level below the file.  That is, only a tiny
fraction of files that are not fully duplicate of one
another will share many aligned blocks.
Now detecting files that are duplicates and linking them in
some way might be a useful in a low-priority daemon.  But
the links created would have to be sure to preserve them as
seperate inodes so that overwrites break the loose link but
not the user-created hardlink.
