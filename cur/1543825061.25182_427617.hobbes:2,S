Yes, indeed, I should've added "i" inside the CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER block.

I'm actually thinking about removing the conditional compilation on
DEBUG_FS and just mandate this option. At the moment there is no other
way to find the memory leaks apart from /sys/kernel/debug/memleak. The
other option would be to scan the memory periodically from a timer or
kernel thread and print the findings.
