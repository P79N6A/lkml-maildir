This doesn't look like the right fix for the oops you were seeing. The
SAS usage of libata has ap->scsi_host as NULL, which indicates that
libata does not own the associated scsi_host. I'm concerned you may
have broken some other code path by making this change. I think the correct
fix may require removing the dependence of ap->scsi_host from
ata_dev_config_ncq.
