Who's referring to the "From: " address? I was referring to the
"From " address (ie, the ENVELOPE FROM address) that says where the
mail came from, and certainly if I was to write software to bounce an
email, that's where I would expect to bounce it to.

You can presumably explain why your message to linux-kernel (the one
I'm replying to right now) has no such line in its headers, even
though the "Received" chain clearly shows that it went through vger
on its way here?

If so, his wording is best described as "unfortunate".
My reading of his message was that he was asking how best to deal with
one particular site that was bouncing emails he'd written to a mailing
list that had one particular person thereon as a subscriber. In my
experience, the ONLY answer to that is to unsubscribe the said person
from the mailing list, and leave them to sort out their resubscription
as and when.
If one really wants to exhaust every contact avenue, one could always
email postmaster@wherever and hope it (a) doesn't bounce, and (b) is
read by a human being rather than the usual auto-responder software.
It's years since I met a postmaster account that qualified.
Best wishes from Riley.
