go and check out the mailinglist archive. This is one of the most frequently
asked questions.
IPv6 currently has no clean code to remove itself from the network stack,
so it is setting the reference count to -1 to ensure it is _never_ unloaded.
Your next question might be: Why is it a module at all?
Because we want to keep the kernel footprint as small as possible.
