Or because they did 'allmodconfig' or 'allyesconfig'. Whenever I build
a kernel I enabled everything possible as a module in case I ever need
it. For instance, a few weeks ago I had the reiserfs module loaded because
I was testing something, if I had klive running it would have said that I
use reiserfs when in fact I don't.
