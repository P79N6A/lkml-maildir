Ok, test count and exit if count is zero.
I take it that this move is the copy of the dst to a temporary variable?

Test *s and exit if zero.

Fetch *s and increment.  This is redundant.  Why didn't it know to fetch 
  *s above and keep it in a register?

Test count and exit if count is zero.  Why is it doing this again?  Why 
not jump back to the top?  Oh, wait... in that case, for the loop to 
exit, it would jump to the top and then jump back to past the end, 
rather than just failing one branch.
I see that the delay slot was filled with the store to *dst.  But is 
there also some pipeline latency that makes this worth while?

Test *src AGAIN and loop if nonzero.  Redundant.

Test count and bypass if zero.  Also, copy dst.

Move data

Interesting how (a) it moved the increment to the test, and (b) it makes 
a redundant read of the dest.
Does this arch not get condition codes from things other than test and 
compare?
And why didn't it test $r13 instead?  Wouldn't that have been a lot more 
efficient?

Exit on zero and decrement count.

Why does it do that?  Is that somehow more optimal?  Why doesn't it test 
BEFORE it decrements?  Isn't that more straightforward?
In any event, couldn't that be fixed by moving the decrement into the loop?

And what I was saying was that since what the while should test is the 
value before the decrement, I assumed that the test would be before the 
decrement.

A decent optimizer should know that the "n--" and the "*s++ = *s2++" are 
independent and migrate them to optimal positions.
Furthermore, I put the "n--" first because I assumed that the compiler 
might be stupid about it.  The idea is to order the statements so that 
the results of a given instruction are being computed while the next one 
is being decoded.
My assumption was that the code would branch back to the loop test 
(rather than make a second one) at the end of the loop and then test n. 
  Therefore, decrementing n earlier would be a win in terms of having 
the result earlier for the test, reducing pipline stall.
