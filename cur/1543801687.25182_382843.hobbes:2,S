Ingo,
Would you mind submitting this for 2.6.16?  We already have one case
where it would have caught a regression in time for 2.6.15, so IMHO this
would be a great addition to "Kernel hacking".
I have had absolutely no problems running this with 2.6.15-rc7, it works
perfectly, as it has in the -rt tree for ages.
