I mean how CPU time is distributed not only in the case of CPU hogs. For 
example, when 2 tasks do cyclic 1 byte transfer via pipe. one of them is 
awake, while another goes to sleep.
If both are in one container, will they behave like a CPU hog?

It's a pity... :( We have fair CPU scheduler in OpenVZ project, so it's 
quite an interesting approach for us.
