On my system, this produces
/bin/sh: -w: bad option
(/bin/sh is GNU bash 1.14.7(1)) and besides, to quote from 'man perlrun':
	"If the #! line does not contain the word "perl", the
	program named after the #! is executed instead of the Perl
	interpreter." [perl 5.004_01]
So this would never work, nor would the "continued comment" trick they use
with Tcl.
