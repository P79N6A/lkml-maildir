I recently came across a good article in Linux Journal by Robert Love that
explains how to allocate memory in the kernel and the various options you
have.
The article was called "Allocating Memory in the Kernel" and appeared in
the December 2003 issue. You can also find it online here:

Hope this helps you.
Kind regards,
