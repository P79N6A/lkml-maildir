Are you sure?
I have seen it occur immediately after hot-removal
of a drive.  There have been other structural changes
since then, so perhaps it is no longer possible,
but I'd rather have the test there than have the
kernel ooops again.  If you feel strongly about it,
then away it goes.

Give us an interface for it, please.
In the meanwhile, gone!

SG_IO is incompatible with current user-mode toolsets.
Once that interface becomes more mature, and the distributions
gradually get updated with newer versions of the tools,
then the HDIO_ stuff can go (as per the comments in the source).
For now, it is essential for hdparm and smartmontools, among others.
Alternatively, as Jeff has suggested, we may be able to implement
a generic HDIO_ mechanism in libata that re-issues the commands
through SG_IO (perhaps that is what you meant).  Is that there now?

So just nuke the _info() proc, and use .name = QS_DESC ?
Okay, done.

Good -- I hadn't noticed that new interface before.
It's quite hard to find all of this stuff first time through,
as there are practically no existing drivers that don't have
many of the same comments applicable to them.
Perhaps this will be one of the first/few drivers
to become totally compliant with the latest kernel APIs.
Cheers
