I'm confused.  For every block device queue, there is one unique
elevator_t structure allocated via kmalloc.  And vice versa, one
elevator_t has only one request_queue points to it. This elevator_t
structure is per q since it has pointer to per-queue elevator
private data.
Since it is always one to one relationship, ref count is predictable
and static.  I see there are ref count on q->elevator, But it is
always 2: one from object instantiation and one from adding an sysfs
hierarchy directory.  In this case, I don't see the difference.
Am I missing something?
