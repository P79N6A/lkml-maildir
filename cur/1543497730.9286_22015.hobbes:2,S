Worst case, yes.. spring for the extra 50 cents for an extra CD in the set.
But, as Linus says, how many laptops come with only 8MB these days?
Regardless, the initrd image does NOT have to have all of that junk
on it.  It just has to have enough to access the CDROM, from which
it can mount/read any additional files.
