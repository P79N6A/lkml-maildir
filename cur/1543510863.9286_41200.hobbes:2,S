If you say so.  Regardless of how much you don't like the way it was
said, the point remains: source management systems which don't provide
integrity checks, when it is known that such checks are needed, especially
because without them the users won't know that the data is bad, those
source management systems are bad, bad, bad.
As to your argument that this doesn't need to be in the application,
I happen to think you are wrong.  So does Red Hat, for that matter, 
run rpm --verify lately?  It's got the same sort of thing built in.
Perhaps you should start a crusade to get it removed, it's obviously
not useful according to, in your world nothing ever goes wrong.

Sorry about that, I'll try harder.  Really, I promise.

Pick one of your backups and go extract every old version and try and
build it.  Give us some status on whether they all worked.  If you have
a shred of intellectual integrity (see, I'm trying harder), you'll admit
it when you find out you've been backing up corrupted data.  And I'll
bet you 40 BK licenses that when you find out that there is bad data in
there, you can't find the right tape to correct it.  Because remember,
you've got 5 years of backups and no way of know when in those five
years things got screwed up.
In 10 or more messages you've failed to get the point.  Doing backups of
bad data is not very useful.  How the hell do you know that you need to
restore from tape if the system never tells you that anything is wrong?
RCS / CVS store the latest version in clear text - every earlier version
could be completely corrupted and you'll cluelessly (through no fault of
your own) be backing up, mirroring, raiding, and CDROM burning COMPLETE
AND UTTER GARBAGE.  Which you won't find out until you need to get an
_OLD_ version to fix a bug.
See the problem?  Backing up corrupted bits is of no help.  Having a 
source management system which doesn't tell you when they are corrupted,
and has no means to tell you that, is completely insane and, yes, people
who advocate this should certainly NOT have any part in designing a
source management system.  Sorry, I won't budge on that one.  No sane 
person would.  No person with an ounce of responsibility would.

Exactly.  So what are you going to do when you realize that it broke
5 years ago and that code, which you swore up and down was worthless,
you'd never need to go back to it, now you need it and you need it bad?

You are at a good university; perhaps they have a copy of an old but
famous paper by Dave Clark on end-to-end error checking.  Read it.
If you can't find it, I'll fax you a copy.  Then think about how much
use those mirrored disks are going to be if the page cache is busted and
puts the wrong page in the file, or you have an undetected memory error,
or the bus corrupts, or any of the many other errors occur.   Once again,
you're mirroring GARBAGE.  And the source system, which could have warned
you about this, didn't.

You use CVS.  You're advocating another system which uses the same broken
file format.  In fact, I've just gone over the entire thread and 100%
of the places you mention something specific, it's RCS based.  Forgive
me for listening to you, it won't happen again.

Sheesh.  If I had read this first, I wouldn't have bothered replying.
So you whine and whine and whine and then when I say that your recourse
is exactly what you have been holding up as the perfect answer, you
whine some more.
Jeeze, I'm sorry Nat.  I didn't realize your importance.  Let me get
Cindy Crawford on plane in the morning with 10,000 copies of BitKeeper
plus a check for $50,000,000 made out to you personally.  Because I want
you to be happy.  Really.
