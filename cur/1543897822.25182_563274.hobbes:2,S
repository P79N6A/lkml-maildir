I think the fundamental difference is that fsblock still does:
mapping_info = page->something, where something is attached on a per
page basis.  What we really want is mapping_info = lookup_mapping(page),
where that function goes and finds something stored on a per extent
basis, with extra bits for tracking dirty and locked state.
Ideally, in at least some of the cases the dirty and locked state could
be at an extent granularity (streaming IO) instead of the block
granularity (random IO).
In my little brain, even block based filesystems should be able to take
advantage of this...but such things are always easier to believe in
before the coding starts.

Could be, but the fundamental issue of sometimes pages have mappings
attached and sometimes they don't is still there.  The window is
smaller, but non-zero.
