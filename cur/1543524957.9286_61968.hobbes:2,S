This is what happens when a bunch of 20+ years old guys suddenly get
rich.  It's the Marc Andressan Syndrome at NetScape all over again, it's
like they're all 18 years old, and they just got their first piece of
ass or something -- it drives them crazy, then they go nuts -- then
comes the arrogance, conceit, and "I'll get you" behavior.  Look how
Alan reacted ("I'll get you Merkey").  
This isn't the Alan Cox I used to know -- the one that went out of his
way to put Linux first and was the good samaritan of Linux Kernel.  I
think all the money is making folks a little nuts, and we are seeing the
natural fallout of this -- hell, these guys are all under 30 (most of
them). I think Linux is close to the point that it will fragment and
break into many smaller efforts.  I can feel it starting.
