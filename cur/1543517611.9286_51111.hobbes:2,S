Ok, today one of our machines connected to the net using ppp, seemed
to get disconnected from the net, in such a way that pppd didn't
register that it had happened, hence the box didn't reconnect. 
I'm not sure whether this is a problem with the ppp module, or the
pppd program, so any help would be appreciated. 
The machine has Redhat 6.0 installed, running kernel 2.2.5, and pppd is 2.3.10.
The relevant excerpt from /var/log/messages is:
Dec  2 08:50:51 cuttlefish modprobe: can't locate module ppp-compress-24
Dec  2 09:30:00 cuttlefish kernel: PPP: ppp line discipline successfully unregis
tered
Dec  2 17:11:35 cuttlefish pppd[2405]: Terminating on signal 15.

versity of California
Dec  2 17:11:35 cuttlefish kernel: PPP: version 2.3.3 (demand dialling)
Dec  2 17:11:35 cuttlefish kernel: PPP line discipline registered.
Dec  2 17:11:35 cuttlefish pppd[2405]: ioctl(SIOCSIFMTU): No such device(19)
Dec  2 17:11:35 cuttlefish pppd[2405]: tcflush failed: Input/output error
Dec  2 17:11:36 cuttlefish xfs: xfs shutdown succeeded
Dec  2 17:11:36 cuttlefish pppd[2405]: Exit.
As can be seen, at 8:50, the machine connects to the net, and everything is 
fine, at 9:30, the ppp module is unloaded from the kernel, yet pppd doesn't
terminate until 5:11 in the afternoon (triggered by me rebooting the machine)
whereupon it encounters various errors due to the ppp module unregistering it's
network device. 
This may be (read is almost definitely) due to the server at the other end of
the line being reset at 9:30 (I don't know what it is exactly, probably a Cisco 
of some flavour though, I can find out if it's important), but as I see it, 
it shouldn't cause this behaviour.
Any help would be appreciated.
