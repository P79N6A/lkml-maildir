Hello!

This must not happen with stock 2.4.0. TCP never returns ENOMEM.
Please, investigate.
But application should be ready to get this error yet.

The only constructive way to handle this is to fail instantly
and to release all the allocated resources as soon as possible,
avoiding operations requiring allocating new resources.

It never will if you do not abort something.
It is in theory. In practice, write() on TCP returns EAGAIN on
transient errors and application will spin, which is normal.
