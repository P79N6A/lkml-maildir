2.5 and 2.5-mm are very different in this area.  You did not specify.

This is why 2.5.41-mm2 has improved writer throttling, and it's
why it adjusts the throttling threshold down when the amount
of mapped memory is high.

Yes, that happens quite a lot.

It does.  The throttling of write(2) callers is a critical part
of the VM.   Large amounts of dirty data cause lots of problems.
