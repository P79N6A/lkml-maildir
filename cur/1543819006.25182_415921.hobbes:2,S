Hi,
In linux/include/asm-mips/system.h:__cmpxchg_u64(), one can read
	if (cpu_has_llsc) {
		asm(stuff with beqzl);
	} else if (cpu_has_llsc) {
		asm(stuff with beqz);
	} else {
		C code;
	}
There's no test for "LLSC_WAR", is that on purpose? (i.e.. is beqzl
always needed rather than beqz?)
Regards,
Samuel
