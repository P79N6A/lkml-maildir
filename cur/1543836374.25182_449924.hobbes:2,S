Hey Leo,
I personally use the mercurial tree hosted on kernel.org
(
http://www.kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6
).  Alternatively, you can use git to
access the latest tree.

Andrew Morton is good about pulling in the IOMMU patches as soon as we
push them.  So the -mm kernel is an option.  Andi also queues up the
patches in his firstfloor repository.  So you can pull the patches from
there.
So, if you can't wait for the latest kernel and don't want to
get the latest kernel and patch it with Andi's patches on firstfloor,
then the mm kernel will be the best option.  But, the mercurial tree I
mentioned above should be sufficient.
Thanks,
Jon
