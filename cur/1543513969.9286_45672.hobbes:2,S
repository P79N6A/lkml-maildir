Since we are moving to an SMP kernel, and since we dropped locks in other places
around other FS operations, wouldn't it be more consistent and cleaner coding to
not lock any call before the FS gets passed it?

Get Linux (
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS
 (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
