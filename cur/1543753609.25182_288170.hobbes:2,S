Hello,
here is a set of fixes for ext3 in-inode attributes:
patches/ea-xattr-nolock.diff
  No lock needed when freeing inode
  The effect of the additional lock taking is very minor, but
  it's still unnecessary.
patches/ea-xattr-update-sb.diff
  Set the EXT3_FEATURE_COMPAT_EXT_ATTR for in-inode xattrs
  The EXT_ATTR filesystem feature was set for xattr blocks, but not
  for in-inode attributes.
patches/ea-xattr-doc.diff
  Documentation fix
patches/ea-xattr-no-extra_isize.diff
  Fix i_extra_isize check
  Filesystem corruption fix.
patches/ea-xattr-reserved-inodes.diff
  Disallow in-inode attributes for reserved inodes
  Filesystem corruption fix.
Regards,
