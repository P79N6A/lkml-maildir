It's not quite that simple.  I need to impose *two* security labels in
cachefiles_begin_secure() when I'm about to act on behalf of a process that's
tried to access a netfs file:
 (1) The security label to act as.  This is the label attached to the
     cachefilesd process when it starts the cache.  This is obtained by
     cachefiles_get_security_ID().
 (2) The security label to create files as.  This is the label attached to
     root directory of the cache.  This is obtained by
     cachefiles_determine_cache_secid().
