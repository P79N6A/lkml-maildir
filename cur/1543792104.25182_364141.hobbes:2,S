I don't think so because if the cpuset can be freed, then its page
might be unmapped from the kernel address space if use-after-free
debugging is turned on. And this is a use after free :)
Also, it may be reused for something else far into the future without
having its value changed - is this OK?
Anyway, I think the first problem is a showstopper. I'd look into
Hugh's SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU for this, which sounds like a good fit
if you need to go down this path (although I only had a quick skim
over the cpusets code).
