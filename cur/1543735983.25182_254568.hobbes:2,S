Yup. What would be a good interface for setting that flag per-process? 
prctl()?
Personally, I'd prefer it without userspace having to write code for it.
Also, it should be able to protect against a DoS where a user launches N 
un-OOM-killable processes.

Nope, it's the binary path len, so PATH_MAX maybe.
