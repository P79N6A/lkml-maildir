Btw. I tried mxverify script on my SMTP.
At the bottom it says:
Testing server at address: IPv6 3ffe:8320:2:18::57
ERROR: Failed to create AF_INET6 type socket! err='Address family not
supported by protocol'
I am IP6 enabled, so is my SMTP, so it appears that host the script is
running is not ip6 enabled.
Just letting you know.
Regards,
Maciej
