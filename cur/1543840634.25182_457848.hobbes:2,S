No, that doesn't make sense. They are two different things and both will
stay.
/sys/device is the kernel device tree, modeled by the stacking of
drivers and subsystems inside the kernel. It expresses the hierarchy and
dependency of devices, but no classification.
/sys/class is the classification/grouping of devices, it will not
express any hierarchy.
In the end, after the transition of directories in /sys/class to
symlinks, /sys/class will only be flat lists of symlinks grouped by
subsytems. The symlinks will point to the actual device locations in
the /sys/devices tree.
