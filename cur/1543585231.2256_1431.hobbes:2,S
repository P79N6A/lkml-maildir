I don't remember where I saw it, but I'm sure there is a program
which runs on Linux as well as Win32 that improves the data
capacity of floppies by using one of several possible strategies.
If I remember correctly it is capable of reaching close to 2.0 Mb
of useful space. I tried a search on the internet but was unable
to find it. 
Before beginning to code, remember to look for what you need. If
it's anything close to reasonable, you have a nine out of ten
chance that someone, somewhere, has already done it for you.
If you actually find it, send me a link to its URL, please.
