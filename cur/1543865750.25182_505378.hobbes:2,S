Want to know how to make incompatibility? "Ask me How!(tm)".
Regarding ACPI, please see Linus at first,
<

And then, are you sure MSACPI will be compatible with any competitor
in near future?

Do you mean: with all possible crutches?
I'm very upset, that hardware nvidia-lego forces system software (and
programmers) to know "unfortunately no standard" ways of desinging
things... One read-only-for-os, hardware set bit in kind of control
register isn't possible at all, tphu. BDU market (BDU=brain dead user),
which Microsoft dominates, makes BDD (... designers ;)

No, you don't.
Do you know, why top posting is bad?
