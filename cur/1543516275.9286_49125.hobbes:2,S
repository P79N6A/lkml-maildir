Hello,
I checked the if_arp.h file and ARPHRD_IEEE802_TR isn't defined, but
ARPHRD_IEEE802 is and according to the comment, it appears that
ARPHRD_IEEE802 is what its supposed to be...just a typo.
net_init.c: In function `tr_configure`:
net_init.c:443: `ARPHRD_IEEE802_TR` undeclared (first use in this
function)
Below is the patch:
