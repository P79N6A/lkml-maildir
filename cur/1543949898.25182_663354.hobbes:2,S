Agreed.

And even then, we need a network interface in the kernel, which would
possibly support wireless extensions.
And most importantly, I don't think anyone will bother rewriting
ndiswrapper.  It's a popular project amongst users, but it suffers from
little attention of developers.

Agreed.

Yes.

Nice to hear that.

To recap:
1) USB API
2) Workqueue API (there is a hackish replacement in ndiswrapper)
3) task_nice(), but I have a trivial workaround for that.

Let me explain my position.  Using of GPL-only symbols by ndiswrapper
has been tolerated for years.  The change was not even intended to stop
it.  It was a side effect.
As it stands now, I don't want to be in the position to ask anyone to
add extra support to recognize ndiswrapper or to have some ugly
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_OR_NDISWRAPPER.
Believe me, I don't want to be uncooperative.  But I think I'll be in
the position to ask for exceptions for ndiswrapper only if somebody is
actively and _intentionally_ looking to prevent it from using GPL-only
symbols.  That's why if nothing changes in the kernel, ndiswrapper will
be renamed.  This way we'll see if anyone actually cares enough to block
ndiswrapper again.  And in this situation, I'll be in a better position
to ask authors of the workqueue API and USB for an explicit exception.
