No. By removing the directory entry completely and marking the inode
unused.
By the way, there used to be undelete tool for ext2. It created a list
of deleted inodes with correct stat, but no names, only their inode
numbers. You could then pick the corect inode and give it a name, thus
bringing it back to life. Since ext3 is just ext2 with journal, I guess
it might work. It existed as a standalone tool and integrated to
midnight commander.
