Looks good. Do you want to continue this ? That would be great !
I will be busy for a while improving mkkrl in its simple version without
autodetection. So, when you start the autodetection part we could
combine both in a few weeks. What do you think about it ?
Besides, in my /proc/ioports you have to look for 'parport' not 'lp'.

There will be always some settings that have to be done manually, but at
least you could find out, which are the POSSIBLE values and only ask to
choose from them.
In this special case: Do you have an internal modem ? I don't know much
about the internal ones. But as far as I know most of these devices are
registered one way or the other in your BIOS and we should be able to
get these informations from there and NOT from the user.

When it becomes to hard I will keep in mind that other people might
extend the script for the other ports and stick to i386.
By the way. I haven't got ANY idea how things work on other
architectures on hardware level ...
