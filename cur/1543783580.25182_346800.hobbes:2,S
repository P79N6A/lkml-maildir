I don't have the impression you understood what Andrew wrote.
dev->block_ucfg_access = 1 is essentially an atomic operation.
AFAIK, Use of the pci_lock doesn't solve any race conditions that mb()
wouldn't solve.
If you had:
	spin_lock_irqsave(&pci_lock, flags);
	pci_save_state(dev);
	dev->block_ucfg_access = 1;
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&pci_lock, flags);
Then I could buy your arguement since the flag now implies
we need to atomically save state and set the flag.
