Correct.

Only if INPCK is set.  If it's clear, then it will ignore framing and
parity errors.  (Irrespective of this, it will still internally count
them for statistical purposes, just like 2.4 used to.)
However, since INPCK is clear (from the info Jean's already sent) you'll
receive the character a TTY_NORMAL flag, even though the hardware flagged
an error.

Maybe the problem is that you want to discard the bad byte (by flagging
it with a non-TTY_NORMAL flag.)
