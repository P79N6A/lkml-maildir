When I hit the problem originally I was using an FTDI device. I've
tested it on multiple 3 linux machine machine: Ubuntu Dapper (kernel
2.6.15), Fedora Core 2 (dunno what kernel but surely older that
2.6.15) and Debian Etch (with 2.6.20 and 2.6.21) and all of then gave
me corrupted data (while windows gave correct data). So all these
kernel have this (or a related) problem.
