Hi,
I wrote a pseudo character driver and one of the minor number operations
is pipe implementation. It works fine with my test program. But when I try
to remove the device, I am not able to do it. It says "Device or Resource
busy". Please tell me when this error comes. I have to reboot the machine
to remove that file.
Please get back with your valuable suggestions.
Thanks in advanvce,
Warm regards,
sathish.j
