Subject: [PATCH] Use a zero-size array in the struct devres
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Commit 9ac7849e35f705830f7b016ff272b0ff1f7ff759 adds the devres
structure containing a flexible unsigned long long array, with a
comment about the guaranteed alignment. According to the gcc manual,
flexible arrays are considered incomplete types and it is an error to
ask for their alignment. This patch makes data[] a zero-size array.

I came across this when trying to build kmemleak as the modified
container_of macro tries to get the size of the devres.data member and
sizeof cannot be applied to incomplete types.
