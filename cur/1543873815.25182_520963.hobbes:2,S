Yes, I don't think any 32-bit userspace expects a fixed address any
more.  64-bit is another matter.

Correct.

Good point.  It would be good to reuse that machinery.

Yes.  The plan is to map the relocated compat vdso at some fixed address
in all processes, and map a non-relocated non-compat vdso at some
randomized address (it will probably be the same bits in either case). 
We could map a relocated vdso to a randomized address (ie, only one vdso
mapping), but that would require a per-process copy of the vdso and
effort to relocate on each exec.

We did that in an earlier version of the patch, and Ingo complained,
with some justification.

FC1 and SuSE 9 both shipped with broken glibcs which require
weak-COMPAT_VDSO (not fixed address, but pre-relocated).  There are
still enough of these around that we need to cater to them.
