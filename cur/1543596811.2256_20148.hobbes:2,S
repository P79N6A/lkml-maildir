Not related. Somebody decided that it was too expensive to
keep track of shared memory usage so this field has been blank
for some time now.
Of course, the shared memory usage could be calculated by
the task that accesses the /proc file-system so the reason
cited above could go away. The cost would be that it wastes
a whole page of memory, but memory is plentiful now-a-days.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (799.53 BogoMips).
    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
