This operation cannot use /proc/<pid>/mem  as there is a "read" from
the virtual file system that has to write the buffer value into the
ptraced process ("cp") memory.
Let us try the reverse op.
****OLD WAY
Umview+unreal test module/NO PTRACE_MULTI/NO PTRACE_SYSVM (PTRACE, old
way)
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /unreal/tmp
real    0m16.039s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.208s
****YOUR PROPOSAL WITHOUT/WITH SYSVM (that patch is independent).
Umview+unreal test module/NO PTRACE_MULTI/NO PTRACE_SYSVM (using
/proc/<pid>/mem)
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /unreal/tmp
real    0m1.649s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.172s
Umview+unreal test module/NO_PTRACE_MULTI PTRACE_SYSVM (using
/proc/<pid>/mem)
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /unreal/tmp
real    0m1.185s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.188s
****OUR PROPOSAL (PTRACE_MULTI instead of /proc/<pid>/mem (WO/W SYSVM)
Umview+unreal test module PTRACE_MULTI/NO PTRACE_SYSVM
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /unreal/tmp
real    0m1.500s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.244s
Umview+unreal test module PTRACE_MULTI/PTRACE_SYSVM
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /unreal/tmp
real    0m0.983s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.148s
All the experiments have been done three times. This is the best time
(always the third); the results would have had the same significance
taking the first or the second run figures, the difference in time would have
been a bit higher.
Anyway I think I'll put this possibility (to use /proc/<pid>/mem) inside umview 
source code.
It is a speedup for umview on unpatched kernel, just a one way speedup,
but it can help. Thank you for the hint.
I think that our patch(es) would be useful anyway as the solution you
propose is not a solution at all.
In the best approximation this is a workaround that covers part of the
problems with almost the same (a bit poorer) performance.
