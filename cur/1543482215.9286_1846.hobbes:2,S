dunno if this is related, but I notice that on my machine, while shutting
down, lots of daemons take a long time to die. i.e. when the daemon stop
is run, they get a SIGTERM, but they take too long to die, and the script
has to SIGKILL them. It isn't too slow: a lot of them die in the 3 sec
interval before the KILL, but on 2.1.132, they used to die in the 0.1 sec
that the script waited after sending the SIGTERM. Net result is that it takes
a huge amount of time to shutdown.
Sys is redhat 5.2 with 2.2.0pre9.
