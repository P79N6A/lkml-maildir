HI all...
Tell me if this is correct. GCC-3.2 spits a wrning like this when
building -jam, I did not noticed before:
ialloc.c: In function `ext3_new_inode':
ialloc.c:546: warning: comparison between pointer and integer
ialloc.c:682: warning: label `out' defined but not used
ialloc.c:520: warning: `gdp' might be used uninitialized in this function
Line is question is:
    if (gdp == -1)
        goto fail;
It comes from the orlov-allocator for ext3.
Looking at the structure of ext3_new_inode:
struct inode * ext3_new_inode (handle_t *handle, struct inode * dir, int mode)
{
    ...
    struct ext3_group_desc * gdp;
        
repeat:
    ...
    if (gdp == -1)
        goto fail;
    ...
    gdp = ext3_get_group_desc (sb, group, &bh2);
    ...                    
Thigs to note:
- gdp is used without previous initialization.
- gdp is a pointer and is compared with -1
Should not the structure be:
    gdp = ext3_get_group_desc (sb, group, &bh2);
    if (!gdp)
        goto fail;
Can anybody check 2.5 for this also ?
???
TIA
