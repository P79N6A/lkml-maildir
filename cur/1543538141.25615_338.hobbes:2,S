I'm trying to whittle "make more robust" into something more concrete. 
Currently there is a namespace collision with 'buf' in printk.c (your
patch #4), but I just don't see anything more than that.  Since 'buf' is
protected by console_lock currently, things seem to be otherwise ok. 
Recursive printk?  Lost messages?  Your patch #4 seems like just a bunch
of extra code for rare if not impossible cases.
Please do correct me if I'm wrong!
