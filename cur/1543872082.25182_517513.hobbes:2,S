This may be a little off topic but I know there's
people here that can give me a quick answer.
I'm running Fedora Core 6 and I have two blocks of IP
addresses on eth0.
69.50.231.0/28
69.50.231.128/26
Do I need to set some kind of static route so that IPs
in one set can talk to the other? If so - how do I do
that?
Thanks in advance.
