The latest existing formal spec is probably POSIX 2001 (look under "pax").  
An older POSIX version would have it under "cpio". You'll probably also  
find it there in Unix98 a.k.a. SuSv2. (POSIX 2001 (the Austin revision)  
supersedes all of those.)
It's a bit long to post here - probably exceeds fair use.
