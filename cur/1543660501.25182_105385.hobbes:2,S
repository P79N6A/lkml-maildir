I suspect Linux's implementation of asynch I/O isn't able to handle sockets yet.
Thus the choice is between nonblocking I/O and blocking I/O.
Nonblocking I/O is totally the way to go if you have full control over your
source code and want the maximal performance in userspace.  The best way
to get good performance with nonblocking I/O in Linux is to use the sys_epoll
system call; it's part of the 2.5 kernel, but a backport to 2.4 is available.
