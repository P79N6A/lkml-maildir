Maybe this is a stupid question but in terms of inline patches what exactly
would be ideal behavior from a mail client for LKML patch submitters? What
line lengths are expected to be maintained, preferred encodings, tabs vs.
spaces, etc? I have noticed that some patch submitters append an EOF after
the patch, while others do not. Would the ability to pull the patch from
the message body (assuming there was an agreed upon patch termination
string) as a separate file/download be useful? Though my client is web
based it is quite speedy and can handle large folders as well as many
desktop clients IMHO. I would gladly implement specific features to make
patch submission for LKML compliant.
