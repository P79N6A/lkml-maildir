Agreed. If sysadmins get trapped by the upgrade, the fix for an
hypotethical DoS is a 100%-certain DoS by itself. The general sense
that "if it's not broken, don't fix it" applies here as well. The
server's sysadmin should not be bothered by a security upgrade (anyway,
after a few minutes of havoc in prod, he will revert to previous version
without trying to understand any further). But the campus sysadmin having
trouble with local users already spends a lot of time tweaking limits.
Now we offer them a new limit they can tune, they'll happily use it.
Anyway, even at 128 they'll probably lower it down a lot. So basically
we're with a medium value which does not fit any usage.
