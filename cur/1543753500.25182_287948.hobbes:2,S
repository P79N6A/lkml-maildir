Right, that's a point I forgot to talk about.

Yes, the address space layout randomization (ASLR) as PaX calls it,
makes really difficult to get done the so-called ret2libc attacks, but
anyway it could be interesting to write some tests trying to achieve it,
most for fun than an useful thing, as (unexpected) results might be as
randomized as the address space can be ;D
PIE is, hopefully, also being introduced in Debian-based systems by the
Hardened Debian project.
Gentoo has the Hardened Gentoo official sub project, which is doing (and
has did) a great work around this stuff, among the deployment of other
security technologies.
Cheers and thanks for the comments,
