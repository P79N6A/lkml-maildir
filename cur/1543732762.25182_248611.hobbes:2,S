udef is a one big mistake, having need for userspace tool to use FS is
at least silly.
I can understeand need for some things in kernel to have userspace
daemon. But FS is out of question the least one.
I am supprised noone wanted to maintain devfs. Maybe because people
didn't want to go to devfs only. But still to have classic /dev. It's
also silly, because person writing driver needs to choose between, or
implement all. That's more than bad. Once I have loads of time, and no
work in KDE, I can take over devfs happily :-)
