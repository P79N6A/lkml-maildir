All the potential solutions we're discussing hit that problem so I don't
see it matters much which one we choose ;-)

There are some things that may well help here: one is vsyscall gettimeofday,
which will fix up the worst of the issues (the 30% figure you mentioned
to me in Ottowa), the other is NAPI, which would help with the network
stuff.
Bill had a patch to allocate mmaps, etc down from the top of memory and
thus elimininate TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE, and shift the stack back into the
empty hole from 0-128MB of memory where it belongs (according to the spec).
Getting rid of those two problems gives us back a little more userspace 
as well. 
Unfortunately it does seem to break some userspace apps making stupid 
assumptions, but if we have a neat way to mark the binaries (Andi was
talking about personalities or something), we could at least get the
big mem hogs to do that (databases, java, etc).
I have a copy of Bill's patch in my tree if you want to take a look:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mbligh/patches/2.6.3/2.6.3-mjb1/410-topdown
That might make your 2.5/1.5 proposal more feasible with less loss of
userspace.
