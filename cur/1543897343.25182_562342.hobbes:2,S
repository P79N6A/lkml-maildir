Hmm, not that I have a strong opinion one way or the other, but I
don't know that they would encourage bad code. They are not going to
reduce latency under a locked section, but will improve determinism
in the contended case.
They should also improve performance in heavily contended case due to
the nature of how they spin, but I know that's not something you want
to hear about. And theoretically there should be no reason why xadd is
any slower than dec and look at the status flags, should there? I never
implementedit in optimised assembly to test though...
Some hardware seems to have no idea of fair cacheline scheduling, and
especially when there are more than 2 CPUs contending for the
cacheline, there can be large starvations.
And actually some times we have code that really wants to drop the
lock and queue behind other contenders. Most of the lockbreak stuff
for example.
Suppose we could have a completely fair spinlock primitive that has
*virtually* no downsides over the unfair version, you'd take the fair
one, right?
Not that I'm saying they'd ever be a good solution to bad code, but I
do think fairness is better than none, all else being equal.

Anyway, I think the important point is that they can remain within 4
bytes, which is obviously the most important boundary (they could be
2 bytes on i386).
