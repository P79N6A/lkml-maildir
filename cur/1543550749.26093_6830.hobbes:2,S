Sorry, but this still doesn't work. I tested -F5 and -F8 and they both
hang at "Calibrating delay loop". Same problem as before: the local APIC's
LVT0 and LVT1 entries hadn't yet been reprogrammed to ExtINT and NMI,
respectively, so no interrupts could be delivered to the CPU core.
I did the following to make -F8 work on my UP Pentium III machine:
* Moved the low-level APIC enabling code out of APIC_init_uniprocessor
  to a separate function APIC_enable_uniprocessor (just a wrapper
  around setup_local_APIC).
* In init_apic_mappings() I call APIC_enable_uniprocessor immediately
  after it has been mapped; without this call, the kernel won't get any
  interrupts.
* Moved setup_apic_nmi_watchdog from setup_local_APIC to
  APIC_init_uniprocessor; this is because setup_apic_nmi_watchdog needs
  cpu_khz, but cpu_khz hasn't been computed yet when my patch calls
  setup_local_APIC. I don't know how this will affect SMP systems.
  (side note: why not just make setup_apic_nmi_watchdog an __initcall?)
