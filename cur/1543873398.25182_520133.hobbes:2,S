The problem is subtle, but I think the solution is actually fairly simple.

No, it can't schedule more cpu time than exists.  But it should account
for the time the processes actually had available to them, rather than
assuming they got the full power of the cpu.

That's one workaround, but sometimes its desirable to keep even
cpu-bound processes at a lower cpu performance level for power-saving
reasons.  Modern CPUs are designed to switch performance states very
quickly, so its conceivable you could change performance every context
switch, though no governor currently uses that fine granularity.

I suppose, but it seems to me that they're pretty much the same thing.

My sympathies; neck problems are bad news.
