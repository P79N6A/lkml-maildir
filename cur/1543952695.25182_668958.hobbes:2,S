Better, I guess.
There's a design problem in the LED interface, though.  If callers really
do want to be able to call led_classdev.brightness_set() from atomic
contexts then we should either
a) make that function atomic (as you've done).  But that's inefficient.
b) pass in a mode flag to tell the callee whether it is allowed to
   sleep.  Ugly, but there's lots of precedent: GFP_ATOMIC-vs-GFP_KERNEL.
c) create a separate led_classdev.brightness_set_atomic() which callers
   should use when they're in atomic contexts.
Option c) would be best from a cleanness and efficiency POV.
