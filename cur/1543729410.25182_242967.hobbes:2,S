Start time indeed is a constant for each process, and doesn't drift. 
The problem trather is that a (slightly) wrong start time is assigned
to newly created processes.

Yep.

Where's the problem with the last two of them?
I think I can do them if you fix the first three, so that I can see which
time source is going to replace jiffies here.
