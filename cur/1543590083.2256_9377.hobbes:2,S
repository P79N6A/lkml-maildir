Hrmm...  I agree this is a hard problem.  I know people smarter than I have
been thinking about this type of problem at Compaq.  While I haven't talked to
them directly, my only guess would be that we'd have to hand-rewrite some page
tables after copying the page contents to a new area.  It's late Saturday and
I really haven't thought this through fully, so I'm not even sure that would
work, but it's something like how we support replicated text segments on our
GS series...don't know why it wouldn't work here.  *shrug*

It's the IBM technology that works around bad memory by detecting single-bit
errors and removing the chip that caused it from use.  I'd think of this as a
big hammer version of that in software.  Besides, eventually you'll want to
replace the DIMM that has the bad chip, and what better way then while the
system is still running (as long as it's stable, of course ;)  I'm just
thinking out loud, so someone can correct me if I'm being loopy...
