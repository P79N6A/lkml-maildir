I presume you mean something like (in an arch-specific file somewhere):
void *dma_alloc_consistent (struct device *dev, size_t size,
                            dma_addr_t *dma_handle,
        		    enum dma_conformance_level level)
{
    if (dev->SOME_FIELD == SOME_CONSTANT)
        return my_wierd_ass_pci_alloc_consistent ((struct pci_dev *)dev, ...);
    else
        return 0; /* or kmalloc(...); */
}
?
I did a bit of grovelling, but I'm still not quite sure what test I
can do (i.e., what SOME_FIELD and SOME_CONSTANT should be, if it's
really that simple).
Ah well, as long as it's possible I guess I'll figure it out when the
source hits the fan...
