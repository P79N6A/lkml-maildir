I think the ISDN stuff should be retrofitted to 2.2.something-or-other, 
and the big-device-number code really should be in 2.3.early so that
people can start fixing all those applications which, even though they're
compilable with glibc these days, still use those shorts someplace.
(I don't have a TB disk either -- I just wish I had one. ;-)
