With 2.6.24-rc5, a b43 user reports a problem at bootup. The b43 module, which should be loaded by
the ssb module, fails with the following type of message:
ssb: Sonics Silicon Backplane found on PCI device 0000:0c:00.0
b43: disagrees about version of symbol ssb_device_is_enabled
b43: Unknown symbol ssb_device_is_enabled
b43: disagrees about version of symbol ssb_pcicore_dev_irqvecs_enable
b43: Unknown symbol ssb_pcicore_dev_irqvecs_enable
b43: disagrees about version of symbol ssb_bus_may_powerdown
b43: Unknown symbol ssb_bus_may_powerdown
< and more similar lines....>
If the user issues the commands
rmmod ssb; modprobe b43
then the modules are loaded correctly and the wireless device works.
What could be causing such a problem?
