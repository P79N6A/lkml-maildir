Subject: [2.6.2-rc2] R31 hangs after booting oops

Hello,
my Thinkpad R31 stops during the boot-process when I give 'acpi=off' as boot 
option, but on using acpi it boots fine (so when I'm not giving this option).
Unfortunality it has no serial port to capture this oops -- any suggestions 
how to capture it via parallel port or via usb-to-serial cable?
I manually write down some maybe helpfull messages, please tell me, if you 
need more or have an idea how to get a full automatic trace.
