as with 2.2.0-final
the ati64 support can not be switched from xconfig, but can be swithced
from menuconfig.
It results  in graphics screwup (that was not the case with 2.2.0-pre7)
in very early stage of kernel loading, right after  entering kernel name
at boot prompt.
lilo.conf : vga=4
Then I bilndly typing start up x (runlevel 3 here) and that is ok.
Switching back to text console just shows screwed up graphics.
