Subject: [PATCH 1/2] IPMI and acpi=off|ht : acpi-get-firmware-failure.patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch check that rsdt_info->pointer is not NULL before trying to
unmap ACPI tables, which can happen if acpi_tb_get_rsdt_address() failed.
In my case, with ipmi_si_intf module and acpi=ht|off parameter, the call
failed because acpi_gbl_table_flags is not initialised, so the
address.pointer_type is not setup correctly, leading to message like:
May 16 11:18:29 localhost kernel:     ACPI-0166: *** Error: Invalid address flags 8
and rsdt_info->pointer equal to NULL leading to the Oops.
