No this is not set. Must this be set? Actually I want that one can stop the
watchdog gracefully. And this is done by writting a 'V' to /dev/watchdog,
correct? 
I noticed that CONFIG_WATCHDOG is also not set since CONFIG_IPMI_WATCHDOG
is set under IPMI. Must this be set? Is the IPMI watchdog different to
all the other watchdogs or why is it listed seperatly?
