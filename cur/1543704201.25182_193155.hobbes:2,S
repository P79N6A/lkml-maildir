Yes, I realize this patch isn't quite sane yet, that's why it's still in
the -mm tree :)

I don't care about which driver is used by the raw device, I care about
which block device the raw device is "bound" to.  That happens at
RAW_SETBIND time, right?  We do this in the line:
	rawdev->binding = bdget(dev);
Hm, wait, are you saying that at open() time we actually bind the char
device to the block device, and that struct block_device can change
between RAW_SETBIND and open() time due to hotpluggable devices?
Or am I missing something else here?
thanks,
greg k-h
