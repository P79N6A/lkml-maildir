We already have patches flying around for cache-bypass bulk memory
copies on P6.  By restricting the page cache to 1G when you have 4G of
free memory on a large web server, you are also slowing down the system
too much. :) And of course, in the long term the bounce buffers will
only affect devices which can't do the dma directly.

Nonsense!  You do only one copy, inside ll_rw_block.  You do it before
the IO for write, after the IO for read.  Nobody else has to know.  We
already implement bounce buffers underneath the ll_rw_block interface
for some ISA devices and it works just fine.
