The cute Tux penguin comes out of its cave each time I boot Linux
kernels 2.5.x+ since I started trying (and using) them. However, our
pretty friend comes sorrounded by a white band its own height, and all
the way to the right of the screen.
This is a box with a nVIDIA GeForce 2 MX based card:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV11DDR [GeForce2 MX 100 DDR/200 DDR] (rev b2)
And the kernel (now 2.6.0-test2-mm2) is compiled with:
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_FB_RIVA=y
And the kernel is booted without passing it any vga= modes.
