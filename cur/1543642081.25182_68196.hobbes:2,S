the fact that he is saying that this needs to run normal filesystems tells
us that.
if you need a filesystem to max out transfer rate and don't want to have
it cache things that is a VERY specialized thing and not something that
will match what NTFS/XFS/JFS/ReiserFS/ext2 etc are going to be used for.
either he has a very specialized need (in which case a specialized
filesystem is probably the best bet anyway) or he is trying to support
normal uses (in which case caching is important)
however the point is that the read-modify-write cycle is a form of cache,
it is only safe if you aquire a lock at the beginning of it and release it
at the end. A standard filesystem won't do this, this is what makes a DFS.
