I did some testing and the new code does not emit warnings which were
not emitted before. But previously you had to use less typical
configurations to see them like HOTPLUG_CPU=y, HOTPLUG=n, gcc 3.3

It is the misinformation being spread that irritates me.
Thousand of hours, no real bugs found etc.
Anyway - that is all forgot tomorrow when we get the warning level down
to zero.

The good thing about getting it upstream is the additional attention.
If we do not get it down to acceptable levels I have no problems
turning off the section mismatch in minline but keep it enabled
in -mm.
