OOPS. Sorry.
I didn't notice the following paragraph in nvram.c as I read it:
 * The data are supplied as a (seekable) character device, /dev/nvram. The
 * size of this file is 50, the number of freely available bytes in the memory
 * (i.e., not used by the RTC itself).
So yes, please ignore the 50 vs 64 question.
