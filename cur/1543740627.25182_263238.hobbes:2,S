Also consider the Fujitsu Coral parts for embedded use:
http://www.fme.gsdc.de/gsdc.htm?macrofam/mb86295.htm
They have a large manual, though I can't vouch for completeness. They
have 3D and alpha blending. They don't have legacy VGA registers, and
they don't have a VGA BIOS. In an embedded system, that's a bonus.
This is the competition facing a new open source graphics chip in the
embedded segment.
