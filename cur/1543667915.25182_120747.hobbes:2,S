Hi all,
I am trying to bring up a hard drive formated to 8KB page size using ext2. It seems that i may need to recompile the kernel, as default PAGE_SIZE is 4KB. I have 2 questions:
1) What is the procedure to build a kernel that can support hard drives formatted to 8KB ext2?
2) What is the procedure to format a hard drive to 8KB ext2?
Thank you so much,
Jordi
