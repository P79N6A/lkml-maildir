I actually never had problems with the video working, it always did
work. Given the information I have at hand, though, the video card
I'm using is apparently conflicting with the secondary IDE.

Well I don't know whether this is what is causing the weirdness that's
creating the ck804 problems, but I can confirm that I do get those exact
same "OUT OF SPEC" messages when running dmidecode.
Here's what google turns up:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=114778
Looking at the dmidecode sources, it seems that it reports "OUT OF SPEC"
for anything it doesn't recognize. There's not much more about it in the
sources or the docs, from what I can see that is.
