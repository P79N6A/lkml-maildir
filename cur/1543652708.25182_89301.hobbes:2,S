	Hi;
	I have been playing with this. The userspace tools are
not backwards compatible. (2.4 tools didnt seem compatible
with 2.2 tools either-- Ive got 3 sets of them laying around)
	Currently, LVM2 under 2.5 repeatedly will hit a BUG() and
oops for me. I also managed to destroy a test striped lv.
I wouldnt trust any important data to it yet.
	(Jens Axboe has expressed a willingness to help with
the problem. Just a matter of time...)
	You need a > 2.5.47 kernel (eg. a recent bk snapshot,
or eg. 2.5.47-ac2 or 2.5.45-mcp2) to even compile with
DM support if you want to play with this.
