Not really.  The rtc driver can only have a single user regardless of weather or
not it has an mmap interface.  using mmap just provides another mothod for
accessing the rtc.

Sure, an mmaped jiffy counter would certainly be usefull.  I think the only
thing left to be determined in this thread is if adding mmap to the rtc driver
has any merit regardless of any potential users (iow, would current users of
/dev/rtc find it helpful to have the rtc driver provide an mmap interface.)
