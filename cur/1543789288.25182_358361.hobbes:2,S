I looked into this more and I did have a good reason for putting them in
different headers. The __GFP_* flags have to be defined with the other GFP
flags, it just does not make sense otherwise. The RCLM_* flags must be
with the definition of struct zone * because there determine the number of
free lists that exist in the zone. There is no obvious way to have the
RCLM_* and __GFP_* flags in the same place unless mmzone.h includes gfp.h
which I seriously doubt we want.
The value of RCLM_SHIFT depends on both __GFP_* and RCLM_* so it needs to
be defined in a place that can see both gfp.h and mmzone.h . As
page_alloc.c is the only user of RCLM_SHIFT, it made sense to define it
there.
Is there a clearer way of doing this?
