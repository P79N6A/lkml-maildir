Hmm.  read-with-PAGE_COPY may not be any faster than read as you still
read all of the data into memory, so you have almost the same latency.
mmap might work better because of better overlapping of I/O and cpu
processing.
Also read-with-PAGE_COPY has some really interesting implications for the
page out routines.  Because anytime you start the page out you have to
copy the page.  Not exactly when you want to increase the memory presure.
And not at all suitable for shared libraries.
