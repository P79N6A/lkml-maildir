KDB has a similar problem, it needs struct pt_regs as a starting point
for backtraces and that is not always available.  I get around the lack
of a pt_regs by using KDB_ENTER() which generates a software interrupt.
We could define a software interrupt for SYSRQ_ENTER(key).  This would
remove all the overhead of saving and tracking pt_regs from the fast
paths.  The downside is that it needs a software interrupt to be
defined for every arch :(.
