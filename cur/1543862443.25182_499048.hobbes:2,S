Hi,
There are ITE 8212-based controllers installed in some of my
computers. I had always skipped the build-in RAID things and used them
as plain controllers.
1. Beginning with 2.6.18 there was some trouble, basically slowed data
transfer, sometimes even a totally stalled system (I cannot reproduce
the latter though).
Diffing dmesg of 2.6.17.x and 2.6.18.x (same for 2.6.19):

OK, there was "BUG" up to and including 2.6.17 but the disk(s) worked
without any problem. 
Not surprisingly the disk throughput was affected by that. Comparing
"hdparm -tT /dev/hde":
2.6.17
/dev/hde:
 Timing cached reads:    88 MB in  2.01 seconds =  43.72 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   26 MB in  3.21 seconds =   8.10 MB/sec
2.6.18
/dev/hde:
 Timing cached reads:    90 MB in  2.04 seconds =  44.01 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   16 MB in  3.14 seconds =   5.10 MB/sec
2. Trying to understand what has happened I found the main difference
is not in the driver but in ide-dma.c:

        return;
 bug_dma_off:
and reverting that change returns the old transfer rates. But that is
probably not a good idea.
3. To increase confusion: I had learned the ite8212 chip is close to
the cmd/sil680, and patching siimage.c had been a solution to get
support for 8212 before it showed up in the kernel.
So I tried this again:

and disabled CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IT821X - and now the disk is even faster
than before:
/dev/hde:
 Timing cached reads:    88 MB in  2.01 seconds =  43.71 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   34 MB in  3.02 seconds =  11.25 MB/sec
So it seems the problem is it82xx.c at least for my controllers.
4. Now there is 2.6.19 and the new ata driver model. So I tried that
one, too:
Booting with

5. OK, there's a workaround but I'd really like to avoid such cludges.
Is there anything I could try next?

Some more things:
- This is not related to the hard disk. I've also tested others, same
  results.
- According to the bios the controller set the mode to UDMA-2 ("U2").
  Faster disks are recognized accordingling e.g. "U5" but
  using the patched siimage hdparm -i tells that are in udma2 only.
- The it8212_noraid option didn't help either. There is only a single
  disk attached.
- The mainboard is a rather old ALI15X3, CPU ist AMDK6 at 366 MHz.
  Chances are that different boards do not show such effects.
- The controller's firmware is quite old (1.4.1.6) but update failed.
  There are two jumpers but they are not documented.
