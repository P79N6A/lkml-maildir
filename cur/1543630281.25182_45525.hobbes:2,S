Have you tried SysRQ+showTasks? That dumps the kernel stack. You can 
convert the numbers to names with ksymoops, or often klogd will convert 
them and the result is in /var/log/messages.
What exactly hangs?
Could you run
	strace ls /proc/1234
	strace cat /proc/1234/maps
	strace ls /proc/1234/fd -l
Which syscall hangs?
SMP or UP?
