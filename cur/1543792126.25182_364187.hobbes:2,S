Yeah, your right, that should be 0x1fe0000. Looks like a yank bug.

Yes indeed, this is a mis-use of CONFIG_EMBEDDED.
I would be happy to see another config option for another
more generic bus type. There is a whole bunch of peripherals
that are attached to directly (or at least to some other
fixed) bus type - not just network adapters.
I can see that some will argue that these are ISA bus
peripherals, therefore CONFIG_ISA should be enabled.
Maybe. But in this type of deeply embedded hardware it is
not hooked up to an ISA bus in the normal sense. Typically
there is some dedicated logic to massage the signals just
enough for the periperal device to work.

This is a bug workaround for some versions of gcc (arm targeted) that
produced huge stack consumption on some codes. I recall some crypto
functions where the problem. I could dig around and find out more
about the extac versions, etc, if interrested...
This one crept in here, and doesn't belong here at all.
Thanks
