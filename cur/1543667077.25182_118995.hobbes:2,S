Yup, but (besides the tar tpyo you corrected later) this still isn't
safe.
1) gpg --verify won't be able to complete until it's seen all the unpacked
   tar file.
2) During that time tar -xf - will be unpacking and writing.
3) If the signature is bad, too late you've already unpacked it:
   -At best you need to blow away what you just unpacked.
   -Worse, it may have just (over)written real files in pwd other than
     the ones you think it should have.
   -Worst, if the tarfile is maliciously crafted to exploit tar (..'ing
     archive, symlink-following archive, or bad data which overflows
     tar), who-knows-what damage is already done.  This might sound
     far-fetched, except that it already happens.
...But it sounds like the whole discussion is dead anyway.  It would be
at least slightly less off-topic on security-audit, perhaps we should
move it there (

).  Or to alt.tinfoil.hat.
