AFAICT you can't link GPL to non-GPL code and ship the product without heading 
deep into grey area territory. Both the GPL and LGPL has specific wording for 
certain cases (such as allowing LGPL (possibly GPL too?) to link to closed 
source system libraries and the reverse as well), but its really icky to link 
GPL to closed source code in any form.

But doesn't that force the GPL code to rely on closed source code, and not 
function properly without it? I remember a part in the GPL about not allowing 
that, but I can't seem to find it atm.

Now thats pretty useful information. I think everyone should bookmark those 
and file those away for later, I sure am. Thanks for finding those.
