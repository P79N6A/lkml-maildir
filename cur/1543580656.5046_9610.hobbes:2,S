I was just giving an example of how kiobufs might need splitting up more often
than you think, crossing a stripe boundary is one obvious case. Yes you do
want to keep the pages which are contiguous on disk together, but you will
often get requests which cover multiple stripes, otherwise you don't really
get much out of stripes and may as well just concatenate drives.
Ideally the file is striped across the various disks in the volume, and one
large write (direct or from the cache) gets scattered across the disks. All
the I/O's run in parallel (and on different controllers if you have the 
budget).
