My expectation is that this is a shell interface for debugging,
not an API for programs.  ala /proc/interrupts.
if we have 40 individual files, each with a number in it,
it is less convenient to cat the file and paste the results
into an email or bug report and have the receiver easily
see what what count goes with what file -- or is there
a version of cat that prints the file name before
the contents of each file?
I've seen 
more * | cat
but one has to wonder why an interface would be built
to make something so simple not be simple.

Good question.  What's to ensure we don't overflow it
when I print any other random string?
Who allocates it and how big is it?

If sysfs can't handle it, I suppose I could instead
print the needed information to the console....

you're right, there is rumour of a future machine
with more than 32 GPEs...

ok.
