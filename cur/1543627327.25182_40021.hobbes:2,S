The physical register on the side of the device may very well be
only 16 bit's wide. Most propably it's simple implementation dependant.
I saw many 68000 derivatives on IDE controllers but those days there
are many 32 bit controllers there as well.
But please note that the ata host-chip xor the CPU (think 386sx)
is multiplexing the access to it. Otherwise it wouldn't be possible to do 32 bit
transfers over a cable with only 16 data lines at all.
Apparently you don't even understand the physical transport layer,
which explains the presence of the bug in question.
