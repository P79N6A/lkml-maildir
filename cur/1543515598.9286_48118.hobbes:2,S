That's a problem I would like to address later, since it's a perfomance
only problem, where the sti() stuff is also a portability problem.
Anyway, I'm preparing some stuff to address this, but that's the more
complex change, but I hope to get a better overall perfomance out of
this, as there are more perfomance problems with some linux interrupt
handler (especially almost all block devices).
bye, Roman
