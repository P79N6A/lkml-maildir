LTT 0.9.5pre1 is out.
As the name says, this is a development version and should be
treated as such. Only one kernel is supported with 0.9.5pre1,
linux 2.4.0-test10.
What it includes:
-Cross-platform reading capability submitted by Andy Lowe
-Visualizer enhancements submitted by Rocky Craig
-Patch fixes by Peng Dai and Bob Montgomery
-Many bug fixes seen using the "-Wall" flag to build the user tools
The trace format has changed again to support cross-platform
reading capabilities.
0.9.5pre1 has no support for RTAI. pre2 will include the cross-
platform capabilities for RTAI.
Here's what should be in pre2:
-Support for 2.2.18/2.4.2
-Support for the latest RTAI, including cross-platform capabilities
-Benchmark fixes from Rocky Craig
-SH support by Greg Banks
Check the project's web-site for details on 0.9.5pre1:
