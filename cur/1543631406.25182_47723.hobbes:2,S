Hi all,
	the latest ALSA -> kernel patch is available for tests at
ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/kernel-patches/alsa-2002-05-23-1-linux-2.5.17-cs1.582.patch.gz
	I'd like to ask interested people to test this patch and report
especially compilation problems, because there are some fixes in code
dependency for OSS emulation layer. Also Hammerfall DSP code was recently
added.
					Thank you,
						Jaroslav
Note: cs1.582 really means that patch was made against ChangeSet 1.582.
