Think about what happens in the meantime.  Most distros install maintenance
scripts which run late at night (usually at midnight and/or 4am), which
perform heavy disk activity as they update databases and scan for
file-permissions security holes.  Heavy disk activity usually means an
increase in buffer utilisation.  Since most files are only "touched" once,
the cache is shrunk as it aren't being used very much.
