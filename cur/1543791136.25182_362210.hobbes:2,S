Duh, I just looked again.  I knew we had kmap, I had thought kmap_atomic
was special enough that it wasn't always there.  I'm wrong.

The set of memory controllers where software scrubbing is interesting
and the set of memory controllers that need larger than page sized scrubs
intersect quite strongly.  Although I don't think any of those
memory controllers ever migrated over from the old ecc.c code base.
We should at least have a BUG_ON((offset+size) > PAGE_SIZE) so we
don't forget to fix it.
