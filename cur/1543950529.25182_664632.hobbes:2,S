I didn't see any problem offhand with the other patches 0 to 3 in this
set, but this patch 4/4 surprises me.
Perhaps I'm out of phase with what's customary in the kernel, but I
prefer directly including whatever headers I explicitly need.
Depending on some other header to drag in something you have explicit
need of anyway makes things more fragile.
