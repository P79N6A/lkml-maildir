Subject: [2.6 patch] kconfig: abort configuration with recursive dependencies
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

A recursive kconfig dependency is a bug that has to be fixed, and that 
might currently not be noted until booting the built kernel.
Currently, the warning that a recursive dependency was detected scrolls 
away during "make oldconfig", and often people don't notice until they 
booted the kernel and note something like "Why is there no IPV6 support?".
This patch therefore lets the configuration fail if kconfig found a 
recursive dependency.
