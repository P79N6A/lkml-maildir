I doubt it.
All of the IDE drives I have used spin up when power is applied.  Most of
the scsi (except for some really old ones) have a jumper that tells the
drive to wait until it receives a message from the scsi controller to spin up.
I'd imagine that IDE would need some protocol spec changes before this could
be supported (at least a "spin the drive up" message...).
