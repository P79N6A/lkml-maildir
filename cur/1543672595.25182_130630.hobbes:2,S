The problem was that the devices disappeared. I did not realize that you 
did a typo and they were created at another place, though.
So I rewrote the code for both 2.4 and 2.5 and it worked again.

Ok, I understand.
I promise that I don't touch the devfs related code anymore. But, how do 
we proceed in general?
Will the other patches be applied and who does that for which tree?
Shall I resend the patches where you had objections?
CU
Michael.
