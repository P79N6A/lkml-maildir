And how do you propose to do that?
For instance, in some other operating systems having the top bit flip
in a pointer will cause silent use of incorrect data.  On Linux, this
will cause a signal 11.  Which do you prefer, bad results or an error
message?
Can you suggest a specific way in which Linux can react correctly to
e.g. flipped bits in RAM or cache which cannot be detected at the hardware
level?  Or maybe tell me how Linux can react correctly when an overclocked
CPU starts producing incorrect results for right shifts once every few
thousand instructions?
There exists hardware specifically intended to be able to diagnose and
contain its own failures, but the number of such features on a common
home PC is probably a big fat zero.

And that's what you have to do --- fix the problem.  In a few situations,
you might be able to isolate and exclude the section of RAM which is
bad (in fact, there are patches for this and tools to diagnose the
problem), but what do you want Linux to do about a processor which cannot
reliably execute instructions?

I've got a better idea:  Overclockers can go to hell, and their bug reports
to the trash, until they "reform" like you and I have.
