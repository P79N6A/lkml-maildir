Subject: TLD.rmk.(none) junk in BitKeeper logs where BK_HOST belongs?

Hello,
whose broken script or BitKeeper installation causes all these annoying
de.rmk.(none), au.rmk.(none) and all that to be logged instead of the
real BK_HOST?
The pattern seems to be the original TLD with 2nd level and below of the
domain stripped, plus .rmk.(none) appended.
I don't care to know who it is but would the offending system please be
updated or fixed?
Thanks in advance. Sample, 20 random incidents, one with full log:

  [SERIAL] Fix supprot for AFAVLAB 8port boards in 2.6.x
  I didn't yet use one of my AFAVLAB boards with 2.6.x until now.  The
  upper 4 ports are not detected at all.  I suppose the bug was
  introduced while porting the driver from 2.4.x.
  Please consider applying the following patch.  It also adds support
  for a new 8 port board called P030.
