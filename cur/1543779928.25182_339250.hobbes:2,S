The application can already get it. But it's an ugly feature
that I only used for debugging and I was actually considering
to remove it.
Doing it for external users is a completely different thing though.
I still think those have business in messing with other people's
virtual addresses. In addition I expect it will cause problems
longer term
(did you ever look why mmap on /proc/*/mem is not allowed - it used
to be long ago, but it was impossible to make it work race free and
before that was always a gapping security hole)

Ok. I think for those the swapoff per process is the right because
simplest and easiest solution. No complex patch sets needed,
just some changes to an existing code path.
If they cannot afford enough disk space it might be possible
to do the page migration in swap cache like Hugh proposed.
