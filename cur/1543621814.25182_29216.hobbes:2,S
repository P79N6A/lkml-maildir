Hi,
I want to make, say, a machine 10.0.0.5 accept an IP packet with the
destination address of 10.0.0.2. I hope I can do this by changing a bit of
kernel networking code, where it's decided whether to accept an IP packet
as a local packet.. I could not locate the code.. could anybody tell me
where exactly the decision process take place?
Thanks a lot..
Sandeep
