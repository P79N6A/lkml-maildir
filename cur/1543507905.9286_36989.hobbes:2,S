     Hello,
       I need to write a keyboard driver in linux for a device which is
     between the PC and the keyboard. The driver has to handle specific
     commands meant for the device and pass the rest of the commands  to
     PC/keyboard. Does anyone have any idea how to go about doing this ?
     Please guide me about any documentation or books which may have this
     info. Any help welcome.
     Thanks in advance,
     Madhu
