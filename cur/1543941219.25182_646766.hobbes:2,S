Dear Andrew, all,
First of all, thank you for looking at the patch.
I do agree that if mm is NULL, system will call Oops anyway.
However, since it's oops, it does not stop the system, nor call kdump.
By calling BUG_ON(), it'll gives us chance of calling kdump at the first chance.
Since this is very rare to happen, I thought we should capture the incident
whenever possible. On other hand, because BUG_ON macro is very light,
I thought this will not harm any performance...
Forgive me in advance if I was wrong.
I still think checking mm with BUG_ON here is better than counting on Oops.
best regards,
