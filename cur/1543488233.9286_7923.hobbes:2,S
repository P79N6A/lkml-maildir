    I'm going to ask people in both camps here to _please_ be restrained
    when stepping into this flame^Wthread.
A flame is a kind of personal attack.  Those words of mine don't
attack or even criticize anyone.  They are a serious suggestion for
something that might be useful to do.
I hope that others who respond to my message will deal with
it constructively and not by flaming.
