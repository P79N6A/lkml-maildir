But its aa4, yet. ;-)
+EXTRAVERSION =-aa4
I will do today latency tests with this aa5, mc3 (with cfq and antic. 
scheduler) and the vanilla 2.6.5 kernel with latencytest-0.5.2 from
http://www.alsa-project.org/~iwai/alsa.html#LatencyTest
I love after the stress test browsing the graphical output with firefox. :-)
best regards,
Marcus
