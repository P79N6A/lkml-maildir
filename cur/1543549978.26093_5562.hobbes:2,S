Cool.  Once all the makefiles are 95% new-style (there will always be
oddball special case rules and dependencies), it shouldn't be too hard
to whip up a proggie which slurps all the Makefiles and spits out
one-big-Makefile.  With that, make gets a full picture of dependencies,
and parallel makes are much more sane.
