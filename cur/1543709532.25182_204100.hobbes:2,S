Hmm,
I don't think that this patch is necessary anymore. The latest driver
is contained in the sane-backends package. The backend is called
plustek_pp can can either be used completely from userspace or if
you want to as kernel-module (including all the patches for 2.6
kernel, except devfs support).
Ciao,
