Using also the via-rhine driver, 2.2.5 kernel, compile as module, same
problem as you, null bytes field in receive.
Rapidly looking at the source, it appeared that also there is a
tp->stats.tx_bytes += np->tx_ring[entry].desc_length & 0x7ff;
that update the sending stats, there is no equivalent for updating the
receiving bytes. This must not be a great job, I would maybe look at this
if I have 5 mins.
