I don't think we need it, Richard.  These writes to tty
devices from interrupt context are coming from line
disciplines - n_hdlc, ppp, r3964, etc.
Now, while it may be amusing to see if you can successfully
negotiate a PPP session by typing raw LCP, there really isn't,
I believe, a useful reason for attaching one of these ldiscs
to the console tty.
Interrupt-context writes to the *console*, as opposed to
the console *tty* work just fine, of course.  printk.
