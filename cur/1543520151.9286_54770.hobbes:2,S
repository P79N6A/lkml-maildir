ok, I understand what you meant by those strange values of errno. I.e. if
we try to set offset to something large but instead get 0 return we
(assuming we are a bad application) check for errno and get something
undefined.
Why "bad application"? Because a good application should think "ok, the
only error return according to manpage is -1 so if the return is not -1 I
will not check for errno even if the offset *looks* unexpected, i.e.
different from offset supplied, assuming SEEK_SET".
