Hi,

Well, you added it again in version 1.4 of your script. I removed it. 
But I reckon you should write it in bash, can safe you some lines :)

Et voilà, feel free to vomit:
ratz@laphish:~ > grep declare ver_linux.*
ver_linux.txt:      declare -i count
ratz@laphish:~ > loadkeys --junkoption
loadkeys: unrecognized option `--junkoption'
loadkeys version 1.04
Usage: loadkeys [option...] [mapfile...]
valid options are:
	-c --clearcompose clear kernel compose table
	-d --default	  load "defkeymap.map"
	-h --help	  display this help text
	-m --mktable      output a "defkeymap.c" to stdout
	-s --clearstrings clear kernel string table
	-u --unicode      implicit conversion to Unicode
	-v --verbose      report the changes

This is an information which you exactly don't have.

I was more making a joke on this one ...

Ok, hope /proc-fs doesn't change semantics.

I haven't seen one in a year or so but I assume you know how Linux 
kernel development history goes, so it's you call. I saw that you made 
some /proc check for ppp. This is very acceptable then.

Yes, agreed.

Oups, my bad, sorry.

Ok.

I saw. I attached a diff of your 1.4 to 1.5. Changelog:
o bumped version
o made echo ' ' -> echo. No need to pass strings
o safe/restore IFS. This is important in case you want to output lkm
   with spaces instead of newlines
o function truth() should check $1==0 and not $@ because if one calls
   truth() with more arguments, it fails.
o added yesno() function for tained mode
o added space to isdnlegitimate to read isdn legitimate
o rewrote modules output: I think it is cleaner now.
o removed remaining declare, printf is still there
o fixed ECN test already reported by another guy
o added tainted lkm checking

You're right so far.

Then use mount which is obviously more often deployed than fdformat.

I've a some dozens of patches lying around exactly because one of your 
above mentioned reasons. This, however, will never change. You tool 
needs to be intelligent enough to handle broken user space apps.

You seemed to have solved it in a way. One little invariant to fix 
remains though. Think what happens with your script, when one doesn't 
have proc-fs support ;)

 If version fields appear unusual you may have an old version. Compare to the
 current minimal requirements in linux/Documentation/Changes. Please double
 check lines that say "error getting version, try manually" for validity.
