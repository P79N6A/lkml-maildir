No, ioremap always maps non-cacheable, this has nothing to do with
the prefetching attribute

get_free_pages() returns you physical memory...

get_free_page allocates cacheable physical memory, nothing to do
with your PCI device... ioremap maps your device non-cacheable
into the kernel address space.

What are you trying to do exactly ?
Ben.
