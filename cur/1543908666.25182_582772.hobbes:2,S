I'm currently toying with splice. The test program I have sends a MPEG2 
transport stream from a dvb card and sends it to N clients via http.
Since the dvb frontend driver doesn't support splice 
(linux/drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dmxdev.c I guess, anyone interested in 
adding splice support to it?) I had to do a normal read() to a 
user-space buffer and then write that to a pipe.
Once the data is in the pipe, my idea was to tee() from the pipe to each 
client socket using nonblocking ops, and then consume the data by 
splicing it to /dev/null.
The problem is that tee() doesn't support sockets. Is this a limitation 
that would be easy to fix?
Otherwise I guess I'd have to add a second pipe, then (in a loop)
tee() from the first to the second pipe and then splice from the 
second pipe to a socket. Doesn't sound very elegant and would need quite 
a lot of extra syscalls.
