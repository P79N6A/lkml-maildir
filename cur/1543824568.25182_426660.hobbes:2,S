Is the bug recreatable every single time when you try to fsck?
Have you tried recreating the issue without EHCI?  That should help us
at least narrow it down to the specific USB controller.  
It seems to me like something is causing trouble down somewhere in the
MM subsystem - its almost like something is walking over sensitive parts
of memory - but be it stack or heap, I can't tell.
