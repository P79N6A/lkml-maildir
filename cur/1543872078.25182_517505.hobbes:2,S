I lose at using git.  Sorry.  I'll be more careful to check that all of
my changes on the current branch are committed before I run my git diff.
Or maybe someone will convince me to use git in an all new better way.
I created a branch that has your tree and then created a new branch off
of that for my changes.  I checked out my branch made my patch and
commited.  I then tried to compile failed and fixed it up.  I then
compiled, booted, and tested.  When I thought it was working I did a
git diff miller..my-branch-with-pfkey_spdget
which didn't have my fix up because i didn't commit it to my local
branch.  Is there a better way to get a diff between my miller tree and
'everything in the branch I have checked out even if it is not
committed'?
Sorry, even if there are no ideas I'll be more careful.
