That would prevent people wanting to run real virtualised 8086 stuff
that does use the AC trap, and other vm86 extensions to the basic real
mode stuff.
If you want an accurate real mode emulation you are stuck with Bochs,
not down to the kernel but down to the fact vm86 is a mode for running
8086 applications under a 32bit system, not a mode for emulation of real
mode.
