you are completely missing the point.
the fact that the kernel group is going to have to maintain the code over 
the long run means that it must be acceptable to them before it gets 
added.
so saying that it's supported (for now) by namesys doesn't matter. if it's 
not something that is in a state that can be maintained over the long 
term by the kernel group then it can't be accepted, exactly BECOUSE nobody 
expects an outside orginization to maintain the code forever.
Namesys is allowed to maintain the code themselves outside the kernel for 
as long as they want to (and even fork the kernel if they need to make 
changes to it that aren't acceptable to the mainline). Namesys is asking 
the core kernel team to accept their code into the mainline so that it 
will be maintained by the core kernel team for the indefinate future. This 
is why it's up to Namesys to satisfy the concerns of the core team, not 
the other way around.
