Hi,
Another question I have about __init is whether stuff like this:
static inline int __init indy_sc_probe(void)
makes sense? I.e. will it make any function that calls it __init? Or will
__init be just ignored (as I doubt it is possible to throw away stuff from
the middle of some other function).
(my previous question was - can you confirm that it is meaningless to have
__init in front of init_module()?)
Regards,
Tigran.
