Hi Everyone,
In stead of Linux, I have a question about
doing a kernel patch to SUN's Solaris.
We are working on a project, and it turns out
we might have to modify the I/O's behavior.
Therefore, we are thinking to put in a kernel patch
to the Solaris OS.
Is there anything we need to consider before we
put in the patch such as:
(*) Whether need permission from SUN Microsystem
(*) Whether it would affect the service agreement
I would think many commercial package softwares
have done the same thing.(modify the OS's behavior)
Many thanks for your  input.
Mike.
