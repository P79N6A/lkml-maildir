Note that there are some applications for which it is a *bug* if an
mlocked page gets written out to magnetic media.  (gpg, for example.)
I imagine that they'd rather lose the mapping and get a page fault on
the next reference (which they can then fix up with a new mmap and
mlock) than have precious key material written to disk.
... unless, of course, the swap device is securely encrypted a la
OpenBSD's 'sysctl vm.swapencrypt.enable'.

However, I don't see how to implement a cryptographically secure swsusp.
(The importance of this behavior is obviously dependent on your threat
model.  Perhaps the Sufficiently Paranoid gpg users will simply need to
avoid using swsusp.)
