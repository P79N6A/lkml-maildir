Well, smaller stacks are better where possible, but there's nothing 
magic about 4k.  Sure, its mostly enough, but there's no particular 
reason to believe it will be enough for everything.  You could state a 
priori that all kernel code paths must fit into 4k of stack, but that's 
pretty arbitrary.
I'm tempted to post a patch making XFS depend on 8K stacks.  I know is 
simplistic, given that it seems to be xfs+lvm which is particularly 
problematic, and other filesystems+lvm are also a problem.  But its 
better than crashing.
