What exactly is useless bloat? Based on the level of indentation, I'd 
assume that Richard said that...care to elaborate?

Care to elaborate on that one, too? What does a userland daemon add to 
make it a sane design?

Yes, that's too much. 
MTRRs are one interface to an x86 CPU. CPUs are already represented in the
device tree. The proper thing to do would be to have the CPU suspend/ 
resume methods save and restore the MTRRs. It still requires an #ifdef in 
the CPU code, but with a little work, could be massaged down a ways.
