Is anyone using a machine simulator on Linux? 
A machine simulator simulates the behaviour of a
machine, including CPU ( s ) , memory, L1/2/3 caches,
buses, and other hardware devices. I think it helps if
we can run Linux under such a simulator. We can find
out the behaviour of application programs too.
The only machine simulator that I know is the SimOS
and it is open source. Does anyone get it work under
Linux or even get Linux work under it? BTW, is there
another simulator available?
SimOS: simos.stanford.edu
