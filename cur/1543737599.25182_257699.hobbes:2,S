correct, we are overriding it in schedule():
        if (likely(prev != next)) {
                next->timestamp = now;
                rq->nr_switches++;
the line your patch removes is a remnant of an earlier logic when we
timestamped tasks when they touched the runqueue. (vs. timestamping when
they actually run on a CPU.) So the patch looks good to me. Andrew, please
apply.
