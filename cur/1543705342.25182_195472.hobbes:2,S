Hello,
swap_out() seems always trying scan even if there are no swap space available.
This keeps CPU(s) busy with rare successful page-out and may cause lock
contention in big smp system.
  swap_out()
    ..
    try_to_swap_out()
      ..
      entry = get_swap_page()
      /* find no swap page available */
How about checking nr_swap_pages first and giving up if it's 0?
Applying the patch below extremely reduced systime consumption by swap_out
under swap space shortage.
Systems without swap also suffer from the same problem.
Any comments?
Best regards.
