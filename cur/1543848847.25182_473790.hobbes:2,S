I understand, but right at the moment, my priority is sorting out the
aic94xx driver so that it works with SATA devices.  It has become
apparent that there's some need for a bit of code sorting out in libata
to drive intelligent sas controllers, so we can take a look at bugs in
ata_dev_config_ncq() when someone's time frees up to look into the
libata issues.
