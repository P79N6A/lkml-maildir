I don't agree that's always been true by any means. It may currently
be true, but that's far from a good thing. The current state of divergance
the distros have from mainline 2.4 is IMHO the biggest problem Linux has
today.
The distros inherently have a conflict of interest getting changes merged
back into mainline ... it's time consuming to do, it provides them no real
benefit (they have to maintain their huge trees anyway), and it actively
damages the "value add" they provide.

If that's people's attitude ("you should use a vendor"), then we need a 
2.4-fixed tree to be run by somebody with an interest in providing 
critical bugfixes to the community with no distro ties. People may be
perfectly capable of finding, applying, and collecting their own patches,
but that's no reason to make it difficult.
