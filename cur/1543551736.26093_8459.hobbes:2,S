Strongly agree.  If the changes were an elegant solution to the ambiguities
I never would have cared.  In fact the whole reason I bothered to read the
patch in the first place was that I feel strongly that something like that
_was_ needed, but the solutions really seemed inferior to the original code
in terms of elegance of expression. (Well some of the original code was
pretty ugly too :-)
