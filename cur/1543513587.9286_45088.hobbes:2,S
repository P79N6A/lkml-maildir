Dear all
We are experiencing a crashing Squid/Linux problem: (we have had a problem
on 2 boxes with different spec and diff versions of squid/linux.
Squid source -  2.2.STABLE4-5.i386.rpm
RedHat Linux 6.0 with 2.2.5-22smp kernel
on a dual pentium-III 450, 512Mb, 32Gb Raid5 MylexDAC960
crashes with the following error:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 37d90014
Aiee, killing interupt handler
Kernel panic: attempted to kill the idle task!
in interrupt handler not syncing.
Is this a hardware problem or kernel problem - i.e. will upgrading the
kernel solve it?
Can anyone help?
Thanks
Steve
