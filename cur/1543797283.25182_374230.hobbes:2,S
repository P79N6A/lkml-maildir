Thanks again for the support. Yesterday night, I've checked your patch with the
latest git snapshot (2.6.15-rc5-ge4f5c82a), but it doesn't fix the bug(s) for.
2.6.15-rc5-ge4f5c82a unpatched showes up with:
[...cut due to out of screen...]
try_to_wake_up
__wake_up_common
__wake_up
__queue_work
call_usermodehelper_keys
__call_usermodehelper
kobject_hotplug
class_device_del
...
2.6.15-rc5-ge4f5c82a with your patch crashes differently:
[...cut due to out of screen...]
send_IPI_mask_bitmask
smp_send_reschedule
try_to_wake_up
__wake_up_common
__wake_up_sync
do_notify_parent
....
or: exactly the same patched kernel but at a later time with a different crash:
Badness in send_IPI_mask_bitmask at arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:167
send_IPI_mask_bitmask
smp_send_reschedule
__migrate_task
migration_thread
migration_thread
kthread
kthread
kernel_thread_helper
The attachments are three .gif images of the screen snapshots
of the above error messages (just some more details).
Any ideas?
Greets,
