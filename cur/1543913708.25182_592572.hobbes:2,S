I also want to find the way to make this implementation to be smaller.
Basically there is no such signal or message.
The cache for entries will be discarded when the inode cache is shrinked
or the file is closed (and the file object is destroyed), because it is
in inode or file object.
It is up to your system memory size or something when the inode cache is
shrinked.
