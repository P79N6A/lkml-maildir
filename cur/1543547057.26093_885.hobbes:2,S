hda and hdb each have their own queue, so we don't loose anything
there.

Right now the code in my tree looks something like this:
        for (i = 0; i < MAX_BLKDEV; i++) {
                request_queue_t *q = blk_get_queue(MKDEV(i, 0));
                if (!q)
                        continue;
		if (!active)
			continue;
		/* print stats */
	}
So it's not really that bad. I suppose things could be made quicker
by just browsing a list of active queues, but I'm not sure it's worth
the trouble (but hey, proove me wrong). Note that linking blk_dev
does not make much sense, since not all queues are available from
there. Drivers are free to use their own queue, even several if they
want.
