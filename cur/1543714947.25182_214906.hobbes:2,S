Not quite.  Both SCSI and IDE layers offer "generic" access for
sending commands to the device which the kernel doesn't understand.

I agree in this case: the touchpad should be handled by the input
layer, for uniformity if nothing else.
However, what happens when the thing connected to the PS/2 port isn't
a mouse or keyboard, just a strange device talking bytes?  With 2.4
kernels you could talk to it.
