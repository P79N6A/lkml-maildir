   I just happen to have an SC-SAT212 sitting in front of me, as a
replacement for my Adaptec 1210SA which doesn't work in Linux. :(
   The card is 64mm from the top edge to the bottom of the PCI pins,
and 56mm from the top edge to the edge of the "cutout" on the card
(i.e. the top edge of the PCI slot). Bear in mind though that the SATA
data cable is going to stick up at least 15mm beyond the top of the
card.

   I don't know for certain, *but* the AAR-1210SA definitely uses the
SiI3112 chip (slightly mangled), and I'd be surprised if Adaptec used
a different chip for the 1205SA. There's a picture of the 1210SA card
on Adaptec's site which is just about good enough to see the shape of
the word "SiI" on the chip surface -- there may be an equivalent
picture for the 1205SA.
   Bear in mind, though, that the 1210SA doesn't seem to play exactly
like other SiI3112 cards, and keeps dropping interrupts. This makes it
effectively useless for anything practical. You may want to take this
into account when thinking of Adaptec SATA kit.

   AFAIK, libata doesn't support SiI3112 yet. Jeff has promised it at
some point -- possibly as the next SATA chip to support.
