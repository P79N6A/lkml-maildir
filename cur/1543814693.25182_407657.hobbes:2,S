Well, I guess you can't ptrace an executable that you can't read.
# cd /bin
# ls -l ls
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 80008 2006-03-02 15:08 ls
# chmod 711 ls
# ls -l ls
-rwx--x--x 1 root root 80008 2006-03-02 15:08 ls
$ cd /bin
$ ls -l ls
-rwx--x--x 1 root root 80008 2006-03-02 15:08 ls

So I guess if you need to debug a system binary, you need it readable.
But I guess that can also be a security problem, and having system
binaries not readable, might make you system a little more secure.
