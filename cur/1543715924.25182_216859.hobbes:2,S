The problem is with corrupted data structures, pointers, etc.  An
evil/incompetently written driver can screw up data structures long
after it has been unloaded.  Historically, there was a time when a
certain set of propeitary six-letter video company beginning with 'N'
and ending with 'a' had serious bugs which would corrupt the kernel
and create random kernel panics far removed from the actual source of
the problems.
Stack overflows in a badly written device driver can overwrite task
structures and cause apparent filesystem problems which are blamed on
the hapless filesystem authors instead of where the blame properly
lies, namely the device driver author.
The thing we could do kernel-side is to implement full VM protections.
This is the microkernel approach; the problem though is the
performance overhead of having to go through protection boundaries,
setting up kernel-module-specific VM page tables, etc., etc.  At some
level, if people could implement these propeitary code bases in
userspace, then there would be no need to risk corrupting internal
data structures, and no need to "taint" the kernel.  But usually there
are performance reasons why the driver authors choose not to go down
that path.
