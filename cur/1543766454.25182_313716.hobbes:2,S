More generally: 
1. the files exported by the FUSE filesystem should not be accessible
   by other users.
2. The user should see exactly the same files from any login session.
These can be satisfied in various ways.  Permission checking, or by
making FUSE mounts invisible to other users, or with private
namespaces (in increasing complexity).
Thanks,
Miklos
