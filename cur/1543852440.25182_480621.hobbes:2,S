but if you do this you just end up with a bigger backlog so that the
next one will even be more unstable due to a extreme high change rate.

most are mostly false. And the rest is getting looked at. What's the
problem?

and all this fixing is happening AS WELL as new features. What makes you
think suddenly even more fixing will happen?

this is where the OSDL Documentation Person will help a lot; a full time
person.

I doubt it; most have gotten real good at avoiding getting a huge patch
backlog since that is just incredibly expensive ;)

).
and at this years Kernel Summit actual data and general consensus showed
this was unfounded fear; the bugrates are more or less stable, but with
many more users.

No it shows that bugs are getting fixed and delivered to you
IMMEDIATELY. Many many of the -stable things fixed are not in new
things. Is there anything in the -stable process that is not working for
you?
