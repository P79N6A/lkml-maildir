Even if your swap file seems full of data could contain nothing of useful. 
You could have orpahend swap entried that are waiting to be reclaimed back
(the next time your machine will need memory). If you'll do a swapoff -a
the thing will disappear (and both some RAM and swap will be released).
I have a fix for that and it's also in my
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.1_arca-2.gz
 .
Maybe leaving the swap entries in the swap cache is an optimization but
AFIK nobody did some benchmark with or without my patch.
