The above stanza still needs some tlc.  I built a 2.6.22.1-rt6 (rt5 wouldn't 
build) using the same old config that a make oldconfig didn't fuss about, but 
the reboot never completed, see the attached, heavily smunched camera shot of 
the panic.
Kinda looks like hda/sda confusion, with rt3 (this boot), its hda*, what is it 
now?  fstab or kernel config error?
