Problems rebooting here. Don't have them in 2.6.10 and 2.6.11-rc1.
If you want complete messages, just ask. I will write them down into 
electronic form.
First time there was an unstoppable infinite loop of quickly moving USB 
related messages. I only saw "[uhci_hcd]" string reliably. Can't reproduce.
Third time:
[<c0113160>] do_page_fault+0x0/0x562
[<c010398f>] error_code+0x2b/0x30
[<c0113160>] do_page_fault+0x0/0x562
[<c01133fe>] do_page_fault+0x97/0x562
	[repeat several times to fit console]
Code: [snip]
 <0> Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt.
Second time:
[<c0113160>] do_page_fault+0x0/0x562
[<c0113160>] do_page_fault+0x0/0x562
[<c01133fe>] do_page_fault+0x29e/0x562
	[many tty related functions snipped]
[<c0113160>] do_page_fault+0x0/0x562
[<c0113160>] do_page_fault+0x0/0x562
[<c01133fe>] do_page_fault+0x29e/0x562
Code: [snip]
 <0> Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt.
Other than that everything seems to be ok.
