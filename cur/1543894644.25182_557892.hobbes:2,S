Detail: I think that is a good idea if hard-users (as kernel developers) 
had a local to host yours .config file, specifying hadware.
E.g. I have a laptop Toshiba M45-S355 (with ReiserFS) and don't have 
experience to choose what I can remove from kernel (or compile as 
module/built-in).
So, is a great idea use pre-config file to compile a new kernel with 
best options.
My .config file (2.6.21.1) and lspci is attached.
