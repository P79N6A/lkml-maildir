Especially since Hans has been providing strong disincentive to  
review of his code.  Personal attacks are not exactly productive  
along those lines.  Perhaps it might be best if the code reviewers  
were to work directly with Vladimir Saveliev, Alexander Zarochentcev,  
etc to get the issues resolved directly with minimal political  
posturing.  Hans, no offense, but you've been trying really hard to  
get everybody qualified to review your code to reconsider such  
action.  Maybe you should step back and let the programmers work out  
issues on their own.
Cheers,
