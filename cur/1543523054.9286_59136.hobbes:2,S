Hi Guys,
I have a new Dell Inspiron 7500 system, and I have just installed Red 
Hat 6.1 on it. However my Linux partition is located such that it 
spans the 1024 cylinder boundary on my hard disk (13Gig EIDE), and 
although System Commander trys to boot it, there is no valid 
bootsector on the partition. When I booted off a floppy and tried to 
re-run lilo, it complained about not being able to get past the 1024 
cylinder boundary (and obviously did not install the boot sector).
According to the System Commander folks, most new OS'es such as 
Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 can boot to partitions past the 1024 
cylinder limit. So I am wondering if there is something I can do to 
solve this problem on my system, and get Linux to boot?
I also want to solve this because I plan to upgrade my disk to 25Gig 
so I can add more OS'es to it (such as FreeBSD and BeOS), but if I 
can't boot those OS'es past 8Gig there is not much point!
Regards,
