I don't see any other equivalent teminology besides my "classzone" word
existing, if we standardize on "alloc_type" to only mean a classzone
then I'd be fine to giveup on my wording, I don't care to retain my
wording, but to me classzone sounds more self explanatory than
alloc_type (though I must be biased having invented that word).
