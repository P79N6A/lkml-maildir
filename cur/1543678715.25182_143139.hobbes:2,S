Appending psmouse_noext to the kernel works, but basically i get a lot
of this when I try to move my synaptics touchpad without it:
Synaptics driver lost sync at 4th byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver resynced.
But the cursor goes nowhere. Would gpm work at all with the new
driver? I know I would need a new X11 driver for the mouse...
