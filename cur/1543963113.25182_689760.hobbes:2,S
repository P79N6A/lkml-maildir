ok, indeed my suggestion is wrong and this would not be a good 
comparison.
another idea: my trial-baloon patch should test your theory too, because 
the generic down_trylock() is still the 'fat' version, it does:
        spin_lock_irqsave(&sem->lock, flags);
        count = sem->count - 1;
        if (likely(count >= 0))
                sem->count = count;
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&sem->lock, flags);
if there is a noticeable performance difference between your 
trial-ballon patch and mine, then the micro-cost of the BKL very much 
matters to this workload. Agreed about that?
but i'd be _hugely_ surprised about it. The tty code's BKL use should i 
think only happen when a task exits and releases the tty - and a task 
exit - even if this is a threaded test (which AIM7 can be - not sure 
which exact parameters Yanmin used) - the costs of thread creation and 
thread exit are just not in the same ballpark as any BKL micro-costs. 
Dunno, maybe i overlooked some high-freq BKL user. (but any such site 
would have shown up before) Even assuming a widening of the critical 
path and some catastrophic domino effect (that does show up as increased 
scheduling) i've never seen a 40% drop like this.
this regression, to me, has "different scheduling behavior" written all 
over it - but that's just an impression. I'm not going to bet against 
you though ;-)
