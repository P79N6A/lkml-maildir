I assume you aren't talking about kgdb stuff here (or what would be the
point of going so early) but I believe he was talking about allowing for
stuff that could be done early, to be done early.

What I'm suggesting is that we don't need this table stuff at all.
Roughly:
- Call kgdb_entry(), minus the kgdb_serial->hook(), as early as
  possible.
- We do early parsing of some cmd opts (this I believe is __early_setup)
  - This means that to use kgdboe you _must_ pass kgdboe=whatever, same
    for 8250, etc.  This would also do kgdb_serial = kgdboe_serial, or
    whatever.
  - 8250, kgdboe, etc, must be able to init themselves.
- If ('gdb' || 'kgdbwait') && kgdb_serial != NULL -> breakpoint();
