It has been shown before that this has these disadvantages:
1. More work settting up those access bits   (bloat & perf. degradation)
2. Some programs actually need an exec stack (loss of features)
3. It don't buy you _any_ security at all!   (didn't help anyway)
About (3): Of course it stops some of the current exploits, but there is
a trivial way to "enhance" stack-smashing exploits to work around the
non-exec stack:
You can still overwrite the function's return address, on that non-exec 
stack.  The cracker can no longer upload code and make the function 
return to that, but crackers don't need to!  All they need is to return 
to a place containing exec("/bin/sh") *and such places exist*, 
paritcularly in every program using libc.  So writing the the exploit
becomes a little harder, using it is as trivial as ever.
Spend the time fixing broken apps, or get them right from the start.  It 
is not as if writing safe C is _hard_.
