Linux Kernel programmers in Los Angeles, unite...
I'm interested in testing and tuning the new F_SETSIG/SIGIO feature,
and would love to chat about it over a beer with anyone
doing similar stuff.
If there are enough Angelinos interested in working on the
Linux kernel, maybe we can form a SIG; meetings might well
take place at a local pub, so we can fortify us for our
expeditions into the kernel sources.
Drop me a line if you're interested.
