Which is unfortunately wrong if you want the parport subsystem on x86
but won't be using the parport_pc driver with it.  I.e. you'll be using
some other driver which isn't part of the kernel tree.  Perhaps a
modified version of parport_pc, perhaps something else.
The default should be PARPORT_PC==y, but it's actually valid for some
applications to _require_ PARPORT_PC==n or PARPORT_PC==m.
