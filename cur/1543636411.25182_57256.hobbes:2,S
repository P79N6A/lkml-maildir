I just gave 2.5.26 a whirl.  The first thing I noticed was
that the hotplug system didn't run the script for my usb
modem...
kernel: usb.c: USB disconnect on device 2
kernel: hub.c: new USB device 00:0b.0-2, assigned address 4
kernel: usb.c: USB device 4 (vend/prod 0x6b9/0x4061) is not claimed by any active driver.
/etc/hotplug/usb.agent: ... no modules for USB product 6b9/4061/0
however this works just fine with 2.4.19-rc1 and 2.5.24 (i.e. only difference
is the change in kernel)...
All the best,
Duncan.
