   The existing TODO type list I refer to are those produced by Kenneth C.
   Arnold ( 
http://kena.8k.com/linux-kernel/
 ) (who is doing a fine job I might
   add) and formerly by Alan Cox.
I've taken a look at that list, and it looks fairly obsolete, as far as
I could tell.  There is an actively maintained list which I post
periodically to the Linux-Kernel mailing list, and which is also
available at:
	www://linux24.sourceforge.net
   I was looking through the current versions of the kernel, was re-reading
   through some past "TODO before release" sort of messages, and was wondering,
   could these TODO type of items be included in an actual TODO file at the
   source top level (or in the Documentation if this would be more appropriate)
   and/or included in each level like some of the other areas, (like fs) areas
   seem to have?  Either that or move all the TODO into the top level one, with
   the top level being segmented to the areas of relevance (like a mm, fs, etc
   sections).
The problem is that it's easier for the list to be maintained when it's
outside of the kernel tree; it means that bugs can get added to it
without waiting for the next kernel rev, for example.   (I only
periodically post an updated list to the L-K list, but the linux24
webpage gets updated more frequently than that.)
I do keep the fixed bugs at the bottom of the list, but it's probably at
a level of detail which is *far* more detailed than what you would want
to see in the top-level Changes file in the kernel.
