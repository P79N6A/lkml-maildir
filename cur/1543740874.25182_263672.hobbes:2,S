OK I just went and installed mozilla mail to see what the problem is and
it's worse than I thought.
The problem is that Mozilla does not grok the standard X clipboard at
all.
Try these tests:
1. Highlight some text in an xterm.  Paste with middle button into
Mozlla  mail window.  Then paste with the middle button into vim.  Both
work BUT the patch is whitespace damaged.
2. Run diff foo bar | xclip.  Paste with middle button into Mozilla.
Nothing.  Then paste with middle button into vim.  Works.
#2 would not mangle the patch IF it worked which it doesn't.  Mozilla
does not have a setting to insert a text file.  So many people just do
#1.
No wonder people are mangling patches, the Mozilla mail client is very
broken.  PLEASE, file bug reports!
