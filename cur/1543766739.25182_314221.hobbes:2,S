Hate to admit ignorance, but I'm not really sure what SCTP does..  I
guess point to point communication like tcp but with some other kind of
characteristics..  I wanted to have some idea of how locking messages
are related to the current membership.  I think I understand the system
from your descriptions and reading the code.  One scenario I could see
happeing is that there are 2 processors A, B.
B drops out of membership
A sends lock to lock master B (but A doens't know B has dropped out of
membership yet)
B gets lock request, but has dropped out of membership or failed in some
way
In this case the order of lock messages with the membership changes is
important.  This is the essential race that describes almost every issue
with distributed systems...  virtual synchrony makes this scenario
impossible by ensuring that messages are ordered in relationship to
membership changes.
Do you intend to eventually move the point to point communication into
userspace, or keep it within kernel?  I'd like to understand if there is
a general need for cluster communication as a kernel service, or the
intent is for all communication to be done in userspace...
You guys have done a good job here...  
Can I ask a performance question..  How many locks per second can be
acquired and then released with a system of 2-3 processors?  In the case
that the processor requesting the lock is on the lock server processor,
and in the case that the processor requesting the lock is not on the
lock server processor...  (processor in this case is the system that
processes the lock operations).  Assuming all locks are uncontended...
