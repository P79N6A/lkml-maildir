Isn't it the case for Intel 386 and up processors, as is true for other
modern processors, that memory segments can be marked execute, read and/or
write by a process running at a sufficiently high privilege level. So if you
write your kernel to take advantage of these features, you could guard
against the case where a buffer overflow is used to sneak code into an
otherwise secure system?
I suppose my original question could be boiled down into:
Does a Linux (and/or other Unix) process inhabit a single read/write/execute
memory segment?
