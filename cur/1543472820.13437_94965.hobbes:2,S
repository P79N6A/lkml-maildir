Subject: ppa module dependencies, 2.1.131ac13

I have a non-SCSI sytem with a parallel port iomega zip drive.
I am running 2.1.131ac13, SCSI, parport, ppa all compiled as module
Since the zip drive is the only SCSI device I have the following in my
modules.conf:
	alias block-major-8       ppa
However when I try to mount it, it does not automatically load the
required sd_mod module; it has to be inserted by hand.
Here the dependencies for the ppa module:
/lib/modules/2.1.131/scsi/ppa.o: /lib/modules/2.1.131/scsi/scsi_mod.o /lib/modules/2.1.131/misc/parport.o
Shouldn't sd_mod.o be in there, too? Instead of scsi_mod.o even as sd_mod.o
depends on scsi_mod.o? Or am I missing something?
Regards,
Georg
