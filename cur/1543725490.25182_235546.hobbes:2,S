Mr. Giese,
Thank you for your response.
As you wrote TCP_NODELAY is used to turn off Nagle. As per theory this
algo will be running at the sender side and delay acks at the reciever
side. If I turn off Nagel at sender side, wont this lead to the silly
window syndrome ??
Also is it true that Nagles algo and hence delay acks come into play only
if the packet size is small ??
Thanks,
Rahul.
