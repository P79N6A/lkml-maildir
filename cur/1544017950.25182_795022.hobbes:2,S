There are a few things I don't like about it:
	In usb_hcd_pci_suspend, the failure path for 
	pci_set_power_state doesn't undo all the changes
	that have already been made.  In fact, the easiest
	way to do the rest of the recovery probably is to
	call usb_hcd_pci_resume directly.
	In the !has_pci_pm path we don't call pci_set_power_state.
	This means controllers with legacy power management won't
	get suspended.  Maybe pci_set_power_state should be
	called always, and has_pci_pm be used only for
	interpreting the return code and printing debug messages.
	In usb_hcd_pci_resume, the pci_wake_from_d3 call
	should be moved up right next to the pci_enable_wake
	call.  It makes no sense for them to be separated by
	pci_enable_device and pci_set_master.  After all,
	even if you can't re-enable the device you probably
	don't want it to continue being a wakeup source.
	It's a little annoying that several debug messages
	in usb_hcd_pci_resume have been removed.  Can't we
	display the power state upon entry, before trying to
	change it?
	It stands out that the resume method contains no call
	to match pci_set_power_state() in the suspend method.
	There should at least be a comment about it.
Some of these problems predate Rafael's patch.  Given that it has 
already helped a number of people, we might want to merge the patch 
and then make additional changes to address these issues.
