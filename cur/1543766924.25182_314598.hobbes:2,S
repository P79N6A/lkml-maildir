I don't think b) happens, because thread 1 has to have finished all
its writes before the page will end writeback and thread 2 can go
anywhere.

Well you really don't need to hold the page locked for that long.
block_read_full_page, nobh_prepare_write both use the same sort of
array of buffer heads logic - I think it makes sense not to touch
any buffers after submitting them all for IO...?
