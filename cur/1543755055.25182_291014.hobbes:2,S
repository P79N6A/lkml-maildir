The AUX and KBD ports share the same processor interface. If the AUX
port is enabled, and somehow keeps the interface for itself, then the
keyboard wouldn't work.
For some reason, however, the keyboard is recognized, which means it
_can_ communicate with the kernel. I don't understand why it doesn't, at
the moment.

The kernel issues the AUX_TEST command, which instructs the port
controller to test whether the port is OK. And the controller returns
with "Yes, it is."

Remember, it's the keyboard that doesn't work in that case. How the
kernel should know the AUX port is the cause, and how it should discern
that from the user not typing?

No.

We're pretty happy when it works on functional hardware at the moment.
