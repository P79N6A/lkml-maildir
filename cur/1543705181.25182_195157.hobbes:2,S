Ok, just trying it out. So far:
Doing the kernel patch to 2.6.2-rc3, it asks me about a file missing in 
xfs. I skipped it. Then I used your patch you sent to lkml to fix things 
up. Finally I applied the core patch. Now it asks me
The next patch would create the file kernel/power/swsusp2.c,
which already exists!  Assume -R? [n]
Should this happen? What to do now?
