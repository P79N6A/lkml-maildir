Right, if you compile it into the kernel, it will obviously work. But
if you compile it as a module *without* also requesting KMOD, then it
will not work *even when* you manually insmod the required modules.
Or at least, thats been my experience. Maybe I didn't load all the
required modules, now that I think of it - without kmod, it would have
been missing slhc and the other compression modules. Sigh.
anyway, things that can be compiled a module *and* require a major
device number that is also implemented with a module should verify
that KMOD is turned on.
