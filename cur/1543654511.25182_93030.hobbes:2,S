That seems broken to me.  IIRC, when all this uaccess stuff went in back
in 2.1 times, the original intention was that __get_user() would fault
even when used from kernel mode, unless set_fs(KERNEL_DS) was in effect.
__get_user() at that time was always meant to be used as a faster version
of get_user(), even by generic code, and relied solely on the TLB protection
mechanisms, whereas get_user() verified the address.
Gah, I _really_ wish that we had a method to notify architecture maintainers
when this type of stuff changes.  Are we supposed to re-read the x86
implementation of everything for each kernel release to try to discover
what subtle semantics have changed?
