-------- Original-Nachricht --------
Hi.
Today i did a git pull to be up to date again and i noticed in the
powertop tool that i'll get this new entry
  14,2% (  9,1)     <kernel core> : sky2_probe (sky2_idle)
with around 10 interrupts per second.
i think (i.e. i don't know and just guessing!) this commit is
responsible for these wake ups:
git show eb35cf60e462491249166182e3e755d3d5d91a28

    [PATCH] sky2: stop/start hardware idle timer on suspend/resume
    The resume bug was caused not by an early interrupt but because the idle
    timeout was not being stopped on suspend.  Also disable hardware IRQ's
    on suspend.  Will need to revisit this with hotplug?

Any ideas?
