Hi all,
I get an oops when I boot my kernel with usbdevices plugged in.
If I unplug them the booting continues and I can insert and remove them and 
make them work
Devices are : USB Bluetooth dongle and PEN Flash drive
Cannot show EXACT backtrace because it scrolls of the screen and cannot find 
any logging after reboot.  I do see usb_storage in the backtrace.
How Can I send you the complete backtrace ?
