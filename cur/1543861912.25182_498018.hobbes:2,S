I have updated the patchset against 2620-rc3-mm1, incorporated various
cleanups suggested during last review. Please let me know if I have missed
anything:
It should show up at
www.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/people/suparna/aio/2620-rc3-mm1
Brief changelog:
- Reworked against the block layer unplug changes 
- Switched from defines to inlines for init_wait_bit* etc (per akpm)
- Better naming:  __lock_page to lock_page_async (per hch, npiggin)
- Kill lock_page_slow wrapper and rename __lock_page_slow to lock_page_slow
  (per hch)
- Use a helper function aio_restarted() (per hch)
- Replace combined if/assignment (per hch)
- fix resetting of current->io_wait after ->retry in aio_run_iocb (per zab)
I have run my usual aio-stress variations script
(www.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/people/suparna/aio/aio-results.sh)
