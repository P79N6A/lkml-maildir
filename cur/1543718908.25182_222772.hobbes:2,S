I know you want this simple, but should we keep the paper-trail momentum
going by adding a "Submitted-by"? Like if I get a one-liner fix, which
is obviously not adding new code, rather than go through the whole
process of asking for them to agree to the signoff deal, could I do:
Submitted-by: Jimmy Janitor <jimmy@janitor.blah>
Signed-off-by: Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>
? I like the idea of knowing where a patch came from and via who. This
would make it easier to analyze that info, but keep it simple for
trivial patches that so many of us get (in the (b) case).
