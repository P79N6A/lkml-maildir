Yup, I was confusing myself a bit on the return symantics of
try_to_wake_up, and the relationship with race between changing
task->state and scheduling a task off a cpu (the "array" test while
holding the rq lock.).  
The feeling that this was likely wrong was eating at me all evening and
then it came to me around 8pm when I was driving my son to some thing.
