Okay, the problem seems to be the port reset.  In parport_pc.c, just
before the call to parport_announce_port, we set two control lines one by
one.  If you comment out that whole lot, you should find that the
autoprobe works reliably.  I'll do a proper patch tomorrow.
Does anyone have any strong objections to my removing the port reset at
initialisation?  I'll make sure that tunelp can cause a reset via lp
(which I think is also broken at the moment).
Tim.
