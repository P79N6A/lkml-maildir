Could you try to trigger this problem?
eg cpu1 owns the spinlock:
write DATA
spin_unlock, ie write LOCK_1
cpu2 acquires the lock:
"asm: read LOCK_1; read DATA", the cpu could reorder the read operation.
if cpu2 gets the lock, then it has seen the "write LOCK_1" from cpu1.
but this automagically means that it has also seen the "write DATA" from
cpu1.
It seems that the cpu discards speculative reads if it sees a write
operation on
the system bus (I tried to force a speculative read, and my proggy never
failed)

BUT: I don't know if we should rely on this: 15 ticks vs 22 ticks is not a
very large
difference, and I don't know if this behaviour is guaranteed.
Ingo, do your new spin_lock() functions clobber any registers? This would
further
increase the costs in "real life".
Cheers,
