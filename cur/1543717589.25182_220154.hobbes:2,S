Like something that turns KEEPCAPS on then setuid()s then executes an 
untrusted program?  It's obviously wrong, but it's secure currently 
since the exec wipes capabilities.  And no one would notice.  Ugh!

The prctl would defeat the purpose (imagine if bash forgot the prctl -- 
then the whole thing is pointless).  I'll cook up the boot parameter in 
the next couple days (probably with a config option and some kind of 
warning that the old behavior is deprecated).  Is it a problem if I make 
the changes to init's state unconditional?  (I still don't see why 
CAP_SETPCAP is dangerous for root to have...)
The only concern is that some new code relies on the new inheritable 
semantics.  That shouldn't be so bad, though, since that's just an extra 
precaution (if there are insecure setuid binaries around, you already 
have problems).
