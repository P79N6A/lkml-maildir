Is this only for 2.6.x or does it also include 2.4.x and 2.2.x
I ask this because I will need to submit a patch for the farsync WAN drivers
soon which will need to be applied to all three kernels.
Regards
Kevin

Applied.
Please, Krzysztof, linux-kernel and Linus are not the appropriate place to
submit networking (device driver or otherwise) patches.
Therefore, in the future send it to netdev@oss.sgi.com and CC: either Jeff
Garzik or myself, thanks.
I'd also not classify this patch as trivial, it's not like a missing
semicolon or a comment typo, real thought needs to be applied to analyzing
whether your fix were correct or not.
