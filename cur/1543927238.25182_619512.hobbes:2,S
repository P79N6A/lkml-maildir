It looks like the problem is that even though we set the DMA mask after 
we allocate the PRD and pad buffers, when the other port is set up, the 
DMA mask is already over 64-bit and so it allocates its buffers over 4GB 
and fails. I think we just need to explicitly set to 32-bit first, 
getting the reporter to try that one now.
