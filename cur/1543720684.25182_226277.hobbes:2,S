"make help" shows:
    ...
    Configuration targets:
      oldconfig       - Update current config utilising a line-oriented program
      menuconfig      - Update current config utilising a menu based program
      xconfig         - Update current config utilising a QT based front-end
      gconfig         - Update current config utilising a GTK based front-end
      defconfig       - New config with default answer to all options
      allmodconfig    - New config selecting modules when possible
      allyesconfig    - New config where all options are accepted with yes
      allnoconfig     - New minimal config
A person trying to upgrade from 2.4 would suppose that the 2.4 .config
won't work and  would likely start with "make  allmodconfig", and then
"make {menu/x}config".   With 100s (or 1000s)  of configuration items,
it is not easy for a 2.4-er to discover that one now has to explicitly
enable i8042 and atkbd.  So, it is likely for him to have:
        CONFIG_SERIO=m
        CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=m
