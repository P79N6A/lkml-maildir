Looks extremally serious to me.
The SCRIPTS processor should be fetching CHMOV DSA relative when DATA_IN
instructions. This corresponds to opcode 0x11000000.
However, it seems to have fetched instruction 0x0b000000 which is a 
MOVE ABSOLUTE WHEN STATUS PHASE.
In (3-21-0) we can see that the chip is expecting STATUS PHASE (3), but
the target is driving DATA IN phase (21 - the 1 indicates DATA IN phase).
In other word, the SCRIPTS processor seems to have fetched a bogus
instruction. The signaled 'illegal instruction detected' may be due to the 
count of bytes to transfer to be zero.
