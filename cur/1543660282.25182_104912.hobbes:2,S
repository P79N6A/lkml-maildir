"seems to make"?  This is too vague for me to comment on, unfortunately.
What applications?  What measurements have been made?
It can only affect creation of new threads, not the switching between extant
ones.

The problem has existed in 2.4 since 2.4.20-pre5.  The context switch
problem will only exhibit for small periods of time (say, 10's to 100's of
milliseconds) when the filesystem is under heavy write load.
A patch for 2.4 is at
