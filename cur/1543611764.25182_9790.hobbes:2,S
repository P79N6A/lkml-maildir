That's exactly the Linus point: no long term preventive design.
That means short term design on what we actually have or on what we can
think available in a very near future.
Because, again, if you start designing now an SMP solution for 128 CPUs,
you're going to model it on the current technology that won't probably fit
in future SMP architectures and you'll be screwed up.
There should be a reason why software evolves in this way, think about it.
Either everyone else is fool or you're the prophet.
And if you're the prophet and you think that the future of multiprocessing
is UP on clusters, why instead of spreading your word between us poor
kernel fans don't you pull out money from your pocket ( or investors ) and
start a new Co. that will have that solution has primary and unique goal ?
You could be the J.C. Maxwell of the next century.
