Subject: read() on relayfs channel returns premature 0

Hi 
I'm using relayfs to relay data from a kernel module to user space on
a SuSE 2.6.5 kernel.  I'm not absolutely sure what version of relayfs
has been back ported to it.
While reading data from the channel I've been seeing read() return 0
prematurely.  However, the 0 does not signify that the file is being
closed for there is still data available afterwards.  
I've noticed that zeros occur when roughly one page of data has been
read.  I suspect that they occur whenever there is a read across the
relayfs sub-buffers.
Now I understand that this is not the latest release of relayfs (there
are the redux patches, which I have yet to try).  Nonetheless I'd like
to know whether this behaviour is deliberate.  Is it? 
Thanks,

P.S. I've been able to get around this by deliberately modifying
do_read() with the attached patch.  I'm not absolutely sure its
correct but it seems to work.
