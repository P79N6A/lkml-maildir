Actually, my reasons may sound a little strange, but basically I'd be
fine with HZ=1000 if it wasn't for that annoying ~1 kHz sound when the
CPU is idle (probably bad capacitors). By increasing HZ to 10 kHz, the
sound is at a frequency where the ear is much less sensitive. Anyway, I
thought some people might be interested in high HZ for other (more
fundamental) reasons, so I posted the patch.
