My lockless juggling with six variables was indeed broken.  Who would
have expected that.  So here is an update, also with a more realistic
patch title.
Without the patch, _all_ ongoing I/O during bus resets will _always_
fail.  With the patch, a lot but sadly not all I/O will survive.  But at
least this stuff is enough of an improvement while not too invasive to
be considered for upstream inclusion in a later 2.6.25-rc.

Subject: firewire: fw-sbp2: (try to) avoid I/O errors during reconnect
While fw-sbp2 takes the necessary time to reconnect to a logical unit
after bus reset, the SCSI core keeps sending new commands.  They are all
immediately completed with host busy status, and application clients or
filesystems will break quickly.  The SCSI device might even be taken
offline:  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9734
The only remedy seems to be to block the SCSI device until reconnect.
Alas the SCSI core has no useful API to block only one logical unit i.e.
the scsi_device, therefore we block the entire Scsi_Host.  This
currently corresponds to an SBP-2 target.  In case of targets with
multiple logical units, we need to satisfy the dependencies between
logical units by carefully tracking the blocking state of the target and
its units.  We block all logical units of a target as soon as one of
them needs to be blocked, and keep them blocked until all of them are
ready to be unblocked.
Furthermore, as the history of the old sbp2 driver has shown, the
scsi_block_requests() API is a minefield with high potential of
deadlocks.  We therefore take extra measures to keep logical units
unblocked during __scsi_add_device() and during shutdown.
This avoids I/O errors during reconnect in many but alas not in all
cases.  There may still be errors after a re-login had to be performed.
Also, some bridges have been seen to cease fetching management ORBs if
I/O went on up until a bus reset.  In these cases, all management ORBs
time out after mgt_orb_timeout.  The old sbp2 driver is less vulnerable
or maybe not vulnerable to this, for as yet unknown reasons.

Update:
  - included patch "firewire: fw-sbp2: preemptively block sdev"
  - converted from lockless to spinlock protected accesses due to too
    many interdependencies
  - updated patch description WRT how well the fix works.
