Users lived with this on the Amiga, Users lived with this on
Windows. Just add a notification callback which is called when the
kernel wants to sync the floppy, let your desktop add a handler which
pops a requester "Please insert floppy "foobla" (as far as I know,
there is a unique identifier for both ext2 and DOS) in Drive
"/dev/fd0".
Worked on the Amiga for me. Why not also on Linux? If there is no
hander installed: Bad luck for the user. You asked for it.
