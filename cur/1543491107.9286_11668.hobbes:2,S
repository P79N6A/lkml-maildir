Hi Ted,
There are underlying bugs with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS that go deeper
than that.  Jakub has a fix, and I have a design for a different fix.
We failed to come to agreement last time around but maybe this time we'll
reach critical mass (read: I will be less stubborn and more pragmatic).
For the curious, the bug is: the modversions files need to depend
on the configuration used, so that they get re-made when the configuration
changes.
Riley's changes are OK, although I don't know if they hit every file
needed.  But that's just a band-aid (better than the current situation
though).  I personally view 'make clean' in a build process the same
way that I view re-booting an operating system when an application hangs.
It shouldn't be necessary.
Michael
