I've had some time to think about this.  As a programmer, I am lothe to 
re-invent any wheel that someone else already has.  I think this may be how 
you guys came to this decision.

It's beginning to sound like you may be able to leverage the work that went 
into MD and LVM and consentrate on (perhapse) some really cool stuff, like 
partition-level encyption, or the disk partitioning scheme involving RAID, 
NBD's and LVM that Alan Cox outlined in another post.

As I said in a different post, that was a cheep shot on my part.  I'm usually 
much bigger than that.  
So, let me try to understand.  The EVMS team is going to rip out the guts of 
their user-land utils in order to comply with the existing (mainstream) API, 
and abandon their own API.  This should reduce the amount of code actually in 
the kernel.  (ignoring the user-land v. kernel-level discovery debate)
Na, I can't ignore the debate.  I can't wait to see how user-land descovery 
will be implemented.  There is something intrinsically "nice" about having an 
OS automatically discover every aspect of a machine I'm installing on.  I 
guess it's going to fall to the Linux distributors to package this system 
well.  If they don't, first-time Mandrake or RH installers will be doomed to 
that (shudder) other operating system.

I'll just have to wait.  BTW, Kevin, if you are ever in Albuquerque, NM.  let 
me know; I still owe you a beer. <grin>
