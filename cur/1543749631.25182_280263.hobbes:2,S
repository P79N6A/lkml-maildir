No one has posted a reply to this point, so here's one even if it is 
unnecessary.
What matters is not which modules are loaded, but rather which modules 
bind to which devices.  If ub is configured then usb-storage will not bind 
to certain devices, regardless of what modules are loaded.
Problems start arising when devices that ub binds to and usb-storage 
doesn't (when ub is configured) fail to work with ub, or work much more 
slowly than they do with usb-storage.  And since some distributions enable 
ub in their shipping configurations, users often don't realize what has 
happened -- they only know that things don't work as well as they used to.
Maybe a reasonable answer would be to ask distributors not to enable ub,
and leave it up to individual users to configure it when they want to.  
That is the default setting in Kconfig, after all.
