Oh oh, looks like I need a lesson in bash then.  The whole basic idea 
of what I was doing there was for the parent shell to go away, 
leaving the child process sitting there until its done some 10 
seconds later.  If I didn't do that, then cron seemed to hang on the 
first execution as if was dutifully waiting for bash to exit...
The bash manual I have is both too concise, and too verbose because 
bash is as close to emac's as I can think of when looking for a 
universal executer.
In the crontab its this:
00 05 * * *     /root/bin/its-daylight
Then /root/bin/its-daylight calls 2 other scripts using the "&" 
syntax.
So I guess its time to RTFM on bash again.
Thanks.
Now, to get this back on-thread..
I switched the memory sticks to each others sockets this afternoon.  
And "memburn 512" megabytes, which puts me into the swap about 70 
megs, is still running with no detected errors in 1162 loops.  About 
4:30 elapsed time so far.  I've got all my fingers and toes crossed, 
and everything but tied a knot in it, hoping this may be the end of 
the problem.  If not, then the nightmare continues.
