It's no joke. Some companies require, in the process of producing
goods and services, that certain interface code and documentation
be provided. For instance, if I make an Ethernet card, it's in
the best interest of the company to sell as many boards as possible.
Therefore, certain information must be given away to obtain those
goals. So, I would provide register-level documentation, sample
source-code, and maybe even drivers for the majority of the known
Operating Systems.
However, If my company makes Bomb Scanners (it does), I cannot
divulge to potential adversaries, either the competition or potential
bombers, how it works. It's just that simple.
If your end product is a board that plugs into a PC, you have a
different set of rules than if your end product is a Bomb Scanner,
a Flight Management System, or a Numerical Milling Machine.
Basically, embedded stuff, both hardware and software, remains hidden.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
