And that is wrong.
See following example:
static void __init foo_init()
{
	if (error)
		foo_exit();
}
static void __exit foo_exit()
{
}
If foo_init is annotated with __init_exit then in the build-in case it
become __init and there is a reference to a non existing function because
functions marked __exit are discarded during link or run-time (depending on arch).
If foo_exit() are marked __init_exit then it becomes __init in the non-module case
which seems coorrect. If this is the intention of the patch then it should
be OK but then this intention should be spelled out.
