    Well, in my experience, values of PC (or EIP is x86 speak) rarely
    appear over column 50 on the screen.  Therefore, removing them is
    only going to save width, not height.
The EIP is not pushed out of sight horizontally, but vertically.
(Maybe you never saw a i386 oops. With [<>] the call trace takes
twice as many lines (on a 25x80 screen) as without.)
    Also, have you considered that not every oops is formatted exactly
    the same way on every architecture?
    Do you propose to teach klogd and ksymoops every single oops format style?
It is a triviality.
Besides, the patch only modified i386.
