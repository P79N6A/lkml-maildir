Ah, missed that. ok I guess it makes sense to use the same
encoding as ACPI, no need to be intentionally different.

Defining it as "as defined in the ACPI spec" should be ok. 
I guess even non ACPI architectures will be able to live with that.
Anyways, since we seem to agree and so far nobody has complained
it's just that somebody needs to do a patch?  If possible make
it generic code in drivers/acpi/numa.c, there won't be anything architecture 
specific in this and it should work for x86-64 too.
