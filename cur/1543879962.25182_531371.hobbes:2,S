you are right we should be requiring parent and child are in the same
namespace.  This has been fixed.

This was a very course grain check that was done to restrict access to
sysctl's that could be potentially used to elevated priledge.  The check
is inconsistent with AppArmor's model and we should be modelling
sysctl accesses as pathname access, and then we could be using standard
mediation.
