You are missing the CONFIG_HOTPLUG checks around the functions that add
and check the device ids from these sysfs files.  If CONFIG_HOTPLUG is
not enabled, those files do not do anything.
In 2.6.16, CONFIG_HOTPLUG is moving under CONFIG_EMBEDDED, so the odds
of people disabling it are going to be pretty small now.

Do you have a suggestion as to how to fix this?
