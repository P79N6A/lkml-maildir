I wasn't arguing that it is what should be happening - I was just
pointing out that there are worse things than that routinely happen in
distro bugzillas!
Also I feel that if maintainer refuse to fix something - that's a dead
end as far as that particular bug is considered. We can try and track
such bugs in different STATUS but there would have to be people
interested in digging through such bugs and willing to fix it after
the maintainer has given up. Which is possible but not likely.
