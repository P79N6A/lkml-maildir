I have to agree. I am not an audio programmer, just a user; but the
bottom line is simply: It is WAY to hard to get things working (if
at all possible).
At one point I tried to get sound from xmms and ut2004 at the same time
(on my new machine). I was ASTONISHED that it didn't Just-Work!
After trying many complex things-- I gave up and put my old
soundblaster Live! in the new PC - because that card has hardware
support for this. Now I was lucky to HAVE that other soundcard,
but what about all those other users out there who just buy a new
PC, with a sound chip on the motherboard and then, being simple, ordinairy
users, have to face this ALSA configuration hell to do something
as simple as having two audio applications play sound at the same time?

Worse-- the two fragment limit is passed on to the OSS emulation (or at least
it was in 2005; but if this is still true for the ALSA API in 2007, then my
guess is that it's also still true for the OSS emulation). The result is
that applications written for OSS do not work anymore when using the OSS
emulation of ALSA and therefore the argument of providing backwards
compatibility doesn't exist.

Good post, nenolod.

PS I am NOT saying that I want ALSA to be removed from the kernel.
   I am just saying that I agree with those who think that the
   ALSA API is too complex, hard to use and has serious flaws that
   should be addressed.
