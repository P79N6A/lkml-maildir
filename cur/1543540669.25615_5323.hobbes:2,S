   I tried to get two serial consoles through ttyS0 and ttyS1 from my linux
   box.
   It is impossible to get two serial consoles but I could get one serial
   console and one virtual console.
   How can I get two serial console?
   Is it impossible?
Unfortunately, having two serial consoles isn't supported at the moment.
Why would you want to do something like that?
