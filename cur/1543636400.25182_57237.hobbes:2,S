  i met some problem with linux2.4.19. i devided my disk to three partitions: hda1,hda2 and hda3.  hda3 is the swap. both hda1 and hda2 are ext3 file system. i boot the system with a initrd image which is saved on hda1.
  when i use linux-2.4.19-pre1 and pre2, the system worked well. but when i test linux-2.4.19-pre9,pre10,rc1 and rc2, the same problem happened to all these verions. the system boot up, but the filesystem is readonly.the following is what on the screen(not exactly):
..
mount root as readonly
INIT version is 2.78
swap on(swap priority -1)
..
  is there some bugs in linux-2.4.19 with the filesystem? or with the initrd boot? or i made some mistakes?
  please cc. thanks.
