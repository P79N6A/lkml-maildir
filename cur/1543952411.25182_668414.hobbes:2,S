I think splattering these things all over is probably a bad idea.
If you're going to do this, I think you need a couple of phases.  
1. update the vm_(un)acct_memory() functions to take an mm
2. start using them (or some other abstracted functions in place)
3. update the new functions for cgroups
It's a bit non-obvious why you do the mem_cgroup_update_as() calls in
the places that you do from context.
Having some other vm-abstracted functions will also keep you from
splattering mem_cgroup_update_as() across the tree.  That's a pretty bad
name. :)  ...update_mapped() or ...update_vm() might be a wee bit
better.
