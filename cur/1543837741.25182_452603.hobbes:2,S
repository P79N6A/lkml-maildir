Subject: [PATCH for review] [23/145] i386: Enable NMI watchdog by default
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've had good experiences with having this on by default on x86-64.
It turns nasty hangs into easier to debug oopses.
Enable the local APIC wdog by default for systems newer than 2004.
This comes from a strange compromise: according to arjan the reason
it was off by default was some old IBM systems that corrupted
registered when NMI happened in SMI. Can't remember more specific,
but >= 2004 should avoid these. It's probably overly broad
because most older systems should be ok (and the really old systems
won't be supported by the local apic watchdog anyways)
