I already mentioned my code and some details in my previous mail on
the list !!!! Can u check and help me out or I hav to send that again
???? And as far as Redhat Support concerns that problem is not related
to Redhat because I reserved memory by placing the code in the
arch/i386/mm/init.c file in one_highpage_init function not through
mem= option of the kernel ......
Waiting for your response and help .....
