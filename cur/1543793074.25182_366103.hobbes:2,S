And it's practically identical to the one that's been in my -tiny tree
for two years.
I agree with Alan's complaint that this should in fact be done with
dynamic allocation. However, when I last set out to do that, it
appeared to be an _extremely_ invasive change so I quickly abandoned
it.
Meanwhile, this is currently the largest static allocation in a
typical kernel. Something has to be done.
