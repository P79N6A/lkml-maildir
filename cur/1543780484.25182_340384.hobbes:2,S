You point out various reasons why the POSIX (draft-)specification is
problematic.  But nobody says Linux has to abide it, especially as it
is a mere withdrawn draft.  Solaris 10 has capabilities (except that
they're called "privileges") which are similar, but not identical, to
the POSIX ones.
And even capabilities with no filesystem support can be useful.  In
fact, as far as I see it, the main interest in capabilities lies in
the "process management" part.  For example, I might like to run this
or that binary, which claims it needs to be run as root, with a
limited set of capabilities: the current Linux kernels make this quite
impossible.  Conversely, I might wish to give a particular capability
to a given user; in association with sudo, this might be quite useful:
instead of telling sudo to let the user run a given command as root,
just let him run a capability-aware wrapper which drops every
capability except the required ones and then calls the actual program
- so even if the latter is not secure, damage is more limited.  I can
think of thousands of other uses not requiring any kind of filesystem
support.

Yes, the sendmail vulnerability proved this quite clearly.  So
certainly a luser should not be permitted to run a suid root program
with anything in between the empty set and the full set of
capabilities.

I might suggest encoding the presence of capabilities by a sgid bit
for a specific group (say, wheel) on top of the extended attributes.
So the careful sysadmin will notice the programs (because sgid wheel
is significant enough to be noted) but it will not cause total
disaster if mounted on a non-capability-capable ;-) filesystem.

Yes, this seems like a reason to deviate from the POSIX model under
Linux.
