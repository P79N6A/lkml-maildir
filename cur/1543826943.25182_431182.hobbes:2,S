That is a possibility. Also totally PPC specific for a problem that will
hit every arch once I start moving things around in the init code. I
still think that the best way is to fix the mutex code. You remember
what you can read on most public toilets about leaving them in the state
you found them ? Sounds like a pretty good rule to me here as well.
