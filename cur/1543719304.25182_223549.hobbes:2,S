Ok - but in the absence of futex(2), is it perhaps better to move this page
to futex(9)? Or merge it into futex(4)?

If it will provide one, I'll change the page to be in line with how futex(2)
will probably work, with errno etc.
Regarding the verbiage, I need input about the use of the word 'process', as
I'm not sure if there is a generic word covering both processes and threads.
Jamie suggests 'tasks', but that is kernel lingo and of little use for
userspace developers. Suggestions?
Thanks.
