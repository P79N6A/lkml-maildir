That's why they exmaples should not be hidden/embedded in .txt files;
they should be standalone .c files with makefiles etc.
I've built and corrected several of them, but they would be more
likely to be kept up-to-date if they are more available in standalone
files.
and they can be taken out of Documentation/ whenever they go into
util-linux-ng or elsewhere.  Let's get the order correct.
