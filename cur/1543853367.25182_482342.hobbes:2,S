What ever happened to the patch proposed last year in this thread:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0512.3/0050.html
It doesn't appear to have been merged into the kernel.  Was it forgotten 
about?  This seems to be a rather important change given the current 
brokenness with removable media.  Users expect to be able to unplug 
their usb memory stick after they save their documents and exit the 
application.  They can not do this without corruption due to aggressive 
caching, and the sync mount option causes far too many writes, killing 
performance and in some cases, destroying media by prematurely wearing 
out the fat sectors.
Can we get this patch revived?
