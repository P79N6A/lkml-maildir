I have my own pet project for porting to SH3. :-) It's just kernel
port, so you may not have much interest.  You know, major problem
is drivers for hardware.
So far, I prepared cross compiling environment for SH3 (GNU tool
chain), bought evaluation board for SH3 (made by Kyoto Micro
Computer), and ported GDB for that board, implement simple funcitons
such as str*.  Currently studying MMU of SH3.
If we can share any, it would be very good.
Interested?
