... and my point is that there is not much reason to introduce a
possible performance regression because of such a latency in an
artificial test case, especially when there are other sources of
unbound latency when dealing with large numbers of tasks (and on
uniprocessor too, eg. rwsem).
However, as an RT-tree thing obviously I have no problems with it,
but unless your interrupt thread is preemptible, then there isn't
much point because it can cause a similar latency (that your tools
won't detect) simply by running multiple times.
You really want isolcpus on SMP machines to really ensure load
balancing doesn't harm RT behaviour, yeah?
