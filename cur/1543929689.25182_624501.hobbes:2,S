  A minor typo:

> Avoiding unaligned accesses
> ===========================
> 
> The easiest way to avoid unaligned access is to use the get_unaligned() and
> put_unaligned() macros provided by the <asm/unaligned.h> header file.
> 
> Going back to an earlier example of code that potentially causes unaligned
> access:
> 
> 	void myfunc(u8 *data, u32 value)
> 	{
> 		[...]
> 		*((u32 *) data) = cpu_to_le32(value);
> 		[...]
> 	}
> 
> To avoid the unaligned memory access, you would rewrite it as follows:
> 
> 	void myfunc(u8 *data, u32 value)
> 	{
> 		[...]
> 		value = cpu_to_le32(value);
> 		put_unaligned(value, data);
> 		[...]
> 	}
> 
> The get_unaligned() macro works similarly. Assuming 'data' is a pointer to
> memory and you wish to avoid unaligned access, its usage is as follows:
> 
> 	u32 value = get_unaligned(data);
> 
> These macros work work for memory accesses of any length (not just 32 bits as
               ^^^^^^^^^
remove one of them :)
