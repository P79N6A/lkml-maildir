I see. But why not just call it "module", like we do in all other
places, when it points to /sys/module/.
To find dependent modules, you would walk up the chain of parents, and
include everything that is found by looking for "driver/module" and
"module" links?
Wouldn't that make it completely generic, without any virtio specific hacks?
