Me personally, I really like the Ensoniq AudioPCI / AudioPCI 97 /
Creative SoundBlaster PCI, which are all basically the same card.
They are pci (duh), supported by both ALSA and OSS, but not OSS Lite.
They have 2 DSPs, one that does playback/record @ 16bit48k, one that
does playback at 16bit48k. Nice mixer, four internal inputs(!!), one for
CD audio, one for a radio card, and two auxillary inputs.
However, it does not have a FM synth chip, ala Yamaha OPL2/3. So no
cheezy muzak in DOOM. It does do wavetable, but I have not looked into
using it, as I don't care too much. If I wan music with DOOM, I'll play
some Pantera or something.
I have experienced some skipping while under high load, and I have not
played with the dmabuf settings. I've had audio skips under high load
since the dawn of time, and always assumed it was because my CPU wasn't
fast enough; oh well, you live and learn.
Maybe some kind soul out there knows if the dmabuf option is settable
from a LILO boot prompt / /etc/lilo.conf file...
