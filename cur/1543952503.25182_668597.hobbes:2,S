Probably the same one I saw, from that URL.

True, and bothersome.  All VIA would have to do is adopt a design
and production methodology different than they've used for many
years now, and this problem wouldn't appear.  ;)

I'd take that.  Thing is, someone sent me a vt8235 datasheet
which explicitly says "do not write that register", which
makes the ">= 0x60" test a lose.

They could try the "setpci" thing you used ... but even if
that works, I'd really want to avoid writing into registers
where the docs say "do not write".  Unless VIA comes out and
says "just kidding!" ... :)

OK, I'll leave this in my mailbox for a few days waiting more
testing results, and if nothing goes wrong I'll send it along
for a post-2.6.25 merge.
Thanks!
