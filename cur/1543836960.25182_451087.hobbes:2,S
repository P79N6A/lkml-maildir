Umm, that's already been done?
include/asm-i386/unwind.h::arch_unw_user_mode():
        return info->regs.eip < PAGE_OFFSET
               || (info->regs.eip >= __fix_to_virt(FIX_VDSO)
                    && info->regs.eip < __fix_to_virt(FIX_VDSO) + PAGE_SIZE)
               || info->regs.esp < PAGE_OFFSET;
Could this be the problem?
|ENTRY(sysenter_entry)

|sysenter_past_esp:
What does that do?  .cfi_register is not documented anywhere, not
even in the gnu.org online documentation for gas.  (I spent 10
minutes googling and found nothing other than the changeset that
added it to gas.)
