BSD folks did it after *big* pains and it wasn't harmless. Needed - yes,
but just remember the fun we had with readdir() and friends. And that was
ten years later. In the beginning it was horrible. Yes, it was needed. But
adding new features at every whim is thoroughly rooten idea - if a year
later you'll see that it should be done in a different way you are deep in
it. In effect you'll have to remove it and add a new one. With all fun
associated with featurectomy. Just look what had it done to NT. New
features are *not* just fine when they modify the interface in any
direction. May I remind you that we are in foo.<even>.bar now?
	BTW, if the software is written for Linux *only* it has much
better chance to depend on a random boat anchor we'll try to remove/redo
ten releases later. It is not locked just on Linux. It's locked on
Linux foo.bar.baz--foo.bar.quux.

Ex-cu-se me? WTF do you mean - that *script* is on R/O fs? And you
cannot copy it away? Cool. And said R/O fs doesn't contain the things
needed? 99:1 that it will break. The path to interpreter will be the last
of your problems. Just for starters: fixed pathes in binaries. Fixed
pathes unconditionally assigned to shell variables within said script. And
that's aside of the general luserness of the software author that *will*
show in their code. If you have such stuff on R/O /usr - shoot the luser
who got root on the LAN or lusers who produced the distribution. It's
ridiculous.
