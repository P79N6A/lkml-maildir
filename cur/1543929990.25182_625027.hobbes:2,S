Yes, you are right, this unconditional spin_lock() is not good, especially for
exit_group/exec.
But please look at the next patch I am sending, it removes the pessimization
almost completely.
The only difference: when there is no group exit in progress, we are doing
	spin_lock_irq(siglock);
	if (!signal_pending()) {
		unlock and return
	}
while the current code does
	if (!signal_pending())
		return;
	spin_lock_irq(siglock);
	...
It would be nice to measure the difference, but I can't invent the test-case.
I tested (just in case) 100000 fork+exit 's
	perl -e 'fork ? wait : exit for 1 .. 100_000'
with and without the patch, and didn't notice any difference as expected.

Thanks for looking at this!
