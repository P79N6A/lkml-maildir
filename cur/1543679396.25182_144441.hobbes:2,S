Thanks for testing and working with me.
Please if others are testing and still having problems note this work is _not_ 
complete yet, but I do need to assess every incremental change to make sure 
it addresses the issue I am trying to fix at each step.
For what it's worth there are still at least 3 things I need to 
implement/change in this patch which induce problems still, so tell me of 
your experiences and I will try hard to accomodate.
