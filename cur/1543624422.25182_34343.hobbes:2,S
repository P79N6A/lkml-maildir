Oh good god, the nr_sectors/current_nr_sectors for the pio data phases
haven't been fixed _yet_?!
task_in_intr()
{
	...
	pBuf = rq->buffer + ((rq->nr_sectors - rq->current_nr_sectors) * SECTOR_SIZE);
}
And that's just one instance. Good luck running 2.4.19-pre3, this is
just so badly broken I can't find words to explain it (again). It's
really puzzling why this is still broken. I fixed it in 2.5 when the
merge happened there, the issue has been known for at least that long. I
can only recommend that no one uses 2.4.19-pre3!
Marcelo, at least apply the noop patch here. If I get motivated I'll fix
the interrupt handlers as well, can't say I really want to though...
