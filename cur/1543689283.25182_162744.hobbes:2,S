I don't want to get in the middle of this, but having a laptop decide
that it doesn't have enough battery to finish a boot is something which
happens now and again. If this change could cause data corruption where
the old code didn't, perhaps we could stand the overhead of moving the
enable to the end of the boot, or wherever would be safe.
