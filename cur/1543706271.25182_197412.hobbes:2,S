[PATCH] I2C: Update I2C maintainers entry
I propose the following update of the "I2C AND SENSORS DRIVERS" entry in
MAINTAINERS:
* Remove Frodo Looijaard. He isn't active in the project anymore, and
forwards everythings he receives to the mailing-list. More work for
everyone, and increased latency.
* Move your name to the top. This is more realistic since you are the
real maintainer of the i2c subsystem in 2.6.
* Reindent. Spaces were used instead of tabs.
