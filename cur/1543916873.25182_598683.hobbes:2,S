Hi,
After upgrading to 2.6.23-rc7 for testing purposes I noticed that the  
contents of /proc/bus/input/devices changed a little bit.
I now have the following entries for my USB-keyboard
....
P: Phys=usb-0000:00:1d.0-2/input0
S: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.0/input/input2
....
with kernel < 2.6.23 I saw
....
P: Phys=/input0
S: Sysfs=/class/input/input0
....
I this a "wanted" change or should I still see the same with 2.6.23?
Kind regards,
Michael
