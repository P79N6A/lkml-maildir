There is a newer driver "bttv-0.5.22.tar.gz"
at 
http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/~rjkm/linux/bttv.html
But don't use -DVIDEODAT in the Makefile. That results in such messages.
I have had the same problems. Unfortunately videotext now doesn't
work for me :-(
Alan Cox has updated the bttv driver in
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.2pre/patch-2.2.0pre7ac2.bz2
I don't know which version is newer/better. Not tested yet.
