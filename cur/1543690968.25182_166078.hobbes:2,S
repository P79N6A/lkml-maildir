Hi Zwane,
I still don't mind Adrian's patch (at least the concept). Its true, the
Athlon workaround is insignificant, but Adrian's patch allows the
possibility of compiling things like it out. Its also clearer to me than
the current scheme.
The only objections I have seen are from those who don't understand what
it does or implmentation issues. It might be the case that it can't be
done "nicely" without more support from kconfig and/or kbuild though.
