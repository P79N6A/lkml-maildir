What you say is true, but in the real world being able to work with the
most commonly used network hardware is a hard requirement. When
"conforms to RFC" colides with "works" there's an issue, particularly
when the RFC allows several behaviours (bad RFC!).
I would hope that it is possible to get a single flag to force all
packets out of a NIC configured with the source IP in the packet, I
don't feel the need to make that the default behaviour, just to find
some alternative to patches or source routing.
