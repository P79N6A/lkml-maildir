Please note that there is a reason why the "D" state exists, and it is 
because there are certain times when interrupting a process can have 
significant consequences on the integrity of the entire filesystem (or 
other global resource) and must not be allowed for consistency.  As it 
happens, most of the conditions which cause processes to get "stuck" in 
disk-wait state (usually because of hardware issues) happen to be 
exactly the places where it's most difficult to work around this (at 
least for physically-backed filesystems, less so for NFS et al).
This, I assume, is at least part of the reason why Alan Says:

...doesn't do anything for non-NFS filesystems, though.  There isn't 
even a hook for it in any of the other FS drivers.

(for NFS) does work most of the time.  I'm not quite sure why, but in 
some cases I've needed to combine this with mounting things 'intr' so I 
could manually kill processes off.

Well, yes and no.  It's not _CPU_ load, but the stuck processes can 
consume other limited resources (memory, file descriptors, etc) to the 
point that the system is unable to function properly if enough of them 
accumulate.  I have also had this happen.
