To print out for each type and order, I'll need the type_names[] array
from 007_stats but I don't see it as a problem.
The problem is that by putting all the changes to this function in another
patch, the kernel will not build after applying 003_fragcore. I am
assuming that is bad. I think it makes sense to leave this patch as it is,
but have a 004_showfree patch that adds the type_names[] array and a more
detailed printout in show_free_areas. The remaining patches get bumped up
a number.
Would you be happy with that?
