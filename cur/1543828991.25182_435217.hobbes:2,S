What creates a fair amount of the heat in a CPU is the period of time
when the transistors switch from nearly zero resistance to infinite
resistance.  That brief period where the resistance very high but not
yet infinite generates heat.  That's why running a CPU at a higher clock
speed generates more heat:  there are more of those high resistance
transitions in a given period of time.
I think every processor since at least 1998 or so has had a mode where
executing the HLT instruction puts the bulk of the chip in a steady
state.  When it's in that steady state, the transistors don't switch, so
there are no high resistance periods.
This is, of course, completely different than the sleep or reduced clock
modes that modern processors support.
