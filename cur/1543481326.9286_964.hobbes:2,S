Hi,
This points to a potential problem when a low-level SCSI driver calls
scsi_done() with DID_ERROR return code from within the queue() function.
And in addition, as I commented several times, ignoring multiple
luns in ide-scsi:
-	Breaks multi-lun ATAPI devices such as PD-CD drives.
-	Is incorrect in the first place and just hides the
	problem -- the bug which causes the oops with the HP 8100
	is most likely deep in the 2.1.x SCSI subsystem error
	recovery code for host adapters which don't queue a
	SCSI request sense command themself rather than in the
	ide-scsi low level driver code, as the problem doesn't
	seem to occur with 2.0.x. It is harder to find and fix, but it
	is the direction we should be aiming at; fixing problems at
	their source, not hiding them under an incorrect fix, as they
	will likely surface up in another variant in the future.
