Yah, I agree.  I looked into doing this awhile back, when I noticed
inotify did not generate events for /proc.  We just need to add calls to
the fsnotify hooks to the proc_create() and proc_delete_foo() stuff.
The interfaces are capable, e.g. we can add support at anytime, even
after inotify is merged.  I'd be for it.
