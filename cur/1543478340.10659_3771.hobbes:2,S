I'm triying to understand the way memory is managed under Linux.
I cannot understand why we need to "reserve" 0xC0000000-0xFFFFFFFF
of virtual memory for physical memory.
Why do we need to map entire physical memory to part of virtual 
memory ?
We should be able to map part of 4Go physical memory space to
where we want in virtual memory, by pages of 4kb,
And each process should be able to have 4Go virtual memory
Up to the kernel to do that.
Dont understand why we cut virtual memory in two parts: one usable 
and one equal to "fixed" 1Go physical memory "pseudo limit"
