I just found another set of messages in the logs as well:
CPU 1: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
Bank 1: b200000000000115
Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt

How do you work out what the numbers mean? Is there some kind of reference
to it, or are you just Alan "decodes machine check exceptions in his head"
Cox :) From the code it seems to be some kind of MCG status and MC0 status
- but of course, I have no idea what that means...

After checking the logs (above) I found that the two times this has
happened it has managed to write it to the logs. Is the fact that it
sync()d a good indication that it will manage to reboot OK?
Thanks,
