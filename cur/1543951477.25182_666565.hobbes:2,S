I named two different sets of constraints.  One from the power
management chips themselves.  And a board-specific subset of those;
which just limits the power supply capabilities that drivers could
access.  In a way, each constraint defines a subsidiary domain...

OK -- that's the right model.  Drivers are generic, and board
specific stuff is localized in board.c files.

Now you're introducing a third party, adding its own constraints.
In this case:  something that must be a subset of the constraints
you've defined already.

If the only way to add constraints is to add new layers, I think
there will be some undesirable API growth patterns.  :)
This is handled in the clock framework just as part of the clock
tree.  Drivers mostly deal only with leaves and a few branches.
Platform and board code deals with the rest:  this board has
these crystals, these PLLs are configured as follows, divisors
set like this, maybe autogated in hardware, etc.
I'd think that a power domain tree would be a natural model to
use here, and it would avoid those API growth troubles...

Right.

That may of course require the drivers to know which voltage
has been chosen, and to be able to rule out some voltages.
I think changing voltages will be uncommon outside of board
specific setup code, at least for now.  Hardware designers
aren't currently expecting software to be able to dynamically
adjust voltage, for power saving or whatever.  Except for
DVFS stuff like cpufreq, which is awkward since among other
things it's got to coordinate clock and power domain changes.
But we already have one example in-kernel of a simple driver
framework which supports switching just voltages at run-time...
That's the MMC framework.  As a rule all MMC/SD cards can
work at 3/3.3V, plus or minus a few decivolts.  But there's
been a push to get "dual voltage" cards out there, which can
also operate at 1.8V (plus or minus, in a smaller range).
See <include/mmc/mmc_host.h> for the MMC_VDD bitmasks; the
architecture allows ranges that aren't yet widely used by
current boards and cards.

If a board supports two MMC slots, it could easily end up
having a "high" voltage card and a dual voltage card inserted
at the same time, sharing the same regulator.  That may mean
the low voltage range is temporarily not allowable.  It's
an issue of "can it work", not "will it be damaged".

They want an on/off switch, basically.  Though I think there
are variants of this, notably:
 - Some drivers don't really need to know if power goes off.
   They can share a power domain, and are content with a
   refcount model:  turn it off when no users are active.
 - Other drivers may care that it's actually off; maybe the
   only reset mechanism they have is a power-up reset, or
   they need to power down a saw to change its blade.
Some of that will be supported by the hardware designs.  But
when it's not, I think a "power it down NOW!" primitive may
be needed.  Folk managing industrial controls will probably
need extra features -- it takes time for the voltage/current
to stop, the saw blade has momentum, etc -- but minimally it
seems to me there should be a "disable-and-wait" variant for
drivers in that second category.

Some LCD contrast controls run by voltage too.
USB has fairly limited current control requirements; in
practice they matter more on the peripheral side, where
the host supplies a certain amount of current (at nominal
5V), which is a system *input* ...
I hesitate to call this second class of driver "power aware".
The driver has a control knob it uses, and it doesn't know
what goes on when it turns that knob.  MMC and USB are to
some extent truly power aware:  labels on those knobs read
Volts (MMC) and current (MMC, nyet supported; and USB).
Even CPUfreq just uses presets for its DVFS settings.

To the extent that's true, I suspect it's because hardware
designers have been told software won't manage power budgets.
On the other hand, I can easily imagine wanting to do something
like have a 150 mA regulator power a couple MMC slots, instead
of a 300 mA one, and just require that software not kick in
high power read/writes in both slots at the same time.  That's
just a simple current budgeting issue, which may not matter until
someone puts two high speed/power cards in at once...

I think that conclusion doesn't quite follow from what you've
said so far.  But I'm not sure it matters, at least for what
I've needed to do.

It's a bit clearer, but you're introducing a new term
"power domain", and your understanding of that notion
doesn't quite match what I've seen.  It may be a lot
simpler to represent the hierarchy of power domains,
not unlike how the hierarchy of clock domains.

That's what device.platform_data should be used for.  It's not
a case of drivers hard-wiring board-specific data; they should
get told such stuff the same way other drivers get told.
Remember that board init code probably can't do anything with
that resistor config; knowledge of how to do that shuld be part
of a driver that hasn't yet initialized.

I chose my MMC example with care.  :)
And in that case, it's very realistic to want to put a slot
into either a 3V3 or 1V8 regulation mode.  It's also realistic
to have slots share a parent power domain (and thus a current
budget), even if they have individual FETs for power on/off.
The stretch is small:  that both situations are combined.

Maybe the notifier should be per-domain, with veto capability.
That would address the issues I noted.  Though it should be a
bit simpler to just have the clients register callbacks if
they care; notifiers are an idiom that mostly bothers me.

I'm not sure I see the point in *not* expecting the
regulator to turn itself off when set to 0V ... but
that's not a very big issue.

That make sense to me.  More so than needing to worry about
whether 3.1V will pass as 3.0V on a given system...

Agreed.  In particular, please consider the notion of a tree
of power domains, as a way to cleanly structure all the various
interdependencies.
