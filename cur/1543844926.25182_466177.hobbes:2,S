Interesting.  You're probably right.  Thanks.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but I'm still curious about my original
question (which I don't believe has been answered).  To be honest, I
wasn't asking whether it was possible to configure Linux or SELinux in
a way that blocks this "attack"; I was more interested in whether this
"attack" will succeed against a stock Linux system.  If you have any
thoughts on that question, I'd be interested to hear them.  I notice that
the original poster has raised essentially this point more than once,
too, but never got any response, either.
