  Hello,
  please try to post mails with lines shorter than 75 characters. It
easier to read them... Now to your problem:

  This is stange. Linux frees the buffers automatically under memory
pressure (and you seem to really get under pressure when kernel starts
killing processes) unless they are pinned in memory - e.g. someone holds
a reference to them.

  You have to always have a buffer on which ll_rw_block/getblk works.
However nothing prevents you from creating your private buffer head and
freeing it when you are done with everything. But you really should not
need it. There is a bug somewhere else which prevents kernel from really
freeing those buffers.
  Note that buffers are used just to make access to data in pagecache
easier (and doing IO with them) - each buffer is bound to some page in
pagecache (either a device cache or mapping of data of an inode). So
maybe you are doing something bad so that those pages cannot be freed...
