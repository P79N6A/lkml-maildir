You are getting fragments and holes mixed up. A file with holes is one
that pretends to be much bigger then it actualy is (By not actualy
storing large chunks of zeros).
Linux has no problems with 128Mb swapfiles on ext2fs. I'm currently
running a production server with 1.5Gb of swap spread over 12 such
swapfiles with no problems whatsoever. (Although I look forward to 2.2
and large-swap support for a single 2Gb swap-partition :)
