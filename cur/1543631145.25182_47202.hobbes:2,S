Under 2.5.17 there is a problem with gtop 1.0.9.  It opens a window but never
fills in any details; there's just a blank background.  The process becomes
unkillable, even with -9, and although I can do a normal shutdown, the root
partition can't be unmounted because the gtop process is still running and so
fsck is forced on reboot.  There are no oops messages that I can find in any of
the logs.
Actually, this happens with all the most recent 2.5.x kernels.  I'm not sure how
far back it goes, but I believe it was working OK prior to 2.5.8.  (If necessary
I can try to narrow it down further.)  It still works great with 2.4.19-pre8 and
2.4.19-pre8-ac5.
