If that is the only reason there is no need for further
discussion on this thread.  The idea of adding /dev/frandom
is i think clearly rejected.  Frandom as replacement for
urandom is a future possibility.
The frandom author or someone else who cares enough can code
a patch that provides does do a drop-in replacement for
urandom.  Preferably that patch could have a build option to
chose which PRNG to use.  People that care can try the
patch.  Everyone else can ignore it.
In the mean time the cryptogeeks can analise it, bang on it,
sprinkle it with pixie dust, or whatever until there is
enough confidence or its weaknesses are known.
If after these things are done, months from now, it can be
considered a candidate, or not, for inclusion in some of the
speciality, distribution or development trees.
