What do you mean you have removed the ability to make system calls 
directly?  That makes no sense.  Glibc has to be able to make system 
calls so you can write your own code that does the same thing if you want.
For the OP: you might want to study the glibc sources to see how it 
implements syscall, and mimic that.  IIRC it involves making an int 80 
call on i386.
