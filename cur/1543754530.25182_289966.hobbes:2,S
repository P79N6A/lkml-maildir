Hi,
I work for 3M Touch Systems (former MicroTouch) as software engineer and
our main product is touchscreen as input device.
Recently, we have released hid compliant devices (they work perfectly under
Windows OS), but Linux hid driver does not support us correctly. In kernel
2.4 hid driver recognizes our devices and tries to interpret events in best
manner, but since we are absolute pointing device it was a bit tricky with
hid mouse on same system. I kernel 2.6 hid core driver grubs our devices
but does not recognize us as hid device. So we decided, for now, to disable
hid driver of recognizing our hid devices.
My question is how can we submit changes to kernel tree.
Here is example of patch for kernel 2.6.10 hid-core.c:
