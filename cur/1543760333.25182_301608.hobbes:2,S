I can. You are using a 2.6.10 kernel at best (that's what FC3 updates
have), and the bug is triggered by changes made to the i2c-algo-bit
driver somewhere between 2.6.10 and 2.6.11. So it's not surprising that
you don't see any problem. Note that the version of the media/video
drivers you use is not relevant here. The bug has been there for over a
year, but the code path where it lies was never taken until i2c-algo-bit
was updated recently. What matters is the version of i2c-algo-bit.
So as long as you don't move to a 2.6.11 kernel, don't even bother
trying my patches, because you will never hit the code that I am trying
to fix.
Thanks,
