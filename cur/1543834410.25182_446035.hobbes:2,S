This doesn't seem that big of an issue for people to be up in arms about.  You 
wouldn't have to stop /everything/, would you, just have an in kernel mutex 
in vfs_mkdir.  It's not the most commonly used system call in the book -- 
meaning serializing the checking/creating of new directories would not really 
hamper your system /that/ much.
Personally, I don't think hard linked directories are necessary or even that 
interesting, but they certainly aren't impossible to do.  I suppose there 
might be some specialty filesystem that might like to do hardlinked 
directories and I don't think the vfs core should make it difficult.
