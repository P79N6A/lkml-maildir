True enough. I'm rather wondering though why RHEL is shipping with it if 
it's a _real_ problem. Scribbling junk all over kernel memory would be the 
kind of thing I'd imagine you'd mightely piss-off enterprise customers with. 
But well, sure, that rather quickly becomes a self-referential argument I guess.

I personally believe that CONFIG_4KSTACKS is not better only for very few 
users but well, no, if even some users exist, then I wouldn't want to 
suggest they'd be disallowed (shared or unshared) 8K stacks.
I _would_ in fact suggest there are few enough left that rather than 4K, 8K 
should really be the option that only those few would select, but ofcourse, 
given config defaults that's mostly a matter of semantics, so who cares in 
the end.

Well, no. "oldconfig" works fine, and other than that, all failure modes 
I've heard about also in this thread are MD/LVM/XFS. This is extremely 
widely tested stuff in at least Fedora and RHEL. "hard to debug" is simply 
not the case -- every one will immediately start yelling 4KSTACKS when that 
software-stack appears anywhere.
Don't try and hang this off generic development unease... ;-)
Rene.
