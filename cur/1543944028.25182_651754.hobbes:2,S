Having such notification handled by glibc to free up unused malloc (or
any heap allocations) would be very useful, because even if a program
does "free" there is no guarantee the memory is returned to the kernel.
I think that having a generic reservation framework is too complex, but
hiding the details of /dev/mem_notify from applications is desirable.
A simple wrapper (possibly part of glibc) to return the poll fd, or set
up the signal is enough.
