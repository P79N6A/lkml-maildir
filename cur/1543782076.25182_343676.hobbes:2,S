Subject: [PATCH] hiddev: output reports are dropped when HIDIOCSREPORT is called in short succession

Hi,
when trying to make the hiddev driver issue several Set_Report control
transfers to a custom device with 2.6.13-rc6, only the first transfer in
a row is carried out, while others immediately following it are silently
dropped.
This happens where hid_submit_report() (in hid-core.c) tests for
HID_CTRL_RUNNING, which seems to be still set because the first transfer
is not finished yet.
As a workaround, inserting a delay between the two calls to
ioctl(HIDIOCSREPORT) in userspace "solves" the problem.
The straightforward fix is to add a call to hid_wait_io() to the
implementation of HIDIOCSREPORT (in hiddev.c), just like for
HIDIOCGREPORT. Works fine for me.
Apparently, this issue has some history:
