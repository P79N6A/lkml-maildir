I'm sure I missed some redefinition,
but lately I noticed that the BogoMIPS count 
for my PowerMac has dropped rather significantly.
My logs still show kernel 2.4.0-test6 at 166.30 BogoMIPS ---
and now there are only 14.23 left! (since -test7)
CPU showing signs of age?
Should I invest in a new computer?
By the way, has someone tested Linux on Apple's cube? ;-)
