Hey
I am writing a device driver for a data acquisition card and I cant find a
definative text on pci memory transfers. the card transfers one of two
blocks, 128k in size to the host on each transfer. What i am unsure about is
the memory allocation.
cardptr->busaddr = __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL,6);
6 being for the two blocks of 128k.
is this the way to do it for the 2.2 kernel?
any help would be greatly appreciated.
