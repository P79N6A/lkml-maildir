I was using 4.2.1.1 from debian.  I just upgraded to 4.3.0 that's in debian
experimental and is now working.  I really don't know what's changed between
versions, but I can't understand why just changing the system board would
have caused this.  All I know is the fact that the old board used the
generic intel setup routines and this one uses 7505 (but I also changed it).
I guess the only thing is this board is too new for X to understand or
something.
I'd like to upgrade my video card, but I don't know what to get.  I've
looked at what 3D is supported by the kernel and looks like I'll be going
for an ATI card.  Any recommendations or a list of ati radeon cards that
work in 3D?
