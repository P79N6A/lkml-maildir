I do not object to the driver (with byte order fixed), although it seems
written oddly... E.g. lots of trivial comments, the open count locked
by wrong lock. But I do not want to hold the 2.4 version hostage to
errors of the mainline. We should've caught them when we merged adutux
into Greg's tree. I have to admit I'm skipping reviewing a lot of 2.6.
