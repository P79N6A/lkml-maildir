Finally got it to work!
There must be a bug causing the Promise card / driver not to be fired up
(i'm using ab ASUS P2B motheroard). If I issue the "acpi=off" to the kernel
at boot it detects the card and fires up the driver. Everything seems to
work now. Who should I post this bug to so it can be fixed in coming
releases?

Not sure what else to try. I see that you've already posted to the ata-raid
list, so I'd hope that somebody else would reply from there. The pdcraid
driver has not received much attention lately, so it may very well be broken
for your configuration. Promise has released a binary/source combo driver
similar to Nvidia's that will still work in 2.4 - you might give that a try.
I have a
PDC20276 based onboard raid setup, however, I use 2.6 with device mapper to
use it. It's a bit of a pain to setup ATM - especially if you want to boot
from it, but it can be done. Good luck,
-Walt
