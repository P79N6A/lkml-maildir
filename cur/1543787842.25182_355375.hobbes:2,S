From what I see, because of its *layering* position
JB's "transport attributes" cannot satisfy open transport.
The reason is that MPT-based drivers indeed do need host template
in the LLDD.
Open Transport (SBP/USB/SAS) do not, since the chip is only
an interface to the transport.
The host template is implemented by a transport layer,
say USB Storage or the SAS Transport Layer.
This allows you to do great things, like layer
intersection.
