It does today.  We are talking about "you promise that this will be the
case ever after or we'll cut your head off".  I have no idea why you're
so reluctant since you don't have to maintain any of the user-level
bits.  And it is not you who has to deal with the fallout of a change
when it happens.
If epoll is so different from poll (and this is what I've been told frmo
Davide) then there should be a clear separation of the interfaces and
all those arguing to unify the data types and constants better should
rethink there understanding.
