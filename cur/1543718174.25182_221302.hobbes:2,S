hello friends,
          can anybody knows where does this
skb->dst->output(skb) call goes? it is written in
output_maybe_reroute function call in ip_output.c?
also let me know whether following two calls also
point to same destination funcaion as above function?
   hh->hh_output(skb);
   return dst->neighbour->output(skb);
if yes to which function they point (dev_queue_xmit)?
Thanking you.
