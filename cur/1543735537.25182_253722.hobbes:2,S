The design doesn't force DDC to be in the kernel or user space. You
can do it in either place.
In the driver I'm working on I use a standard in kernel i2c driver and
the i2c eeprom driver. This makes the EDID appear as a block in sysfs.
I've also take the monitor detection code from radeonfb and made it
into an IOCTL that the user space app calls.
The radeon driver has that extra code for intializing older DDC. That
can be handled generically in the I2C layer by writing a ddc driver
that is a superset of the eeprom driver.  I'd rather get that code
into a generic driver than repeat it in every video card driver.
