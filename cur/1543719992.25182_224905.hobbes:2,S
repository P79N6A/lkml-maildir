I've since then contacted Siemens on this issue, they tell me that with Sata 
Standard, the bios makes up the entire IDE system of what you select: 2 sata 
ports, or 2 sata + 2 pata ports. It can't support more than 4 ports and still 
boot from it.
If you want them all, first upgrade the bios to the latest version and put it 
on "OS Only".
Both work as a charm now.
Thanks anyway ;-)
