Sorry, that's incorrect.  I stated why earlier in this thread and akpm signed 
off on it.  With preempt you get ASAP (i.e., as soon as the outermost 
spinlock is done) process scheduling.  With hand-coded scheduling points you 
get 'as soon as it happens to hit a scheduling point'.
That is not the only benefit, just the most obvious one.
