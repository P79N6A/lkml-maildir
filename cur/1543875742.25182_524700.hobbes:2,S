Ugh.. does that mean we'll have 'regression reports' as in 'it worked
ok in -rc5, broken in final?
Well, suspend is currently so broken that we'll be flooded by reports,
anyway, but.... could we get at least define in code so that we can
tell users to flip it?
Or maybe it is enough to make libata dependend on EXPERIMETAL?
...making it dependend on BROKEN should be definitely enough...
