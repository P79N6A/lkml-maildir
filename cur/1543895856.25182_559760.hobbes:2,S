The idea was that if you did an ls you would get the latest version of
the file without the :revision_num. The only visible version would be
the latest version, i.e. the current system would not change. The idea
was that it would only show earlier versions if they were specifically
requested with a :revision_num suffix. In that case the
filesystem/kernel would need to recognise the suffix and return the
earlier version of the file.
The only userspace it would break is files with :num in their name, as I
haven't seen any files like that I don't think its too big a problem but
the way of specifiying revisions could be changed.
