This won't work. No sensible numbers would be there.

You cannot. statfs(2) only exports "Total number of inodes on disk" and
"number of free inodes on disk" values for fs. df substracts one from another one
to get "number of inodes in use".
Actually we export necessary numbers through sysfs for now. And we have patch
in our tree that just sets statfs(2) inode stuff to zero. You should see it after
next snapshot is released.
