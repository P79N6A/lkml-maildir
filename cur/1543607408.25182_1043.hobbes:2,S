I just tried 2.4.7, and while the module loads, the ac97_codec gives an 
"unknown id" response, and I get no sound out of the device whatsoever. Any 
writes to /dev/dsp just hang (not the kernel) and I get nothing out of the 
device.
I might try compiling the 2.4.7 trident module without symbol versions, and 
a 2.4.9 kernel the same, and try forcibly inmod'ing the 2.4.7 trident 
module on 2.4.9 and see what happens.
