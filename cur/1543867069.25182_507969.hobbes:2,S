Yes, thanks.  First version was do-while, latter was inline.
Here's an updated patch/description.

setcc() in math-emu is written as a gcc extension statement expression
macro that returns a value.  However, it's not used that way and it's
not needed like that, so just make it an inline void so that
we don't use an extension when it's not needed.
