We have observed mainly two kind of problems.
1. Devices A and B are sharing the same irq line. Driver for device A is
   initializing and opens the respective irq line(request_irq()). 
   Device B raises an interrupt. Interrupt handler for device A denies its 
   not my irq and there is no interrupt handler for device B yet. Device B   
   keeps the irq line asserted and kernel sees a flood of interrupts and
   finally kernel disables the irq line. Now device A's interrupt also stop
   coming and driver initialization for device A fails.
   We have observed this especially in case of aic7xxx driver and one sample
   log is attached with the mail.
2. Second problem is that driver is not expecting an interrupt the moment it
   calls request_irq(). Otherwise initialization fails. We saw this problem in
   IPS driver initialization failure. (Bugme 4573). Though this seenms to be 
   more of a driver bug and can be fixed separately.

True that drivers will not get interrupts until they register request_irq().
In the above mentioned aic7xxx dirver failure, this driver starts getting 
interrupts the moment it calls request_irq(). And the fact is that these
interrupts are being generated from some other sharing the same irq line.

It can very well be a big concern when it comes to booting normal kernel but
I believe that for capture kernel (kernel booting after a crash), it might
not be that big an issue. Anyway, capture kernel is booting only to capture
and save the dump to some pre configured storage media. Most probably it 
will be done from an initrd or an init script and system will boot into
production kernel back enabling all the consoles. 
Alternatively, pci device id of console can be passed to capture kernel
through command line and disabling interrupts can be skipped on console.
This is little hackish though but crash dump is a peculiar case.
Thanks
