Actually a blanket statement like that is just wrong. Moving a
network interrupt yes is probably quite expensive, but it is
about the worst case one to move. What's more, moving tasks between
NUMA nodes could easily be many orders of magnitude worse than the
transient slowdown of moving irqs.
Furthermore, what you say doesn't really seem to be an argument
for doing it in userspace or an argument against moving IRQs. It
actually shows that there are complex, hardware and kernel
implementation dependent issues, all of which suggest it is better
to be in kernel.

No I'm not misunderstanding or think it is a mistake. But it is
something which the kernel and the devices themselves should have
better knowledge of. You have a process which is reading off disk
and sending to a network interface? You may well want to put the
process and the disk interrupt and the network interrupt all on
the same CPU.

To reiterate, I do not think that IRQs should be moved more frequently.
I think the kernel is in the position to know far better than userspace
about irq balancing.

ie. simpler. All the topology stuff would be far simpler.

I'd rather not to this far into handwaving. I'm not saying that
I know exactly how it should work right now. I'm questioning the
established viewpoint that irq balancing belongs in userspace.
For that matter, I guess from the results you get, it's not terribly
bad to do in userspace or anything. But I think it can be done in
kernel.
Policy... I think that's a misused argument. The "policy" of any
kernel code I write is to utilise the hardware as efficiently as
possible within restrictions (eg. fairness, permissions). Setting
those restrictions is the realm of userspace, otherwise IMO it is
fine to go in kernel.
Using the same argument, task balancing and even scheduling is
policy, so is page reclaim, page writeback, filesystem block
allocation, etc. Now many of those things can be directed or
restricted somehow from userspace, and in-kernel irq balancing
would be no different.

It would be a couple of K, right? I mean it would be probably less than
half the code of irqbalance because of the parsing and topology stuff.
Also, I don't think the one-shot behaviour on single socket machines is
good policy at all, and it can't capture dynamic behaviour at all.

Ahh, hate to get off topic, but let's not perpetuate this myth.
It wasn't Con, or CFS, or anything that showed fairness is some
great new idea. Actually I was arguing for fairness first,
against both Con and Ingo, way back when the old scheduler was
having so much problems.
Not that I am trying to claim the idea for myself. Fairness is
like the most fundamental and obvious behaviour for any sort of
resource scheduler that I have to laugh when people get "credited"
with this idea.
Back on topic... no, fairness is not the only real policy. Not at
all. Fariness is one of the most important ones, and that is exactly
why it is the default behaviour. After that, deviation from that is
a userspace thing.

I don't think it is inappropriate. Obviously it needs to check it
to do something close to the right thing. This to me is yet another
signal that says the kernel is the right place for it.
Anyway, I'm clearly not going to change your mind. But I do have an
idea of the rationale for doing it in userspace now. So if I wanted
to challenge that, I guess I'd have to write code and prove it...
