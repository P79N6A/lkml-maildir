You might want to have a look at this:
   
http://archi.snu.ac.kr/jhkim/seminar/96-004.ps
   (lrfu algorithm)
To tell the truth, I don't really see why the frequency information is all
that useful either.  Rik suggested it's good for streaming IO but we already 
have effective means of dealing with that that don't rely on any frequency 
information.
So the list of reasons why aging is good is looking really short.
