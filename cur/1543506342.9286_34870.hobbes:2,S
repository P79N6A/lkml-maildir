As far as map_user_kiobuf() is concerned that is definitely a feature: I
want it to be able to encode user virtual addresses which might contain
non-page-struct pages (eg. video framebuffers).  That's why there are
separate struct page *[] and void *[] arrays in the kiobuf.
However, currently, trying to actually do a brw_kiovec on such pages
will do the Wrong Thing, due to the the __io_virt/__io_phys bitops.
This is closely tied into the whole business of bigmem support, btw ---
if we get IO to high addresses right then brw_kiovec will do the right
thing.
For now, I'll probably just add a flag to the kiobuf header indicating
whether any unmappable pages are present in the page list, and reject
such IOs in brw_kiovec.  However, I do actually have at least one user
currently relying on the existing behaviour in order to do IO direct
from frame buffers to disk.
