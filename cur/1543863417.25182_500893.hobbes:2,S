Hi Anton,
	Thanks for r your answer.
I tried vmalloc_to_page() and I have some question.
I print the "pages" in vm_struct structure of the buffer to compare the
address get from vmalloc_to_page(), result as follows:
//===source code====
L2cache=vmalloc(L2SIZE);// L2SIZE=40960
printk(KERN_INFO "find_vm_struct OK:%x
addr:%xnr_pages:%d\n",L2vm,L2vm->addr,L2vm->nr_pages);
for(i=0;i<L2vm->nr_pages;i++)
 {
      if(L2vm->pages[i])
         printk("page allocated:%x\n",page_address(L2vm->pages[i]));
 }
tpage=vmalloc_to_page(L2cache);
printk(KERN_INFO "vmalloc_to_page tpage :%x\n",tpage);
//===========info of dmesg==================
[ 1561.768471] page allocated:73d65000
[ 1561.768474] page allocated:781e9000
[ 1561.768476] page allocated:6203f000
[ 1561.768478] page allocated:57fdf000
[ 1561.768481] page allocated:56ed4000
[ 1561.768483] page allocated:56ed5000
[ 1561.768485] page allocated:64ab6000
[ 1561.768488] page allocated:7cc1e000
[ 1561.768490] page allocated:60ea8000
[ 1561.768492] page allocated:60ea9000
[ 1561.768497] vmalloc_to_page tpage :7fcf7e18
Why the page address get from vmalloc_to_page is different with the first
page address of the vm_struct (73d65000)?

vmalloc_to_page()...
See mm/memory.c for the function and how to use it.
Best regards,
