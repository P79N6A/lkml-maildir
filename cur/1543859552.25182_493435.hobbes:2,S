I'm a bit curious about the whitespace issue - CodingStyle doesn't seem 
to discuss what to do with if statements that end up longer than 80 
characters, which is (I think) what you're talking about?

I dislike that. We're asking to suspend an individual device - whether 
the bus supports devices that need to suspend with interrupts disabled 
is irrelevent, it's the device that we care about. We should just make 
it necessary for every bus to support this method until the interface is 
removed.

It seemed like a logically distinct change, but I'm happy to merge them.

We shouldn't remove interfaces that userland uses until there's been a 
replacement for long enough that userland can switch over. Setting a 
date for removing this interface when most drivers don't implement the 
replacement isn't reasonable.
