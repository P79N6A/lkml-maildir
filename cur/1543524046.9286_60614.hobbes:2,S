On what type of application mix to you base that hypothesis?
Programs which reschedule at a high rate seem usually to be those shunting large
blocks of data around, without doing an awful lot of processing on them. They
can touch a great deal of data in a very short time.
Programs which reschedule less often generally fall into one of two categories.
One class of program rapidly shifts large blocks of data, with lightweight
processing, using select (or some other event handling scheme, like SIGIO). The
other class is doing some heavyweight number crunching, and progresses through
the data comparatively slowly.
I draw almost the opposite conclusion from this mix - fast rescheduling programs
flush the cache rapidly. "Ah!", you may say, "but they only flush the cache when
they have finished with the data, because sending out the results from
processing that data is the very reason for the reschedule". This is true. If
its a genuinely lightweight activity, such as "read some stuff from disk and
throw a section of it at a network connection", one could not do better (unless
you can use busmasting to completely avoid the processor ever seeing the data,
which would be extremely lightweight processing). It certainly doesn't point to
the pattern of cache behaviour which you hypothesise, though.
