Sure. My version of tar (1.15.1) doesn't seem to be able to tar up /sys,
so hopefully this is sufficient:

Each net device has a port structure associated with it, the fields
should be fairly self explanatory, they're all read only I think.

The driver has a connection to all the other lpars, this is entirely
independent of the net devices.

OK. They're not "devices" that we create under the driver, they're just
attributes of the driver, and they happen to be in groups so I put them
in subdirectories.
