It shouldn't be a security problem if mincore doesn't actually
return the data.
The other thing is, that test may not be valid, because it doesn't
guarantee that you have nothing mapped immediately after the
global_pointer region. Maybe a difference in address space layout
is causing it to "correctly" fail on x86-64.
