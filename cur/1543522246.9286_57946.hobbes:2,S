No. They database are not junk afterwards :-) Just you'll be blocked and
unable to send me mail. It's just funny way to not send me mail. Why you'll
do this is sane mind ? If you do not want to send mail to me the do just that:
do not send mail to me. Why you must block itself with ORBS ?

If someone asking for punishment he deserve to be punished. Relaying for ORBS
while not relaying for spammers is just that.

ORBS is not replacement for MAPS RBL for sure. It's complementary service:
MAPS RBL lists systems only after rigorous checking (and this will need
lots of time) but it's hard to pull system out of RBL's blacklist. ORBS
doing blacklist automatically and fast but it's trivial to pull system out of
ORBS blacklist (it it's not open relay anymore that is).

It's systems who want to be punished (ones who doing relay for ORBS but not
any other relay and blocking ORBS altogether) and list of open relays. Of course
if you'll remove first ones from list list will become useless but right now
it's usefull. As complimentary service for MAPS RBL, of course.

Since open relays in ORBS are blocked anyway they are useless for spammers.
