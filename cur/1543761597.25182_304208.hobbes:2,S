I don't think these are doing much for performance. Or at least 
*something* in your tree isn't ...
Kernbench: 
                                     Elapsed    System      User       CPU
 elm3b67      2.6.11                   50.24    146.60   1117.61   2516.67
 elm3b67      2.6.11-mm1               52.27    141.14   1099.91   2374.33
 elm3b67      2.6.11-mm2               51.88    142.41   1104.85   2403.67
 elm3b67      2.6.11-mm4               51.23    145.04   1100.70   2431.00
(elm3b67 is a 16x x440 ia32 NUMA system + HT)
Is there an easy way to just test those sched changes alone?
