Hi Petr,
While slist from 2.2.18 does indeed work with nwserv , nwuserlist does
not. it returns:
schoen3:/user2/download/www/ncpfs-2.2.0.18 # util/nwuserlist
util/nwuserlist: Unknown server (0x89FC) when initializing
schoen3:/user2/download/www/ncpfs-2.2.0.18 # util/slist
Known NetWare File Servers                          Network   Node Address
