Subject: NFS client bug, (Stale NFS file handle)

We beleive we're hitting an NFS client bug:
 Disto: SuSE-9.0 (64 bit)
  Arch: x86_64 SMP
Kernel: 2.4.21 (SuSE k_smp-2.4.21-201)
We're getting stale file handle errors for files in a directory two
levels below the mountpoint.
For example:
hosta$ cd /mountpoint/a/b
hosta$ ls -l
ls: A-spotpr: Stale NFS file handle
ls: B-spotpr: Stale NFS file handle
ls: C-spotpr: Stale NFS file handle
ls: D-spotpr: Stale NFS file handle
ls: E-spotpr: Stale NFS file handle
<snip>
total 0
hosta$ 
HOWEVER...
otherhost$ cd /mountpoint/a/b
otherhost$ ls -l
total 2352
-rw-rw-r--    1 db       data        82896 Mar 25 17:02 A-spotpr
-rw-rw-r--    1 db       data        57840 Mar 25 17:10 B-spotpr
-rw-rw-r--    1 db       data        82896 Mar 25 17:02 C-spotpr
-rw-rw-r--    1 db       data       213840 Mar 25 17:10 D-spotpr
-rw-rw-r--    1 db       data        82896 Mar 25 17:02 E-spotpr
<snip>
otherhost$
Where hosta & otherhost are the same type of machine running the same
OS, and they mount the directories at the same time.
I've never seen this before.  I'm used to seeing system-wide stale
handles for a mountpoint, but never for a specific file under a
mountpoint.
/mountpoint/a works without a problem, as does all files under
/mountpoint/a/c
I can't reliably reproduce this, but I know it happens after the
contents of /mountpoint/a/b are updated with an rsync.
Any help in diagnosing or fixing this will be greatly appreciated.
