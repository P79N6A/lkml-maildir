Still being a little new at this I am not sure if this is an issue at
all or not but I noted that while building the 2.6.23-rc6-git8 kernel
this afternoon I received the following error message: 
Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST 1670 modules
WARNING: Can't handle masks in drivers/mtd/nand/cafe_nand:FFFF0
I have been building each of the kernels in the 2.6.23-rc series and had
not noted this message before.  I apologize if this is a non-issue.
