Later this week I'll have some time to look at the VM things
again. I suspect a lot of the code that was merged into the
-ac kernels either only helped one specific test case by
accident or only works if you think about it from the "right"
point of view ;)
One thing I've noted with many of the VM patches for 2.4 is
that the author goes into great detail describing a VM problem
that occurs and then attaches a patch which "fixes" something
only losely related to the problem described...  ;)
regards,
Rik
