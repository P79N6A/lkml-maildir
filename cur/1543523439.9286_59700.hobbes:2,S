Hello again.
The plot sickens.  In our first installment, we seemed to be able to
do successful writes (these were "-dummy" writes, however) to two
CD-Rs if they were on different channels, while a third CD-R (on the
same channel as the second) apparently never saw commands destined for 
it if that channel master was writing.
Well, we have another intersting data point.  We were merrily burning
a CD-R to "dev=0,1,0", that is, /dev/hdc.  When we tried to start a
burn to /dev/hdb (on a *different* IDE channel!) the same faulty
behavior was seen:  /dev/hdb started grabbing all the commands
intended for /dev/hdc, and the cdrecord process talking to /dev/hdc
bailed out with a sense error.
So this seems to tell me that there is something weird in how ide-scsi 
redirects commands, and that it's sensitive to "active" devices
vs. "inactive" devices (since I can burn just fine to hdd if both hdb
and hdc are inactive!)
And again, starting the burn to /dev/hdb first, then intiating the
burn to hdc, seems to work just fine.
Given that we are contemplating making ide-scsi the norm, I would
appreciate any ideas people can offer.  Mark Hahn has sent me a few
questions, which hopefully are answered in this reply.  If anyone
would like me to run a particular test, I'd be glad to do so.
Thanks for your attention,
t.
