Release candidates are supposed to be bugfix only from -rc1. Everything
else can only be called the "ridiculous count".

Correct, but again 2.4 is a different beast as no active development is
taking place.
In a active development you should move the -rc step out of the
development line into a seperate release line after the -preX steps. 
It has two advantages:
1. The release process is encapsulated and secure against non bugfix
merges. This can be "sold" to users for testing.
2. The development cycle is more continous. While -rc1 is led to release
2.6.X the preparations for 2.6.X+1-pre1 are moving on. This might
shorten the overall release cycles as well.
