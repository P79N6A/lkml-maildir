Well, it might obviously be worthwhile removing the PCI ID's that actually 
do say that they are AHCI. Maybe that's not all of them, but I wouldn't be 
surprised if it's actually the majority of them..
(We had the same issue with "PCI IDE controller". Some PCI IDE controllers 
are clearly exactly that from a programming interface standpoint, but 
because they support RAID in hardware, they claim to be RAID controllers, 
since that is more "glamorous". Gaah ;^).
