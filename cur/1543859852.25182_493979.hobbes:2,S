This is caused by this commit:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=fba2591bf4e418b6c3f9f8794c9dd8fe40ae7bd9
From the log message:
"Some filesystems need to be fixed up for this: CIFS, FUSE, JFS,
ReiserFS, XFS all use the old confusing functions, and will be fixed
separately in subsequent commits (with some of them just removing the
offending logic, and others using clear_page_dirty_for_io())."
The approach seems quite broken to me, the users should have been fixed
_before_ removing the function, so as to avoid compilation failures.
These are a pain for testers, and break git bisect too. Grmbl.
Now that it's done... Steve, can you please take a look and provide a
patch so that cifs builds again?
Thanks,
