Ask me, I had to find that stupid bug..

Sure. If you have a small iov at the end of a vma followed by a large iov
somewhere else then the bytes variable is the number of bytes between the
current file position and the end of the page cache page. That offset is
used in the fault_in_pages_readable call which now will span TWO pages.
For the small iov only one page may get accessed. The second page lies
after the end of the vma. If that vma happens to be the last one before
the stack and the stack size is unlimited then VM_GROWSDOWN will create
a big stack vma. In our case later memory allocations failed because
there wasn't enough virtual address space.

Ok, now there is one admirer more ..
