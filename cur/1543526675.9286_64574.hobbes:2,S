No;( In 2.3.47-6 there's absolutely no chance to get RTC as module (w/o 
heavy patching...). This could only be done some revisions before (and
this worked quite good for me).

Well, not long ago you could build RTC as module (I think in 2.2.x and early
2.3.x kernels). Some time later (~2.3.45 +-3) you *could* simply patch
hw_irq.h to give IRQ8 to RTC and IRQ0 to timer (PIT). _Now_ this is
impossible (doing the patch brings up millions of messages like "unexpected
interrupt on irq 8" or sth like that).
Hopefully RTC is going go be useable as a _module_ in the near future, isn't
it?
