Ah, neither have I though (recent enough that I'd use it.)  I have been
trying to get one from Compaq/DEC for years, but I don't ever seem to
get to the right person.  (Is anyone at Compaq that could actually do
something reading this?)
I'd really like to get fine-granularity timing on Alpha, just like we
have on Intel.   I understand the Alpha only has a 32-bit TSC, which
means it has to be periodically sampled to keep track of the high bits.
