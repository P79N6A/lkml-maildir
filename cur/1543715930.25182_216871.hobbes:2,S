Something has to hint to as to which code to read.  The usual way to
find the offending module is to remove modules until the problem goes
away.  The availability of source code only matters when you have
found which module actually has the bug.  If you have the source you
can fix it, otherwise you can't.  If a bug in an open source module
causes random filesystem corruption people will be just as likely to
blame the filesystem code for it as if the buggy module is closed
source.  This is pretty obvious, because if you don't know where the
bug actually is, the openness of that source code can't possibly make
a difference.
