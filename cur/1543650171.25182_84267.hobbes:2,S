   I may have seen it (once?) before without touching the tape drive,
although I'm not certain. I shall see if I can reproduce without use
of the tape.

   It's not certain. I appear to have triggered it this morning on the
_third_ consecutive run of amflush. Again, I'll test more carefully.

   I've definitely seen the problem throughout the 2.4 series. I don't
recall what the first 2.4 kernel I used was, but it was definitely
there in all mainstream kernels (and those -ac kernels I tried) from
about 2.4.14 onwards. I'll try 2.4.20-preX and report on that as well.
   Thanks for your help. It may be a week or two before I can get all
these tests completed, but I shall definitely report back when I'm
done.
   Hugo.
