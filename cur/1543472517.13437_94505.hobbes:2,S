You guys forget that one of the main reasons for inventing patents in the
first place is to protect someone who dumps a lot of money into developing
something.  If the "something" they sell based on that is easily reverse
engineered and copied, then the reverse engineers have the upper hand, and
always will.  
Trade secrets hinder development of new technology.  Ideas are rarely "out
of the blue".  More often they are straightforward extrapolations of current
ideas.  By limiting the spread of ideas and information, you slow the growth
of technology.
All that said, patents still suck giant giraffe balls.  There's got to be a
better way to both protect the researcher, and encourage free exchange of
ideas.
Anyone want to see my file folder of potential multimillion-dollar products
and companies to start that I will never have time for?
