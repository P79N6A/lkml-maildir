An interesting thing I discovered is that Windows simply ignores the 'x' 
bit (I should say the Windows equivalent of the 'x' bit, called 
"traverse folder / execute file"), but there is a policy setting that 
overrides this attribute.
I know users get tripped up on this a lot in Unix, like when they don't 
understand why the webserver can't read their public_html directory.  It 
might be a good option for Linux.
