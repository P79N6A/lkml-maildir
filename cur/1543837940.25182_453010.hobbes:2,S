No it is not. There are socket queues and they are limited. Things like
TCP behave even better.

Does it? I though it is possible to only have 64k of working sockets per
device in TCP.

Feel free to drop packets as soon as it was found that they belong to
something that you do not want to get data right now.
It is an additional step, not a requirement.
All robust systems are built on top of priveledge separation and layered
access, so one compromised component would not affect other, it was 
proven in a lot of CS theories. In case of reserve, which is based on
main allocator, system still uses SLAB for both types of data flows - 
network and block data, there is always a possibility to have that 
reserve empty or not refilled when OOM happens, so problem is not solved, 
only system painfull death is slightly postponed (and maybe it will solve 
the problem for exact condition, but it's roots are still there).
If system is limited enough to provide enough memory for network tree
allocator, it is possible to create it's own drop condition inside NTA,
but it must be saparated from the weakest chain element in that
conditions - SLAB OOM.
