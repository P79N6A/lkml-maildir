It depends on the details of the situation, right?  For example, it
would not have made sense to integrate RCU into spinlock.h, where most
of the other Linux synchronization primitives live.  On the other hand,
spinlock variants, such as spin_lock_bh(), are integrated into the same
spinlock.h file as the the base spin_lock() functions.
For example, CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT separates out some of its realtime function
into separate files (e.g., kernel/rt.c and include/linux/rt_lock.h),
while other parts of its realtime function are integrated into the rest
of the kernel.
						Thanx, Paul
