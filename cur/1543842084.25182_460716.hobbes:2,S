I've also noticed this differing behavior,
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-ext4&m=115376966821953&w=2
It passed w/o comment.  :)
Unless Ted had a specific reason for changing the behavior, 2.4 and 2.6 
should probably be brought into line.  Calling ext3_commit_super() 
before the panic may defeat (some of) the purpose of the panic option, 
though, which is to preserve as much state as possible at the time of 
the error for later analysis...
