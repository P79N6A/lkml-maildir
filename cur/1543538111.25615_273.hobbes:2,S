Well, in this specific case, I don't think it's PPC related. The need for
this was notified to my by Egbert, from the XFree team, when I talked
about designing a common mecanism to handle mmap'ing of PCI devices to
userland.
AFAIK, all PPCs do "normal" mapping, only the iobase and membase of the
PCI may be different (and per-card, not per-bus-number, at least until I
implement a remapping mecanism like Alpha or Sparc).
