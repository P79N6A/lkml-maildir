When a machine has many gfs file systems mounted at once it can be useful
to know which one failed.  Does the following look ok?
#define gfs2_assert(sdp, assertion)                                       \
do {                                                                      \
        if (unlikely(!(assertion))) {                                     \
                printk(KERN_ERR                                           \
                        "GFS2: fsid=%s: fatal: assertion \"%s\" failed\n" \
                        "GFS2: fsid=%s:   function = %s\n"                \
                        "GFS2: fsid=%s:   file = %s, line = %u\n"         \
                        "GFS2: fsid=%s:   time = %lu\n",                  \
                        sdp->sd_fsname, # assertion,                      \
                        sdp->sd_fsname,  __FUNCTION__,                    \
                        sdp->sd_fsname, __FILE__, __LINE__,               \
                        sdp->sd_fsname, get_seconds());                   \
                BUG();                                                    \
        }                                                                 \
