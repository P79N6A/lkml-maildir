Indeed, this is the "who should manage the list" problem.
Probably the answer is that whoever transitions the NAPI_STATE_SCHED
bit from cleared to set should do the list addition.
Patches welcome :-)

This is why minimal levels of HW interrupt mitigation should be enabled
in your chip.  If it does not support this, you will indeed need to look
into using high resolution timers or other schemes to alleviate this.
I do not think it deserves a generic core networking helper facility,
the chips that can't mitigate interrupts are few and obscure.
