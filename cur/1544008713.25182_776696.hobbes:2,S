Hm, as this patch changes the UIO userspace/kernelspace interface, how
about also documenting it in the existing UIO documentation so that
people know it is there, and so that we can properly review if it is a
sane change.
ALso, for kernel/user api changes, you should cc: the
linux-api@vger.kernel.org mailing list so that it can be reviewed there
by the people trying to maintain the kernel documentation.
thanks,
