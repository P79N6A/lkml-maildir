Yes it will, precisely because during the time you spend processing flow #1,
you're still receiving data for flow #2. I really invite you to try. That's
what I've been observing for years of userland coding of proxies.

I also observe 23000 bytes on average on gigabit, which is very good
(only about 5000 calls per second). And the CPU usage is lower than
with recv/send, and I'd like to be able to run some profiling because
I observed very different performance patterns depending on the network
cards used. Generally, almost all the time is spent in softirqs.
It's easy to make poll wait a little bit more : call it later and do
your work before calling it. Also, epoll_wait() lets you ask it to
return just a few amount of FDs. This really improves data gathering.
I generally observe best performance between 30-200 FDs per call, even
with 10000 concurrent connections. During the time I process the first
200 FDs, data is accumulating in the other's buffers.

Yes, I agree about that. But my comment was about not making this
behaviour mandatory for splice(). Letting the application choose is
the way to go, of course.

Yes but that's not always easy to guess how many data you can feed
into the pipe. It seems that depending on how the segments are
gathered, you can store between 16 segments and 64 kB. I have
observed some cases in blocking mode where I could not push more
than a few kbytes with a small MSS, indicating to me that all those
segments were each on a distinct page. I don't know precisely how
that's handled internally.

OK, I initially understood that you suggested we could simply remove
it like I did for splice.

Agreed :-)
