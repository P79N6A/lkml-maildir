No, the logic to enable MSI in a driver today is simple, and
straight-forward.  A single call to pci_enable_msi().  If instead the
driver wants to enable MSI-X, they call pci_enable_msix().  Contrast
that with the logic of:
	- if MSI is enabled, disable it for some devices.
	- if driver wants to enable MSI-X, do:
		pci_disable_msi();
		e = pci_enable_msix();	// which I think some people
					// said will always fail anyway
					// due to MSI being enabled
					// already.
		if (e)
			pci_enable_msi();
So, we do that, MSI-X is now more complex and harder to enable (and
that's the future for PCI devices from what people are saying.)
Anyway, I'm just repeating myself now...
thanks,
