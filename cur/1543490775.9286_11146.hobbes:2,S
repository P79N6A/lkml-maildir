    Will the Linux kernel always be a meek follower of whatever the
    standard of the week is, or will it contribute useful new things to
    the state of the art for Unix systems?
    I don't know about you, but I think that a Linux that meekly follows
    the standards set by the other Unix vendors is a Linux that's going
    to be stabbed repeatedly in the back whenever the other vendors feel
    that they don't have enough market share.
    A better question is 'is this a good thing to change?'   If it's a
    good thing to change, it will make its way into the baseline for
    Unix, just like many other things have over the past 25 or so years.
