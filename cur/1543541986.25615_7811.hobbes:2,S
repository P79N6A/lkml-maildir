Now, _I'm puzzled_ ;-)  None of these command-line options mean spit.
(you should not need load_ramdisk=1, that's implicit in initrd=, and
you shouldn't need to say explicitly what the rd size is.. that's a
responsibility of the boot-loader. [why this option boot=/dev/fd0u1743,vfat])
Please send me (offline) your grep '=[ym]' .config output to stare at.
I don't doubt that it doesn't work for you, but it works fine for me.
