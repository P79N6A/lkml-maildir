Had the patch been available at the time, I would've done so, but only
the kernel tarballs were available at that time - SunSITE UK didn't
get the patches mirrored until at least 3 hours after I posted the
above message - that's how long I was on for, and they hadn't arrived
when I logged off, but were there when I logged on the following
lunchtime...
Best wishes from Riley.
