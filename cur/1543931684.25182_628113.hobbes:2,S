hm, any intelligent way to force PCI posting? I guess not.
here's a list of candidate drivers (match the out*_p() pattern and do 
pci)
./char/epca.c 
./char/sonypi.c
./scsi/megaraid.c
./ide/pci/serverworks.c
./ide/pci/cmd640.c
./input/mouse/pc110pad.c
./i2c/busses/i2c-amd756.c
./i2c/busses/i2c-ali15x3.c
./i2c/busses/i2c-ali1563.c
./i2c/busses/i2c-ali1535.c
./i2c/busses/i2c-viapro.c
./i2c/busses/i2c-nforce2.c
./i2c/busses/i2c-i801.c
./i2c/busses/i2c-piix4.c
./hwmon/vt8231.c
./hwmon/via686a.c
./hwmon/sis5595.c
./telephony/ixj.c
./net/irda/donauboe.c
./watchdog/pcwd_pci.c
./watchdog/wdt_pci.c

which seems to suggest we are better off not doing the port 0x80 trick 
at all.
