The point was that noone else than hid/hid-core.c would ever be going to 
include this header with blacklist. The blacklist is growing in time quite 
rapidly and having it in the middle of the code just didn't look pretty - 
currently you have to perform some scrolling effort just to skip from 
usbhid_init_reports() to hid_find_max_report(), which just looks very sad 
to me.
But OK, I will leave it in there.
