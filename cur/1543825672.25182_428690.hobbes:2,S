Locks are simple, and in fact are _made_ simple on purpose. We try very 
hard to unlock in the same function that we lock, for example. Because if 
we don't, bugs happen.
That's simply not _practical_ for IO. Think about it. Quite often, the 
waiting is done somewhere else than the actual submission.

Pretty much all of them.
Where do you wait for IO?
Would you perhaps say "wait_on_page()"?
In other words, we really _do_ exactly what you think we should do.

A _particular_ way of doing plugging is not "fundamentally right". I'm 
perfectly happy with chaning the place we unplug, if people want that. 
We've done it several times.
But plugging as a _concept_ is definitely fundamentally right, exactly 
because it allows us to have the notion of "plug + n*<random submit by 
different paths> + unplug".
And you were not suggesting moving unplugging around. You were suggesting 
removing the feature. Which is when I said "no f*cking way!".
