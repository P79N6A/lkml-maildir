Nothing. Now I found the problem. In my case, there are symlinks/regular
files got deleted/created very frequently in the same directory. That exaplains
why Solaris calls READLINKon a newly created regular file since it has the
same file handle as the previously removed symlink.
Linus, can we add a generation count or something like that in Linux's inode?
Thanks.
