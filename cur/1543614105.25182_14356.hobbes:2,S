Right!  Any ideas on variable system runqueue load?  Should those
other tasks be RT or OTHER? a mix?  I would suspect that we would
want multiple RT tasks on the runqueue or at least in the system
(otherwise why worry about global semantics?).
However, I would feel better about this if someone had a real world
load involving RT tasks on a SMP system.  At least then we could try
to simulate a load someone cares about.
