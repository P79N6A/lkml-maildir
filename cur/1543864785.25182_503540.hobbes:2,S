Thanks for the clarifications.
Regarding the longstanding CIFS/reiserfs/XFS problems, it seems the 
status is:
CIFS:
commit cb876f451455b6187a7d69de2c112c45ec4b7f99
  Fix up CIFS for "test_clear_page_dirty()" removal
queued for 2.6.19.3
applies and compiles against 2.6.16
reiserfs:
commit de14569f94513279e3d44d9571a421e9da1759ae
  [PATCH] resierfs: avoid tail packing if an inode was ever mmapped
backport to 2.6.16 required
XFS:
