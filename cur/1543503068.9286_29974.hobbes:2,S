I've got my fat16/32 resizer running with lots of limitations (can only
move end of partition, and in most cases, only shrink...) at
www.alphalink.com.au/~clausen/fsresize
I've almost got it to remove all of the above restrictions, with a much
nicer API, at:
www.alphalink.com.au/~clausen/parted
Lennert's ext2 resizer (which will eventually become part of GNU parted)
is also coming along:  www.dsv.nl/~buytenh/ext2resize

This part seems sane :-)

Why does it need to sleep() ?

What does an ioctl() of 2 do?

I don't believe in magic :-)  Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I do:
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1 bs=512 count=1024
then
$ mount /dev/hdb1
should fail, right?  It should even be able to probe what fs type it is,
let alone mount it.
Well it DOESN'T!  It only "doesn't work" after I run parted, and it
fails.
OOPS - I just noticed that close() doesn't get called on the
device (/dev/hdb) after an error.  So I guess it's only fopen()ed files
that get flushed and closed.  But it still seems a bit dodgey that the
cache keeps the data, even after writes succeed from other processes.
