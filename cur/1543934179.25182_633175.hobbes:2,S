Good - I will ignore the xfs bits.

You can do this simpler:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS +=	 -I$(src) -I$(src)/linux-2.6 -funsigned-char
+
+XFS_LINUX := linux-2.6
+
+ifeq ($(CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG),y)
+	EXTRA_CFLAGS += -g
+endif
+
like this:
ccflags-y := -I$(src) -I$(src)/linux-2.6 -funsigned-char
ccflags-$(CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG) += -g
XFS_LINUX := linux-2.6

$(objtree) specify the build directory and is only rarely used.
Half of the current users are buggy and I should fix it one day.
