Subject: RFC: i386: kill !4KSTACKS

4Kb kernel stacks are the future on i386, and it seems the problems it
initially caused are now sorted out.
Does anyone knows about any currently unsolved problems?
I'd like to:
- get a patch into on of the next -mm kernels that unconditionally 
  enables 4KSTACKS
- if there won't be new reports of breakages, send a patch to
  completely remove !4KSTACKS for 2.6.15
In -mm, Reiser4 still has a dependency on !4KSTACKS.
I've mentioned this at least twice to the Reiser4 people, and they 
should check why this dependency is still there and if there are still 
stack issues in Reiser4 fix them.
If not people using Reiser4 on i386 will have to decide whether to 
switch the filesystem or the architecture...
