No, you are just lucky.
The problem is that root (uid=0) is not a special case anymore, and you can't
do something like this:
setrlimit(NPROC)
fork()
setuid(user)
setrlimit() and fork() are executed in root context, so sterlimit
apllies to root, not the user you're setuid to :(
Why is this so? root should be able to do fork() regardless of any limits,
and IMHO the following patch is the right thing.
