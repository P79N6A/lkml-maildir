Thank you for those references. I must have mistyped something while
searching, since all the keywords I searched for were in the

No, I haven't. I just put that question in the mail as a side-thing. I
had not expected more than a yes/no reply. In any case, I will read

Admittedly, I'm still using the RH8 hotplug scripts, and I suspect
improvements have been made since then. I was mainly looking for a way

anything as root. I have all the info I need now, though.
Thank you very much for your help.
