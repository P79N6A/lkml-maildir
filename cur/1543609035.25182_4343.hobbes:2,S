The sse version is prefered over the others and gets used regardless of
speed if it's available:
/* We force the use of the SSE xor block because it can write around L2.
   We may also be able to load into the L1 only depending on how the cpu
   deals with a load to a line that is being prefetched.  */
Bye, Martin
