Are you saying that it isn't?  Have you look at gcc-generated assembly
from a recent 2.2.x or 2.4.x kernel?
2.2.x build command line, note use of "...align...":
/usr/bin/kgcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/spare/cvs/linux_2_2/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing
-D__SMP__ -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2
-malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686   -c -o extable.o
extable.c
2.4.x, note "preferred-stack-boundary" and generated asm code...
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/spare/cvs/linux_2_4/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include
/spare/cvs/linux_2_4/include/linux/modversions.h   -c -o emd.o emd.c
