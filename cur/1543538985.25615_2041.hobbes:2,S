ROFL
Why do you always say that right *after* you write down a
bogus argument yourself?  ;)

So the DMA zone will be exhausted and DMA allocations will
fail when we're unlucky?  That sounds like exactly the thing
zoned VM was supposed to prevent.

No.
If we age the pages from *all* zones the same, we can easily
see which zone has the largest percentage/number/.. of old
pages.
In that case the allocator can have a pretty good idea where
to do its next allocation. This fixes balancing between zones
without us having to throw away data early.

Ermm, and what information would that be?

Which is not at all because of the classzone idea, but because of
some other, unrelated, optimisations. 
(I can find you the relevant quote where you agreed to this, if
you insist on it)
