Not to mention on boot-up check to make sure the module still loads 
without warnings on the current kernel (or make sure the module exists 
in the current /lib/modules directory.

Problem: Most distributors modify their kernel somewhat.  Some enough 
to cause binary module incompatibility with the 'stock' kernel.  
Matching running kernel and source code kernel would be tricky, to
say the least.
>  o install the source in some temporary location
Why not just make the includes directory get installed somewhere.  
Somewhere like /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/includes (especially since
make install puts a symlink at /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build anyway)
You also need to prep the extracted kernel with the proper .config, etc.
which isn't always in the source package from some distributors.

The biggest problem is people not having installed the C compiler, and 
related tools.  Or having not installed the kernel headers matching 
their version of the kernel.
