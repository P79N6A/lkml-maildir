Not necessarily broken, but the behaviour is a bit different
from what you thought it was. At some point in time it was
decided that the partition table is written in hardware sectorsize
units, not in units of 512-byte sectors. (No doubt because MSDOS
software does the same.)
This means that when you see

and do

then you actually claim that there are 32*64*1243 = 2545664 sectors,
but there are only 1273011, so it is not surprising that you get
complaints about trying to write past the end of the disk.
Make sure you have a somewhat recent fdisk, so that you can specify
the sectorsize with the -b option, if necessary.
