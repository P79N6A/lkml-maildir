	Like I said in the previous e-mail, I'm using right now an
	Asus A7V mobo with Linus' stock kernel 2.2.18 with André's
	patches.
	I'm using basically a Debian potato here with XFree86 3.3.6
	and a Microsoft Intellimouse (with IMPS/2 protocol) and
	everything seems to be working fine. Before my brand new 40GB
	Samsung HD died, I was using a more modified potato, including
	XFree86 4.0.1e (or 4.0.1f, I don't remember). Everything was
	also working fine with this older setup.

	I usually only follow Alan's pre series when things are broken
	with the final releases, so I don't know about 2.2.18preX. I'm
	sorry that I can't help.

	Unfortunately, I have never ever seen a USB device, so I have
	no experience here to help you.

	No, but have you tried changing the mouse? I've had problems
	with a Matrox G400 AGP 16MB monohead that I purchased when I
	got my system. It did crash when X was running in Linux and
	FreeBSD (and many versions of X, for that matter), but under
	Windows it worked flawlessly.
	When I used Matrox's drivers with XFree86 4.x, it worked
	perfectly.  I changed my Matrox and now I'm using a new one
	under X 3.3.6 under potato (a stable platform that I use) and
	everything is fine).
	So, perhaps you could try changing your mouse?
	[]s, Roger...
