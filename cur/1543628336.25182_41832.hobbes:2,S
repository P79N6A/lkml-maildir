*blink*  I had not noticed that.
All drivers actually need to handle RxNoBufs and RxOverflow, assuming
they have similar meaning to what I'm familiar with on other chips.
The chip may recover transparently, but one should be at least aware of
them.
RxEarly you very likely do -not- want to handle...
