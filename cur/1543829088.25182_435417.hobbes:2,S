What do you mean with killed PCI Express? PCI Express should
work even without extended config space, except error handling.
Error handling seems to be still a quite obscure feature,
not used by many people - so booting is more important than
supporting it. Still would be good to support it of course.
You're saying that you have lots of machines where the mmconfig
aperture is not fully reserved in e820?
Is it partially reserved (not for all busses) or not at all?

If someone does a patch to double check it against the ACPI name space
I'm not opposed to let it overrule the e820 heuristic.
The point of this code is to pragmatically detect BIOS with obviously 
broken setups. It's not about standards lawyering.
