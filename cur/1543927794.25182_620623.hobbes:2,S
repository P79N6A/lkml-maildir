i'm not sure if i agree with "usually"... but i know you (alan) are 
probably aware of the exact requirements of the hw.
for everyone else:
on intel x86 processors an access is unaligned only if it crosses a 
cacheline boundary (64 bytes).  otherwise it's aligned.  the penalty for 
crossing a cacheline boundary varies from ~12 cycles (core2) to many 
dozens of cycles (p4).
on AMD x86 pre-family 10h the boundary is 8 bytes, and on fam 10h it's 16 
bytes.  the penalty is a mere 3 cycles if an access crosses the specified 
boundary.
if you're making <= 4 byte accesses i recommend not worrying about 
alignment on x86.  it's pretty hard to beat the hardware support.
i curse all the RISC and embedded processor designers who pretend 
unaligned accesses are something evil and to be avoided.  in case you're 
worried, MIPS patent 4,814,976 expired in december 2006 :)
