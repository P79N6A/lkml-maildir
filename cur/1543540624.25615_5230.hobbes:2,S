   When compiling arch/sparc/math-emu/math.c I get many, many
   complaints that they aren't defined. gcc-2.96-41 compiled from Red
   Hat rawhide (just for fun and fireworks)
Due to all the various known cpp bugs in the compiler (which are being
fixed steadily over time) in that compiler.  I'm going to ignore this
one for now :-)
Later,
