How do you think we should go about IRQ routing
without reading BIOS tables? If you have a viable
solution, I'd be happy to listen to it.
Accessing PCI configuration space is trivial. Only two or
three ways actually exist on x86. The IRQ routing is different.
Every little motherboard vendor routes them differently.
