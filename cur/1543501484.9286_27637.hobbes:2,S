Or find a way to prevent PC bios from wiping memory on hard reset, and
then add a dumper routine to lilo or the kernel. Eg lilo dumps ram to the
swap partition, which is then picked up during swapon when linux boots,
and written out to /var/adm/crash/
At least I understand this is the way IRIX and HP/UX do it.
