    This is a typical problem with the BTL numbering that any 2.4.x
modular Linux kernel running without hotplug or udev has. And, at
least to my knowledge and in /dev/sg side, it can be fixed using
hotplug or udev (in 2.6.x). The BTL problem cannot.

    I think so. Martin was being very respectuf.

    And that's a pity, because it is a waste of human resources. And
the bigger problem is that I still don't know why BTL is better than
/dev/sg, and I've tried to understand it from the thread. I would be
glad to hear Jörg explanations, but he thinks I'm trying to FUD :(
