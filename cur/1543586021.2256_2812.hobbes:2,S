followup:
if using older 3.5 reiserfs format cp just gets stuck in WCHAN=do_jour...
problem is reproducable,
also 2.4.3-pre8, not tested others.
first file is where it happens probably, it is /usr/X11R6/bin something on
redhat70.
At least X11R6/bin is made as only directory and attemt to look into that
ends up  with waiting on semaphore.
the same time, peaceful "touch somefile" just works.
