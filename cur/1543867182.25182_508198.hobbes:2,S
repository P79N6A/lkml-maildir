I don't follow.
list_for_each gives you a list_head.
list_for_each_entry gives you a pointer to an entry in the list, which
is equivalent to the above loop which gives a pointer to an entry in the
array. Accordingly, it should be called array_for_each_entry. What sort
of logic leads to another conclusion?
array_for_each_index gives an index into the array.
I offer no opinion on the merit of such macros, just their names.
