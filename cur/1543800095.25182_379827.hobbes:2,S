indeed - i have fixed this and have uploaded a new version to:

these are various things one might be interested in gathering on a live 
system. Enabling more of them means higher runtime overhead.  
WAKEUP_TIMING only measures the worst-case wakeup cost, it's the 
lowest-overhead option. It's activated via resetting the worst-case 
cost:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
The histogram ones are gathering a histogram (but no traces) into 
/proc/latency_hist/<cpu_nr>. These have some overhead as they hook into 
every preempt-disable/enable call. Output is:
  $ head -15 /proc/latency_hist/wakeup_latency/CPU0
  #Minimum latency: 2 microseconds.
  #Average latency: 7 microseconds.
  #Maximum latency: 511 microseconds.
  #Total samples: 5241
  #There are 0 samples greater or equal than 10240 microseconds
  #usecs           samples
      0                  0
      1                  0
      2                  7
      3               2041
      4                921
      5                194
      6                 62
      7                502
      8                119
  ...
The LATENCY_TRACING option does full tracing of critical sections 
[driven by e.g. WAKEUP_TIMING - but it can also be activated by 
interrupts, or be completely user-driven via userspace calls], which 
trace is then put into /proc/latency_trace - mcount done for every 
function call in the kernel. This can add up to 30% of runtime overhead 
[or worse], but is obviously very useful for debugging latencies.
