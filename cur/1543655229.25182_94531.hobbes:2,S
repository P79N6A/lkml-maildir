That doesn't sound like a simplification ;)

True.  And I'd like /bin/sync to _really_ be synchronous because
I use `reboot -f' all the time.  Even though SuS-or-POSIX say that
sync() only needs to _start_ the IO.  That's rather silly.

OK.  How about we do it that way in in 2.5 and then look at a backport?
With the steps I propose above, filesystems which don't implement
sync_fs would see no changes, so it should be safe.
