it's a bit too late to get the out-of-tree module into v2.6.24, and the 
revert makes little sense without the extra out-of-tree module. We at a 
minimum need a clear explanation of why this functionality cannot be 
provided via kprobes/systemtap.

it's a clear answer 1 week after the merge window opens, but not 1 week 
before the next stable kernel is released.
