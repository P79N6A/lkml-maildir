Hello list.
My friend and I are trying to put together an old P133 box as a small
server, but we can't even boot the kernel.
We tried booting from RedHat's CDs versions from 6.0 to 7.2 as well as
with a vanilla 2.4.17 kernel compiled for Pentium with gcc-2.96-98.
The problem is 100% repeatable and looks as follows:
(normal boot messages)
Calibrating delay loop... and here we get different oopses, i.e.
Unable to handle paging request or General Protection Fault and a few others.
Often the oops mesage was incomplete, as if the kernel hanged while writing
it. It is totally random at this point.
So, if anyone has _any_ idea where to look for the cause of this problem,
we'd really appreciate it.
Could this be a hardware problem?
