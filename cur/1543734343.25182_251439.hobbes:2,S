There is a gross error in the 2.6.9-rc1-mm4 version of the r8169 driver
which could be related to your bug.
A few patches have been posted on netdev amongst which the first should
make things better (see [PATCH 2.6.9-rc1-mm4 x/4] on netdev the 10 of
september 2004)
Can you apply the patch below on top of 2.6.9-rc1-mm4 and report
if it makes things better:
