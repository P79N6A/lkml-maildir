Sounds great, I would be happy to help review it. If we can create a
bit of common infrastructure, the dcache conversion might become a bit
more palatable and we could look at other things like the inode hash
as well.

You're right, the mask is currently just an int, so my patch should
not be messing with that. Thanks.
The other thing you'll have to be careful of when looking at doing
an implementation, is that I think I forgot to use the RCU accessors
(rcu_assign_pointer, rcu_dereference) when assigning and loading
the new/old hash table pointers.
