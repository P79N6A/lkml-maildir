Hi, I just happen to be the maintainer "this initrd patch" ;-) I agree 
with you Thomas. IMHO, this patch is really useful in our "not so 
perfect" world. Few more comments below:

This is really feature #1, PC manufacturers come to sometimes extremely 
ugly things when they code their ACPI tables. You can find lots of BIOS 
containing in their ACPI tables tests like "do this if OS name is 13 
letters long, and that if OS name is 11 letters long..." Obviously 
Linux is most of the time not within those tests!
1.5) Feature adding. Some (crazy?) people are working on new 
implementation of their ACPI table to add features (cf the "Smart 
Battery System for Linux" project).
In those two cases, you really can't expect every user to recompile it's 
Linux kernel to get an new DSDT table :-)

Agree, although I  believe of this as more an excuse than a reason. 
Linux is still full of bugs, lots of which cannot be fixed by ACPI table 
swapping anyway...

Well, I think even Len agree with this usage :-)
All in all, I'm really _not_ asking for inclusion of the patch in the 
main tree. Just asking you not to think too much bad of the distros 
which use this patch ;-) (IIRC, at least Mandriva and Ubuntu include it 
in addition to SuSE)
See you,
Eric
