Funny you should mention that, since I just this minute completed a small
hack for the benefit of Andrew Morton, who likes to be able to have his
.config as a symlink.  Yes it was easy, even starting from a state of
nearly complete cluelessness.  And before anybody asks, no I did not do the
job properly, I do not pretend or want to be a member of the kbuild team.
I just wanted to know how hard it is to hack this thing.
