This patch breaks Inaky's API anyway, plist_del() now has only one
argument, and I think this is good.
I don't mind doing s/plist_next_entry/plist_entry/ if you wish,
but I think this is consistent with plist_next/plist_prev helpers.
And original plist_empty() is confusing. When used on plist's head
it is ok, but it is wrong to use plist_empty(&plist_node).

Is it bad?
Yes, plist_empty/plist_unhashed mimics hlist_empty/hlist_unhashed.
