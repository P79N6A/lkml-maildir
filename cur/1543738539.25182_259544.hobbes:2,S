Hello!
Con Kolivas repoted this to work for him, but he also told me he's 
clutching at straws since his swsusp knowledge is small and  
Pavel Machek explained freeing memory is basically vm code he only
calls. So I post this here everybody can read it.
Trying to suspend an ck-kernel results in the system hanging while freeing 
memory. This behavior is caused by Staircase scheduler. Sane 2.6.9-rc{3,4} 
works fine.
Any chance to get it working? Let me know if you need more inforamtion.
