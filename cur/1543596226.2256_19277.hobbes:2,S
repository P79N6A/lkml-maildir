It still sounds like a driver bug.  It is the driver's responsibility to
ensure its resources are locked down for its own use.
Probing should not succeed if there is an existing driver in the
kernel.  request_??? and register_??? functions return failure to
guarantee this sort of thing.
Someone please provide a list of drivers which behave in this manner, so
that they can be fixed up.
