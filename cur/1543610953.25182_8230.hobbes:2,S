Hi,
I am unable to understand the purpose for recursivly calling the function
cpu_raise_softirq.
Problem defination: In the file softirq.c I got this problem.
1.Device Driver for scheduling its bottom half calls the function mark_bh
which in turn calls the   function tasklet_hi_schedule.
2.tasklet_hi_schedule calls the function cpu_raise_softirq which in turn
wakes up task ksoftirqd.
3.The task ksoftirrd calls the function tasklet_hi_action which in turns
calls cpu_raise_softirq.
Reply ASAP
Regards
Chandrasekhar
