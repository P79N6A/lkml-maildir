You are very wrong about this. First of all, everything I listed is
a generic cross-platform CPU feature. Second of all, you can report
the MMU type as "i386mmu" or "integrated".

Your point? If the memory bus speed can be determined, report it.
These are all cross-platform concepts.

That's a straw man. You can keep your crummy old backwards-compatible
/proc/cpuinfo format. I intend to keep mine.
And why shouldn't I be able to put bells'n'whistles in userspace?

**GROAN**
Hell no. I think you tried to misinterpret that, but...
Existing way:
I must write architecture-specific code to parse /proc/cpuinfo, along
with code to actually use AltiVec, MMX, 3dNow, etc.
Better way:
I write generic code to query for features. This could be a parser.
I write architecture-specific code to actually use the features, but
this code can use the generic code to ask about features.
Vaguely like this:
#ifdef __i386__
  if(cpu_feature_query(CF_3dNow) fn = render_3dnow;
  else if(cpu_feature_query(CF_KNI)   fn = render_katmai;
#endif
#ifdef __JES_CPU__
  if(cpu_feature_query(CF_UltraFoo3D) fn = render_ufoo3;
  else if(cpu_feature_query(CF_Foo3Dplus) fn = render_foo3p;
  else if(cpu_feature_query(CF_Foo3D) fn = render_foo3;
#endif
Today, I can not write a generic cpu_feature_query() function.
I have to write a parser for each architecture. That sucks.
Perhaps even worse is the ill-defined format. Try to guess the syntax
of a /proc/cpuinfo file. Now, how do you know you are right? You are
obviously _wrong_, because you guessed at something that is not defined.
Kernel hackers often feel free to play with the layout.
