(VM of 2.2.0-final is GREAT, but this mail is not about this ...)
We've got a server running Linux 2.2.0-final and acting as NFS server
for many other Linux machines. Some hours ago knfsd put an 'oppps'
message onto terminal. It must be said that nobody could mount
the server before the opps either ... Kernel modules nfsd,lockd,sunrpc
stuck in memory and we can't rmmod them after stopping knfs server via
stopping its rc script. Then I tried to start user space NFS server,
but it didn't worked to. On server side I strace-ed rpc.mountd :

[... many times ...]
What is ERESTARTNOHAND ? man page of select() does not contain any information
on this error.
It can be important that we haven't got any problem until a power fault
occured and we can't reach our name server, but any hosts eg in
/etc/exports are given by theit IP addresses so I don't understand
the problem ...
It's sad, but we haven't got the opps message because of the broken
remote syslog mechanism casued by non-reachable server we're logging to ...

ii  nfs-server      2.2beta37-1    User space NFS server.
(In /usr/src/linux/Changes 2.2beta40 is mentioned but I haven't had any
problem using 2.2.0-preX kernels with this nfs-server package on my
Linux for months)
----
Another question about NFS : If I remove some files or directories on
an exported directory at the server side, client which try to access produces
MANY messages into syslog which is very ugly. I think it would be better
to simply ignore these requests.
