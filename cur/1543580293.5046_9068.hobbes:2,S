I will try this, but my card has (and does) worked with irq sharing for
a long time.  Its entry in /proc/interrupts:
  9:     164935     165896   IO-APIC-level  acpi, bttv
I find it strange that a driver that had worked with shared interrupts
for a long time would suddenly cease to function with shared interrupts,
and would consider this a bug.  I will try changing the slot, but
getting it to not share interrupts will be difficult considering the
number of pci devices I have.
