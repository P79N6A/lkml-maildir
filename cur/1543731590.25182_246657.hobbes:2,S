I went to linux-2.6.8-rc1-ck6 when i found this problem to exist in 
2.6.7 and patches to the kernel and the problem went away.  But I was 
told it had nothing t odo with the ck6 patchset as it didn't touch the 
area that was effected (as i was told anyway).  
I've just upgraded to 2.6.9-rc1-mm1 (with nick's patch and mm's patches 
backed out as he suggested to do).  Now the kernel does not leak memory, 
which it did with vanilla 2.6.9-rc1. 
Audio writing however doesn't seem to be using dma. I get heavy io 
related cpu usage when burning the cd that brings write speed and system 
responsiveness down significantly. This should not be  obviously and i 
was wondering if that had something to do with why the mem leak no 
longer exists or if it's something else entirely separate.  Note, in ck6 
audio writing was fine and did not exibit this non-dma-like behavior and 
no configuration changes were made between versions. DMA is detected and 
enabled for the drive in data mode.
