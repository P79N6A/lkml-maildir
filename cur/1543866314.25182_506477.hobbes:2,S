this isnt a one-to-one change ... let's look at the typical
mkimage-missing scenario ...
with mkuboot.sh you'd get output like:
...
  UIMAGE  arch/blackfin/boot/vmImage
"mkimage" command not found - U-Boot images will not be built
  Building modules, stage 2.
...
with mkimage you'd get output like:
...
  UIMAGE  arch/blackfin/boot/vmImage
/bin/sh: mkimage: command not found
make[1]: *** [arch/blackfin/boot/vmImage] Error 127
make: *** [vmImage] Error 2
so while you could change all the Makefile's to insert - to ignore
*all* failures, without the script, you loose the ability to only
ignore "binary missing" errors
