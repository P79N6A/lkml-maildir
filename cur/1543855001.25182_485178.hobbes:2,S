As I suspected, nothing sticks out in these logs as the problem here is
not due to a maxed out system. The traces look fairly identical, less
time spent in copy_user with the splice approach.
Comparing the generic_file_buffered_write() and splice-to-file path,
there really isn't a whole lot of difference. It would be interesting to
try and eliminate some of the differences between the two approaches -
could you try and change the vmsplice to a write-to-pipe instead? And
add SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK to the splice-to-file as well. Basically I'm
interested in a something that only really tests splice-to-file vs
write-to-file. Perhaps easier if you can just run fio to test that, I'm
inlining a job file to test that specifically.
; -- start job file
[global]
bs=64k
rw=write
overwrite=0
size=16g
end_fsync=1
direct=0
unlink
[write]
ioengine=sync
[splice]
stonewall
ioengine=splice
; -- end job file
You can grab a fio snapshot here:
http://brick.kernel.dk/snaps/fio-git-20061123122325.tar.gz
You probably want to run that a few times to see how stable the results
are, buffered io is always a little problematic from a consistency point
of view in benchmark results.
