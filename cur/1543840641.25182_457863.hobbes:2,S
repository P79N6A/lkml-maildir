You're right. The Solaris side of things treats this as signed. I'm not sure how
the user reporting this problem ended up with partitions larger than 1 TB. It
looks like Solaris just treats the entire label as invalid and rejects the whole thing.
I'm not sure how many people out there are using Sun disk labels with sizes > 1TB.
It seems like a pretty rare corner case, but there's no reason any data stored in
those partitions wouldn't be invalid, and it will suddenly cut them off. Is this a
rare enough occurrence that we don't care?
The following patch rejects the partitions, but it would be trivial to switch it
to a warning. I'll post it separately if we agree this is the correct solution.

 Solaris treats Sun disklabel partition sizes as a signed int, and rejects
 partitions that claim to be larger than 1 TB.
 Linux likewise treats the sector count as a signed int, but doesn't do
 any checking, and passes it to put_partition, which casts it causing it to
 be sign extended.
 This patch performs checking to see if individual partitions are valid, and
 rejects the disk label entirely if they are not.
