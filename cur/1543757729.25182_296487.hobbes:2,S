Hello Parag and George,
Thanks for immediate reply.
The main problem is I am working on a SMP system. I have written a small
program that just calls the gettimeofday(), one billion times. I have
run it with time utility and it takes almost double time on SMP then a
UP.
with kernel 2.6.10 on UP
real    4m5.495s
user    1m17.088s
sys     2m48.046s
With Kernel 2.6.10 on SMP
real    6m24.485s
user    1m43.723s
sys     4m30.749s
And the fact is this SMP machine is faster and with more memory than the
UP one. In SMP systems it make a spinlock every time it got called,
synchronizes both the processors, and unlock them. Thats all I know
about it.
George I am just working on your suggestion, let me know if it will work
for SMPs.
If there is some good implementation for SMP, please let me know.
Thanks,
- Puneet
