qemu doesn't (and shouldn't) do accounting; that's best done by 
interrupt driven code.
The patches do account for guest time in a separate counter; guest time 
is added to both user time and the new counter.  This allows an old 
'top' to see guest time (accounted as user time), and a new 'top' to 
separate guest time and user time by performing the appropriate 
mathematical operation.
