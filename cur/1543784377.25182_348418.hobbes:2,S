I second this :)
Browsed a little through the docs/patches... seems to fit very well into
a resource management solution (hint CKRM :) than CPUSET (resource
isolation).
I can see the usefulness of resource management inside CPUSET. We have
had discussions earlier(in lkml and lse-tech) about how CKRM can play
inside a CPUSET, and this plays directly into that, providing resource
management inside a CPUSET.
The parameters used, guarantee and limit, fits very well into CKRM's
shares usage model.
Takahiro-san, How much effort you think will be needed to make this work
under CKRM. thanks.
