Hi Ingo, Andrew,
Here are a few updates to the vSMP architecture bits in the x86 tree.
This is a set of 4 patches which do the following:
1. Fix is_vsmp_box() to actually detect if the system is a vSMPowered box
2. Fix build issue when CONFIG_PCI is enabled, but CONFIG_PARAVIRT is not
3. Set paravirt ops only if the platform has capability to recognize
   paravirtualized irq operations
4. Update apic_is_clustered_box() to indicate unsynched TSCs on multiboard
   vSMPowered systems
The patches have been tested against 2.6.25-rc5-mm1 on vSMPowered and non
vSMPowered x86 boxes.
Please apply
Thanks,
Kiran
