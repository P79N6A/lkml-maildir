OK - I suspected something like this.  Most Dell computers don't support
ExpressCard hotplug using Native PCIe -- in fact, I've not seen a single
one, they explicitly disable it because they have not validated it or
they have and something didn't work right.  I'll take a look at what you've
got, but be aware that you are forcing pciehp to load and operate on a system
where they've certainly either not tested it, or tested it and something
bad happened.
