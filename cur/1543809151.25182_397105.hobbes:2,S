Storing uid/gid values on the filesystem is not always good.  Imagine
that you need to work with the same removable media on different
machines, where you have accounts with different uids; in this case
uid/gid values stored on one machine have no meaning everywhere else.
It would be good to have a mount option for UDF which turns off the
uid/gid handling completely and shows all files on the filesystem with
uid/gid specified by mount options.
