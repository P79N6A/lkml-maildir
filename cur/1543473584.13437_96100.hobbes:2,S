This is just small stuff and tidying. It should fix most of the reported oops
cases.
Changes for -ac4
o	Fix the Cyrix 6x86 problem pre2 introduced
o	Fix the IDE crash report
o	Fix IDE Geometry bug (Andre)
o	Fix soundblaster funnies (Mike Galbraith)
o	Move AUTOINIT into dma.h (Russ King)
o	SMP locking for DE4x5 (David Davies)
Changes for -ac3
o	Fixed SMP compile problem
o	i2c_init warning removed
o	epic100 now counts bytes (Nolan)
o	wavefront update (Paul Barton Davies)
	| This should now work on pentium and faster boxes
o	Ptrace fixes (Linus)

	| Geometry for >8Gig
	| Don't start with multimode on
	| Even if the BIOS says UDMA for known problem drives, turn it off
	| for WD AC11000H, 22100H, 32500H and 33100H
	| Misordered DMA stop, status check - causes some peoples drives
	| to do interestingly bad things
o	Fix accidentally reversed rpc time wrap fix (Matti Aarnio)
Fixed in -ac patches  (* = sent on to Linus)
For Linus:
o	AVL tree vm avoids bad perfomance problems
o	MediaGX crashes on boot
o	Certain numbers of scsi disks dont seem to work
*	VFS clears setuid/gid flags wrongly on directories
*	COSA credited twice
*	string.h egcs fixes
*	Some further time fixes
*	Various time fixes submitted
*	KNFSD patches. With them knfsd seems to work ok. With the current
	tree it doesnt work at all. Probably this is "Experimental for 2.2"
o	AMD stepping ident, K6 ident
o	What the hell is going on in time.c, on a low memory box picking
	586 gives better performance for a 486 and several other chips
	without TSC registers. That patch piece is a bad way to save 1K
*	Various config combinations don't build
*	FTAPE doesnt work in .132/2.2.0pre
*	Various of the time_* changes to net/* are one out
o	Ted's last serial patch is missing (setserial crashes box)
*	IBMMCA doesnt work on the model 77 internal scsi
o	Trond's last NFS fix
*	include/linux/sysctl.h is exposed to user tasks even with glibc,
	but isnt strictly ANSI compliant
*	SYS5 shm debugging slows stuff down measurably -ifdef it
*	DVD isofs trips an iso bug trap wrongly.
Unsure:
o	Large file array support (will be required by vendors for several
	big name products). This is a tricky one. Im wearing too many hats
	to judge this objectively. Vendors will probably ship this anyway
	or something similar.
Linus doesnt want:
o	QlogicFC - no big problem, its seperate its clean and vendors
	can ship it and other driver addons easily as they do now. Its a 
	nobrainer to install of the net.
Stale ?:
o	ADFS updates
o	Load unversioned modules into versioned kernels when doing
	request_module etc.
