How about two patches, one renaming kmem_cache_free to
kmem_cache_free_fast or __kmem_cache_free or whatever pleases you most,
the second adding kmem_cache_free with a NULL check.
The point is that the easiest way to use kmem_cache_free should be the
safest, but not necessarily the fastest.  Existing well-tuned and
NULL-aware code paths can remain fast, random new code will be safe.
