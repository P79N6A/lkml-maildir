But, to avoid confusion, the inclusion of a crytocompress plugin in a
given kernel doesn't mean that all files accessed from that kernel are
encrypted and compressed.  It just means that you can pick an individual
file and set it to be transparently encrypted/compressed.
That is what I meant by "enabled".  Not per-user, but per-file.
