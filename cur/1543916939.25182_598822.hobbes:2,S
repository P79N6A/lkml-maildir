Hmmm... I always thought the queue was because the condition can change
inbetween waking up and actually running.  For example, if the condition
is !(queue empty), another task can enter the critical section and
consume the element which triggered wake up before the woken up task do.
I have no problem with changing the condition check to loop but it would
be great if someone can point me to a code where this unexpected wake up
is used.
Thanks.
