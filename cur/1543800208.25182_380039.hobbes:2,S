Beware this one.  The CFI code is not realistically ever used with 
everything set to y in real life scenarios.  In fact, when only the 
needed buswidth and interleave option are selected then this particular 
inlined function gets reduced to a simple constant, such as 0x00700070 
for example.
However if gcc wasn't forced to always inline, then in the allyesconfig 
this function would benefit from being uninlined automatically.
