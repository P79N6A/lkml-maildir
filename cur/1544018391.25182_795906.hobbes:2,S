This won't work because ops also specify non-memory accessors ops
(i.e. enable_dma, set_clock, ...), so we can't just assign
default_ops ptr.

Yeah, I didn't even bother w/ measuring. ;-)

This will work. Pierre, what do you think? That way drivers
will call this routine instead of "host->ops = driver_ops_ptr".
The other option would be to remove const from the ops. Or implement
another non-const ops struct (struct sdhci_io_ops?).
In any way, the type-checked variant will be even longer to type:
host->mem_ops->writel(val, host->ioaddr + reg);
host->ops.writel(val, host->ioaddr + reg);
host->writel(val, host->ioaddr + reg);
Thanks,
