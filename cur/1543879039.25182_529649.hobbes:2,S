Seems to be related to lguest. Ask Rusty :)

Take a look at do_futex().
Adding checks in callers just increase code size. I tried this got only bad results.
This would speedup only the slow path (ie when some user code want to give us non aligned addrs)
A single factorized check is cleaner and not slower, since we reduce icache pressure.
