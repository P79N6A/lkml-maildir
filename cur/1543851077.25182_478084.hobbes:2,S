Ok, I've done a bisection which came back to:
    gregkh-driver-mem-devices
But as it seems somewhat nonsensical I'll submit two tests one with that
backed out and one with the patch below backed out:
    gregkh-driver-network-device
Results should be out on TKO in a few hours.  Will report back tommorrow
in detail.
