Excellent same file.  Where'd you come across it?  And do you have any
other 2.x libc lying around?  Looks like the collection on your site has
a couple I'm missing from 4.x series.  I have an old FTP archive on my
machine from back a ways, but its missing 4.2 4.1 and earlier libc
versions, do you have them anywhere as   Or better yet, the filenames of
the archives they might be in, as I might already have them and just
don't know it ;-)
