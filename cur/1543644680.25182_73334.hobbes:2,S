Maybe - I've been thinking of a "hotplug" daemon, that can take notifications 
from the kernel _and_ from other userspace apps. The integrated solution 
somehow needs to incorporate device hotplugging (eg USB, PCI), network device 
events (netlink), userspace reconfiguration (eg X colour depth and 
resolution) and maybe network infrastructure (external to the machine, 
probably SLPv2 or similar), and reconfigure kernel and applications to match.
