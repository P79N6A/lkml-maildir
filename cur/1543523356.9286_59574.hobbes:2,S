I agree with larry. I haven't said anything because I have so patiently
been waiting for hard results. I most interested in the the results of
wake_up. It seems to make logical sense that instead of waking up all the
process and then putting all but the best one to sleep instead wake up the
best process and keep the others sleeping would give better results. Only
benchmarks will tell.
