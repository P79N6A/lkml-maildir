Hi
The complete console log can be found at 
http://haylott.plus.com/~robbie/md-oops.txt
hde is a failed drive. In this log, hdg (the other drive in the raid1
array) is not present. This oops also occurs when hdg is present. I
don't know why it tries to use hde when it has been failed for some
time now.  This doesn't occur with 2.6.8 (also a debian kernel). I
don't have a log of the oops when hdg was present, but I can provide
one if necessary.
Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide to
help to debug this.  For now I have removed hde and everything is
working fine.
Best regards
Rob
