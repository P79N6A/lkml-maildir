This patch fixed it.
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/13/204
The ELF core dump code has one use of off_t when
writing out segments.  Some
of the segments may be passed the 2GB limit of an
off_t, even on a 32-bit
system, so it's important to use loff_t instead.  This
fixes a corrupted
core dump in the bigcore test in GDB's testsuite.
