It costs a little bit more, but it will be part of the 'past holiday special'. 
As an intermediate step I incresed the voltages of the ram - looks good so 
far.

you mean like playing ut2004 with reduced fans or several instances of 
cpuburn, or compiling something big like kdepim with kdeenablefinal? Done all 
that ...

yeah, it would be the least annoying variant. After one PSU ate two computers, 
this one is just two and a half month old  -  I had my share of bad PSUs. 
That is why I increased the voltages. Maybe it helps.

still this would show up with the temps. And the temps are ok.
Glück Auf,
