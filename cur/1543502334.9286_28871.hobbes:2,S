s/capabilities/icons/ I presume, given the context.
Yes, it would work, and wouldn't require any changes... for ELF
executables.  There are still shell/Perl/Python/Tcl/you-name-it scripts
to deal with, however --- not to mention icons for files.  (The OS/2
model uses the .ICO-with-same-rootname mechanism for scripts etc., with
executables having their default icons as resources; EAs are used for
user-assigned icons.)  This problem also came up with capabilities, you
may recall.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
