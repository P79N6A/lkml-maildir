Thanks for that. I missed it. Apologies to the list for not looking more 
before I threw the toys. Also thanks to michal@harddata.com who gave the 
one that works for the Thinkpad.
In case anyone else is looking, the r50p will resume from S3 when
acpi_sleep=s3_bios
is specified as a boot option.
Shame about the ATI drivers not restoring, but XOrg's X server works 
like a charm (Apart from no hardware 3D acceleration for the FireGL-T2). 
Still, I suppose I don't have a tainted kernel any more :)
