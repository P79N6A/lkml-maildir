This should be fixed. But just as a note, we can tolerate some removed
timer values values as it would be just an extra timer interrupt.

OK. How can we get the first event in nanoseconds easily?

Needs to be fixed then.

Good point. Needs to be fixed.

We really should fix this for 2.6.16. Then maybe after 2.6.16 we can
convert next_timer_interrupt() to return nanosecond instead of jiffies.
And then we can get rid of jiffies again in the hrtimer code :)
