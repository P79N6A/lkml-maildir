Nah, competition would be good. :-)
I think it would be best to have both a _press_ release and
a more technical announcement. Your stuff is the latter.

Woah, STOP! Clearly you are a geek, nerd, or techie.
Generally, it is bad to mention bug fixes in public.
Bug fixes imply buggy software. Did you ever wonder why
Microsoft doesn't feature hotfix updates on their main web
page? Even Red Hat has picked up a clue about this.

Politics have no place here.

This didn't make it. :-(

LINUX KERNEL 2.2
Santa Clara CA, January XX, 1999
Today the software developers led by Linus Torvalds release a major update
to the Linux operating system. This update brings increased scalability,
new hardware support, and a large collection of low-level features.
Highlights include:
* Advanced network routing and WAN support, which gives Linux the
  ability to replace many expensive proprietary network devices.
  Users can take control of their intranet with priority traffic,
  usage limits, accounting, and virtual private networks. Strong
  128-bit encryption is available as an add-on component.
* Enterprise-level network filesystem support, complete with data
  replication for performance, mobility, and extreme reliability.
* Video capture support, TV tuner support, simplified audio support,
  and other multimedia enhancements.
* Support for a large variety of parallel port devices including
  disk drives, tape drives, and other easy-to-use external devices.
* Greater performance, especially while under heavy load or while
  running on computers with multiple processors.
* Compatibility support for reading BSD and NT disks. Easy access to
  documents stored on NTFS-format disks will facilitate conversion
  from NT to Linux.
Advanced technical users are already using this update, downloaded
from the Internet. Business users can get a fully supported copy later
this spring when Linux vendors ship complete integrated systems
containing the update on easy-to-use CD-ROM distributions.
Linux is a secure network operating system for demanding users.
It interoperates well with a wide variety of other systems.
Linux can take advantage of modern PC and PowerMac hardware or give
new life to older 486-based computers. Support is widely available
via both traditional contracts and cost-effective Internet groups.
Linux is provided under an unlimited-use license that lets users
make in-house customizations to the system itself. Initial estimates
suggest that Linux had 10 to 20 million users at the end of 1998.
Linus Torvalds, native to Finland, lives with his family in Santa
Clara CA, USA. He and others created Linux as a labor of love,
which may account for the superior software quality.

Apple Computer, Inc. NT is a trademark of Northern Telecom Limited.
