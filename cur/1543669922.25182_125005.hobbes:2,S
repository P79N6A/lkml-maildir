	Yes, and I support this 100%.

	Sure, but it's a marshall, not a reality.  One of the reasons
for choosing 64bits is that we can have large spaces for large things.
If a driver happens to get a number in the 16:16 space (or the 12:20
space, which I prefer as well), then it could run out of space and end
up with the multiple major problem.
	True, a truly dynamic scheme could make all of this irrelevant,
but I was just postulating that complexity isn't strictly necessary.
	I guess it is a trade off.  Do all devices greater than 8:8
become 32:32 and merely are masked to 16:16 on limited filesystems, or
do all devices smaller than 16:16/12:20 appear the same on all
filesystems, limited or not?
