The only corruption that has been reported is from people who have
moved their files (taken backup for instance).  Since we currently use
the physical block number as initialization vector when encrypting a
block, the loopback file can't be moved.  When it is moved, there will
be _total_ corruption - nothing will decrypt correctly. There is a
workaround described in the Documentation/crypto/faq.txt file.
