Subject: raid over sata - write barrier

I've found that ext3 + sata + kernel 2.6.12 supports the write barrier mount
option (-o barrier=1)
(found it here: 
http://marc.10east.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112019898711806
)
is write barrier supported with RAID (md) over sata, with ext3? (which
kernel version?)
(or we have to disable write cache in HD in this case?)
thanks
