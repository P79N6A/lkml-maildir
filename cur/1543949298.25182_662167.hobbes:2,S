Yes, that's bad, but I don't see any other solution at the moment (see below).

If new children get registered when the parent is suspended, that's already
wrong, because the children should have been suspended before.  Think of a case
when the parent is a bus and the children are devices on it.  In that case, by
suspending the parent before the children we can make the children
unresponsive etc. (that would break the PCI PM rules, for one example).

In fact we don't.  We only know that suspend_device() has won the race with
the device registration.

I don't agree with that (not only because the last sentence is oversimplified ;-)).
I think that the rule "the driver must not register new children after
->suspend() has run" is not a good one, because in fact we don't want
->suspend() to be called while new children are being registered.  IMO, we
should make the rule that "device registration may fail if it's carried out
concurrently with the parent's ->suspend() method".  At least, that will tell
the drivers what to do or avoid.

I don't agree with that too.

I agree it's not a good idea to hold the locks throughout the entire cycle,
but that can be overcome if we use an additional variable under
dev_pm_info (see patch below).

Still, I think we can fail them.
In fact, drivers _should_ check for device_add() failures and if they don't,
it's a plain bug.

Well, I think it's not correct to allow the parent to suspend with active (not
suspended) children.

I agree.  What I was trying to say is that the core should protect itself, to
the maximum reasonable extent possible, from suspending a parent before the
children which may lead to some subtle problems.

On the systems I'm talking about there are some devices referred to by the
ACPI _PTS method, so they must be on line whey this method is being executed.
Since we don't know a priori what devices they are, we must put all devices on
line (into the full power state) before executing _PTS.

Well, that's correct.  However, if we make the rule that device_add() may fail
if it's run concurrently with the parent's ->suspend(), the changes of the
drivers need not be substantial (they should check for the failures of
device_add() anyway).
[BTW, there is a bug in the error path of device_add() for which I'm going to
send a fix later today.  Namely, in case of a BusError, dpm_sysfs_remove()
is executed after device_pm_remove() which calls dpm_sysfs_remove().]
Below is the current version of the patch for handling device registrations
in the PM core.  In this version, the new registrations are failed if done too
late (or too early) and the locks are not held during the entire suspend/resume
cycle.
The patch is against the mainline with
http://marc.info/?l=linux-acpi&m=120389632114090&w=2
and your fix applied and has been (slightly) tested on x86-64.
Thanks,
Rafael
