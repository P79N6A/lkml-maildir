yeah andrew it works! you are god!!
while i got you here, i have got a pray more for you.
its about amd64-agp. i never had it working (from 2.6.1 mm and vanilla)
but in 2.6.4-rc1-mm2 it worked! but sadly abit unstable :(
my big problem is that when using X, and having some windows opens, it
consumes ALL cpu if amd64-agp isnt in kernel, so i would REALLY
apreciate if you could look at it (sorry my bad english)
thanks!
