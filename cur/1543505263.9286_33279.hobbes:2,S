Hi Werner et al.,
how  about dropping  the  boot and  setup code  from  the kernel  entirely?
Just  move the  whole  stuff to  the  bootloader  (as it  used  to be  done
with  commercial Unices  on PC's)  and  have it  setup the  whole 32Bit  PM
environment, load the (possibly zipped)  vmlinux binary (not necessarily in
this order), pass  the config options on the command  line (or through some
reserved memory) and execute it.
Thus we would no longer need as86/ld86  to build the kernel (see the thread
about  this  topic)  and building  the  kernel  would  be  the same  as  on
SPARC/MIPS/ALPHA...
The next step then would be to merge MILO(Alpha), MILO(Mips), LILO and SILO
(Werner.  we  talked about  that  over  dinner  back at  Linux-Kongress  in
Würzburg, remember?) into  a common bootloader for  all architectures. That
should  make life  a  bit  easier for  the  distributors and  documentation
authors ...
Are there any _REAL_ problems that would prevent this?
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
