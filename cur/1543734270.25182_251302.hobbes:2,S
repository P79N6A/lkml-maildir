Hi all.
I wrote a module to trace the instructions executed by the kernel
to service a system call. Its just a eflags setting bit at the start of
the syscall handler and a debug handler that increments a counter.
The thing is that the syscalls are sometimes taking more or less
instructions to execute. Why is that? Is it expected? Or a probably
made a mistake?
TIA,
Fabiano
