I've got a similar setup, and while I don't know if it spews packets it
does spew errors.  It stops spewing errors when the card is manually set
to promiscuous mode (ifconfig eth1 promisc).  It's been happening since
at least 2.1.124 (the first kernel that I booted on this machine).  If the
errors and spewing are related, setting it promisc might help.
