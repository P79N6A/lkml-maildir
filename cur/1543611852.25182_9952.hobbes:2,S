I was looking for code to cleanup and found these warnings:
(from 2.4.17-pre2)
dmi_scan.c:195: warning: `disable_ide_dma' defined but not used
agpgart_be.c:524: warning: `agp_generic_create_gatt_table' defined but
not used
agpgart_be.c:652: warning: `agp_generic_free_gatt_table' defined but not
used
agpgart_be.c:700: warning: `agp_generic_insert_memory' defined but not
used
agpgart_be.c:758: warning: `agp_generic_remove_memory' defined but not
used
parport_pc.c:1784: warning: `parport_ECP_supported' defined but not used
Are these functions supposed to be there or are they leftovers from
previous modifications.
Thanks,
Sean Jones
