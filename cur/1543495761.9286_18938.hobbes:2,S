I will comment on this in private.

I first understood what you mean when I read your specification. You mean
that unlink() refuses to delete files which are marked as being required
by the package manager.
I must admit, the idea is very nice, but this means hard work. The first
thing to think about is how to handle startup/shutdown situations where
filesystems might not be available ("mount" and "umount" modify files in
/etc, which basically means writing a new one and unlink()ing the old). A
journaled filesystem would make things easier here (if the database is not
available, only schedule files for removal).

You haven't even looked at the source yet, have you?
