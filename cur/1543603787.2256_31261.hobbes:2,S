How do you know it? I showed a simple case where it may happen.

I hope you don't want to count probability that the server will or won't
crash (yes, crash, because when poll in main loop fails, the server
process has not many choices - it can only terminate itself). This reminds
me some Microsoft announcement saying that Windows NT are 3 times more
stable than Windows 95 :-) 
And it does happen - see this:

Maybe probability was reduced somehow, but the problem is still there.
