no, there is not.
Actualy, I was looking at __request_region after I sent the previous
message.
What'd be the proper way to fix request_region for no dynamic bus
sizing platform?  use #ifdef in linux/ioport.h and call
__request_region twice or fix __request_region?
how about something like this? (haven't even compile)
#define ADDR_OFFSET(x) WHATEVER(x)
#define request_region(start,n,name) \
      ({ struct resource * __r, __s;                                                           \
         __r  = __request_region(&ioport_resource, (start), (n), (name));                      \
         if (__r) {                                                                            \
                 __s = __request_region(&ioport_resource, (ADDR_OFFSET(start)), (n), (name));  \
                 if (!__s) {                                                                   \
                         __release_region(&ioport_resource, (start), (n), (name));             \
                         __r = NULL;                                                           \
                 }                                                                             \
         }                                                                                     \
         __r; })
