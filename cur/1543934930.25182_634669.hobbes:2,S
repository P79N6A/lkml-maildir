Hi
This patchset converts macros related to super_block into
functions. Besides that it fixes some sparse warnings (6th),
improves coding style (1st) and fixes error handling (4th).
Note that udf files has really long lines and these patches won't
validate by checkpatch. Next patchset will clean it up almost completely.
(Only 3rd patch changed from second version)
