I usually don't post much, but this OOM/Quota talk has caught my attention.
Something direly needed around here.  Were using some large Linux servers,
6+ CPU, and this is a big problem.

I thought about doing this a while back, but never found time to get past
testing.  My idea was as follows:
1. Create system call, sys_rquotactl.  Call will 1) Set/remove quotas,
2)report current quota when called with a predefined UID as an argument. By
quotas I mean a mimimum garenteed amount, and a maximum threshold.
2.  Write user space program to set and report quotas at boot time, based on
configuration file.
When resources are requested, the quota is checked, if the user will go
over,  OOM error is returned and the allocation request fails, if the system
is above a predefined load, or if a higher "priority" user needs the memory.
I had actually made most of the changes to do this about 3 months ago, if I
can find the source, I'll send it along.

Better yet, use a default quota.  All users fit a certain group, unless
explicitly changed.
 In my opinion, quotas shouldn't be truly enforced until the system reaches
a certain state.  Before OOM hits, but after a preconfigured acceptable
threshold.  Very much a long the lines of HP's Process Resource Manager for
HPUX.  This way, if a user with a low quota logs in at 2am, and no one else
is using the system, they have full access to the system's resources.  Then,
if a more privelaged user logs in and needs the space that the
"not-so-important" user is using, he is gets what he's garenteed via quotas.
