SuSE has already done this, so it's nothing new.

You'll get a line number too. At least it's a compile-time
error, instead of a quiet data-corrupting run-time error.

Nope. That breaks more code than necessary.

Nope. Executables need to run on multiple kernels.

Nope. This is silent data corruption.
You'll break stuff like this:   P_rss *= (PAGE_SIZE/1024);
