Ah, right.

I read Documentation/initrd.txt and I don't understand it.  If I
understand it right, I have to build a complete root filesystem with all
the stuffs necessary for mounting the second (real) root filesystem.  If
I'm loading the kernel from floppy, then I only have 200k to work with.
I'll try initrd.txt, step by step over the holidays.
