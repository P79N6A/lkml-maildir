Yes, from the user-space pov it may be not true, but ->group_leader->real_parent
should be equal ->real_parent anyway.

How so? Note that release_task() doesn't call put_task_struct(), it does
call_rcu(&p->rcu, delayed_put_task_struct) instead. When delayed_put_task_struct()
is called, all CPUs must see the new value of ->real_parent (otherwise
RCU is just broken). If CPU sees the old value of ->real_parent, rcu_read_lock()
protects us from delayed_put_task_struct() on another CPU.
Ok, I think this is the same "classic" pattern as:
	old = global_ptr;
	global_ptr = new;
	call_rcu(..free_old...);
vs
	rcu_read_lock();
	use(global_ptr);
	rcu_read_unlock();
Do you agree?
Oleg.
