IMHO cachefs is a big deal particularly now that the NFSv4 delegation 
code has been merged.
For those unfamiliar with the changes from NFSv3 -> NFSv4, one of the 
many nice features of v4 is that it has sane caching.  A file can be 
"delegated" to the client, such that, the client has complete control 
over the file including caching.  Sorta like a lease.  Great for 
cachefs, IOW.  :)
