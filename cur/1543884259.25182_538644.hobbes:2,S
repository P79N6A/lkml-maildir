Indeed; in fact it would be easier to do per-thread accounting than
our current per-process accounting, as you note.

The question is should we use setrlimit() to set the per-thread CPU
limit, given that we would need some separate interface to set signal
that should be sent.  
Is there any reason why we should have the interface specify whether
the signal should be directed to a specified process or kernel
thread-id, perhaps using si_pid field in the siginfo_t to specify
which thread had exceeded its CPU limit.  Or would this be overkill?

Yep, I agree that thread cancellation is the right thing to happen at
the Posix Threads level.
Do you think this is something that we could get standardized into an
upcoming Posix/Posix Threads standard?
