For kobjects that are not ever registered with sysfs?  Those kobjects
never create dentries, so yes, this is unneeded.  For an example of this
kind of usage, see the drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c file.  I know the
scsi people are also looking into using kobjects in this manner for some
of their internal structures.  
I would also like to use kobjects this way for all USB urbs, but they
are too heavy in their existing footprint for this to work out.  And by
adding this extra overhead, there's no way I could advocate using
kobjects for them in the future :(
thanks,
