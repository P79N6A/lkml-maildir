True...it's just that you normally expect _better_ performance when
increasing the size of the transfer. I'm just afraid that someone might
start tuning things elsewhere, only to find that crossing a certain
threshold gives a drastic reduction in performance. That would be
completely counter-intuitive.

Right. And if we insert the interrupt descriptor somewhere in the
middle instead of at the end, we should be able to submit a new batch
of descriptors before the previous batch is exhausted, thus maintaining
maximum throughput without any pauses.
I'll probably keep it simple at first though. Gotta save some
optimizations for later ;)
