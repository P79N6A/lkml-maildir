There has never been any confusion. The slop bits are treated
consistently as "don't cares". The functions used to inspect the values,
bitmap_empty(), bitmap_full(), bitmap_equal(), and bitmap_weight(), all
properly check the boundary cases. The remaining functions clobber the
slop bits without hesitation in order to simplify the implementation,
as those bits are never examined by the inspection functions.
If those bits are ever examined and interpreted when they should not be,
I'd be far more interested in hearing about that than about don't cares
being clobbered when they are supposed to be.
