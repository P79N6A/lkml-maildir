Interestingly, I notice Zwane had a very similiar oops, posted on the
7th: Oops in __journal_clean_checkpoint_list
He also had preempt enabled...
I've found upgrading my Debian system using dselect to be a *very* good

If you have candidates, I'll try to test them - I've typically had no
problem reproducing the issue :)
