If other people waits for us it's ok (if they waits it means they're not
using GFP_NOIO and they're also not using GFP_NOHIGHIO).
We cannot wait on other two people doing it since they would be highmem
pages and the pagehighmem check forbids that.

I don't think it's necessary.

GFP_NOIO is a no brainer, it cannot go wrong see the other email.
