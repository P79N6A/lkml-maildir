Indeed, the kernel tree in my case is in my home directory so it
would be bugly (butt-ugly) to have symlinks from /usr/include to my
home directory, wouldn't it ?
I think that kernel header files should be handled along with and in the same
way as System.map, .config, zImage and modules, all copied and installed
together.
