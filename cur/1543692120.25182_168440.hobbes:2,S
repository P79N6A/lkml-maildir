Are you are kidding?  Arch is _insanely_ good at handling both
distributed repositories and merging -- those are if anything its
greatest strengths.  Everyday development of tla (the latest/greatest
arch implementation) involves many people with their own repositories,
merging back and forth.
Really, if you have explicit complaints/observations about arch's
handling of these things, please share them, because on the surface
that statement just seems kind of bizarre.
