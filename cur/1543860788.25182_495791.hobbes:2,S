Example code showing this weirdness?

If something like this happened, programs would be crashing left and right.

Define "system-level code". What makes it different from, say,
bog-of-the-mill compiler code (yes, gcc compiles itself as part of its
sanity checking)?

If the related segments show code that is somehow wrong, by all means
report it /with your detailed analysis/ to the compiler people. Just a
warning, gcc is pretty smart in what it does, its code is often surprising
to the unwashed. Also, the C standard is subtle, the error might be in a
unwarranted assumption in the source code.
