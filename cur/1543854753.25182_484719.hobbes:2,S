I've got one that prevents gcc from inlining single use functions in XFS
that I need to finish off, and that results in some significant stack
usage reductions in some XFS functions.
However, XFS is only one part of the picture - when you put NFS on top,
DM+md then scsi/FC below and then you nest a soft irq that might go
20 functions deep as well - then 4k stacks simply aren't big enough.

Most of the low hanging fruit is already gone. The problem we are
facing now for further reductions in stack usage is the fact that we
need to factor code. That is a major undertaking and has a _lot_ of
risk associated with it....

That's one of the few remaining low hanging fruit, and that's fixed
in the patches I already have.

Well, we don't need that many, but it would be nice to have a
set of unique traces that lead to overflows - could you process
them in some way just to extract just the unique XFS traces that
occur?
Cheers,
Dave.
