> 1.  inetd will notice any changes to inetd.conf automaticlly.
   I must be to used to other Unix systems where inetd must be
restarted.. on Solaris, and AIX any changes to the /etc/services
or /etc/inetd.conf required a reboot.. restarting inetd never
worked, or if it did telnet sessions start to flake out..
   from what I am hearing Linux uses FM where inetd is
concerned.. it has never recognized any of my changes
automagically.. thou it usually does a better job at when
restarted than AIX, and Solaris, I have still had times where
rebooting was the only solution..

  okay.. well then someone suggest me a good UPS with ALL of the
following criteria:
     1) must work with both NT and Linux, in the event that I
ever boot to NT again (rare but those damm word files make me do
it) not reading then writing them..
     2) easy to configure under both Linux and NT
     3) 10 to 15 minutes reserve power .. my power just flashes
occasionally, but has gone out for several hours
     4) if power goes out the system must know that power is
gone and shut itself down (apmd? or some dameon)
     5) must be SMP friendly (shouldn't make a difference)
     6) around $100..
Joe
