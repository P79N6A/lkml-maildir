Tried it. Well, the good news is that now I can use correctly the serial
console. I discovered that if I use 
   console=ttyS0,115200n8 
all the message goes through the cable... but if I add (as per documentation)
console=tty0 too, something goes to the serial console and something no...
but well, I can live with it. 
The bad news is that with 2.6.12-rc1 (no preempt) swsusp fails to go. The
all thing that can capture the serial console is:

[4294821.492000] Stopping tasks:
===============================================================================|
[4294821.505000] Freeing memory... done (44548 pages freed)
And then stops dead. One thing I noticed: the "rotating bar" is now much
more slow than before (although the total time before "done" is not changed
a lot, it seems). Could be a hint? 
the full log (42k) is here
http://www.dea.icai.upco.es/romano/linux/swsusp/2612-rc1.log
I tried with init=/bin/bash, same thing, here: 
http://www.dea.icai.upco.es/romano/linux/swsusp/2612-rc1-2nd.log
To compare, this is a full log of boot, suspend and successful resume 
with 2.6.11:
http://www.dea.icai.upco.es/romano/linux/swsusp/2611-rg.log
it's not vanilla, it has the following patch applied, but I tested with and
without it and nothing change (that is, all is OK in this kernel)
http://www.dea.icai.upco.es/romano/linux/config-2.6.11-rg/patch-no3851.id4516
Well... what can I do now (apart doing some real work)? I can try to debug
why 2.6.11 with preempt fail, or continue on 2.6.12? I am willing to help!
Thank you for your help,
          Romano
