A few milliseconds is acceptable. Presumably that is under some stress
workload? What we'd really like is to be able to gang-hotplug CPUs to
amortise the freezer overhead.
This initial patchset does not include save/restore support anyway, so in
fact it would be consistent to have CONFIG_PREEMPT configurable. I'm sure
that we are going to have some nasty bugs to fix up as a result, but we
can't fix them until we find them! Then we can convert our save/restore code
to use the freezer before submitting it for inclusion.
