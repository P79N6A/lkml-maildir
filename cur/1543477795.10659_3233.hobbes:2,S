I did.  I don't know about Gerard's driver, but mine specifically does print
out whenever a device that we set up as tagged queueing capable rejects part
of our tagged queueing operation.  That's what prompted that change.  As for
the version issue, most drives in a single family respond identically.  If
Gerard can confirm that your drive was actually using tagged queueing and that
the driver didn't silently disable it, then we can change this around.
