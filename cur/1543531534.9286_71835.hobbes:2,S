This has been discussed in great detail on NANOG when AOL wanted to sue Paul
Vixie. 
The result is nil. 
It is your ISP policy. By accepting the service and the EUL and AUP you have
signed to it as is. If you do not like ISPs that do not like SPAM go to another
ISP (and risk people not reading your email at all seeing your address).

      No matter how many reporters share a cab, and no
