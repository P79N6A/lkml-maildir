Just tried that, no effect...  :-(
Something must be strangely different between the way 2.6.x tries to
reboot the System and any other Kernel-version does.  Who is the
Maintainer of this code?  Or maybe even better, who did the changes,
made to the reboot-code in 2.6?  (There is a ne file reboot.c, but
without any author notice)
Please cc me in any reply, I'm not subscribed to the lkml.
