The one problem with noatime is that mutt's 'new mail arrived' breaks
as you mentioned in the relatime changelog, so I'm surprised that
they turned it on by default.  With relatime fixing that however,
I'm also unaware of anything that breaks.   I'd be curious to
do a Fedora test release with relatime, but I know the answer I'll
get when I recommend we add it to our generated fstabs..
"If it's good enough, why isn't it the kernel default"
Hence my current line of questioning ;-)
