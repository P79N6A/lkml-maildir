Good so far.  When you have one value in a file the filename
tells you what it is.  What i don't want to see is more of
the multiple values in a file without labels or headings.
eg. /proc/sys/fs/inode-state (2.4.18):
	1792	133	0	0	0	0	0
I can't really trust documentation to keep up so the only
way i can be sure what these numbers are, is to look in the
kernel source.
Please, if you must have multiple values give them labels.
If it can only be 1 dimensional put one per line with a
label.  I don't care whether whether it 'label text:  value'
or 'label_text=value'  just as long as we are consistent
about the delimiters, capitalization (don't), whitespace and
underscore/dash.
If it needs to be 2 dimensional put the labels at the top as
a comment line (/^[;#]/d).  Using fixed width fields is asking
for trouble.  I prefer tab delimited but padding the fields
for alignment is OK as would be using tabs as long as we
agree on method and the labels don't have spaces.
