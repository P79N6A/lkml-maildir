Then it might be static.

Too many different changes according to the name of the patch.

Ok, it still might be atomic as a variable change, but it will break scenarios
such as
mutex_lock(&nsp->smk_lock);
create(nsp->smk_inode);
cook_a_dinner();
get_info(nsp->smk_inode);
mutex_unlock(&nsp->smk_lock);
While cook_a_dinner(), smack_inode_setsecurity() is called and the attribute
changed...
Doesn't this matter?
