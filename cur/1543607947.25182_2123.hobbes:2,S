   My _preferred_ approach would actually be to move the slab pages to the
   LRU list too, and have a special "slab" address space (we don't need to
   actually hash them, we just make page->mapping point to it), and have the
   cache shrink be done naturally as part of writepage().
This is a cool idea.
So when a SLAB block gets allocated from, we "reference" the
underlying page?
Franks a lot,
