 aspex microelectronics 4096 2-bit massively parallel SIMD
 processor (does 1 terabit-ops / sec @ 250mhz which sounds a
 lot until you try to do FPU emulation on it).
 each 2-bit processor has 256 bits of content-addressable memory,
 which can be 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit addressed (to make 4096 parallel
 memory searches - in a single cycle).
 absolutely friggin blindingly fast for certain issues (video
 processing, certain kinds of audio processing - e.g. FFTs,
 XML and HTTP parsing), and pissed all over for others such
 as doing floating point arithmetic.
 but anyway: that's a side issue.  thanks for reminding me about CAM,
 valdis.
