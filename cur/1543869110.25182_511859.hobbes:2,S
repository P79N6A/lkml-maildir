Yes. In fact that's my solution!
The problem is that "pps_handle_t" is forced by the RFC to be a scalar
and _not_ a generic (and opaque) type. I suppose that since right now
such handler was simply the filedes of the serial/parallel port
connected with the GPS antenna. But this is not always the case. As
already told the GPS antenna can be connected with the serial line
while the PPS signal is not, so NTPD should always open the serial
port to read GPS data but it must not use such filedes for the
time_pps_create().
My support try to resolve this problem with minor changes in both RFC
and NTPD code.
Ciao,
Rodolfo
