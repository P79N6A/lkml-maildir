There is a USB WebCam called l'elegant by DigitalDreams. It is quite 
succesfull here in UK but it doesn't seem to be directly supported by the 
Linux Kernel. Can you redirect me to right module that may be compatible with 
it? Or let me know the address of the webcams maintainer, if there is any. 
Apologies for the off topic message.
