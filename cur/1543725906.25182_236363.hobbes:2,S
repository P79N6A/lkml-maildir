Hi there.
I do not seem to have success with tuning the max_sectors_kb value.
After setting it to 32 (the hw max is 128), userland programs fail with I/O
errors. Setting it back to 128 gets it back to working, sort of. The errors
probably get bufferred somewhere.
During the "bad" setting (32), messages like this one show up in kernel log.

I am using J7 voluntary_preemption patch (set at 2:1), cfq io scheduler,
via82cxxx IDE driver. I will gladly provide further details.
Rudo.
