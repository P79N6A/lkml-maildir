Why not something like:
struct list_node {
    struct list_node *prev;
    struct list_node *next;
}
struct list {
    struct list_node *prev;
    struct list_node *next;
}   
        
list_length(struct list *l)
list_add(struct list_node *new, struct list *head)
list_splice(struct list *list, struct list *head)
New:
#define list_sublist_from(node) ((struct list *)node)
So people would be forced to think if he is using a 'list_head'
as a node or as a sublist, and do the right casts to shut up the
compiler (that's why you can't do a typedef list_node list..., for
the compiler to scream...)
