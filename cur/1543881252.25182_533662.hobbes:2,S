afaik mutexes have the same behaviour as binary semaphores that are
used as mutexes (always locked and unlocked by the same
process/thread):
".. the semaphore type can officially be considered to be on its way
out. New code should not use semaphores, and old code which uses
semaphores as mutexes should be converted over when an opportunity
presents itself."
