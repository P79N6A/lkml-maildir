	Hello, Marco.
	Nice shot. Frankly, I had not noticed the "inconsistency". I guess that I 
suppossed that both were needed when I configured it.
	Jeff, could be this "dual driver" the reason of the crashes? Which driver 
should I choose for normal operation, the IDE or the libata one? If one of 
them is bit-rotting, maybe should be removed. But definitely a patch for 
Kconfig should clarify which driver is the right one.
	And, oh, almost forgot, would you accept a patch for adding "and Serial ATA" 
to the top "SCSI support" option? For a newbie is very difficult to find that 
SATA drivers are under SCSI support. I can send you a draft patch, if you 
want.
	Oh, and Nathan (if you are in charge of it), in the MAINTAINERS file there is 
an "owner-xfs@oss.sgi.com" address for XFS, that replies with an error, could 
you please either fix the address of fix the file? :-)
	Lots of questions for only one mail :-)
	Best regards,
		Ender.
