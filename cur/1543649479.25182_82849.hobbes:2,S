Using shared page tables all you'll waste is virtual space.
The shared page table for eg. /lib/libc.so will eventually
end up mapping all of the libc pages that are used by the
system's workload and processes won't pagefault on any libc
page that's already present in ram.
Sounds like a win/win solution, cutting down both on pagetable
overhead and on pagefaults.

Rik
