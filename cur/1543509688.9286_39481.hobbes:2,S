I'm not expert but I think that there isn't this file 
( tread pathed 2.2.10 -> 2.2.11 -> 2.2.12 ).
/usr/include/linux
is a symlink to 
/usr/src/linux/include/linux 
Isn't it ??? 
and 
/usr/include/asm
is a symlink to 
/usr/src/linux/include/asm-<your arch>
Isn't it ???
Sorry for trivial questions
Bye
