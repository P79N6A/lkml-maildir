Oh I should have explained this, missed it earlier. No, the
single-threadedness doesn't really matter for the problem, but the
warning Dave got couldn't possibly have triggered for a single-threaded
workqueue because it was from the CPU up/down code that spawns/stops the
new workqueue thread on a new/dying CPU.
