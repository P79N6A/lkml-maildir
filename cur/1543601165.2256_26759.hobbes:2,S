Thanks.
The configuring the ip_tables stuff after installing pcmcia-cs-3.1.29
seemed to screw things up a little.  The trick: Do pcmcia last.
I need ip_tables + wvlan_cs wireless from pcmcia-cs-3.1.29.
Solution:
cp .config /tmp; make clean; make mrproper; mv /tmp/.config .
make dep; make bzlilo; make modules; make modules_install
cd pcmcia-cs-3.1.29
make config; make all;
cd pcmcia-cs-3.1.29/wireless; make ; make install
