Greetings;
I just rebooted to 2.6.25.1, and was momentarily panic'd by the messages going by early in the boot, but on putting 2&2 
together, found they were just noise.
From dmesg:
[root@coyote ~]# dmesg|grep unable
[    2.093502] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 2
[    2.248475] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 5
[    2.454444] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 6
And lsusb:
[root@coyote ~]# lsusb

Indicating 3 empty ports, which is not correct either, but everything
that is plugged in is accounted for.  However, if there is no device
there, is it supposed to tell us?  In which case it should do that 2-3
more times in dmesg.
I realize this is picking minor nits. :)
Thanks.
