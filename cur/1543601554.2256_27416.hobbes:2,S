Look, the problem is that Linus is being an asshole and
integrating conflicting ideas into both the VM and the
VFS, without giving anybody prior notice and later blame
others.
Just look at how he's now trying to force Al Viro into
implementing his ideas yesterday because he broke stuff
again...
If you want a stable kernel, use Alan's kernel.
