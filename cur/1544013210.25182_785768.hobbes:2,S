Hi, kosaki-san.
I read the previous threads now. It's rather late :(.
I think it's rather awkward that sudden big change of order from 10 to 0.
This problem causes zone_water_mark's fail.
It mean now this zone's proportional free page per order size is not good.
Although order-0 page is very important, Shouldn't we consider other
order allocations ?
So I want to balance zone's proportional free page.
How about following ?
if (nr_reclaimed < SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX) {
   if (order != 0) {
     order -=1;
     sc.order -=1;
   }
}
It prevents infinite loop and do best effort to make zone's
proportional free page per order size good.
It's just my opinion within my knowledge.
If it have a problem, pz, explain me :)
