Alan et al,
I've got a hard lockup on 2.4.16 when I insmod sbp2 for my external
FW disk drive (ADS enclosure kit).  I'm not using the official RH 2.4.9-13
RPM because the SRPM didn't build an SMP kernel and I had been
having no problems with 2.4.16ctx-4  (that's with Jacques Gelinas'
vserver patch).  Anyhow, when I built  a new kernel to support my
new Via Firewire Card (SB-FW6306-3l),  I built it with the nesc.
ieee1394 support in modules.  However:
cd /lib/modules/2.4.16-ctx4/kernel/drivers/ieee1394
insmod ieee1394
insmod ohci1394
insmod raw1394
insmod sbp2    (HARD LOCKUP)
I can rebuild again with SysRq patch if you think that'll help.  I
can also forward my kernel build ".config" file and my sysreport
to Alan if he likes. (I've already sent a ticket to support@redhat.com.
about the SMP kernel problems.)
TIA
