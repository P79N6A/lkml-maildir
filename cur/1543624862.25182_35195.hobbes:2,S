I have modified kernel in a RedHat-7.2 and in the compilation I have not
had problem, but when resumption with kernel modified leaves the
following error to me:
request_module[block-major-8]: Root fs not mounted
VFS: Cannot open root device 08:03
Kernel panic:VFS:Unbale to mount root fs on 08:03
In which I have failed?
Thanks
Jose Luis
