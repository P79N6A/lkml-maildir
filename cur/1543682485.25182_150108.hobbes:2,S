I'm getting the same thing, with an ext3 root.  It seems that something
odd is happening in init/do_mounts.c, since from the message it looks
like ROOT_DEV isn't being initialized.  However the mm2 patch doesn't
seem to change anything significant-looking in this directory (just some
headers).  
Hm, on closer inspection, it resolves the device name by mounting sysfs,
rummaging around to see if the device exists and gets its device number
(0301 for hda1) and initializes ROOT_DEV from that.  I wonder if there's
a sysfs/block device breakage which makes the partitions not appear in
sysfs?  Setting root=0303 (in your case) might helps things along.
