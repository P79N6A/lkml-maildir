This is a good sign. Previously your computer was idle a lot going "where's
the data, hello ?, look is anyone going to serve me today". Now its getting
data faster so it should be doing more faster too.
You need to benchmark some things and see if the extra CPU is the scsi overhead
or the program getting work done faster
