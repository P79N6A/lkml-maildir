Andrew, please drop these patches:
	signals-send_signal-factor-out-signal_group_exit-checks.patch
	signals-fold-sig_ignored-into-prepare_signal.patch
	signals-document-cld_continued-notification-mechanics.patch
(the last one refers to prepare_signal() introduced in the first one,
 and the comment doesn't match the canonical style)

Of course, since I personally don't agree, I'd like to discuss it more
if possible.

"[PATCH 3/6] signals: use __group_complete_signal() for the specific signals too"
adds a behaviour change too.
Surely, I don't want to change the behaviour quietly, that is why I am
cc'ing maintainers.
(note also these patches are 8/6, 9/6. Originally I was going to send
 them in a separate series).
Oleg.
