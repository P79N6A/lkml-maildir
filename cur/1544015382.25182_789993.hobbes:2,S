Subject: make distclean currently broken (indirectly)

Just a 'heads up' to mention that there's a zero-sized file in Linus' tree
which gets removed by make distclean. It's arch/arm/mach-integrator/clock.h
I sent a patch ( 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/7/269
 ) a few days ago to git-rm
the empty file but admittedly the subject wasn't exactly attention-grabbing.
