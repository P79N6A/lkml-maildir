Oh, damn. That's a separate issue, apparently, and there you just use 
"__builtin_constant_p()" as a way to check that there are no side effects 
on "base".
Might as well drop the check for the value, since it doesn't matter.
Alternatively, we could just document the fact that neither "base" nor "n"
are normal arguments to a function. After all, we already _do_ change "n", 
and the strange calling convention is already documented as nothing but a 
sick hack to make architectures able to use inline assembly efficiently.
I could add a sparse check for "no side effects", if anybody cares (so 
that you could do
	__builtin_warning(
		!__builtin_nosideeffects(base),
		"expression has side effects");
in macros like these.. Sparse already has the logic internally..
