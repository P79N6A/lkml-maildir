There is no gettimeofday() in the running code anymore, and it was
placed not in common server processing code btw.
Ingo, do you really think I will send mails with faked benchmarks? :))
Btw, there were never almost twice perfromance increase - epoll in my
tests always showed 4-5 thousands requests per second, kevent - up to 7
thausands.
That starts looking like ghost hunting, Ingo, you already said that
you do not see any need in kevent, have you changed your opinion on
that?
