I don't get that.  The sequence is:
  - turn off preemption
  - unhook call points
  - synchronize_kernel
  - ...
which doesn't leave any preemption hole that I can see, so I can't comment
on a couple of the other points until you clear that one up.

But that one is easy: the zero check just takes the same spinlock as 
TRY_INC_MOD_COUNT, then sets can't-increment only in the case the count
is zero, considerably simpler than:

and leaves no window for spurious failure.  The still-initializing case is
also easy, e.g., a filesystem module simply doesn't call register_filesystem
until it's completely ready to service calls, so nobody is able to do
TRY_INC_MOD_COUNT.

Thanks, I'll read them all on the 21st ;-)  The other thing I need to read
closely is Roman's strategy for changing the module format, and the weird
linker connections.

Is there a case where removing a module would actually help?  What is
the user going to do next, try to reinsert the same module?
