You used the word "Never" and now you go away from it.... It wasn't Never,
and it will never be never if you want to include random binary only
modules. However in 2.4 for all intents and pruposes there was 4Kb already,
and now there still is, for user context. Because those interrupts DO
happen. NVidia was a walking timebomb, and with one function using 4Kb
that's an obvious Needs-Fix case. The kernel had a few of those in rare
drivers, most of which have been fixed by now. It'll never be never, but it
never was never either.
