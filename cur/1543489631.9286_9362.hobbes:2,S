Subject: Net packet transmission priority?

I have this machine connected to a cable modem and to a LAN by two
Ethernet cards. IP masq is being used. One of the machines on the LAN is
being used almost 5 or 6 hours daily (sometimes even more than that on
weekends) by my little brother, who's addicted to net Quake 2.
The problem is this: Q2 net performance really takes a dive when I'm doing
FTP from this machine. Interestingly enough, it's also affected by
tranfers to this machine. I operate a simple PPP dialup off of this for my
friends, and he claims that any file transfers over this line also impact
his game performance. Whether it's paranoia or true, I don't know.
Having said all that, I'm wondering if there's a way I can give his Q2
packets higher transmission priority over everything else, and if it's
even worth doing.
