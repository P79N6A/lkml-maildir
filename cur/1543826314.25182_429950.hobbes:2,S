Maybe we could modify the check-for-stack-overflows code with 8k stacks to
be "check for overflows which would kill a 4k stack kernel".  By decreasing
the thresholds to 3k (say).

I'd be surprised if it has to do with the packet code - more likely someone
screwed something up in the lockdep/genirq/unwind area and the kernel went
recursive.
I tried it here, couldn't reproduce it.  Laurent, can you (re?)send the
offending .config?
