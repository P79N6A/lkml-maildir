Grr, somebody should have killed this thread before these pointless,
irritating, and simply wrong arguments were made by the White fella.
Exactly because it's irritating many readers as can be witnessed above.
The kernel thread functionality is not used 1-to-1 in the userlevel
interfaces of the pthread library.  One very specific combination of all
the CLONE_* flags is used in libpthread.  Other users of the kernel
might use other combinations and they won't implement pthreads.  That
is perfectly fine and if it fits your bill, do it.  But none of this
ever has any influence on the pthread interface.  The properties like
sharing of file descriptors are guaranteed.
If somebody insists in future to discuss kernel "thread" related issues,
use the term "clone" instead of "thread".  This will keep the irritation
level down.
