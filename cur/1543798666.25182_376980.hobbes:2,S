However, a number of generic templates can be provided if it makes things
easier for the arches because all they need to is:
	[arch/wibble/Kconfig]
	config MUTEX_TYPE_FOO
		bool
		default y
	[include/asm-wibble/system.h]
	#define __mutex_foo_this() { ... }
	#define __mutex_foo_that() { ... }
The unconditional two-state exchange I think will be a useful template for a
number of archs that don't have anything more advanced than XCHG/TAS/BSET/SWAP.

That's irrelevant. Any arch that has LL/SC almost certainly emulates CMPXCHG
with LL/SC.

Two points:
 (1) LL/SC does not require an additional initial load.
 (2) CMPXCHG does an implicit load; how else can it compare?
LL/SC can never be worse than CMPXCHG, if only because you're very unlikely to
have both, but it can be better.
