I thought you wrote tg3 without docs and without help from Broadcom?
To repeat, my point is that the drivers used most by users of
enterprise distros will get written with or without vendor docs or
help.  Drivers for hardware that only a few people care about probably
won't be written and definitely won't be maintained by volunteers even
if the vendor publishes docs.  And I think that's pretty much what I
said in both of the paragraphs you quoted above.
