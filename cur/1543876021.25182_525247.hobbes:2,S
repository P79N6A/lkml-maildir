err, this is not the direction we wanted to go ... this requires
changes to the user<->kernel boundary which certainly will be rejected
by the glibc maintainers since it implies breakage in POSIX behavior
and is specific to no-mmu only ...
the plan is to hold onto this cruft in Blackfin until we get this bug
sorted out:
http://blackfin.uclinux.org/gf/project/uclinux-dist/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&tracker_item_id=3027
as the thing we'll send to mainline will be sane (a no-mmu specific
kconfig option to control the memset in the kernel malloc)
the memset in the kernel right now for no-mmu is by design, not defect
... we can chat about this more via Blackfin channels if you like, or
just wait till we meet up in Shanghai
