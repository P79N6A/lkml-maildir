 Hi...
    I want to add my own bit (a #define PG_MYBIT)
 similar to into the flags in task_struct as defined
 in linux v2.4.4 in sched.h which is defined as:
 unsigned long flag; /*per process flags */ 
 
    I want a free #define where I can define the
 process specific flag like PG_EXITING, PG_STARTING.
 
    Similarly, I also want to add my own bit into the
 flags in the _page struct_ wherein I can establish
 the state of a particular page.
   
    Using this my program wants to distinguish
 between some privileged pages of a process
 (privileged for my program which serves them..) from
 other processes and pages.
 
    Please tell me which #define can I use to do this
 in both the structures.
   
    Thanking you in advance,
  
 Amber
