	Most modern wireless drivers support the scan function (airo,
hostap, orinoco v15, prism54, atmel_cs, wl3501, madwifi, ipw2x00,
acx100, poldhu, at76c503, adm8211... - check my Howto).
	Unfortunately, the implementation is highly dependant on the
hardware itself, and each hardware has it's own way. Chipset which are
"softer" require more work. A good example of harder MAC is
airo/orinoco, for softer MAC check madwifi.
	Good luck...
