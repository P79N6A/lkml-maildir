this can be called both with and without i_sem held. i_sem is held
for directory modifications but not for simple lookups. Is it correct
to increase i_sem count above 1? Note, it will be done by every
task so it may screw up locking completely.
Look at <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105233420622539&w=2> for alternative fix.
