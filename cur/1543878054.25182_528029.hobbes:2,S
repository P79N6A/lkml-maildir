I think both avenues would probably be the right way to proceeed.
Getting kthreads to not be parented by init would be an opportunity
for optimization.
I think organizing the zombie tasks to be easily reaped also has merit.
Rapidly forking/exiting processes like udevd during the boot of a
different machine were also shown to benefit significantly from this
patch.  That machine had 512 cpus and 4608 disk devices, we dropped the
device discovery under udevd by 30%.  This, honestly, surprised us.
It makes some sense now that I think about it.  This would be a case
where improving the zombie handling would be beneficial to more than
just kthreads.
Thanks,
Robin
