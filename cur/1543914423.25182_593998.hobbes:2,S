Not related to the patch for 2.6.23, but I have a gut feeling that 
something might be done the wrong way later:
If I understand you correctly, you are saying that I will have to 
install HAL for getting a whitelist for in-kernel functionality?
It is a good thing if userspace can add currently missing devices to
whitelists, but the whitelist itself should be in the kernel.
