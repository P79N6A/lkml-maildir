Uuuh, uggly. Don't do that. Device drivers are there to abstract things,
not to play around with registers from userspace.

Yes, it does. What you can do is close()ing the file handle between
accesses, which makes it work but is slow.

What kind of problem do you want to solve? Userspace is for
applications, and applications usually don't have to know about hardware
details like registers. So if you have to do something every 10 ms from
userspace, your design is probably wrong.
If you absolutely need to do such things from userspace, have a look at
uio. But in most cases the answer is: make a proper abstraction for the
problem you wanna solve and write a proper driver.
