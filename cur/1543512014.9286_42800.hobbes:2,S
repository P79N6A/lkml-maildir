Wrong. The driver is written, and may or may not be adapted (with
only a few lines of code) to the device FS.
I know, I hand patched the OSS stuff once when it didn't go in
cleanly and Richard's fix hadn't made it to the FTP site yet. It
was only a matter of a couple hours and Richards FTP site was
totally up to date.
For support, he's about the best patch maintainer out there!
