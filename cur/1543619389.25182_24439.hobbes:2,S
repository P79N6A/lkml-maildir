Hmm.  That sounds a little slow to me.  That is about what I get
with LinuxBIOS from when I flip the power switch, and network boot..
But that is enough enjoyment of speed.

That might be a useful addition, as it will probably work for most
devices.  However it doesn't handle non-PCI devices.  And it doesn't
handle strange devices that need a different shutdown.  
With module_exit() I am quiet certain the linux driver can find the
device and set it up again, because otherwise you couldn't insert,
remove, and reinsert the code as a module.

I like the other suggestion of extending the Hot-plug infrastructure.
In that case I just need to figure out how to logically Hot-unplug all
the devices in the system.  That may be better than a
do_exitcalls()...  As it automatically gets the discrimination right.

Well that is directly booting vmlinux, and it doesn't lock you into
booting the linux kernel which is very important to me.

I'll love to hear how it goes.
