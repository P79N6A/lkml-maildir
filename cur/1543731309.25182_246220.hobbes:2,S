Every Linux shop I know of uses amanda anyway, which will not be
affected by these changes, as it uses dump/restore.  restore will need
minor changes, I think dump might not have to be changed at all.
If your backup system can't easily handle these changes, that's a pretty
good indication that it's poorly designed.
