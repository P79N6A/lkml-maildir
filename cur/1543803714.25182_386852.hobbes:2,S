If you do not execute the ACPI taskfiles for the device and you are
doing an ACPI suspend you are in completely undefined space. Whether it
eats your disk or not is a question of probabilities only. Yes its
unlikely but you are in undefined space so "won't corrupt anything"
indicates an inappropriate level of certainty.
Fortunately it is better than the old PATA layer where as far as I can
tell if the BIOS resume restores the BIOS HPA setup you may actually end
up doing more damage by running ACPI taskfiles as we don't appear to
restore enough drive state.
