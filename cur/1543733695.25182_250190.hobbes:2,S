For page faults, cr2 gives you the linear address, i.e., after
adding the base of the segment, which you can only find
by looking up the GDT and/or LDT for the correct segment.
Of course, the address decoding depends also of the size
attributes of the code segment (16 or 32 bits for i386, 
64 bits for x86_64) which needs also a lookup of CS in the
segment tables, and of a possible address prefix which 
affects the decoding. Of course this is fraught with race
if another thread modifies the LDT at the same time.
Then most instructions use a standard memory address
encoding, but there are a few exceptions which implicitly
use ESI and/or EDI. For the ones that use two memory 
addresses (movs/cmps), you'd have to even compute both 
addresses and decide which one is the unaligned one. 
I somehow suspect that Sparc is somewhat simpler to decode
than i386/x86_64 ;-)
Don't bloat the kernel with decoding this mess, please.
A helper library in user space, why not?
