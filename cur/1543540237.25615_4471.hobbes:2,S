Could you explain your problems with gcc-2.7.2.3, please ?
Do you mean a lot of warnings from pgtable.h ? They are meaningless
(compiler bug). However they may be removed applying the following patch:
diff -u --recursive linux-2.4test4-6/include/asm-i386/pgtable.h linux/include/asm-i386/pgtable.h

It does not inflict the generated code, but removes compiler warnings.
If you need over 4GB memory support - it is a real problem... 
The gcc-2.7.2.3 compiled 2.4.0test kernels I use on some machines seem to be
quite stable.
