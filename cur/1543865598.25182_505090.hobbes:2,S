i am honored to present the very first build fix for v2.6.20, as a
tribute to the Colts.

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
The very first "make ARCH=i386 randconfig" gave this build error:
    LD      vmlinux
  drivers/built-in.o: In function `cafe_nand_remove':
  cafe.c:(.text+0x19277a): undefined reference to `nand_release'
  drivers/built-in.o: In function `cafe_nand_cmdfunc':
  cafe.c:(.text+0x193036): undefined reference to `nand_wait_ready'
  drivers/built-in.o: In function `cafe_nand_probe':
  cafe.c:(.text+0x19359e): undefined reference to `nand_scan_ident'
  cafe.c:(.text+0x193658): undefined reference to `nand_scan_tail'
  distcc[1703] ERROR: compile (null) on localhost failed
  make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
which i suspect was a side-effect of the late and optimistic MTD merge.
but hey, we always knew Linux was better at offense than at defense, and 
good offense is what wins the game in the end, as the Bears had to find 
out the hard way ;-)
so here's the fix for the 3 affected MTD drivers: DOC2000, DOC2001 and 
DOC2001PLUS.
