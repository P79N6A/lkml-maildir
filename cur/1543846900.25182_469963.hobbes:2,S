Not all of the false positives are gcc bugs.
There are cases where it's technically impossible for gcc to figure out 
that a variable is always initialized.

What we'd need would be some -Wno-may-be-used-uninitialized gcc option 
that turns off the "may be may be used uninitialized" warnings but not 
the "is used uninitialized" warnings.
This would:
- give us a way to silence these warnings
- allow people to see the warnings if they want to
- not increase the maintenance overhead
