I hate to report this again, I saw some reports that it was fixed with 
4.0.3 of XFree86, so I tried XF86 4.0.3 with RedHat 7.1.
Any time it tries to turn the monitor off, it crashes.  I get no oopses.
Nothing.
Has anyone figured out why it crashes?  How can I fix it besides remove 
the power savings option of automatically shutting the monitor off? 
BTW, I am running this box with ACPI.  It crashes even more if I use 
APM.  I never could figure that out, but anyway.
