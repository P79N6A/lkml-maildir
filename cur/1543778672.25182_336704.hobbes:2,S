Hello,
powersaving is not working with a 2.6.12-rc3-mm1 kernel and a amd64
3500+ on a nvidia nforce 4 mainboard.
syslog tells me the following about it:
...
ACPI: Processor [CPU0] (supports 8 throttling states)
...
powernow-k8: Found 1 AMD Athlon 64 / Opteron processors (version 1.40.2)
acpi_processor-0252 [04] acpi_processor_get_per: Error evaluating _PSS
powernow-k8: BIOS error - no PSB or ACPI _PSS objects
acpi_processor-0252 [04] acpi_processor_get_per: Error evaluating _PSS
kind regards
flo
