there used to be hack to preserve perm's that used tar.
however with the advent of devfsd that hack is gone. now you just specify
the permissions in a config file, exact syntax i forget, but something like:
/dev/sd/c0b1t3u0 PERM root.disk 664
/dev/sd	PERM	root.disk	660
etc.. and all your SCSI disks will automatically get these perm's when
they're created, except for disk bus1id3, which get's special perms's.. etc.
now that's nice. Much easier to admin, which leads to better security, etc.
