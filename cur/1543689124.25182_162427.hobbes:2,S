Ok, I tried with 2.4.20 again in single user mode. Same freeze.
Numlock was still working... sysrq+t/k etc don't give anything but cause
a freeze such that numlock no longer works also.
One disk is on one HPT370 and one is on one VIA IDE controller. Please
note that when I swap the hpt370 controller with a promise ultra 100 tx2
(pdc 20268) I get a system freeze on raid reconstruction (kernel 2.4.20
to 22) as soon as I turn on DMA on the pdc's... raid reconstructions
works fine with the hpt370s and DMA on though...
Shall I go back even further i.e. to 2.4.19 ? I will happily try out
other stuff if it helps fixing that problem. I thought maybe the dxr3
driver occupies the bus for a too long time ... could setting the pci
latency to <addvaluehere> of <which cards> help ?

Soeren.
