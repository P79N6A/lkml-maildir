I am sure there are some issues like you describe out there.
I suppose we could examine each local_irq_disable, but I wonder if there
is not a better way.
I wrote earlier, that we could just keep specific IRQ threads from
runnning, rather than disabling preemption overall.
This is somewhat orthogonal, but would serve as a filter to break things
down into local_irq_disable to keep a specific IRQ from running, and
local_irq_disable to suppress all IRQ activity.
If we're going to walk trough all these local_irq_disables, we might as
well check-off that item as well.
What do you think?
Sven
