Yes, if I know I want to attack David Miller's password,
and I'm going to keep trying until I succeed, then knowing
the length of his password doesn't help much.  However, if
I'm on a multi-user system and I just want to crack any
password for any one of the users on that system, then
knowing the lengths of passwords does help, because I can
focus my effort on those users with the shortest passwords.
Thus, revealing password lengths might heighten the risk of
password guessing (even if only by a small factor).
