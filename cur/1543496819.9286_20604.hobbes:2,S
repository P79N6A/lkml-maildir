Just had a wacky idea on how they >could< have done it.  Suppose you had a
bit in the inode that indicated the file was in a sub-allocated block.  Only
small files would get combined in a sub-allocated block.  Since all inodes
pointing to the same block would be for sub-allocated block files, we could
safely assume that this normal data block can have a special format.  Say a
small header table that lists the files inodes and their specific offsets in
the block (the thought being that there is not enough room in the "regular"
inode to hold the offset information - and that if any changes needed to be
made to the sub-allocation, it could all be done in the block itself.  There
would be no need to go back and pull all the inodes for the files that are
contained in the sub-allocated block).  This would only be useful for large
block sizes (>= 16K ?), but I'm guessing that the overhead should not be too
much.
Does this make sense, or do I need to explain in more detail?
