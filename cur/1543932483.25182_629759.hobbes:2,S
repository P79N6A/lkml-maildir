A quick look at your setattr patches seems very promising.  And I've further
realized more cleanup is possible: because we call revalidate_chain at the
opening to ->setattr, we're guaranteed to have a valid lower dentry, so for
example we can remove the else case for "if (lower_dentry)".
I'll be testing this and your other patches, plus look into the locking
issues you brought up.
Thanks,
Erez.
