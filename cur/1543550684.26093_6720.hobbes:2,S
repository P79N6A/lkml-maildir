I'm not sure why you'd want a block size of 1M, most block sizes tend to
be between 512 bytes and 4K.

For an ordinary filesystem, I think you'd always want to read a block
from disk.  Pages generally refer to memory (as in RAM or swap space),
not hard disk space, so I suppose you'd load a page from disk if you
were doing a virtual memory filesystem (but from your description it
sounds like you're doing an ordinary filesystem).
