Linux has never had a mechanism to deal with priority inversion since
it was first introduced (in 2.0, I believe?).  Victor Yodaiken gave an
excellent presentation at Linux Expo about why priority inheritance is
a stupid idea, but that particular section isn't in the Proceedings.
I also can't find it on the rtlinux website.  Victor, would you be so
kind as to post a link to it if it exists?
