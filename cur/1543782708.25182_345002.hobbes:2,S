Well, with my usual .config (-O2) and gcc-3.3.5-something it does:
text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3614     303    1696    5613    15ed drivers/hwmon/hdaps.o
3678     303    1696    5677    162d drivers/hwmon/hdaps.o (unlikely()s removed)
Fortunately, there is -Os:
text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3163     303    1696    5162    142a drivers/hwmon/hdaps.o
3163     303    1696    5162    142a drivers/hwmon/hdaps.o (unlikely()s removed)
See? The difference is 64 vs 451 bytes.
