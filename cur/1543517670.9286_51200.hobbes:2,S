brw_page does exist, but it doesn't mention b_end_io, and it is not
heavily referenced ...  the function itself is not at all clear to me. 
Init_buffer seems more of a promising trail It's used twice in
buffer.c. Aha! It's getblk! Yes .. that looks better. The default for
b_end_io is end_buffer_io_sync!
        /* OK, FINALLY we know that this buffer is the only one of its kind,
         * and that it's unused (b_count=0), unlocked, and clean.
         */
        init_buffer(bh, dev, block, end_buffer_io_sync, NULL);
        bh->b_state=0;
        insert_into_queues(bh);
        return bh;         
Yes. I don't know how I missed that. Thank you! Now why didn't I see
that! OK .. that explains it. The default end_io is a static.
  static void end_buffer_io_sync(struct buffer_head *bh, int uptodate)
{
        mark_buffer_uptodate(bh, uptodate);
        unlock_buffer(bh);
}       
There's an end_buffer_io_async too .. Sigh. What I want is to commit a
buffer to a certain target area without discarding the buffer. Then I
want to retarget the buffer in a different (or the same buffer_head)
and commit it again. "The same" buffer_head would be nice.
Thanks again.
