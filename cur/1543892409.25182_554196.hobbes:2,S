Subject: [PATCH] enable interrupts in user path of page fault.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/6/541

This is a minor fix, but what is currently there is essentially wrong.
In do_page_fault, if the faulting address from user code happens to be
in kernel address space (int *p = (int*)-1; p = 0xbed;)  then the
do_page_fault handler will jump over the local_irq_enable with the
  goto bad_area_nosemaphore;
But the first line there sees this is user code and goes through the
process of sending a signal to send SIGSEGV to the user task. This whole
time interrupts are disabled and the task can not be preempted by a
higher priority task.
This patch always enables interrupts in the user path of the
bad_area_nosemaphore.
