This is an older method not used for device drivers, but only for searching for
busses or i2c et al, of which drivers stands aside and controls the device.

Yup, but pci probing doesn't have such mechanism.

If it happens that way, it's easy to add sub*ids into pci device id table too
and the problem will go away.
