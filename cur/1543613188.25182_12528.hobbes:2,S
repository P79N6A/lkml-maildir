 I haven't seen this reported anywhere, so apologies if you've heard this
before :).
 in 2.4.9 and 2.4.16 with APM compiled in on my Sony Vaio FX201 laptop
(Via VT82C686 chipset) sometimes when the hardware screensaver comes on
(as a result of APM) the machine deadlocks and has to be powered off and
on again.  (Lots of fscking).
 If you want any more info, please ask :).
