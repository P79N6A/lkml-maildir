hardirq handlers are supposed to be fast. If they're slow the code
should (and generally is) using bottom halves/tasklets/softirqs. Combine
this with the fact that each new irq handler will start with a bunch of
cache misses, the latency added isn't generally that significant. In
addition, the cache miss thing makes the nesting suck a lot, it's faster
to batch the irqs in sequence.
