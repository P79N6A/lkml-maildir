You guys probably already know but i'm still having problems with the ide
timer in 2.5.5 :
hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=c01c5e10, new=c01c5e10
bug: kernel timer added twice at c01c7293.
NFS: NFSv3 not supported.
nfs warning: mount version older than kernel
hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=c01c5e10, new=c01c5e10
bug: kernel timer added twice at c01c7293.
The machine seems working fine but i get these messages at the end of the
kernel boot sequence. If you need more info just let me know.
