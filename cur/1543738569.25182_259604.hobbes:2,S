Please get these 4 patches into the 2.6.9 release:
distinct-tgid-tid-cpu-usage.patch
  distinct tgid/tid CPU usage
show-aggregate-per-process-counters-in-proc-pid-stat-2.patch
  show aggregate per-process counters in /proc/PID/stat 2
kallsyms-data-size-reduction--lookup-speedup.patch
  kallsyms data size reduction / lookup speedup
fix-process-start-times.patch
  Fix reporting of process start times
BTW, the explanation for ps-shows-wrong-ppid.patch
is messed up. It referrs to a "Thread 3", but there
is no such thread. An explanation in terms of clone()
would also be an improvement.
