It's a harmless bug, somewhat reducing the amount of balancing we can do
on SMP, but the balancer was still pretty much intact (we'd have noticed
it earlier if it wasnt). The bug was found by Scott Rhine and myself not
because the scheduler behaved badly, but via code review, because the
comments did not match the code :-)
