alan cox announced with one of his pre7 patches that there was a
feature to turn off 2.{1,2}'s habit of auto adding route's for
devices.
i looked at the patch, and it seems it should add something to
/proc/sys/net/ipv4 like ip_autoroute or something.. but i can't
find anything. 
so how do you do it?
uname -mrs 
Linux 2.2.0-pre7-ac6 i586
