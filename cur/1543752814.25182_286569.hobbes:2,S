It needs a lock prefix. Volume 2 of the IA32 manual states on page 150
regarding cmpxchg (Note that the atomicity mentioned here seems to apply
to the complete instruction not the 64 bit fetches and stores):
This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction
to be executed atomically. To simplify the interface to the processor's
bus, the destination operand receives a write cycle without regard to the
result of the comparison. The destination operand is written back ifthe
comparison fails; otherwise, the source operand is written into the
destination. (The processor never produces a locked read without also
producing a locked write.)
