I seem to remember either the early RH 7.x series or 6.x series did not 
necessarily install ncurses by default, thus make menuconfig did not 
run.  If you did a very slim install, you may not have the right 
libraries to do what you need.  Do an 'rpm -q ncurses ncurses-devel' and 
see what you get.  If either is not found, make menuconfig will not run.
