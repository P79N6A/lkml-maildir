   I would like to submit a patch that adds a /proc file to the kernel which 
   monitors the health of active TCP connections. It does this by counting 
   the number of duplicate ACKs sent out, among other things.
   I have a website detailing the exact metrics used and why I choose them:

I would rather that you add this to the tcp_diag facility in
2.4.x instead of creating yet another proc file.  tcp_diag is
designed perfectly for fetching the kind of information your
TCP health monitor is providing.
This is irregardless of whether your selection of health metrics is
sound or not, I have not looked into this part at all.  But it will
have to be discussed before we think about adding the changes.
