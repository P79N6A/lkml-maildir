It has absolutely nothing to do with the GPL vs BSD licensing on the
code it has to do with the belief that fbdev isn't a complete enough
model to do what needs to be done and merging it into the DRM is just
going to make things worse rather than better, I've no idea where you
ever came up with it being a licensing thing at all... the FreeBSD ppl
have on interest in taking fbdev code anyways...
Having a shared layer allows the two drivers to at least discuss the
ownership of the hardware, we have two stacks of software, merging
them into one stack isn't going to solve any magical problems, it just
means we have one larger mess, my belief is once the two can
communicate, the DRM can disable fbdev if a proper solution on top of
the DRM becomes available...  merging fbdev into the DRM is always the
wrong answer, so please stop talking.

And that's nice for you, it isn't nice in the real world where we have
two drivers driving the device and need to fix it without breaking it
first.

That's called working in the kernel, it's always been like that, you
seemed to think your code wasn't going to require re-writes, it did,
you didn't agree with the maintainers suggestions stating you had all
those code depending on it working like you stated.. I could go on,
but I'm just wasting more of the small amounts of time I have to work
on this stuff.
Dave.
