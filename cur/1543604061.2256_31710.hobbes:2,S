It may if you don't update very often. It depends on your
read-to-write ratio.

Either you see the element or you don't. If you want to avoid duplication,
you could do a locked search before inserting it.
Like I said before, lock-less lookups are useful for read-mostly
data. Yes, updates are costly, but if they happen rarely, you still benefit.
