Oh, indeed!
# cat /sys/block/sda/device/rev

So what about SATA blacklisting based on a model/firmware version rather 
than on a model only?
My model (ST3200822AS) is blacklisted, though I'm stress-testing it for 
the second day and nothing happened, so I assume I may not be affected.
The question is, if I'm not affected because:
1) I'm lucky and it didn't happen yet,
2) hard drive (ST3200822AS) firmware is better - is anyone in contact 
with Seagate?
3) SATA controller (Silicon Image SiI 3112) BIOS is better - is anyone 
in contact with Silicon Image?
Additional question: is there a way to check the SATA controller BIOS as 
easily as it is with the drive firmware?
