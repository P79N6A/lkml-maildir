Hi Peter,
the below patches are obsolete for at least the 2.3.39pre2. The 2.3.39
won't build on PPC.
The last kernels didn't build up to 2.3.39pre2 Linus-tree (it will
build). Paul has a tree on linuxcare.com.au which you can access via
rsync (rsync -auvz linuxcare.com.au::linux-pmac-devel < your dir>)
It is/was a 2.3.38 until this morning (euro time)
One prob you'll have when compiling IDE, therefore you have to define
the XFER_UDMA_5 & 6 in linux/include/hdreg.h, you'll find it in the
2.3.39 branch.

Hope that helps
