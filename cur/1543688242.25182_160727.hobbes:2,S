Chances are -neither- of these kernels have HT enhancements for the scheduler.  
I am positive the 260test kernels do not have shared runqueues for HT 
siblings and the scheduler does not make use of the cpu_sibling_map.  Test 
make -j2 with HT disabled, and I bet you get better results than make -j2 
with HT enabled....

This article is incorrect.  The scheduler changes did not make it in to 2.5.32

This article discusses the changes needed, but does not state that the changes 
are in the 2.5 kernel.
This is still a problem, even the "What to Expect From 2.6" is incorrect:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/misc/post-halloween-2.5.txt
Ingo's latest patch that fixes this is here:
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-2.5.68-B2
And here for 2.4:
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-HT-2.4.21-rc7-ac1-A1
Not sure why the FFT results are so much lower on 2.6, but I'm not sure sure 
it has anything to do with HT, maybe something else?  Can you try turning off 
HT and see what happens?
