It may have partly been a problem of having half of softmac and half
devicescape.  I'm not entirely sure what udev did.
I tried a patch for the Sonic Silicon that was posted and I turned off
all the configuration for the softmac driver.
It isn't crashing right now but 802.11 isn't working either.  I may get
a chance this weekend to try some things with it, and some different
firmware sets.
If the new bcm43xx drivers do not support 802.11b at all and never will,
I missed the documentation.  Someone should add that to Kconfig.
