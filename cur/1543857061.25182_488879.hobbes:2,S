The first of the 8 patches which currently exist just moves things around 
physically. Just that is not enough, unfortunately, some tweaking is 
needed anyway (static functions, new headers, Kconfig changes, etc), so I 
think it might maybe be better to take the bunch of all 8 patches 
initially as a whole, as they really don't do too intrusive changes to the 
code, and could stay in tree for some testing (though I of course tested 
them to some extent) together.
