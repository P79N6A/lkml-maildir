I thought it was still broken.  Last I compared different asm-* arch
implementations of dma_supported(), the semantics were inconsistent.
The "mask" was sometimes ignored, sometimes treated as an upper
bound on the address, once I recall it even being used as a mask!
Some of that inconsistency seemed to come from PCI though.
