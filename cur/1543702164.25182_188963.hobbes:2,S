Two problems here. First, ide-floppy should not verbosely fail these
commands (2/3a/00 is 'medium not present'). Second, you are not using
the proper mechanism to detect media events.

I doubt ide-floppy behaves any differently. But at least you can send
packet commands generically to any atapi/scsi device in 2.6, so the code
has a chance to work a bit more generically (without tons of ugly and
different ioctls for each device type).
