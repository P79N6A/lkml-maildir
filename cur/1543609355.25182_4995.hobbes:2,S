That all depends on what you mean by "stable". Reiser
is certainly capable of high uptimes, but Reiser
doesn't have a good history of working well with older
UNIX tools/systems like NFS, due to Reiser's newer
methods for handling inodes and such. If this isn't a
problem for you, Reiser should work very well for you;
it works great on my /var partition, which handles my
Squid proxy. I don't use Reiser on my /home partition
though; that FS has the user directories exported
through NFS, as well as Samba. In fact, I use SGI's
XFS on my /home partition, and that works well too.
The main advantage to using XFS is that it handles NFS
_really_ well, and it has certain features Reiser
doesn't, like extended attributes, and access control
lists. YMMV, but Reiser seems stable for just that one
specific duty . . . I'd recommend trying Reiser, JFS,
XFS, and maybe even Ext3 to get a feel for how stable
each is for your particular needs. HTH.
