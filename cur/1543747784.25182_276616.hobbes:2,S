cvsps -x for days showed this as the last checkin.

x86: move PIT code to timer_pit
(Logical change 1.21009)
Members:
        arch/i386/kernel/i8259.c:1.35->1.36
        arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_pit.c:1.14->1.15
        include/asm-i386/timer.h:1.15->1.16

Perhaps I'm the only user, I use it on a daily basis, it worked fine
until a few days ago.
