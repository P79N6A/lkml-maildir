The hard locks I had reported as correlated with X-idle turn out to not
require X be running at all. 
I renamed xdm/kdm so that init couldn't start it, and then had a ping
going from another system as a guide.  Pressing Enter once on the console
to establish a 'start time', the machine would die between 8 and 9 minutes
later. 
There is also the possibility that I should be timing from absolute kernel
start, since the system spends a real long time fsck-ing my drives from
the previous crash each time.
I thought this might be a console-blank issue because the monitor always
goes into some kind of standby modes when it crashes, but doing setterm
-blank 1, setterm -powerdown 1, and setterm -powersave [on/powerdown]
worked fine and did not crash.  This problem appeared somewhere between
.122, which was clean, and .128, which crashed. 
I don't know what might be causing the crashes, but it certainly seems as
though it only crashes when keyboard/mouse activity has ceased.
