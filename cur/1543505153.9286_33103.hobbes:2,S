I see. Well, are such networks used somewhere for transit?
I mean: if host attached to ax.25 advertises MTU=128 doing TCP,
we need not pmtu discovery. The only case, when it is bad is AX.25
using as transit between two high MTU networks.
Seriously, Alan. I am about to disable PMTU discovery to decrease
MTU under 556(512+20+20) and to fall to fragmentation instead.
Well, I am not about to. I already did it. It is sysctl option,
but it does not help, because big servers will not believe
to PMTU discovery for clients sitting on ethernets behind AX.25 links...
