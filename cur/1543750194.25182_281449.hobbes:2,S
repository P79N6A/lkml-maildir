Really? I have this in fs/Kconfig (2.6.8+2.6.9-rc2):
menu "Network File Systems"
        depends on NET
config NFS_FS
        tristate "NFS file system support"
        depends on INET
        select LOCKD
        select SUNRPC
        select NFS_ACL_SUPPORT if NFS_ACL
So SUNRPC should always be selected whenever you say yes/module to "NFS file 
system support".
Check the .config if NFS_FS=y or =m, that'd be my guess.
