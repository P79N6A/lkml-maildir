Has anyone seen the following message in there logs before?
Sep  6 12:00:17 Lserver pppd[21422]: Received bad configure-nak/rej:  12
06 00 00 00 01
I get it using ppp and it occurs every time I connect.  I have read the
pppd & chat man pages, checked the HOWTO, and the FAQ and rgrep'ed the
kernel source and have found no references to this message anywhere.
I have searched the kernel archives and not a word.
I am running 2.2.12 kernel, SMP, zoom v34I modem, which I believed is a
bit on the hosed side.  I have been up 9 days 12 hours, and checked the
logs a few days ago and was not recieving the message. (yesterday)
My first thought was that it may be related to my init string
AT&F&Q6S95=0&S0&C1&W as it is the only thing that has changed in my ppp
setup, however I had the same init string yesterday, and this problems
has only started occuring today.  I also started getting VJ compression
errors in my logs, but removed them by chagning my nr/nt from 12 to 9.
Since this message is showing up in my logs I am guessing it is coming
from the kernel (printk), but as I have done various rgreps on the
source I cannot find where the message is coming from.
Any ideas?  Thanks Joe
