I think the idea is to (depending on the hardware) dynamically adjust 
the
system timers to exactly the time necessary.  If you don't have any 
important
processes that will interrupt within the next 10ms then you can just go
ahead and set the timer longer.  If properly done you might even be able
to set HZ to 20 or 50.  Hardware interrupts would trigger immediate
responses, but otherwise a non-interactive system could minimize the
number of context switches and make the processor cache that much
more useful.  This would still be bad on an interactive/desktop system
because it would mean that perceptive users could detect the switching
if they have two computationally intensive jobs running simultaneously.
