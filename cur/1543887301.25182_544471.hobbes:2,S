never with a loong deprecations period.  At least for APIs that are not
private to a single obscure driver.  But this would require people actually
beeing aware of creating ABIs, and maybe someone with half a clue reviewing
them. Which of course is not the case today, thanks to ioctls, procfs, sysfs,
debugfs and co people can create userspace ABIs without a single though
easily, and they happily do it.
