I've seen someone else report that this occurs when klogd reads a NULL
character. In his case the line in the 3c59x.c driver which prints out the
'product code' was responsible for this.
In the 2.4.1 patch this printk has been added to 3c59x.c:-
+    printk(KERN_INFO "  product code '%c%c' rev %02x.%d date %02d-"
+            "%02d-%02d\n", eeprom[6]&0xff, eeprom[6]>>8, eeprom[0x14],
+            step, (eeprom[4]>>5) & 15, eeprom[4] & 31, eeprom[4]>>9);
Could you try commenting out these lines and see if it fixes the problem?
