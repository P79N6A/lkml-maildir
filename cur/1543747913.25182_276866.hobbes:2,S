resume_device is set by swsusp_read, which requires name_to_dev_t to be
working. At the point where that's called, the device driver hasn't been
loaded and we don't have the information to get the dev_t. Once the
driver has been loaded, name_to_dev_t has already been discarded (it's
marked __init). So we need to set resume_device somehow.

Heh. Yes, that's no problem. A new bigdiff for -rc3 would be helpful.

Ok. I'll look into that. The main reason I want code like this is that
Debian use modular IDE drivers that are stored in the initrd. The disks
won't be touched until the root file system is mounted, and we'll
trigger the resume before then, so there shouldn't be any risk of data
loss. At this point, there shouldn't be any userspace running other than
a single shell script - do you think it's still a problem?

Will do.
