How does "oomthresh" and "oomadj" affect each other?

Default "oomthresh" value for a new process is 0 (zero) I assume -
right?  If not, then I'd suggest that it should be.
What happens when a process fork()s? Does the child enherit the
parents "oomthresh" value?
Would it make sense to make "oomthresh" apply to process groups
instead of processes?

What happens in the case where the OOM killer really, really needs to
kill one or more processes since there is not a single drop of memory
available, but all processes are below their configured thresholds?

Impossible to know without posting the patch for review :)
