If there is no objection, I'll put together a patch that changes the use in 
JFFS2 into a "magic number", complete with documentation on it, and also 
moves all of the zlib stuff into a single directory.

Does anyone know if doing as Mark suggests would negatively impact the 
performance of JFFS2 to such a degree that it could be considered a 
regression? I, unfortunately, don't have the hardware to properly test the 
code. And, at this point in time, I also don't have enough familiarity with 
the JFFS2 code to make such a change myself.
