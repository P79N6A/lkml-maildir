That's pragmatic, a good short term solution.  Getting rid of page->buffers 
entirely will be nicer, and in that case you want to cache the physical block
only for those pages that have one, e.g., not for swap-backed pages, which
keep that information in the page table.
I've been playing with the idea of caching the physical block in the radix
tree, which imposes the cost only on cache pages.  This forces you to do a
tree probe at IO time, but that cost is probably insignificant against the
cost of the IO.  This arrangement could make it quite convenient for the
filesystem to exploit the structure by doing opportunistic map-ahead, i.e.,
when ->get_block consults the metadata to fill in one physical address, why
not fill in several more, if it's convenient?
