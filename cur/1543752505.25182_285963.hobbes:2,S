what the....no!!
changelogs have to be verbose, i'm still often missing hints in the 
current changelogs, commenting that patch_a and update_b got in because 
of a security issue. some boxes need only be updated for the sake of 
security, so one would be happy only watching for <security patch> lines 
in the kernel changlogs. giving credits to the people who found the 
problem is still possible by mentioning the (source of the)original 
advisory.
