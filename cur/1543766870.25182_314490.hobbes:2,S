It's not just triggering bugs.  You have very fine control over what
you present in your filesystem.  Examples are huge files, huge
directories, operations that complete slowly or never at all.
Is it possible to limit all these from kernelspace?  Probably yes,
although a timeout for operations is something that cuts either way.
And the compexity of these checks would probably be orders of
magnitude higher then the check we are currently discussing.
So this check _is_ needed on systems where the users cannot be trusted.
Thanks,
Miklos
