I agree, sort-of. Yet, I'd argue that the holes tried to poke here rely
on the admin being sloppish not with regular operation, but _while
configuring the security policy_. The only way to protect against that
is to shoot the admin on sight.
Which might not be a bad idea, looking at the stats of the human error
still being the most dangerous detail in any equation, yet it may be
considered impractical.

I resent that remark. At the same level I could argue that some other
people in this discussion do have a professional interest in getting it
_not_ merged. (And LSM ripped out _now_ before it gets a chance to
address the comments made so far.) I'd rather not go there. 
But while we're there, just really briefly, it is important to point out
that while Novell/SUSE obviously _does_ have a corporate interest, it is
not required for this to be "ASAP", and I trust that Crispin, Tony et
al will work to incorporate all feedback received. I don't think we're
in any rush, and even if LSM _is_ ripped out, that just means that the
patch series will be augmented with a further patch [01/xx] "Reinstate
LSM hooks w/additional provisions to address code cleanliness."
Going back to the technical side of things, I'd be more happy if the
holes poked were something you could reasonably expect to be able to
protect against.
Sincerely,
    Lars Marowsky-Brée
