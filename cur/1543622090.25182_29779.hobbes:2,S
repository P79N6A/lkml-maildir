Martin,
please tell us up-front if you are able to make Linux work
with 48-bit IDE stuff so Linux is able to talk to drives
larger than 137 GB.
If you're not, please stop pissing off Andre and work
together with him ... we need the features of his new IDE
work in order to be able to support the new IDE hardware
which is being released soon (or sold already).
cheers,
Rik
