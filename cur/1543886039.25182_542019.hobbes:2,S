If they don't have dependencies on each other, yes. Some busses should
be finished before probing for others start (e.g. low-level busses).

I'm not sure whether that is not really a question of "one depends upon
the other". If the low level bus knows where to point its probe at, the
higher level should be able to look at sane devices after the firmware
has been loaded (or am I misunderstanding the situation here?)
