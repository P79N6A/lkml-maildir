Nope, AFAIK even if the motherboard dosn't have ISA-Slots, the ISA-like 
chipset (DMA/old IRQ/Timer) is still present because off compatiblity reasons.
But if you only want to know if a specified IO-range is on an ISA-card you 
could try to turn off the PCI-ISA brige, done this with Intel chipset before 
(they call this power saveing mode).
