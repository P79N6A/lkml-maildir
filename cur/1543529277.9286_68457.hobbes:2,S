Hi
I would like to propose CLONE_PDEATHKILL option.
This option just fills the gap that  exists when the thread
is started and before the prctl can be called to instruct
the child to receive signal when parent dies. So with this
option the clone/prctl combination would be complete.
The patch is very simple and uses the logic already
introduced by prctl:

This small program illustrates the problem of prctl as someone mentioned
earlier
- the prctl call could come too late (parent is already pid=1). The
CLONE_PDEATHKILL
option would solve this gap.
char stack2[10000];
int f2(void *arg)
{
        prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL);
        while (1) {
                printf("f2 pid=%d, ppid=%d\n", getpid(), getppid());
                sleep(1);
        }
        return 0;
}
int main()
{
        printf("main pid=%d, ppid=%d\n", getpid(), getppid());
        clone(f2, stack2 + sizeof(stack2), CLONE_VM | CLONE_FS |
CLONE_FILES, NULL);
        _exit(0);
        return 0;
}
