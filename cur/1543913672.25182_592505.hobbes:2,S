Why?  What would use this kind of interface?  Why would you want to
create things in sysfs without a kobject?

This is a source level for the sysfs functions compatibility, right?  Or
is this the userspace view of sysfs?  If the later one, why would that
have changed?

Is this really needed?  We work on kobjects and attributes today, and we
can easily add and remove groups of attributes just fine.

This might be nice, it would take code out of kobject_move(), right?

What sysfs users without kobjects?  Why?

Hm, I'll have to wait to see the code to understand what you mean by
this one :)
thanks for all your work on sysfs so far, it is much nicer than it used
to be.
