If you are going to muck with the startup code, I suggest this:

FYI, this machine is running with that change. The current
code loads a discriptor table with a (non-existant) length
of 0x8000 (plus a byte) bytes. For some reason, it's lucky.
Later on, more entries are added and the new table is loaded
with another LGDT instruction, fine. But, in the existing
code, any "entries" after those shown are video setup code.
The correct code will load the correct table length, not some
length that might be used in the future.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
