At first glance it looks like there might be some tab/space issues
in some of the #define blocks toward the end of the patch, although
those might be intentional.
Aside from whatever other style issues that might be identified, I'll
state that this code has been carried in wireless-dev for months and
thereby also spent a lot of time in -mm as well as Fedora (rawhide
and F-7).  The code has proven to be reasonably stable and reliable.
