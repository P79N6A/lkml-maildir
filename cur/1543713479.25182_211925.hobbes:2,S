I put LISP interpreter inside the Kernel -
http://vxe.quercitron.com
It works, but it use a lot of stack memory. It's
impossible to rewrite it easily, though I'll
investigate why exactly it uses so much of stack
memory (though it's nature of LISP). There are no
serious kernel memory allocation (as of my interpreter
code review, only function calls; recursions in LISP
application itself are eliminated for sure), but I'll
trace stack usage more thouroughly.
