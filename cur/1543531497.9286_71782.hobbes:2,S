No - if you write to address 0, this will lead to a signal anyway. No
overhead here.

Do this statically at init, once per process.

No; for the typical case, you just install a signal handler once, when
the app starts, then you can call malloc() and write to the resulting
address without any further checks at all.
If malloc() fails and you write to the (duff) "address" it returned,
you get signalled. If it succeeds, but you can't allocate the memory,
you get signalled. Then your signal handler just flushes all your
buffers and exits, or garbage collects and retries, or whatever.
MUCH simpler, IMHO.

Much better, IMO, to replace that whole mess with a nice "OOM signal".
No need to check return values, no need to compare things - MUCH less
overhead in the typical case (success).
