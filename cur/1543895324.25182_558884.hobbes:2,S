while I'm not per se against adding such aux vectors, I think it's a bad
mistake to make them a config option (and 2 options at that!!)
Stack protector is very widely deployed today
(Fedora,RHEL,SLES,OpenSUSE,Gentoo etc), so I can sure see the point of
helping it a bit... but I'd like to see a little more data on how the
current approach isn't sufficient.
