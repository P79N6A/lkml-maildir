Return to libc exploit, calling dup2, where some privileged data is
redirected from the normal file descriptor to one of the attackers
choosing.  The latter could be an outgoing socket connection which would
result in leaking the data to the outside.
         normal code                         intruder
                                          so = socket()
    fd = open ("local-file")
                                          dup2(so, fd);
    write (fd, privileged data)
It's just a little function call.  If the arguments of dup2() are known
this is not a big issue to construct.

It's completely different.
The reason why runtime libraries cannot keep descriptors open unless it
is explicitly part of the API (e.g., opendir) is that POSIX and Unix
forever guarantee that descriptors are allocated sequentially.  Linus
already showed a code sequence:
	close(0);
	.. something else ..
	if (open("myfile", O_RDONLY) < 0)
		exit(1);
This occurs in the real world and it is guaranteed to work.
