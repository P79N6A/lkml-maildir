Ditto.

Well if we say the kernel controls files (barring LSMs) based on simple
uids, then that is correct kernel operation :)
In other words we're not letting the kernel do anything it isn't
supposed to do.

They have more roles than that...
I phrased it the way I did to point out we shouldn't need to be using
ecryptfs - which uses the keyring to store actual encryptions keys - to
do this.

How can that be all?  How do we represent this on the filesystem then?
We can't store (namespace, uid) because we presumably dont' have actual
external unique ids for a namespace.  So we really will need to provide
global uids, and store those in the keys (and with the files).  So now
3475276bc0dcd9cc501ba9bb7f12683f1b867066 is my uid no matter where I am,
for instance.
