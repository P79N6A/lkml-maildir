Hi,
I have a problem with a machine hard-hanging when I run, e.g, 
'apt-cache search ...'. (Other apt commands hang it too).
The machine is:
AMD Athlon 800MHz machine,
Asus K7M (AMD-751 Irongate + Via VT82C686)
ECC RAM,
2 Sil3112A SATA controllers, 3 Seagate SATA disks.
It had been running for 300 days+ when there was a power outage. 
After the outage, a case fan had died and a hard disk had developed 
bad blocks (it was kicked from RAID array - Linux RAID). The fan was 
replaced. The disk was left in the machine in order to scrub it 
before RMA. The machine unfortunately now hard-hangs consistently.
Memtest86+ was run for over 18 hours (completing 18 passes) without 
any failures reported. So it possibly is not RAM related.
If I run 'strace apt-get search ...' from the console in single-user 
mode the last line it prints out is always the same, something like:
mmap2(NULL, 172032, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = .....
Always that size, 172032 (which occurs only a couple of times afaict 
- it's mmaping space to read either the RPM database or APT package 
lists into i think).
This happens with swap disabled. It happens with the duff disk 
removed from the machine. It happens with any of the following Fedora 
kernels:
kernel-2.6.11-1.35_FC3
kernel-2.6.13-1.1532_FC4
kernel-smp-2.6.13-1.1532_FC4
I havn't tried any others.
The keyboard is unresponsive: caps/num lock LEDs unresponsive. 
Doesn't respond to SysRQ. I tried enabling the NMI watchdog 
(nmi_watchdog=2 for lapic NMI), but it doesn't fire either - NMI 
interrupts seem to come in 1/minute when it is running but even 
waiting 5 minutes+ after the hard-hang it doesn't fire. Machine 
appears to be completely wedged.
The machine otherwise seems to work fine, as long I don't run apt 
(I'm using it now). The questions therefore are:
- It seems very much like a hardware problem, right? Or is there any
   chance sata_sil could be locking up (eg in response to hardware
   errors)?
- What hardware though? (RAM? Disk? Sil3112 controller?) If its apt
   specific (only trigger i've found so far) then it might due to
   one of the remaining two disks also having a problem, a problem
   which causes some weird wedge in either the sil3112 hardware or in
   libata sata_sil.
- Any easyish way to get more information from the kernel on what it
   was doing before the wedge? Or was NMI the only hope?
I'm at a loss as to which hardware to start replacing :( to try fix 
this. Any tips, hints would be appreciated. Usually Linux is pretty 
verbose about broken hardware.
regards,
