All TCP/IP sockets do share  "struct file_operations, struct inode_operations
and  struct proto_ops" structures until somebody hack it. And unlike UNIX
"struct socket" is part of "struct inode". I remember somebody mention a right
answer for your question during talking about 15000 connections per one
socket/server.
