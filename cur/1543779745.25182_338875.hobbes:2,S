Offset LVI past CIV when starting DAC/ADC in order to prevent
stalled start.

This fixes a "no sound" problem with Wolfenstein Enemy Territory and
(apparently) other games using the Quake3 engine.  It probably affects
some other OSS applications as well.
This recreates some code that had been removed from the i810_audio
driver around 5/2004.  The euqivalent patch has been in the 2.6 stream
since about 2.6.11.
