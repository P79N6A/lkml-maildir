Hi,
I did and unfortunately, it was of little help.  If
anything though, it made the lockup more consistent.  The
three times I tried to boot with nmi_watchdog=1, it locked
up when starting SpamAssassin.  Nothing special about that
process but just above that it started the hotplug
subsystem which I use to automatically insert various usb
drivers as needed.  Could that have anything to do with it?
Shane
Btw, to clarify, when the lockup occurs with nmi_watchdog,
no oops gets printed.
