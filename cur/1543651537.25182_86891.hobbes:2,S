POSIX ACLs are more complicated than what would be inherently necessary, if we 
were in a situation where we could design from scratch. Unfortunately we are 
not in that situation. I've heard dozens of people complain about POSIX ACLs 
(and other kinds as well); nobody was able to come up with something truly 
better so far.
