We're doing no such thing.
If we did this sort of thing, he would have been pressed into releasing
glibc 2.2 in time.
drepper-and-others@redhat.com did have some influence on choosing the
glibc for 7.0 though, so we're confident no major changes will be
necessary.

The opposite is the case. They didn't want to have to support a dead
branch (2.1/2.95).

That's what we'll do if any incompatible changes will be necessary -
fortunately glibc supports versioning.
