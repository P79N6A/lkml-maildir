I think it could depend on STACKTRACE_SUPPORT. Alternatively, it could
select STACKTRACE only if it is supported, though for architectures
without it, the kmemleak reports wouldn't be very useful.
Does FRAME_POINTER even matter? I think STACKTRACE should be enough to
get the backtrace. I even have some ARM patches for stack unwinding
where FRAME_POINTER is disabled (and shouldn't be enabled).

Well, it is recommended. If you don't have this, you can't trigger a
scan manually by reading the /sys/kernel/debug/memleak file (have to
rely on the automatic thread). In my local tree (not published yet), I
also added support for run-time configuration by writing to this file.
Is there any disadvantage in always selecting DEBUG_FS?
Thanks.
