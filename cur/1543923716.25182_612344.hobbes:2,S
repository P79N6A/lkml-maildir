Yeah, busted BIOS (and I agree a poor design decision).

Unfortunately I think some such machines *were* released, only because 
the release engineers figured no one actually uses MMCONFIG yet 
(Windows == whole world of users), so why worry about that particular 
bug?
The "not E820-reserved" message is actually bogus.  I'll bet MMCONFIG 
works fine on your machine with Robert's patch and the disable decode 
stuff applied.
