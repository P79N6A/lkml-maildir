You are right, the program which closes the socket after writing
the answer packet has 4 unread bytes in his receive buffer.
After insertion of a loop with "ioctl (sd, FIONREAD, &char_waiting)" and "read
all waiting chars into a dummy buffer" just before i close the socket it
works with Linux 2.2.
I will name this #ifdef "FLUSH_INPUT" instead of "LINUX22_WORKAROUND"
to outline that the old socket handling of the application was not correct.
Thank you so much.
Thorsten
