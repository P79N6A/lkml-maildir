"what's a subsystem"?
I'm not sure there is an appropriate definition.
If there is an appropriate definition, why
should anyone care what subsystem a particular
file is in?

I'd still be happy if MAINTAINERS went away.
I'm not sure what good it does other than have
a link to mailing lists that otherwise might not
be CC'd on patches.

For user submission of bug reports, perhaps it'd be
more useful to have a submitkernelbugreport script
and a network enabled "dispatch bug report" to
appropriate maintainers service.
Try something out and see what happens.
Good luck.  Joe
