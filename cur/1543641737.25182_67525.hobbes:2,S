Forgot to mention that, of course, the vfs_cred_groups struct needs to
be recreated if modified and we must keep an atomic reference count in
it.
This allows to avoid having to copy the whole groups array for each task
on modification.
uid and gid instead are placed directly in task_struct since checking
them is faster and thus needs more optimization.
Same reasoning applies for eventual ACLs or similar structures.
