Docs for the syscalls will appear shortly.

Currently no; I removed them while we've been debating the
API to the (IMO more important) per-process counters.
I intend to add them back once the current stuff has been
Linus-approved.

Classic beginner's mistake :-)

The driver sees ENABLE set in EVNTSEL1 on your P-M,
and properly returns an error.
The proper way is for user-space to consider a set of
events (not yet added to the control struct), and to
use the current CPU type to format the control and
handle any quirks. For P6 vs K7 the differences are
minor, but to program the P4 you _really_ need helper
procedures.
