I've got all those debug options (and more) enabled already in all the
bisection builds. I run with those options enabled most of the time
and I didn't change my config for any of the kernels I tested (except
for running 'make oldconfig').
netconsole is not much use to me as I don't have a second box at the
moment to capture output on :-(   So the best I can do there is to let
the box run in a plain console with the test script and then press
sysrq+t when it locks and take a photo of the output (or whats left of
it on the screen) if any.

Ok, sure. I'll do a days run of 2.6.19-rc2 first, just to see if it's
been fixed in the mean time. If it's still there I'll try to get a
sysrq+t and post that, then I'll restart bisection and give each
kernel a full 24hrs of testing before concluding it is good.
I'll report back as soon as I have some results.
