I encountered something strange that I still cannot explain. I have two
machines, one athlon-based VAIO notebook and one P4-based supermicro 1U
server, which don't poweroff when I halt them or send them a Sysrq-O. At
first, I only noticed this on the VAIO so I thought that something changed
in ACPI recently, because it was OK around 2.4.21 or 2.4.22 with acpi patch
from around 09/2003, but I believe that the problem appeared when I used
2.4.23 + the acpi-20031203 patch, which is now included in 2.4.25-rc1. But
then I discovered that I can poweroff both the notebook and the 1U by a
simple "echo 5 >/proc/acpi/sleep".
So I've added printk's into acpi_power_off(), and I see that the system
doesn't return from acpi_enter_sleep_state_prep(S5), which itself hangs
on the call to acpi_evaluate_object(NULL, "\\_PTS",...). If I comment
out this line, it now goes on through the next calls, then normally leaves
acpi_enter_sleep_state_prep(), then powers off correctly. I have not tested
yet you very latest patch, but I don't think it would change anything.
Do you have any idea ? What can I provide to help in resolving this problem ?
Regards,
Willy
