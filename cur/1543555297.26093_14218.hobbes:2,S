Quite a few dual pentium socket 7 boards report dual cpu and apic in the 
MP table regardless of the capabilities of the CPU installed. Its apparently
legal to do so. There is an apic capability flag that should be tested before
making any assumptions about APIC availability on a processor.
And yes some boards crash otherwise.
