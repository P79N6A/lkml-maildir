Subject: Linux LPP patch on CD ROM not working

Hello,
I am using 2.4.2 kernel and I have applied the LPP
0.40 patch to the kernel to display a nice logo and
progress bar.
I can get this to work when I boot from my harddisk
and floppy with syslinux...
however when I make a CD ISO image from this kernel, I
get no logo or progress bar, instead I get the plain
text boot.
In the syslinux.cfg I am including append vga=0x303 in
all cases.
Thanks
Lee
