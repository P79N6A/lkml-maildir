The issues of debugging the network processor software and maintaining it is 
certainly a legitimate one. However, nothing stops you from using the extra 
network processor cycles for other purposes.

This isn't an either-or. Processors are cheap. Memory is cheap.

It's not one or the other. If, for example, your network card, graphics 
card, and hard drive controller all use a common instruction set and are all 
interconnected by a fast bus, code can be fairly mobile and run wherever 
it's the most efficient. Nothing stops the OS from offloading internal tasks 
to these processors as well.
The only real stumbling blocks have been cost/volume considerations and the 
fact that the central processor(s) can be so fast, and the I/O so slow in 
comparison, that there's not much to gain.
