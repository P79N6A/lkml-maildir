Hello
After running a machine for some time I've got an empty directory with
ls -a /var/run/sudo/user/ showing
.  .,
and
ls -al /var/run/sudo/user/
ls: /var/run/sudo/user/.,: No such file or directory
total 1
drwx------    2 root     root           48 Jan  1  1985 .
Hm, and the date above doesn't seem right too:-) S.M.A.R.T. didn't record
any errors on the disk.
Don't know if this would be of much help, though - I've already removed
the directory (rmdir worked ok), I had to do a backup, and with that
structure rsync couldn't go further.
BTW, unrelated - does anyone happen to know if using up 300M virtual
memory, and even leading to OOM is ok for rsync, when sync-ing large
data-volumes (20Gb)?
Thanks
Guennadi
