I guess it's been the shared-mapping swapout deadlock we just know about. 
Linus is just working for the fix. If you can reproduce try my down()
watchdog oopser patch I posted the last week in this list. It will produce
an Oops after 20 sec of deadlock. The Oops will tell us if the deadlock
you had is the one we just know about.
