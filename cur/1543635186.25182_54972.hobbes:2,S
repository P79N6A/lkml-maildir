You are taking this example way too seriously.  Thunder wanted an 
example and I grabbed the first one that I saw (I created it in the 
last hour).  I showed you how I arrived at it, just a quick grepping. 
  It wan't a real patch, only a quick little example snippet.

How many times do I have to say it?  We're going around in circles 
here.  I _know_ that it isn't on a critical path, or saving a large 
quantity of program text.  I just think that it is better than it was 
before.
