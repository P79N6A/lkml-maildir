Sorry, I don't agree. AFAICS, if used_math isn't reset, on the next
attempt of the process to use the fpu, it will be reloaded with the
values, that come from the sighandler and that still reside in
thread.i387. Thus, clear_cpu() without resetting used_math has no
effect to the userspace task.
Resetting current->used_math to 0 would make math_state_restore()
calling init_fpu(), that clears thread.i387 before the fpu is loaded.
