Yes, it does speed up some people's boxes.  It's also found a few nice
race conditions that we need to fix up no matter what (MSI
initialization, dvb borkage, etc.)
But it is still quite experimental, hence the wording in the config
option.
Note that the next opensuse release will have this enabled, but it has
to have a kernel command line option added by the user in order for it
to be enabled.  It should get a lot more testing that way.
