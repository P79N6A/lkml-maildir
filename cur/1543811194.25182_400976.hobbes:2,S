Sorry, I don't understand the relevance of your comment.
As the code stands in mainline, if we run out of input data, we are
guaranteed to exit from inflate.
With your change in this patch set, we no longer guaranteed to exit,
but will in some circumstances loop indefinitely.
The problem this causes is that if the ramdisk decompression runs out
of data, the kernel will just silently hang.
Please do not back out this fix.

And the cases where it doesn't halt is the important case.
Sorry, but I hope that this code does not get merged as is.  It's
backing out a fix that I was involved in getting in, and therefore
I'm completely opposed to your code as it stands.
