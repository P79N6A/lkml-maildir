Should not external modules with internal names be rejected at modprobe 
time? Otherwise I'd wonder how you want to deal with /sys/modules/XXX if 
both modules export some module_param()s.
It's just that if I happen to load vt.ko that the existing 
/sys/modules/vt (from in-kernel vt.o) does not get overwritten by new 
dentries that vt.ko will spawn. Something like /sys/modules/vt.1 perhaps 
for /the new module with same name?
