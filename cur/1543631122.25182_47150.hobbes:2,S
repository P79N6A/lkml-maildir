Whats the best way to do the equivalent of a stat() on a char * pathname
from inside a kernel module?  Don't ask why I need to do this.. I know it
sounds evil but I just need to do it...  Basically I need to find out the
minor number of a device file.
I noticed there's a filp_open() function that is exported and it returns a
struct file *.  I am not sure what the semantics of about 75% of the
fields in that struct are.. and/or how they relate to the well-documented
fields in the libc's struct stat.  Any help/insights would be appreciated.
