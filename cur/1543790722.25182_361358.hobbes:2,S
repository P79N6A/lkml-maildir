Well...  All it takes is extra patches when incremental gets too large;
e.g. have a script pick idle interval close to splitting the thing in
half until parts get less than <size>.  The question is, how much extra
load would that create?  Another problem is that a lot of intermediates
will not build, but that is just as true for -git<n> snapshots ;-/
