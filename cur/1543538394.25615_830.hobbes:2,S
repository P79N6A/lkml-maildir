Subject: unresolved symbols and -Werror
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Since about 2.4.0test3-pre1 or so, there has been a -Werror in the
top-level Makefile that prevents building on my system.  So I've been
removing it.
Since about 2.4.0test2 or test3-pre1, I've been unable to load most
modules.  Depmod screeches loudly with unresolved symbols, but I can't
figure out why these aren't being exported.
Stuff like...
