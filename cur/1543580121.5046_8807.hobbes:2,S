Datapoint
I have a chaintech 7AIA KT133-based TB motherboard.  I use a USB mouse so
I can't verify #1.  However it(2.4.0-release) autodetects all my memory
and I don't see a big enough clock drift even with 100% cpu utilization
(don't know about high disk utilization though)
Are you sure you don't have OS/2 mode or memory hole enabled in bios?  Not
sure if it matters but it could...  Also USB mouse support, make sure it's
disabled in BIOS?  Just guessing some things to look at.
