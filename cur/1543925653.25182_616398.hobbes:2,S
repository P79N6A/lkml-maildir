I pretty much do that nowadays. But i dont expect non programmers to do
likewise. At least i dont need a couple million bucks to preserve my
programming skills.
Its actually good for programmers. In the third world where i live its
makes a world of difference.
The availability of source does not mean that everybody must use source.
I think everybody also agrees that its better then binary only distribution.

I dont understand. You are supposed to go to jail for looking at closed
source, right? And licenses are very expensive. I could not afford them
when i started out but now i would rather spend the money on other
things like FPGA's.

You seem to be saying that Open source will never be good enough. And
that the megafreeze problem is a necessary consequence. Thats fine with
me. Its not going to make me stop using open source and linux because
there is a good solution to the megafreeze problem. You might as well
start ignoring Linux and the BSD's since Microsoft is already offering
an alternative. At least you dont have to deal with that problem there.
