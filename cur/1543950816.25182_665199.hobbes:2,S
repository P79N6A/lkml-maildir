With the patch, get_vma_policy() would return the VMA's policy if it has 
its own get_policy() function that returns a valid policy or differs from 
the default, otherwise it would refer to whatever default_policy is 
statically allocated to represent.
For task mempolicies, alloc_pages_current() has always used default_policy 
if current->mempolicy is NULL.  So you can change default_policy.policy to 
be anything you want (and its v.nodes or v.preferred_node members) and 
that will be the effected policy for any task that doesn't have a valid 
->mempolicy.
