Hi Marco, Everyone,
I was able to reproduce this issue.  It happens on all the
kernels I tried including a stock Redhat kernel.  This is just 
an idiosyncrasy of strace. In this case both the strace and
tail are sent a SIGTSTP when they are put into the background.
Its not suprising that this might confuse strace.
I also tried this with a program which just does a long
nanosleep.  Strace still shows a return of ENOSYS but the
program actually gets the correct EINTR.
