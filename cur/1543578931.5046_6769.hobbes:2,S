Yeah, I just applied the patch and recompiled.  Yes, it fixed it, pretty
decisively too.
P100/16Mb RAM/17Mb swap -- run Netscape 3.04, and start some large Java
applet -- like a Java-based game or Yahoo Chat or some such.
...on 240-ac4, it works okay.   On 240-ac9, the disk grinds away, and it's
so slow you can see individual widgets being drawn.
With this patch, it's pretty much back to the way it was in -ac4, maybe a
little better.
thanx.
