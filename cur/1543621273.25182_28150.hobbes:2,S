I have compiled 2.4.18-rc1 and when I try to install i2c and lm_sensors
pkg I get this error:
make: *** No rule to make target
`/usr/src/linux/include/linux/modules/dvbdev.ver', needed by
`kernel/i2c-pport.d'.  Stop.
I have used the same .config that I used to build several kerenels which
I have sucessfully installed the i2c pkg with. Which makes me think
that the particular module isnt in 18-rc1 or it has been changed. 
What selection in the .config would correspond to dvbdev.ver?
