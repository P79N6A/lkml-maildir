I'm following Andrew's strategy. Everytime I submit a patch all
the trailing white spaces are removed. This means they will slowly
disappear. If they don't this means this code is not changing
and stable and then it doesn't matter anyways.
But big patches like this are not a good idea because they
just cause patch rejects and trouble.
