It was sent there two times.

I received comments and feature requests from Herbert Xu and Jamal Hadi
Salim,
almost all were successfully resolved.

Hmmm...
I think it is fully functional and ready for inclusion.

1. Provide very flexible userspace control over netlink.
2. Provide very flexible notification mechanism.

Documentation exists in Documentation/connector/connector.txt.
Patch with brief source documentation was already created,
so I will post it with other minor updates soon.

It also is used in SuperIO and acrypto subsystems.

So, you recommend to create for each driver, that wants to be controlled
over netlink, new netlink socket, register it's unit and learn
how SKB is allocated, processed and so on?
This is wrong.
Much easier to just register a callback.

It is much easier to use connector instead of direct netlink sockets.
One should only register callback and identifier. When driver receives
special netlink message with appropriate identifier, appropriate
callback will be called.
From the userspace point of view it's quite straightforward:
socket();
bind();
send();
recv();
But if kernelspace want to use full power of such connections, driver
writer must create special sockets, must know about struct sk_buff
handling...
Connector allows any kernelspace agents to use netlink based
networking for inter-process communication in a significantly easier
way:
int cn_add_callback(struct cb_id *id, char *name, void (*callback) (void
*));
void cn_netlink_send(struct cn_msg *msg, u32 __groups);

Because while this driver lived outside kernel tree there were no empty 
registered socket.
It can be changed if driver will go upstream.

Because that callback is used for notification requests.

I posted it with SuperIO, kobject_uevent, acrypto and fork changes.
It is quite straightforward:
        s = socket(PF_NETLINK, SOCK_DGRAM, NETLINK_NFLOG);
        if (s == -1) {
                perror("socket");
                return -1;
        }
        l_local.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;
        l_local.nl_groups = CN_ACRYPTO_IDX;
        l_local.nl_pid = getpid();
        if (bind(s, (struct sockaddr *)&l_local, sizeof(struct
sockaddr_nl)) == -1) {
                perror("bind");
                close(s);
                return -1;
        }
                case NLMSG_DONE:
                        data = (struct cn_msg *)NLMSG_DATA(reply);
                        m = (struct crypto_conn_data *)(data + 1);
                        stat = (struct crypto_device_stat *)(m+1);
                        time(&tm);
                        fprintf(out,
                                "%.24s : [%x.%x] [seq=%u, ack=%u], name=
%s, cmd=%#02x, "
                                "sesions: completed=%llu, started=%llu,
finished=%llu, cache_failed=%llu.\n",
                                ctime(&tm), data->id.idx, data->id.val,
                                data->seq, data->ack, m->name, m->cmd,
                                stat->scompleted, stat->sstarted, stat-
>sfinished, stat->cache_failed);
                        fflush(out);
                        break;
