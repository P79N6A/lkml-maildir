Sure. The other way of seeing it is that *anything*  could be a bug.
Could adding 1 to "a" be a bug? Yes. "a" might overflow. So maybe the 
compiler should warn about that too?
So do you think a compiler should warn when you do
	int a = i + 1;
and say "warning: Expression on line x might overflow"?
Could it be a BUG? Hell yeah.
Is warning for things that _could_ be bugs sane? Hell NO.

Yeah, and that's what I think is crazy.
Is it consistent? Yes. Does it help people? No.
A warning that is consistent is not necessarily a good warning. It needs 
to MAKE SENSE too. And this one doesn't.  I'm sorry if you can't see that.
