Gaaah.  This is why it's a bad idea to try to attempt to do GPL
"enforcement" in kernel code.  Your reasoning is totally bogus.  GPL
is only about distribution, and if a user is building a standalone
module which they never distibute, the provisions of GPL won't apply,
since it's only about distribution, and a user who builds an ATI or
Nvidia module in the privacy of their own home won't be violating the
GPL.
