How about bzip2 compression for the kernel and initrd?
Distributions should already be using compiler options that produce
small code. (no alignment, etc.)
One could load a bit more using the BIOS. The boot standard allows
large (2.88 MB) floppy images at least.
Since old BIOS versions can't boot off a CD-ROM anyway, the CD-ROM
boot can drop support for old hardware. While you may have an old
SCSI card in your new PC, you won't be booting from it.
(drivers for old cards can be loaded after the CD-ROM is mounted)
The CD-ROM boot can drop floppy support for obvious reasons.

Only a serious nerd would know to contact you, but a serious nerd also
knows enough to work around the problem with a loadlin.exe boot.
Newbies are likely to decide that Linux is just broken, then give up.
