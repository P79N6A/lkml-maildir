MS has been working on and delaying WinFS for years, arguing with Hans for

Of course not, it's not like the code actually matters, right?

So? Most of the complaints about Linux on the desktop are userland
problems. Adding cool features to the kernel won't make a big difference,
if for no other reason than it will take a long time for support to make it
into things like Gnome and KDE. And that's if they choose to support them,
they have to support other OSes as well and adding support for features
that are Linux-specific isn't to be taken lightly, especially since these
would be less than Linux-specific, they would be tied to a single
filesystem on Linux.

He can still do that, nothing is stopping him from forking Reisux and

Probably because most of the material on his website reads like a
commercial. It's hard to read through documentation when it feels like
someone's constantly trying to sell you something.

And what is better for Linux? It's all about perspective and the people on
this mailing list have to maintain the kernel from a developer's standpoint
and if they start accepting every new feature regardless of complexity,
maintainability, etc the kernel will become a nightmare. 
And what happens in 2 years when Hans posts about reiser5 fixing all of the
bad things about reiser4 and that reiser5 should be merged ASAP so that
everyone can upgrade again?

And you're asking the kernel devs to get a wider scope on life? It sounds
