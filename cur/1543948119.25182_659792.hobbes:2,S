I also have a T61p, on which STR works. I haven't tried 2.6.25, but it
works with 2.6.24. Both using the suspend scripts included in Ubuntu
7.10, and with s2ram 0.8 (although I need to use --acpi_sleep 2
(s3_mode) as an option, instead of 1 (s3_bios), which is used by default
on my model).
But I'm using the NVidia module, so that most likely changes a lot of
things.  I'll see if I can find time tonight to test 2.6.25-rc3 + nv,
and report back.
