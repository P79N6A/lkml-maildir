We can still remove the dynamic prio thing and the
run-one-jiffy-and-schedule thing since we don't need to give
swapout performances via kswapd anymore allowing the process to swapout
async and take credits from the bank some time after...
We can more simply schedule() if need_resched is set inside the kswapd
engine.
I am going to do something like that right now...
