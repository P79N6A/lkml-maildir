Doing stackable filesystems is still an area of OS research.  It turns 
out to be a very hard problem to solve (if it's possible at all).   
Although there are systems in the wild that appear to work, they are 
usually sub-optimal because there remains alot of issues such as 
maintaining coherent caches, as well as just staying coherent given that 
one filesystem may be directly accessible while also accessed from 
another overlayed filesystem.
Not really something you'd want to waste alot of time on unless your 
looking for a phd thesis. ;)
