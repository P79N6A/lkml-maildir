You mean like Fred Brooks who managed the development of OS/360, had
some innovative ideas about how large software projects should be run,
whose ideas clashed with contemporary ones, who became a celebrity?
You don't spot any parallels there? He whose book "Mythical Man Month"
with "No Silver Bullet" and "The Second System Effect" are quoted
around the industry decades later? And you think that's only a small
handful of people?
