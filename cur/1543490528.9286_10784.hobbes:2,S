Something on that order. I suspect we should really clean up
blk_dev_struct a bit more to contain the device sizes too as a function
etc, but basically it is not a lot of complexity, mainly just a lot of
small details.

No, it partly reduces request structure pressure, but that's not all it
does: the drivers will use the information it provides to do some basic IO
handling. Think of it as a poor mans scatter-gather thing for simple
devices that don't want to look past a single request.
