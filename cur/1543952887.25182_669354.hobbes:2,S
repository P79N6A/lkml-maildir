Hi Andrew,
Here are a few updates for the kernel markers. One is particularity important :
the combined use of preempt_disable/enable() and call_rcu/rcu_barrier does not
mix well with PREEMPT_RCU. I added a depends !PREEMPT_RCU to the markers to this
configuration is not reached.
The proper fix will imply to implement call_sched and sched_barrier, but I don't
think it will appear before 2.6.25.
It applies on top of 2.6.25-rc6 on top of the make-marker_debug-static.patch
already in your tree in th following order :
markers-depends-on-not-preempt-rcu.patch
markers-add-comments.patch
markers-remove-access-once.patch
markers-support-for-proprietary-modules.patch
