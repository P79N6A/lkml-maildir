I agree (and I ordered one yesterday from onsale.com for $14.08 and free
shipping).  The main problem I have with binary only drivers (or any
binary only modules) is that they limit my kernel options.  I have to
use a kernel they support.  Also, I have to use modules.  And, if they
lose interest in a year or so, I am stuck, since nobody can pick up the
pieces and continue supporting the driver.
I don't deny binary modules are useful in some cases.  For example, I
have the documentation and source code for STAC compression, and intend
to write a STAC compression module for Linux PPP (when I have time).  I
will not be able to distribute all the code necessary to recompile the
module (I will distribute my code, but I can't distribute the STAC
code).  However, all the pieces necessary to recompile the module will
be available - anyone can talk with Hi/fn and get a source license (they
will license an old version of their code for free).  And if someone
wants a higher performance version, they can pay Hi/fn to get the newer
STAC code and then distribute binary modules of that.
BTW That brings up a question I have: can I make my code GPL with the
explicit exception that the STAC code from Hi/fn is considered like a
"library"?
