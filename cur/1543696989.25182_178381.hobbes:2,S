What hardcoded kmalloc(size)?

If you mean that read(2) can decide to return less than full user buffer even
though more data is available - tough, that's something userland *must* be

Especially on syntetic and potentially large files - the only alternative
would be immediate DoS on OOM.  Regardless of the implementation.
