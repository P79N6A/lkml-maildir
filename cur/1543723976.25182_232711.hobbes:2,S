I do not argue with that the correct thing to do is to use window scaling
and find/fix the poor sop's stuck behind busted networks.
But: isn't it better to have just one sysctl parameter set (tcp_rmem)
and set the window scale as needed rather than increasing the already
bewildering array of dials and knobs?  I can't see why it would be advantageous
to set a window scale of 7 if the largest possible window ever offered
is limited to a smaller value?
