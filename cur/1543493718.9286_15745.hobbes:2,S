I never realized it until now...  I have a machine at work with both a 3c509
and a 3c905 card on a tyan dual proc pentium board with 2 233mmx procs. 
Yesterday, it locked up on me solid when untarring a 200mb archive over the
network (client was reading the tar file and storing it on the local disk). 
I didn't think anything about it until now.  The file was going over the
3c509 card.  I would post any more information that I can, but the machine
was in X at the time and nothing was written to syslog.
Does the sysrq work when in X and I receive a lockup?  (what are all the
keys, point me to a file/url).
The machine above is running 2.2.3 kernel (no extra patches made)
