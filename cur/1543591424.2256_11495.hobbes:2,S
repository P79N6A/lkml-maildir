Hello, Zilvinas!
There are utilities that work with PnP BIOS. They are included with
pcmcia-cs (which is weird - it should be a separate package) and called
"lspci" and "setpci". They depend on PnP BIOS support in the kernel
(CONFIG_PNPBIOS).
Dumping your PnP BIOS configuration and checking whether it has changed
after booting to Windows would be more reasonable than checking your PCI
configuration (IMHO).
