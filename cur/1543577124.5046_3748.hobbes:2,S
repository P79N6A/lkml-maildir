MWINCHIP3D is for the Winchip-2A and above, which have 3dnow!
instructions. Until recently it was using the 3dnow memcopy stuff.
It got disabled when the memcopy stuff was overhauled to give even
bigger wins on the Athlon. Which makes sense given that there are
a lot more Athlons out there than Winchips.
Who knows, maybe the old 3dnow! copy routine will make a comeback
in a future kernel just for Winchip-2As and above. Just needs someone
to find the time.

Davej.
