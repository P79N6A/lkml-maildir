If you read some more you will also see the following:
  If no console device is specified, the first device found capable of
  acting as a system console will be used. At this time, the system
  first looks for a VGA card and then for a serial port. So if you don't
  have a VGA card in your system the first serial port will automatically
  become the console.
So simply pull out the VGA card and connect a terminal @ 9600 baud
to the first serial port.
However, I don't know if the installation process uses /dev/console
(and if it indeed is the new c 5 1 device), /dev/tty0 or /dev/tty1 ...
Also, /dev/console will never be a controlling tty, so you need to
open the actual console device i.e. /dev/tty0 or /dev/ttyS0.
