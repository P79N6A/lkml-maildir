The best we can do _here_ is present something that userspace can use
sensibly. We can't make userspace actually use it that way though. 
Rlimits are neither UID/GID or PAM-specific. They fit well within
the general model of UNIX security, extending an existing mechanism
rather than adding a completely new one. That PAM happens to be the
way rlimits are usually administered may be unfortunate, yes, but it
doesn't mean that rlimits is the wrong way.

Let's work on that. It'd be _far_ better to have unprivileged near-RT
capability everywhere without potential scheduling DoS.
