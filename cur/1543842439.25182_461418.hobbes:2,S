If there were reads needing to be separated from writes, for example
in spinlocks.  The spinlock-acquisition primitive could not use either
wmb() or rmb(), since reads in the critical section must remain ordered
with respect to the write to the spinlock itself.

Right, the above example does not need mb().

In the above code, there is nothing stopping CPU 1 from executing through
the "x=a" before CPU 0 starts, so that x==0.  In addition, CPU 1 imposes
no ordering between the assignment to y and b, so there is nothing stopping
CPU 0 from seeing the new value of y, but failing to see the new value of
b, so that y==0 (assuming the initial value of b is zero).
Something like the following might illustrate your point:
	CPU 0			CPU 1
	-----			-----
				b = 1;
				wmb();
	while (y==0) relax();	y = -1;
	a = 1;
	wmb();
	y = b;			while (y < 0) relax();
				rmb();
				x = a;
				assert(x==1 || y==1);	//???
Except that the memory barriers have all turned into rmb()s or wmb()s...

Yep, similar problems as with the earlier example.

Consider the following (lame) definitions for spinlock primitives,
but in an alternate universe where atomic_xchg() did not imply a
memory barrier, and on a weak-memory CPU:
	typedef spinlock_t atomic_t;
	void spin_lock(spinlock_t *l)
	{
		for (;;) {
			if (atomic_xchg(l, 1) == 0) {
				smp_mb();
				return;
			}
			while (atomic_read(l) != 0) barrier();
		}
	}
	void spin_unlock(spinlock_t *l)
	{
		smp_mb();
		atomic_set(l, 0);
	}
The spin_lock() primitive needs smp_mb() to ensure that all loads and
stores in the following critical section happen only -after- the lock
is acquired.  Similarly for the spin_unlock() primitive.
