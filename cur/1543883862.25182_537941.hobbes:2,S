Success with the Debian 2.6.18-4-486 build, which is known to work
almost as well on the test platform as the 2.6.12 kernel that DSL-N
comes with.  I used an older compiler than Debian used for their
production build, so I binary-patched the aha1542.ko and sr_mod.ko
files so insmod wouldn't complain about different vermagic strings.
That's as close as it gets without redoing everything from scratch.
I'll give Alan's and James' patches a go within the next 13 hours.
(Alan: what *else* would you name a variable associated with a bounce
buffer besides Zebedee?  Thanks for the occasion to smile...)
