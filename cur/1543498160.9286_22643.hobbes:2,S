     Huh?
     A device driver advertising the devices it supports doesn't require
     it to be a kernel thing.  The current interface may be restricted
     to kernel-space device drivers, but that can be corrected by
     publishing the appropriate interfaces and doing kernel-space glue
     so that user-mode device drivers (or whatever) can sensibly advertise
     the devices they're servicing.

     Which is worse;  the current secret policy where the device drivers
     have interface information that they don't bother to tell you
     (unless you dig through /proc/devices) or a policy where a
     namespace is exported?  In either case, you can link your own
     naming convention to the actual devices (conventionally via
     mknod, which is symbolic links for devices, or with real symbolic
     links for devfs), but in the second case the device drivers are
     telling you this information instead of you hoping you've got
     the correct majors and minors.
