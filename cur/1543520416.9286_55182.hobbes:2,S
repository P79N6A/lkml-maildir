Dear Linus and the World,
Merry Christmas!
You said recently about BDE's ramdisk fix (included in Frank's patch):
> Looks good, applied.
I agree that it looks very good but it has one problem - it can easily
cause "VM: oom" events - just insmod rd with blocksize=512 and start
filling up the minors dd'ing a large file to the corresponding /dev/ramX
nodes.
A simpler approach (using vmalloc()) as I suggested earlier does not
result in the disaster described above. Therefore, perhaps it still makes
sense to consider the patch below:

Alternatively, if you really don't like vmalloc() idea one ought to
investigate how to avoid those ooms.
Regards,
Tigran.
