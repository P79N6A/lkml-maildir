not sure there has to be anything restricted, more so than the
filesystem restrictions already.  As from what I can tell from Stevens
there are 2 ways to pass a fd over an AF_UNIX socket.  either socketpair
(parent/child relationship i.e. both in jail) or a named socket, which
then its constrained to the jailed FS, and therefore only processes in
that particular jail have access to it.
or am I wrong?
thanks,
