This whole thing isn't an issue on ia64 (they no-op lock_vm_area) and
powerpc doesn't use any of the Xen driver code at this time.
vmalloc_sync_all is supported by both i386 and x86_64, so we can make the
call conditional on CONFIG_X86 so that ia64 will continue to build. This is
what I've done in xen-unstable.
