Depends on your programs and RAM.  If the program you try to switch  
to (or, say, part of X or your window manage) is swapped out for some  
reason, then yes, changing focus may cause said program to hang until  
it can swap the data in.  Usually that's a small fraction of a  
second, but if your IDE bus is waiting for a burn, then it could be  
the duration of the burn.
