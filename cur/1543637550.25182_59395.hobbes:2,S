The following is a copy of what's pending in my BK and CVS repositories,
with the exception of the removal of serial_{21285,amba}.c in drivers/char
(which would push the patch over 40K.)
My preferred route to get this to Linus is via a BK pull; this is for
everyone else.

	[SERIAL] Stop open() looping while opening a non-present port
	Trying to open a non-present port (for configuration) causes us to
	to endlessly loop (by returning -ERESTARTSYS).  We should be returning
	success.  This cset fixes this.
<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk> (02/07/26 1.443)
	[SERIAL] Fix buglet causing (eg) ttyS-14
	Allocate positive instead of negative line numbers when 8250.c
	registers a new port with the core.  This bug could cause
	registrations to erroneously fail, or oopsen when the pcmcia
	serial device is ejected.
<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk> (02/07/25 1.442)
	[SERIAL] Fix documentation bug for expected stop_tx interrupt state.
