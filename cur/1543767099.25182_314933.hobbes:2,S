I see the point. Just to test this solution, I tried before to modify
a test application by mmaping /dev/mem into the application address
range. Since I don't know apriori which address is going to raise a
pagefault, I had to mmap the entire memory to the user space. However
this doesn't work. It looks like there is a limitation on the amount
of memory you can mmap ?

the simplest way to say is: I want the pagefault handler to return a
memory page when it encounters a pagefault exceptions due to an
invalid address or incorrect page protection.
Thanks.
