Hi Frank.

If I've wanted a ramdisk larger than 4096k, I've always had to apply
the following patch:

 #ifndef MODULE
 int rd_doload = 0;		/* 1 = load ramdisk, 0 = don't load */
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
Also, I note the following in Documentation/ramdisk.txt which you may
wish to refer to:
 Q> The old "ramdisk=<ram_size>" has changed to "ramdisk_size=<ram_size>"
 Q> to make it clearer. The original "ramdisk=<ram_size>" has been kept

 Q> The new RAM disk also has the ability to load compressed RAM disk
 Q> images, allowing one to squeeze more programs onto an average
 Q> installation or rescue floppy disk.
 Q> Notes: You may have "/dev/ram" or "/dev/ramdisk" or both. They are
 Q> equivalent from the standpoint of this document. Also, the new RAM
 Q> disk is a config option. When running "make config", make sure you
 Q> enable RAM disk support for the kernel with which you intend to
 Q> use the RAM disk.
Based on that, you would wish to apply the above patch first, then
check that you have enabled ramdisks in the kernel before rebuilding
it. You would probably also wish to take advantage of the fact that
the ramdisk driver can load compressed ramdisk images.
Best wishes from Riley.
