Yes, and as a person doing Linux code review for 12 years now,
I'm really thankful for it. 8 char tab, 80 column rule and 25-50 lines
of code per function actually enable effective review of code snippets.
Because you can see more code flow per patch.
And enables high code reuse. If you can get within 1-5min, 
what a functions does and match it with your actually 
written down last 20 code lines, you just reuse it more often.
If you have more to choose from, you reuse naturally. 
Personally I find best candidates by code position in tree and 
function signature.

Yes, let compile remove all the abstraction overhead. 
GCC does a pretty good job there, I think.
I recently analyzed some code and it took much, much longer (factor 2-3), 
because of laxer coding rules similiar to the ones you suggest.
I even asked the developers, who wrote that code and to ones who work 
daily with that code base and they had the same problems. They all couldn't 
explain the "Why?" only the "How?". Not to mention, that this was a core 
component.
After refactoring some big messy parts into smaller functions,
identical, missing, unhandled cases became visible, inappropriate usages
were identified and even some loops could be removed.
Now try to find such problems within Linux. They should be a small percentage 
and not within core components.
So a big THANKS to all the code cops here: You actually make the 
	damn fast change rate of Linux possible by keeping the base clean 
	and neat.
Best Regards
