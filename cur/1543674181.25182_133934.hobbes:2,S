There, however, are cases when recursive locking is needed. Take, for
example, top-to-bottom insertion into balanced tree with per-node
locking. Once modifications are done at the "leaf" level, parents should
be locked and modified, but one cannot tell in advance whether different
leaves have the same or different parents. Simplest (and, sometimes, the
only) solution here is to lock parents of all children in turn, even if
this may lock the same parent node several times---recursively.
