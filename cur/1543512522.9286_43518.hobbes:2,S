These are all the patches that I would like to see included into 2.2.x.
They are all against 2.2.13pre15.
Of course the oom patch for example is not suggested to be included into
the soon 2.2.13 as it breaks all archs except Alpha and i386 (the only two
ones I have just fixed myself), but I would like to see it included into
the future 2.2.14. Also the SMP scheduler is only an improvement and so it
can be delayed too even if it replaces some SMP not optimal heuristc.
o	buffer-races-2.2.10-A	->	set_blocksize and invalidate_buffers
					may follow a refiled buffer on
					a wrong buffer lru list.
o	free_page-2.2.12	->	cleanedup the new page_alloc
					__free_page code (see the
					patch, it's strightforward).
o	oom-2.2.12-I		->	oom fixes for potential DoS
					that can lockup the machine
					also incidentally due OOM. Avoid
					init to get a sigsegv during OOM.
					Fix alpha sigbus with shared
					mappings. On i386 avoid sigkill
					to iopl() tasks.
					Breaks all arch except Alpha and
					i386.
o	probe-irq-2.3.14-pre2-1 ->	If an irq was pending right now
					it's marked as spurious.
o	mknod-unixsock-nosymlink ->	Avoid mknod and bind on
					unix sockets to follow symlinks
					(obviously right one liner).
					Probably you just did that
					in your tree as I seen
					you said Linux will do that too.
o	smp-reschedule-boot-2.3.13-1 ->	Avoid to lockup at boot due
					the idle task of a secondary
					cpu rescheduled on the master
					cpu due too long SMP 
					boot time (lots of CPUs).
o	wait-event-smp-races	->	obviously right necessary mb()s.
o	wait4-smp-race		->	Fix for a subtle wait4() race
					that will show up as an userspace
					deadlock where the parent remains
					blocked in wait4() while
					the zombie child exited under the
					parent. (can happen only if
					the parent masks SIGCHLD before
					calling wait4, exactly as
					bash does every time it spawn
					a task).
o	wakeup_bdflush-2.2.10-A	->	avoid deadlock with blocking
					request_fn callbacks (e.g.
					lo_request).
o	zmagic-only-fix		->	fix a bug in the a.out code that
					will cause a segfault if triggers.
o	clear-backlog-2		->	fix a SMP race in the common
					device backlog (where the irq
					queue packets that will be
					processed from net_bh()).
o	hashed-buffers-2.2.10	->	increase decrease the stats
					in the right place (can't harm
					as the stats will show up only
					in SYSRQ+M).
o	kupdate-sigstop-2.2.11	->	allow to stop/start kupdate
					with a SIGSTOP/SIGCONT
					(right now you must set the
					interval to zero to stop it).
o	no-needed-comment-2.2.12-final3 -> reverse some code merged
					   from the large-fd set patch
					   (make no assembler difference).
o	no-swapout-2.2.10-B	->	allow 2.2.x to run on big
					machines during heavy I/O load
					without swapin/swapouts all the
					time.
o	shrink_all_cache-2.2.10-A ->	avoid limits to the minimum level
					of cache (iteresting for
					big memory machines, for others
					won't make a real difference).
o	trashing-mem-2.2.10-A ->	use a per-TASK lowmemory bit
					instead of a global low_on_memory.
					This block very much the hog
					and let the system to run
					smootly under swap. The algorithm
					is the same, only a bit more
					biased.
o	xtime-lock-alpha	->	allow alpha to compile
					kernel/time.c (you just know
					about that, my due, sorry).
o	SMP-scheduler-2.2.11-E	->	reschedule_idle SMP rewrite
					(SMP performance patch).
o	endbase-2.2.10		->	use the EDBA to know the
					endbase address, but this patch
					won't break the old machines and
					it allows some new machine to
					run fine.
					The endbase address can also
					be overidden with the endbase
					kernel parameter (I updated
					also the Documentation/ relevant
					txt file).
o	inode-leak-2.2.10	->	avoid any kind of inode leak
					(problem with sockets). I don't
					consider this one optimal of
					course (2.3.20 with dynamic
					inodes is better ;), but
					at least the kernel won't silenty
					leak memory.
You'll find all the patches I described above in this directory:

.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/proposed/v2.2/2.2.13pre15/
As they are not controversial they can be applyed with any order.
