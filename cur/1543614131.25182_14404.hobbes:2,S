Most parts of your proposal can be implemented in userspace, without
any kernel changes.
In fact, most parts /are/ already implemented, and only waiting to be
configured properly. It's called "sudo".
The only deficiency of the userspace only approach I see at the moment
is that you can't impersonate the slave user from the main user id
regarding to filesystem access. This can be worked around with proper
permissions if you take the "one group/one user" approach, all
slave users will have the main users group.
