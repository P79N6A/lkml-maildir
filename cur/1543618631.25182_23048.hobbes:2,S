it's often more subtle then this. Every arch has to:
- implement the lowlevel task-migration mechanizm
- update the idle-thread code to use init_idle() + idle_startup_done().
  Update the idle-thread priority changing bits.
- check context_switch() for IRQ-atomicity for being called with the
  runqueue lock held - eg. ia64 re-enabled interrupts.
- add a definition of sched_find_first_bit()
- update any possible out-of-sync field offsets in entry.S.
so i'd not touch the trivial bits, because the hard bits will still be
unfixed, and who likes fixing the hard stuff only? :-)
