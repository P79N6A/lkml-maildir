That's really the second place where it would be useful. The first is
during the initial boot stages, from kernel loading to the point in
the initialisation where `hwclock --hctosys` is run, since during this
interval, messages sent to syslogd or klogd get stamped with the RTC
time taken as UTC even if it isn't...
Best wishes from Riley.
