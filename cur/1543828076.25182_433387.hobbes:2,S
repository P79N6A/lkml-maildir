Do they? There's a lot of scientific sites out there which are not
universities or research organizations. They do not have free slave
labour at hand. A lot of users fall into this category, especially the
users with larger systems or large clusters (be it ia64, x86_64 or PPC).

Except that whats currently available isn't sufficient to do what is
needed.

Well I am interested in getting the best performance for some of the
same applications, without having to modify them. The current affinity
support simply isn't sufficient for that. Placement has to be targetted
at launch time since thread implementations can change the layout etc.

If you want this to work for general purpose applications, then how is
this new syscall going to help? If you expect application vendors to
code for it, that means few users will benefit.

This is another area where the kernel could do better by possibly using
the cpumask to determine where it will allocate memory.

As Tony rightfully pointed out, tasks do migrate. By making this guess
initially and then expecting the application to run for a long time,
you will end up with it having zero or possibly a negative effect.

I just use scientific users since thats where I have the most recent
detailed data from. Databases could well benefit from what I mentioned,
though the serious ones would want to look into using affinity support
explicitly in their code.
