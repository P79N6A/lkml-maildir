I actually tested the stick, too. But I consider problems in the stick
(you mean the key-holding stick, do you?) as highly unlikely. 
If the key would be wrong a good crypto system should give me completely
different data and not just these "minor" faults.

Uhm ok,.. well as told above I'll make some other tests (without the
USB-sticks) but it would be great some people here could try this, too.
Best wishes,
Chris.
btw: What's about the dmcrypt mailing list,.. I've tried to subscribe
but no answers, and I get not posts (not even my owns).
