And not supported by GNU libc, neither officially nor by the current
implementation. :-(
I'd really like to have an explicit parameter for all these process
attributes (the credentials, chroot, maybe something else I'm missing
here; some kind of handle is probably required).  chroot() on open()
wouldn't have to require privileges, so it could help web servers
quite a bit.
Some day, I'm going to implement something like this in userspace
(using a privileged daemon and file descriptor passing).  But
performance will be horrible.
