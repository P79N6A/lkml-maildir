Hi guys,
Excuse me for posting even another message about the same crash (I am
responding myself anyway :). It is my crash and I will find why
happens! :D
I've found THE COMMON DENOMINATOR present in all the binaries that get
my kernel crash.
The offset of some sections fall in the middle of the .bss section. In
instance, look at the sections 12 (.comment) and 13 (.ARM.atributes).
Both sections are overlapping with 11 (.bss):
[11] .bss                 NOBITS       0001143c 00143c 000048  0 WA     0   0  4
[12] .comment             PROGBITS     00000000 00143c 000094  0        0   0  1
[13] .ARM.attributes      SHT_LOPROC+3 00000000 0014d0 000010  0        0   0  1
[14] .shstrtab            STRTAB       00000000 0014e0 00007b  0        0   0  1
[15] .symtab              SYMTAB       00000000 001804 000c70 16       16  92  4
[16] .strtab              STRTAB       00000000 002474 000840  0        0   0  1
Is this fact meaningful??
I don't think this .elf file is correct and you can blame my
cross-compiler building skills... but the kernel should be friendly
enough to tell me about the problem instead of crashing :)
Any ideas?
Yours, Abel.
