Yeah it should also set up anonymous mappings. Very observant :)

Yes, it is. The problem is you need to walk the page tables, and it
is fairly annoying to have to make a special case for that to be
non blocking (after just getting rid of the ->populate special case).
It is possible of course to implement. It might even be easier because
you could pass in a NONBLOCK flag to ->fault from get_user_pages... but
for now it is a noop.
Thanks,
Nick
