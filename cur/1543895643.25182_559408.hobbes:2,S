No, it has been countered many times and you are simply proving your ignorance.

Being strictly pragmatic - what makes you think TiVoland is some
fledgling grounds of /expert kernel developers/ that are otherwise
deprived of contributing, unless they can illegally modify their TiVo?
Under GPLv2, we have the kernel modifications and can include them in
our software.  If you don't agree with TiVo, purchase an open product.
 Download their kernel source and use it on your open product.  Pure
consumerism and capitalism at work.
The GPLv3 is a solution in search of a problem.  Worse, it creates
problems outside the grasp of your understanding.

Bad for us, bad for users.

Bad for users.

Bad for us, bad for users.  Legitimate laws and practices require that
certain devices not be modified by end users.  Therefore TiVo fails
and contributions cease.

No.  Outside of this FSF {academic,religious} diatribe, in the real
world, things aren't as you see them.  The fact is that these people
can get the code and contribute.  It just won't run on TiVo.  So don't
buy TiVo but use the code.  Problem solved, free software in action.

And users.  Don't spin the facts.
You are advocating things which hurt the end user, which the "Spirit"
should seek to help.  The GPLv3 is here to stroke the FSF ego because
they don't like how somebody has legally found a way to use free
software in a way they don't agree with.  Sort of like dynamite being
used violently...
