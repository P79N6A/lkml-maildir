Please respond in private, if you must respond at all.  Peter declared this
whole thing offtopic, so this will be my last response to the list.

Hardly.  I view it much more like an attempt to "stir the pot"
intentionally.  He knew that popular sentiment was against Larry, and did
this with the intent to make Larry look worse.  He accomplished that, and I
think it was intentional.  Anyway, I'll stop here.  I'm trying very hard to
respect Peter's declaration that this is off-topic in LKML which is why I
stoped cc'ing the list before.
