Thanks.  I have an update, plus updates for the mmc_spi
driver (now in MM) which you didn't update.
By the way, it's worth noting an incompatibility introduced
through these conversions and CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=n:
 - previously .../controller/spi_master:spi2 would be a
   symlink to /sys/class/spi_master/spi2
 - now, /sys/class/spi_master/spi2 is a symlink to
   .../controller/spi_master (with DEPRECATED=n).
The symlink direction is just noise ... the issue is that with
this approach it's no longer possible to have one controller
handle multiple SPI busses!  A fix would involve maintaining
the original "spi_master:spi2" name.
I don't happen to know of such a controller, and one would
surprise me a bit.  Exactly like the fact that several I2C
adapters work that way was a surprise:  one PCI function
controlling several different I2C busses, rather than one
function per bus.
