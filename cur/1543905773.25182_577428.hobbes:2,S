It can be done (e.g., to create virtual memory for running xfs_check
on a diskless machine as a temporary measure), but it probably won't
be a good idea until there is a mechanism that allows write responses
to be (quickly recognized and then) received without allocating memory
when there are no free pages.
I think if we could register a very fast function to recognize write
responses, which would be called only when free memory was very low,
and then use a pre-allocated receive skb for receiving write
responses, then we'd be OK, and the common case wouldn't be affected.

Yes.  A popular free target is the vblade (aoetools.sourceforge.net),
and there are others.  The most popular free software initiator is the
aoe driver in Linux.

I recently submitted a set of patches, and Andrew Morton asked me to
avoid the switch statement you are talking about, so thanks for the
patch, but that code is going to be patched soon anyway.

I don't see what you mean.  There's an unlock two lines before the
return.
