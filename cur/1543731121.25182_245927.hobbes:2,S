This patch was merged into our kernel tree, thanks; I'm testing it now.
Since I have you 'on the line', would you know why serial output on 
sparc64 now:
1) clears the screen twice right after Remapping the kernel...
2) omits every other character when it does start printing messages? such as
Iv vrIv unln rvr
which means
IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling driver
Some stuff, though, appears intact:
Vno: PLEXTOR  oe: CD-ROM PX-20TS   e: 1.00
which really says
Vendor: PLEXTOR   Model: CD-ROM PX-20TS    Rev: 1.00
It looks to me that when formats are being expanded, there is no 
problem. Hope that helps.
Anyway.. yes, I've asked before, but at least a confident "I don't know" 
from the Man would be better than nothing :)
