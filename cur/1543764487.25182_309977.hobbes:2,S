Hello,
This doesn't sound right to me. After upgrading from 2.6.11.5/6 to
2.6.12-rc1/rc2 I detected that my mouse didn't operate anymore when
loading up XOrg, I realized that /dev/input/mouse0 (which worked for
years) had to be changed to /dev/input/mouse1. Anyone care to explain
why this had to be changed or what the intention behind this was ?
greetings,
Ali Akcaagac
