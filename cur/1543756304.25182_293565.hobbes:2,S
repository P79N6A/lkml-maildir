I personally dislike and discourage the addition of ANY new drivers to v2.4 at
this point, and I sincerely appreciate every argument against iswraid, but I 
have no problems with it because it looks like a valid special case since it 
allows users to access their ICH5/6 RAID partitions, as Jeff mentions.
Moreover the driver is going to die with v2.4 anyway, its not like any future 
compatibility problem is being introduced.
So I understand the argument against having it in the tree: the elegant way of doing
it is to use dmraid. 
But I dont buy it as an argument against merging it in a dying v2.4.x tree which 
purpose is to serve existing users. 
You are mistaken in arguing that "oh, since this driver can be merged, its likely that 
any v2.6 HW support/driver will be accepted in v2.4".
So, its up to Jeff, and he seems to be OK with it.
