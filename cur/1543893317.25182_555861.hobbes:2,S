Point me to one person who doesn't know English at all
and who has successfully participated in l-k devel.
I'm not saying that non-English should banned or something.
In Kconfig it can even make sense. A section on kernel.org
where people can put translations is also a good idea.
I can still think that it is almost useless activity,
but who knows, maybe I'm wrong.
Just not Documentation/<lang>/* thing and no i18n of printks.
