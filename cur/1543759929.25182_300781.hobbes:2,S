Yes, breaking early seems fine for this.  But don't we need to test
page->mapping == mapping again with the page lock held before we can
reliably break on page_index?
I think it should be OK just to move the page->mapping != mapping test
above the page>index > end test.  Sure, if all the pages have been
stolen by the time we see them, then we'll repeat without advancing
"next"; but we're still making progress in that case because pages that
were previously in this mapping *have* been removed, just by a different
process.  If we're really concerned about that case we can play the
trick that invalidate_mapping_pages() tries and do a "next++" in that
case.
