This feels like something that can be done with RCU.  The
__page_discard() is the write operation, right?  So, take an rcu write
lock inside of the page discard function, and read locks over the
current places where PG_discarded is set.
That should make sure that the discard operation itself can't be done
concurrently with one of the __remove_from*() operations.  Once the
write lock has been acquired, you just check page->mapping to see if the
a __remove_from*() operation has occurred while you waited.

Right.  It is certainly ugly.  I'd much rather have some kind of 
	spin_lock(&lock_array[hash_function(page)]);
thing.
