We too run an AIC7xxx, and an EtherExpress Pro 100 .. Our system runs as
both a medium to high traffic web server, and mid traffic database server.
We had a crash once during a 'local' access to the database, which was a
couple of hours after a previous crash ('normal' crashes occur once every
5-6 days), but that may have been due to some remote access traffic ..
