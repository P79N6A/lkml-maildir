/dev/random is a blocking device that won't write anything until it
has enough entropy is in the pool to give you a strong random number.
Try /dev/urandom for an immediate answer.
A fun way to test (that I just did on my alpha) is to do...
dd if=/dev/random count=2048 bs=1 | uuencode /dev/stdout
...and then wiggle your mouse around (feeding entropy into the random
pool).  At first I get nothing, but after a while of continuous
wiggling I get one "chunk" of random stuff at a time.  If I do the
above with urandom I get a big splurge at a time.
It seems that on intel I get random numbers a bit easier, but as I
only use xterms on the alpha, I suppose I'm not feeding enough
keyboard and mouse input into the console to generate entropy.  Could
this be your problem?
