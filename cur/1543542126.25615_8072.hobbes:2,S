It was MTS - Michigan Terminal System - which was kind of an early Open
Source effort shared amongst universities, much like Linux except for
mainframes and with Fortran instead of C.  MTS had many advanced and
comfortable features, particularly in the area of interactive
development and graphics, some of which I haven't seen equaled even
today.  I had no idea that the rest of the mainframe world was made to
suffer in the way you described.  On MTS the only time you would ever
see the dreaded X was when there were more than about 200 users on the
system.  Which consisted, by the way, of one Amdahl 470 with 4 meg
memory, a little more powerful than a 486.

I'm not completely sure about this, but I think it was actually a
channel program hack, and I can assure you that it worked much better
than the current Linux scheme.
