Subject: [PATCH] Remove Comtrol mail address from MAINTAINERS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/20/13

Every Mail to this address produces a mail telling that they do no longer 
monitor this address and you should use their webinterface.
"We are pleased to offer this powerful replacement to standard email support."
Some people just don't understand.
