I've forwarded everything to Andrew (wandrew@timpanogas.org).  He will
contact Malinkrodt and assign a patent attorney to work with you on
this.  Andy's direct line is 801-222-9635.  Since the Linux Community is
basically a "client" now, your communications with him will be
priviledged.  After the analysis is completed, if you agree, I will post
the results back to the list.  Call Andrew and give him your phone # so
we have a way for the patent attorneys to get in touch.  
:-)
