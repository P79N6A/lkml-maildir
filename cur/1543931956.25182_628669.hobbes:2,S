Well, I suppose. With stuff inline, constantly reloading dx also bloats 
things up a bit but yes, out of line who cares. Do you think this version is 
better?

Thanks for the heads up (also saw the SMBIOS update to this) but those don't 
seem to be a problem in fact. David Reed has been running with the simple 
udelay(2) version of this and reported no more hangs. He moreover reported 
no trouble after booting with "acpi=off" meaning that things seem to be fine 
pre-acpi which the boot code (and this io_delay_init) is. So I believe we 
get to ignore those.
David: I've plugged in your DMI values in this. Could you perhaps test this 
to confirm that it works for you?
Any ACKs, NAKs or further comments from others in this thread also welcome.
Changelog in the patch.

commit a17ccb1964b53fd4ab00d501b7f229a9a6cf91d1
Author: Rene Herman <rene.herman@gmail.com>

    x86: provide a DMI based port 0x80 I/O delay override.
    Certain (HP) laptops experience trouble from our port 0x80 I/O delay
    writes. This patch provides for a DMI based switch to the "alternate
    diagnostic port" 0xed (as used by some BIOSes as well) for these.
    David P. Reed confirmed that port 0xed works for him and provides a
    proper delay. The symptoms of _not_ working are a hanging machine,
    with "hwclock" use being a direct trigger.
    Earlier versions of this attempted to simply use udelay(2), with the
    2 being a value tested to be a nicely conservative upper-bound with
    help from many on the linux-kernel mailinglist, but that approach has
    two problems.
    First, pre-loops_per_jiffy calibration (which is post PIT init while
    some implementations of the PIT are actually one of the historically
    problematic devices that need the delay) udelay() isn't particularly
    well-defined. We could initialise loops_per_jiffy conservatively (and
    based on CPU family so as to not unduly delay old machines) which
    would sort of work, but still leaves problem 2.
    Second, delaying isn't the only effect that a write to port 0x80 has.
    It's also a PCI posting barrier which some devices may be explicitly
    or implicitly relying on. Alan Cox did a survey and found evidence
    that additionally some drivers may be racy on SMP without the bus
    locking outb.
    Switching to an inb() makes the timing too unpredictable and as such,
    this DMI based switch should be the safest approach for now. Any more
    invasive changes should get more rigid testing first. It's moreover
    only very few machines with the problem and a DMI based hack seems
    to fit that situation.
    This does not change the io_delay() in the boot code which is using
    the same port 0x80 I/O delay but those do not appear to be a problem
    as David P. Reed reported the problem was already gone after using the
    udelay(2) version of this. He moreover reported that booting with
    "acpi=off" also fixed things and seeing as how ACPI isn't touched
    until after this DMI based I/O port switch I believe it's safe to
    leave the ones in the boot code be.
    The DMI strings from David's HP Pavilion dv9000z are in there already
    and we need to get/verify the DMI info from other machines with the
    problem, notably the HP Pavilion dv6000z.
    This patch is partly based on earlier patches from Pavel Machek and
    David P. Reed.
