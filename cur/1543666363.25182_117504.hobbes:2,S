I've just setup
	
http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/
which contains a collection of patches pending for testing and/or Linus'
tree.  This currently includes:
	- PCI 1 through PCI 19
	- PCIPS2 (for Mobility Electronics EV1000 docking station)
	- PCMCIA 2 through PCMCIA 7b
	- Serial 1 through Serial 17
Unfortunately, the serial changes are just too big to be mailed through
this mailing list.  I have also tacked on in serial-17.diff the patch
which should have been accepted by Linus before serial-1 through
serial-16.diff, but was completely ignored.  Also, pci-6.diff contains
the fix that prevents PPC machines from crashing, which was also
completely ignored.
Please note that there are some inter-dependencies between the PCI
patches after pci-15.diff which will break the kernel build currently.
Each subdirectory contains a readme describing each of the patches.
Please note that from time to time, patches may be re-ordered and updated
so please don't read too much into the patch filenames.
Enjoy.
