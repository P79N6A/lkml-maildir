I checked the changes list for 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 on cutting edge linux and
was sure that I didn't find a notice about that change. Well, perhaps it
was just formulated too generic for me to recognize. Anyway, such
behavior-altering changes should be highlighted in any change summary...

Well, I'll just change my disks to use no partition at all (-> have the fs
directly on the physical device). Having a single partition on the media
doesn't make much sense anyway...
But thanks.
