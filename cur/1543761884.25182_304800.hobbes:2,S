Actually look at linux/Documentation/rtc.txt for a "reasonably portable" way to get
very small quanta with fair regularity.
Since the original poster wanted it to be user accessible, and since it is a
contended/exclusive device, he may want to make a broker daemon or something.
Since nanosleep doesn't constrain the max time of the sleep, you get the same
performance by setting the timer the "a good way" and then spinning on it from user
space, or blocking or whatever.  Confabulating the right thing to do for
non-power-of-2 times is pretty trivial too.
Not perfect, but trying to be all things to all people, and all that... 8-)
