Subject: [2.6.28-rc] Sata soft reset filling log

I've been testing .28 (currently -rc8) and I've noticed in the logs a 
massive amount of the following.
I can confirm that the messages doesn't appear when booting into a .27 
kernel.
ata2.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen
ata2.00: ST_FIRST: !(DRQ|ERR|DF)

ata2.00: status: { DRDY }
ata2: soft resetting link
ata2.00: configured for UDMA/33
ata2: EH complete
I get this block of messages about every 20 seconds for as long as I'm 
booted into a .28 kernel.
It seems that the sata link is being soft reseted about every _20_ secs.
My drive is a sata drive that should be using UDMA/133 (right?),
but the "error" message says configuring for UDMA/33.
Does this mean that my drive is running at a slower speed?
Should I be worried about the .28 kernel corrupting my hardware? Is this 
a known issue?
How can I stop it from filling my logs!
