Hi,
I'm been experiencing a weird problem....
I get endlessly repeated hangcheck errors in my syslog with no explanation:
Mar 30 12:41:43 db kernel: Hangcheck: hangcheck value past margin!
Eventually, after a few weeks, the box will hang.  It is pingable, but I
can't ssh or connect to any servcie.
I would love to diagnose the problem, but the syslog entries don't give
me much to go on.
Does anybody have any suggestions.
Thanks,
-Noah
