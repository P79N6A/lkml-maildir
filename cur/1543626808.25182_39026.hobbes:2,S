Be very careful with loading a boot sector.  The problem is
that lilo will ask the BIOS to drive the disk, and the disk
is almost certainly in a different state than when the BIOS left it,
and the BIOS hasn't been given a reset state command.  Without letting
the BIOS know you did something strange you are going out and looking
for trouble.
But if you can load a boot sector you can just about as easily load
the whole kernel, which on startup will only ask the BIOS hardware
information and not to drive the hardware (which should be safe).

Generally MPS tables are in regions of memory that we preserve anyway.

A sane BIOS will toggle the board level reset line on reboot.
The all don't but that makes it look like a fresh boot, with
a negligible speed penalty.

I guess if you were careful you could.  The fact that you can't rely
on the BIOS to drive the hardware is significant though.
