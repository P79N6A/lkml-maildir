	Is there any reason for exporting it?  By default, stuff is _NOT_
exported.  Think for a moment and you'll see why.  Exported functions are
public API.  Protection is weaker than for syscalls, but it's there and
exporting a function makes harder to do changes in core kernel.  Unless
there are damn serious reasons for exporting something, it isn't done.
	In particular, open_namei() is a helper function of filp_open(),
which _is_ exported.  What use of open_namei() do you have in mind?
