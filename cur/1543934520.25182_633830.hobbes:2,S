We have had some stabs at changing this, but no consensus was reached on
whether it was a "for" or a "function".  My memory is of there being
slightly more "without a space" tenders than the other and so it has not
been changed.  This thread also seems so far to have not really
generated a concensus.  So I would tend to leave things as they are.  
A third option might be to accept either on *for_each* constructs.
That might tend to lead to divergance.  Difficult.  However, also see my
later comments on "style guide".

I think you are miss-understanding the point of checkpatch here.  It has
flagged this line as suspect.  You are happy it is better as it is.  You
should therefore leave it as it is as you "are happy to justify that
checkpatch failure".  Checkpatch is a style guide, if it complains you
should think about its complaint and act as you see fit in response.
Sometimes you will ignore it, that is fine.
