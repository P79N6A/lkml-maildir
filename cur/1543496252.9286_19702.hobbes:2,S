Yes.

If you want to SMP scale well it's needed (I don't think on a two-way SMP
is a big issue having a per-memmap spinlock instead of a global spinlock
but on more powerful machines it can help I think).
The point is that there we don't need a global spinlock but there we can
scale far more finegriend on per-page basis. If our approch is to scale
well as possible in SMP without bother to waste some more kbyte of memory
the spinlock it's required. You know: to scale better you need to waste
more memory :-).
An UP compile done with a not-buggy compiler won't waste a bit of memory
though.

Yes but I am not worried, and being more finegrined in SMP is more fun :-).
