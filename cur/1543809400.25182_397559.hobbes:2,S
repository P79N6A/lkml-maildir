I have a 3c509, and I'm not afraid to use it!
Problem is, it doesn't resume correctly either with or without the patch:
it needs rmmod+modprobe to get it going again.  (Which is better than the
aic7xxx driver, which has a coronary and panics the kernel on post-resume
reboot).
But at least nothing got worse, and it makes that darn warning go away.
