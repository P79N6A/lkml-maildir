It's very Microsoft to claim that the OS always knows best, and not let 
the user tune the system the way they want it tuned. And if that means 
to leave a bunch of free memory for absolute fastest availability, the 
admin should have that option.

No, that's the problem he's trying to address.

Which wait to be used when needed, rather than after someone cleans a 
bunch of old junk out of them and scurries around the garage looking for 
the right car to let you use.
Just because default operation works well for you, kindly don't try to 
convice us that there are no cases when the default operation is NOT 
optimal. And IMHO Linux is *way* too willing to evicy clean pages of my 
programs to use as disk buffer, so that when system memory is full I pay 
the overhead of TWO disk i/o's, one to finally write the data to the 
disk and one to read my program back in. If free software is about 
choice, I wish there was more in the area of how memory is used.
