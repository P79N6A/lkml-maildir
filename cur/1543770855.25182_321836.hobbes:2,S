I had a similar issue in that the power button wouldn't issue any acpi
events after resuming. This was annoying because I could hit the power key
to suspend only once. The solution was to simply remove the acpi button
module before suspend and reload it after resume, if you can figure out
which modules drive the functions that aren't working for you the same
might be possible.
Note that I was using swsusp2 and not the in-kernel swsusp, but I doubt
that would make a difference.
