If FAT stores the filenames in 8 bits (non-UTF) then yes, it will be in 
the current locale/code page of the Windows system writing them (e.g. that 
happens with the names of EAs in NTFS).
If the names are stored in 16-bit Unicode like on NTFS then obviously they 
are completely locale/code page independent.  (Makes my life in NTFS a 
_lot_ easier.  Especially since the NTFS volume contains an upcase table 
for the full 16-bit Unicode which we load and use to do upcasing for the 
case insensitive comparisons...)
Best regards,
