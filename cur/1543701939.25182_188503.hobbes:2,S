Well yes; both cables I tried worked fine with other devices, but with the 
printer (Laserjet 2400) the attenuation was obviously too much. With a 4ft 
cable, everything works fine.
Same error messages, and same symtoms, in that the bigger the file, the more 
likely the problem was to occur. Once the error had happened, the printer 
needed to be power-cycled before more prints would work.
I spent a week before xmas trying all latest kernels and Gregs latest usb 
patches, to no avail.
Let me know how it turns out :)
