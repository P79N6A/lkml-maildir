Perhaps, but I run most of my machines without swap.  They are between 64 and
256M.  Servers are pretty constant in their mem usage, I use about 75%.   The
workstations sometimes run down to a few megs free (read 'using netscape') and
I then turn on a swapfile.  But all in all they generally do dandy without swap
for days on some, months on others.
