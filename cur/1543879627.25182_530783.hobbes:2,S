Ok, I used a workqueue. Andrew, please ignore the previous patch
("[PATCH] applesmc - fix crash when activating a led trigger on the
keyboard backlight"), and use this one instead, thanks.

Ok you know your code better so maybe it's easier and better if you do
it. I'll tell you if I suddenly decide to work on that, so we don't
duplicate our work.
Best regards,
Nicolas
- Cannot sleep in led->brightness_set handler, as it might be called from a
softirq, so we use a workqueue to change the brightness (as recommended by
Richard Purdie)
- Reduce wait_status timetout from 100ms to 2ms, as wait_status either takes less
than 1.5 ms, or fails.
