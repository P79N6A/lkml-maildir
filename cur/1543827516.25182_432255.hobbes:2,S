Not necessarily.  If I'm doing calculation right then vm_struct is
currently 176 bytes (without the addition of nphys) on my x86_64 box. So
in this case addition would not result in bigger cache foot print of
page fulats. Also currently two adjacent vmas share a cache line.  So
there is already that much of cache line ping pong going on. 
Though I agree that we should try to not extend this size beyond
absolutely necessary.

It is just the price of those walks that makes smaps not an attractive
solution for monitoring purposes.
I'm thinking if it is possible to extend current interfaces (possibly
having a new system call) in such a way that a user land process can
give some hints/preferences to kernel in terms of <pid, virtual_range>
to remove/inactivate.  This can help in keeping the current kernel
behavior for vmscans but at the same time provide little bit of
non-symmetry for user land applications.  Thoughts?
