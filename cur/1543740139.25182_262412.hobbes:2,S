Subject: [PATCH, 2.6.9] improved load_balance() tolerance for pinned tasks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/20/239

A large number of processes that are pinned to a single CPU results in
every other CPU's load_balance() seeing this overloaded CPU as "busiest",
yet move_tasks() never finds a task to pull-migrate.  This condition
occurs during module unload, but can also occur as a denial-of-service
using sys_sched_setaffinity().  Several hundred CPUs performing this
fruitless load_balance() will livelock on the busiest CPU's runqueue
lock.  A smaller number of CPUs will livelock if the pinned task count
gets high.  This simple patch remedies the more common first problem:
after a move_tasks() failure to migrate anything, the balance_interval
increments.  Using a simple increment, vs.  the more dramatic doubling of
the balance_interval, is conservative and yet also effective.
