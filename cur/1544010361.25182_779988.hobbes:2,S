Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86: re-enable MCE on secondary CPUS after suspend/resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Impact: fix suspend/resume bug with MCE
After suspend/resume MCx_CTL registers of secondary CPUs are cleared.
(At least that's what I've observed on several systems.)
Linux currently only re-initializes MCE on the boot CPU - see mce_resume().
Thus after suspend/resume we end up with a system where MCE is active
on the boot CPU but switched off on all other CPUs.
By calling mce_init() whenever a CPU comes online this problem is
solved.
