It's somewhat fair, but a bit exaggerated.

I don't know about this, but if it's true then you're right,
using /bin/ls might be the Wrong Thing[tm] to do.

This doesn't work for me either.  It seemed to do the same thing
that the regular ver_linux script does.
I'm not sure if I'm getting the same problem you are.
Normally I get 
Linux C Library        2.1.3
but with ls aliased to 'ls -F', I get
Linux C Library        1.3.so*
even with the patch you suggested.

Well, /proc/version provides most of the same information
that uname -a provides.  The only things missing are the
machine type and processor type.
Perhaps a line like
cat /proc/version; echo -n "Processor: "; uname -mp 
would be enough.

It would?  The only instance I can think of would be when
ls is not in /bin.  Please provide an example.
