Didn't even the wait-queue changes take a release or two to completely
settle out?  PCMCIA is not "always" broken in this sort of way... it
has happened a few times, and each time, an update was available
within days.  There are relatively few kernel updates that are simple
global find-and-replace operations.

I've asked Martin about what he has in mind... but haven't gotten much
info.  It can be frustrating to be intimately involved in these issues
but for there to be so little coordination among kernel developers.  I
would love to be involved in this, since I've worked on dynamic bus
support since the 1.1.* kernel days, and have a huge amount of effort
invested in it.

I already include a GPL exemption to the MPL in my license, so MPL
isn't a conflict (we have the precedent already of code in the kernel
tree that is BSD licensed with a GPL exemption, in some of the SCSI
drivers).
