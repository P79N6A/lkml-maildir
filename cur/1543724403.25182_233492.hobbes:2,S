Hi,
I have a quick question about a supposed scenario.
Suppose you have two pthreads - a main pthread and a utility pthread -
both running in the same application. The utility pthread is currently
in the middle of doing a recv() call on a network socket. At the same time,
the main pthread decides that it's time to exit, and either returns or
does a series of fork()/execv() calls. Is the behavior of the utility
pthread in such a case deterministic, and if so, what is it?
Thanks in advance for the help.
