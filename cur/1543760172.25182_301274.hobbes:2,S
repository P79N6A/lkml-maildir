Hi,
We have a 8-way P-III, 16GB RAM running 2.6.8-1. We use this as
our server to keep source code, cscopes and do the builds.
This machine seems to slow down over the time. One thing we
keep noticing is it keeps running out of lowmem. Most of 
the lowmem is used for ext3 inode cache + dentry cache +
bufferheads + Buffers. So we did 2:2 split - but it improved
thing, but again run into same issues.
So, why is these slab cache are not getting purged/shrinked even
under memory pressure ? (I have seen lowmem as low as 6MB). What
can I do to keep the machine healthy ?
Thanks,
Badari
