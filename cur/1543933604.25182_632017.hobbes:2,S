If you're using just insmod, then yes, this is a valid order. The only thing that is crucial is that mmc_core is loaded before any of the other. If you use modprobe that will happen automatically.

There's lots of info on the web and in the Documentation/ directory of the kernel source if you want to indulge yourself.

For pxamci, yes. More specifically, the probe function is called when there is both a driver (created by platform_driver_register()) and a device (platform_device_register()) available. But since the device is added very early in the pxamci case, the magic will happen when the driver registers.

When the corresponding device is registered. In this case it is whenever a card is detected and initialized.
