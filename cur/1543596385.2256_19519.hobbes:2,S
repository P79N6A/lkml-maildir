Possibly stupid suggestion... Maybe the interactive/GUI programs should wake
up once in a while and touch a couple of their pages? Go too far with this
and you'll just get in the way of performance, but I don't think it would
hurt to have processes waking up every couple of minutes and touching glibc,
libqt, libgtk, etc so they stay hot in memory... A very slow incremental
"caress" of the address space could eliminate the
"I-just-logged-in-this-morning-and-dammit-everything-has-been-paged-out"
problem.

Dan
