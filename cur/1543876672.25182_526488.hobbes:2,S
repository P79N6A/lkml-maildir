I assume you put it on and endless loop since hackbench 10 runs for .5 second 
on my machine. Doubtful it's an SMP issue. update_if_moved should maintain 
cross cpu scheduling decisions. The same slowdown would happen on UP and is 
almost certainly due to the fact that hackbench 10 induces a load of _160_ on 
the machine.
