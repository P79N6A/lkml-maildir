I have changed the code to do the following:
- If the COMPAT_DIR_INDEX flag is set at mount/remount time, set the
  INDEX mount option (the same as "mount -o index").  This removes
  the need to specify the "-o index" option each time for filesystems
  which already have indexed directories.
- New directories NEVER have the INDEX flag set on them.
- If the INDEX mount option is set, then when directories grow past 1
  block (and have the index added) they will get the directory INDEX
  flag set and turn on the superblock COMPAT_DIR_INDEX flag (if off).
This means that you can have common code for indexed and non-indexed ext2
filesystems, and the admin either needs to explicitly set COMPAT_DIR_INDEX
in the superblock or mount with "-o index" (and create a directory > 1 block).
I have also added some tricks to ext2_inc_count() and ext2_dec_count() so
that indexed directories are not subject to the EXT2_LINK_MAX.  I've done
the same as reiserfs, and set i_nlink = 1 if we overflow EXT2_LINK_MAX
(which has been increased to 65500 for indexed directories). Apparently
i_nlink = 1 is the right think to do w.r.t. find and other user tools.
Patches need some light testing before being posted.
Cheers, Andreas
