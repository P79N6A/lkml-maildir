I am surprised that is should actually be faster, but I give in to the
experts. I will see if I can find time to perform a test or I should spend
it on something else.
That said, this long discussion have not been a complete waste of time: I
think this thread have learned us that we do have different goals and
clarifies stuff.
I am not happy about the soft-irq thing. Mostly due to naming.
local_irq_disable() is really just preempt_disable() with some extra stuff
to make it backward combatible. 
I still believe local_irq_disable() (also in the soft version) should be
completely forbidden when PREEMPT_RT is set. All places using it should be
replaced with a mutex or a ???_local_irq_disable() to mark that the code
have been reviewed for PREEMPT_RT. With your argument above 
???_local_irq_disable() should really be preempt_disable() as that is
faster.
