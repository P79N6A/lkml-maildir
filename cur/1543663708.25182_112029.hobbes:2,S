This is exactly correct, although build just the optimal kernel for a
machine is still somewhat art rather than science. You have to choose the
trade-offs carefully.

Preempt causes most of the issues of SMP with few of the benefits. There
are loads for which it's ideal, but for general use it may not be the
right feature, and I ran it during the time when it was just a patch, but
lately I'm convinced it's for special occasions.
