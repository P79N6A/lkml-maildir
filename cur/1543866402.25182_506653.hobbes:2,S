Thats the point. Mmmm, I think I see it the other way around. I defined
a variable as 'signed' or 'unsigned', because the sign info matters for me.
And gcc warns about using a function on it that will _ignore_ or even
misinterpret that info. Could it be a BUG ? Yes.

In fact, I tried to look for an arch where this gives only _one_ error:
#include <string.h>
void f()
{
	const unsigned char *a;
	const signed char *b;
	int la,lb;
	la = strlen(a);
	lb = strlen(b);
}
and guess, all give _both_ errors.

This makes sense.
Someone can try on something psychedelic, like ARM ;) ?
