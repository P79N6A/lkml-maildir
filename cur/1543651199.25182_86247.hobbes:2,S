It would be great if crash dumping were an option, at the very least
to unify the netdump, oops reporter and disk dumping (for those that
want it) into a single infrastructure.  Long term, that's probably
where this is going anyway.  It takes away the religious "who is right"
argument, which is fundamentally silly.
Maybe one day.  I think quite a few Red Hat customers would
appreciate it.

P.S.  IBM shouldn't have signed a contact with Red Hat without
      requiring certain features in Red Hat's OS(es).  Pushing for
      LKCD, kprobes, LTT, etc., wouldn't be on this list for a whole
      variety of cases if that had been done in the first place.
P.S.  As an aside, too many engineers try and make product marketing
      decisions at Red Hat.  I personally think that's really bad for
      their business model as a whole (and I'm not referring to LKCD).
