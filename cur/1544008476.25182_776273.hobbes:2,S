I agree. More easy to grep. Ingo, Peter, others, what do you think?

I proposed a solution for ftrace_printk (which I planned to implement
this evening).
Since we are in a C-style output, that would be good  to put the ftrace_printk
as /* C comments */ inside just below the function that called it.
Like this:
func_that_called_ftrace_printk {
    /* Message from ftrace_printk */
}
This way we keep the idea of comment which comes along the role of
ftrace_printk and we know
which function called it, at which depth.....
Do you like it this way?
