Hello!
A while ago I reported a problem with the 2.4.22 kernel and the
tiny Marvell PATA to SATA bridge chip that is used on many of
the now-not-so-recent motherboards which don't have native
SATA ports in their southbridges.
As it can be seen below, a native SATA150 drive is connected
to a SATA port implemented using that Marvell chip hooked up
to the ICH4's parallel ATA133 port and this way the drive is
only recognized (and used) as UDMA33:
ICH4: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:1f.1
ICH4: chipset revision 2
ICH4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hdc: ST3160023AS, ATA DISK drive
blk: queue c04a1ff4, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hdc: attached ide-disk driver.
hdc: host protected area => 1
hdc: 312581808 sectors (160042 MB) w/8192KiB Cache, CHS=19457/255/63, UDMA(33)
As far as I can remember someone (Jeff Garzik?) suspected the
SATA cable not being recognized as a 80-conductor thus >=UDMA66
capable cable. Then it was told that there is a fix underway that
will be included in the 2.4.23 kernel. The above snippet shows
that the 2.4.25 kernel still has this problem. Any comments?
