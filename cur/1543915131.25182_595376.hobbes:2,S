You assume a lot about what NetApp did. While they can use BSD licensed
code in their system without any issue they can not slam a new copyright
on that code unless the changes create a derivative work.
If you just do an adaption of the code you have no right to add an
additional copyright. You need to make substantial extensions to the
original work. Now adapting code to make it run under linux is in my
opinion not a substantial work. It can be compared to translate a book to
a different language -- which neither allows you to assign copyright on
the result.
I very much doubt that WAFL is a simple adaption of UFS/FFS. So it should
be clear that this work has it's own copyright. Maybe some parts of their
code is using BSD work that they just adapted. On that code they can not
add an additional copyright as the modifications are not substantial
enough.

Because they put their copyright plus license on code that they barely
modified. If they would have added substantial work into the OpenHAL code
and by doing that creating something new I would not say much.
All the comercial code I have ever seen did not do this stunt of adding a
new copyright and license to barely modified files. Perhaps the "evil"
companies have more ethics or better understanding of copyright.
