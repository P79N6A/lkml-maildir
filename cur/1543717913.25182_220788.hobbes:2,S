Looks like one of the burning commands confused the drive so much, that
it now refuses to do anything (the above command is a simple medium
removal prevention command, doesn't even need a data transfer).
So I don't think this is a kernel problem. Well maybe we could reset the
device and see if it recovers (do you see any resets in the log?)
