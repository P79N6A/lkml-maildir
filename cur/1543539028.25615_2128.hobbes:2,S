Grrr. There are STILL described this gaping security hole ? Hosh. You should
use recent enough util-linux and add
vc/1
vc/2
vc/3
vc/4
vc/5
vc/6
vc/7
vc/8
instead (I do not remeber well with which version of linux-utils you can
safely use devfs and allow root to use consoles but NOT ptys and serial
ports in the same time). For old linux-utils this suggestion is unsecure
and for new ones it's PLAIN WRONG so what's the point ?
