yes, sorry, ultra 320 wide.

as I read it right now what happens is the worst of the options, you show 
the total size of the array for the amount of work that needs to be done, 
but then show only the write speed for the rate pf progress being made 
through the job.
total rebuild time was estimated at ~3200 min
