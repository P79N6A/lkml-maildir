Yes -- because their workaround kernel slowness.
I had to do this kind of hashing because kernel disliked 70000 html
files (copy of train time tables).
BTW try rm * with 70000 files in directory -- command line will overflow.

Yes? Easier to type cat timetab1/2345 that can timetab12345? With bigger
command line size, putting i into *one& directory is definitely easier.

Positive? Try listing all names that contain "linux" with such case. I'll
do ls *linux*. You'll need ls */*linux* ?l/inux* li/nux*. Seems ugly to
me.
