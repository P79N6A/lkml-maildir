replicated with your configuration, but can't still reproduce it with mine
even when forcing as you do
  CONFIG_KVM=y
  CONFIG_KVM_INTEL=y

is this the configuration for the host kernel?
if you want to use the last code for kvm you should have CONFIG_KVM disabled

not sure which version will be part of 2.6.24 but I suspect it might not be
kvm 59.
