This could be related to one of my systems - the BIOS grabs the top 4k
of RAM for its own use, so the actual limit is 4k less than the amount
of RAM installed - in my case, 131068k of a 128M machine.
Whilst your 127M also works, it leaves 1020k of unused RAM in the
process...
Best wishes from Riley.
