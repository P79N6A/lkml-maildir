-50-34 fixed the wakeup latency regression I was seeing on my Athlon box
with -50-33, and seems a bit more responsive than -50-25.  Max wakeup
latency is back down to 14us (from 39us), even while running JACK (xrun
free) and two instances of burnK7.  Overall system response is probably
the best I've seen with the RT kernels ;-}
