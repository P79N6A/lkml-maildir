OK, I did this. Now, in microseconds, I get:

boomerang_interrupt itself takes 4 to 59 microseconds.
Then I switched to 2.6.0-test2. Testing more, I get the
problem with or without SMP and with or without
preemption. Here's a chunk of my log file:
Loosing too many ticks!
TSC cannot be used as a timesource. (Are you running with SpeedStep?)
Falling back to a sane timesource.
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 3 bytes away.
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away.
Arrrrgh! The TSC is my only good time source!
Remember that this is a pretty normal system. I have
a Red Hat 8 install w/ required upgrades, ext3, IDE,
a 1-GHz Pentium III, a boring VIA chipset, etc.
To reproduce, I do some PS/2 mouse movement while
doing one of:
a. Lots of concurrent write() and sync() activity to ext3.
b. Lots of NFSv3 traffic.
