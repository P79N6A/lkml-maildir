You think so? I think the number of people testing the 2.4.xx-rc 
versions AND the 2.6.xx-bkN versions is a small (nonzero) percentage of 
total people trying any new release. I think people test what they plan 
to use, so there's less competition for testers than you suggest. People 
staying with 2.4 test that, people wanting or needing to move forward 
test 2.6.
