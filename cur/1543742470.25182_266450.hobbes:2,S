Actually in this case I'd rather leave the function there;
the documentation on this chip is hard to find, and this
function will be needed when someone finally spends the time
to fix some of the init/reset handshake issues for these
PL2301/2302 chips.  The current init code cloned some
very ancient code from about the 2.2.10 (!) or so kernel.
Speaking of which ... anyone motivated to solve that can
probably find answers in a file transfer package I saw
a while back (but lost!) for file transferring files
to/from Linux, especialy for Playstation 2 boxes.  That
used a very different handshaking scheme... possibly one
that's incompatible with Linux 2.2, but evidently one
that worked reliably and noticed connect change events.
(Neither is true of the current PL2301/2302 code!)

p.s. Last I looked, GCC ignored unused inlines; no code
     generated, no warnings.  Did that change?
