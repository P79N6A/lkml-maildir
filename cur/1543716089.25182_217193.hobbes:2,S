How?

The setuid issues are not there anymore in mqueue (because of find_user(info->creator_id) at 
mqueue_delete_inode() time. The issue is still present with signal accounting, but 
we have a "> 0" check for that. And usually only root/CAP_SET_SUID is able to hurt himself (get 
unaccountable values in its quota). I dont think this really matters yet.

Yeap, there are some places where the "MAX_USER_SIGNALS" "MAX_USER_MSGQUEUE" names
get too big in the RLIM_INIT resource.h definition. I'm bad at coming up with names. 
Any better suggestion for that (has to be smaller and meaningful). It means "maximum 
pending signals per user".

Alright, needs to be fixed.

Not really. Can replace with MAX_USER_SIGNALS 1024...

Please do so. Thanks!!
