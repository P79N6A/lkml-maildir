Hi Edwin,
Drat, sorry. I haven't been able to do very good testing because I'm
overseas away from my normal test systems :P
The bug is quite likely to be in my patch I sent you by the sound. I
will definitely try to have you a working patch by next week, if I'm
unable to reproduce the problem here.
Thanks,
Nick
