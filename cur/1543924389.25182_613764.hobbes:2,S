Hello,
I tryed different linux distributions on a computer with an Intel Core 2 Quad 
and I noticed that the 64-bit versions was at least 10 times slower than the 
32-bit versions, to boot the system took over 20 minutes in 64-bit mode and 
then even scrolling text at the command prompt felt slow, however Vista 64 
boots as fast as Vista 32 on the same computer. So I would like to ask if this 
is a known problem or if there is some simple misstake I can have done.
I used live cd's from gentoo and ubunto and at least ubuntu has a rather new 
kernel, also dmesg doesn't show anything strange, for example is the bogomips 
figure the same as when booting in 32-bit mode.
