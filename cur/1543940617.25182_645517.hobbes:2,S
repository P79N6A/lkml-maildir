You should *always* use "-p1" to diffstat, because if you don't, diffstat 
just makes up the paths totally (the same way you should always use "-p1" 
to GNU 'patch').
The fact is, diffstat just guesses, based on the prefix. But those guesses 
will be totally bogus at times, especially if you have newly created files 
(I _think_ that is because one of the pathnames in the diff is /dev/null, 
and that will apparently throw off the guesses).
So if you don't use an explicit "-p1", diffstat will guess the -p level 
from the longest common path prefix, _but_ get that wrong for some paths 
anyway, so sometimes you'll see the "a/" prefix etc.
Of course, rather than using diffstat at all, just do something like
	git diff --stat origin..
instead.
