Yep, ok - I'm undecided about the new code for SKAS3, but it may make sense 
(i.e. no opinion).
Instead, I have another question: is there a proper reason for using the 
processor format for storing the info and translating it back to (struct 
user_desc)? I am planning to avoid this double translation because I don't 
like it. Any opinion?
