I just hope we'll never ever see 64GB i386 laptop...
... We'll probably have to write simpler equivalent of kmap_atomic for
use in suspend_asm.S. It is not really *so* deep magic.

It is arch-specific already. What's worse, resume has to be written in
assembly, so you can't simply write kmap_atomic() there. See
arch/i386/kernel/suspend_asm.S.
