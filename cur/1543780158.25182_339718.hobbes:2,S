Just a silly question, what will happen if one tries to set SCHED_ISO
(with eg schedtool))? will the program just coninue as SCHED_NORM or die
by some signal?
(btw, I add myself to the array of people that will miss SCHED_ISO :)
also, how does the RLIMITS work? (ie, how does one set that on a
proccess, is it poosible to use schedtool to do that?)

same as English professor handing you a copy of Shakespeare
