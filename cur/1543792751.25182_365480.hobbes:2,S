This is a resend of the patches I sent on Nov 7th.  I've broken them out
as requested.  Comments (especially on the copy-on-write portion)
appreciated.  Does anyone have a fundamental objection to moving forward
with these?
remove-dup-isize-check - Remove duplicated i_size truncation race check
rename-find_lock_huge_page - Switch to a more appropriate name
hugetlb_no_page - Mild reorg to support multiple fault types
htlb-cow - Copy on write support
