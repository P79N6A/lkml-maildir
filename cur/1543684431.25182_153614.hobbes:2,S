I coined that phrase as a variant of SFQ, with C being Complete.

I dunno where you get this from, but you seem to have a misguide picture
of how io schedulers work in Linux. AS works like deadline, but adds
anticipation. This means you try to anticipate whether a process will
issue a nearby read soon, and if so stall the disk head. deadline itself
has a single queue for merging/sorting, and a single queue as a deadline
fifo (for each data direction, read and write).
Where CFQ differs is that it maintains such a backend system for each
"class" (user, could be a task grouping of some sort too), with a small
front end (class independent scheduler is used in some contexts) to
select which class we do IO from. The old design just round-robined
between all "busy" tasks, with some heuristics to minimize seeks.
So for a single task, deadline and CFQ works the same basically. AS
differs because of the anticipation of course.

Nope, it's Axboe :)
