A little bit.  It'll keep other IRQs on different CPUs, which will prevent other 
interrupts from causing cache and TLB evictions that could slow down the 
interrupt handler for the NIC.

Doing it in a round-robin fashion will be disastrous for performance.  Your 
cache miss rate will go through the roof and you'll hit the slow paths in the 
network stack most of the time.

/proc/irq/$FOO/smp_affinity is a bitmask.  You can mask an irq to multiple 
processors.  Of course, this will absolutely kill your performance.  That's why 
irqbalance never does this.
