Well, after the recovery the system works fine again.

I am really wondering about the error message, as "internal errors" 
indicate for me an error in the kernel.

I am wondering how my dmesg will look like if I've to recover some
Gigabytes of date.
And btw, do all filesystem drivers behave in this way, printing internal
errors and displaying call traces when they find errors in the
filesystem?
For me this is really confusing.
Sincerly,
Nico
