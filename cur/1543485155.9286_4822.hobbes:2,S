I don't believe that mixing drivers from different versions is
important enough to retain any given interface.  Backward
compatibility is not an absolute benefit.  As we learn to improve
interfaces, the flexibility to change them is paramount.  In
user-mode, where compatibility is judged to be *very* important, the
kernel entry points have maintained long-term backward compatibility.
UDI might be a good idea...and it might not.  I wouldn't argue either
way.  Among this community, good ideas *tend* to rise to the top.
Since this kernel is a work-in-progress, there's no implied guarantee
that interfaces and structures won't change.  Now, if you think things
are being changed whimsically... %^)
Cheers.
