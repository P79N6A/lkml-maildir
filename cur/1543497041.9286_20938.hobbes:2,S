What is the mechanism and how do I use it?

That assumes I am using it for security purposes - and I am not.
Also, should I need/want to track the programs people run on any
of my machines, it would work fine as a security tool because not
a single person knows anything whatsoever about UNIX, so...
.bash_history works fine for those people anyway.
I'm interested in seeing what things are executed on the system,
and when, just for informational purposes more than anything.
