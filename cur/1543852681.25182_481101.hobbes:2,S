Neither do new versions of radvd, from what I can see.
radvd.c/check_ip6_forwarding():
#ifdef __linux__
	fp = fopen(PROC_SYS_IP6_FORWARDING, "r");
	if (fp) {
		fscanf(fp, "%d", &value);
		fclose(fp);
	}
	else
		flog(LOG_DEBUG, "Correct IPv6 forwarding procfs entry not found, "
	                       "perhaps the procfs is disabled, "
	                        "or the kernel interface has changed?");
#endif /* __linux__ */
	if (!fp && sysctl(forw_sysctl, sizeof(forw_sysctl)/sizeof(forw_sysctl[0]),
	    &value, &size, NULL, 0) < 0) {
		flog(LOG_DEBUG, "Correct IPv6 forwarding sysctl branch not found, "
			"perhaps the kernel interface has changed?");
		return(0);	/* this is of advisory value only */
	}
Maybe you should just hold out until everybody fixes their programs ;-)
