Yes, that is a sender algorithm.

There is (fortunately) no usleep in kernel.
His patch uses a more finegrained timer to tune some sending decisions,
but this is pure sender side too (if you read the patch you see that
the parts that decide if to send an ACK or not are not touched)

Van Jacobsen invented lots of algorithms, among them a header compression
algorithm and the standard congestion avoidance in use with TCP nowadays

One thing you can do now is to experiment with shorter queues.
After the PPP interface is established (you need recent net-tools):
/sbin/ifconfig <ppp-interface> txqueuelen <len>
Good values for a PPP connection may be between 3 and 20, you have to
experiment.
