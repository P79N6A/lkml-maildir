  I tried it here (PII/350MHz, G200 and Millenium I), on my both matroxes,
and it survived about 3 minutes of switching. With hardware cursor and
acceleration. Are you using hardware or software cursor (software cursor
is flashing block, hardware cursor is by default small flashing underline)
and acceleration?

  I hope that since 2.1.109 there was couple of bugfixes, some of them
were related to console switching.
