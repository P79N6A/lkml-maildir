That was the root of my concern; if the interface is more of a "do"
function, maybe we need something cleaner as the officially exported
interface?  With, of course, a better name. ;-)
I do thing that this is useful, though--at GUADEC I talked with some
folks who really want to get at a good clock source, the same from both
the kernel and user-space.
