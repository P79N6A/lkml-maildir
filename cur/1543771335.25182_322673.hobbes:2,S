Hasn't apcupsd existed for at least a decade?  Works rather well for me.
Hard to imagine better linux/unix support than APC seems to have
provided so far.
For some reason Belkin screms cheap junk to me.  Maybe that's because
that is what you always see for sale with that brand on it.  They may
have nice stuff that I just haven't seen because it isn't carried by
most stores.
