These systems simply do not exist.
You can turn the cache off on pages or the cpu caches are fully coherent
with the device with caches turned on for the page.
What platform is the exception?  Not bothering to implement the
cache-disabled mapping solution does not make a platform a candidate
for the answer to this question.
I think you are solving a non-problem, but if you want me to see your
side of the story you need to give me specific examples of where
pci_alloc_consistent() is "IMPOSSIBLE".
