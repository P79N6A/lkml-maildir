Borderline.  But the patch was pretty simple.
Also, there's the question "is this the sort of bug which distro
customers are likely to report to the distros".  I figure "yes", and I
figure that the distros would like us to fix it for them.  Of course,
I might be wrong about one or both of those things ;)
