Yes, I´ve the LaserJet IIIp and I had much troble under 2.2.0pre9 ...
yesterday I got the latest (final) 2.2.0 and without changing anything
in other files (eg printcap) my printer works fine now.
Before all Data got lost, "lpr foo.txt && lpq" said, that ther´s an
active job in the queue (foo.txt), 3 seconds later ist was gone
without any error-message or printer-action, all Data lost.
