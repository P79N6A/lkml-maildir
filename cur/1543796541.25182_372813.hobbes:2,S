	I have seen many a code like so:
    char buf[4];
    memcpy(buf, source, 5);
accepted by the Sun compilers and run just fine.  When the application
was ported to Linux/GCC, the developers complained their program
segfaulted, and "it must be something broken on Linux!"
	Just because Sun's compiler does something doesn't mean it's
right :-)
