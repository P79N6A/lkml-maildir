Well, all this is just quirks, so no real rules apply, thats why I thought
having 2 bits gives us maximum flexibility.
Specifically for PCXH I see this in code:
/*
 * It's possible for the MSI to get corrupted if shpc and acpi
 * are used together on certain PXH-based systems.
 * */
So it seems the issue is device-specific - only affects the bridge itself.
What the code currently does is disable msi for bridge itself but not for
the devices behind it. I cant inherit dev->no_msi from parent to child
without changing this, and I just assumed this is by design.
Are you saying this is a bug and should be changed?
