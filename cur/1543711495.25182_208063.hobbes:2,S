Hi, All:
   Below is the patch of InterMezzo against 2.6.5-rc1.
     I can confirm that it's effective.
     Main modification:
       Chen Yang's fix to work with NGROUPS
       Chen Yang's fix to handle file deletion
       Remove TCGETS handling and return  -ENOTTY for unknown ioctl code.
       Removed InterMezzo from BROKEN state
     Thanks.
