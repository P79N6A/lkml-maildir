Sorry, I made a mistake there: net/bluetooth/af_bluetooth.c should read
net/dccp/ccid.c. Does your comment regarding af_bluetooth.c applies to
ccid.c as well?
Also, is there a place where I can find Stephen Hemminger's work?
- Note, this is pure curiosity, it can wait a kernel release or two :) -
Thanks,
