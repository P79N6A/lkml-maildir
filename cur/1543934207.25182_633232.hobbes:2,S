Unfortunately, it's historically been provided, for over 15 years.  It's 
also trivial to export, without funnies, and it's *useful* to userspace, 
as it provides an interface sorely lacking from the stock libc interfaces.
So please do provide it, even though it's arguably the wrong thing.  The 
downside is worse.
