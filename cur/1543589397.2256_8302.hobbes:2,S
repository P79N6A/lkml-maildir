Al,
I really don't know why you must complain about Eric's sig.  I
personally like them just as they are, but thats strictly besides the
point.  IMHO, it is just not very intresting to hear you say:
> Eric, it's getting tiresome.  Kindly learn what the fsck McQ is, OK?
Especially after all of the brilliant things I have heard you say.  It
really seems like a childish move.  Let the man have his freakin sig for
crying out loud!!  At any rate, I'm just throwin' in my 2 cents.  OK,
now can we get back on  topic?  Good.
I hope no offense is taken and no reply necessary..  But if I mistaken,
then I look forward to your, in all probablity, entertaining reply
(maybe off this list though).  :)
Regards,
David
