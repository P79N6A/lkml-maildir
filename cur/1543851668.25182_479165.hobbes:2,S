Sorry, did not notice your message in the last mail and copied my last
response to fastboot mailing list.
When did fastboot become a closed mailing list? AFAIK, its an open list
and anybody can do the posting.
Are you getting notifications that your mail has been waiting for 
moderator's approval to be posted?
Thanks
Vivek
