This patch merely adds one new list to the device struct.  The 
information it provides is not devfs specific and it only extracts data 
from the devfs structures that already exist.

Actually doing this is extremely useful.  Without such an interface it's 
impossible to tell which device interface in the driver model 
corresponds to which dev entry both with and without the use of devfs. 
 Imagine a user trying to configure a serial port through the driverfs. 
 Without this interface how can the user determine which serial port he 
is configuring.  With my patch it is possible to determine the !major! 
and !minor! number of the device as well as a path to devfs in the event 
that it is used.  It provides information so that the user can determine 
which device the driver model is talking about.  With the floppy driver 
that I converted it is especially nice because it lists for the user all 
the many devices that correspond with that particular floppy drive. 
 Many user level scripts and programs "will" need this kind of 
information when the driver model is complete.

 My patch does not enforce any policies, it merely extracts information 
from the already existing devfs.  The major and minor numbers provided 
are useful to even those who don't use devfs.

You're already changing every driver with this new driver model.  Yes, I 
agree, it is horrid.  Like I said earlier this is only stage one of this 
integration.  It currently does not break anything and merely provides 
the !option! for a driver to register its devfs handle.  I wanted to get 
this feature in before the freeze.  If you read my comments you'd 
realize that my function with 9 parameters is an all in one function 
that is only optional.  Remove it or change it if you like.

I agree that should definitely be done, maybe I'll even do it (I'm not 
the maintainer though).  What do you mean by the higher level should 
register the devices?

 Device Class Model, hmm, I can't wait to see that.
 My next driver model patch will be less controversial:-;.

 Please have a more open mind about this.  It may need a bit of 
adaptation but is still very useful.  If you have any questions or 
comments feel free to contact me.
Thanks,
