Hi.
Could somebody explain me this comment?:
/*
 * Incoming packets are placed on per-cpu queues so
that
 * no locking is needed.
 */
struct softnet_data
{
        int                     throttle;
        int                     cng_level;
        int                     avg_blog;
        struct sk_buff_head     input_pkt_queue;
        struct net_device       *output_queue;
        struct sk_buff          *completion_queue;
} __attribute__((__aligned__(SMP_CACHE_BYTES)));
I didn't understand why packets are placed so and why
locking isn't needed?
