  There is another solution... You can check whether the device is mounted via lookup_vfsmnt() and the check
for swap could be done in the similar way (I'm not much aware of swap code but it is possible). So you can
make some call like device_busy() and use it instead another field. But I agree this solution is much slower
and we should be aware of races.
