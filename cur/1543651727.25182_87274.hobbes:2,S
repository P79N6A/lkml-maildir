Okay, let's just call it 5 then...

Not every kernel person wants to, knows how to, or should have to debug
the compiler as well.

CONFIG_TINY is in fact about asking questions which should reduce the
size, and allowing the user to determine space / speed tradeoffs.

The point of CONFIG_TINY, as in the current patches is to offer a bunch
of tunables.  From what I read of the patch, nothing actually uses
CONFIG_TINY, except for config.in bits.  Therefore the point of
CONFIG_TINY is not about size, it's about asking questions.  So ask
another question.

CONFIG_TINY sets no default values right now.  Go look at
http://www.jaquet.dk/kernel/config_tiny/2.5.44-allinone
 and tell me
where CONFIG_TINY sets defaults.
Anyhow, I hope to have enough time to finish up a rough cut of my
template work this week and post something for comments.  I've just got
to figure out how to get TWEAK_XXX to work in the Makefiles like
CONFIG_XXX does now.
