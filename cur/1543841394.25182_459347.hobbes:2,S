Hi!
Just... charger seems to somehow work for me, touchscreen is now very
usable (no more noise). So... only thing that is missing now is
suspend support and 2.6-capable userland for collie.
FYI, here's my current bigdiff. It is rough at places, but seems to do
the trick. Now I should find some use for my collie -- spitz is just
too good.
