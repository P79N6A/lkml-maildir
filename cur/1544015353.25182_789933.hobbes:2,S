Ahh, I did wonder about that but the way it was defined in irq_vectors and
only this code is only for architectures that define CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ=y,
I thought this would duplicate that.

If mine is not the latest, then I think I'm a victim if git-remote update
not updating again as I did that before applying the changes and then
copied it in.

Ok, let me think about that some.
