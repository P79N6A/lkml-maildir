At a recent BALUG talk, San Mehat, of VA Linux Systems (sorry, no email
address) mentioned that he had a similar problem, a bootstrap loader
that left the system in protected instead of real mode.  The solution
was to do a soft reboot pointing at the kernel code, but that assumes
your RAM is not cleared.  He also mentioned that he was looking for a
general solution.
