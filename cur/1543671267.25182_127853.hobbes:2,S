what are these? i am just curious about the change as i dont
see them (probably did not search hard) documented/listed on
gcc site. C++ ABI changes have some mention on some sites, but 
NOT on C ABI.

so does this mean that: these workarounds now fixed in gcc 3.X?
and its just that the workaround employed in kernel source (for 
gcc 2.X) is different than the way gcc 3.X fixes them and hence 
objects generated from gcc 3.X and 2.X (w.r.t kernel sources+modules)
dont mix well?
thanks
