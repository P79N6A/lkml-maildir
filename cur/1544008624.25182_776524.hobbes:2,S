Subject: [PATCH 2/6] ext3: don't inherit inappropriate inode flags from parent
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/3/395

At present INDEX is the only flag that new ext3 inodes do NOT inherit
from their parent. In addition prevent the flags DIRTY, ECOMPR, IMAGIC
and TOPDIR from being inherited. List inheritable flags explicitly to
prevent future flags from accidentally being inherited.
This fixes the TOPDIR flag inheritance bug reported at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9866.
