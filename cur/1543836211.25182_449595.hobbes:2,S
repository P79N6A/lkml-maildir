There is something wrong with this kernel. I have noticed, that after
1,5 hour some of the keys on my keyboard doesn't work... amarok
doesn't want to play music (30 sec gaps between songs etc.), switching
between firefox/openoffice takes 1 min. I don't see nothing special in
the logs. It is a CPU scheduler problem?
Regards,
Michal
