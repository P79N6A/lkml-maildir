Okay, so we have two different problems here.
One is "hang during suspend" with smp/highmem mode, and one is
probably driver problem with p16v (whatever it is).
/data/l/linux/sound/pci/emu10k1/irq.c:
snd_printk(KERN_ERR "p16v: status: 0x%08x, mask=0x%08x, pvoice=%p,
use=%d\n", status2, mask, pvoice, pvoice->use);
...aha, so you may want to unload emu10k1 for testing.
Since you mention radeon in one of your other mails, just try it in
vesafb mode...
