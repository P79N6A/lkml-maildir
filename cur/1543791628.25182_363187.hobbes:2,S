Hi Tigran,
While looking into the BFS code of kernel 2.6.13, I noticed what seems
to be a potential null-pointer dereference bug in file fs/bfs/inode.c,
function bfs_fill_super(), within the following piece of code:
		inode = iget(s,i);
		if (BFS_I(inode)->i_dsk_ino == 0)
			info->si_freei++;
Is it correct that iget() may return a Null value, and in that case, we
have a null-pointer exception on the subsequent line?
Please let me know if you confirm or not this diagnostics.
Best regards,
Nic.
