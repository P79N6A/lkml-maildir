I reviewed it.  The code as it stood was wrong and the patch corrected it.
Yes, I realised at the time that the test for null is probably redundant,
but that's a separate thing - we have many such redundant tests and perhaps
someone should do a cleanup sweep.  But I have no intention of doing that
and I don't want to be leaving obvious coding errors in there.
A similar argument applies to the patch "coverity: tty_ldisc_ref return
null check".
