I just noticed that file "rc.hints" mentioned in modules.txt
does not exist anywhere in the module utilities package.
I looked in modutils-2.4.2 as documented in Changes.
If rc.hints really doesn't exist, perhaps the sentence in
parenthesis should be removed, since it doesn't assist the reader.
The following text is from modules.txt:
To use modprobe successfully, you generally place the following
command in your /etc/rc.d/rc.S script.  (Read more about this in the
"rc.hints" file in the module utilities package, "modutils-x.y.z.tar.gz".)
