There are multiple reasons:
* Easier reviewing.  One cannot easily distinguish between writing to 
normal kernel virtual memory and "magic" memory that produces magicaly 
side effects such as initiating DMA of a net packet.
* Compiler safety.  As the code is written now, you have no guarantees 
that the compiler won't combine two stores to the same location, etc. 
Accessor macros are a convenient place to add compiler barriers or 
'volatile' notations that the MPC8xx code lacks.
* Maintainable.  foo_read[bwl] or foo_read{8,16,32} are preferred 
because that's the way other bus accessors look like -- yes even 
embedded SoC buses benefit from these code patterns.  You want your 
driver to look like other drivers as much as possible.
* Convenience.  The accessors can be a zero overhead memory read/write 
at a minimum.  But they can also be convenient places to use special 
memory read/write instructions that specify uncached memop, compiler 
barriers, memory barriers, etc.
