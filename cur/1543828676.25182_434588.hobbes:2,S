Dear All:
Recently my company, sis, releases some new platforms for intel socket 775,
and AMD socket 939. I have read the MAINTAINERS and cannot find someone whom
I can let him help me to add the pci device id. 
If someone knows who takes charge of this part, please let me know.
Thanks a lot!!
cckuo
