That's amazing it never got fixed before !
I still remembered this problem being discussed, and finally found
the thread :
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/11/14/55
In fact, no code was proposed and 2.6 got fixed later, then stopped
using kernel_thread() so nearly nobody might have noticed it :

I've read somewhere that the module loading code might be affected too.

Thanks for this patch, I know this problem caught me at least one !
