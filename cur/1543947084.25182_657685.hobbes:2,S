That was not a joke, I ment it.  Do you have proof that the majority of
patches going into the kernel tree are not reviewed by at least 2
people?  Now they might not be 2 people that you personally like/agree
with, but that's a totally different topic...
And I'm with Linus on this one, it's much easier to work on driver fixes
together with others, when they are in the kernel tree.
Although I do like the checkpatch.pl script, it has helped me in making
it easier to clean up some vendor-provided drivers recently, finding
some obvious coding style issues that I had missed the first pass
through.
thanks,
