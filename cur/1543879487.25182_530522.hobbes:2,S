I was expecting the usage in the normal case to be the Al Viro style
with shared subtrees setup for each user, with the shared subtree marked
with user-mounts-allowed.  Then on login pam would unshare the namespace
and restrict the user to their specific portion of the shared subtree.
If you don't use multiple mount namespaces all of the users have to
agree on what they want the non-privileged part of the namespace
to look like.
If you don't use shared subtrees you have to deal with all of the
joys of implementing enter, or else multiple logins from the same user
have problems.
