This is a `transamit reclaim' error.  It is almost always
caused by this host being in half-duplex mode, and another
host on the network being in full-duplex mode.
It's a fairly common problem - I think I'll special-case
the error message...
Yu should check your network thoroughly, decide whether
you're supposed to be running half- or full-duplex.  Review
the vortex archives at 
http://www.scyld.com/mailman/listinfo/vortex
If that yields no joy, please send a report as described
in the final section of 
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/vortex.txt
to vortex@scyld.com and we'll work on it.
Thanks.
