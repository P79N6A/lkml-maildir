Aside from those being about the least interesting drivers in the
tree, that's pretty neat.
The docbook infrastructure probably needs to figure out a way to pick
up this stuff automatically if it's not otherwise tied in.
With Python, I can do pydoc foo.py or pydoc foo/ and immediately get
browsable extracted docs in $PAGER for the associated file or
directory. Would be nice to get a little closer to that here.
