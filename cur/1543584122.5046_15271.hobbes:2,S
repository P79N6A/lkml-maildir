Nope, there is a "sequencer reject" is not present.  SCSI drives do not store
sensitive, driver controller private, information in a user accessible
location.
Now, it may be possible to really mess up a drive with the write buffer
command to attempt to download new firmware.  One hopes that the
manufacturers include some sanity checking to prevent short firmware
writes, bad checksum, etc from rendering the drive useless.
Typically what happens is that the user confuses a partition table overwrite
with the drive having been rendered useless.  Of course, there is always
a chance for firmware bugs, but I've never been bit by one.
