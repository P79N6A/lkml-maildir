This seems to be a bug in my tmscsim driver, which is triggered by the slab
poisoning in the late AC patches. Unfortunately the ksymoops did not resolve
the addresses of the tmscsim module. From my look at it the Oops is in
dc390_RewaitSRB or dc390_SRBdone. So there is a problem with the SRB (SCSI
Request Block) queuing. 
I will have a close look at it!
Please note that I'm about to release 2.0e where I reworked the command
queueing. I will install ac patches in order to see, whether I did recreate
that bug. If you want to test it, please look out for 2.0d12 on my web page:
