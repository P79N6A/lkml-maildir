Hi,
same problem over here. Why does the newest kernel contain an old version of
the 3w-9xxx driver? 
We are having performance problems using a 9550SX controller. Read
throughput (measured with hdparm) is worse than on a Desktop system. We are
considering trying to replace it with the newest driver from 3ware.com.
Greetz,
Martin
