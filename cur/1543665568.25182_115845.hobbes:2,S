Subject: 2.4: high system load with SG_IO on IDE-SCSI: PIO?

Hi,
I have seen readcd ("sg driver 3.2.0") use 96% system time for a readcd
-c2scan on IDE-SCSI (ATAPI CD-ROM, Plextor PX-4824TA 1.04, UDMA/33),
Linux 2.4.19+SuSE patches (k_athlon-2.4.19-167).
...
ioctl(3, 0x2285, 0xbfffec20)            = 0
...
The same application on a real SCSI-device with SCSI host adaptor
(aic7xxx FWIW) is way below 5% system CPU time.
Might SG_IO use PIO on ATAPI CD-ROMs? If so, are there patches to enable
DMA? Is this at all possible with SG_IO?
I find 96% system load is way too high for modern hardware. (Duron/700
that is, VIA 82C686a).
Thanks in advance,
