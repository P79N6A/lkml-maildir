I thought that this was a function of the SCSI BIOS? I know that with the
Adaptec AHA-x940xx and AIC-78x0 you can tell the card/chip to spin up the
drives after individually-configurable delays, and then continue booting the
system once all the drives have spun up. Does your card/chip have a similar
feature?
