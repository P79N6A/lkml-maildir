OK, in directories we have:
. = Current Directory
.. = Parent Directory
how about ... = Streams directory
So for each filename in . Directory
there is a ...\filename\ directory where there can be many streams.
Just an idea.  It is similar to the current apple fs implementation.  However, I think there will be less name conflicts.
