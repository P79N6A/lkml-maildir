Didn't help, the messages remain the same (tried with vga=0x318 and 
video=intelfb:1024x768-32@60,mtrr=0 vga=0x318).
Boot:
intelfb: 00:02.0: Intel(R) 852GM, aperture size 128MB, stolen memory 8060kB
intelfb: Non-CRT device is enabled ( LVDS port ).  Disabling mode switching.
intelfb: Initial video mode is 1024x768-32@60.
intelfb: Changing the video mode is not supported.
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
Starting X:
mtrr: base(0xe0020000) is not aligned on a size(0x300000) boundary
[drm:drm_unlock] *ERROR* Process 2976 using kernel context 0
First time I switch from X to VC:
intelfb: Changing the video mode is not supported.
intelfb: ring buffer : space: 6024 wanted 65472
intelfb: lockup - turning off hardware acceleration
Other suggestions?
