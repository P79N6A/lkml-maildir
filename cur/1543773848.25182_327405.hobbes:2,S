The Linux system isn't the greatest in the world, but here's reality: 
when a merge is imminent, a lot more attention is paid.
Andrew regularly uses this knowledge of human psychology to his (and 
Linux's) benefit :)
The MAJOR downside is that merge-stopping issues are sometimes ignored 
until an upstream merge is imminent.
If you want to get your code merged, you gotta work with the system, and 
LISTEN to the feedback.
