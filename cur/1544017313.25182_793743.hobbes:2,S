Right, but it wasn't clearly stated what the issue was, and there seem
to be two with that testcase
 1) the total running time increases
 2) it causes some severe latency spikes
Now why it was stuck in with that iowait thing I have no clue, as it
doesn't do anything with iowait, I ran the thing (well, both things) and
iowait is 0%.
Of course we'll try and fix these issues -- but as far as I'm concerned
its utterly unrelated to the iowait thing.

anywhere.
