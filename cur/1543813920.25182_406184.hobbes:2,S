Hello all,
Distributed semaphores, messages, and shared memory segments now work on a 
network. You can download the DIPC 2.1 Beta 1 package from 
http://cs.uwindsor.ca/~kamran/downloads.html
 and run the dipc.install 
script. Please let me know of any problems.
Note: Only the i386 code is in beta state. SPARC, Alpha, m68k, and ARM 
modifications should be considered alpha code. I have partially modified 
MIPS, PPC, and X86_64, and I expect them to need more work. Please let me 
know if you tried DIPC on any of these architectures.
Thanks.
-Kamran
