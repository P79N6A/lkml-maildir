I did one some time ago for my own noidletick patch. Can probably dig
it out again. It just profiled which timers interrupted idle.
Executive summary for my laptop: worst was the keyboard driver (it ran
some polling driver to work around some hardware bug, but fired very
often) , followed by the KDE desktop (should be mostly
fixed now, I complained) and the X server and some random kernel 
drivers.
I haven't checked recently if keyboard has been fixed by now.
