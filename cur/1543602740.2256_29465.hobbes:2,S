is this really necessary after introducing the unwakeup logic? What do
you get if you allow at max 1 softirq pass as before?

"confusing" for you maybe, not for me, but I don't care about this one
anyways :).

only detail: ksoftirqd can show up as sleeping from /proc while it's
runnable but I don't think it's a problem and saving the state
clobbering is probably more sensible.
no other obvious issue, except I preferred to wait each ksoftirqd to
startup succesfully to be strictier and I'd also put an assert after
the schedule() to verify ksoftirqd is running in the right cpu.
