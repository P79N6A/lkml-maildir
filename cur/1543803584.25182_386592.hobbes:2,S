It would be helpful if you could isolate the exact changeset that
introduces the regression. You can use git bisect for that. Please
refer to the following URL for details:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/howto/isolate-bugs-with-bisect.txt
Also note that changeset for pre 2.6.11-rc2 kernels are in
old-2.6-bkcvs git tree. If you are new to git, you can find a good
introduction here:

 Thanks.
