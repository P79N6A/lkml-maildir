There's something called the NMI watchdog, that will print debugging
messages out if it finds the system has hard locked. The short version
is that you should add "nmi_watchdog=1" (no quotes) to the line in
GRUB that has the kernel options. That assumes you have an APIC on the
system. If that's not the case (you're on Uniprocessor, and no APIC)
then you can try nmi_watchdog=2 instead. That'll only work on some
systems, though.
Better docs (than my cheesy writeup) are in
Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt in the kernel source distribution.
