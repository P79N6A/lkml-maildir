I've been thinking about working on a CONFIG_TINY for ages and would love to
have somebody else beat me to do this, as currently I'm too busy saving old
network protocols and with a backlog of patches for general network
infrastructure (clean up include/linux/skbuff.h so that it doesn't have any
reference to specific protocols, in the same way that I did for
include/net/sock.h) and macroising access to stats in tcp/ip so that we can
be preempt friendly.
I have also __initstr patches to free more memory after boot by moving the
strings in __init functions to .data.init section that will help with
embedded stuff as well. Some of the strings are passed to things like
register_chrdev and would require changes in those register functions to
copy the string passed as it will be freed after boot, etc.
