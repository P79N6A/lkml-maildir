Just to be clear: I do really like SLUB of course. And if that was able
to get as good or nearly as good (for appropriate values of nearly) memory
efficiency as SLOB in relevant situations, that would be fantastic and
SLOB could go away.
I don't really have a good knowledge of small memory devices being used,
other than apparently they can boot with 2MB (maybe less with nommu?). So
even a few K could be very significant for these.
