HI
I have an asus MB with intel 925XE chipset and hyperthreading capable CPU.
Certain lockups with random oops occur all through kernel 2.6.16.19. Some of
lockups are SMP only oopses (sorry but I didn't catch them exactly to a file),
other are usually like this attached file
As a general rule, if both
1) SMP
2) EHCI (usb 2.0)
Are enabled and USB2.0 devices are used frequently, then
kernel lockup appear between few minutes and 1 day. It is very annoying
Disabling either SMP or the EHCI fixes the lockups. Probably some
missing spin_lock or whatever in EHCI...
