Hi Andrew,
No matter how you look at this problem, you still need to have _some_
sort of reserve, and limit access to it.  We extend existing methods,
you are proposing to what seems like an entirely new reserve
management system.  Great idea, maybe, but it does not solve the
deadlocks.  You still need some organized way of being sure that your
reserve is as big as you need (hopefully not an awful lot bigger) and
you still have to make sure that nobody dips into that reserve further
than they are allowed to.
So translation: reclaim from "easily freeable" lists is an
optimization, maybe a great one.  Probably great.  Reclaim from atomic
context is also a great idea, probably. But you are talking about a
whole nuther patch set.  Neither of those are in themselves a fix for
these deadlocks.
Regards,
Daniel
