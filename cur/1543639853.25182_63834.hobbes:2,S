That would be entrapment.  When they submit the patch, they're giving you an 
implied license to use it, even if they don't SAY so, just because they 
voluntarily submitted it and can't claim to be surpised it was then used, or 
that they didn't want it to be.  You could put up a heck of a defense in 
court on that one.
It's people who submit patches that use OTHER people's patents you have to 
worry about, and that's something you just can't filter for with the patent 
numbers rapidly approaching what, eight digits?

Such a clause is what IBM insisted on having in ITS open source license.  You 
sue, your rights under this license terminate, which is basically automatic 
grounds for a countersuit for infringement.
(IBM has a lot of lawyers, and they pay them a lot of money.  It's 
conceivable they may actually have a point from time to time... :)
