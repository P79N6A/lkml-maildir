Do you plan to use that callback for priority inheritance?
If so: It would lead to an recursive algorithm. That is not very nice in
the kernel with a limited call-stack. It is not so much a problem if the
mechanism is used in the kernel only, but if it is used for user-space
locking, which can have unlimited neesting, it is potential problem.
