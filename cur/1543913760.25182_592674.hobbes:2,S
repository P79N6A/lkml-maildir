If it is really your intention that "everyone" warns external module 
authors in advance, the interesting part of the process are patches 
like commit 7d12e780e003f93433d49ce78cfedf4b4c52adc5 that break the API 
for virtually every module.
EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL can't handle such API changes, you'll need to add 
other parts to the process. In this case it would most likely require 
adding a new IRQ API plus new APIs in several subsystems where structs 
changed, mantaining both in parallel for some time, and then dropping 
the older ones after some time.
What we lose is a bit of flexibility when changing kernel code plus a 
bit of time when adding replacement APIs and maintaining both in 
parallel.
