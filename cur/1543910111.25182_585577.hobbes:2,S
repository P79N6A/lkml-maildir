I think they would both be equally ugly, but the atomic_read_volatile
variant would be more prone to subtle bugs because of the weird
implementation.
And it would be more ugly than introducing an order(x) statement for
all memory operations, and adding an order_atomic() wrapper for it
for atomic types.

Firstly, why is it ugly? It's nice because of those nice explicit
statements there that give us a good heads up and would have some
comments attached to them (also, lack of the word "volatile" is
always a plus).
Secondly, what sort of code would do such a thing? In most cases,
it is probably riddled with bugs anyway (unless it is doing a
really specific sequence of interrupts or something, but in that
case it is very likely to either require locking or busy waits
anyway -> ie. barriers).

Just don't use the word volatile, and have barriers both before
and after the memory operation, and I'm OK with it. I don't see
the point though, when you could just have a single barrier(x)
barrier function defined for all memory locations, rather than
this odd thing that only works for atomics (and would have to
be duplicated for atomic_set.
