Here's the patch as an attachment (hopefully no one minds the attachment).
Anyways the detection loops being copied was annoying me as I went to copy
another 14lines of code to add support for Vendor 0x134a and Device Id
0x0002. So I added a table. Anyways, this driver is still a mess but at
least this gets rid of a few lines of code :)
