It seems reasonable to me to require that drivers have at least
stub "it's actually OK to do nothing here" suspend/resume methods.

Or as I put it earlier, a clean failure right at the "suspend/resume
method missing" point is more robust than unpredictable failures much
later (long after that actual failure points).
