Hi Yoav:
I am sort of back, sorry for not getting back earlier but there i am sort
of juggling a couple of things right now ;)
Any how, here is a slightly different approach to our problem that may
solve some of these issues:
Maintain a seperate key-pair list seperately with an expiry, say with an
entropy factor determining the hard limit on the number of elements in the
list of the key-pair.
Take a page-based unique id, and map it to the keylist using some type of
bucket hashing scheme.
Add a page to a key's pagelist until a particular upper limit at which
case the key is flagged as retired and only will be used to decrypt any
pending pages, a new key will be added in its place.
A key may also retire after a soft timeout.  We can have kswapd or a
sibling run through the list and retire keys in one shot, or during a BH.
Round-robin :-) between keys.  The number of keys maintained and the
overhead etc. at a given time can now be significantly tuned by the system
administrator based on the exact resource requirements.
What do you think?
Ahmed.
