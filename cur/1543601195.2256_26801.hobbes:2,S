You're absolutely right.  My patch is aggressive.  It does things that would
require buy-in by a lot of people.  Your patch is much safer.
But I doubt very much that SIGIO style readiness notification will ever
be used with files.  aio_{read,write} style completion notification is
much more appropriate for file I/O, and my proposal (if I make it) will not
affect that.

That's a good thing, yes.

I disagree there.  My patch's updates are just as cheap as yours, and
programs which use si_band instead of si_code are potentially unaffected by my
patch; it's possible to write programs that work identically with or without
my patch.  (My Poller_sigio.cc is such a program.)

Agreed.  It is messy to have to go out and 'fix' existing programs to 
be compatible with a proposed interface change like this.  You are absolutely
right to avoid the kind of change I made.
On the other hand, my change might in the long run yield both a simpler
kernel and simpler userland programs.  That's the only reason I am playing
with this approch.  I'm not seriously proposing it as yet.  I only posted it
so you could see how I addressed the first two kinds of oops'es; the fixes
should be similar in your patch.
Thanks again for creating and maintaining your patch!  I look forward to
stress-testing the next version.
