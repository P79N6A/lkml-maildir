Indeed.

May-be some kernel projects are still avoiding what you called
M$-thinking, but userland seems to have been definitely converted.

The initial decision was indeed unclever, but once a feature has been made
available it gets hard to remove it.

Indeed, it does not.
Only PCI device drivers need to recognize the devices they want to attach,
and they didn't need human understandable text for that, thanks to the
clean PCI specifications.

Agreed.

That is one of the possible question about /proc/pci and if decision is
taken to remove it, we must allow time to userland softwares that still
rely on this feature for being converted to the replacement feature (that
already exists). It is too late in my opinion for 2.4. May-be, this should
be announced at the starting of a development phase and not at the end. 
Did I miss this announcement ?
By the way, if I read in a couple of days that /proc/pci is dropped, I
would not complain at all. ;-)
