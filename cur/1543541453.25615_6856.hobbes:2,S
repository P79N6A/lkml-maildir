Good question ;-) I (unclearly) meant that if you reran this routine
after it failed with an error in order to try to make more progress, it
will overwrite these pointers losing storage.  A common source of false
positives for this check is kernel routines that, on a retry attempt,
only allocate memory for null pointers.

Ah.  Thanks.

Same thing as above.

It gives a message for each unique return-with-error path that has
unfreed storage.

Great; thanks for letting us know!
