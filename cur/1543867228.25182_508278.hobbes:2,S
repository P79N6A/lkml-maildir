does not look like good advice for return code handling. Return code
seems to be:
- ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) if debugfs is disabled
- NULL if debugfs is enabled and something went wrong
- !NULL and !IS_ERR if debugfs is enabled and all went fine
That makes it easy to get return code checking wrong (especially
considering the comment above), and a number of callers do get it wrong.
How about changing the return code behaviour of the debugfs code, either
1. return NULL if debugfs is disabled or something went wrong, !NULL
   else or
2. return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) if debugfs is disabled, ERR_PTR(-ESOMEERROR)
   if something went wrong or a proper dentry if everything went fine?
At the very least we should change the misleading comment.
