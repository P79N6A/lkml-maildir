Why do you have that "dig" pointer at all? It's not really used.
Why not just do
	+	char digit;
	...
	+	digit = str;
	+	if (digit == '-')
	+		digit = str[1];
(and maybe it should also test for whether signed stuff is even alloed or 
not, ie maybe the test should be "if (is_sign && digit == '-')" instead)
