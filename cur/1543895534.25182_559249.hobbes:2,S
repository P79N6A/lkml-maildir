It would be nice if you could test it with the exact same
hardware ... I am pretty sure it should be reproducable then *cough*

The reason I react a bit late to your post is because in the meantime
I set up a serial console and figured out how to boot that way... and
captured the boot messages.
I will add that to one of the other posts, because as a result of
what they posted there I added agp=off - and that (indeed) makes it
possible for me to boot. Please see my next post thus.
