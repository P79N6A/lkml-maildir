I have investigated it, but it didn't seem to allow the boot order set by
user in sym53c8xx HBA NVRAMs to be applied, breaking as a result all
systems depending on it. Since it is transparently handled by the
sym53c8xx driver and just behaves _as_ user expects, my guess is that
numerous users may just have their system relying on it.

Propose a kernel API that does not break more features that it adds and I
will be glad to use it.
