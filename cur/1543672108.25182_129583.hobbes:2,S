  Wow.  Three whitespace violations on one line:
        - no space after 'if'
        - space between function and args
        - no space around '==' operator
I know you didn't write that, I just had to comment because it almost
hurts to look at it...

  Doesn't this need a fourth parameter here instead of just
removing the comma?
