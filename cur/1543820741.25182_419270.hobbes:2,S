I would guess the advantage is easier administration. e.g. I always
found it a PITA to synchronize files like /etc/resolv.conf and similar
files into chroots.
It's similar as to why managing a single machine is much easier
than a cluster. Chroots already get you many of the drawbacks from
a cluster. That said it has its places, but chroot is not always
the answer.

Current chroot is probably not strong enough - if someone gets root
inside it it is easy to escape.

I suppose it needs at least to use the proper vfsmounts instead of
walking the global list. That would need better hooks. And probably 
some caching (trying to match dentries directly?) to get better performance.
Regarding the basic use of pathnames I don't see a big problem. After
all the kernel uses dentries for everything too and dentries are
just a special form of path name too.
