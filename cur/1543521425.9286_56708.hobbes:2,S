Or you just implement those few libc functions you really need. For an
example, look at the micro-shell I once wrote for the linux-7k project,
when I didn't even have a libc to link with:
ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/psion/ush-2.tar.gz
$ arm-linux-size ush.arm 
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   1980       0       4    1984     7c0 ush.arm
Also, there are probably plenty of libc functions that don't pull in
huge additional components, so you don't really have to do everything
yourself.
