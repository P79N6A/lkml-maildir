But the swap count can be increased by anybody without having the page
lock. So the check triggers and is bogus. See my old patch.

I cannot follow you here. How can we have a swap cache entry if there
is no swap entry. . . . Oh stop you mean swapin_readahead does swap in
some totally bogus page into the swap cache after we did
__get_swap_page? I never thought about that!

OK I will look into that.
