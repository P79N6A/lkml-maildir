Unless someone sees a problem with the patch, here it is.  I noticed
that I unlocked the lock->wait_lock when I should not have.  (scares me
since I'm currently running the kernel with that bug!)
Ingo,  in the pi_setprio, I can stop the loop if the owner of the BKL
has a task lock_depth >= 0 correct?  This means that the owner is either
running, or is going to go to sleep.  If it was blocked on another task,
via a mutex, then this count would be -1.  Correct?  I may need to move
the setting of lock_depth = -1 to inside the protection of the task
pi_lock.
