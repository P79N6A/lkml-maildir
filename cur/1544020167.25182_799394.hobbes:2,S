I thought I had checked this but...the problem goes away with "nolapic" (i
had configured lapic into previous kernels, even though a uniprocessor,
because it solved minor IRQ issues). Broken HP APIC? I fixed the IRQ issue
by forcing IRQ balancing. Interesting that this starts with 2.6.27.x.
Many thanks for your response.
