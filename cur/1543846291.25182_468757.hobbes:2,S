heh.
It's presumably too large a lump for vger to swallow so I put a copy at
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/irq-maintain-regs-pointer-globally-rather-than-passing-to-irq-handlers.patch
I disagree with the implementation of get_irq_regs() and set_irq_regs():
+DECLARE_PER_CPU(struct pt_regs *, __irq_regs);
+
+static inline struct pt_regs *get_irq_regs(void)
+{
+	struct pt_regs *regs = get_cpu_var(__irq_regs);
+	put_cpu_var(__irq_regs);
+	return regs;
+}
+
+#define irq_regs (get_irq_regs())
+
+static inline struct pt_regs *set_irq_regs(struct pt_regs *new_regs)
+{
+	struct pt_regs *old_regs, **pp_regs = &get_cpu_var(__irq_regs);
+
+	old_regs = *pp_regs;
+	*pp_regs = new_regs;
+	put_cpu_var(__irq_regs);
+	return old_regs;
+}
These should just use __get_cpu_var().  If someone calls these from
preemptible code, they're already buggy, because they now have a pointer to
possibly-another-cpus registers.  Using get_cpu_var() simply covers that
bug up.
And could we please remove the irq_regs macro?  It's only used in three
places so simply open-coding that is simpler.
Patches #1 and #2 don't come vaguely close to applying on top of all the
IRQ changes we still have queued for 2.6.19 so that will need redoing
please.  I'd expect to have that lot sent Linuswards around 48 hours from
now.
I think the change is good.  But I don't want to maintain this whopper
out-of-tree for two months!  If we want to do this, we should just smash it
in and grit our teeth.  But I am a bit concerned about the non-x86
architectures.  I assume they'll continue to compile-and-work?
What does Ingo think?
