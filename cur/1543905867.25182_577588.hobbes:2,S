Hi there,
i'm having troubles getting my mouse and/or touchpad to work with 
2.6.21.5 (and older ones). It's putting the following line into dmesg 
everytime the laptop gets lots of I/O or cpu load.
"psmouse.c: Wheel Mouse at isa0060/serio4/input0 lost synchronization, 
throwing 2 bytes away."
This happens for the touchpad and a newly brought PS/2 mouse. The cursor 
(be it gpm or X11) acts weird as in jumping around and clicking around 
without doing anything to it. As i searched about the string on google i 
found various tipps by removing ACPI (or even PM) from the kernel and retry.
I've tried following setups:
  No Power Management
  ACPI
  APM
  other clocksources (pit, tsc, acpi_pm)
The problem still exists and seems to occur as i've mentioned on lots of 
disk i/o and/or cpu load.
This is a laptop which is not supported by the manufactur anymore (seems 
to be a Gericom Webboy). I would appreciate any tips to debug this further.
Please post back for any additional information you need.
Thanks in advance.
