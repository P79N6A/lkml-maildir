This is obviously correct.
It happens that we execute gcc several times for just about any target
due to the:
CFLAGS += $(call cc-option, xxx)
And refactoring the top-level Makefile to avoid this is on my TODO list.
But it is a major crunch to do correct...
The primary objective to do so is btw not to solve this issue but
more to get the top-level Makefile off the top-10 list of the most
ureadable unmaitaninable unhackable code in the kernel.
