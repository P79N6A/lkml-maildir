Hello all,
today I ran into a problem with the TX/RX-counters of my tulip network cards. I
run the box under 2.2.19 with tulip.c:v0.91g-ppc 7/16/99
becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov, but this may be of common interest. Plain and
simple my TX counter reached 2G and the network connection just broke down. I
don't exactly know why, but this is obviously a bug. There are two solutions
possible for this:
1) wrap around the counter and restart them at zero.
2) enlarge the counter from (possibly) int or 32-bit to at least 64 bit.
I favor 2) very much, because wrap-around has a real m*d*s flair ;-)
Is this network-card specific? Is this fixed in 2.4 or later?
Regards,
Stephan
