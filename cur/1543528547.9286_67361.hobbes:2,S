It's nice to be clean. But it's not right to push it up to an obsession :((
Does anybody care to fix sdla drivers? As I understand it was an imperative
to remove two members from wandrivers structs... We did spare 6 bytes per
each sdla card. It's very huge economy. It's even bigger than that, 'coz
wanpipe does not compile any more and we can spare not only that 6 bytes,
but all the memory which wanpipe driver used to occupy :((
