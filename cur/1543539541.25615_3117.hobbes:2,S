You can issue commands to the controller but I will not disclose the

And if you REDLINE YOUR car for an HOUR and the engine blows is that bad
hardware??  Did I forget that you removed the rev-eliminator??
May caused by an abussive DRIVER......in both case.
The ATA-DRIVER can be used to abuse hardware.
