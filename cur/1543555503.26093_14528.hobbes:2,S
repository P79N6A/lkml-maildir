As you know, I'm making heavy use of uml for mm, vfs and fs development,
and I can't say enough good things about it.  With uml I have a
development cycle that looks roughly like this:
  20 secs make+gcc+ln
  10 secs boot new user mode linux
  6 secs fsck (if crashed before) :-)
  *tests go here*
  10 secs shutdown
And there are still a lot of ways to tighten that up.  The stability has
been impressive - so far, no crashes at all that weren't supposed to be
crashes, at least in the work I'm doing.
I think this is ready...
