Subject: [minor patch] exit_files()/exit_mm() -> NULL vs &init_xx

In exit_files() we are taking a different approch than in exit_mm().
I think it's desiderable to have an always valid current->files. There are
cases where we may want to browse all file descriptors opened by every
task in the system.
Currently the only piece of code that may cause a current->files to become
NULL are two kernel threads: lockd and rcpiod. They are using exit_files()
to close all file descriptors. So I think we could change exit_files() to
do this:

This way we'll be sure to have an always vaild current->files for all
tasks.
We could take a different path: we could avoid all special cases in
__exit_files() and do by hand in the kernel-daemon initialization code:
	exit_files(current);
	current->files = init_task.files;
	atomic_inc(&current->files->count);
(as kmod does for current->fs), instead of the only:
	exit_files(current);
I taken the approch in the patch because I see it a bit more clean and in
order to follow what exit_mm() is doing just now. I am supposing such
additional check won't be a performance issue.
Comments?
