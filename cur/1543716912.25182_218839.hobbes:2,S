Nick,
You're right. fdatasync suppose to be solution in this case and actually
test supports this mode as well as MySQL does :)
On other hand if you rather use O_DSYNC it does not seems to work being
mapped to O_SYNC. 
But the thing I'm mostly interested in is O_DIRECT. It seems to be the
best solution for many database needs, especially used together with
asynchronous IO. There is however no matching option which should not
flush MetaData.
