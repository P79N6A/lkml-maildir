Stephen took Bill's patches and fixed the bugs in them. Everyone running
-ac trees for a while has been using Stephens patch. I'm about to go line
by line through the tree differences to sort stuff into 
o	Neat, but not Linus tree (quite a few of those)
o	For Linus 
o	Oops where did that come from (quite a few of those too so far)
o	Possibly stale (bounce back via submitters to check)
Certainly feels close, and I do have a pile of stuff in my tree thats not
exactly urgent 2.2 material (SMP optimised 3c501 :))
