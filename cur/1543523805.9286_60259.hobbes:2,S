>Well then I suggest fixing it instead ;-)
Yep ;) I'm discussing with Paul about this issue. My current
understanding is that the few cases where sync is actually needed are
arch-specific anyway (TLB management, spinlock implementation, ...) and
so doesn't require this generic macro, but I want to be sure first.

Using lwbrx/stwbrx allow to have separate registers for the base address
and the offset of the register. That means that a smart compiler can put
the base address in a register once and keep it for all the subsequent
accesses. But that's probably not relevant in real-life performances when
doing a register access in a driver. (It's more interesting when using
those functions to byte-swap a bunch of stuffs in memory, but that's a
different matter).

This problem is true, regardless of the position of eieio. It's even a
non-platform specific problem since PCI write posting will cause this to
happen, regardless of the CPU ordering or eieio's.
If you need to have a known state and make sure the register was actually
written to the card, you need to do a read after the write from the same
address if possible (or from an other address on the same bus path).
Since this read will have it's eieio, things will then be completely
safe. This typically happens when dealing with on-board interrupt
masking/unmasking registers, when you want to make sure the interrupt is
actually masked before proceeding. (In this specific case of interrupt
management, you may also need an isync, but that's yet-another problem. I
beleive we lack a cross-platform macro for instruction-barrier, but I
still need to think more about this).

Yep. Or you can eventually use normal memory accesses like it's done
usually when accessing the fb. datas for the cursor pixels. In any case,
you need wmb() macro between filling the cursor datas and enabling it,
and this is not ppc-specific.

I need to think more about this (and discuss with some people having more
knowledge thatn I do) before giving you a definitive answer on this. I
just noticed that they were defined as sync.

In this case, the compiler can't help since the readl/writel macro don't
use the index argument of the lwbrx/stwbrx instructions at all. But you
are probably right about the irrelevance of such an optimisation in the
driver. It may help keeing the code a bit smaller, which is always a good
thing IMHO, but I agree we could stick with readl/writel for now.
