The whole patch set applies w/ no problems.
The kernel build process works without errors. The process is:
#!/bin/sh
#
ver=2.2.13
subver=ac1
#
cd /usr/src
rm -R /usr/src/linux-${ver}${subver}
rm linux
bzcat linux-${ver}.tar.bz2 |tar xvf -
mv linux linux-${ver}${subver}
ln -s linux-${ver}${subver} linux
bunzip2 patch-${ver}${subver}.bz2
cd /usr/src/linux
patch -p1 < ../patch-${ver}${subver}
make mrproper
cp ../linux-2.2.13pre17/.config ./.config
make oldconfig
  (at this point, I said No to all of the new config options which were 
   different from 2.2.13pre17)
make dep 
make clean 
make bzImage 
make modules
make modules_install
***********
No errors in this entore process, but when I do this:
# put the kernel in the /boot partition/directory.
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-${ver}${subver}
cp /usr/src/linux/System.map /boot/System.map-${ver}${subver}
The file bzImage is not there! The file System.map is not there!
All of the modules were built, and installed where they belong, but no kernel
and no map !
What went wrong?  Or better yet where do I start looking for what went wrong?
This same script was used to build all of the 2.2.13pre# series w/ no trouble
at all, so I'm baffled.
