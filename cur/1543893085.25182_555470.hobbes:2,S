Why should that matter?  All of the above.  Any piece of code can of
course choose to not be safe but it should have the opportunity to be,
too.  Currently that's not the case.  With an O_NONSEQFD flag to open it
would be trivial to change any code.  Or one can introduce a new set of
userlevel interfaces to create and write new files which then can do
even more.
In whatever way you look at it, there currently is a problem which
cannot be solved except with truly horrible, horrible hack (open N
descriptors and randomly select one to use; yep, horrible, I said so).
