Hello group,
The following USB Mass Storage device is found during bootup:
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB
Mass Storage devices
  Vendor: SOYO      Model: USB Storage-SMC   Rev: 0214
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
Is it a CompactFlash reader that plugs directly into a USB1 header on my 
motherboard.
/sys/bus/scsi/devices/0:0:0:0/* contains information regarding the device, 
however there is nothing /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0 for me to mount, 
regardless of whether there is a card in the drive or not.  I have hotplug 
enables, and inserting a card in the drive does not generate any new 
messages under dmesg (although verbosity stuff is not enabled).  Is this 
device not yet supported, or am I missing something that I need to enable?
Thanks,
Jim
