I sent the "possible config problem" list mostly
as a warning about what can cause kernels to lock up
early in the boot cycle.  Some of the problems I ]
mentioned will cause a lock up immediately after
the "Uncompressing kernel... OK Booting Linux" message.
I doubt that these problems are causing your problem
and so I really doubt that these crashes are occuring
in the same function that yours is.
Mostly, I thought you might want to double-check your
configuration options and make sure that you are using
none of these broken configuration combinations.
Good luck!  I wish I could be of more help.
