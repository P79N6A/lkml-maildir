Problem is that it could translate to a long aggregate delay
e.g. when the kernel tries to dump the backlog after console_init.
That is why I made the delay so short.
Longer delay would be possible, but then it would need some logic
to detect down links and don't delay on them and then retry later etc. 
Would be all far more complicated.
