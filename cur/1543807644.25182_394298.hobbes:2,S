XFS already has inheritable inode attributes, and they work in a
different (conflicting) manner. Currently when you set certain
attributes on a directory inode, then all directories and files
created within the directory inherit a certain attribute(s) at create
time. See xfsctl(3).
Having no flag set means to use the filesystem default, not "use
the parent config". Flags are also kept on the inode, not the
dentries. We should make sure that the interfaces do
not conflict.

Easy to add to XFS and to propagate back to the linux inode if
you use the current semantics that XFS supports. How the
memory allocator works from there is up to you...
Cheers,
Dave.
