  Hi, all. I've just grabbed 2.3.30-pre4 (and -pre5 and -pre3) and got
the following rude shock:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/kernel/v2.3/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer  -D__SMP__ -pipe -fno-strength-reduce  -DCPU=586    -c -o time.o time.c
time.c: In function `do_gettimeofday':
time.c:262: fixed or forbidden register was spilled.
This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
statements or clauses.
cpp: output pipe has been closed
make[1]: *** [time.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/kernel/v2.3/linux-2.3.30-pre5+devfs/arch/i386/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
Relevant config section appended. I'm using gcc 2.7.2.f.1 (I've been
using this compiler for years). The problem appears in pre3 through
pre5. I didn't check earlier pre-patches. 2.3.28 doesn't have this
problem.
