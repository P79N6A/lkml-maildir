The file include/sound/yss225.h is unused.
It is more or less identical to sound/oss/yss225.h,
used by sound/oss/wavfront.c.
# rm include/sound/yss225.h

(Maybe this file is a remains from an attempt to consolidate
sound/oss/yss225.c and sound/isa/wavefront/wavefront_fx.c -
it is true that that code duplication should be eliminated,
but the identifiers used ("page_zero" etc.) are unsuitable
as globals anyway.)
