Mutually exclusive goals for the most part....

This sounds reasonable for most features, except that some of the
newer features would not get exercised.  However, since newbies and 
commercial users usually use the "stable" series, this would
be a safe approach.
As Linux gets more attention by commercial entities, the press,
Wall street, etc., there is more visibility, hence more
pressure to have a VERY stable product.  Remember, whether we like
it or not we are in competition with Microsoft and hence a 
target for them -- including FUD, millions of $ of it.

Maybe goals like:
1.  all features in by 2.2.20
2.  bug fixes until about 2.2.25 or 30 then declare a "beta kernel"
    and ask for extensive testing
3.  user testing/bug fixes for 2 months or so
4.  release the production kernel after extensive user testing
Also, how about a kernel-kit for beta testers, including:
- file system check software (like someone on the list asked for)
- memory test software
- network test software
- required upgrades (e.g., for NFS)
[yes I know, many of these exist, but why not put them in a package?]
This plus a beta kernel could be used to exercise it prior to its
relase....  The more testers the better.

2.2 has been out for what, nearly 9 months and some of us (myself
included) are having stability problems with it....
My 2 cents -- flames >/dev/null
