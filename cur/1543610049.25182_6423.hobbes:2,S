That's because the HP is returning a READDIR reply that is larger than
the buffer size we specified. When this happens, we truncate the reply
at the last valid record before the buffer overflow, and print out the
above message.

No idea. That depends on where the problem lies...
Do you have a tcpdump for me? Preferably one from the client and one
from the server (showing the same period of time).
