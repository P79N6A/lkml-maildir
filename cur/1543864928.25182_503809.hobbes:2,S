http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net
 has almost everything you could possibly need.
Only gotcha I know of:  Sometimes one of the ipw3945d kernel threads will
hang in a loop if the RFKill switch is set to "kill" when the system comes
up.  I also don't know how it handles suspend, I don't use that on my D820.
I also needed to make 2 patches (attached) to make it work under recent -mm kernels,
with them I'm able to use it on 20-rc6-mm3.
Oh - the git-crypto-fix patch has to be applied with -R, I never got around to
re-diffing it the other way.
(Yes, I really should fix up these 2 and push them upstream to the ipw3945 crew.
That's on this week's to-do list...)
