Are you sure???
 From 
http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Environment
: Variables in make can come from the environment in which make
: is run. Every environment variable that make sees when it starts
: up is transformed into a make variable with the same name and
: value.
and most important:
: Thus, by setting the variable CFLAGS in your environment, you
: can cause all C compilations in most makefiles to use the
: compiler switches you prefer. This is safe for variables with
: standard or conventional meanings because you know that no
: makefile will use them for other things. (Note this is not
: totally reliable; some makefiles set CFLAGS explicitly and
: therefore are not affected by the value in the environment.)
