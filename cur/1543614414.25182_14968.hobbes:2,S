Frank,
could you open your vmlinux file with gdb, and figure out where the 2
stext_lock references lead to?
stext_lock+1c82 just means that it spins trying to acquire a spinlock,
but which one?
IIRC
gdb vmlinux
    $x/30i 0xc03fe0a0
    $x/30i 0xc0403050
should be enough.

Probably this cpu is spinning in get_chrfops(), trying to acquire the big kernel
lock.

I think the call chain is
system_call
-> calls sys_ioctl.
    acquires the big kernel lock.
    puts ppp_ioctl on the stack (+0: it's a function pointer, not a return value.)
-> calls ppp_ioctl
    and that one locks up.
The references to close/iput/delete_inode are just stale stack values from a previous
syscall.
Please check where stext_lock+6c30 leads: I think the deadlock is somewhere within
ppp_ioctl, and then the system locks up because the big kernel lock is blocked.
