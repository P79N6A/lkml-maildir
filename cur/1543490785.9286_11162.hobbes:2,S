Very likely, I routinely run at about 20M into my 100M swapspace, having used
up most of my 64M or RAM. There's normally about 1.5M of RAM free when the
machine is idle (which it almost certainly was - the machine runs updatedb off
cron's daily list at 04:02 in the morning).
As for reproducibility - well I'll have to try running some finds on /nt or
maybe try wine a few times (that seems good at showing up NTFS bugs).
