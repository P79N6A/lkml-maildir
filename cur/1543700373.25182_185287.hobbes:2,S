looks good. The indirect pointer nicely gets rid of complexity. I've
done some additional cleanups: fixed a compilation warning on UP and
cleaned up the goto pick_next_task code. Moved the 'unlikely' to the
test as a whole. I've test-booted this patch and the context-switch
stats look OK. Updated patch attached.
