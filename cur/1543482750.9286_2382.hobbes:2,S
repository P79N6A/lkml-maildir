Actually, all of this (including the special case of not needing
ioremap() for the legacy ISA area) _is_ documented.
See
	linux/Documentation/IO-mapping.txt
which has all this explained (and expressly _does_ mention that you
should _never_ care about physical addresses in any normal case). 
So this time we can't blame the documentation: this is one of the few
things I _did_ sit down and write documentation for (it's probably just
about the only file in the Documentation subdirectory that is actually
written by me).
