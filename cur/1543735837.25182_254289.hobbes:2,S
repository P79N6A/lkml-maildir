Figured it out.  It was user error.  I had an outdated patch.
Sorry for the noise.  Next time I'll check my patches more carefully.

p.s. For what it's worth, I only need to apply five patches to
vanilla 2.6.8 to get past various build errors:
      60     258    2483 kaz-types.patch
      50     207    2088 linux-2.6.8-arm-nonofpu.patch
     683    2328   27265 linux-2.6.8-build_on_case_insensitive_fs-1.patch
     285    1215   10145 linux-2.6.8-m68k-kludge.patch
      28     122    1028 linux-2.6.8-noshared-kconfig.patch
The build_on_case_insensitive_fs patch is the one that was out of date.
