Then, the new sysadm turns overcommiting on, and suddenly you realize
that you can support 300 simultaneous connections, with REAL full saturation
of each server, with no failure. 100% agreed.
Either the system is under control, or it's not. A perfectly tuned system
never goes OOM or OOS. A badly configured system misperforms no matter of
overcommitting being on or off.
