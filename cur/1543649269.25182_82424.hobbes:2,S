Subject: 2.4.18-14smp sys_call_table not found by the LKM loader

Hi, Friends:
I use linux kernel 2.4.18-14smp. I am trying a kernel module with a reference to
sys_call_table as:
extern void *sys_call_table[];
However, when loading the module into the kernel, the loader reports:
unresolved symbol sys_call_table
I read the following and related messages. My question is:
Is it true that I can NOT reference sys_call_table[] from a kernel loadable
module in 2.4.18-14smp or higher version kernels? Then if I need to intercept
system calls, how should I do it?
Thanks a lot for answers.
Hai

I am really not an expert on kernel-programming but I remember that
there was a security-hole in the ptrace-code with which one a local user
could gain root access. And there was a little kernel-modul with a
wrapper-function for the ptrace-syscall that made traces only possible
if the user who was calling this syscall was root. So if I understand
right if we don't export the syscall-table it is impossible to write
such syscall-wrapper-functions and it requires to recompile the kernel
and reboot the machiene to fix such an security-hole.
So wouldn't it be better to export the syscall-table and just write into
the documentation that it is not a good idea to manipulate syscalls or
write a compiler-makro that gives out a warning when such a module is
beeing compiled.
