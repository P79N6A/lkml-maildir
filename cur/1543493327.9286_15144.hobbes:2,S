That is my list of wild ideas. You might notice that the more sane and
standard security features are _not_ on that list. Capability bits,
ACLs, and Mandatory Access Control are not on that list.

Yes, /etc/passwd is just another file. It can be protected by normal access
control, even when an admin tries "echo r::0:0:r:/:/bin/sh >> /etc/passwd".

Yes. For an admin, the fI bits are that marking.

I think you object to the presence of multiple bits on the file granting
the same power to different users. The system is somewhat ugly.
If bloat were no concern, one could have a different set of bits
for each user on the system. Trying to cut the bloat a bit, one could
have a different set of bits for each group (assuming fewer groups
than users) or role. The draft cuts the bloat greatly, since it
calculates a per-user set of bits from pI, fI, and fP.

Some people here seem very concerned that a "standard" is being "broken".
Never mind the fact that we are dealing with a withdrawn draft proposal!
Well, I'd like to keep those people happy anyway. I think that there must
be a set of config values that provides the draft behavior.

Huh? You added pI and fI where they do not belong.

No, it must _not_ be constrained in that way. That would be absurd.

In case a buffer overflow is found, only an admin can fully exploit it.
Hopefully the threat of job loss will help the admin resist temptation.

In other words, your system makes them useless. They don't work.
You might as well just get rid of fI in that case.

In that case, let's just assume everything is setuid (for real). That is
essentially what you propose. All executables have full power, and they
enforce policies by themselves. I do not think this is safe.
You have to assume that apps are somewhat buggy. Admins are at least
partially trusted, but not 100% trusted. Buffer overflows that normal
users can exploit are worse than ones that only admins can exploit.
If admins were 100% trusted, you could forget about all this screwing
around and just give them all the root password on a normal system.

Nope, that is what I intended. If pI does not increase, the programs
that are run from a privileged app may crash.
You want to go with a weak system, then enhance it as needed.
I want to go full-strength POSIX draft, then weaken it as needed.
When fE_control_config is 0000000... you get full-strength draft.

"you may wish to" --> "the security admin may optionally"
This is full compatibility mode. You can have a powerful shell by
just running a shell. The bits that an unmarked executable gets
are part of what determines whether you get traditional UNIX or
a highly secure system. With 20% of the bits set, you get mid-level
security.

What is pI for then? Normally, pI is used for that purpose.

fP is not sufficient
I may want to give the "skill" (super kill) program CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
for use by everyone and CAP_KILL for use by admins only. By having
two separate enablers, I reduce the risk that I have to accept.

No, pP generally contains nothing at all. Power comes from pI.

I see "always added" as an adjustable compatibility feature.

That really isn't very different from my less-variable choice.

I don't see much of a varible explosion, but...
Yes, this type of system is complex. Capability lists, ACLs, MAC,
and other related features are all junk. True capabilities are the
only complete solution... but then the whole world breaks.
(that idea was: kill the whole filesystem concept and just pass
around persistent object handles)
