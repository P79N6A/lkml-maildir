Subject: Possible network buffer allocation bug?

When I press SHIFT-SCROLL-LOCK several times one after another,
I get "Total network buffer allocations" constantly increasing.
I am on a LAN, and online via modem.  No traffic occuring.  I
switched to single user mode, and killed networking (brought
interfaces down), then brought them back up.  The only other
machine on my LAN is SILENT right now (not plugged into the LAN),
so there is NO WAY any network traffic is going on period.
If I keep pressing SHIFT-SCROLL I get a steadily increasing
number for the above.
Also, the following:
Buffer hashed:   -17105
This number decreases constantly with each press of SHIFT-scroll.
I dunno what it means, but it seems fishy to me with nothing
running in userland...
Stock 2.2.13 kernel.
