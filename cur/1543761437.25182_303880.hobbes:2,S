We decided to implement PCI Express error handling based on the PCI
Express specification in a platform independent manner.  This allows any
platform that implements PCI Express AER per the PCI SIG specification
can take advantage of the advanced features, much like SHPC hot-plug or
PCI Express hot-plug implementations.

For PCI Express the endpoint device driver can take recovery action on
its own, depending on the nature of the error so long as it does not
affect the upstream device.  This can include endpoint device resets.
We expect the driver to do this upon error notification, if possible.
In PCI Express since the driver will have the most knowledge regarding
the error it will have the best ability to do device dependent recovery
and IO retry.  If its recovery fails then the AER driver will ask the
upstream device driver to perform the link reset.  Since this is more of
a side effect an explicit call to recover is not necessary.  However, we
understand and agree that it is needed to support the general error
recovery cases for PCI.
To support the AER driver calling an upstream device to initiate a reset
of the link we need a specific callback since the driver doing the reset
is not the driver who got the error.  In the case of general PCI this
could be useful if a PCI bus driver were available to support the
callback for a bridge device.  This would also support specific error
recovery calls to reset an endpoint adapter.  We need a call to request
a driver to perform a reset on a link or device.  
Thanks,
