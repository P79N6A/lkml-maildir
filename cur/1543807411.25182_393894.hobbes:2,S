what type of objects need to be spread (currently)? It seems that your 
current focus is on filesystem related objects: pagecache, inodes, 
dentries - correct? Is there anything else that needs to be spread? In 
particular, does any userspace mapped memory need to be spread - or is 
it handled with other mechanisms?
