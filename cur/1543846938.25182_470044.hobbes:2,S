A quick survey of the wreckage:
- Dmitry's input git tree breaks a bit
- five of Greg's USB patches need fixing
- a few random -mm patches need touchups
- The hrtimer+dynticks i386 patch takes rather a hit and will need redoing.
So, not too bad at all.  It's a bit rough on the poor old arch maintainers,
but it's pretty simple stuff.
I'd say let's do it...
