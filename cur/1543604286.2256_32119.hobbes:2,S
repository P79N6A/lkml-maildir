Fine, btw I also recall to have read something on those lines, and not
even in the 21264 manual but in the alpha reference manual that would
apply to all the chips but I didn't find it with a short lookup. Thanks
for checking!

Yes, it sounds strange. However According to Paul this would not be the
cpu but a cache coherency issue. rmb() would enforce the cache coherency
etc... so maybe the issue is related to old SMP motherboard etc... not
even to the cpus ... dunno. But as said it sounded very strange that
also new chips and new boards have such a weird reodering trouble.
