Mmm.. Ben had 2 comments last year:
In regards to the ethtool stuff i coded:
> This part is good, although doing something for copper cards needs doing, 
I know very little about hardware and only own the fiber version of this 
card. Even if i tried to make code for the copper version, it would 
probably blow it up the phy and set the switches on fire ;).
And in regards to the '"disable_autoneg" module argument':

This is pretty much Russian to me. 
I wouldnt know where to find the "link-autonegotiation-state-machine-for-fibre-cards" or know what to do with it anyway :).
The "disable_autoneg" is a convenient feature (for me and the other guy who made the same patch last year) and i consider it a harmless feature in every way.
It is simply an 'if'-statement, that skips the "start autoneg" function upon load.
We can simply remove the feature entirely if it is deemed undesirable.
So in conclusion:
- I vote "use the patch as-is", but im fine with it being changed. 
- If it needs support for copper, someone else has to code it.
