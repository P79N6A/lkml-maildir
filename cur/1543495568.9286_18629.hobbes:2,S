  Hi! I have upgraded my nfs file server today to 2.2.7 kernel, and used
the chance to install knfsd-1.3. While playing with a SGI with Irix 6.2
(ONC3 nfs and latest patches) with home directories mounted from the
server, i got the following messages on the console and syslog of the
server:
fh_verify: andreas/catini.log permission failure acc=2, error=13
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,17)): ext2_read_inode: bad inode number: 0
lookup_by_inode: ino 0 not found in .dt
find_fh_dentry: 08:11/0 dir/15974408 not found!
   catini.log is the log file from Catia software, and it seems to be
due to locking. .dt is the desktop configuration directory for Irix X, so
i believe it must be connected to it.
Any thoughts? Should we worry?
