The "CAP_SYS_MODULE" thing needs to change, I think.
We simply cannot allow user-space to do this AT ALL, even root by mistake.
Sure, root can do other damage, but we should never allow root to do
things that simply cannot make sense from an internal consistency
standpoint.
Suggested approach:
 - remove the CAP_SYS_MODULE etc checking altogether
 - make sys_clone() just always mask that bit off.
Ok?
