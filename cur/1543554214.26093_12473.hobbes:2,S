The only things sendmails < 8.10.x all suffer from is the crappy mapper
code. This causes all kinds of weard problems (logging not complete,
undelivered mail), especially if an external problem mucks around with the
mapper files (those .db things for example).
I had no problems with 8.11.x not talking to qmail or any other MTA.
