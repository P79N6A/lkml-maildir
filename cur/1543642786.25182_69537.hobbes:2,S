It could be that the cost is only present on the IBM whackomatics,
so they can twiddle the /proc setting and we can all be happy.
Certainly I did not see any problems on the quad.
Does "heuristic" overcommit handling need so much accuracy?
Perhaps we can push some of the cost over into mode 2 somehow.
Or we could turn it the other way up and, in __add_to_page_cache(),
do:
	if (overcommit_mode == anal)
		atomic_inc(&nr_pagecache_pages);
