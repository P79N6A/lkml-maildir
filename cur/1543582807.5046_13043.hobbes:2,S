No, he didn't, but I do read LKML. I've been searching around a little
(not much yet; I've been busy) for evidence of people using the
i840 with v2.0.xx, but have so far found none. I can't see any reason
why it shouldn't work, however.
The Gigabit 82543GC, on the other hand, is probably something that you'll
have to get a newer kernel to be able to use (unless Intel has released
a driver for it that they haven't submitted to me; the only Gigabit
driver in v2.0.39 is, if I remember correctly, yellowfin.)
