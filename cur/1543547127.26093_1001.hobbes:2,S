What does this have to do with private namespaces?
mailfsd /dev/coda0 --enable-imap &
mount /dev/coda0 /var/spool/mail
It looks easy to me, today and without private namespaces.
[Shall I hack podfuk into providing imap? Okay, it would not be easy
because 
* /var/spool/mail/xxx is _writable_, so your imap dream is probably
dream. What does your mailfs do when someone does cat /bin/bash >
$MYMAIL
* podfuk is has file granularity
I could see it working with some kind of directory format, however.]
