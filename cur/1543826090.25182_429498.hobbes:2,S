May be obvious from your usage point of view. It wasn't for what i was
thinking as resource management.
I thought there is some way the user can associate some amount of
resources (limits and guarantees) to a PAGG group and move the
corresponding tasks to that PAGG and that is all needed from user
space. 
In other words i thought there is some clever way to manage resources at
the PAGG level (without needing to tinker with the per task caps), which
wasn't obvious for me, and it is now clear that is not the case, and one
still have to keep tweaking the "per task" caps to get the result they
want.

Knobs that are available to the user are
 - per task nice values
 - per task cap limits and
 - per task statistics, if and when they become available.
user level application has to constantly monitor the stats of _all_ the
tasks and constantly keep changing the knobs if they want to keep the
"group of tasks" within their guarantees and limits. As others pointed
already, this may still _not_ yield what one wants, if you have tasks
with disparate need for a resource.
I certainly do not see it as the result of a simple marriage between
PAGG and "per task caps".
