Agreed, but I think we have some confusion here.
I was talking about interactions between kernel space and userspace after 
we started using the userspace interface. In particular, I was thinking of 
the fact that the netlink message number kept changing due to changes in 
the vanilla kernel. In the end, we just made it a command line option to 
the userui.
My point for this conversation was different, though. If uswsusp ever does 
fly, there are going to be flag days where users are going to have to 
download new userspace code, perhaps new versions of libraries or new 
libraries, run the compilation and reconfigure their initrds/ram-fses, all 
just because they upgraded their kernel and want to continue to suspend to 
disk. That is extra complexity introduced by using a userspace 'brain' 
instead of having it in kernelspace.
Regards,
Nigel
