Indeed. The whole concept is fatally flawed; probably the biggest
challenge facing a cracker attacking this system is choosing which of the
many avenues to start with :-)
1. The drivers. I really like displaying audio and video via my hard
drive, so I use drivers which do that...
2. Debugger: I'll stick a breakpoint in a suitable point, so just after
decryption the program is frozen and dumped to disk. Ooh look -
unencrypted content!
3. Rebuild the Windows kernel with the functions they rely on disabled.
When the kernel's out to get you, you're thoroughly screwed.
4. Run it under VMWare, and snapshot the screen with the content
displayed.
5. Don't buy this "protected" content crap, and watch their share price
go round the S-bend.
6. Run it under Wine, with a few API tweaks.
I'm sure there are plenty of other approaches, but this is rather OT for
lkml...
