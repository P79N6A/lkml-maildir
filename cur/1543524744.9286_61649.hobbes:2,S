sure, though it probably won't be this week.  please cc any updates in
the meantime to me...

I already sent Linus a pending patch against 2.3.42 which converts
drivers/char, and drivers/net is already done.  Unless there are
problems, I hope that will appear after the LinuxWorld dust settles on
Linus' desk.  :)  drivers/block would be good, though step lightly as
some of the dependencies in there have teeth, IIRC.  :)  And there are a
ton of sub-directories inside the major driver directories which are
worth evaluating.
