Ok, I did some more experiments and it seems you are right. Then it seems
Linux miscalculates the MHz if I select Auto in the BIOS. (I need to use acpi
pm timer then, otherwise I get lost ticks with tsc.) It is *not* throtteling
which results in this, as I can still throttle down via acpi by hand and then
the laptop feels very sluggish (same if Linux reports 133 or 500MHz). So I
wonder a bit how this comes, but well...
Thanx anyway,
Prakash
