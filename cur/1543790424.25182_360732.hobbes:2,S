Are you trying to record from the onboard nforce sound device or the
Audigy?  Do you have the same problem with the other device?
Make sure ecasound isn't doing something stupid like writing to the disk
from the audio thread, setting the disk IO thread to SCHED_FIFO, passing
data between the audio capture and disk threads in a non RT safe manner,
etc.
Also why are you using an -mm kernel?  It's highly experimental.  Most
audio people use the -rt kernel.
