I had the identical thought - i.e., that this is a job for object aging and 
not lru, then I realized that a slight modification to lru can do the job, 
that is:
  - An access to any object on the page promotes the page to the hot end
    of the lru list.
  - When it's time to recover a page (or pages) scan from the cold end
    towards the hot end, and recover the first page(s) on which all
    objects are free.

My suggestion might.
