Please don't do it like this: I hate code that changes standard PCI data 
structure meaning (in this case the "class" thing) behind peoples back.. 
Some other user might well want to look at the original class member, and 
rewriting it to a magic value just to make the transparency check pass 
sounds like a bad idea to me.
So instead, I would suggest that you add a single-bit "transparent" field
to the PCI structure, and initialize it to "(class & 0xff) == 1" when
initializing the device data. Then, any fixup can just set the transparent
bit to 1.
That would make the code more robust, and more readable in my opionion.
Ok?
