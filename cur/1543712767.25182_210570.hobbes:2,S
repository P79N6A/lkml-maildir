I think we're mixing a few concepts together.  submit_bh(WRITE_BARRIER,
bh) gives us an ordered write in whatever form the lower layers can
provide.  It also ensures that if you happen to call wait_on_buffer()
for the barrier buffer, the wait won't return until the data is on
media.
The construct allows for the second type of commit you describe above,
where wait_on_buffer is not called on the log blocks until after the
commit block has been sent down the pipe.  The reiserfs barrier patch
does this now.
The fact that IDE implements the barriers via a flush and that no other
layer has barriers right now is secondary ;)  I do want to revive some
kind of ordering for scsi as well, but since IDE is a safety issue right
now I wanted to concentrate there first.

Yes, they are completely different.  blkdev_issue_flush is the kernel
recognizing that wait_on_buffer (or page or whatever) isn't always
enough to make sure writes are really done.  It has no ordering
semantics at all, it just means "really write what you've already told
me is written, unless you promise via battery backed cache that it will
get to disk eventually"
