Subject: [RFC][PATCH] mark /proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level to be removed

Since scsi_logging_level module_param can be read/written while system
running, the demand for /proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level has been no longer
mandotory.
But someone might have already set this value in /etc/sysctl.conf, so
mark it to be removed in one year (until March 2009).
One year might be not enough or too long, this period should also be discussed.

+When:	March 2009
+Files:	drivers/scsi/scsi_sysctl.c
+Check:	/etc/sysctl.conf
+Why:	its functionality is also provided by the scsi_mod's module param,
+	module_param(scsi_logging_level, int, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR);
+	that can be read and written with
+	/sys/module/scsi_mod/parameters/scsi_logging_level
+	like the sysctl interface while system running.
