That's the change.  Memory reserves on a per-zone level would now be used 
with respect to ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS because TIF_MEMDIE tasks no longer 
have an explicit bypass for them.  If the node is not in the task's 
mems_allowed and it's a __GFP_HARDWALL allocation or if it's neither
PF_EXITING or in the nearest_exclusive_ancestor() of that task's cpuset, 
then we move on to the next zone in get_page_from_freelist().
The problem the patch addresses is that, as you mentioned, tasks with 
TIF_MEMDIE have an explicit bypass over using any memory reserves and can 
thus, depending on zonelist ordering, allocate first on nodes outside its 
mems_allowed even in the case of an exclusive cpuset before exhausting its 
own memory.  That behavior is wrong.
