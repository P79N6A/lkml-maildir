I don't like this part of the fix:

because the linking process (gen-elf-pmac) really does depend on
ld.script.  Since gen-elf-pmac uses $<, not $^, it should be OK with
the ld.script in the dependencies.  Did you verify that there was a
problem with this rule or did you just rip out all of the ld.script
dependencies?
Similarly we need the ld.script dependency in here:
> -$(images)/zImage.chrp: $(CHRPOBJS) $(obj)/image.o $(LIBS) $(boot)/ld.script
> +$(images)/zImage.chrp: $(CHRPOBJS) $(obj)/image.o $(LIBS)

> -$(images)/zImage.initrd.chrp: $(CHRPOBJS) $(obj)/image.initrd.o $(LIBS) $(boot)/ld.script
> +$(images)/zImage.initrd.chrp: $(CHRPOBJS) $(obj)/image.initrd.o $(LIBS)
>  	$(call cmd,gen-chrp)
Here, gen-chrp does have a problem because it uses $^, but it looks to
me that with a minor change it could just use $< and avoid the
problem.
The other places where you have removed ld.script from the
dependencies look OK to me.
Regards,
Paul.
