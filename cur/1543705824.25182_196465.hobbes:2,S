Hm, that's a good question. :)
As I said I had these error messages on 2.6.2-rc2, but now
on 2.6.2 I don't have them anymore. (at least until yet).
But could also have something to do with the switch from
KDE-cvsHEAD-december2003 to KDE-3.2. I don't know.
I'm compiling software and accessing the disk heavily today
(and yesterday) but I can't see the message anymore.
That's strange!
