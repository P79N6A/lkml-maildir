I completely agree.  The only reason why people want the expr to be evaluated
in the no-debug case is that some broken kasserts might have side effects.
This argument is specious:  fix the asserts.  One way to make such
broken asserts a bit easier to find is to do something like
	#define kassert(cond) \
		if ((cond) && ((cond) == (cond))) {} else {burp}
It doesn't catch all cases, far from that, but has the advantage of only
slowing down the debug case.  There could be several kassert behaviors (even
changeable at run time):
- default:  just do the check and print any error
- no debug:  replace kassert with (void)0
- debug asserts:  use the multiple-eval trick above to increase the chances
  of catching buggy asserts.
and orthogonal to that, you could choose whether to oops/panic/donothing
in case of an actual failure.
