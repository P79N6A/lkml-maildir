Most of the time. Besides "rework" is not necessarily "rewrite from
scratch", most of the time it means "modification" of the existing
system.

Bad example -- just count number of lines in drivers/scsi/scsi*.c
and in Netscape 4.0 and you'll see why.
That does not mean I advocate throughing out current SCSI mid layer and
writing a new one. As I can tell, no one on that list is proposing the
"rewrite from scratch" approach.
  I just was trying to point out that Luben's transport "layers" in
place of transport "modules-appendages" simplifies that
migration/evolution.
