Well you could add a new flag to the file_system_type struct
("FS_INVISIBLE") that is set when this or that condition (like TMPFS=n)
is in effect. It would be just cosmetic though.
You can't mount a lot of other filesystems like the hidden bdev,
pipefs or sockfs (it would really be nice to explore them with ls!),
yet they are not invisible either right now.
