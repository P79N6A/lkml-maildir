At the interface level, there is some support.
Look at hdparm's -b option to tristate the bus.
But that's the whole bus.  If the controller implements
master/slave on one cable, you're hosed, electrically.
It's the whole interface.  95% of controlers are like this.
Intel's PIIX can do master/slave on separate ports, but
then you loose one bus.  Laptops with bays also do things
like this, but that's special hardware, hard to get programming
specs for.
I think if you add the drive *after* boot, it doesn't
have the benefit of the BIOS setting up PIO/UDMA modes,
so I would try the hdparm -X speed settings also.
