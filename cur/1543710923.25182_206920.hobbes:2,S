It should suspend at any load, but AFAICR those hooks are not for
that. They are neccessary for "crashed nfs server case", which kill
-SIGSTOP does not handle. (IMNSHO thats bug in -SIGSTOP and pretty
orthogonal to swsusp).

There's even more important goal. I'd call it
O. Do not impair system reliablity *when swsusp is not in use*.
   Do not make further development of system harder by putting too
   much hooks into other code.

I still do not believe 1. and 2. *require* that ugly hooks (as long as
your NFS server is up).
Now, what if NFS server is down? I'd not handle it for now; if your
harddrive stops working you can't suspend, too, and NFS is too similar
to disk.

For first merge, I'd like to have simplest possible version, that's no
compression, powerdown at the end, no escape.

Yes. People are working on that.
