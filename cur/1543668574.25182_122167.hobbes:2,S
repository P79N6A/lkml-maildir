Once we find a match in the pte entry, we have the additional protection of
the pte_chain lock.  The pte entry is never cleared without a call to
page_remove_rmap, which will block on the pte_chain lock.

I suppose PageAnon should be renamed to PageChain, to mean it's using
pte_chains.  It did mean anon pages until I used it for nonlinear pages.

Hmm... I was gonna say that page_remove_rmap will BUG() if it doesn't find
the entry, but it's only under DEBUG and could easily be changed.  Lemme
think on this one a bit.  I need to assure myself it's safe to go unlocked
in the middle.
