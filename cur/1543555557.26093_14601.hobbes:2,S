Hi!

Handheld machines never have any swap, and alwys have little RAM [trust me,
velo1 I'm writing this on is so tuned that 100KB les and machine is useless].
 Unless reservation  can be turned off, it is not acceptable. Okay, it can
be tuned. Ok, then.
[What about making default reserved space 10% of *swap* size?]
