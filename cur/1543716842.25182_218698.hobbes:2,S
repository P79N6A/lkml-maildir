I think this is wrong, and I thought the gcc people (well, rth seemed to
imply it was a no-brainer) already agreed to support "+m" since:
 - it has long been documented
 - it should be trivial to expand _internally_ in gcc if some 
   implementation thing makes gcc prefer the "=m" / "m" combination.
Richard? 
If it's just a warning in 3.4, and later gcc's are supposed to make it ok 
again, then..
