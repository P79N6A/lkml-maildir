Yep.
And about the other question?

But without keeping those pages pinned in the ptes, the nopage approch is
_suboptimal_ and adding a dummy swapout that returns "progress" where no
progress is been made will also _break_ the VM with relatively large device
mmapped vmas. It would at least _certainly_ break 2.2.18pre15aa1 (if 2.4.x has
an oom deadlock in GFP it won't break of course).
I'm fine to drop remap_page_range and the PG_reserved bit, but to do that I'd
suggest to add a new per-VMA VM_RESERVED bitflags. This will also avoid to walk
pagetables where it makes no sense to unmap the pages (it won't only avoid
senseless page faults) and it will fix the VM callbacks problem that returns
"success" when no progress is made. (SHM returns a dummy 0 too, but progress is
been made in that case)
The only reason it could make sense to do that unmapping is if we would be able
to also free the _pagetables_, but we do that only via munmap if a whole gdt
entry gets unmapped (and after munmap the page is been just unmapped anyways).
So once we'll free pagetables via swap_out (maybe never) some driver with
houndred of mbytes of virtual mapping may choose to drop the VM_RESERVED
bitflag from their vmas if pagefaults aren't a performance problem for that
drivers.
I just find hard to widespread propose something that ends doing the wrong
thing (ok I see it's not a big deal but it's still the _wrong_ thing to do and
the VM_RESERVED way will fix it a _zero_ cost, it will improve performance
compared to PG_reserved and it will also avoid the uglyness of having all the
SG drivers out there implementing a dummy swapout callback :).

Once VM_RESERVED is in place using nopage instead of remap_page_range looks
fine to me (we'll have an additional startup page fault but that can
explained as a mmap latency reduction and after all people can keep
using remap_page_range to avoid that first page fault as the bttv
driver would still do with the above patch applied even if it's just
using the new vma_reserve way).
(in theory we could use VM_LOCKED for that but as you noticed we would
end corrupting the number of locked-page stats and I just find cleaner
to not mix mlock and reserved kernel pages issues)
