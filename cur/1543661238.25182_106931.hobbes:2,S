BIOS revision matters too. With 1004 you need to set MP 1.1 not MP 1.4
and APIC works reliably. With 1007 it seems that isnt needed but people
report weird hangs. 1004 also won't POST with a broadcom ethernet card
in it.
The proper fix for the PS/2 mouse/IDE problem appears to be always
mapping out the page at 636-640K. Andi posted an ugly patch to handle
that, but doing it cleanly is trickier.
