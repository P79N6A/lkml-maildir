Hello!
BTW Andrea, could you look at line in net/socket.c, touching i_count?
I added a comment there recently:
		/*
		 * The socket maintains a reference to the inode, so we
		 * have to increment the count.
		 *
		 * It smells... In theory we should not make this not holding
		 * inode_lock. This syncronization point is not better than
		 * kernel lock. I see no problem now, this inode is our private
		 * property.
		 */
		sock->inode->i_count++;
I wrote "I see no problem", but it is true only if this inode is
really private i.e. VFS never changes i_count for some service purposes.
Also, is it difficult to make similar thing with d_alloc_root?
They are also dummy, so that it does not require cleaning all of dcache.
It would allow to shot the last kernel lock in net/...
