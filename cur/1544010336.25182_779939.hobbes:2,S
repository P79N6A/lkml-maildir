No. I haven't tested it. But very soon I'll try to test it.
Well, you said pending signal. What will happen when a pending signal
will send. In current code check is made to make sure that the task is
frozen or not. I mean , when a signal is send ( from theoritical POV,
which could be any ) this code doesn't make sure what will happen to
that perticular process.
It is already a infinite loop, the check is made to make sure that
whether the task will be scheduled or not.
Thanks,
