part 1 is correct. non __GFP_IO only shrinks the cache. This was mostly
a feature for some place that is calling GFP_ATOMIC by mistake, and they
shoud call GFP_NOIO, they don't want to slowdown too much, usually
they're in realtime context. However it should be safe to set
failed_swapout to zero always too.
part 2 is the thing that avoids the kernel to deadlock during oom, the
first time I scan the whole vm and nothing was freeable I stop trying
otherwise it takes way too long to handle oom gracefully.
I've another message from you in queue.
Feel free to ask for more details.
