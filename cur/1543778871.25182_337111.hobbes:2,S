Why is the alpha channel not given the same weight as the RGB? Wouldn't
it be correct to also give it 4 bytes (16 bits)  Also, what would happen if
you exceed 256 entries, you've only alloted a maximum of 256 for the
index?  This will also be a problem because you cannot access cmap entries
past 255.
So, 4 bytes per channel + 4 bytes for the index will be needed per entry,
Tony
