Yes, I just built a few machines with 2.2TB of disk apiece.  And this
isn't really all that esoteric; each box only cost around $7K.

Well, these are just file servers.  It would be a waste to stick a
64bit processor in there just for its 64bitness; if I could get
Hammers, I'd rather run compute jobs on them and leave the menial
tasks like file serving to the 32bit machines.

Well, I'd happily run a custom kernel on these machines.  I certainly
don't want my other hundred-plus machines to run slower just to let a
handful of file servers see all of their disk, but it would be nice to
have the choice.
