Thanks. I tried the latest BIOS for the board but that did not resolve the
problem. The clock still runs at double speed (2000 timer
interrupts/second instead of 1000) and I still get the APIC errors.
I'll enter a support request with the manufacturer.
I was able to get the problem to go away by using a BIOS option to
"disable APIC mode". When I do this the kernel outputs at boot:
	ACPI: Using PIC for interrupt routing
and the output of /proc/interrupts reads 'XT-PIC' for everything.
If anyone has a suggestion for debugging the clock problem in APIC mode
I'd be interested. I'm guessing that something is causing the timer
interrupt to be mapped twice- are there any tools for looking at the ACPI
tables that may help, or are there kernel boot options to give more detail
about how the interrupt routing is being set up?
Thanks,
Chris Wing
