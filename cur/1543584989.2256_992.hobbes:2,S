I have some questions on this.
1) If a process uses swap space and then later (after being paged
   into memory -- or even not) it completes, is killed, etc., is
   the swap space reclaimed then?
2) If a process uses swap, is paged into memory, and is then swapped
   out again, does it re-use the same swap as before?
If the answer to either question is no, then IMHO, that's a pretty
serious design flaw.
