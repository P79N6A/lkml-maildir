I thought the patch was OK with typos fixed.

I read the thread you mention about the IMR muckup along the way to creating
my nforce2 patches - it was most enlightening as to how bad consumer computers
can be.
Prakash tracked his overheat to a buggy binary nvidia driver
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108059111721363&w=2
and not Maciej's patch.
Thomas was tracking down C1 C2 etc states but I do not know the results of
his search?
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107972277920929&w=2
Was it a problem only with one machine?
I do not recollect any other threads indicating problems with the patch.
I remember rediffing my nforce2 io-apic patch using the 2.6.3-mm3 kernel with
Maciej's patch and having no heat trouble. I am surprised it got pulled out but
then I only tested it on one type of chipset.
BTW I just rebooted to my modified 2.6.3-mm3 and got my normal 38C cpu.
I have to have timer_ack=0 in my io-apic timer routing patch for nforce2 to
get nmi_debug=1 to work. This was all along the way to trying to stop lockups.
In fact I have been running no timer_ack kernel mods since December on 4 
machines and all have been cool and hard lockup free.
