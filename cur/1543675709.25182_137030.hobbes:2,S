Details, please. What does `cat /proc/cpuinfo` say?
My intention here is that we should be able to detect
this apparently broken "CPU" by its vendor/model and
clear cpu_has_apic for it.
Alternatively the no_apic label in detect_init_APIC()
could clear cpu_has_apic.

Hmm, obviously a 2.4 kernel.
Looks like a hang in setup_APIC_timer(). My guess is that
the do loops in that procedure don't work if clocks==0
or the local APIC timer registers are frozen.
