/sys/devices/....../cpuX/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
Gives you the information about last frequency that Linux tried to set
on this CPU 
/sys/devices/....../cpuX/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
(When supported) Gives you the information about actual frequency that
the CPU is running at. 
Zero frequency value below is certainly a bug in the driver. What is the
kernel you are using?
On the particular CPU you have here, all cores in a package indeed share
the frequency. But, it does not really show up in affected_cpus as OS is
not coordinating the shared-ness of P-state across cores. That means, OS
programs each core individually based on CPU utilization and hardware
will pick the highest frequency among the two and run both cores at that
frequency.
