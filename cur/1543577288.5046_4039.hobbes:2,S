I'm not sure the hit on spinlock is this heavy (one increment for lock
and one dec + test on unlock), but I completely agree (and volonteer)
for benchmarking. I'm not convinced a full preemptive kernel is something
interesting mainly due to the context switch cost (actually mmu contex switch).
Benchmarking is a good way to get a global overview on this.
What about only preemptable kernel threads ?

I may be tired but I believe you're focusing on SMP architecture ?
This code simply defer the preemption at the end of the spinlock/lock
section. I don't see how you can easily mix sleeping lock and this
mechanism.
