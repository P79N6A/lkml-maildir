Hi all,
    I have a program that automaticaly recreate a directory in /proc, 
based on some events. To do this, I do a remove_proc_entry, and then 
recreate the directory.
    However, if someone is using a console and is currently IN my /proc 
directory, remove_proc_entry fails, saying that the dir is "busy".
    Any way to force the deletion? Or any ideas for workarounds?
    Many thanks
       Jena-Guillaume
