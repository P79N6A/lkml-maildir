Fixes wrong, outdated path of vgacon.c
Hello we are Ioannis Barkas (risc4all@yahoo.com) and
Nikos Barkas (doubl3nuts@yahoo.com).
VGA-softcursor.txt points to vgacon.c at a wrong
directory so we fix it.
We sent the patch from diff -u as an attachment
because damn yahoo...can't even format an inline
patch!Many thanks to "Randy Dunlap"
<randy.dunlap@oracle.com> and sorry for the
inconvenience.
