My first patch is not so bad, I think.
Or, It may be better to revert the return type of oprofile_arch_init()
from "void" to "int"  to get the result of initialization.
Though I don't know when/why its interface was changed. and some
architectures (ppc, sh64, m32r) remain to have old interfaces in -mm.
