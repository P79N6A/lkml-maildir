It's been a while since I looked at this....  the fetchop driver maps
AMO space which is excluded from the EFI memory map (and any SHub
aliases) and thus shouldn't be touching anything normally considered
RAM.
<pause>
Checking the source I see:
    if (remap_page_range(vm_start, __pa(maddr), PAGE_SIZE, vma->vm_page_prot)) {
            fetchop_free_pages(vma->vm_private_data);
            vfree(vdata);
            fetchop_update_stats(-1, -pages);
            return -EAGAIN;
    }
as part of the drivers 'mmap fop'.  The underlying page is actually
from region-6 so I'm pretty sure it's safe.  If you think it is doing
something weird please let me know.
