No, its worse sadly -- think fcntl(fd,F_SETOWN,&pid) sort of thing.
We will need a new F_SETOWN or esle the SIGIO stuff will break.
Its likely there are other such cases too.

Oh, I completely agree -- but perhaps we wanted to divide that 64-bit
space into bit-regions which had some intrinsic meaning? It may sound
really gross, but you never know.
The main reason I mentioned this, was I imagine for most 64-bit
platforms, accessing a 64-bit word as opposed to a 32-bit word is as
cheap or cheaper and may allow various atomic operations.
