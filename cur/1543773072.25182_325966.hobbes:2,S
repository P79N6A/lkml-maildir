That is true.  UTF-8 wouldn't cause any more problems than ascii already
does, such as some filesystems not allowing : and * in filenames among
other characters.

Well at least that seems like they did something right when they
extended FAT with VFAT.  Doesn't make FAT a good filesystem, but it does
make the filename extension pretty nice, much as it is an ugly hack too.

The constant rewriting of the same sectors that store the FAT is really
bad for some types of flash and other removeably media (like DVD-RAM).
I hadn't noticed any big overhead in UDF, although packet writing may
add some overhead itself (I never used packet writing).
