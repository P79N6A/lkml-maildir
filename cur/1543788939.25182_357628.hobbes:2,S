i'm not sure latency traces will uncover anything useful for this bug.  
Your problems could be timer issues: timers going off too fast cause 
high keyboard repeat rates, and the same goes for the screensaver. Does 
'sleep 1' work as expected, or is that timing out in an "accelerated" 
way too?
one tweak would be to turn off SMP support in the .config for testing 
purposes. Another tweak would be to turn HIGH_RES_TIMERS on in the 
.config - it is the common operating mode and the default, so non-HRT 
timers could have attracted some bug we didnt notice yet.
