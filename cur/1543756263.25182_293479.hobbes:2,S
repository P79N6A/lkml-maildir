: Jan - can you give Jens a bit of an idea of what drivers and/or schedulers 
: you're using?
	I have a Tyan S2882 dual Opteron, network is on-board tg3,
there are 8 P-ATA HDDs hooked on 3ware 7506-8 controller (no HW RAID
there, but the drives are partitioned and partition grouped to form
software RAID-0, 1, 5, and 10 volumes - the main fileserving traffic
is on a RAID-5 volume, and /var is on RAID-10 volume.
	Filesystems are XFS for that RAID-5 volume, ext3 for the rest
of the system. I have compiled-in the following I/O schedulers (according
to my /var/log/dmesg :-)
io scheduler noop registered
io scheduler anticipatory registered
io scheduler deadline registered
io scheduler cfq registered
I have not changed the scheduler by hand, so I suppose the anticipatory
is the default.
	No X, just serial console. The server does FTP serving mostly
(ProFTPd with sendfile() compiled in), sending mail via qmail (cca
100-200k mails a day), and bits of other work (rsync, Apache, ...).
Fedora core 3 with all relevant updates.
	My fstab (physical devices only):
/dev/md0                /                       ext3    defaults        1 1
