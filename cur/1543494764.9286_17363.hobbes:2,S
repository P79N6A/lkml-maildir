Well, I know enough to tell if you're shittin' me -- I think. =)

OK... I'm just uncertain as to how much info is needed to track this stuff
down.  This is only my second oops -- the first one that I had was my
fault, because I put in a piece of nonworking hardware (RAM) and wanted to
see what would happen.
However, everything in my system is just fine.  RAM is okay, CPU is okay,
cards/hardware is OK.  All hardware has drivers either in the kernel or as
modules.
Anyway, since this is my first _real_ oops, I hope that I'm doing things
accordingly.. though, I don't know exactly how to contact whomever I'm
supposed to contact, Linus says in /usr/src/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt
that I should find who does that part of the kernel.  But, my question is,
how?  I can't debug for crap, unless you've got me working with BASIC.
Still learning what to do here...

I compile a lot of options that many people don't.  For example:
	HFS Filesystem
	Macintosh Parititon Support
	vesafb (*)
	others...
Many of the options that I compile in are things for other people as well,
like the vesafb.  It's basically a "generic" kernel... even my friends
with PII and PIII processors want to get their kernels from me, because
I've been compiling kernels for a long time now and am relitively familiar
with it.  Hell, I should tell them that if they want a kernel recompile,
they can take me to their house and I'll do it there -- it'd probably only
take a couple of minutes, and I could make two kernels... one special for
their system, and one special for mine.

Well, it's just a personal machine.  The only thing that prevents me from
booting is my ego... I want to get a good uptime ;)... The lowest uptime
I've seen is something like 40 days here in my area... The max I've ever
had was 10, and a new kernel came out.  Now I'm up to:
  5:11pm  up 6 days, 10:35,  4 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
Oh, well.  I'll reboot. =)

LOL!  I like the sig! =-)
