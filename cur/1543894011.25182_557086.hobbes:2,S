Sure, if they make any changes or fixes to Linux.  Other than that,
only the same benefit that Microsoft get from Windows piracy - TiVo
employees become familiar with Linux and are more likely to use it
and maybe contribute more in another job later.
What we don't get is TiVo having a better kernel than everyone else
because they've put some work into extending it without giving that
work back.
I see stuff in arch/powerpc/kernel/ which is Copyright "TiVo, Inc"
and more recent stuff in usb/net/asix.c and usb/net/mcs7830.c which
is more than I've ever contributed to the kernel, despite making
extensive use and even selling services where I ran servers with
Linux on them but didn't allow my customers to change the kernel
on the servers if there was some feature they wanted to play with.

Not particularly, no.  Other than maybe some nice features that TiVo
gains from being able to use Linux.
