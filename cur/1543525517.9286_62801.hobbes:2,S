Oleg (cc'd to net driver guys and Linus),
thanks for the patch.  The middle hunk, the one calling
dev_kfree_skb_irq, is already in 2.3.44-pre8.
Once I figure out this transmit timeout problem[1], I am planning on
submitting my 8139too driver to Linus, as my driver includes many fixes
which are not in the current rtl8139.c code in the Linus tree nor in
Becker's test code.  As CardBus support is now implemented, the only
thing lacking is RTL-8129 support.  Thus, I will probably do something
like this:
cd drivers/net
mv rtl8139.c rtl8129.c
vi Config.in Makefile   # new config option: CONFIG_RTL8129
cp $jeffhacks/8139too.c drivers/net
vi Config.in Makefile	# make CONFIG_RTL8139 point to my driver
More to the point, my 8139too driver uses the new kernel PCI and CardBus
interfaces, and currently has no problems which the Becker drivers do
not have :)
	Jeff
[1] transmit timeouts:
exist in kernel driver (1.07+hacks) and becker test driver (1.08[a-z])
does not exist in 8139too, pre-2.3.43
exists in 8139too, post-2.3.43
