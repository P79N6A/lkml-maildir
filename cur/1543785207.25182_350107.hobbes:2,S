A LUN is at the same concept level as a CDB.
You can see this by reading SAM or looking at the definition
of _any_ transport frame of _any_ transport (close your eyes and
pick one).
What you will see is that there is no "MSB" or "LSB" for
things like CDB and LUN fields.
SAM is very explicit on this, especially for LUN the language
used is very affirmative.

I've never seen the symbols "lun".  In any spec
"Logical Unit Number" and "LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER" have always
been abbreviated "LUN".
As to code, it is completely clear which is which.  If you take
a look at the SAS code you know immediately what 
"task->ssp_task.LUN" is.  It is what you'd see in a spec, in the
transport frame, the "LUN", "u8 LUN[8]" field.
After a while, this becomes second nature to you.
