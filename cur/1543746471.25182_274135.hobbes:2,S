 Hello!
 I'm a member of AROS team (
http://www.aros.org
) and i'd like to ask for a permission to use parts of Linux source code (small parts) in developing this system. It is licensed under APL (
http://www.aros.org/license.html
) so i need a permission. I don't know where to ask for it so i ask here.
 Currently i use a little part of ide-cd driver and its includes.
