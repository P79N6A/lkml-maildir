Well, in principle you can use the observation that the _FROZEN versions
are used during suspend/hibernation.  Thus, if you only unregister the device
for CPU_DEAD, but you won't do that for CPU_DEAD_FROZEN, it will work as long
as the freezer is there.

In fact, it's already done that way and I don't think it's racy (see above).
