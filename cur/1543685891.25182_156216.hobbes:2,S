Please, send just one patch per email, each one having its own changelog
info.  There's just no way anyone's patch import tools can handle a single

Does this mean that we have another gaggle of kernel threads for all the

It might be better to create a custom kernel thread on-demand, or kill off
the workqueue when its job has completed.
