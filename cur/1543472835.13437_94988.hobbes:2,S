Correct. That was recently changed as part of the GATT treaties. BTW,
the GATT treaties, if I am reading them right, allow you to enforce
your patents in any GATT signatory country. But consult a lawyer, not
me.
There is more info at 
http://www.law.cornell.edu
 (the Cornell
University Law Schools's online law library, great stuff!). They
have both "before" and "after" snapshots of the Patent law, because
the older law still applies to patents issued under said law.

Yes. See the snippet of the U.S. code that I referred to earlier.
