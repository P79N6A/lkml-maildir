Well if a NULL parameter is the exceptional case, then you don't want to
litter the L1 cache with the extra code that will only save a function
call in rare cases.
And I think it should be the exceptional case, because it shouldn't really
be used for much other than streamline error handling or cleanup functions
to cope with failed allocations without adding checks everywhere. If you're
doing lots of kfree(NULL) as part of normal operation, then that may
suggest you aren't tracking your memory very well.
