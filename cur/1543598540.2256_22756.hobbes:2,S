Hi
I just  compiled linux  2.4.9 on my  laptop. It has  got a  solo-1 based
sound card. I've tried to compile  the kernel with the static support of
the card  and, for  it is  a laptop and  it hasn't  got any  gameport, I
didn't selected any joystick support.
The   kernel   cannot   compile,   I've   got   a   linking   error   in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/soundcore.o  because  it  cannot  find  the
functions  gameport_register_port and  gameport_unregister_port  . If  I
compile the driver as a module it is compiled succesfully and it works.
I've looked at /usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/esssolo1.c and commented out
the two lines (2378 and 2423)  that call the 2 functions for registering
and unregistering  the gameport and  the driver compiles  statically and
works.
I know this  is just a little hack,  but I want to bring note  to you of
this problem that I have found even with earlier 2.4 kernels (I've tryed
2.4.5 , 2.4.6 and 2.4.8).
I hope this email could be useful otherwise please excuse me.
Bye
