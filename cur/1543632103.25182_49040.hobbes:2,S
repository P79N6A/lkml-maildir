Hi all,
I have a program which basically reads udp data (large amounts) from a
socket and writes it to a file. Whenever the network input rate increases
it cause the system to hang or my program is killed due to lack of memory.
I have 256MB RAM + 2 GB swap. Just before my system hangs( or my program
is killed), I have about 1 or 2 MB of physical memory and 1600 MB of swap
free. I don't understand why my program should be killed due to lack of
memory when I have so much of free mem.
I tried this with 2.4.10, 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-pre8-ac5.
I use a 100MB socket queue. (rmem_max)
Could anybody tell me why this happens and a possible fix for this.

Thanks in advance.
