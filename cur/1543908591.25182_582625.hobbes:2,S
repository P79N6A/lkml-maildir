Well, perhaps on i386. I've seen some older versions of the s390 gcc die
with an ICE because I have used "+m" in some kernel inline assembly. I'm
happy to hear that this issue is fixed in recent gcc. Now I'll have to
find out if this is already true with gcc 3.x. The duplication "=m" and
"m" with the same constraint is rather annoying.
