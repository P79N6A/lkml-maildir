I've already offered several thoughts on implementation.  Don't you read
my posts? <g>
The one flag method: Only one search program is allowed.  So it had
better be root only, for updatedb type of thing.  ioctl() on a directory
(or optionally object) atomically does test_and_set on the bit.
Modifying an object clears the bit on its parent directory if it was
set.  And if the parent bit changed, it clears the parent's parent etc.
This stops as soon as you reach a clear bit.
The serial number method.  Any number of search programs are allowed and
don't interfere.  ioctl() does "read number and increment if bottom bit
clear".  Modifying object does "increment number if bottom bit set",
recursively like the flag method.  Only a few bits are required if you
do a combination thing with ctime, and those bits could be stolen from
the NFS revision word.  Exercise for reader: show why that doesn't lead
to lots of inode updates.
Hard links are complicated in both methods.  One strategy is to have a
second flag: "this path may leads to a directory containing a hard
link", and let the find program deal with those paths in the traditional
way.  Most paths do not lead to hard links.
