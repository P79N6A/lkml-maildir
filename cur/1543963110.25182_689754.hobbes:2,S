Hello; I'm trying to compile a module and am a bit confused with what
I should do. The module is using nopage, but since nopage was
converted to fault,
I have no choice but to see if the module will compile with fault. One
of the areas that I'm lost with is NOPAGE_SIGBUS for a return value.
in mm.h The only options I see is VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, VM_FAULT_ERROR. If
anybody has a advice it would be really appreciated.
regards;
