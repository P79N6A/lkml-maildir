It's actually the way the card itself defaults.  Some, not all, cards
automatically default to 0% volume.  This is for no reason, except that
creative (not to name anyone in particular!) said so.

Closed OSs (such as the dreaded windows) initialize, and then load last
mixer settings.  RedHat does this too, because it wants to be simple.  Slack
does not because it doesn't care.

Simple solution, edit your rc.sysinit or rc.local to load the mixer
settings. (You need aumix for this).  Check out your redhat scripts for the
command, I don't remember it at the moment.  somehting like <aumix -l
/etc/myaudiomix.conf> or such.
