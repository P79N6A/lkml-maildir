HI all
I received and discussed Processor-affinity on the SMP-Kernel-list and I
only wanted to ask if there is something in preparation or if someone
(especially Linus :)) is against this ... I was asked this question
beacause someone wanted to do some Matrix-Operations on his SMP machine
and wnated to speed them up by trying affinity ...
Cheers Markus
