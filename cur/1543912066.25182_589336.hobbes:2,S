Subject: [backport] CFS scheduler, -v20.5, for v2.6.22.5, v2.6.21.7, v2.6.20.16

i've uploaded the -v20.5 CFS backport patches, which includes a handful 
of other (small) fixes, again related to cornercases. It can be picked 
up from the usual place:
    
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/
this updates the CFS backport to include the .23-rc4's scheduler plus 
the changes in the latest scheduler tree. Any scheduler problem you 
might find in -v20.5 will likely affect the .23 kernel too so please 
give it a good workout and report any suspicious behavior :-)
