No, "make dep" just produces some errors which usually scroll off the
screen. The exit status from "make dep" is zero. Building the kernel for
i386 wasn't a problem and I don't use any modules in this case. I've put
these "make dep" messages on the mailing list just to let people know.
If no-one reports it then it's probably never going to be fixed.
