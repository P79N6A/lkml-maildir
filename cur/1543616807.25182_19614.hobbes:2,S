The pre-emption patch doesn't change the average latencies. Go run some real
benchmarks. Its lost in the noise after the low latency patch. A single inw
from some I/O cards can cost as much as the latency target we hit.
Its not a case of the 90% of the result with 10% of the work, the pre-empt
patch is firmly in the all pain no gain camp
