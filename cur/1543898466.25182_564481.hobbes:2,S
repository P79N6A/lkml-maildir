Hi All,
  I have an MMC driver for my kit (i.MX21 based cogent board
CSB535FS), which is supplied by Cogent (Kernel version 2.6.16).
   The original driver (linux/drivers/mmc/mmc_block.c) uses
mmc_register_driver() method to register the driver but the one
supplied by Cogent uses platform_driver_register() method. What is the
difference between the two?
Thanks,
Midhun.
