And a colleague of mine has another view...that there will be no OSes in
the future. My references to "crystal ball" and "putting my foot squarly
in my mouth" are attempts to say that noone can predict what will happen
in 38 years in this industry except that we can be fairly certain that it
will look nothing like it is today.
This argument is kinda silly. time_t is obviously broken for 32-bit
systems. There needs to be a fix if people think it will be relevent.
However, IMHO, it should not be part of the kernel proper, or whatever.
