I tried it on my Fujitsu P2120, hoping that the PS/2 resume patch would
help it wake up from S3 properly, but no such luck.  The radeon
framebuffer doesn't restore, and the keyboard doesn't work.  The mouse
might, but there's no way for me to tell.
If I remember correctly, the network functioned properly on resume in
test1-mm2, but doesn't in test2-mm3, so I had to do a reset.
