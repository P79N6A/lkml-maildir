These checks were part of the mount procedure.  Since currently
mount() is a privileged operation, it makes no difference if the check
is made inside the kernel or in a (secure) suid userspace app.

I'd very much prefer a solution, where in certain situations the
privileges required for mount() could be relaxed.  But this involves
more than just a few checks in the FUSE kernel module.
Thanks,
