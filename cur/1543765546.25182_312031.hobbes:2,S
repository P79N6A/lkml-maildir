Me too.  The compiler doesn't really have much choice here.  If
it ignores all comparisons of unsigned integers to less than zero
then we could miss real bugs like this:
int foo(unsigned int val)
{
	return val < 0;
}
where the user probably wanted a signed comparison.
I suppose it could be smart and stay quiet about
val < 0 || val > BOUND
However, gcc is slow enough as it is without adding unnecessary
smarts like this.
