Well, it didn't let me come this far. It just send no packets back at all in
case of not connecting.
But today, the situation is different. I tried several kernels with several
source IPs yesterday night and came to the conclusion that it cannot be a
kernel problem: the same problem arised and vanished on identical disks, but
with different IPs.
So I came to the conclusion that this US-located webhoster in question found a
really nice way to limit traffic by blacklists or some weird IP pattern
matching code, and guess what: _today_ _all_ test configurations _work_.
There are really strange people out there ;-)

Thank you for listening. Sorry for wasting your time.
