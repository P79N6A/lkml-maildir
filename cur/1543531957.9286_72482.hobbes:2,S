    OK, well, can any of these problems that are being discussed be fixed
by changing/reimplementing POSIX threads? Would it help to boost the
priority of the manager thread to realtime? Would it help to change the
way the inter-thread communication works from a pipe to a more low level
mechanism?
   In fact is there any reason that when you do pthread_create, it doesn't
just do a clone() right there? It has to clone, change priority (which you
need the permission to do anyway, right?) and then jump off to the
specified address.. 
   Can someone explain why this had to be done in such a roundabout manner
so that I (we) understand the issues and thus know better how this
situation could be fixed?
