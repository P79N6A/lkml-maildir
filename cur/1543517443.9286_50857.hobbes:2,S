If *ptr is in PCI space it will be uncached, if it is in main memory it will
cause a cache line invalidation on the CPUs holding the line. Any CPU holding
the like in E or S state will go to I, a CPU holding the line in M state
may block the write and write its data from cache to main memory then go I
and allow the transaction to continue.
On non PC hardware things can of course be very different indeed.
