you could do:
nm -n /path/to/module.ko | grep -v '\( [aUw] \)\|\(__crc_\)\|\( \
$[adt]\)'>/path/to/module.map
This is essentially what mksysmap does, except with the ability to
define 'nm' locations. This isn't really a file that could be used in
place of the System.map file though. At least not if I understand the
purpose of it.
The System.map file is used to keep track of symbols in the kernel. I
believe the module symbols can be traced with the aid of some of the
debug kernel configuration options.
