Subject: BUG: 2.6.20 atkbd spams console after kernel panic

The kernel panic is my fault, but I'd still like to see the on-screen
messages when it happens.
Unfortunately, 2.6.20 atkbd.c continuously spams the console after a
kernel panic (my fault), with these messages:
...
kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program might be trying access hardware directly.
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program might be trying access hardware directly.
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program might be trying access hardware directly.
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program might be trying access hardware directly.
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program might be trying access hardware directly.
...
These appear to be getting generated in response to the flashing of the keyboard LEDs
in response to the kernel panic.
Could somebody fix this please?
Cheers
