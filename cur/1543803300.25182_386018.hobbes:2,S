It's not a very informative message but probably just means the kernel is 
complaining about what that (evil) program hdparm is trying to do. Anyway 
this kernel is _ancient_. Please move to a newer one if you can (yes I 
understand the reasons stick to older kernels so don't bother explaining them 
- that's why I said "if you can").
Cheers,
Con
