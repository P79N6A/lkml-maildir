Reusing a kiobuf for a request involves setting up the length, offset
and maybe errno fields, and writing the struct page *'s into the
maplist[].  Nothing more.

We've already got measurements showing how insane this is.  Raw IO
requests, plus internal pagebuf contiguous requests from XFS, have to
get broken down into page-sized chunks by the current ll_rw_block()
API, only to get reassembled by the make_request code.  It's
*enormous* overhead, and the kiobuf-based disk IO code demonstrates
this clearly.  
We have already shown that the IO-plugging API sucks, I'm afraid.

Gig Ethernet, HIPPI...  It's not so bad with an intelligent

So you mean we'll introduce two separate APIs for general zero-copy,
just to get around the problems in the single-page-based on?

Only tcp and ll_rw_block.  ll_rw_block has already been fixed in the
SGI patches, and gets _much_ better performance as a result.  udp
doesn't do any such clustering.  That leaves tcp.
The presence of terrible performance in the old ll_rw_block code is
NOT a good excuse for perpetuating that model.
