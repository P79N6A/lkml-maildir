No, this in unrelated. This message tries to tell you that the old
behaviour of changing the source address implicitly to the source
address routing would use for a DNATed connection is no longer done.
This behaviour changed in 2.6.11, so if everything worked in 2.6.15,
you should be fine.

This is a known problem with NAT and HW checksum and will probably get
fixed in 2.6.19. The message is just a warning, everything should work
fine.
