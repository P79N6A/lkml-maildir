I noticed this happening a few months ago when I was testing 2.4.20 on a
couple of similar 486 laptops.  About 25% of the time, the disk would spin
down, then up again, after the flushing IDE devices message.
I think that the argument against doing the flush first, then the standby,
was that some drives would abort, or wait on the flush, but I never saw a
conclusive answer to it.
Am I the only person who observed the spin down, and immediate spin up
behavior?
John.
