Those "invalid assumptions" crept into documentation. Everybody knew
heap starts at the end of bss in 1995.

That's not the problem. Problem is that programs assume
brk(0x12345678) allocates space between end of bss and 0x12345678;
which is no longer the case.
And actually even
http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/brk.html
 only talks
about "ammount of space"... implying begging of that space is well
known.

PS: It would be nice to fix linux man pages to say that it brk() moves
end of the heap, only, and that any usage of brk() is invalid w/o
doing brk(0) before.
