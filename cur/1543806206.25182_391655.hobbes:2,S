I dont see a way  which differentiates between open fd & dup fd. The
only  difference between them is that when doing open it allocates a
new file structure & initializes it while in case of dup the same file
pointer. That's how you share the locks & seek offsets. But I dont see
any kernel code which makes this difference currently. Implementing
this should not be that hard any way
