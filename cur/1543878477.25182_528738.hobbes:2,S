Greetings Guys & Dolls;
I give up, I'm whupped.
When I installed FC6, I let it use LVM2 to handle the disks because I was 
tired of fighting with the most broken, nasty, evil disk partitioner ever 
dreamed up, disk druid.  I personally think that abomination was written 
by an M$ plant, specifically to poison users against linux.
Now the 64k$ question: While running with LVM2 managed disks, is it 
possible to run without dm_mod, the device-mapper?  If so, please tell me 
how to achieve this.
I rebooted last night, from 2.6.21-rc6 to 2.6.21-rc6 and for some reason 
device-mapper went from #252 (cat /proc/devices) to #254, and has also 
been seen at #253 in addition to the temporary address of #238 where it 
was before that patch was reverted for 2.6.21-rc6
Anytime this changes, the device numbers in a stat report change, and tar 
thinks its all new & restarts everything on a 45GB system from a level 0.
My vtape setup only has room for 8.5GB per vtape, so the catchup time is 
many days.  I can speed that up by temporarily making the vtape bigger in 
my amanda.conf, but now the disk itself that the vtapes are on is at 96% 
and will not tolerate another such catchup run.
So I'm pleading for either a stable, known address for device-mapper, or a 
workaround that will immunize tar against its apparently uncontrolled 
wanderings.
Please, pretty please, with sugar and cream in it even, please, give some 
stability to this situation....
