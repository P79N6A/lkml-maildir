No:
Mac <-> 100 Mbps switch <-> gigabit switch <-> Linux
One possible explaination, even if unlikely, might be that Linux 2.6.10 is
faster than 2.6.8, so the Mac start missing packets.
If you want me to make tests, I can switch back to 2.6.10 at night, perform
tests, and switch back to 2.6.8 before production resumes in the morning.
