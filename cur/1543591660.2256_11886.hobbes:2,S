Why?  Encoding sounds funky... you don't get normal
ls behaviour, etc.
I think I'd prefer something like /dev/hda/table, where
table is something like /proc/partitions for /dev/hda, but
it's read/write ;-)

What about partition editing on other OSs?  There's no reason
why fdisk/parted/etc. should be Linux only.  Why should the kernel
need to know how to write partition tables?
Also, different partition table formats have different alignment
constraints (which is relevant for creating partitions).  These
mainly need to be respected for other braindead OS's and/or BIOSes.
Communicating those between user/kernel space doesn't excite me.
Any ideas?

Libtool & friends deals with version skew (ugly, but it works...)
You can write wrappers for libraries.
That said, a kernel API would be nice, if it was doable...
