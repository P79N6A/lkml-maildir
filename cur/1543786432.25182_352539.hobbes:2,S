Hi,
I'm experiencing problems with suspend to RAM on my Dell D600 laptop.
When I run Ubuntu's 2.6.10 kernel I have no problem with suspend to RAM.
However, when I run 2.6.13, my laptop sometimes doesn't wake up. It
seems like the longer my uptime, the more likely the problem is to occur
(which makes it hard to reproduce sometimes). This happens even with a
non-preempt kernel.
I posted my .config here
http://people.xiph.org/~jm/config-2.6.13-i386
My hardware is:
Dell Latitude D600 (Bios rev. A14)
Pentium-M 1.6 GHz / 1 GB RAM
ATI Technologies, Inc. Radeon Mobility 9000 M9 (R250 Lf)
Any idea how to solve this?
