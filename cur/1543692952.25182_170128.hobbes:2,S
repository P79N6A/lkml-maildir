No. I mean "ban" like we ban CLONE_THREAD w/o CLONE_DETACHED.
Remember, the last stable release of the kernel (2.4.xx)
didn't have the ability to do CLONE_THREAD at all. So it
isn't as if real-world apps are depending on the ability
to do CLONE_THREAD w/o sharing file descriptors.
Got a legitimate must-have real-world use for it?
