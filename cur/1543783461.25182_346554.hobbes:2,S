Darn.  You have a point there.

Hmm.  Good point.  I hadn't considered that.  I am now certain
it only exists when CONFIG_PM is set.
Thinking about it more I probably want to simply have a
kernel_power_off_shutdown(); common factor and call
that instead of device_shutdown().
Ok some sleep and then I will see if I can better version of this
