Why do we need var arg support?
Can't we do that with a shim we load from user space?

We can't keep the same idt and gdt as the pages they are on will be
overwritten/reused.  So explictily stomping on them sounds better
so they never work.  We can restore them on kernel reentry.

Why rename relocate_kernel?
Ah.  I see.  You need to make it into a pointer again.  The crazy don't
stop the pgd support strikes again.  It used to be named rnk.
More later.
