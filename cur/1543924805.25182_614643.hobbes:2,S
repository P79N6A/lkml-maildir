hmm, I wonder if it would be a good idea to put together a git hook
script that looks for things that look like git commit ID's, and if
they aren't valid commit ID's that appear in the repository, the
maintainer gets a warning when they do a "git am" or otherwise suck in
a patch that was sent via e-mail...
