Great, this is long overdue for a cleanup.
I haven't looked at all users of this, but does it make sense to switch
to an API that takes an address range and modifies / filters it? Perhaps
also filling in some other annotations (eg. alignment, topdown/bottom up).
This way you could stack as many arch and driver callbacks as you need,
while hopefully also having just a single generic allocator.
OTOH, that might end up being too inefficient or simply over engineered.
Did you have any other thoughts about how to do this more generically?
