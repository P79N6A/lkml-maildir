I don't understand. The .config drives the kernel build, I don't get XFS 
functions and names if I don't compile it. I have different symbol 
names... At least, that's what I understand... and that's what 
happens... Never the same names on different kernels.

Yes, ok.

Yes, but as long as you keep with the same configuration, no problem 
should arise in changing the kernel version.

I probably expressed myself badly. I don't mean anyone having the same 
configuration... why on earth should it be?

I hope! :)

That's why you recompile, but why should you throw your other modules 
not included in the kernel release?

That's weird... why should things really change so drastically if the 
external interface still remains the same? It's probably a matter of 
abstraction...

Ok.

I'd really like to know... I'm naive? Yes :) Of course, other than 
``more work'', but technical disadvantages...
