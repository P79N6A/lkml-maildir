Wouldn't it be saner to refuse the offlining request if the CPU has tasks
which cannot be migrated to any other CPU?  I mean, the operator has gone
and asked the machine to perform two inconsistent/incompatible things at
the same time.
Look at it this way.  If we were to merge this patch then it would be
logical to also merge a patch which has the following description:
  "if an process attempts to pin itself onto an presently-offlined CPU,
   the kernel will choose a different CPU according to <heuristics> and
   will pin the process to that CPU instead".
Which is the same thing as your patch, only it handles the two events when
they occur in the other order.
No?
