Subject: BIG problem with BusLogic SCSI and/or something else

I tried to add a new Hard disk. It's s Seagate ST39102LW 8.1 Gb.
In the BIOS setup of the BusLogic adapter, I was able to format
and verify the disk with no problems whatsoever.
fdisk seemed to work okay. I made partitions.
mke2fs would fail (hang the system) while writing inodes.
The BusLogic driver would complain about "Aborting SCSI host 0 channel 0,
pid 84446".
This can't be a pid --anyway.
I downloaded what preports to be the latest e2fsprogs-1.19. Still the
same problem.

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 1106.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

Eventually everything gets deleted (a whole root file-system). This was
a mirror of my usual root file-system. It blew up when I was trying
to tar from one to another.

When the BusLogic driver was going through its hour-long fits of
resetting the bus, it rewrote the NVRAM configuration in the controller
so that the disk-drives were not at the same logical addresses when
I attempted to reboot. It turned on SECAM (whatever that is), and
scattered the addresses of the drives all over the place so the boot
drive was not found.
I thought that SCSI controllers were required to use the hardware address
of the drives, however there is something strange. The boot drive had
been moved from 0 to 15.
It was only after I found this obscure configuration junk that the
drives were able to be found where the physical bits put them.
