Now that you say that, I did have problems in the May-June time frame 
with AHCI. The machine has since been redeployed, but I doubt that it 
was a Jmicron controller, it was whatever Dell was shipping when 
Pentium-II was still in use. I dropped in a new UHCI card and the 
problems went away.
Andrew, I don't know if using another interface is an option for you, 
but it might be useful information if you could try.
