The PCI probe paths and the setup paths of several of the PATA
controller drivers know they are single threaded in a few spots so it
wouldn't suprise me in the slightest. Really this async stuff needs to
spend 2 or 3 months in -next getting the kinks worked out so that driver
assumptions can be pinned down and fixed, and someone can give it an API
with names that anyone but Arjan understands ;)
