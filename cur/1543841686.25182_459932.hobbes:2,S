There is no 'Fedora default config'. We ship a number of different kernels,
some of which enable PAE, some disable it.
For FC5, the installer installs a PAE kernel if you have >4GB, or SMP.
For FC6, it'll only install one if you have >4GB.
(or possibly if you have an NX capable CPU, I forget if we enabled that
 magick in the installer)
Precluding NX support + swsusp kinda sucks, but I guess it's a tiny subset of users.
