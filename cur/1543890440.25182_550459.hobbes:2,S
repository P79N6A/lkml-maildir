It turns out that setting the pte accessed bit in hardware
can apparently take a few thousand CPU cycles - 3000 cycles
is the number I've heard for one CPU family.
This is a similar number of cycles as is needed to zero out
a page.  Giving a cache hot page to userspace could cancel
out the rest of the cost of the page fault handling.
Lets stick with the simpler MADV_DONTNEED code for now and
save the page flag for something else...
