Hm, I don't think it is unhappy about looking at NV_INT_STATUS_CK804.
I'm running 2.6.20-rc5 with the INT_DEV check removed for 8 hours now
without a single problem and that should still look at
NV_INT_STATUS_CK804, right?
I just noticed that my last email might not have been clear enough. The
exceptions happened when I re-enabled the return statement in addition
to the debug message. Without the INT_DEV check, it is completely fine
AFAICT.

I'll see if I can schedule a test run for tomorrow, I currently need
this box.
Thanks,
