the sched.c bits look clean enough.
i like the generic concept - keeping the userspace fast-path for
lock/unlock, like for futexes, and registering/unregistering a lock via
the kernel.
but, couldnt there be more sharing between futex.c and fusyn.c? In
particular on the API side, why arent all these ops done as an extension
to sys_futex()? That would keep the glibc part much simpler (and more
compatible) as well. You'd still get all the glory of implementing true
priority inheritance and advanced RT-locking for Linux :-)
or are the two interfaces way too different?
