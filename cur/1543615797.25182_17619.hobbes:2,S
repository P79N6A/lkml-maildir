With the standard linux kernel it is true. You can't have true
multidesktop systems. The console system is not designed for it. 
One it has lots of global variables including locking. Second the 
keyboard driver can't send keyboard input from different keyboards
to different VTs. Can it be done? Yes but it requires a console system
rewrite. Has it been done? Yes I have done it:
http://linuxconsole.sf.net
Will it go into 2.5.X? Well I have piece by piece putting the new console
code into the dj tree to slowly be intergrated into Linus tree.
