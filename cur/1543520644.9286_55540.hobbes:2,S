hai all,
I want to install libc-5_4_46_bin_tar.gz in my system.
I have the ollowing configuration.
redhat  6.0
intel 686
I did
cd  /
tar -zxvf  libc-5_4_46_bin_tar.gz
then copied libc.so.5.4.46 and libm.so.5.0.9  to  /usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib/
is it  enough to get it installed.
Also how can I install this as an rpm.
thanks in advance
rgds
