One thing to add is that you do NOT have to be a crowd-pleasing politican
and make every change that some random person on lkml suggests.
Indeed, because you're getting comments from a large group of individuals
and not a single entity, you may get flat-out contradictory feedback.
Obviously, comments from the maintainers of subsystems you're touching
should be accorded significant weight, but you can disagree with Linus
if you have a good enough reason.  What you should do is think about the
comments and, if you disagree, explain why your way is better.
