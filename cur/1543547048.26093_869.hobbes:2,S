It does. That leaves caring about the internal structures to fs - you
don't want fscked block bitmap on ext2, you've got to protect it yourself.
Sorry.

That's what had been done. BTW, pure vnode interface leaves all 
namespace-related race-prevention to fs writer. And they tend to fsck
up. "They" include Kirk, so... I wouldn't call it simple. Moreover, tons
of the code are duplicated (with slight variations in the set of present
bugs) in all filesystems.

It got much simpler.
