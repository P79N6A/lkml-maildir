Ok, that I agree with.

Yes. _Once_ in their lifetimes.

If Intel makes the SSE3 registers twice as wide (or creates new ones), the 
xorps trick simply will not work.

Actually, even control parts likely _will_ be be zero, the way people 
work.

Andrea, that's the whole _point_.

Even then, having a reliable failure that is easy to pinpoint it a lot 
better than random behaviour that has taken us more than two years to even 
_find_.
Besides, zeroes for initial values of control registers actually _is_ 
fairly likely, in my opinion. I've sent off an email to my Intel contacts 
to try to make this architected..
