Well... there is no apparantly about it, I have just bought new disks
(segates) and have found Fs corruption yet again (I posted to the list
previously)
something else of interest to you though
USER       PID %CPU %MEM  SIZE   RSS TTY STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         4  0.0  0.0     0     0  ?  Z   Jul 23   0:50 (kswapd
<zombie>)   
kswapd died on me too... 
there was an oops too that but I recompiled the kernel so the system
map(?) would have been different 
this box is an smp box with a diamond fireport card driving the disks
and a mere half gig of ram (not that really makes a difference I would
have thought
Cheers
Craig
