Previously the 802.2 llc1 code was statically linked when TR was selected,
problem is now the llc1 code is not separated from the llc2 one, which is
way bigger, my plans are to:
1. make llc1 be available separately, so that we can have the previous
   behaviour
2. to make TR be available as a module
Suggestions on better ways to deal with this are welcome...
