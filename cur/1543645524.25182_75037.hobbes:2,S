> Does it work in 2.4.20-pre-ac?
In 2.4.20-pre8 and in 2.5.33 the disks on a HPT366 are
detected without CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366 being present.
Look at 2.4.20-pre8 in ide-pci.c and find an explicit list
ide_pci_chipsets that is walked by ide_scan_pcidev().
In 2.4.20-pre8ac2 and in 2.5.38 this HPT366 is not seen
without CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366. The routine ide_scan_pcidev()
in setup-pci.c walks a list ide_pci_drivers that is
initially empty. HPT366 will only add itself when hpt366.c
is present and its hpt366_ide_init() invokes
ide_pci_register_driver().
So, all is well in both worlds, but one has to add
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366=y to .config now.
Long ago that would cause corruption, but so far
I have not seen any bad effects with recent kernels.
All the best - Andries
