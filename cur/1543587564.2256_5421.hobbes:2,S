Is it really? If a program is using thread to handle IO things,
then:
a) It's not going to create a thread for every IO! So I think
the argument is suprious anyway.
b) You _still_ want the child to run first. The child
will start the I/O and block, then switching back
to the parent. This maximises the I/O thruput without
costing you any CPU. (Reasoning: The child running
2nd will increase the latency which automatically
reduces the number of ops/second you can get).
