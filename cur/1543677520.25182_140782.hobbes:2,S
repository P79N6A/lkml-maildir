Hi,
I am trying to write to a function in the kernel which could create a file and add data to it. I am unable to do it, as I am getting Null Pointer Error. I am using threads for this. I dont know if I am going right. Could someone help me with this. How do I write a function in the kernel which could create a file, and write data to it. Somehow, sys_open and sys_read are not working. I think I am doing some mistake somewhere. Please help me. Thanks in advance.
Sumit
