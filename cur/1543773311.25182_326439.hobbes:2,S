Hi all
I am pretty new to the list and I've already searched the FAQ but I
didn't find a hint how to do it.
I want to map the Linux ARM exception vectors to any specific address
and I want to know whether it is enough to modify vectors_base() in
include/asm_arm.h to achieve this or if there are more contraints I
don't know.
I know that this is not the ARM mailing list but it is more a general
question.
Would be nice if anybody could tell me which files I have to modify
to do this.
Thanks in advance!
Michael Gollnick
