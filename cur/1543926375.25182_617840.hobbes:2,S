By magically doing the request of the pin ? See below.

Eek, that's completely wrong. Allowing to access a resource _before_
it is assigned and then doing the assignment implicit is a really bad
idea.

There is no reason to do that if you actually have a useful reference
to the chip _before_ accessing the pin.

This still does not solve the lookup, which is done for each operation
on a pin (direction setting, read, write).
