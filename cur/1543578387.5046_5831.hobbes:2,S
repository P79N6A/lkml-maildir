There is a patch to the LVM kernel code which should help:
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.4/2.4.0ac4/lvm-fix-2
You should also get the LVM user tools from CVS (with TAG LVM_0-9-patches)
to solve this problem.  There will hopefully be a new LVM release soon.

Actually, unless you are simply doing this for testing, it is best to
have only 1 partition for the whole disk.  It wastes less space.
Cheers, Andreas
