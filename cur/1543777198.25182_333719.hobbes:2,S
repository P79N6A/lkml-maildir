Gentoo 2.6.12 kernels provide the skge driver which supports this hardware (I
believe). skge will be included in mainline 2.6.13.

The driver updates that syskonnect released are ugly and have been rejected by
the network driver maintainers. skge was written as a response to this.
The very latest sk98lin updates add support for the new Yukon-II PCI-express
adapters. These are not supported by skge -- the Yukon-II is very different
and will eventually be supported by a separate driver. The techniques which
sk98lin uses to support two vastly different network chipsets (yukon/yukon-II)
in the same driver are generally not accepted in the kernel.
