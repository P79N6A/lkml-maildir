Is that true? Hmm. That would indeed be a strong argument. However, I was 
also a bit alarmed by how one of the fixes for this warning was itself 
actually buggy by dropping the "return" statement altogether and falling 
through.

Hmm. Sparse already has a "verbose" level, although right now it's not 
actually used by anything (it used to enable some warnings that were due 
to sparse deficiencies, but I fixed that particular problem).
