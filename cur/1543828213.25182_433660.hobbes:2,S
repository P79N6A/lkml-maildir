Which is not really important anymore, as soon as you already _know_ the 
future error.

That's because the tick length is not applied in the same way in 
sim-main.c and time.c, if the drop happens around a call to 
second_overflow(), one gets the old value and the other gets the new 
value. If you prevent the drop around a ppm change, it will work just 
fine, it's a bug in the simulator.

Overshooting is not your real problem in this case, as large offsets and 
lost interrupts are less a problem. You're making it way too complex...

The new simulator is far too complex and I don't want to spend the time 
verifying it does a really correct simulation, I don't think it's really a 
good idea to make the simulator more complex than the subject, otherwise 
you need a simulator to test the simulator...
You are also using rather smallish adjustments, changes of upto 1ms/s are 
more realistic (NTP allows a MAXPHASE offset which is spread over a period 
of time). Your simulator is also fixed to 1GHz and 1000Hz, which are 
rather convenient values.

As I said it looks ahead to the next error, if we adjust the multiplier at 
the current tick, it also changes the error at the next tick.

Huh? If the NTP adjustment isn't changing, clock and NTP are hopefully in 
sync and there is no (significant) error to adjust.

Please forget this one, it doesn't really apply here. We know more about 
the model, which allows for simpler calculations. You have to throw away 
information to fit it into the PID model.

I guess it's basically a FLL.
Below is another patch, which better takes the update delays into account.
bye, Roman
take the offset better into account by applying the current adjustment
to the error and anticipate a possible large adjustment at the next
update due to a large offset.
