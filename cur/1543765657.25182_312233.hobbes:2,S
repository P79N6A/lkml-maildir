For the copy_from_user() operation, we're still talking about virtual
memory. In virtual memory terms, each userspace program resides in the
lower addresses, while the kernel takes up the higher addresses. The
user program can pass the kernel any virtual memory pointer it feels
like.
The kernel first checks that it won't try to read from itself, simply by
checking that the last page, belonging to the highest virtual address of
the supposed buffer, does not belong to kernel space. So far so good.
Now the only thing that can go wrong is that the user program told the
kernel that the buffer exists, but some or all of the pages are not
mapped in virtual memory. This is taken care of "transparently" during
the copy -- if we try to copy from a page that isn't mapped, the kernel
will catch the exception, realize that the buffer was bogus, and return
an error.
All of this works because virtual memory is much more restrictive than
physical memory in terms of what data resides where.
