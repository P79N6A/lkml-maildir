Hmm. I don't have this file on my system:
root@micah-64:/proc/sys/kernel/sched_domain/cpu0/domain0# ls
busy_factor  busy_idx  forkexec_idx  idle_idx  imbalance_pct  max_interval  min_interval  newidle_idx  wake_idx
root@micah-64:/proc/sys/kernel/sched_domain/cpu0/domain0# uname -a
Linux micah-64 2.6.23.1 #1 SMP Fri Nov 2 12:25:47 PDT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Is there a config option I'm missing?
Thanks,
