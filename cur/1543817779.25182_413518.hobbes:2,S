Let me test this patch out.  I'm ok with the changes for handling  
both PCI and platform driver.  However, I need to take a look at the  
renaming of the fsl driver.  The "dr" device supports device and OTG  
modes.  I'm concerned about how we distinguish that in the future.
(also, we need to fixup arch/powerpc/sysdev/fsl_soc.c)
