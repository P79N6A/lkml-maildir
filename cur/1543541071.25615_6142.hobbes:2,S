Hello,
I am using redhat linux 6.2 and struggling to
get it to ip forward or route.
This is for a simple packet filter firewall (a router)
before trying to masq/proxy.
PC has two NICS - one internal (network) and one 
external (internet) well that's the plan.
I found out that problem is to do with using
one nic on a switch and the other one on a hub (obviously one's
half duplex and one's full duplex)
When i use 2 or 3 NICs in a pc all using the same switch or hub 
- all's well
When one NIC is used on a switch and the other on a hub here's
what happens
I can ping out on one say eth0 to target host on hub
I can ping from target host to eth0.
On the other nic (eth1) i can ping out to a different host  on switch
But host on switch can't ping me (target).
(Well no ICMP reply messages in ping (it freezes) but ping does not say
no route to host - something's wrong here. I could be pinging from
target system to this same host and getting ICMP reply at the same time)
Conversely
I can ping out on eth0 to host on switch
I can ping from target host to eth0
On the other nic (eth1) i can ping out to a host on hub
But host on hub can't ping me.
NICs are Baynetwork 310 tulip types.
Above is clearly indicative of a problem and it won't ip forward till
it's sorted out.
1, Can linux route reliable with one nic on a hub and one on a
  switch?
Any help appreciatted
Kevin
