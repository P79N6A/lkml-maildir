The 2.4.0test9 Changes file mentions the following and I'd like
to know if after installing updated packages, if I'll still be
able to use a 2.2.x kernel ok, or if I'll have to resort to
initscript trickery:
Will the following work with 2.2.17 as well?
o  util-linux             2.10o                   # kbdrate -v
o  modutils               2.3.15                  # insmod -V
o  PPP                    2.4.0                   # pppd --version
I'm particularly concerned with the modutils 2.3.15.  During the
2.0.x -> 2.2.x transition I was not able to use the same modutils
with both kernels and had initscripts determine the kernel
version, and uninstall the RPM and install the proper RPM for
modutils.
I've not tried to dual boot (2.2.x/2.4.x) a system yet, so any
help would be appreciated.
