Pekka, it would be better if you could sort out most of the
basic issues with lirc directly with the developers of lirc
and then prepare a complete patch series and post that to
lkml. Incrementally adding one driver after another. Posting
patches to non-existent sources to lkml is pointless. First
create a discussion base, please.

You might want to fix the directory structure first and check
which drivers already exist in-tree.
Also, as Vincent noted, most drivers have to be converted
to use the input layer first.
