Subject: [PATCH] ask users to provide /proc/cmdline when REPORTING-BUGS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/10/177

The kernel commandline a user uses with his kernel is useful info.
Time and time again I see mails on lkml asking users if they used some
commandline option or another when booting the kernel. So it seems to
me that it would be useful if people who took the time to read 
REPORTING-BUGS would by default include that info with their bug reports.
