I bet your problems would be solved by upgrading your dist to sid, as woody is 
pretty old, and does not contain the all the fixes in sid. Although I could 
be wrong, and all your troubles might be solved by a 'apt-get install 
modules-init-tools', in any case it is you distribution that is the problem, 
not the linux kernel, so please report this to the appropriate mailing list 
or support forum.
Another point would be that this is really a distribuition problem, and 
usually is solved by searching the appriopriate mailing list or forum.
