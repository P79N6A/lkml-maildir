Sorry, it won't.

dentry->d_flags is a combination of the S_ flags, not O_ flags.
E.g. S_SYNC, S_NOATIME etc.
inode->i_flags is a combination of the DCACHE_ flags.
E.g. DCACHE_AUTOFS_PENDING, DCACHE_REFERENCED tc.
To detect if anyone has the file open for writing, you'll a new count
field which keeps track of writer references.  Something like this:
	if ((arg == F_RDLCK)
	    && ((atomic_read(&inode->i_writer_count) != 0)))
You'll also need to modify all the places where that needs to be
maintained.
Btw, I'm not sure why the F_WRLCK case needs to check d_count and
i_count.  Isn't it enough to check d_count?  Won't all opens reference
the inode through a dentry?:
