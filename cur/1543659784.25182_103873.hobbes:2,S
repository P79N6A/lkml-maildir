Please apply this over the earlier patch.  As Andrew pointed out,
the above patch will cause crashes when per-cpu areas are modified to 
allocate for cpu_possible cpus only.
Reinit of prof_counter/prof_multiplier/prof_old_multiplier seems to be 
redundant (They are already statically inited).  Similar patch worked
for x86 for me.
Thanks,
Kiran
