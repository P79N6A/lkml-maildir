Subject: usbserial/keyspan module load race [was: 2.4.5 keyspan driver]

Ok, I've figured out how to reproduce the problem.
Initially, usbcore and usb-uhci are the only USB drivers loaded.  If I
load usbserial and keyspan seperately ("modprobe usbserial ; sleep 5 ;
modprobe keyspan") everything works correctly.  The problem occurs when
I let modprobe pull in usbserial behind the scenes as a dependency. The
keyspan driver (usually) doesn't detect the device, and /proc/modules
forever lists it as "initializing".  The module won't unload at this
point, so the driver's unusable until the next reboot.
Unfortunately I have no idea how/where to fix this.  Anyone want to
take a stab at it?
