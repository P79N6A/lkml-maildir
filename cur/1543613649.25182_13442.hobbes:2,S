We do this, if the error is "hard". And "fatal" implies hardness, so we're
ok here.

But we're not doing this.
We'd have to save the error into the "struct file" to do the close thing.
Which is what NFS actually already does for other reasons (ie the
asynchronous nature of writes and thus IO errors), so generalizing it
might actually clean some stuff up (sockets have some of the same issues,
but socket semantics may be different enough that we do not want to have
common "error on next access" handling).
