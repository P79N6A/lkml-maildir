	Please, don't. Yes, it can be done. Except that you lose the caching
on inode level. Icache can keep inodes for some time after the last dcache
reference went away. It makes sense, since it saves us a read_inode() if
we are trying to get the same inode soon enough. Your change simply kills
icache. In its current form it gives some kind of aging for inodes. After
your change we may forget about it. Not good. shrink_dcache() is not the
only function that trims dcache. shrink_dcache_parent() is called in 
situations having *nothing* with low-memory situations. Your change makes
it purge icache.
