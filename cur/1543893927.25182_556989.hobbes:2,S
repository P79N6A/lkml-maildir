Sorry 'bout that. Bit busy ATM.
What I was effectively looking for was whether it was data or metadata
that was causing the problems. From the above, it would appear that
dropping the page cache (echo 1 > drop caches) allows a successful
hibernate/resume. Next step would have been to isolate which cache
being dropped made the difference (e.g. a file or a bdev cache?).
However, it is clear from the back traces that there is something
unwell with md/sata code, so I don't think this needs to be tracked
any further from the filesystem perspective.
Cheers,
Dave.
