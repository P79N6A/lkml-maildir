It still blows up though.  Any call to get_cycles() goes:
crypto/tcrypt.c: In function `test_cipher_cycles':
crypto/tcrypt.c:107: error: too few arguments to function
crypto/tcrypt.c:112: error: too few arguments to function
crypto/tcrypt.c: In function `test_hash_cycles_digest':
crypto/tcrypt.c:305: error: too few arguments to function
crypto/tcrypt.c:311: error: too few arguments to function
crypto/tcrypt.c: In function `test_hash_cycles':
crypto/tcrypt.c:361: error: too few arguments to function
crypto/tcrypt.c:375: error: too few arguments to function
because this:
arch/sparc/include/asm/timex_64.h:#define get_cycles()  tick_ops->get_tick()
needs help.
