Agreed. I chatted with Andrew about this, and I think we need
call_usermodehelper to be in a "plugged" state during boot, where it
queues up events but doesn't exec's userland. It remains to be decided
at what point during boot (during initcalls ? after initcalls) we can
"unplug" it tho...
I think it's definitely bogus to try to run userland in the middle of
arch_initcall's.... 
We need this plug/unplug logic (as I wrote separately to linux-pm) for
suspend as well, since we can't affort calling userlands once we have
started suspending devices (and frozen userland).
Ben.
