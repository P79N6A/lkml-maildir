Sure, makes sense I guess.

Sure, psu could be a nice class. We would need buy-in from ACPI, APM and
PMU maintainers to avoid just creating *another* standard that HAL has
to read.

Maybe still send events for large changes, like > whole % changes in
value. Then HAL hasn't got to poll at all.

HAL and gnome-power-manager? There should only be a few changing values
on charging and discharging, and one every percentage point change isn't
a lot.

Fair play. :-)

Ahh, current as in electron flow, rather than current power use,
apologies.

Not sure how to best do this for the kernel - maybe just expose the
value and the format separately. In HAL we normalise the rate to mWh
anyway using the rate in mAh and reported voltage.

Then maybe just set present to false as a destroyed battery isn't much
use anyway...
