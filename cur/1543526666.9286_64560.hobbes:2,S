That's only because noone has created a quick/cookbook solution for this

See Alan's message at the beginning of the thread.  CONFIG_IP_PNP
doesn't work for all cases and interface types, it doesn't fully support
BOOTP, and it doesn't work at all for DHCP which is quickly becoming the
most common (and most maintained) dynamic net client protocol.
The cases for which CONFIG_IP_PNP applies continues to diminish over
time.
In any case it stays for 2.4, and it "has-to-go" in 2.5 so it's a moot
point either way...
