Subject: [PATCH] remove CONFIG_NCR885E from Configure.help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It appears that use of CONFIG_NCR885E was removed in 2.4.2-ac2,
in Config.in and the Makefile in drivers/net.
If it really is the case that CONFIG_NCR885E is history, then it
should be history in Configure.help as well.
This patch, against 2.4.2-ac14, removes CONFIG_NCR885E from Configure.help.
