Add another flag.. Alternatively, the tracer could always do something
like this with the current __WCLONE semantics:
	if (wait4(..normal..) >= 0 || wait4(.. __WCLONE ..) >= 0) {
			...
	}
In either case this is not a wart big enough to break existing behaviour
(especially as the __WCLONE behaviour actually makes sense - libraries
that want to wait on non-regular children _only_ want to use the current
__WCLONE behaviour, which allows them to not ever catch a "normal" child
by mistake..)
