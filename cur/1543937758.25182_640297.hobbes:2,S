since this is about a weird, not fully understood hardware interfacing 
and timing problem, and because my original fix was not really a 
regression fix (but it indeed _caused_ a real regression in a previously 
working setup), i'd lean towards just reverting my patch in .24 and 
going with Takashi's fixes in .25. I.e. the current -git status quo.
