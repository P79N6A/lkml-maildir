I woke up in the middle of the night last night, thinking about this. I
suddenly realized that this cant work with level interrupts.  Oh well,
if we lived in a world of edge only, then it could work. :-/
But still for the fixirq case, it might still be an option to delay the
handler.
But I'm not sure if I fully understand this misrouting irq.  Is it to
fix broken machines that trigger interrupts on the wrong line?  Or is
this some strange case that happens on normal setups?  If an irq does
get misrouted, and we happen to be in the disable_irq of that device
that had its irq misrouted, couldn't it cause a storm if we don't call
the handler for it?  So really disable_irq is broken for the misrouting
case, and perhaps needs to be replaced with a spin_lock_irqsave?
