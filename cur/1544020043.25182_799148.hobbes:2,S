Hi,
As this has happened three times in the last 24 hours, I thought I'd
report this. Whenever my laptop locks up, I have to powercycle. After
rebooting, and fsck.ext4 reports a clean filesystem, often I get a 'no
space on device' error even though I have plenty of disk space left.
Another reboot with a forced fsck.ext4 cures this, every time. This only
happens with ext4 filesystems used as the root filesystem.
