This is the patch that I thought had been eaten from the initio driver. It
is based off of the 2.2.0pre9 version of the ini9100u files. I believe it is
from (Bas Vermeulen) bvermeul@blackstar.xs4all.nl . It provides some
clean-up for the patch I submitted to support the DOMEX 3191U (increments
version number, fixes compiling under 2.0.3x kernels, etc.). For some reason
this patch never made it into the kernel or got reverted (I thought it was
in one of the 2.2.x kernel releases).
