The "umount" uevent has the same problem - the event is emitted at the
start of umount process, but the umount can really complete much later
(e.g., if there was a lot of cached writes).  This is really bad,
because the "umount" uevent cannot be used to tell the user when it is
safe to remove the device.

Hmm, and what should be the proper semantics for such an event?
Currently the "mount" uevent signals that the device is busy (and the
"umount" uevent then should signal that the device is no longer in use,
but that is currently broken).
