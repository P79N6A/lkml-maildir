Thank you for the clarification, and I apologize for my previous email
which went horribly wrong wrt formatting.

Yes, those two patches seem to match up.
However, I am still intrigued by this fix:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/diffs/mm/mremap.c@1.7?nav=cset@1.1136.94.4
It does not seem to be in 2.6.3. I can only assume 2.6.x does not
require it? The Changeset says it is to prevent a potential exploit by
the malicious use of mremap().
