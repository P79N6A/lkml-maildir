	That is elementary.  The running time counts are in JIFFIES,
	which are in the HZ units.  The 'ps' has 'HZ' compiled in
	when it was made.  In fact the system does not tell the internal
	HZ value out in any easy to use way.  So sad.
$ cat /proc/interrupts |grep timer;sleep 1;cat /proc/interrupts |grep timer
  8:   75924461    timer
  8:   75925508    timer
	The delta is  1047  interrupts; HZ at the machine is 1024...
