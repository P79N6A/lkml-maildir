This isn't rocket science guys. Put a file in somewhere in your tree
called ReleaseAnnouncement or something, and ask Linus to adjust his
kernel release process to include the contents of `cat $( find . -name
ReleaseAnnouncement )` in the release message he sends out. Clear out
the file after the release.
Include things such as "bcm43xx is scheduled for removal. build both
b43 and b43legacy as a replacement. Be sure to download the latest
firmware from $URL and follow the instructions there to extract the
correct latest firmware necessary for your chip. There are known
incompatibilities with old udev versions, please ensure blah blah
blah."
