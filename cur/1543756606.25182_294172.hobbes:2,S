	Hi all,
my laptop (Asus M6R, 
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/m6r/
) has problems with
ACPI with newer kernels - most of ACPI operations fail - here is the
sample of error messages printed during boot. All other error messages
contain the "AE_TIME" line as well:
Initializing Cryptographic API

    ACPI-1138: *** Error: Method execution failed [\_SB_.PCI0.SBRG.EC0_.RDC3]

	I cannot read battery status etc. In 2.6.9 ACPI works, in 2.6.10
(and later) it doesn't. I've tried to do a binary search in order to find
an exact change which breaks ACPI for me, and found the following:
2.6.10-rc1-bk11 is OK, 2.6.10-rc1-bk12 is not. So I've diffed the -bk11
and -bk12 trees and tried to trim the patch to an absolute minimum. Now
I have a patch (
http://bugme.osdl.org/attachment.cgi?id=4534&action=view
)
which, when applied to 2.6.10-rc1-bk11, breaks ACPI on my laptop, and,
when subtracted from 2.6.10-rc1-bk12 (using patch -p1 -R), makes ACPI working
in 2.6.10-rc1-bk12.
	However, the patch does not touch anything related to ACPI
(I think). It is a sysfs and kobject update. So I don't see how this
can break ACPI for my laptop.
	It seems the failing methods are always
\_SB_.PCI0.SBRG.EC0_.<something>, and they all try to acquire an internal
mutex using the following code (from my DSDT):
	If (LEqual (Acquire (MUEC, 0xFFFF), 0x00))
	Do you have any idea on what is wrong here? More information,
my source and binary DSDT are attached to the following kernel bugzilla
entry:

Thanks,
