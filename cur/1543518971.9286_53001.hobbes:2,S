Hi,
As someone already have pointed out :
main()
{
	s = socket(AF_UNIX,SOCK_STREAM,0);
	bind(s,.....);
	listen(s,5);
	accept(s,.....); <--- doesn't block 
	....
}
but with select(2) it blocks :) Just checked.
I suspect problem is here :
net/core/datagram.c
static int wait_for_packet(struct sock * sk, int *err)
{
	....
        error = -ENOTCONN;
        if(connection_based(sk) && sk->state!=TCP_ESTABLISHED)
                goto out;                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ should be TCP_LISTEN ?
	....
}
:) Just curious if I'm right.
ps.
Or maybe it's even intended behaviour ?
