Funny, the patches (from 2.5.6 to 2.5.7 and from 2.5.7-pre2 to 2.5.7) I 
downloaded from ftp.kernel.org do contain following patch:
laphish:/usr/src/patches # grep handle_diverter *
patch-2.5.7:- 
			handle_diverter(skb);
patch-2.5.7:+ 
	ret = handle_diverter(skb);
patch-2.5.7-pre2:- 
			handle_diverter(skb);
patch-2.5.7-pre2:+ 
	ret = handle_diverter(skb);
laphish:/usr/src/patches #
My patch reverts this but since you mention that for you it was correct 
I wonder if we're really talking about the same patch so I just 
downloaded them again and I can verify that the problem is really present:
ratz@laphish:~ > md5sum patch-2.5.7.*
f89d55b1e94fbd974d8b3f4625a86a2a  patch-2.5.7.bz2
0f5dec319d693dfe6c528a76e10cd1d1  patch-2.5.7.gz
ratz@laphish:~ > bunzip2 patch-2.5.7.bz2
ratz@laphish:~ > grep handle_diverter patch-2.5.7
			handle_diverter(skb);
+ 
	ret = handle_diverter(skb);
ratz@laphish:~ > rm patch-2.5.7
ratz@laphish:~ > gunzip patch-2.5.7.gz
ratz@laphish:~ > grep handle_diverter patch-2.5.7
			handle_diverter(skb);
+ 
	ret = handle_diverter(skb);
ratz@laphish:~ > rm patch-2.5.7

Cheers,
