Useful in certain situations. For example with
most hardware RAID adapters the adapter creates 
virtual SCSI disks (called containers) and 
hides the details from the host.
In such a system, if these virtual disks are
not initialized (i.e. during virgin installation, 
you will not see any SCSI devices in /proc/scsi
nor will there be a mapping of the driver to
a /dev/sg file. However to create these virtual
disks you have to send ioctl commands to the
driver - hence the problem.
There seems to be two solutions:
1- report the adapter as an additional SCSI 
device, other than what you set the device id 
in the scsi host template.( scsi init skips 
adapter device id when building the /dev/sg 
list and hence it doesn't get mapped to a 
/dev/sg file ) 
OR
2- create an additional normal driver interface 
to the SCSI driver. I'm not sure if anyone's
attempted this. I'd like to hear about it if
it's been done. It should be possible I guess.
