i really don't want to turn this into a thread that never dies, so let
me just clarify what i'm talking about:

let's make sure we're not talking at cross-purposes here, ok?  i see
nothing wrong with someone asking for suggestions for projects in a
particular area, such as, "hey, i'm particularly interested in the
efficiency of R/W operations to flash-based filesystems, can someone
suggest a project in that area that would ultimately be useful to the
kernel community in general?"  that's perfect, no problem there, i
think that's a *great* idea.
however, what the OP seemed to be asking was for suggestions for a
project with a wide-open playing field, with no restrictions whatever,
and that's what i find inappropriate.  someone asking for that kind of
help should at least have put in the effort to narrow the field of
interest.  as i said, that's part of the academic process -- putting
in the time to, minimally, figure out what field you're interested in.
once you do that, then you're good to go.
