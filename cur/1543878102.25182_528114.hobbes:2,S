Oleg is coming from a different case where it was found that exiting kernel
threads were causing problems for nash when nash was run as init in an
initramfs.  While I think that case is likely a user space bug because
nash should check the pid from waidpid before assuming the process it
was waiting for returned.
I do think you can construct valid embedded cases where you can prove
there that among the user space processes certain actions are safe
when they exit that a spare kernel space thread could invalidate.
It just happens that the exit signal of kernel threads just matters on
the other end of system size.
