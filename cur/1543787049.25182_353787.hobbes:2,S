If that is so, it's a bug in linux-mips.  ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is 
supposed to be at least as large as a cacheline.  See this comment in 
mm/slab.c:
/*
 * Enforce a minimum alignment for the kmalloc caches.
 * Usually, the kmalloc caches are cache_line_size() aligned, except when
 * DEBUG and FORCED_DEBUG are enabled, then they are BYTES_PER_WORD aligned.
 * Some archs want to perform DMA into kmalloc caches and need a guaranteed
 * alignment larger than BYTES_PER_WORD. ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN allows that.
 * Note that this flag disables some debug features.
 */
and also this comment (referring to the kmalloc caches):
		/*
		 * For performance, all the general caches are L1 aligned.
		 * This should be particularly beneficial on SMP boxes, as it
		 * eliminates "false sharing".
		 * Note for systems short on memory removing the alignment will
		 * allow tighter packing of the smaller caches.
