It could also simply be that a developer adding a new feature or fixing 
a few bugs is generating more income than a developer working on a 
Linux port.
And no matter how much money you have, you can't always solve such 
issues by adding more developers.

This is no hype, this is reality.
Microsoft has a an enormous market share at the desktop.
And among hardcore gamers an even larger one.

DirectX is simply _the_ state of the art technology you have to use in 
some areas of game development if you don't want to make your game 
technically inferior before you even started developing.
