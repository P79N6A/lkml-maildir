I had fixed my console keymap too, but I've not been able to
figure out how to change the X keymap.  I've been looking in
the /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/ directory, but perhaps XKB is not
being used for old-style keyboard mapping?
Could you provide detailed instructions?  C coding with missing
backslash and bar keys is quite hard :-)
Of course, I still thing its' a 2.6 kernel bug and it should be
fixed.  Vojtech, do you have an idea why it's happening?
