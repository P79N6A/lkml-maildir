I disagree. Keeping the checked-out files _outside_ the repository, and
being able to have multiple checked-out trees from the same repository
with uncommitted changes outstanding while you pull from a remote
repository, etc, is useful.
cvs with cvsup does some of this but has obvious disadvantages, not
least of which being the one-way nature of change propagation. SVN and a
yet-to-be-invented SVNup (hopefully not in Modula-3) this time) may be a
lot closer to what we want.
