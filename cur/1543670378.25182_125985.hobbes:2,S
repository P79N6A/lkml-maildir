I asked this a while ago, but I didn't get a fix, and the problem still
exists...
I'm on an IBM Thinkpad a30p laptop, using a 2.5.66 kernel, and I can't
use ACPI. On bootup, ACPI tables are found, but there is a problem in
the ECDT, and ACPI disables itself. Exerpt from my dmesg is attached.
This problem is not in 2.4 (because the ECDT isn't used?), but it is in
kernels as early as 2.5.50. I haven't checked earlier kernels, but I can
if someone honestly thinks that would help.
I've gotten several emails from other people with similar systems, all
IBM laptops, regarding my earlier posts on this problem, asking if I
found a solution. This leads me to believe that it is an incompatability
with the ACPI implementation on IBM laptops. I, personally, am willing
to accept partial functionality because of a broken BIOS, but right now
I get no ACPI support at all, which is really disappointing.
ACPI section of .config is attached.
I can provide any other details that may be needed, and I will gladly
test bogus patches and dangerous fixes ;-) -- IBM gave me an awesome
warranty on this laptop, and I don't mind losing it for a few days if
they need to replace it.
Thanks in advance.
