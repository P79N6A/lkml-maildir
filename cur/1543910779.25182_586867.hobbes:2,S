I don't think that's feasible.  We're dealing with a situation where:
 - GCC aim to release a new compiler series every 6 months.
   Fortunately, they don't achieve this goal, but they do release every
   12 months or thereabouts [1].
 - Enterprise distros are supported for seven years
 - We still care about people being able to compile kernels on
   enterprise distros that are still supported by their vendor.
Yes, it causes us some pain to support all these different compilers,
but it's not *that* big a pain.
[1] Release dates, according to the GCC website
2007-05-17 4.2.0	(14 months)
2006-02-28 4.1.0	(10 months)
2005-04-20 4.0.0	(12 months)
2004-04-20 3.4.0	(11 months)
2003-05-20 3.3		(12 months, ignoring gcc 3.2 which was really 3.1.2)
2002-05-15 3.1		(11 months)
2001-06-18 3.0
