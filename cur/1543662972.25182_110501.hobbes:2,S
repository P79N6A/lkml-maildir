I'd go with the extra field:
+static int threshold = 0;
 [...]
-count = info->xmit_fifo_size;
+count = info->xmit_fifo_size - threshold;
 [...]
+if (ST16C654) {
+	threshold = 8;
+	ST16C654_set_threshold(threshold);
+}
IO operations are usually quite expensive, so polling should be a last
resort only.
