Subject: [PATCH] scripts/ver_linux : correct printing of binutils version
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Currently scripts/ver_linux prints "Binutils" or other random 
information for the version number in the "binutils" output line 
on some distributions. This patch corrects that.
When I initially submitted a patch to correct that, I was not aware 
that the output from "ld -v" could differ as much as it turned out 
it can, so my original fix turned out to not cover all bases.
This patch works correctly with all the different "ld -v" output 
that people posted in replys to my first patch, so it should be a 
clear win over what we have currently.
Please apply.
