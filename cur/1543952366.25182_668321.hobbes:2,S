Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Bsd_acct: plain current->real_parent access is not always safe
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/17/104

This is minor, but dereferencing even current real_parent is not
safe on debug kernels, since the memory, this points to, can be
unmapped - RCU protection is required.
Besides, the tgid field is deprecated and is to be replaced with
task_tgid_xxx call (the 2nd patch), so RCU will be required anyway.
