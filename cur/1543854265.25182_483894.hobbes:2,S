I bet this is greylisting on infradead.org.  Greylisting will put 
unknown IPs into a database, and /temporarily/ reject the mail, asking 
for the remote mail server to queue it.  Once $GREYLIST_TIME has passed, 
infradead.org will accept the email.  This successfully filters out a 
lot of spammers, and broken SMTP servers that have broken retransmit 
[rules].
You probably need to fix the mail server delivering the mails to 
properly retransmit...
