  Hai all,
   I tried to insert a sample module into Fedora core 2 , But it is giving 
an error message that " no module in the object"
The same module was inserted successfully into Redhat linux 9.
Is there any changes from RH 9 to Fedora Core 2 with respect to the module 
writing and insertion.
Any small help  also welcome.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Manohar.
