I encourage you to inform yourself about MS-WIN and to find you that
you are wrong.
Under MS-WIN, you use either ASPI -> no open fd at all
or you use something that is very similar to my /dev/scg* device 
on Solaris which uses/defines abstract SCSI transport devices instead of 
possibly unknown high level devices like a disk driver.
