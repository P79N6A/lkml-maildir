I have to change SEMMSL in the sem.h file to SEMMSL=250
after I made my change I followed the following steps as directed in the
lenix 5.2 installation guide.
ran make mrproper
ran make config (I took all defaults attempting to keep the rest of the
kernel the same)
ran make dep
ran make clean
ran make boot
everything seemed to be going OK until the end of the make boot.
I get 
boot sector 512 bytes
Setup is 3540 bytes
System is 628kb
System is too big. Try using bzImige or modules.
make[1]: *** [zImage] error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory /usr/src/linux-2.2.5/arch/i386/boot
make: *** [boot] Error 2
What did I do wrong.
thanks in advance for any help
