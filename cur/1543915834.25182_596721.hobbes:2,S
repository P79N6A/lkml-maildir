... and here. Use %zu and lose the casts.
BTW I don't think these macros are such a big win in readability or
code clarity anyway. And I noticed that there are still some open
calls to vmcoreinfo_append_str() in kexec.c (such as for the OS_RELEASE
case) which you haven't macro-ized ... we end up having code that looks
like:
	vmcoreinfo_append_str(...);
	...
	...
	VMCOREINFO_OFFSET(...);
	...
and it's not even obvious (unless you follow on to the definition of the
later macro) that the above two are *exactly* the same. So you could also
consider just losing the macros altogether.
