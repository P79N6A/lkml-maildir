Haven't heard of this one before, but it shouldn't be a pci issue.

People are still working on this one, but it shouldn't be a pci issue.

Yes, that's the x86-* patches in my tree, from Jeff, and I'm not going
to be sending them to you until all of the breakage is fixed up (he
created them for machines that aren't public yet, so I don't think
there's a rush for them to get in anytime soon...)

It sure looks like it's the reason why, as we are suddenly failing with
a NULL pointer problem after we change an integer field into a pointer :)
Linus, it should all be safe for you to pull this tree, as I took
everything that people objected to out of my last attempt :)
