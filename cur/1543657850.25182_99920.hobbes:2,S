If you mean the signal speed regressions they caused - I fixed 
that on x86-64 by inlining 1,2,4,8,10(used by signal fpu frame),16.
But it should not use the stupud rep ; ..., of the old ersio but direct 
unrolled moves.
x86-64 version in include/asm-x86_64/uaccess.h, could be ported
to i386 given that movqs need to be replaced by two movls.

P.S.: regarding recent lmbench slow downs: I'm a bit
worried about the two wrmsrs which are in the i386 context switch
in load_esp0 for sysenter now. Last time I benchmarked WRMSRs on
Athlon they were really slow and knowing the P4 it is probably
even slower there. Imho it would be better to undo that patch
and use Linus' original trampoline stack.
