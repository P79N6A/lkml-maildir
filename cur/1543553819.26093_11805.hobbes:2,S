   Why are you talking  such a nonsense?
The claim was made that pthreads was using signals behind the scenes, so
that programs which weren't expecting that system calls to get
interrupted were getting interrupted.  Hence, one could make the
argument that if the pthreads code had used SA_RESTART to set up its
signal handlers, then this situation wouldn't have come up.
I haven't looked more deeply into this.  As far as I'm concerned,
threads === "more rope" and use of threads should be avoided whenever
possible, even if Linux had a decent threads implementation....
