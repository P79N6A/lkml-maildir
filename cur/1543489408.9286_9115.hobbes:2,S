  Hi, all. I'd like to start out by thanking people who have responded
to my call for testing on AMD CPUs.
I'm calling now for people with AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and
K6-3 CPUs to please try the new patch and verify that bitblt
operations to their PCI/AGP video cards improves.
You will need to read Documentation/mtrr.txt to learn how to
manipulate your MTRRs correctly. I'm interested to hear about
performance improvements (or lack thereof), and also the contents of
/proc/mtrr right after booting completes.
To do this, you'll need to apply the patch to 2.2.3+devfs or the
official 2.2.3. If you don't have devfs, don't worry, it will still
work. Just make sure you set CONFIG_MSR=n and CONFIG_PERFMON=n.
You'll need the MSR patch, available at:

				Regards,
					Richard....
