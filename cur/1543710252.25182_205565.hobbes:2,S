CPU 2: Machine Check Exception: 000...0004
CPU 3: Machine Check Exception: 000...0004
Is what I get now. Previously I also got "Kernel Context Corrupt" in addition 
to the above.
The MCE error can be made to appear when, for example, I'm running a 
configure/compile cycle. I thought it might be a SATA issue so installed 
Mandrake on an IDE drive but I got the same error.
As an aside, I'm running Gentoo with CFLAGS=-O2 -march=pentium4 -pipe ... I 
was running CFLAGS=-O3 -march=pentium3 -mcpu=pentium4 -mmmx -ssse2 (and so 
on) with no difference whatsoever (probably shouldn't be a surprise bearing 
in mind the kernel is compiled with its own flags).
I've run MEMTEST with no errors reported. It's a very interesting problem, 
since with SMP only everything works okay. But SMP+Hyperthreading and, sooner 
rather than later, the thing will bomb.
