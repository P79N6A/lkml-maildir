The maximum PID is far more useful.
PID choice issues:
randomness      NO, maybe if we had 64-bit PIDs...
in-order        NO, we run out eventually, trashing the nice order
small numbers   Yes, "kill 2 4 6 8" is not much to type
avoid recycle   Yes, this reduces race conditions a tiny bit
nice hash       Yes, AIX keeps the low bits unique AFAIK
