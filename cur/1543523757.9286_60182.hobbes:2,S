Mostly one for the archives this, but it's taken me a few days to find
the solution, so I thought I'd share it.
I've been playing with a Rocky 558EV SBC with a K6-3D cpu for the last
week or so.  Under Linux (and all the *BSDs I tried), it would reliably
lock up on reboot after syncing the disks.
The solution is to add
  append="reboot=bios"
to /etc/lilo.conf.
James.
