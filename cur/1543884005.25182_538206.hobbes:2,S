I'm more miffed about what it's cleaning up after than the patch itself.

Sorry about the delay in replying.
I don't mind so long as we're not letting doorstop configs through. I'd
probably do something more like

as a stopgap measure, but I'm not all that interested in grabbing patch
credits where others could do it easily enough. Either of the config
alterations is fine by me as they now stand; maybe Eric Dumazet might
care to do something like my suggestion at some point.
My interest here is in approaches that aren't really centered around
config options. Those are pmd handling for 1GB-unaligned PAGE_OFFSET
in PAE and dynamic vmallocspace reservation, the latter of which is
more complex than the first. I'd probably only do the pmd handling as
it's much easier than dynamic vmallocspace, which does substantial
violence to the core in order to reserve chunks of ZONE_NORMAL's
virtualspace so that no boot-time virtualspace reservations need to be
made for vmalloc(). Basically it would make vmalloc() proper use
physically contiguous memory and vmap() fiddle with ZONE_NORMAL
pagetables while reserving physical memory underlying the virtualspace
reserved for vmap() so that it's no longer necessary to carve
vmallocspace out of userspace to avoid highmem. That would occur at the
cost of runtime memory footprint of the rarely-called vmap() and
ZONE_NORMAL mapping updates. It would also alleviate pressure on
vmallocspace in configurations where it would be severely limited.
I'm doing a bit of thinking about this laptop-avoiding-highmem problem.
I've not come up with any better ideas than the dynamic vmallocspace
approach to avoid ABI damage while avoiding both highmem and sacrificing
memory for 1GB laptops, and slightly mitigating ABI damage for 2GB
laptops' highmem avoidance efforts. I'm thinking the applicability
isn't broad enough to merit the effort of dynamic vmallocspace. The pmd
fixup for 1GB-unaligned splits is not such a big deal in comparison.
