It's best to use a seperate driver for each compiler.  I don't know of
any other way it can bite you, but one way is if you if you have drivers
built with different arch names trying to call the right compiler innards
with -V.  You also need -b archname for it to get it right.
[root]:# gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-linux-gnu/gcc-2.95.2/specs
gcc version gcc-2.95.2 19991024 (release)
[root]:# gcc -V 2.8.1 -v
Using builtin specs.  <== danger Will Robinson. (think about includes etc)
gcc driver version gcc-2.95.2 19991024 (release) executing gcc version 2.8.1
[root]:# gcc -V 2.8.1 -b i486-linux-gnu -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux-gnu/2.8.1/specs
gcc driver version gcc-2.95.2 19991024 (release) executing gcc version 2.8.1
I always diddle Makefile.in to build/install the driver with a non gcc
name for this reason.  Each driver knows where it's innards lives without
needing to be told (and risking me accidentally telling it lies:)
