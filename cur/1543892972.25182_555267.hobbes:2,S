i386 allmodconfig:
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c: In function 'mtrr_trim_uncached_memory':
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:655: error: 'end_pfn' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:655: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:655: error: for each function it appears in.)
I'll poke some ifdefs in there.
