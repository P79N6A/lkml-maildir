If you put it that way, yes - it would classify as duct tape. However 
the code already acted based upon mapped_ratio which is pretty much all 
this patch does. Folded in in that sample patch I sent out earlier you 
can see that all it does is acted on mapped_ratio in a different manner 
so it's not really an extra layer at all.
-	swap_tendency = mapped_ratio / 2 + distress + vm_swappiness;
+	vm_swappiness = mapped_ratio * 150 / 100;
+	vm_swappiness = vm_swappiness * vm_swappiness / 150;
+	swap_tendency = distress + vm_swappiness;
