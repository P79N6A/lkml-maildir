It's not the warning that worries me. It's the apparent oops (keyboard 
leds blinking?) at shutdown/poweroff!

.. and that's my issue! We're too late in the game to try to figure things 
out and leave things hanging. The patch broke something, it needs to be 
fixed or reverted. It's been going on too long.
I think it should have been reverted probably two weeks ago already. We 
can re-apply it early in the 2.6.26 series, and then try to fix it right. 
Since there is at least a patch worth trying now, I'll hold off reverting 
it and wait for Guennardi to test the patch, but the fact is, we shouldn't 
have a known-broken kernel for several weeks, when there is a known fix 
for it in reverting a single commit!
We have _way_ too many regressions as it is. Regressions are bad. Ones 
that have known causes and haven't been fixed in three weeks are 
unacceptable.
