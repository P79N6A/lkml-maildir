This didn't occur until recently.. and I suspect it might be buffer overflow
attempts or it might be the recent tty changes (?)
Either way, for some odd reason, I had people trying to telnet into my machine
from England and other places (I'm in the US) although I don't see the
purpose of that because I have nothing exciting on this little dialup machine.
But, here are the messages:
Jan 20 15:47:56 tristessa telnetd[819]: ttloop:  read: Connection reset by peer
Jan 20 17:19:04 tristessa telnetd[507]: ttloop:  peer died: Invalid or incomplet
e multibyte or wide character

te multibyte or wide character
