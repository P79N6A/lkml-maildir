I'm trying  to use a dlink  dwl 650. On my  laptop with 2.4.18 and  on a
test pc it works with orinoco_cs .
I'm running 2.4.21 on a smp dual athlon and I can't get it working.
I'm already  having some little  problems with  usb on the  computer, it
works only if I pass noapic at  boot time. I thoink about it because the
pci<->pcmcia adapter takes irq 18. The out of /proc/interrupts is
bott@dirac:~/Progetti/quantizzatore-1.0/src > cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
....
 18:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  Ricoh Co Ltd RL5c475
Doen anyone of you know if there are some problem with apic and pcmcia?
Can you please cc your replies to my address? Thank you.
