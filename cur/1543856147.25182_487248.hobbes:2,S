Thanks for your clue. I found increasing this limit could really help
my test cases.
When MemFree < 8M, and the test case request 1M * 8 times, the
allocation can be sucessful after 81 times rebalance, :). So far I
haven't found any issue.
If I make a patch to move this parameter to be tunable in the proc
filesystem on nommu case, is it acceptable?
Thanks,
