Yeah, that discussion with Andrew made me look a bit deeper at my mail folders 
and I realized the last message I received from any of the vger.kernel.org 
mailing lists was late Tuesday night ... I thought Wednesday was awfully

I have no idea what was causing the mail problem, probably somebody in our IT 
department playing around with some new knobs, oh well.  I resubscribed this 
afternoon with both fingers crossed.
