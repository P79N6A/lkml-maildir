Are you sure about this?
I have just this setup, switching mouse, keyboard and monitor by
turning a single mechanical switch, and one of the machines
switched between is running Win95. I've never seen any slowdown
of the repeat rate following switching.

Seamless for that particular machine, or for all machines?
Personally, if I switch between different computers running
different operating systems, I tend to expect them to do things
slightly differently.

Can't help with that, sorry.
Best wishes from Riley.
