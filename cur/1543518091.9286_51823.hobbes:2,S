Maybe that should be configurable somehow.  For me, setting it to
100ms is useless, I an not accustomed to this delay and the patch
itself would not help me if it only guards for 100ms against
repetitions.  Also, we now talk only about PC keyboards, in
pc_keyb.c.  Do you know PC kbds that have delays < 250ms?
