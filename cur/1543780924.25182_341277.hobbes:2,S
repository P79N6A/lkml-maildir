No. What I said is true of both kernel space and userspace.
Samba needs the exact same semantics as NFSv4 has: it needs to prevent a
local open() syscall from succeeding while the CIFS clients that hold
oplocks flush their cached information (data, metadata, locks...) back
to the server.
BTW: the blockage is only temporary. If the clients don't respond within
a certain time period (as set by the global
sysctl /proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time) then the lease will be
pre-emptively broken by the kernel.
As I said, this is _very_ different from what inotify does.
Cheers,
