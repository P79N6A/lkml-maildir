No, there is no memory allocation.

No, because when traversing an array-heap, you don't access contiguous
entries.  You might get one or two more cache hits near the root of the
heap.

You could to that, but then you'd have to deal with memory allocation
failures and memory deadlocks, making add_timer rather complicated.
It's not acceptable for add_timer to fail or require kmalloc().
