Zwane reproduced this and when I compiled an identical kernel for him
it went away; the only difference wsa the compiler version.
i.e. this looks like a compiler issue of some kind.
Boszormenyi, Helge, could I get compiler versions? Zwane had
<zwane:#offtopic> gcc (GCC) 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5)

so this looks like one of the offending compilers; the one I used that worked
was:
$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 3.3 (Debian)
