You can keep an eye on the
"timer + fpu stuff locks my console race"
thread I orignaly created when I found the bug or see here for web version:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108704334308688&w=2
I'll put on a quick 2.4.26 fix that should work (can't test, since my
linux box that I have physical access to isn't wired to the Internett
currently)
