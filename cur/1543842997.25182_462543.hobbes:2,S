You can do that with my proposed __writel which is a simple store as
writes to non-cacheable and guarded storage have to stay in order
according to the PowerPC architecture. No need for __raw.

Ugh ? MMIO space is always marked non-coherent. You are not supposed to
set the M bit if the I is set in the page tables. If you are talking
about main memory, then it's a completely different discussion.

Sure, though that's not the topic.

No. I want precisely defined semantics in all cases.
