I think that the ISA resume will not work with more than 1 card. I'll fix that 
first and test with 3 cards. So the next version can include signed-off-by.
I also wonder about the old el3_cleanup_module() function - it called 
el3_common_remove for all cards. With isa_driver and pnp_driver, it oopsed - 
I think that's because the remove() functions were called by driver core on 
isa_unregister_driver (and pnp_unregister_driver) - but what about MCA and 
EISA?
