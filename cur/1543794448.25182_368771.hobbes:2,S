This still happens with 2.6.14-rc2.
I found a work-around, though. It seems this happens every time I rip an
audio cd and then try to burn a dvd. If I mount a data cd in between, it
seems to work. It seems even a soft reboot is not always enough to clear
problem. 
What is curious, though, is that 2.6.12-rc4 and earlier newer seemed to show
this. With 2.6.13.1 and newer it seems fairly consistent.
