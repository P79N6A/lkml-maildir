If we are serious about allowing ARM to use drivers/Kconfig, then let's
not get distracted by perfection - by trying to do too many changes in
one go.
If, today, we conditionalise MTD or IDE on a certain set of symbols,
then those conditions should be preserved in the first step - it should
be a 1:1 translation.
Later, if there's a need to improve it (as you're suggesting) that should
be a *separate* change.
