Yes, all you need to do is add another PCI id for your chipset to 
drivers/scsi/ata_piix.c:
+ { 0x8086, 0x244a, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, piix4_pata },
Once I add cable detection (PATA is currently limited to UDMA/33), this 
PCI ID entry will change slightly, but the above should get you going.
Note again that ATAPI isn't supported yet...
