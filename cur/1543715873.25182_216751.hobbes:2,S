I am no kernel coder, if its that what you mean.

Ok you got me there. I would suggest to change fasttrak.h like this
to obtain better readability :
#ifndef _ft3xx_h
#define _ft3xx_h
#include <linux/version.h>
#include "/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/hosts.h"
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,4,0)
#define ft3xx {                                                 \
        next: NULL,                                             \
	...
};

It does, which awakened me all up in arms. certainly if gcc-2.95.3
is still mentioned as recommended gcc version for the ia32 platform 
inside /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes. It pissed me off not
being able to use gcc-2.95.3 when using that fasttrak driver.

I agree the fasttrak partial-source kit is not the all defining example.
Still i believe nasty stuff is possible.
