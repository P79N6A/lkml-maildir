I'll bet at the top of this you have a mktemp error.
mktemp turns out to be a PITA to use - on some older systems (e.g.
Mandrake 10 stock install) it has incompatible usage to the rest of the
world. When I will get a convenient infrastructure for making a shell
library, I will probably add a test for this to it.
Try to upgrade your mktemp. That Mandrake 10 user said that urpmi should
have a newer (correct) version.
I will make a patch which will refer to ?time instead instead of
?tim.sec for seconds. That should fix your problem.
