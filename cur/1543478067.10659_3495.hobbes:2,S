A couple of points:
The algorithm has not been released to the general public.
It may yet be patented.
It has not undergone peer review.
The keys are eight times the size of an RSA key.
The algorithm is for public key cryptography.  It does not lend itself to being
a block or stream cypher very well.
Much better use of time would be spent getting known algorithms implemented.
