   I submitted the patch originally.  Otherwise it would release the resource
   that wasn't held for the port I don't have.
   I think the problem is that when deciding if to release the port, it
   considers the _new_ setting of the state->type.  Thus, when you change
   the uart to "none", the previous allocation is not released.
   I think the following (untested) patch should remedy this.  My brain
   is having trouble thinking around this, but the check for releasing the
   region uses the same values used for requesting the region.
A similar change is already in the 2.3 serial driver (and in the 4.90
driver, which will work on either the 2.2 or 2.3 kernel ---
http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/linux/serial
).   So yeah, that should fix
it.  So yeah, it should probably fix things.  (Sorry, I didn't realize
the folks who were complaining where using the 2.2 kernel.)
Once I do a bit more testing, I'll be submitting the newer serial driver
to Alan for inclusion into the 2.2 kernel.
