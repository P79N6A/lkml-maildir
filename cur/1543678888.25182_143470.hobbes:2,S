I have the same problem. I'm using MaxData Mbook 1000T which has
synaptics touchpad too and it stopped working in .72 and still doesn't
work in .73 :-(
Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
 Firware: 4.1
 Sensor: 8
 new absolute packet format
input: Synaptics Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio2
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
I tried to use XFree86 4.3.99.6 with
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/
 driver but that doesn't
work either:
(**) Option "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
(**) Option "LeftEdge" "1900"
(**) Option "RightEdge" "5400"
(**) Option "TopEdge" "3900"
(**) Option "BottomEdge" "1800"
(**) Option "MaxTapTime" "15"
(**) Option "MaxTapMove" "220"
(**) Option "VertScrollDelta" "100"
(II) xfree driver for the synaptics touchpad 0.11.3p2
(**) Option "CorePointer"
(**) Mouse0: Core Pointer
(II) Keyboard "Keyboard0" handled by legacy driver
(II) XINPUT: Adding extended input device "Mouse0" (type: MOUSE)
Synaptics DeviceInit called
SynapticsCtrl called.
Synaptics DeviceOn called
(II) xfree driver for the synaptics touchpad 0.11.3p2
Synaptics DeviceOff called
SynapticsCtrl called.
(--) SAVAGE(0): Chose mode 117 at 85Hz.
Synaptics DeviceOn called
(II) xfree driver for the synaptics touchpad 0.11.3p2
Synaptics DeviceOff called
Doesn't work means that button presses nor touchpad moves are not detected.
btw. which driver provides /dev/input/inputX (as in xfree synaptics
driver documentation) ? I found only /dev/input/eventX driver.
