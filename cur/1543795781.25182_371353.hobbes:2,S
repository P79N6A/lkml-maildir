It was a wonderful FS, but if you used a PrestoServer NFS accelerator
board on the system with 4mb of RAM, but forgot to actually enable the
battery, bad things happened when the system crashed... you got a nice
4mb hole in the filesystem which caused wonderfully obtuse panics.
All the while the hardware keeps insisting that the battery on the
NVRAM board was just fine... turned out to be a hardware bug on the
NVRAM board, which screwed us completely.
Once that was solved, back in Oct 93 time frame as I recall, the Advfs
filesystem just ran and ran and ran.  Too bad DEC/Compaq/HP won't
release it nowdays....
