Yes, the current MB/GB units are awfully ambiguous, but using Mi/Gi won't
cure the confusion as nobody will know whether MB/GB in that text means
the old-fashioned name of binary megabyte or the decimal megabyte according
to the new standard. Yes, the confusion might die out after a long period
of time of everybody switches to the new system, but I seriously doubt
it will happen in the near future.
It seems that the only way which is going to work is to create a new decimal
prefix for units of information as well. Not a particularly nice solution,
but probable the only working one.
				Have a nice fortnight
