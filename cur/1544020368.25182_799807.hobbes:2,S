Finding the below was easy enough...
/* POSIX.1c requires that there is mutual exclusion for the `rand' and
   `srand' functions to prevent concurrent calls from modifying common
   data.  */
__libc_lock_define_initialized (static, lock)
...
long int
__random ()
{
  int32_t retval;
  __libc_lock_lock (lock);
  (void) __random_r (&unsafe_state, &retval);
  __libc_lock_unlock (lock);
  return retval;
}
...but finding the plumbing leading to __lll_lock_wait_private()
over-taxed my attention span.
