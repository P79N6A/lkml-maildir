The [PTBL] part just says that this 2.4 kernel first concluded to
a 155061/16/63 geometry but then saw the partition table and
changed it mind to 9729/255/63.
It is unrelated to partition recognition.
Check that your kernel was compiled without CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED,
or, in case you selected advanced, has CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION selected.
If it is something else, come back (and show fdisk output).
