I replaced the whole head.S with old prep one. Works, so head.S is
probably the culprit.
1. L1 cache disabling was moved. I moved it back to before cheking OF
address (but after recording link register into r3 since I left the
disabling a subroutine), it still hangs.
2. The address that the code is relocated to is computed differently.
Old code relocates itself to hardcoded 8M (start), new code to
max(load+size, end).
3. Relocation loop is different (see ms to be memmove, not memcpy, at
the first glance).
I replaced the calculation and relocate with old unconditional relocate,
it still hangs.
Replaced head.S with first half of old head.S (relocate from old,
start_ldr from new), still hangs.
Put a couple of debugging traps around. Trap before load_kernel is
executed, trap after load_kernel is never reached. So head.S changes
cause load_kernel to hang.
Some more changes and the only difference is load_kernel vs
decompress_kernel. Changing load_kernel call in relocate.S to
decompress_kernel makes the kernel boot. Oh, finally.
BTW, the address of OF residual data bounces around in
r3->r29->r4->r11->r6. The old code only did r3->r11->r6 but the new code
uses r11 for cache disabling.
This is the patch I'm using currently. I understand that this is
probably not the right patch for inclusion :)
