Hi Jeff,
Well you have device drivers like the symbios scsi driver for instance that
tries to determine if it's seen a card before. It does this by looking at the
bus,dev etc numbers...  It's quite reasonable for two different scsi cards to be
on the same bus number, same dev number etc yet they are in different PCI
domains.
Is this a device driver bug or feature?

Right, one could do that and then all the large machine architectures would have
their own implementation for the same problem. That's not necessarily a bad
thing, but some commonality I think would be a good thing.
