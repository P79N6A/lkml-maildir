   The thing is, that in fact kernel optimization is not that important.
   The goal of kernel is to provide framework for applications to the 
job well. I wasn't doing any kernels measurements - since kernel docs 
are saying that -O2 is the standard. And it is really hard to measure 
kernel only perfomance. (And it is rather pointless - I'm not going to 
sell linux kernel ;-)))
   But indeed I was testing my application on embedded system with 16K 
L1 cache. Results were pretty predictable: gcc 2.95.3 + -Os was giving 
some (around 2-3%) performance improvements, while 2.95.3 + -O[23] and 
3.2.3 with any optimization were giving aprox. the same times. (App is 
bloated with third-party libraries, C++ and threads. Save God I have 
killed all exceptions - they were really really really slow on target 
system.)
   But on other side - since embedded systems are not that overclocked 
as high-end toys - cache miss is not that painful. As of docs, NatSemi 
Geode@266MHz cache miss costs exactly 266/66 == 4 cycles.
