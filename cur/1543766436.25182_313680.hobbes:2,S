Actually, the most telling difference here is with the random read rates
which shows up to 1000% difference. I seriously doubt that has much to
do with lock contention (given that the sequential reads show 20% as you
said).
Could you once again have a look at the retransmission rates (both UDP
and TCP), comparing the SMP and UP cases?
Cheers,
