Dumb question? Has anybody actually tested "__builtin_expect", and
friends to see if any of this "coloration" actually enhances performance?
"unlikely()" is the negative of the new built-in. I would guess that
any conversion operations are going to negate any advantage possibly
gained by reordering instructions.
For instance:
		Given:
		if(a == b)
                   foo();
                else
                   bar();
... and ...
		if(unlikely(a == b))
                    foo();
                else
                    bar();
I would guess that the compiler output might be:
		movl a(%esp), %eax	# Get 'a' off the stack
		cmpl b(%esp), %eax	# Compare against 'b' on the stack
		jnz	1f		# Not the same
		call	foo		# Are the same, call foo()
		jmp	2f		# Need to jump around stuff
	1:	call	bar		# Execute bar()
	2:	# Do more stuff.
Note that no matter what you do, comparing equal or not equal,
when you get down to the actual code, it's apples and apples.
You are always going to take an extra jump in one execution
path after the function, and you will take a conditional jump
before the function call in the other execution path. So, you
always have the "extra" jumps, no matter.
I would guess that most all of the conditional code will turn
out this way and, won't even be as efficient as what I have
written above.
Before a lot of readable code is modified (trashed???), maybe
somebody should benchmark the differences? The tests I have
made here, seem to show that any measurment differences are
in the noise and... favor leaving __builtin_expect() out of
the code.
Cheers,
