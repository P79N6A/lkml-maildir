If you don't create a file with the same name as the directory, and set
it to inherit the body of the files in the directory, and modify all of
the files to inherit the stat data of the directory (I'll not specify
how inheritance gets turned on, I need to think about several
alternatives some more, I like the loic@ceic.com /fscontrol idea
though...), and you don't read/write to files that begin with ".." in the
filename without first creating them (creating a file with the same name
as the filter overrides the filter), then you remain blissfully unaware
of these changes.  You are welcome to suggest a better prefix than ".."
for me to give special meaning to it.
Did you really think I would make it somehow mandatory?  No wonder you
guys were in a tizzy....
