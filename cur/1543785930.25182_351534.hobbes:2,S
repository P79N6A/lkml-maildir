Have fun patching almost every text processing tool and concept out
there.
Apart from that the way of that marker is wrong it seems to me that the
UTF-8 body has no other choice than such a insane "rule" or
recommendation).

No one said all text files are scripts, instead it is the other way
'round.

The question was: What is if this marker in encountered within a file?
To be ignored (by UTF-8 aware tools)? Some other interpretation?

Which is again not true since lots of tools out there printed ISO-8859-*
correctly before UTF-8 was deployed.
