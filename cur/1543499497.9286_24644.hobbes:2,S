phhttpd.

Apache 2.0 should be.
BTW: the big issue with khttpd is a lack of genericness. Its a single problem
single solution piece of code. There are lots and lots of equivalent problems
and they all boil own to the same thing.
Forget khttpd. Throw most of it away. Now implement asynchronous sendfile. This
is quite doable.
There are two ways to tackle it.
#1 You allow the issuing of page cache read requests from bh handlers. Elegant,
fast and truely horrible to do right
or
#2 You have a single kernel thread that takes a queue of page requests and
basically grabs stuff whenever it is wanted (kslurpd)
With these pages being drawn into memory you can move the socket sendfile
state machine loop into the sock->data_ready() callback so that the application
becomes
	while(1)
	{
		wait accept|sigio+siginfo
		if(accept)
		{
			accept
			set O_NDELAY|FASYNC
			async_sendfile(....)
		}
		if(sigio)
		{
			close(fd);
		}
	}
An async sendfile solves the thread scaling problem , solves the 'do I feed
this request to the kernel' problem, solves the HTTP 1.1 persistence problem,
and works for ftp, finger, gopher... etc
