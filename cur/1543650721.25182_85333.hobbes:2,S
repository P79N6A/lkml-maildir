I second this!
I would very very much like to purge my systems of SUID root binaries. 
If this goes in, we/I should start a little project to audit the SUID
root binaries commonly found on Linux to see what are the minimum
capabilities each binary needs.
Ideally the distro then ship this way by default.
RPM/DPKG (tar,cpio?) should be modified to store the capabilities too.
