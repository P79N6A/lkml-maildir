I see, I didn't know that the MD's raid5 did this.

When I've had an unclean shutdown on one of my systems (10x 50gb raid5) it's
always slowed the system down when booting up.  Quite significantly I must
say.  I wait until I can login and change the rebuild max speed to slow it
down while I'm using it.   But that is another thing.
Thanks for the clarification on raid5.
