Well - let's see. I want to blackmail my friends so I want computer
that acts as phone, except that I want my voice to sound like
mickey-mouse.
That should be easily doable with winmodem, but I guess you can not do
it with any other modem. And: you don't have to live with ugly AT

So it is not "ripoff" only.
