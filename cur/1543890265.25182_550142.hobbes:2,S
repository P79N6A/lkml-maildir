As Luca pointed, if we add conversion for one driver, we should add for
the rest. 
Instead, it would be better if Jiri sends the decoding and the rescaling
stuff as a patch to v4l2-apps/lib, starting the API decoding library.
Once we have a library, we can ask the userspace developers to use it
for the formats not recognized by their userspace apps.
Cheers,
Mauro
