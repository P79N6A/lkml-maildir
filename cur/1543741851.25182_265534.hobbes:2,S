I'm personally of the opinion that using the BTE to "speculatively" clear
hugetlb pages in advance of when the hugetlb pages are requested is not a good
thing [tm].  One never knows if those pages will ever be requested.  And in
the meantime, tasks that need the BTE will be delayed by speculative use.
But that is a personal bias  :-), with no data to back it up.
AFAIK, it is faster to clear the page with the processor anyway, since the
processor has a faster clock cycle.  Yes, it destroys the processor cache,
but the application has clearly indicated that it wants the page NOW, please,
(because it has faulted on it), and delivering the page to the application
as quickly as possible sounds like a good thing.  I'm not sure reloading
the processor cache at this point is a cost we care about, given that the
application is likely just starting up anyway.  I figure hugetlb pages are
allocated once, stay around a long long time, so I'm not sure optimizing to
minimize cache damage is the correct way to go here.
The only obvious win is for memory only nodes, that have a BTE and no CPU.
It is probably faster to use the local BTE than a remote CPU to clear the page.
Does that make any sense?
