This is not quite the argument. With that argument, 16 bit would be
fine. And even then, I'd call you guilty of causing my lights to flicker
;-)
The argument about UUIDs goes a bit beyond that: No admin needed to
assign them; they can stay the same even if clusters/clusters merge (in
theory); they can be used for inter-cluster addressing too, because they
aren't just unique within a single cluster (think clusters of clusters,
grids etc, whatever the topology), and finally, UUID is a big enough
blob to put all other identifiers in, be it a two bit node id, a
nodename, 32bit IPv4 address or a 128bit IPv6.
This piece is important. It defines one of the fundamental objects in
the API.
I recommend you read up on the discussions on the OCF list on this; this
has probably been one of the hottest arguments.

This still doesn't answer the question. You're telling me how I get my
address in AF_CLUSTER. I was asking, again: "How is the kernel component
configured which paths/IP to use" - ie, the equivalent of ifconfig/route
for the cluster stack, if you so please.
Doing this in a wrapper is one answer - in which case we'd have a
consistent user-space API provided by shared libraries wrapping a
specific kernel component. This places the boundary in user-space.
This seems to be a main point of contention, also applicable to the
first question about node identifiers: What does the kernel/user-space
boundary look like, and is this the one we are aiming to clarify?
Or do we place the boundary in user-space with a specific wrapper around
a given kernel solution.
I can see both or even a mix, but it's an important question.

That partial sentence already makes no sense. So how does the kernel
(DLM in this case) learn about whether a node is assumed to be up or
down if the membership is in user-space? Right! User-space must tell
it.
Again, this is sort of the question of where the API boundary between
published/internal is.
For example, with OCFS2 (w/user-space membership, which it doesn't yet
have, but which they keep telling me is trivial to add, but we're
busying them with other work right now ;-) it is supposed to work like
this: When a membership event occurs, user-space transfers this event
to the kernel by writing to a configfs mount.
Likewise, the node ids and comm links the kernel DLM uses with OCFS2
are configured via that interface.
If we could standarize at the kernel/user-space boundary for clustering,
like we do for syscalls, this would IMHO be cleaner than having
user-space wrappers.

Any API can be mapped to any other API. That wasn't the question. I was
aiming at the kernel/user-space boundary again.

Passing a socket in to use for communication makes sense. "I want you to
use this transport when talking to the cluster". However, that begs the
question whether you're passing in a unicast peer-to-peer socket or a
multicast one which reaches all of the nodes, and what kind of
security, ordering, and reliability guarantees that transport needs to
provide.
Again, this is (from my side) about understanding the user-space/kernel
boundary, and the APIs used within the kernel.

Reading patches is fine for understanding syntax, and spotting some
nits. I find actual discussion with the developers to be invaluable to
figure out the semantics and the _intention_ of the code, which takes
much longer to deduce from the code alone; and you know, just sometimes
the code doesn't actually reflect the intentions of the programmers who
wrote it ;-)
