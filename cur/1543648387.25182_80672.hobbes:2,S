   I'm not sure that's an option :
   o userspace needs to know the size of the cookie in the event buffer
   o userspace would like to use the cookie as a hash value to avoid
     repeated lookups
   Perhaps the best solution would be to use a separate u32 ID value,
   allocated linearly. I could just refuse to allocate new dcookies in
   theoretical case of overflow.
   The other possibility is a dcookiefs (cat
   /dev/oprofile/dcookie/34343234) but that's a lot of extra
   code/complexity ...
I don't understand why using a bigger type is not an option.
Why not just use u64?  That would work too.
