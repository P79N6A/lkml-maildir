Of course I know that.  I'm not the one making those arguments.
And then, not all of those pieces of code are indeed moficiations of
GPLv2-covered code, so your objection is off target.

YES!  Thank you!  This is exactly the point I'm trying to make.
Now can you please explain this to Linus in terms that his brain won't
dismiss as "coming from a fundamentalist"?

No, seriously.  Linus is disputing the equation above, dismissing my
various attempts to show it to him, whenever it appears in teh context
of tivoization, apparently because it doesn't match his moral belief
that tivoization ought to be permitted on his moral grounds.

You've helped me a lot while at that.  Thanks!
I hope this helps others fundamentalist anti-fundamentalists :-) see
