I'm running LVM2 on 2.4.21-ac4, and that works just fine for me (debian 
sid, with the lvm2 package from the distribution). While 2.5/6 is still 
too unstable for me to use for long (for unrelated reasons) , it does 
boot up correctly and function with 25 lvm2 partitions on four different 
lvm groups. I would get it working correctly on your 2.4 kernel first. 
There were not magic incantations for me...what distribution are you 
using, and where are you getting LVM2 from?
