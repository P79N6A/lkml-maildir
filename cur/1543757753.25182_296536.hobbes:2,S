with that attitude it's never gonna happen.  I work almost exclusively
on X, but once we get at least one sample driver done (probably
radeon, I would be more than happy to devote my limited development
resources to the new drm/fb super driver.  Right now the kernel FB
drivers have no benefit for me so I don't use/develop them.  The drm
just works and I'm more interested in the crtc/modes/outputs handling
than the command processor control stuff.  I think a lot of X
developers (and porobably IHVs) will get on board when this happens. 
X is undermanned as well, but we've managed to do a pretty good job of
supported a lot of features on a fair number of cards.
