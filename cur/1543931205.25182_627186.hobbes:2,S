The last number on the "th" line in /proc/net/rpc/nfsd should tell you
how many seconds all threads have been busy (and previous lines tell you
how much time they've been 90% busy, etc).  That seems like sufficient
information at least for a rough guess.  It wouldn't allow as fast a
response time, but perhaps that doesn't matter.

Ideally you'd like to limit the number of threads that that can happen
to, so that we still have a few threads free to handle rpc requests that
don't depend on some borked disk.  I don't know how to do that, though.

If that's enough configuration for everyone, then fine.  If we suspect
people might need to do something more complicated, that might be an
argument for trying to do the tuning in userspace until we figure out
exactly what knobs are needed.
