Subject: Monthly md check == hung machine; how do I debug?

I've got a machine with a 4 disk SATA raid10 configuration using md.
The entire disk is loop-AES encrypted, but that shouldn't matter
here.
Once a month, Debian runs:
    /usr/share/mdadm/checkarray --cron --all --quiet
and the machine hangs within 30 minutes of that starting.
It seems that I can avoid the hang by not having "mdadm --monitor"
running, but I'm not certain if that's the case or if I've just been
lucky this go-round.
I'm on kernel 2.6.23.1, my own compile thereof, x86_64, AMD
Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3700+.
I've looked through all the 2.6.23 and 2.6.24 Changelogs, and I
can't find anything that looks relevant.
So, how can I (help you all) debug this?
-Robin
