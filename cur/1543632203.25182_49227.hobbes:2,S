   What was the idea when writing the code that zeroes memory? It seems
   so useless.
   
Because 9 out of 10 drivers where I had to change virt_to_bus
into the portable pci_alloc_consistent were using get_free_pages()
which zeros things out for you.
I do actually remember that many of those instances in fact did
depend on the memory being zero'd for them, they weren't using the
"zero the pages too" variant instead of __get_free_pages()
gratuitously.
