the picture gets even murkier when you consider that even if neither 
option overflows the cpu cache the one that takes more space in the cache 
leaves less space in the cache for the userspacde code that the system is 
actually there to run.

what can be done to find the horribly bad but small code among the "it's 
smaller and would be less efficiant if you didn't consider the cache" 
majority?
