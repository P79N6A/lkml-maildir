... and SUS2 doesn't mention names ending with "." as a possible reason
for failure. Weird. Anyway, I think that (a) no matter which policy we
will take it should be done in VFS (*not* in filesystems - see your
example with lofs) and (b) we may need a generic mechanism for dealing
with such stuff.
	What about adding a boolean vector to the struct task and adding a
new syscall:
int POSIX_lossage(struct lossageset_t *new, struct lossageset_t *old);
with semantics a-la sigprocmask(2) (and maybe some way to determine
whether the thing will be inherited over exec() or not)? Maybe it would be
reasonable to make it available via /proc/<pid>/current_lossage too.
On the kernel side it would mean adding int losing(int kind_of_lossage);
modelled after capable() and protecting the losing checks in VFS with
if (losing(LOSSAGE_FOO)) {
	/* do losing things */
}
s/lossage/features/ if you want political correctness. I really think
that such mechanism might be useful. Comments?
