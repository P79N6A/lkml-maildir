Yes, what you do is nice, but generates much code. What about
this for pushfl:
pushfl
push %eax
pushfl
pop %eax
orb $(1<<1),%ah  /* same as orl $(1<<9),%eax */
testl $(1<<19),%eax
jnz 69001f
andb $~(1<<1),%ah /* same as andl $~(1<<9),%eax */
69001:
mov %eax,4(%esp)
pop %eax
? This saves 6 bytes, which is a 20% code reduction ;-)
