IOCCC entry candidate.
Simple. !!__builtin_types_compatible_p, as it sounds, will return 1 if
both types are compatible. If they are, then '1-2*!!_builtin..' will
produce -1, then - surprisingly - sizeof(typeof(int[-1])) seems strange to
me and should throw the error.
If the types are not compatible, compat_p returns 0. !! will turn it into
0. 2* will turn it into 0. 1-0 is 1. sizeof(typeof(int[1])) is valid, and
*0 will compile it away.
So in case they _ARE_ compatible, we get the compile error, as far as I
can see it. There's a ! too much in the !!_builtin line. Now we know why
such patches are dangerous.
What's more, a test program does not even fail when the types are
incompatible. (Or it's also wrong):
#include <stdio.h>
struct foo {
        int x, y, z;
};
struct bar {
        const char *fol;
};
#define c(x, y)  \
        sizeof(typeof(int[1 - \
         2*!!__builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof(x), typeof(y))]))
int main(void)
{
        printf("%d\n", c(struct foo *, struct bar *));
	printf("%d\n", c(int*, int*));
}
Both printf()s throw a compile time error.
