You may want to examine /proc/meminfo, /proc/slabinfo, and the output
of sysrq-m.
mm/vmscan.c (kswapd) is responsible for freeing most memory.  The
routine you are probably most interested in is shrink_cache.
I would check to make sure that the pages in the icache are backed by
a mapping and if so, that they are clean.   If either of those two
conditions are not met, then the page cannot be thrown away.
