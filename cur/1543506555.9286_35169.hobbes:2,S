  Hello.
  I'm sorry that I'm not reacting  on your mails (if any) but server with my mail
is currently unreachable :-(.
  I've done a few changes in new quota code:
  * fixed bug with statistics
  * free_blk() now doesn't move last block over deleted block. I decided that the space
    we gain isn't wort problems with changing blocks we already have read in some buffers.
    So now there's a list of free blocks...
  * default settings for grace times was removed from linux/quota.h as it's not kernel thing
    anymore
I also tested quota code - tests like
  * set quota for 512 users, delete random 256 users (all with hashtable sized 256) for 20 times
  * set quota for 7000 users, delete random 5000 users
  * set quota for 12000 users, delete random 10000 users
Quota file seemed well after all tests but there's probably some memory leak as after adding
12000 users my machine (64 MB ram) started swapping (it was ~10MB in swap) and the number
of swapped memory slowly increased when I was doing something with quota...
I also changed utilities a bit:
  * creating of new quota files was moved from convertquota to quotacheck (it was this way before,
    it makes more sense and quotacheck will be needed instantly but convertquota is just for
    transition period)
  * old manpages were updated to reflect changes in utilities
The new stuff should be available as soon as connection to school server will work.
								Honza.
