   This is nothing to do the the kernel. It's to do with C.
   Yes, it is dangerous to allow this behaviour. However, C doesn't
perform bounds checking on arrays -- this is left to the programmer to
ensure that an array is never accessed outside its bounds. The effects
of accessing (reading or writing) an array outside its bounds are
undefined. In this case, it's worked. In other situations, with
different arrays, it may not work.
   Nothing to see here. Move along.
   Hugo.
