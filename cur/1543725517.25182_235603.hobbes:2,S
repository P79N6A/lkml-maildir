Users have had the 6-12 month warning about devfs for a while now :)
And udev is currently available in the latest distro versions of:
	- Red Hat
	- SuSE
	- Gentoo
	- Debian
	- Mandrake
While devfs is only supported in Gentoo at this time (and udev fills
that support issue for those users.)

Ok, if people think that would really change anything, I'll wait a year.
I'm patient :)
