Absolutely.  Why do we need wrappers when we can offline entire nodes
with 6-line shell scripts?  The CPU hotplug interfaces are here today
and the memory stuff will be here soon.  Perhaps you could help with the
NUMA part.
#!/bin/sh
NODENUM=$1
NODEDIR=/sys/devices/system/node/node${NODENUM}
for i in $NODEDIR/cpu* $NODEDIR/memory*; do
	echo 0 > $i/control/online
fi
echo 0 > $NODEDIR/control/online
We don't currently export bus to node mappings in sysfs, but we have
them in the kernel, so that won't be too hard to export as well.
