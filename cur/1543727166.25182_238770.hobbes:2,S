Maybe we can introduce something like 3.5GB patch like 2.4-aa and 2.4-wolk 
has? For reference: 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.23aa3/00_3.5G-address-space-5
Let me know and I'll cook up a 2.6 version.
Grmpf, that reminds me of my Documentation cleanup patches ;(
