Is the 0xf00 id the only one you get? If it is a SuperIO chip then 
resetting it will probably cause all sorts of funky problems.
Do you know what SuperIO is used in the machine? And have you tried 
confirming that the card reader is indeed winbond? The easiest way to do 
that is to see if the Windows driver is wbsd.sys.
The documentation was given to me by one of Winbond's resellers (after a 
lot of begging and whining). It only includes documentation for one chip 
and the ID specified in it is not even the same as reported by the chip 
the spec is supposed to be for. Winbond is definitely not on my 
recommended vendors list.
