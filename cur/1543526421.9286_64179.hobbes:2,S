I'd rather have a kernel that can easily bring up a full system, if it's
not too much bother, and if it doesn't cause ugly design issues (ie it's
ok to have _local_ ugliness that doesn't spread to be a global mess, and I
think local ugliness is worth it if it means that you don't need tons of
infrastructure).
Everybody always points to initrd, and it's wonderful for the generic
case, but let's face it - it's not very simple and convenient.
