	I give one person $2,000 and one person $50,000 to buy a car. Would you 
argue that they are equally likely to come back with quality cars?

	Now you're changing the argument on me. First we were talking about code 
quailty and financial compensation. Now we're talking about code quality and 
cost. The two are really not related. A person can produce a product that is 
free either with or without being paid.

	Yes, but who will that person be and how many of them will there be? That 
will depend upon how much money is available. Some people will do wonderful 
work for free, and if you have no money, those are the only people you can 
use and you get as much time as they can spare or afford to give at best. If 
you have money, you can still use those people, but you can also use people 
who need money.

	This is exactly the point. A given programmer may not create better code 
with greater compensation. However, a programming project can create better 
code with greater compensation. (Assuming we don't randomly pick projects and 
dump money on them, of course. Assuming the money is at least placed by the 
people who went to the trouble of earning it choosing where they think it 
will do the most good.)
