Guess I'll have to try running 2.6.24-rc2-mm1 on my own system.  In the 
meantime, you can try adding some printk statements to 
drivers/base/power/main.c.  In particular, see whether 
lock_all_devices() gets called from device_suspend(), whether it 
returns, and how far dpm_suspend() manages to get.
