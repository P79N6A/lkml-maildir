Presumably only if the execute bits are set.

The binfmt_misc module pretty much does this already.

The resource fork contains multiple resources, each with a four byte
identifier code followed by an arbitrary number of bytes. Two of the
resources are the CREATOR (4 bytes) and TYPE fields (4 bytes). Every
CREATOR/TYPE field is unique, with Apple as the central registration
authority for all CREATOR fields (to prevent collisions).
For example, Microsoft Word documents are MSWD/WDBN. Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets are XCEL/XLS4. Microsoft Excel Macros are XCEL/XLM4.
Apple achieves all this by fiddling the filesystem (forked files and
some ugly format for the resource fork) and using their iron fist to
keep application developers in line. However it's not necessary (you
only access files through the GUI, so the filesystem could have been
stock standard UFS with two UFS files per "user" file).
KDE and GNOME are doing something similar, only their resource forks
are far more elegant (human readable, no forked filesystem).
