When (if) CCP goes down, pppd shuts down LCP if MPPE was running.  This
could move into the kernel if you think it's better that way, but I think
userland is ok.
static void
ccp_input(unit, p, len)
{
...
#ifdef MPPE
        if (ccp_gotoptions[unit].mppe) {
            error("MPPE disabled, closing LCP");
            lcp_close(unit, "MPPE disabled by peer");
        }
#endif
}
