Subject: take3: Updated CPU Hotplug patches for IA64 (pj blessed) Patch [1/7]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew/David
Here are the next set of patches for supporting CPU hotplug. This is
officially Paul Jackson (pj@sgi.com) blessed for cpumask related issues
the earlier patch introduced. Hopefully ready for David-MT to wave the 
magic wand (blessing) for inclusion in ia64 tree :-)
Thanks to akpm for providing a test base for comments and improve the 
overall acceptability of the patch.
Due to the changes, i had to change the series (patch order) so i had generic 
changes or bug fixes before hotplug ia64.
The real changes in this patch set are really changes to cpu_present.patch.
- Removed ARCH_HAS_CPU_PRESENT_MAP
- No confusing ifdef's around for aliasing with/without hotplug for cpu_present
  and cpu_possible_map
- cpu_present_map is now declared for all architectures, and managed
  transparently for arch's that dont populate those to work seamlessly.
- Tested for hotlug on tiger4 (logical, not physical remove using echo 0 to the
  cpu control file in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/online).
- pj tested boot on SN2. (thanks for testing and a fix for booting, integrated 
  in this patch)
Name: core_kernel_init.patch
Author: Ashok Raj (Intel Corporation)
D: This patch changes __init to __devinit to init_idle so that when a new cpu
D: arrives, it can call these functions at a later time.
