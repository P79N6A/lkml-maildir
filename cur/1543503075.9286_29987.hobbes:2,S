I asked a lawyer, a real authentic qualified lawyer. Thats one of the first
points we realised the GPL v BSD advertising clause ssue
I dont think the rest justifies a response.
AFAIK Linux 2.0.x (x<36 or so) has only one actual tcp protocol violation
that was fixed about 2.0.36. Thats an obscure rule about reserved bits always
being set to zero that can only be triggered by the other end violating the
spec (legitimately if running some experimental research work).
