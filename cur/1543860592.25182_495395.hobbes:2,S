There's a problem with defining cache coherency macros to that extent.
You take away flexibility to efficiently implement them on various
platforms which you didn't think about (eg, in the above case it's
perfectly fine for VIVT, but not really VIPT.)

It has the significant advantage that, unlike the flush* calls, they
can't really be forgotten by folk programming on cache alias-free
hardware.  That's a _very_ persuasive argument for this proposed
interface.
