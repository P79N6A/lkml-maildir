It got worse ;)
(note: I can;t get dma to work; see below)
# hdparm -X69 -d1 -u1 -c1 -m16 /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 setting 32-bit I/O support flag to 1
 setting multcount to 16
 setting unmaskirq to 1 (on)
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)

 setting xfermode to 69 (UltraDMA mode5)
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
[root@lal root]# hdparm  -Tt /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
