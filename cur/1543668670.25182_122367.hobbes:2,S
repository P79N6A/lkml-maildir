The FastTrack cards are identical to the UltraDMA cards from promise -
you can turn one into the other with a resistor and a firmware flash.

Makes perfect sense - he's getting 50M/s to each channel, but it's split
over two drives, so drive throughput is about halved.

Absolutely correct - you should *never* run IDE RAID on a channel that
has both a master and slave.  When one disk on an IDE channel has an
error, the whole channel is reset - this makes both disks inaccessible,
and RAID5 now has two failed disks => you data is gone!  *ALWAYS* use
separate IDE channels.
