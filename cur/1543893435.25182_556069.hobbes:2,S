No offense, but this is an ugly hack. What if sizeof(int) != 
sizeof(long)? You're calling glibc functions with that fd as a 
parameter. On some arches, compiling will issue warnings or simply fail.
An alternative would be to use kmalloc instead of a global static 
variable. Do you like this one more?
