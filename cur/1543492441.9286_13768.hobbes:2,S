Hello all,
    The kernel crapped out today... Here's the numbers
v2.2.4, Debian v2.1.  The ksymoops program did not compile on any of 
my machines (no bfd.h?), but the nm of vmlinux showed [c0149b60] 
proc_readfd as the closest.  gdb on vmlinux said [c0149c6b] 
<proc_readfd+267>: cmpl $0x0,0x8(%edx) .
The messages poped up Apr 8 12:10:07 after a reboot (not sure 
how long after).
    The kern.log goes to the line CPU:  0 and stops. Did the kernel 
take down the machine before it had a chance to log the error? 
    If this post should be directed to somewhere else please tell me, 
I couldn't find anybody who looked approiate in the MAINTAINERS file, 
and didn't want to email Linus directly if this isn't a big thing.
