Yes.  I am removing the file in these cases.  So that part sounds like
it's there.

A single directory file per volume (like an inode table, except mine can
grow dynamically), and the file is viewed as a sequential list of 128
byte records numbered 0...n.  Files and Subdirs are identical in terms
of how they are layed out.  Each 128 byte record has a unique number and
contains a parent link back to it's directory.  '0' is assumed to be the
root volume directory and all other directories in NWFS use the record
number of the relative position of a particular 128 byte record in the
volume directory file as the directory number.

Each "root" namespace record has a fat chain head or suballocation index
to indentify where the fat or suballoc chain starts for the data storage
for a file.  Subdirs do not have a fat chain head in the directory
file.  A "file" in NWFS can be a linked list of directory records with
the "root" record holding the file data fork.  If a MAC namespace is
present, the MAC record in this chain may also contain a fat chain head
in it's directory record.

It sounds like inode numbers are arbitrary, and so long as I have cached
a hash structure in the inode (which I do), I can just make up inode
numbers for files (provided they are unique), and use the
inode->generic_ip pointer to access the actual directory number.
Is this correct?
