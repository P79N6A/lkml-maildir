Yes, in the signed/unsigned case the comparison generated is always
unsigned.  This is something that all c programmers are supposed to have 
tattoed on the insides of their eyelids, because if you don't know it
there are all kinds of situations that can bite you, not just min and
max.

The narrower is expanded to the size of the wider before being compared.

No, these cases are defined perfectly clearly and have been at least
since K&R.
