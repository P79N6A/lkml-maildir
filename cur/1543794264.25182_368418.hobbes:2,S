In particular check the version requirements for udev - you need to be
on a version greater than or equal to 71. Sarge/stable has a really
old version. In particular I am running unstable as I had too many
funny errors (including this one) - but etch should be fine.
If running another distribution check this also as it is a real requirement.
To find the latest version of udev required check Documentation/Changes
