With matroxfb (and dozen of other fbdevs) currcon can be -1 (with matroxfb
currcon can be even -2 during probe, so con != info->currcon tests always
fail...) when there is no VT attached to the fbdev. That's why matroxfb
uses my_install_cmap instead of generic one.
It should be no issue in 2.5.54 though, as there is no install_cmap 
anymore...
