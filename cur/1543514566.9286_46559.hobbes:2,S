     I didn't notice this behavior before 2.2.13, though I can't say for sure
that it didn't exist...
     But if I export a file systemnfs read only on one machine, and then
attempt to nfs mount it read write on another machine, instead of only denying
read/write access, nfsd dies on the machine the file system is mounted from. 
     It dies without any OOPS message or other clue, even on single CPU
machines. 
     Granted, trying to nfs mount a file system that is exported read-only as
read-write is an operator error, but the server should handle that more
gracefully and not die.
