I think so, yes. We'd be able to fix kernelspace bugs in it, for
starters.

They'd certainly be closer in that userspace code is significantly
easier to emulate and/or reverse engineer.

If the userspace portion is using a standard API and not just using
the driver to open gaping holes in the kernel/user barrier, I see it
as a step forward.
