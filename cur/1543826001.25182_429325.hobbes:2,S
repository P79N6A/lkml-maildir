firstly, i'd suggest to use another magic value for 'bottom of call 
stacks' - it is way too common to jump or call a NULL pointer. Something 
like 0xfedcba9876543210 would be better.

for the RIP/EIP to get corrupted is a common occurance. So is stack 
corruption. So the fallback mechanism shouldnt be a 'short while' 
side-thought, it must be part of the design.
If we use a much better magic value to delimit the stack then our 
confidence that the stacktrace is correct will be much higher.
In all other cases (if we go outside of the stack page(s)) we _must_ 
fall back to the dump 'scan the stack pages for interesting entries' 
method, to get the information out! "Uh oh the unwind info somehow got 
corrupted, sorry" is not enough to debug a kernel bug.
What we _can_ ignore are stack/register corruptions that accidentally 
cause a valid unwind call chain to be printed. That is impossible to 
detect and it's much less likely than say normal stack or register 
corruption. But we _must not_ ignore clear parsing errors. This is a 
really basic thing ...
