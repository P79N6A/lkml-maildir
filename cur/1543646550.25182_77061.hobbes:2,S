They won't have any effect on the system, but the load number is
insane (we have a 2 CPU intel-boks with a load number of 480)
and there's like 200-300 (or more) processes hanging in D-state
with they're FD's and stuff. There _really_ should be a way
to remove all theese processes, Solaris does this nicely.
