	Also consider using Andrew Tridgell's 
	dbench/tbench/smbtorture suite in this process: it
	is mathmeatically comparable to NetBench, runs on
	smaller numbers of load-generationg machines, and
	can give better breakdowns into the disk component,
	then network component and the on-server component
	of the available performance.
	I also have some results from SPARC Linux: send me email.
