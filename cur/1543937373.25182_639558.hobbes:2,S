So what would I have to do to find out the real amount of memory free?
Would that be the MemFree field in /proc/meminfo plus, from
/proc/slabinfo, *_cache and size-*?
If that's the case it would seem to be somewhat of a pain to get and
kind of out of left field as I'd say most people would expect MemFree to
indicate the amount of memory that's no longer freely available
(ignoring swapping it out for simplicities sake).
I'm wondering as I'm trying to monitor this stuff and I've just found
out that the easily accessible values are not as useful as I previously
thought.
