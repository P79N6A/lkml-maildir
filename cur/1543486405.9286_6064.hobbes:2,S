It's fixed thanks to Andrzej Krzysztofowicz who gave me the following advice:
	I suggest to try -b2048
	If it is problem caused by memory fragmentation it should help.
	However I don't know mke2fs source code enough to be absolutely sure
I tried this block size and it worked like a charm.
Thanks for the help people
