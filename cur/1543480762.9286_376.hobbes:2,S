[SNIPPED all the rest]
Wrong. The same machine, with a windows 98 CD is functioning within
30 minutes. It is done at least twice per week here at work by
technicians who don't know an operating system from a hole in the ground.
You are being myopic. Step back and see what the rest of the world is
doing. If you want some special configuration, i.e., Windows and
another OS, you have problems that require the help of experience,
either by obtaining that experience from doing it over and over again
until you get it right, or by getting the help from someone experienced
like yourself.
The basic Windows installation takes 30 minutes (if your hard disk is
not too slow) and is ready to connect to an Internet provider.
This does not mean that Windows is any good. It just means that it
installs easily. Now, it is possible to have a powerful installation
program that learns about the hardware that would install Linux
with no human intervention at all. In fact, the default configuration
could have one of those "harmless" never to be routed IP addresses and
even a default machine name.
It does no good to claim that it isn't important. It is important
enough so that Distributors that plan to remain in business will
be adding value to their distribution by designing such an installation
program. Otherwise Linux will just remain a fad for college students
that can't afford Suns.
The `quick installation` instructions would tell a user how to
customize his machine (IP address, machine name, domain name, etc.).
The machine is already running in a distributor-defined configuration
before any such customization takes place.
The major bottleneck is the X-Windows installation. However, powerful
programs which are executed as part of the installation procedure
can find the correct server and configure the machine. Monitors even
'tell` the input if it's synchronizing properly so a powerful program
can even determine if the user's monitor is able to handle 1280x1024
or if it's got to be left at 1024x768, etc,.. The windows installation
always gets the screen right. 
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
                 ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****
Penguin : Linux version 2.1.131 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
Warning : It's hard to remain at the trailing edge of technology.
Wisdom  : It's not a Y2K problem. It's a Y2Day problem.
