Make it async.  So anyone can review stuff and record their feelings in a
centralized place.  We have a spare machine set up, kernel.bkbits.net, 
that could be used as a dumping grounds for patches and reviews if
master.kernel.org is too locked down.
If you force the review process into a "push" model where patches are 
sent to someone, then you are stuck waiting for them to review it and
it may or may not happen.  Do the reviews in a centralized place where
everyone can see them and add their own comments.
