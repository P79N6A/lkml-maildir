Are you sure? I don't see why the shared read can't be speculatively done
before the lock read+write. The memory ordering rules _do_ say that reads
can pass writes and correctness is only guaranteed when the write is to
the same location _on the same processor_. I don't see anything that
suggests a write on CPU 1 throws out a speculative read result on CPU 2.
Unless there's new snooping magic on PIIs and above.
So, theoretically (though not likely in practice!), shared can be
speculatively read by CPU 2, written by CPU 1, and then the lock can be
freed by CPU 1 and grabbed by CPU 2. All writes are still observed in
order, but there's still a potential race.

Here's what my PPro manual has to say in the Multiple Processor
Management section:
  Locked operations are serializing. They wait for all previous
  instructions to complete. Locked operations are atomic with respect
  to all other memory operations and all externally visible
  events. Only instruction fetch and page table accesses can pass
  locked instructions.
Combined with my interpretation of the read/write ordering rules,
serializing for LOCK is the right thing to do - LOCK is primarily useful
for synchronizing data between processors.
At any rate, the LOCK is required for atomicity. And if either of us is
right about ordering and serialization, the current spin_lock does the
right thing.
