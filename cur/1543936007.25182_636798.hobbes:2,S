That would be great!  I can't speak for others but -mm poses a problem
for testing your patchset because it is so bleeding.  Let me know if
you take the plunge on a 2.6.23.x backport; I'd really appreciate it.
Is anyone else interested in consuming a 2.6.23.x backport of Rik's
patchset?  If so please speak up.
