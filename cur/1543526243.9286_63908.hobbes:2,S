It's a perfectly sane business decision. It takes up to 6-8 months to port
a new release of SAP R/3 to OS/390 or MVS. It takes some slight
modifications and a recompile to release it for Linux. Most of IBM's SAP
R/3 customers still use S/370's or S/390's, but IBM does the development
on AIX on RS/6000's. Now if they can tell their customers "Hey, here's a
free operating system that is far less complicated and more normal than
the one you use at the moment. It's for free, and it'll make you able to
use the next release of SAP R/3 six months earlier than if you stay with
MVS or S/390."
Guess why IBM did the port? I can imagine 3 reasons. Making money, making
publicity and making a nice hack (it didn't begin as an official
project, after all, but as a skunk-work.) I think it's a combination of
all three...
