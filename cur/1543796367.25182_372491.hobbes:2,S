Truly admiring your deep understanding of the real-time technology, I should remind you 
that within the real-time conditions almost each event may happen and may not happen, for 
instance, two calls from different context to the same funtion may happen at the same or 
almost the same time, and may not happen that way. Therefore I used the word "possible". 
Hope I clarified that a bit for you.
Please also see my previous emails for the explanation of how priority inversion can 
happen. This is not gonna be a rare case, BTW.
Vitaly
