In file include/linux/kd.h was declared KDKBDREP ioctl number
to tune up keyboard rate/delay with struct kbd_repeat.
But in 2.4.x kernel there is only m68k version for that.
I wrote some code for implement this feature on x86 machines.
Gzipped and uuencoded patch for kernel 2.4.5 is attached.
To setup keyboard rate/delay on x86 you should use code like that:
struct kbd_repeat kbd_rep={
       1000,      /* delay in ms */
       30         /* repeat rate in cps */
};
ioctl(0,KDKBDREP,&kbd_rep);
After that ioctl kbd_rep is filled with previous values.
I hope it will be useful for someone.[unhandled content-type:application/x-gzip]
