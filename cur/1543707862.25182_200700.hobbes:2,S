Jeff,
  can you push the attached patch directly to both 2.6.x and 2.4.x ?
It will exhibit an offset of 3 lines against 2.4.x but it works the same
on 2.4.x and on 2.6.x. The fix already exists in -mm/-netdev serie.
Daniel Egger <degger@fhm.edu> confirmed I did not manage to add a giant
typo in a 4 lines patch. When hit, this bug is more or less a killer.
Daniel, I have no clear idea for the performance issues. Actually I am more
concerned with the stability side of this driver, especially in the new,
shamelessly hacked, branch of the driver. I'll probably regenerate a set
of patches and spam^W reach the testers to have a new data point.

Assume tp->dirty_tx = NUM_TX_DESC/2, tp->cur_tx = NUM_TX_DESC - 1,
watch "entry" go beyond NUM_TX_DESC. This bug was copied from the 
(2.6.x only) sis190 driver where it is now fixed.
Stats are fixed as an extra bonus.
