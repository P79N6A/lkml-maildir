No, no snapshots. Just working find on a large dataset (source tree, 
about 16GB). The fun part is that I got the I/O errors for varying 
diretories and 'ls'-sing thes directories after find failed, too. 
However a follow-up tar to the ieee1394 disk to salvage the data 
actually could access all data correctly. One day before I did 
experience the same symptom but did reboot. This caused actual damage 
all over the place and I had to restore from the last checkpoint I made.
