Well, but those macbooks were really overheating, no? This seems like
sensor failure, because I do not think cpu had 128 Celsius, without
going through 100 Celsius, first.

I had fan working at the time of shutdown, and machine was able to
boot immediately afterwards. That means that 128 celsius was sensor
error.
