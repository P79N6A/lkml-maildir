Hmm, ok. I assume that's what's currently in -mm - I haven't been 
following -mm lately so I missed the fact that the driver in there had 
already moved to module_param().  There's one difference though, and I 
think it matters; my patch sets the permission bits so that the parameters 
get exposed in sysfs (which I think is very useful), the driver in -mm 
sets the perms to 0 (zero) so nothing is exposed in sysfs (less useful).

You are very welcome.
