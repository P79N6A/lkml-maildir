Taking care of all races. Taking care of the case when some symlinks are
not really symlinks (procfs). Not harming the common case (== sane setup).
Well, go ahead, show how to do it.

Oh, yes. And it can't sleep in bottom halves. And it doesn't have embedded
elisp interpreter. So?

Consistent? You do realize that realpath() not returning -ELOOP does not
guarantee that you will not get -ELOOP on subsequent call of open(), don't
you? On _any_ OS. If you don't see why - too bad, I just hope that you
never wrote anything security-related.

Wait a minute. Do you mean that you want _more_ than 32 nested symlinks?

No, it isn't. Let me explain what I mean: most of GNU code in general and
EMACS derivatives in particular badly suffer from the "who cares for
real-life cases" braindamage. I.e. the code is bloated beyond belief for
no good reason.
And IMNSHO whining about said limit without as much as RTFS or figuring
out the basics of kernel architecture is lossage. Very closely related to
the aforementioned, erm, style.
I'm not trying to insult "other projects" (and frankly, I don't really
care), but IMO the coding style and quality of 90% GNU code I've seen is
intolerable for the kernel. It's bad enough in userland, but there it
doesn't inflict lossage on users who do not run it. In the kernel it
affects everybody.

... at decent speed assuming that userland requests are reasonable.
