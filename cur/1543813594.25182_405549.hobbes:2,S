I didn't make it clear here the things affected are not even doing any I/O of 
their own. It's not about I/O resource allocation. However they are using 
100% cpu and probably doing a lot of gpu bus traffic.

What happens if it's using .01% cpu and spends most of its time in 
uninterruptible sleep?
