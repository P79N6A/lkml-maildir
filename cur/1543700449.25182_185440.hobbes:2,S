Please, NO!
Stuff like this
	-       write_lock_irq(&fasync_lock);
	+       if (s)
	+               lock_sock(s);
	+       else
	+               spin_lock(&fasync_lock);
	+
should not be allowed. That's especially true since the choice really is a 
static one depending on the caller.
Just make the caller do the locking.
