Subject: IRQ clash problems with 2.2.14 and 2.3.33?

I have a UP Pentium box containing:
  AHA2940 (and 2 SCSI disks)
  3c509
  Creative/Hollywood+ MPEG decoder card
  Hauppage BT848 TV/FM card
  Matrox G200
  SB16
  USB
  IDE DVD
  2 x serial port
The parallel port is disabled and this still leaves all possible IRQs in
use.  The 3c509 is in "fixed" configuration rather than plug'n'pray.  Under
win98 SE2, everything works as far as I can tell.  I can use the sound card,
watch TV, play DVDs and use the network.
Running either the 2.2.14 or 2.3.33 kernels (and all others I have tested --
these are just the latest I've tried) the 3c509 fails to recieve data.  I
had to disable ACPI in the 2.3.33 kernel because enabling it prevents the
3c509 even initialising to the point where it can bring up the link (I
assume because it does not like sharing IRQ9, which is what happens when I
enable ACPI).  I see no errors reported in the logs in any case.
Suggestions on how to track this problem down would be appreciated.
James.
