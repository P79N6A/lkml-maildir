I did think a while but am still replying.
So it appears that it's not possible to come up with a protecting OS unless
_all drivers that access fragile hardware_ are completely in the kernel and no
side channel (IDE ioctls, scsi generic, io port access etc) is accessible to
userspace and boot media (boot block, kernel, modules) is _write-protected_
(better do it physically).
Doing only some protection will not help since there are other channels left.
Doing all of it is nonsense in 99.9% of todays computers.
The only result that I found out is that the hardware that can be destoryed by
software is not ready for todays world. It should be fixed to not allow
self-destruction (like most monitors are fixed to defend from out-of-range
frequencies). I see no other feasible solutions.
