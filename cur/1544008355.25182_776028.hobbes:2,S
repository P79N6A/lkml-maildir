Indeed. If these flags are added it should only be for network
filesystem access, it would be a real mess for local access.
I guess it makes sense for them to be the inverse of the Windows
CreateFile call FILE_SHARE_READ|FILE_SHARE_WRITE|FILE_SHARE_DELETE
as by default Linux clients would use all these bits for a normal
open.
