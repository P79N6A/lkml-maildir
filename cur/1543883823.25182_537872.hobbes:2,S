Bill thanks for testing.

Umm I don't think make -j20 is a realistic load on 2 cores. Not only does it 
raise your load to 20 but your I/O bandwidth will even be struggling. If 
video playback was to be smooth at that size a load it would suggest some 
serious unfairness. I'm not just pushing the fairness barrow here; I mean it 
would need to be really really unfair unless your combined X and video 
playback cpu combined added up to less than 1/20th of your total cpu power 
(which is possible but I kinda doubt it). Do you really use make -j20 to 
build regularly?

I did notice on your followup email that nice +10 of the 20 makes fixed the 
playback which sounds pretty good.

I assume you mean glxgears when you're running make -j20 again here.

That's nice; shows stability under load.

Great.

Also good.
