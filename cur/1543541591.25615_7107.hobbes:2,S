 I have seen this problem on my notebook with 128 MB RAM even with 
 the final test6. I ran out of memory three times, at one try kswapd
 turned into zombie somewhen. And it seemed to me the system tried
 to swap out anything after a while of normal work although enough
 FREE memory was available. And the shared memory display in top
 and ps was constantly 0. This bug went away with test7-pre1 for me,
 it seems, although I'm not quite sure why, since there seem to be
 no fixes for such a problem. Maybe I just haven't triggered that 
 yet...
