I have one of these - it's an Aztech AZT2320 (mine is PnP, FWIW). I can't
get it working under OSS/Lite (as of 2.2.3 - I haven't tried newer kernels
yet), but it autoconfigures fine under an OSS demo. I also haven't tried
ALSA yet.
If neither OSS/Lite nor ALSA support this chip (I'll take a closer look at
ALSA in the next 2 weeks or so, hopefully), then perhaps that'll provide
me with an interesting summer hacking project (assuming I can get docs)...
:)
