   Dave's suggestion is netfilter - and netfilter is fast enough I
   think. You only need filters on stuff you have already decided is
   for your IP too.
After some thinking, the TAP idea is even nicer as it guarentees zero
overhead, make it such that you only route the BGP stuff over the
device having the TAP attached (make a dummy eth alias just for this
purpose).
