The IDE driver currently knows nothing about APM/ACPI issues.
However, it appears that the CMD643 is the laptop version of the CMD646.
With some help from the outside world for the needs of APM/ACPI for the
required driver calls to IDE, I am willing to look/add DMAing calls that
can be nice redirected to the chipset code with a few options.
Also chipset code may be the preffered location to preseve drive setting
wrt the associated chipset.  This would require an ide_history struct to
be added to the ide_hwifs_s that would reflect device/channel settings.
Disable DMAing and retuning the drives/host combinations to PIO 0 be for
suspend.  Note the reverse is required from resume.  I would expect that a
timer/options would be needed to allow full/limited tuning.  The reason
for this is more for power consumption than anything else.
