yep, agreed.

i believe the 'ideal' solution would be to let users override GCC's
internal memcpy/etc. functions. Right now it's about cld's. But maybe in
the (not so far) future we want to use SIMD instructions to do memory
copies, etc.

great, although problems in this case are never visible during normal use.
This is what makes this issue tricky.

ok, agreed. Although these days anything that is using kernel headers is
more or less considered buggy. glibc 2.0+ has it's own string.h.
will resend the patch with these things fixed, once the 2.3.30
NUMA/bootmem changes stabilize.
