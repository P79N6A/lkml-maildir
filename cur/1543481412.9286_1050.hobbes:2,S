Subject: 2.2.0pre9 sparc headers are incomplete

A couple of examples : the sparc header files don't have a "cycles_t"
definition. a kernel compile failes almost immediately due to this
problem.
The cycles_t was in pre8ac1, but that didn't have a proper pte_read
function definition in pgtable.h, which breaks compilation of the procfs
source.
Is anybody else trying to compile the 2.2.0preX series on Linux/Sparc ?
