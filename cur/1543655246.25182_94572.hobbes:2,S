It is a new message which was added.  They come out when anyone
tries to read from a CDROM drive which is empty.
Recent KDE setups have some gizmo which polls the CDROM once
per second for insertions.  With recent 2.5 kernels, this
results in the above message being sent to logs a couple of
hundred times a minute.
The new printk needs to be removed - I have raised this with
Jens and he agreed.
