Subject: [PATCH 14/14] uml: allow finer tuning for host VMSPLIT setting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/5/369

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Now that various memory splits are enabled, add a config option allowing the
user to compile UML for its need - HOST_2G_2G allowed to choose either 3G/1G or
2G/2G, and enabling it reduced the usable virtual memory.
Detecting this at run time should be implemented in the future, but we must make
the stop-gap measure work well enough (this is valid in _many_ cases).

+	---help---
+	   This is needed when the host kernel on which you run has a non-default
+	   (like 2G/2G) memory split, instead of the customary 3G/1G. If you did
+	   not recompile your own kernel but use the default distro's one, you can
+	   safely accept the "Default split" option.
+
+	   It can be enabled on recent (>=2.6.16-rc2) vanilla kernels via
+	   CONFIG_VM_SPLIT_*, or on previous kernels with special patches (-ck
+	   patchset by Con Kolivas, or other ones) - option names match closely the
+	   host CONFIG_VM_SPLIT_* ones.
+
+	   A lower setting (where 1G/3G is lowest and 3G/1G is higher) will
+	   tolerate even more "normal" host kernels, but an higher setting will be
+	   stricter.
+
+	   So, if you do not know what to do here, say 'Default split'.
