I just checked, and the BIOS auto-detect page for that drive shows PIO Mode 4
and Ultra DMA Mode 5.  The BIOS also shows a summary chart during boot, just
before the LILO prompt, and that summary also reports UDMA 5 for that drive. It
really looks like the kernel is not getting the correct device info from the
BIOS.
As I mentioned earlier, the A7A266 supposedly has an ALi M1535D+ southbridge
"with PCI Super-I/O Integrated Peripheral Controller (PSIPC)", rather than the
ALI15X3 reported by the kernel.
