On the i386, the actual location depends on (a) how much physical RAM
is in the system in question, and (b) the setting of the following
configuration option (found in arch/i386/config.in for those curious):
 Q> choice 'Maximum Physical Memory' \
 Q>		"1GB		CONFIG_1GB \
 Q>		 2GB		CONFIG_2GB" 1GB
If that option is set to its default, then the kernel (and physical
RAM) lives between 3-4G, but if it's set to its 2GB setting, they live
between 2-4G. Either way, user memory lies between 0 and the low end
of the selected range.
Note that there have been rumours of problems on systems with >960M of
RAM where the kernel is compiled for 1GB. I can't verify any problems
as I don't have access to any systems with that much RAM, but I also
can't state what the problems are as the reports I have seen just left
me more confused than before I read them.
Best wishes from Riley.
