The documentation I could find suggests that this may lead to a
security weakness (old data in blocks of a file that was grown just
before the crash leaks to a different user).  XFS overwrites that data
with zeros upon reboot, which tends to irritate users when it happens.
From this point of view, data=ordered doesn't seem too bad.
