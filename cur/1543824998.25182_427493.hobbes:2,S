no hostname -f will deal well with a FQDN gethostname() as long as your
resolver (i.e. /etc/hosts) is setup according to the man page:
> hostname -fv
gethostname()='calista.eckenfels.net'
Resolving 'calista.eckenfels.net' ...
Result: h_name='calista.eckenfels.net'
Result: h_aliases='calista'
Result: h_aliases='eckenfels.net'
Result: h_addr_list='10.0.0.3'
calista.eckenfels.net
Gruss
