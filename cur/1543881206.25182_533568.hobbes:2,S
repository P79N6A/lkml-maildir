Ok - thanks.  Good explanation of how it works.
One more question - why would I want to do this?
Is this like something that would be useful on a laptop, to suspend
activity and reduce battery drain, while preserving the current state
of ones sessions and avoiding having to logout or shutdown?
Or are there other good uses for this?
Is it useful for quietting a system down before doing hot plug or
unplug of key components, such as processors and memory?
Thanks.
