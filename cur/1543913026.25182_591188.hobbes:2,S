That depends. If packages outside of git requires the git-p4 package to function
then this will not suffice and a line saying
	Provides: git-p4
would have to be added instead. If some other already installed package Require:'s
/usr/bin/git-p4import, then that other package is broken and we're toast.
I have a hard time seeing what other package would depend on the git-p4import
script so this was more along the lines of "how rpm dependencies work, kinda"
than a real issue.
