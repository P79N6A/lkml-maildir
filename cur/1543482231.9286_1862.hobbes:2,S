The Renaming Bit:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I tried to rename a fat32x (vfat) dir using the mv and mren command and
basically I get an error like this:
 mv: cannot move `u2' to `u2.a': No such file or directory
The mv line that I used was # mv u2 u2.a
I noticed that in the old days this would work and only mv u2 U2 would not
work.
If I mount the partition as a regular fat system, I can rename the dir to
something like u2.old .
Dosemu vs.matroxfb:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I do not know where to post this one.  I will send it to dosemu.org
aswell.
I ran dosemu 0.98.4.0 while I was using the matroxfb compiled into my
kernel.  I "booted" to dos 7.10 via the emu, no flaming please, and switch
to a different vt.  Most of the vt were black.  The vt with dosemu was
full of funky colors - it looked like it was trying to use some odd
refresh rate of something. 
Sorry guys.
