For FC there is code like the fc_rport stuff which exports a sysfs 
interface but also does a lot more like probing and queue blocking.

And the iSCSI class does do a lot more now too. This just has not been 
updated. It handles the userspace to kernel communication, session and 
connection sysfs interface setup, and there were some patches that added 
the ability to tell scsi-ml to stop queueing commands to a iscsi driver.
Structures like the fc_rport and iscsi_session are managed by the 
transport classes so scsi-ml never knows about them (except for that 
scanning bug). And it is possible to share them between HW and software 
or partial software solutions. I do agree for some iscsi sitautions 
having a layer over the eh or command exection where the transport 
really is more of a layer like your design would be nice (I am not 
refferring to the code duplication though becuase iSCSI would like some 
of yrou fixes :), but at the same time there are places where code can 
be shared between a interface that hides the lower level details and one 
that implements them in software. Maybe it is not this way for SAS though.
