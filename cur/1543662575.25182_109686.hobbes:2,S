Yes, that's what Suparna and Eric were discussing :-)

As long as you don't need any form of synchronization to power
down a device, and if it comes up silent (i.e. no "sleep" mode,
in which it still has enough power to remember DMA lists and
such), that would work.
I'd suspect that power management requiries you to synchronize,
so we're back to square one.
