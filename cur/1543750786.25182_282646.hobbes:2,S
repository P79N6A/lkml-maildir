Please find the attached text files containing 2.6.10
kernel Oops messages 
sent out by the kernel to via the serial port.  The
2.6.10 kernel was 
compiled with all debugging support enabled.  It was
running on a Gentoo 
machine.
At the time of the Oops, one process was doing
iterations of capturing 100 
frames each via BTTV and another was tar untarring a
huge file.
Please let me know what other information you require
and/or if this should 
be sent to other people/organizations/mailing lists.
Thanks,
Marat
