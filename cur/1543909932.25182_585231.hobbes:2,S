No sane compiler can optimise away an atomic_read per se.
That's only possible if there's a preceding atomic_set or
atomic_read, with no barriers in the middle.
If that's the case, then one has to conclude that doing
away with the second read is acceptable, as otherwise
a memory (or at least a compiler) barrier should have been
used.
In fact, volatile doesn't guarantee that the memory gets
read anyway.  You might be reading some stale value out
of the cache.  Granted this doesn't happen on x86 but
when you're coding for the kernel you can't make such
assumptions.
So the point here is that if you don't mind getting a stale
value from the CPU cache when doing an atomic_read, then
surely you won't mind getting a stale value from the compiler
"cache".

They can implement it however they want as long as it stays
atomic.
