I'm trying to get it fixed, it looks as though I may have been premature
in saying that it uses SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND is the reason it doesn't
work (of course I found this out after doing the complete emulation!).
Basically, from an strace, it looks as if ioctl(.., SG_IO, ..) returns
-ENOTTY after another ioctl does so even though it has completed many
times in the past on the same fd. Strange.
So no worries, I'll get it sorted. And I do talk to Joerg from time to
time myself.
