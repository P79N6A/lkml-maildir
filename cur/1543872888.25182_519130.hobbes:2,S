I had been asking around on "what is the fundamental unit of res mgmt
for vservers" and the answer I got (from Herbert) was "all tasks that are
in the same pid namespace". From what you are saying above, it seems to
be that there is no such "fundamental" unit. It can be a random mixture
of tasks (taken across vservers) whose resource consumption needs to be
controlled. Is that correct?
