No, this is not wrong.  Older pci drivers would refuse to load if they
didn't find their pci device in the system at that moment in time.  All
pci drivers converted to the "new" api (new is a very relative term,
some 3 years old now...) will load just fine even if their devices are
not present.
Hope this helps,
