it isn't doing something legitimate since as he said, it was the only 
program that exibited the behavior. Perhaps openoffice was exploiting a 
characteristic of the old schedular to increase it's performance, 
perhaps it's just the way they ended up coding it.  But if it's the only 
one then that's that.

Why would you trust what top says about cpu usage? It lies it lies it 
lies. At best a rough estimate.
Con's scheduler fixes are quite nice. Make sure if you want something to 
hog the cpu to nice it down, otherwise it has to play nice.  Just 
because programs use very little cpu, doesn't mean they wont need some 
in a given time, and that of course will slow down any app that needs 
cpu but is being forced to share, the stop and go even though it's for a 
short time takes time and happens a lot with the more processes being 
run. This is how a multi-user OS should  behave, a render process 
shouldn't be allowed to lag the rest of the system for the sake of it's 
own performance unless you explicitly allow it. Having a loss of speed 
even at nice -20 however, is a problem.
