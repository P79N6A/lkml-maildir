Before anybody complains, please note that I'm ASKING for information
here, not providing any...other than my [mis]understanding of what
actually happens...
From what I've read, I gained the impression that there are in fact
TWO ways that the partition tables in an extended partition can be
used, but from Ted's comments above, that appears not to be the case.
Could I ask somebody to straighten me out on this please, and tell me
what I've got wrong...
 1. An extended partition starts with its own partition table,
    which, like tha master partition table, has four entries.
 2. The way MSDOS uses this partition table is to put the limits
    for a partition in the first entry, and then specify the rest
    of that extended partition as being ANOTHER extended partition
    in the fourth entry, with its own partition table at the
    beginning, and to repeat the process until all space is
    allocated. 
 3. An alternative way to handle extended partitions, which both
    MSDOS and Win9x recognise, although neither creates, is to
    use multiple entries in the base partition table for up to
    three valid partitions (four if they fill the entire extended
    partition) before allocating another extended partition to
    deal with the rest of them.
Obviously, I've been stupid somewhere...
Best wishes from Riley.
