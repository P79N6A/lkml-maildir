Is this simply a language issue?  File systems hierarchies
are more easily manipulated with shell utilities (ls, cat,
find, grep, ...) and system call API's are easier to access
from C?
If so, then perhaps all that's lacking for convenient C access
to a filesystem based interface is a good library, that presents
an API convenient for use from C code, but underneath makes the
necessary file system calls (open, read, diropen, stat, ...).
