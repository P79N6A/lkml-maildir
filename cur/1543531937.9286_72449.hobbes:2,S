The big endian version is wrong, think about it, the correct version
is:
#if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN)
#define clear_suspend(cmd)  ((__u16 *)&(cmd)->cmd_status)[1] &= ~0x4000
#elif defined(__BIG_ENDIAN)
#define clear_suspend(cmd)  ((__u16 *)&(cmd)->cmd_status)[1] &= ~0x0040
#else
It seems very non-intuitive, but if you do all the byte swaps in
your head, it makes complete sense, and what's more this is tested
:-)
I've already sent this fix to Alan for 2.2.15pre, let's not let
this bug slip into 2.3.99pre as well.
Later,
