Mmm.. Okay, thanks for helping track this down.
It appears that this got broken when the ATA_TFLAG_POLLING
got introduced into libata, replacing previous checks of ATA_NIEN.
Or maybe even before that.  Not many of us have qstor cards!
Speaking of which, I'll dig my own qstor card out of mothballs soon,
and work out a proper fix for it soon-ish.
In the meanwhile, could you take a clean kernel, and apply the first
attached patch (qstor_spurious_1.patch), and see if it fixes things.
If not, then you can instead apply the second patch (qstor_spurious_kludge.patch)
and your problems should disappear.  But I cannot actually push that rubbish
upstream, so a "proper" fix will have to come later.
Cheers
