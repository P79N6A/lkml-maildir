    Thanks! Unfortunately, it solves only half of my problem. If I
plug *two* USB storage devices, the second will fail (well, it won't
be assigned the correct device). The perfect solution is to always
use the same dev entry for the same USB device, but I need sysfs for
that (AFAIK), just like udev does.

    Don't know :????
