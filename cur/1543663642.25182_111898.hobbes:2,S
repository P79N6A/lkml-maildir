Nobody ever seems to have solved the threading impact of UKVA's. I told
Andrea about it almost a year ago, and his reaction was "oh, duh!" and
couldn't come up with a solution either.
The thing is, you _cannot_ have a per-thread area, since all threads
share the same TLB.  And if it isn't per-thread, you still need all the
locking and all the scalability stuff that the _current_ pte_highmem
code needs, since there are people with thousands of threads in the same
process. 
Until somebody _addresses_ this issue with UKVA, I consider UKVA to be a
pipe-dream of people who haven't thought it through.
