Cannot build it. Looks like the build system is looping over:
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.c
  KLIBCCC usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.o
  OBJCOPY usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.bin
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/syscalls.mk
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.c
  KLIBCCC usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.o
  OBJCOPY usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.bin
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/syscalls.mk
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.c
  KLIBCCC usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.o
  OBJCOPY usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.bin
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/syscalls.mk
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.c
  KLIBCCC usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.o
  OBJCOPY usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.bin
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/syscalls.mk
No matter whether executed as user or as root. Setting KBUILD_VERBOSE
does not help much, for the log see

 .
