O.K. let's say we flush by default: the global flag is set.
We can have a (short) list of the CPU models which do not require
this flush.
If all of the CPUs are on the list then clear the global flag. And:
static inline void sync_icache_dcache(pte_t pte) {
       if (pte_exec(pte) && global_flag)
               __sync_icache_dcache(pte);
}
Thanks,
Zoltan
