Not sure about crosstool and other platforms but I'm using gcc 4.3.2+
for ARM (on x86_64) and building it is straightforward. Just unpack
binutils, gcc (and optionally glibc); configure; make; make install.
Prerequisites: kernel headers and minimal glibc installed.
(Some recent glibc versions require a patch or two).
