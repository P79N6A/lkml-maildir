Also, no bits were set in the bitmap.. bitmap_create() must've thrown
away the dirty bits.  Given your latest patch, does bitmap_create()'s
"bitmap->events_cleared == mddev->events" check need to be adjusted?
Before I would always see something like:
md0: bitmap initialized from disk: read 13/13 pages, set 1 bits, status: 0
