iirc one goal of systemtap (which uses kprobes) is to be provable
safe so that an user cannot crash the kernel by adding probes. Basically
to make it possible to use this on production systems safely. I have my
doubts they will fully reach it, but at least it's a nice goal.

The Linux convention is to put it into asm-generic/sections.h at least.
