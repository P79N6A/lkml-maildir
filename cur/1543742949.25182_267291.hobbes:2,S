It's on a case by case basis, preempt_disable has the side effect of 
ensuring that you run through that specific critical section without being 
interrupted by scheduling, this happens to also block out various things 
like RCU and the stop_machine (used by cpu hotplug) code amongst others. 
I'm curious what is the excert that you're referring to?
