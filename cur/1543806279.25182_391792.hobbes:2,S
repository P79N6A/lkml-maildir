That shows filesystem information, but not at all the partition table  
information.  If I look at my mac partition table (this is using the  
apple-provided tool under OS X, but it's the same using the Linux  
tool), for example:
hc6524e32:~ kyle$ sudo -H /usr/sbin/pdisk -l /dev/disk1
Partition map (with 512 byte blocks) on '/dev/disk1'
#:                type name                               length    
base      ( size )

Now obviously linux_boot, linux_swap, and linux_lvm are not  
_actually_ Apple_UNIX_SVR2, but that's the type stored in the  
partition map.  They also have partition map labels "linux_*", but  
they do *not* have ext3 volume labels.  In fact, linux_boot is one  
slice of a RAID1 of 3 drives, linux_swap is one slice of a RAID5 of 3  
drives, and linux_lvm is one slice of a RAID5 of 3 drives that  
alltogether make an LVM PV.  If I examine each of those partitions  
individually, I get a lot of other information that is totally  
unrelated to that stored in the partition table.  It would be nice to  
be able to change the type of linux_* from Apple_UNIX_SVR2 to  
Linux_RAID (Max length is 31 characters), and have my userspace tools  
be able to detect that and do useful things with it and the pmap label.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
