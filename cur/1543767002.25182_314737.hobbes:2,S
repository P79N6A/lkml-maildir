Equally users will want to change the drive status and in some
situations will be changing the drive status habitually when using the
tape devices. That seems to have tape level ioctls anyway.

That isn't a problem. The other drivers and O_DIRECT all take the same
basic approach that users doing raw I/O commands can shoot themselves in
the feet. Anything else stops people doing clever things they need to.
What it must not allow (as you explained in your example with mode
select) is let people shoot each other in the feet.
On the info you give making it CAP_SYS_RAWIO for now does appear to make
sense. A tape safe command or filter list might be better eventually
(and/or making the driver put the state back right on open - which may
also be neccessary when drives get powered off independantly of the
host...)
