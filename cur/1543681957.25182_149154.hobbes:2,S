I tried to create a ramdisk image on 2.6.0-test1 and it went pretty bad.
Did:
	dd if=ramdisk of=/dev/ram0
	mount /dev/ram0 /mnt
made a few changes to /mnt then dir 'sync' and:
	dd if=/dev/ram0 of=newrd
When i scanned through "newrd" i didn't see the changes just made.  Tried
with 'umount /mnt' instead of 'sync' - didn't do anything better.
Any idea of what i might be doing wrong?
