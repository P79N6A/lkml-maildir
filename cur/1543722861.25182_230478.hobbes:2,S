They use the AT_ attribute when it is provided.
(Linux 2.4 and above only)
The glibc wrapper is defective; it takes a bad
guess at HZ when the AT_ attribute is missing.
Had sysconf() worked as documented, returning an
error code on failure, it would have been used.
The sysconf() call for getting the number of CPUs
is also broken, at least on SPARC. It would return
a 0 instead of the proper -1 error code. I think
it tried to scan /proc/cpuinfo for CPUs.
