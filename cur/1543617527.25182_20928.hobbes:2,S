Btw, some suggestions:
 - why have those ugly special cases for bootup defines. kmap() is a no-op
   on 1:1 pages, so all those "arch/i386/mm/init.c" games are totally
   unnecessary if you just have the pages in low memory. That gets rid of
   much of it.
 - do the highmem pte bouncing only for CONFIG_X86_PAE: with less then 4GB
   of RAM this doesn't seem to matter all that much (rule of thumb: we
   need about 1% of memory for page tables). Again, this will simplify
   things, as it will make other architectures not have to worry about the
   change.
   (And it's really CONFIG_X86_PAE that makes page tables twice as big, so
   PAE increases the lowmem pressure for two independent reasons: twice as
   much memory in page tables _and_ larger amounts of memory to map).
 - please don't do that "pte_offset_atomic_irq()" have special support in
   the header files: it is _not_ a generic operation, and it is only used
   by the x86 page fault logic. For that reason, I would suggest moving
   all that logic out of the header files, and into i386/mm/fault.c,
   something along the lines of
	pte = pte_offset_nokmap(..)
	addr = kmap_atomic(pte, KM_VMFAULT);
   instead of having special magic logic in the header files.
Other than that it looks fairly straightforward, I think.
