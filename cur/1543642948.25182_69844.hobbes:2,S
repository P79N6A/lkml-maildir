And that's the heart of the thing, if continuing is likely to trash
filesystem or (unlikely) damage hardware, then the system should go down
RIGHT NOW.
I've often wondered if it wouldn't be better to allow the user to provide
a partition for oops use, where the kernel could write kmen and a few
chosen other bit of information. Get all the oops output formatting code
out of the kernel. Then the user could run tools like ksymoops against the
oops after reboot, and a small utility could wrap and compress the oops,
symbols table, config, etc, for future use by the user or developer. 
I've sent a fair number of crash dumps of AIX to IBM, seems a good idea.
And developers could have personal tools, archetecture dependent tools,
ksysoops could be enhanced after the fact.
If it would help with a nasty bug I'd put all that and the kernel source I
used, the module tree, etc, on a CD and send it. Whatever helps solve the
problem. Too often the output is lost on the console and not written
anywhere recoverable.
