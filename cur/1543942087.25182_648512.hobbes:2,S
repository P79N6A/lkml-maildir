I am trying to understand IPsec and found some related
subfolders:
crypto, net/key, net/xfrm, net/netlink
and it may be more folders and files involved in the
process.
Would anyone please tell me how is the flow of
network(internet) information(traffic) from a user
process to the deepest layers of the kernel only by
the name of the most important files and folders in
case of IPsec and a typical TCP, IP(and IPsec) and
Ethernet adaptor senario?
For example: 
setkey(shell command)--> ....(some intermediate
processes)-->crypto(setkey method)  
I guess it should be:
net/ipv4-->net/key-->net/xfrm-->crypto
net/ipv4-->net/core-->net/core/dev.c
What is netlink, is it a kind of socket? how does it
become connected to IPsec?
