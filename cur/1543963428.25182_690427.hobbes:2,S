Hi,
Can you please check whether the patch below solves this problem. Also, please
send in 'dmesg' and /proc/mtrr output after you boot with this patch.
Thanks,
Venki
Use UC_MINUS in reserve_memtype call with -1, when MTRR lookup fails for any
reason.
Change the logic in mtrr_type_lookup to just get the type from the start
address. Using start and end adddress is not right/complete as start and
end can be covered by different mtrr (where old code will fail) or
start and end can be in same mtrr, but still have some different
memory type region in between. Using only start is less restrictive and
deterministic.
