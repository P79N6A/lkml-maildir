Well, the benefit of an AP is slightly more symmetrical and wide
coverage(I _____think_____ - someone PLEASE correct me because I'm quite
unsure) and the range of an ad-hoc network is dependent on the number of
nodes.
So in, like, a living room, Ad-Hoc is probably just as good as using an
AP. But there's really no real advantage between the two. In my
experience using Ad-Hoc I have gotten faster TX rates, mostly because
there's no middle-man.
Still, it's up to you. If you were planning to shell out for an AP I
suggest you just set up a lowend Linux box with hostap driver
(
http://hostap.epitest.fi
) and use that (add iptables for internet
access, or whatever you like). cheaper and in some cases better.
