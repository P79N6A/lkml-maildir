IIRC this was introduced only to keep older ms-windows versions
from complaining about hardware for which no driver existed.
Newer ms-windows versions seem to unhide the smbus like we do.

Yes. Now the question is where exactly we want to execute these
quirks. Before or after restoring pci config space? If we do it
before restoring config space, it might cause some yet unknown
side effects. If we do it after restoring config space, it might
be worse because we would restore config space of a device not
existing anymore.
Thinking about it again, if we restored the full pci config space
on resume, this quirk handling would be completely unnecessary.
Any reasons why we don't do that?
