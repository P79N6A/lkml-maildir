Because some people expressed a wish to have kernels that don't
contain the workaround code, be they P4-optimised or 486-optimised
kernels.  After all we have kernels that don't contain the F00F
workaround too.  I'm not pushing this patch as is, it's for
considering the pros and cons.
CONFIG_X86_PREFETCH_WORKAROUND makes more makes more sense with the
recently available "split every x86 CPU into individually selectable
options" patch, and, on reflection, that's probably where it belongs.
