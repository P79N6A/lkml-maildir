FWIW, I am having to apply Andrew Morton's version of your patches, 
because your patch form isn't quite right.  Review 
Documentation/SubmittingPatches and 
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
Most notably:
* Your patch description follows the "---" terminator, which is 
precisely the opposite of what should happen.  In the correct form, any 
comments such as "Applies to 2.6.20-rc6" should follow the "---" 
terminator, which in turn follows the patch description and signoff.
* Include the patch inline rather than as an attachment.  Even a 
text/plain attachment is very difficult to review and quote in popular 
email programs.
