Obsolete code must die.  Hardware support must live on.

MCA is common for PS/2's, which are still around.

Could never get my OMTI 8627 ESDI controller to work under Linux when I tried.
It works under DOS/Win, Xenix and VSTa though.  These controllers were
pseudo-common early 386 machines (before the 386sx and 386dx) built for
Xenix.
Surprisingly the old NEC ESDI drive still spins up, when most of the 1998 or
1999 Seagates/IBM drives are dead or dying and we've had close to an entire
A1000 Sun disk unit fail to spin up -- the 'top-end' disks of today rarely
seem to last more than 2-3 years (in that if you turn them off after 2-3
years of continual service and turn them back on 1/2 hr later, half of the
drives which haven't spat out a drive head in the interim years will fail
to spin up).
Even old Eagle drives from 1988 still spin up... given you have to flick the
starter switch to spin them up half a dozen times, but they still work...
seems they don't make disk drives like they used to.
David.
