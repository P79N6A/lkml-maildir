So who is the caller? it's the ->open() member of struct
file_operations.  and struct file_operations doesn't have some private
member where I could hide my pointer before saving it to
seq_file.private in seq_open().

Hm, maybe somebody could enlighten me then.  Maybe this is a stupid
qestion, but I wasn't able to figure that out after reading all the
structures, etc.
