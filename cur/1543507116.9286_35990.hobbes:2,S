Subject: PIIX4 ACPI support broken in 2.3.1[45]...

	If I compile PIIX4 ACPI support in the kernel, my computer
(single Intel PIII, 256Mb RAM, ASUS motherboard) refuses
to boot, after recognising exactly such a chipset. Everything works
perfectly in 2.2.x. The message with which it hangs states that VFS is
unable to mount my root filesystem. Curiously enough, booting the computer
with 2.2.12 tells me I have an Intel 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01) at
io=0xd800, while 2.3.15, before hanging solid, types at the console
something like PIIX4 ACPI io=0xe800. 
	2.3.15 seems to run almost correctly, if compiled without PIIX4
ACPI support. A process from Apache-ssl (gcache) takes all available CPU
time, and this does not happen with 2.2.x, but I don't know whether this
is apache's fault or the kernel's.
	Hope this helps...
	Giacomo
