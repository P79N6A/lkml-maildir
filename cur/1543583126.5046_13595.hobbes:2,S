Hi,
seems like ramfs lets the system hang when swapping is involved.
I have a ramfs mounted as /tmp. When I create a large file:
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/xxx bs=1024K count=200
(with 128M RAM), the complete system comes to a halt. Hitting keys does not do 
anything anymore, console switching still works, but all other processes come 
to a halt as well. SysRq still works and by doing a 'saK', I can kill the dd 
process - afterwards, everything is fine again.
Same thing anytime I write large amounts of data to the ramfs.
Now today I even had that problem without writing anything to /tmp: running a 
compilation that creates one process sized ~100M, suddenly everything froze the 
same way as described above. Later a unmounted the ramfs and everything worked 
fine.
B.t.w.: Apart from this bug, ramfs really is a great thing. Mounting it to /tmp 
speeds up a number of tasks significantly! (p.e. browsing into archives with 
mc, which uses temporary files heavily.) IMO, that method should be propagated 
much more!
Ciao,
Nobbi
