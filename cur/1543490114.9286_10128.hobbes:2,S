Subject: [PATCH] bug fix to fs/super.c for 2.0.3x and probably 2.2.x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I finally tracked this one down (after several weeks). The history
is that a custom version of the redhat install wouldn't mount
NFS disks, but it would always work when debugging code was included.
After some looking at the kernel, it turned out that when the mount
of the install filesystem is done, the nfs_mount_options control
block is aligned near the end of a page. 
The code in the kernel to copy the mount options into kernel space
guesses the length of the mount options as 
	MIN(PAGE_SIZE-1, distance to end of VMA)
I have no idea why the VMA boundary falls in the middle of my mount
options (static data), but it does. 
Fixing the copy_mount_options to take this case into account makes 
install work again.
Patch attached for 2.0.36, but I would expect it to apply to 2.0.37
and higher.
The code is the same in 2.0.36 and in recent 2.1 (so I guess it is
unchanged in 2.2).
Philip
