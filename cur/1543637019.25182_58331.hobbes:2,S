Note that smp_xxx_interrupt() functions must be carefull
with preemt_{disable,enable} brackets.
For example, smp_invalidate_interrupt() may be preempted
after put_cpu(). Probably not big deal (it is return path),
but it is better to use preempt_enable_no_resched() here -
let ret_from_intr: do its job.
smp_{error,spurious,thermal}_interrupt() - all of them
use printk() without bumping preemt_count and have problem
after spin_unlock_irqrestore(&logbuf_lock, flags).
If these problems worth fixing, then preempt_stop (cli)
can be killed in entry.S:ret_from_intr(), yes? If i understand
correctly none of the irq handlers should return to low level
code with irq enabled.
P.S.
May I suggest somebody with good english fix
Documentation/preempt-locking.txt?
It states, that disabled interrupts prevents preemption.
Yes, but only in a sense, that the delivery of reschedule
interrupt is suppressed.
Process with irqs disabled and current->preempt_count == 0 can
be preempted (with interrupts enabled) after spin_lock/unlock etc.
Even in UP case preemption can happen while calling wake_up_...().
Oleg.
