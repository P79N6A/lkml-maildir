The platform code needs a way to indicate the given mask will not work.
Rejecting proposals by the driver seems reasonable if the driver
only supports two different masks anyway (eg 64 and 32-bit).
In the case of a platform requiring 64-bit masks for consistent mappings,
the platform DMA code must reject proposals for non-64-bit DMA masks.
(eg PCI-X device implementing less than 64-bits)
In both cases the driver will care because it will crash the box otherwise.
