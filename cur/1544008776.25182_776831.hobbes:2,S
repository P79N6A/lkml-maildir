Btw., i'd love to see this done via the regular regexp interface though, 
if possible - instead of the add-on interface you added.
( Also perhaps enable to toggle tracing via the /proc/<PID>/ hierarchy - 
  a /proc/<PID>/tracing_enabled switch or so. )
Regarding the filter functions, the basic principle should be 
mathematical set operations, like we have it now: add and remove, union, 
wildcards, etc.
I'd suggest a natural and intuitive extension of the current syntax. 
(while keeping all the current bits)
I already suggested a 'inverse' filter in a previous mail:
  echo "-schedule*" >> set_ftrace_filter
This rule operates on the current set of filter functions: it strikes out 
all existing filter functions that match this pattern.
To handle PIDs, we could do something like:
  echo "sshd-312:schedule" > set_ftrace_filter
This would restrict tracing to the sshd-pid:312 task.
Note: the PID portion of the filter rules still stay separate from the 
function names - we dont want per task function filter rules.
A natural variation would be:
  echo "312:schedule" > set_ftrace_filter
to only specify the PID, or:
  echo "312,313:schedule" > set_ftrace_filter
to specify two PIDs, or:
  echo "sshd:schedule" > set_ftrace_filter
to only specify the 'comm' part, which expands to all PIDs where 
task->comm matches sshd. Another variation would be:
  echo "loop*:schedule" > set_ftrace_filter
that matches all PIDs where task->comm matches loop*.
To specify recursive tracing, we could use something like:
  echo "loop*+schedule" > set_ftrace_filter
the '+' would signal that the 'schedule' function is 'expanded' and all 
its child functions are traced as well.
btw., maybe it makes sense to separate the regexp rule-set from the set 
of functions that we are tracing right now. For example:
  $ echo "schedule*" >  set_ftrace_filter
  $ echo "time*"     >> set_ftrace_filter
  $ echo "sys_*"     >> set_ftrace_filter
  $ cat set_ftrace_filter
  schedule*
  time*
  sys_*
We'd also have a separate, current_ftrace_functions file as well which 
shows all traced functions. (on a global basis - with possible PID filter 
rules added where applicable)
I know this will be hellishly hard to implement, but it would be _very_ 
elegant, and _very_ usable.
What do you think?
