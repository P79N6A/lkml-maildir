early platform patches
[PATCH 001/011] early platform driver V3
[PATCH 002/011] sh: add plat_early_device_setup() function
[PATCH 003/011] sh: plat_early_device_setup() for sh2
[PATCH 004/011] sh: plat_early_device_setup() for sh2a
[PATCH 005/011] sh: plat_early_device_setup() for sh3
[PATCH 006/011] sh: plat_early_device_setup() for sh4
[PATCH 007/011] sh: plat_early_device_setup() for sh4a
[PATCH 008/011] sh: add early platform support for earlyprintk
[PATCH 009/011] sh-sci: add early platform support
[PATCH 010/011] sh: add early platform support for earlytimer
[PATCH 011/011] sh_cmt: add early platform support
These patches add early platform driver support to the serial port
driver and the CMT timer driver on the SuperH architecture.
The following patch sets posted to linuxsh-dev are required:
- [PATCH 000/013] sh-sci: platform device, clock and console changes
- [PATCH 00/05] sh: timer patches
The early platform driver V3 patch is a replacement for V2 in -mm.
Thanks for the feedback so far, more is always welcome. =)
