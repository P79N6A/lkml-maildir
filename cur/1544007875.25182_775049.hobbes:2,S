I expect that was the case back in March 2004. 
265b2b8cac1774f5f30c88e0ab8d0bcf794ef7b3 removed the bale-out only for
the direct reclaim path.

It's a change in behaviour, not a "sanity check"!
The bottom line here is that we don't fully understand the problem
which 265b2b8cac1774f5f30c88e0ab8d0bcf794ef7b3 fixed, hence we cannot
say whether this proposed change will reintroduce it.
Why did it matter that "much more reclaim happens against highmem than
against lowmem"?  What were the observeable effects of this?
