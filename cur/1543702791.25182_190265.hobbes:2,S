 Hello !
 Hope this is the right place for getting an answer, I have some
problems with a brand new Plextor-drive, PX-W5224TA/T3B, I cannot
mount any CD or burn a CDR or CD-RW, except if I disable DMA with
following  command :# hdparm -d0 /dev/hdd , a little bit annoying, 
isn't it ?
If I insert a cdrom in the drive the led doesn't go out, it flashes 
as usual but it stays green.
It seems to be a DMA-problem or a kernel-bug ???
Its only a supposition, I am a Linux-newbie, and I am looking
for an explanation and a solution ....
By mounting a cdrom I get following error messages :
  Jan 11 20:46:00 ishwara kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout

And then I have a freeze or at least a blocking of the sysem.
I have to reboot.
Could someone give me an explanation of what is happening and a way to
solve the problem .... is this a kernel-bug ? Or an incompatibility
between the motherboard and the drive ??
If you choose to help me, please don't be to esoteric, as I already
said, I am a newbie.
Please, could you Cc all answers to the adress :
