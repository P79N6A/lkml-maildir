Subject: Linux megaraid 1.05 driver patch for doing pass-through ioctl's

Hi,
While trying to do some pass through commands using the megaraid 466 card,
I got some bizarre error conditions.
The problem was that the megaraid driver just returned the status without
massageing it into linux-friendly values.
Resulting of course in scsi_obsolete errors and requeueing the command.
This patch fixes this by ALWAYS returning DID_BAD_DRIVE on any status
condition for ioctl's on the megaraid host-adapter.
This patch will not influence normal behavior, but it might however have
influence on the megamgr program (which I am not using anyway), that does
do ioctl's on the host-adapter.
Anyway, the patch:
