There is a known problem with ATAPI devices on CK804 chipsets which have 
memory above the 4GB mark, being debugged here:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=351451
If you are running into that one you can workaround it for now by 
passing the adma=0 parameter to the sata_nv module (not sure how this 
would be done on Suse's setup) or pass sata_nv.adma=0 on the kernel 
command line if sata_nv is built into the kernel. If that does help, I 
could ask you to test patches :-)
