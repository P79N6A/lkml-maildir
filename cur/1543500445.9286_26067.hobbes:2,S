Subject: attempt to access beyond end of device
I got the following errors on my system yesterday:
Jun  8 15:22:21 spike kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Jun  8 15:22:21 spike kernel: 08:12: rw=0, want=139826045, limit=1723392
Jun  8 15:22:21 spike kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device

My system does not have quota enabled, nor is it compiled in, just as an
FYI.  The machine *is* a heavy NFS client, and an Oracle server and
general development machine for a dozen or so programmers.
The kernel, 2.2.9, (as mentioned in that prev. email) is patched with the
sw RAID drivers and the DAC960 patch, but the device in question is not
being used by any RAID device.
System summary: Dual PII-450, 1gb ram, RedHat 5.2, gcc 2.7.2.3
