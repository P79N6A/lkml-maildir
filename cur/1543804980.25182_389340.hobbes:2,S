It makes the ' (default)' printk that happens at elevator registration
time behave (more) correctly.  My original patch rather ignored that
segment of code.  The current behavior is to only print ' (default)'
when one was specified at boot time, and not if 'as' was requested
either, since it doesn't understand the 'as -> anticipatory'
conversion.  Now, it will display correctly the one selected at
compile-time, if none was specified at boot, and when the boot-time
option was 'as'.
It also handles modular defaults better; although they cannot be
specified in kconfig, a default requested at boot-time will now still
work, even if it's a module.  When the boot-time requested scheduler
is not loaded, it will fall back to the compiled-in default; when it
is, it gets used.
