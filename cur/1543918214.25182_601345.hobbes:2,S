It would be cleaner to actually parse the ELF; it's only a handful of 
lines of code (we don't have to support arbitrary placement of sections, 
obviously, which makes the problem simpler.)

Uhm, no it doesn't.  Those bootloaders jump to the decompressor, not to 
the payload.  The decompressor interface hasn't changed.

It doesn't have to if it doesn't want to; it only needs to do so if it 
wants to access the kernel as an ELF.  Again, it has the advantage that 
the ELF is the real vmlinux, no funnies.
