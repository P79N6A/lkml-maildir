I think your patch is not doing what you intend to do.

If this currently running task is of the highest priority, we set
busiest_best_prio_seen to '1' and looking at the code, because of this
we never consider any other busiest task which we come across on the expired
list.. This is coming from this piece of code.
	skip_for_load = busiest_best_prio_seen || idx != busiest_best_prio;
skip_for_load is always set to '1'(because of busiest_best_prio_seen)
and we will never be able to move any busiest task to the new queue.

No. It doesn't. In this case busiest_best_prio_seen will be set to '0', when
we traverse the only highest priority task on this queue(which happens to
be on expired list), we set skip_for_load to '0' And we will try
pulling the only highest priority task on this queue to the new queue..
Appended patch(ontop of 
sched-avoid-unnecessarily-moving-highest-priority-task-move_tasks.patch)
fixes these issues.
