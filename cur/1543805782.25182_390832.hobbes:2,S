Which would make it harder to compare against the original, and so potentially
harder to track bug fixes in the original was my thinking.

Well... I'd like to revisit module signing at some point, though I imagine
it'll cause the LKML to melt again by those who think that I shouldn't have
the right to sign my modules because they imagine it impinges on their
rights:-) But I suspect the reason David wants this is so that he can encrypt
something with keys that he's not actually permitted to retrieve
directly. David?
