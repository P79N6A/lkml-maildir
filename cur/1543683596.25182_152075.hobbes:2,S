Hello Dean!
I am not sure, if i understand it, but here I could not use my old
keyboard with kernel 2.6.0-test1. The kernel switched off the keyboard
conntroller while booting.
My keyboard is about 10-12 years old, but it always worked.
There should be a switch for lilo/grub to override the testing.
I have got a via KT400a chipset. The keyboard is an AT/XT-switchable
keaboard.
With a newer PS2-Keyboard it works.
bye, claas
