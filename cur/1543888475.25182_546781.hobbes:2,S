So.. if we get enough clocksources into the tree, can any of those
parts of the code be reworked to use clocksources/clockevents and
hrtimers quickly and easily? I noticed the patch just posted does
some of it.. but not as much as Ben just mentioned.
Or is it a development nightmare?
I'm fairly sure on a PPC970 box even though the decrementer is
monotonic and never changes frequency, one day it just might, and
it would be better to anticipate this (and allow people to
distribute their timing requirements across an entire system
and not just the CPU core anyway, which I think is probably a
good thing from a system integration and possibly the point of
view of redundancy..)
