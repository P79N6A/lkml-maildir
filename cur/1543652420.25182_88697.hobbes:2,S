Hi Linus,
The following four patches are further cleanups to the ext2/3
filesystem.  Please apply, or pull them from:
	     bk://extfs.bkbits.net/extfs-2.5-update
Of note is patch #3, which I've also pushed to Marcelo.  Apparently the
Index/Btree flag compatibility code which was in the ext2 code base of
2.2.19 somehow disappeared before 2.4 shipped.  Fortunatelly, it was
retained in the ext3-2.4 codebase.  The upshot of all of this is that
mounting an HTREE-enabled filesystems under ext2 will cause subtle
filesystem corruptions will cause e2fsck and ext3-htree to complain
bitterly.
