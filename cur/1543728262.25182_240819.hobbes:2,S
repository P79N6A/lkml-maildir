I tried the patch-2.6.7-spa_hydra_FULL-v4.0 patch
I only changed the value of /proc/sys/kernel/cpusched/mode to switch between
different patches.
The 2 threads test passes successfuly (improvement over stock 2.6.7) but none
passed the 20 threads test:

eb seemed to be the worst of the bunch with quite long system hangs on this
particular test.
With the default settings of:
base_promotion_interval 255
compute 0
cpu_hog_threshold 900
ia_threshold 900
initial_ia_bonus 1
interactive 0
log_at_exit 0
max_ia_bonus 9
max_tpt_bonus 4
sched_batch_time_slice_multiplier 10
sched_iso_threshold 50
sched_rr_time_slice 100
time_slice 100
I am not very familiar with all the parameters, so I just kept the defaults
Anything else I could try?
