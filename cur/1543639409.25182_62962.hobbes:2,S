   af_unix.c is linked into unix.o so we have -DKBUILD_MODNAME=unix.  Alas
   we also have -Dunix=1.  __stringify(KBUILD_MODNAME) -> __stringify(unix) ->
   "1" instead of "unix".
This seems really tacky.  There must be a better way to do this.
Perhaps prepending some constant string prefix to these module
names such that they will not collide with the namespace in
this way.  For example, "kmod_".
