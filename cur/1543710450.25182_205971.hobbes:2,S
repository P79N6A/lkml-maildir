You're absolutely right.  I am still trying to come up with
a way to do this.
Note that since we count page->index in PAGE_SIZE unit we
have PAGE_SIZE times as much space as a process can take,
so we definately have enough address space to come up with
a creative allocation scheme.
I just can't think of any now ...
