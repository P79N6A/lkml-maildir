I see this at home, too, but here, I use radvd to distribute a working
IPv6 configuration. However, the root cause seems to be different: this
card (some cheap NE2k clone driven by pcnet_cs) seems to ignore the
router advertisements. If I 'ifconfig eth0 promisc' the interface right
after insertion (before the timer for interface IPv6-auto-configutation
expires), it works as expected...
