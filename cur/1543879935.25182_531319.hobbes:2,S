The shifts (<< 3 and >> 5) are just to get the bits reassembled in the
right positions. The multiplication by 5 and subtracting 1/8 is
because (AFAIK) we can't do floating point multiplication in the
kernel. I'm open to suggestions.

Yeah, mea culpa. I don't like its obtuseness either, and haven't
revisited it since I got it working. Basically the battery has an
array stored in its EEPROM that represents the empty level at various
temperature thresholds. What makes this complicated is that the array
does not contain all absolute values; just the first is absolute, and
the others are relative to it, in reverse order. The above code
converts it to an array of absolute values from low to high. I'm open
to suggestions about this one too.
