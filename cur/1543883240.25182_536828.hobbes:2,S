the same benefit you get from being able to deselect all EXPERIMENTAL
stuff -- the knowledge that you can build a fully-functional kernel
without having to rely on anything that's considered broken or
deprecated or obsolete.
at this point, i think i've pretty much bored everyone to tears making
a case for why i think there's actual value to this feature.  if
you're not convinced, there's nothing else i can think of to say that
will persuade you.

exactly.  being able to deselect deprecated or obsolete stuff en masse
this easily means you can figure out *way* ahead of time whether
finally removing something will cause problems, rather than suddenly
learning that only when the actual removal happens.

yup.  i'm assuming that it's a trivial change to the display routine
to add a parenthesized maturity level (or levels) to the end of the
label when you're running "make xconfig" or "make menuconfig" or ...
etc etc.

in the first place, that would be *entirely* the decision of the
maintainer, just as it is now.  but nothing says that starting to tag
stuff has to affect you in any way.  there should be a top-level
selection that lets you even *activate* the maturity level settings as
part of your configuration.
if you don't want to take that stuff into account, you should be able
to turn it off entirely with a single switch, as in:
  [*] Activate maturity attributes
    [*] EXPERIMENTAL
    [*] DEPRECATED
    [*] OBSOLETE
    [*] BROKEN
if you choose not to care about maturity levels, then nothing will be
filtered at all.  so everybody's happy.

i don't see that being a problem.  personally, if i was building a
kernel for my system, my first attempt would be to build one without
anything tagged DEPRECATED, OBSOLETE or BROKEN.  and if that kernel
failed because a critical feature was left out of the build, i would
be *so* instantly all over the ass of the subsystem maintainer who
erroneously tagged it that way.
this wouldn't make maturity tagging harder -- it would make it
*easier*.

i don't think it would even need that, if people change the way they
do builds by *starting* with only those features that aren't tagged
and seeing if that fails for some reason.  it would certainly be the
way *i* would start doing builds from now on.

sure, i have no disagreement with that.  (um ... was there something
there i was supposed to address?  it just sounded like you were
clarifying what we were talking about.)

nope.  we've been down this road before, and the consensus was that
something could be one of deprecated or obsolete, but not both.  i can
re-post those definitions if you want, or you could read about them

i could have except i just thought of it as i was responding to your
earlier email.  :-)
