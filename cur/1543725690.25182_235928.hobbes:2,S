The comatibility issue affects ext2 too.  It's triggered by the presence
of extended attributes on "fast" ext2 symlinks, something which is
normally only triggered by SELinux; but the problem is not in SELinux,
it's in the core xattr and symlink code.

It's not so simple.  Changing it now would make the new xattr code
incompatible with the old xattr code.  We're somewhat stuck with this
now.

Agreed.  Any oops on an older system is a bug --- ext3 shouldn't be
oopsing on bogus data.  I'll have a look at that (though I'm away for
most of the next 2 weeks so it probably won't be until I get back.) 
Such a bug in any ext3 implementation needs fixed, as it's exploitable
via removable media whether or not there are xattrs in the picture.
