Just for reference: the more threads you have, the less stable your
system is. Ping-ponging work between several completely independent
entities is always a bad idea. Even completion of the request postponed
to workqueue from current execution unit introduces noticeble latencies.
System should be able to process as much as possible of it's work in one
flow.
