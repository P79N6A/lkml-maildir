Here's a few references on NTFS name mangling:

%20Settings.htm
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q130/6/94.asp
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/winresource/dnwinnt/S838C.HTM
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q195/1/44.ASP
A lot of people advocate disabling short-name creation
(

... mangled names are such a bad idea that 
even Microsoft advocates disabling them.
