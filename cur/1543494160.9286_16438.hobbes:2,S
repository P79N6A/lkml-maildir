Ah, that's nice.

Ofcourse.

Yes, at least for the serial console, wait_key returns the character
it waited for. The PC keyboard driver alas doesn't do this yet,
drivers/char/keyboard.c:keyboard_wait_for_keypress() always returns
zero.
You could also use console->read() if it's non-zero i.e. implemented
by the console driver you're using.

You shouldn't really - the idea of the functions from 'struct console'
is that they should _always_ work and not depend on interrupts, memory
mappings, what have you. Again, this is true for the console functions
defined in the serial driver, but not for keyboard_wait_for_keypress().
If you could fix keyboard.c, well, great :)
Mike.
