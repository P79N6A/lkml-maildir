Adaptec SCSI RAID 2110S claims to be a "64-bit/66MHz PCI-to-SCSI RAID
card".  The physical card is longer than normal 32-bit PCI cards with
more pins that fit into a "64-bit PCI slot".  Are Adaptec's claims of
64-bit hardware false?
32-bit Red Hat 9 with dpt_i2o is working great with Opteron and this
card, so I have a safe option to fallback on if we can't fix the 64-bit
operation.
