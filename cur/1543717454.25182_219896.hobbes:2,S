No, not really.  This is the case of "we moved code that was original
kernel-space to user space", and we failed to simulate certain
functions, such as sync_blockdev().

Well, the demonstration test case *wasn't* that simple.  It required
the system crashing twice at very specific points.  Once to create the
filesystem requiring a journal replay, and then a second crash at
exactly the right time in the middle of e2fsck's journal replaying
code.  This failure would be fairly hard to replicate in real-life
conditions, since it would require to crashes in quick succession, at
very carefully chosen points, although if you had really flaky AC
mains, I suppose it might be considered a more likely failure case.

Well, actually it was the e2fsprogs user space code that wasn't paying
attention t the journalling constraints, mainly because we had been we
weren't faithfully implementing sync_blockdev()/fsync_no_super().  The
patch to fix this in e2fsprogs was fairly simple.
