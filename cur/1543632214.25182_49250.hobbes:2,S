   Somehow a call to in_ntoa went into the kernel.
   With that you can't linke the kernel, when CONFIG_ROOT_NFS=y
   is on.
   fs/fs.o: In function `root_nfs_getport':
   fs/fs.o(.text.init+0x10e1): undefined reference to `in_ntoa'
   make: *** [vmlinux] Fehler 1
No, in fact in_ntoa always had existed, except that I finally
killed it.  You're supposed to replace it with NIPQUAD not
the endian-unfriendly %x.
I've sent Marcelo fixes for this if someone else hasn't beaten
me to it already.
