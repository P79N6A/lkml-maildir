BeeCrypt contains benchmarks in the 'tests' subdirectory. Running of
'make bench' will execute them. Benchmarks results below for repeatedly
looping over the same 16K block, produced by 'benchbc', without any
tweaks (YMMV):

I switched to M4 just to make sure the code works on more platforms than
just Linux with modern tools. It's quite easy to convert - it probably
wouldn't take more than an hour or so to produce a version for one fixed
platform.
