So, I started out by building 2.6.9 to test it failed.  It failed.
Then, I started binary searching between 2.6.9-rc4 and 2.6.9, and worked
my way all the way back up to 2.6.9 with it working.  I'm now running
the current CVS as of yesterday, with no problems, and with suspend and
resume working.  I have no idea what changed between the original build
of 2.6.9 that failed, and the final build that worked, but it would
appear to have been something that was my fault.
Now if I could only get 10-rc4-ck1 to not hang on boot...
