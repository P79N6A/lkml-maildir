Driver should work after applying the following patch.  I'm not a kernel
hacker so I don't know how good a solution this is (especially suspicious
of the work around in os-interface.c) but X works on my machine and it has
not crashed (yet) - have not tried any OpenGL though.
Apply this to the extracted tar.gz version of the driver and compile that.
Don't just try and rebuild the binary rpm from the spec file as it will
extract
the tar.gz again and all changes will be lost (there should be a tar.gz
hanging
around once the src.rpm has been installed).
