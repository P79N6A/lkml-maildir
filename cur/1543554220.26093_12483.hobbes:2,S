Well, here's what the sendmail folks **REAL** opinion of Linux is and
the way load average is calculated (senders name removed)
[... sendmail person ...]
 Ok, here's my blunt answer: Linux sucks.  Why does it have a load

So I guess we know where we stand with the sendmail folks.  If the US
post office delivered mail at Christmas time using a size based priority
the way sendmail does, folks would all get their Christmas presents
about mid-February unless O NumberOfPostalWorkers=20 was set high
