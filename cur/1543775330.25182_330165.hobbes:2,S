No it won't - that's a run time test which will only get caught if the
code is run.  There's no guarantees of that.

Yes.  udelay() has overflow issues - if you pass too large a number
to udelay() you get a randomised delay because you've lost the top
bits.
The maximum delay is dependent on the architecture implementation,
and it depends on bogomips.  There is no one single value for it.
Architectures have to decide this from the way that they do the
math and the expected range of bogomips.
Please - leave asm-*/delay.h alone.
