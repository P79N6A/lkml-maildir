Subject: [PATCH 0/4] RT: RT-Overload/Sched v3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/16/216

v3 contains the following changes since v2:
This is still based on 23-rt1 + Steve's last public patch (I think Steve has a
newer version available, but we have not rebased yet).
1) No longer includes the per-cpu-rtoverload patch, since Steve has already
   ACKed it
2) Dropped the affinity patch because it was buggy.  Will revisit later
3) Dropped the pull-patch, since it was RFC only anyway.  Will revisit later
4) Addressed review comments/feedback (added patch descriptions across the
   board, moved semi-colon in while loop, removed superfluous
   smp_processor_id() etc.
5) Got rid of the second TASK_PREEMPTS_CURR() check, since my anaylsys
   determined it was not needed.
With this patch series applied, my RT test now passes and we get an average of
23us wake-up latency under load. You can find the test here:

Note: Do not use the "affinity" option, as the validator has a bug related to
it and may yield a false negative.
Regards,
