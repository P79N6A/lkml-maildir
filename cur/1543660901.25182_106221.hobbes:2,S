That wasn't my point.  All of the other threads have already terminated
without dumping core at tis point; I don't think it's possible for two
threads of a CLONE_THREAD application to both dump core.  See
fs/exec.c:coredump_wait.
Also, once one thread gets into do_coredump it clears mm->dumpable;
nothing else will dump core from that MM anyway.
I think using ->tgid is a good idea.
