Thanks for all response. :)
I think I know more why it downgrades.
But one more curious question.
In the file, arch/i386/Makefile, under kernel 2.5.51.
I found the C3 alignments , $(call check_gcc, -march=c3,-march=i486).
Does the C3 CPU type be included in gcc compile option??
I've downloaded the latest gcc 3.2.1 version.
But I don't find the c3 options in the file gcc/config/i396/i386.c, i386.h
or etc.
BR,
  Joseph
