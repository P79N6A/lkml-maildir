Improving the buffer layer would be a good way. Of course, that is
a long and difficult task, so nobody wants to do it.

Fragmentation is the problem. The anti-frag patches don't actually
guarantee anything about fragmentation, and even if they did, then
it takes more effort to actually find and reclaim higher order
pages (even after the lumpy reclaim thing). So we've redesigned
the page allocator and page reclaim and still don't have something
that you should rely on without fallbacks.

How about a 64-bit pgoff_t and radix-tree key? Or larger PAGE_SIZE?

Luckily we have filesystem maintainers who want to support larger
block sizes ;)

Well, for those architectures (and this would solve your large block
size and 16TB pagecache size without any core kernel changes), you
can manage 1<<order hardware ptes as a single Linux pte. There is
nothing that says you must implement PAGE_SIZE as a single TLB sized
page.
