That's the single dumbest thing I've read today.
newsflash: you don't get to dictate when I (or anyone else) buys new hardware.
Before its accident, that box happily was my home firewall for 3 years, and
its replacement is actually an /older/ box.  I didn't "need a new cpu" at all.
(incidentally, it was replaced with a VIA C3 that doesn't need a fan :)

you snipped the important part of my mail.
"cpu_relax() and friends aren't going to save a box"
We have two completely different things being discussed in this thread.
1. Fan failure, and the possibility to keep running.
IMO, there's nothing we can do here, and nor should we try.
2. Situations where we forcibly lock up and spin the CPU in a tight loop,
producing heat.  Given there are CPUs that benefit from cpu_relax()
in such places, adding them so that they don't unnecessarily sit there
sucking power until someone gets to the datacenter to investigate
can only be a good thing.

I didn't see that being proposed.
