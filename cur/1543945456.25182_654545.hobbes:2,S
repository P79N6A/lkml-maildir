Well, the USB drivers used to add an additional NULL entry at the end of
the list, and then populate it based on module parameters.  That way the
userspace tools would always work just fine, and you could add
additional device ids at run-time.
Now we have a way to do this for all USB and PCI drivers through sysfs,
so it's not needed, but we have to keep the backwards compatiblity for a
while in a number of USB drivers.
Hopefully PCI drivers didn't do the same thing, but I haven't looked at
all of them to verify this or not :)
