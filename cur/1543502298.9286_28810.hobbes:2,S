Hello,
Could someone pls comment on this issue ?? I'd really appreciate it.
Just to "refresh" our minds, this is the hardware:
- Dell PowerEdge 2300, Dual P-II/400, 256MB RAM
- Cyclom-8Yo ISA card (a multiport serial card)
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Ivan

Ok, here it is:

The Cyclom-Y allocated the IRQ as IO-APIC-edge (that's what you probably
wanted to know, isn't it?!).

Tried the patch on the client's system. The results are as follows:
- 'ioapic_level=9' : makes no difference (i.e., problem is still the same)
- 'xtpci=9' : problem is solved (i.e., interrupts are seen by the system)
I'm thinking about notifying Dell about this, but I'd like to hear from
the Linux SMP / APIC people first. Could anyone explain with "slightly"
more details what's going on here?? Is there a way to fix this in
software? Is it useful to contact Dell about this ??
TIA and Regards,
Ivan Passos
