First of all, I give you fragments:
frag_data = 0;
file_size = i_size;
if(i_size_high>>31){  /* high bit marks fragment data */
  frag_data = i_size_high;
}else{
  file_size |= (__u64)i_size_high << 32; /* frag is insignificant */
}
Second of all, you had been planning on extents. With extents,
there should be no need to play around with fragments. You just
use a small block size.
Third, if somebody wants UFS, they can use the UFS driver!
More likely, these people should be using Reiserfs.

Oh well. People used to gripe about ext2 being bloated compared
to the early Linux filesystems. Now we are getting JFS, with its
huge quad-size inodes.

Would you give up 6, 17, 21, or 30 bits? This would chop away at
the protection offered by i_generation.
Since accurate timestamps are generally useful for NFS and "make",
they ought to get at least 30 bits, if not 60. (for the three)
