It would be good if you could run some random input encrypt/decrypt tests 
comparing the C reference version with yours. We have had bad luck 
with assembler functions not quite implementing the same cipher 
in the past.

Is it really needed to duplicate all the C code and tables - can't that 
be shared with the portable C code? 
Also don't make it a separate config - it should just be a replacement
on x86-64.
