I'd like to reliably identify SysV shared memory
in the /proc/*/maps files. On one system, the entries
look like this:
40014000-40015000 r--s 00000000 00:04 0          /SYSV00000000 (deleted)
40015000-40016000 rw-s 00000000 00:04 32769      /SYSV000000ff (deleted)
On my system, they look like this:
30016000-30017000 r--s 00000000 00:06 870318096  /SYSV00000000\040(deleted)
30017000-30018000 rw-s 00000000 00:06 870350865  /SYSV000000ff\040(deleted)
So the key number is in the name, and the shmid
number is the inode number. The device major number
is 0, and the device minor number is 4 or 6.
Other than by creating my own SysV shared memory,
is there a way to tell what the minor number
should be?
