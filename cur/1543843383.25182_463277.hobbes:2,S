if there are lots of tracepoints (and the union of _all_ useful 
tracepoints that i ever encountered in my life goes into the thousands) 
then the overhead is not zero at all.
also, the other disadvantages i listed very much count too. Static 
tracepoints are fundamentally limited because:
  - they can only be added at the source code level
  - modifying them requires a reboot which is not practical in a
    production environment
  - there can only be a limited set of them, while many problems need
    finegrained tracepoints tailored to the problem at hand
  - conditional tracepoints are typically either nonexistent or very
    limited.
for me these are all _independent_ grounds for rejection, as a generic 
kernel infrastructure.

i'm not arguing for SystemTap to be the only option (KProbes is just the 
infrastructure SystemTap is using - there are other uses for KProbes 
too), but i'm arguing against the inclusion of static tracepoints as an 
infrastructure, precisely because a much better option (SystemTap) is 
already available and is usable on the stock kernel. You are of course 
free to invent other, equally advantageous (or better) options.

i dispute that: for example kernel/sched.c has zero maintainance 
overhead under SystemTap, while it's nonzero with static tracepoints. Of 
course SystemTap _itself_ has maintainance overhead, but it does not 
slow down any other subsystem's speed of progress.

the kprobes infrastructure, despite being fairly young, is widely 
available: powerpc, i386, x86_64, ia64 and sparc64. The other 
architectures are free to implement them too, there's nothing 
hardware-specific about kprobes and the "porting overhead" is in essence 
a one-time cost - while for static tracepoints the maintainance overhead 
goes on forever and scales linearly with the number of tracepoints 
added.
