  Well, this is what happened on Motion tablet.
  While still in real mode, BIOS takes care of interrupts from 
devices. But once OS takes control over and goes to protected 
mode, there is no easy way for BIOS to detect that and disable HC.
So, one should either avoid 'sharing' it with other devices (at
IRQ routing stage), or reprogram HC in native OS mode first (at 
least disable interrupts).

  I was not aware of this. However, there is an option and handoff
is disabled by default. DMI table may be Ok if there are only 
a few such machines. Unfortunately, I personally had USB legacy 
problems on several laptops, plus saw some reports on the web.
But I guess it is not for me to decide ;)
