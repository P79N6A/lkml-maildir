    I'm getting a blank screen with radeonfb on two boxes here as
well. One is a beige g3, the other is i386; both have PCI Radeon 7000s
with radeonfb non-modular. 
    On the PC I could see the earliest kernel messages in VGA text
mode before radeonfb took over and the screen went blank -- no
penguin, and the logo is enabled.  Booting with radeonfb:off seemed to
work except for the module problem in -rc2-mm2:
    On the ppc box I tried both -rc2-mm1 and -rc2-mm2.  Both hung and
then rebooted after 3 minutes, so it seems to be panicing somewhere.
I backed the massive-radeonfb patch out of -mm2 and radeonfb worked,
so I got as far as the module thing again.
    So yeah, it's possible that there's something in -mm1 that panics
my ppc, and radeonfb is just making a blank screen, but it seems more
likely that radeonfb is panicing.  I tried to get netconsole working
on both machines, but it didn't work out for unrelated reasons.
    Hopefully I'll have more time to poke at this tomorrow; maybe this
is helpful somehow.
