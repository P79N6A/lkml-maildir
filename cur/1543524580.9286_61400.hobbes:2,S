Hi,
I am trying to finish off the bfs_get_block() function and want to make
sure I understand correctly when create argument of get_block() method is
set to 1 and when to 0. Looking at fs/buffer.c and fs/inode.c it appears
that create=1 iff we write a buffer (as part of a page being written)
which is not uptodate (BH_Mapped is not set) and is 0 in all other cases.
Or is there a more complete formal definition that covers all cases?
Thanks,
