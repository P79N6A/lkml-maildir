The -mm patches apply on top of a clean 2.6.11.
They *should* contain all the 2.6.11.4 fixes, because Andrew includes the
bk-linus.patch in -mm, and the 2.6.x.y policy is that the patch (or a variant
thereof) already be in upstream.  So Linus's tree has to have it in it, so
the -mm tree should have it.
If you find something that's in 2.6.x.y that *isn't* in a subsequently released
-mm, I suggest you contact Greg, Linus, and Andrew, as it means we've collectively
borked something...
