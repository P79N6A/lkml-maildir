G'day,
gcml2 is (among other things) a Linux kconfig language syntax
checker.  Version 0.7 is available at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=18813&release_id=106023
and
http://www.alphalink.com.au/~gnb/gcml2/download.html
There's also an online summary of the warnings and errors from the
syntax checker, with real examples, from
http://www.alphalink.com.au/~gnb/gcml2/checker.html
Here's the change log
*  Warnings can be individually enabled.  Default set depends
   on whether the parser is in merge mode. API functions to
   enable/disable warnings by index and convert a string name
   to an index.
*  Added check for define to nonliteral expression.
*  More precise check for ambiguous comparison against "n" only
   complains for symbols which are forward-declared at the point
   when compared.
*  Made inconsistent-tag warnings more precise; doesn't
   emit spurious warnings about define_bool not having an
   (EXPERIMENTAL) tag.
*  More precise check for forward references and forward
   dependencies can tell the difference between forward and
   undeclared, at the cost of some storage.
*  Check for overlapping definitions by reducing conditions to
   disjunctive normal forms.
*  Added check for forward dependencies.
*  Added check for misuse of and dependency on arch-constant
   symbols like CONFIG_X86.
*  Renamed summarise-warnings.awk -> summarize.awk and installed
   it.
*  Added cml-summarize shell script, which runs summarize.awk.
*  Added cml-check-all shell script, based on old dochecks.sh,
   but now also handles running cml-summarize.
*  Added manpages for cml-check, cml-check-all and
   cml-summarize. Description of errors and warnings for the
   cml-check manpage is controlled in HTML and shared with the
   web page.
*  RPM package support: added spec file, rpm: target.
Greg.
