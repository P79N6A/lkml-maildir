There is nothing preventing a manufacturer to design a card with IDE,
serial, SCSI, video and sound on the same card and with all the
registers within the same mmio region.

The one reason why I do not think this is such a good idea is that
this it will be nasty to put it into the mm layer to deal with cases
where an X server wants to mmap the same registers as are currently
being used by a kernel fb driver and similar.
