Dear kerneldevelopers!
There are some errors in your headerfiles i think. It is not possible for me
to compile e2fsprogs-1.18 with linux-2.4.0-test2. By using linux-2.2.14 i
have no problems, so i mean the problem is your new kernel. I use one
IDE-disk and gcc-2.95.2. This is the report of the compiler. Ahter that i
have some systeminfos for you.
Have a nice day!
