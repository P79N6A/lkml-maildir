The oldest one is difficult to find out sometime. Can we only set the
self name in dts, such as "fsl, rapidio-8641", and add this 'compatible'
property to the driver ids arrays? Such as:
static struct of_device_id of_rio_rpn_ids[] = {
	{ .compatible = "fsl, rapidio-8540",},
	{ .compatible = "fsl, rapidio-8560",},
	{ .compatible = "fsl, rapidio-8641",},
	{ .compatible = "fsl, rapidio-8548",},
	{},
};
How about that?

Do you have the name list? I can change my codes according them.
How about 'Mercurary', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Saturn', 'Jupiter',
'Uranus', 'Neptune',
Or 'Aries', 'Taurus', 'Gemini', 'Cancer', 'Leo', 'Virgo', 'Libra',
'Scorpius', 'Sagittarius', 'Capricornus', 'Aquarius', 'Pisces' ?
Thanks!
Wei.
