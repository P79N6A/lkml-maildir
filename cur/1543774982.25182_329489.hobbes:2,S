I will see what entertainment I can provide.  ;-)

Agreed!  I have updated the document to make this requirement clear.

On i386, writes are ordered.  So if CPU1 sees the callback, it is
guaranteed to also see the data.
However, you do have a good point -- weakly ordered CPUs would need to
have an explicit memory barrier.  This might well already be taken care
of by the memory barriers in the locking primitives used by the up()
operation invoked at the end of oprofile_start(), but I did not check
all the possible ways that these functions can be called.
Given that set_nmi_callback isn't invoked all that often, seems like
it might be preferable to insert an smp_wmb() at the beginning of
set_nmi_callback(), so that it reads as follows:
	void set_nmi_callback(nmi_callback_t callback)
	{
		smp_wmb();
		nmi_callback = callback;
	}
Thoughts?
						Thanx, Paul
