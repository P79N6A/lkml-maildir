	Well, if they're never going to happen, why are there printk's
to tell you it happened? :)  Point is, it should at least tell you what
happened that was never supposted to happen, if it happens to include
profanity, that's fine (by me at least), but it should at least tell us
what wasn't supposted to ever happen. :)
