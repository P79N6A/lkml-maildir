Really, I think you start to over-engineer.  I think this whole stuff
would have a much higher chance if you could come up with a staged set
of patchsets, ala:
 (1) unify the current *notify schemes
 (2) add a filesystem wide notify scheme
 (3) add blocking filesystem notifiers
and then maybe a fourth with all the misc little things that I doubt
will have much of a chance.
