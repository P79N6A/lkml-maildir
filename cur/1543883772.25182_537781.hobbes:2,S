For some strange reason I have a feeling its the former. I remember that one 
of the "Rules of Style" that are pushed by a lot of people is to "Uncuddle 
the Else".
I prefer the '} else {'  style - for the same reason that I prefer the 
'float logf(float x) {' style for functions and similar (where it doesn't go 
beyond 80 columns) in my own code. The reason is that I like trying to keep 
the number of lines with no code on them minimal - helps me to look at the 
output of wc -l to find files where I might have been overly verbose with the 
code and/or comments.
