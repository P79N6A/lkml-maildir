You can try cpufreqd (to set the cpu according to the usage).
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpufreqd
I also use acpi performance states...
For instance on my laptop (Toshiba Satellite Pro 6100 , 2Ghz)
I have this on /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/performance :
[cioby@LNX cioby]$ cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/performance
state count:             2
active state:            P0
states:
   *P0:                  2000 MHz, 22000 mW, 250 uS
    P1:                  1200 MHz, 9800 mW, 250 uS
I often switch to performance state 1 even in if not running on battery.
If I keep it in my lap, and do an kernel compile, I don't want my balls
to get fryed :)
