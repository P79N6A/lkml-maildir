Argh. Can you _please_ use more useful subject lines than "fix plip 1/2"?
Those subject lines are what becomes the single-line description of the 
problem, used by visualizers like gitk and gitweb. So "fix plip 1" is a 
singularly bad such line!
Which is why it should be something like
	Subject: [PATCH 1/2] plip: use netif_rx_ni() for packet receive
or similar.. (My scripts will then get rid of the stuff in brackets, so 
all that is useful for giving information that is interesting while in 
*email*, but not when actually applied as a patch)
