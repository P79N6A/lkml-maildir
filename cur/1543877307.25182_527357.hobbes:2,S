I hope you feel better now that I changed the subject.
Aaron, I see no clear suspect between 2.6.20.1 and current -git
that could explain nor fix a corruption in the r8169 driver.
Can you apply on top of latest 2.6.21-rc5-git the patches available at
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.21-rc5/r8169-20070402
000[12]-r8169-foo-bar.patch have been committed a few minutes ago: you
should check if they apply or not.
netconsole appears compiled as a module. Is it used ?
