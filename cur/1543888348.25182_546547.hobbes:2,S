There are two different things at play here...
1. We dropped libata specific suspend/resume implementation in favor of
sd driven one.  Unfortunately, the new implementation currently can't do
background spinup, so that's probably why you can feel the delay.  We
need to figure out how to do background spinup with the new implementation.
2. To make reset finish in defined time, each reset try now has defined
deadlines.  I was trying to be conservative so I chose 10sec for the
first try.  It's driven by timing table near the top of libata-eh.c, so
adjusting the table is easy and maybe we can be a bit more aggressive
with the first two tries.  But if we solve #1, this shouldn't matter too
much.
So, it's the unfortunate combination of the above two.

I hope it's explained now.

Yeap, that should work.  In most configurations, devices spin up
immediately after power is restored.  sd_resume() just waits for the
device to be revalidated in such cases.
