The POSIX RT standards actually make a reasonable distinction between
threads and processes. A "process" has access to the full POSIX world
of file systems, execs, mmap, ... while a "thread" may live in a simpler
environment. The POSIX minimal RT environment, uses a "single process"
model of the RT world, with "threads" sharing address space within the
"process". This model is quite sensible -- to my great surprise. 
We're moving the RTLinux model towards this posix model with the intention
of being able to allow users to debug code using regular pthreads --
implemented using clone or otherwise, and then recompile to run in 
the RT "single process". 
Since both Larry and Richard have previously taken me to task for not
following POSIX, I expect them to agree that I've done it wrong here
anyways.
