Undeterministic behaviour is worse than deterministic. You can learn 
the system that behaves deterministically.
If you know that unplug damages filesystem on your USB disk, you replug 
it, recheck filesystem and copy the important data again --- you have 0% 
probability of data damage.
However, if damage on unplug happens only with 1/100 probability, will 
you still check filesystem and copy all recently created files on it? You 
forget it (or you wouldn't even know that damage might occur) and you have 
1% probability of data damage.
