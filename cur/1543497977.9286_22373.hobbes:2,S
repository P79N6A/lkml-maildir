I'm trying to get the user-mode kernel to run without needing changes to the 
hosting kernel.  As part of that, I'm looking at using ptrace to do system 
call redirection.
Ideally, I'd like to prevent system calls from happening at all in the hosting 
kernel, but that looks impossible.  My fallback position is to get the hosting 
kernel to execute something innocuous like getpid.  That looks like it should 
work in entry.S, but in ptrace.c, there is this in the PTRACE_POKEUSR code:
	if (addr == ORIG_EAX)
		return -EIO;
which kind of gets in the way.
I just looked at the 2.2.7 code, and it looks like that disappeared, plus 
there is PTRACE_SETREGS, which is what I want anyway.
So, the question is, does anyone remember when that happened?
I haven't written the code to make this work, but the idea is that it will do 
this:
	On system call entry, use PTRACE_GETREGS to decode and execute the system 
call in user space.
	PTRACE_SETREGS and PTRACE_SYSCALL to make the process call getpid
	On system call return, PTRACE_SETREGS to make the system call return the 
user-space value.
Is there any reason that this wouldn't work?
Are there better ways to do it?
