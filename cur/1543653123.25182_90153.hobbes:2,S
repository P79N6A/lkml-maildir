So then your explanation was extremely confused. Can you explain _where_ 
you're doing the ne wsystem call? If it is at execve() time in the parent, 
there is no way in hell I will accept it.
In fact, I have committed the following to my tree to make sure that there
is no user_tid pointer left over when we release a memory space, the old
code was buggy and left the user_tid alone over an execve() which meant
that a subsequent clone(CLONE_VM) and exit of the old process would have
corrupted memory.
Feel free to re-send the "set_user_tid()" patch assuming it is done from
crt0.S, and not from glibc execve() like your original explanation
claimed. Also, please send the set_user_tid() thing _separate_ from 
whatever else you did, since it has nothing to do with your other changes.
