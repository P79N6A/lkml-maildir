Ah. Personally, I quite like standby mode too - no need to vga post at
all. But my lappy's battery is one of those hopeless ones, so it won't
do for long. :(

No - I didn't mean a 3MB/s improvement. I meant that you'll get about
3MB/s throughput. It's _very_ slow. Of course having said that, I don't
recall now what machine I saw that on. It may well be my 933 Celeron
(Omnibook XE3).

How do you think suspend2 does it wrong? Is it just that you think that
everything belongs in userspace, or is there more to it?
