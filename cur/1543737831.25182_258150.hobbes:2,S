Huh?  Then why would anybody use select()?  It can't return a
'guess" or it's broken. When select() or poll() claims that
there are data available, there damn well better be data available
or software becomes a crap-game. And, if you've decided that
such a game-of-chance is okay then please keep your software
out of the new Ethernet Avionics Buses that Airbus now is using.
