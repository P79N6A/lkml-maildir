Erich,
To respond to your specific question, if a thread happens to be in 
kernel mode when some other thread is dumping core (capturing
register state of other threads, to be more accurate) then
we would capture the _user mode_ register of that thread from the
bottom of it's kernel stack. GDB will show back trace untill the
thread entered kernel (int 0x80), eip will be pointing to the
instruction after the system call (return address).
