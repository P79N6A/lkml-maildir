Hi all,
I've stumbled onto what seems to have broken somewhere between 2.4.8 and
2.4.18 (sorry, I've been unable to test it on a later version just yet).
Basically, when using chroot(), syslog() calls don't work.
The following simple example is broken on 2.4.18:
#include    <stdio.h>
#include    <sys/syslog.h>
int main(void) {
    chroot("/home/steve");
    syslog(LOG_ALERT, "TEST");
}
An strace reveals the following:
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_UNIX, path="/dev/log"}, 16) = -1 ENOENT (No such
file or directory)
Is this intentional? If so, is there a work-around? I discovered this when
debugging 'rwhod', but I imagine there are many more utils that would be
affected too.
Cheers,
Steve Micallef
