Thank you for the comments. I have modified safe_smp_processor_id so
that it now checks whether APICs are enabled before using
hard_smp_processor_id. Would this check suffice?
int safe_smp_processor_id(void) {
        int apicid, cpuid;
        if (!boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_APIC))
                return 0;
        apicid = hard_smp_processor_id();
        if (apicid == BAD_APICID)
                return 0;
        cpuid = convert_apicid_to_cpu(apicid);
        return cpuid >= 0 ? cpuid : 0;
}
I will be resending the stack overflow patches reflecting this change.
They should apply cleanly against kernel 2.6.15-rc3. I will send the nmi
handler-related patches separately once I have tested the code properly.
Regards,
Fernando
