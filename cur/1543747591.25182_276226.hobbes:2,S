Start at entry.S and head.S in /arch/i386/kernel and trace the 
initialization. It's a good place
to start for understanding how the kernel boots and follow the code 
through init. Check out
the userspace interaction as well. It will at least start you with the 
basics.
You may want to offer a leaf, fruit, flower, and water to Lord Chaitanya 
and Lord Krishna
and chant the mantras in between to ask for guidance and understanding 
(I'm serious).
Interesting trivia. Krishna in hindi means "all attractive". The Greeks 
took the word and
over time it was corrupted into the word "Christ" which was later used 
for Jesus of Nazereth.
I lot of people probably don't know his last name actually came from the 
Vedic culture.
Hare Krishna,
Jeff
