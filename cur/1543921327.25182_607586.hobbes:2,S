Hi Nish,
Maybe.  I can't tell without knowing the code better.
[make that patch, test it; test patch is below]
Well, it survives light testing (boot/init and a tarball download),
but I don't know how safe it is.

net/atm/clip.c crashes the kernel if it (module) is loaded, removed,
and then loaded again.  Its exit call to neigh_table_clear()
should destroy the cache after freeing it.
