Very vague indeed.  ;o)
/dev/md1 on /mnt/md1 type ext2 (rw,nosuid)
$ df /dev/md1
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/md1             210042576 197033208   2339736  99% /mnt/md1
That is mission critical 210Gb ext2 over software RAID.
>(and that it does not handle files more than 2gig long).

That is a contradition.  ;o)  "Reasonably sure" and "certain" are
pretty close in meaning IMHO.  I don't see how you can be
uncertain, but reasonably sure...  ;o)
