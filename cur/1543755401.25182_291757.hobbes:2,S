I think you are not only using a hammer to swat a fly, buy the wrong 
fly. Would it not do as well to log reparenting? You could even add that 
as an option to init, although if you are being lazy about tracking the 
original parent a kernel log saying something like
   reparent PID1 from PID2 to PID3
would be best. While I think all current reparenting is done to init, I 
could certainly think of a use for a method to reparent back to the 
grandparent, just to keep the accounting clean.
The init option would be unintrusive, but I doubt many people would feel 
the need for a kernel log feature. On the other hand it doesn't happen 
often, I looked at a system up 172 days and it had nothing but the 
daemons reparented (at the moment).
