Hi,
Several laptops have keys that are intended to show battery status. In 
order to present a consistent view to userspace, it would be nice to 
have a standard keycode to map them to. linux/input.h doesn't currently 
provide anything appropriate. What's the correct way of allocating 
another keycode?
