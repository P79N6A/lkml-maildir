Hi.
The attached patch against 2.3.10 (applies fine up to 2.3.11pre5, haven't
checked pre6 yet) adds two ioctl()s BLKSSTAT and BLKGSTAT that provide
disk i/o statistics per (minor) block device. It's an extension of the
basic accounting already exported via /proc/stat. In order to use it, you
have to turn on CONFIG_BLK_EXT_STATS and furthermore issue an approriate
BLKSSTAT-ioctl() on each device you want to account for. See the comments
on top of drivers/block/diskstat.c for details.
Comments?
Daniel.
P.S.: Patches against 2.2.10 and 2.2.10-ac* can be found on
