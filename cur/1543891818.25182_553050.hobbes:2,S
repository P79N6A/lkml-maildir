That's a separate issue from the MTRR mapping though.  Regardless of the 
fact that the system needs some address space in its 8GB range reserved 
for I/O devices, the BIOS should properly setup the MTRRs to map all of 
*available* RAM.  So the person handling your bug report may have been 
confused into thinking that you were describing the former problem.
