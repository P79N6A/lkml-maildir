Looks good. Just two suggestions:
- Provide an mount option to turn it off because there may be
performance regressions in some workload because inodes will be
flushed more often.
[I actually considered doing this generally at the VFS level
when doing the s_time_gran patch, but it needed some more changes
that I didn't want to do at that time. Doing it in the FS as
interim solution would be fine too]
- Use the 2 bits for additionals years right now on 64bit
hosts. No need to keep the y2038 issue around longer than necessary.
