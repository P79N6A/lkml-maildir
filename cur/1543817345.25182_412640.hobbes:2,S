So do you intend to pursue acceptance ? If so, do you think the 
netlink-based taskstats
interface provided by the delay accounting patches could be an 
acceptable substitute for the
interfaces you had (from  an old lkml post, they appear  to be  
/proc/tgid/msa and  a syscall
based one) ?

accounting patches.
