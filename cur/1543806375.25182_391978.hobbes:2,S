You have to add an 'obj-m' entry to the Makefile located in the same
directory as your driver, and make it depend on an option which will
be enabled in some Config.in (in the same directory if possible).
You should look at any driver provided as a patch for the kernel, it
will be fairly easier for you to understand what they touch. And don't
forget one important thing : always ensure that the kernel still builds
with your module disabled. Also, don't forget to add an entry in the
Configure.help file.
