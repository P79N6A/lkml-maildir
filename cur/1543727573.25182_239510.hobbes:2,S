That's not right.
The prefetchnta instruction is three or four bytes long (four if it uses 
the ebp register that needs the "0(ebp)" modrm format).
We use a NOP4 for space in there, and the things you point to are a 
NOP6+NOP7 pair.
Your two nop's are the ones gcc has inserted in order to start the loop at 
a 16-byte boundary (ie c0163300 is the top of the loop). The nop that gets 
replaced by a prefetch is the instruction _after_ the one that faulted for 
you:
	8b 03                   mov    (%ebx),%eax
	8d 74 26 00             lea    0x0(%esi,1),%esi
I think.

I don't think it's obvious yet. It's close to the prefetch, but it's the 
instruction just before. Which in an OoO CPU doesn't necessarily mean 
much, of course - or it could be that the prefetch caused some trouble 
last time around the loop and we only see it now.
Or it could be totally prefetch-unrelated. I do find the prefetch thing 
intriguing, though.
