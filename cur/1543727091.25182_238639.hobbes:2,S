write_forcelock() should be used to avoid readers starve writers, or for 
writers
to update shared data as far as possiable, since it prevents new readers 
acquire
the lock while it's waiting for existing readers release their locks. 
I'm not clear
who will need it now,  since it doesn't affect the original read_lock() 
and write_lock()
I tried it.
