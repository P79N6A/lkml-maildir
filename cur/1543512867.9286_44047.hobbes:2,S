Subject: is lock_kernel() required for lookup_swap_cache() and swap_free()?

I still try to figure out which mm functions need which locking
primitives:
* do_swap_page() calls lookup_swap_cache() without lock_kernel(), but
the documentation of lookup_swap_cache() says that the function relies
on lock_kernel().
* shrink_mmap() calls __delete_from_swap_cache() without any special
locking. __delete_from_swap_cache() calls swap_free(), and it seems that
this function is not thread-safe.
[__delete_from_swap_cache() also increases a non-atomic global variable,
but this looks like debug code].
Btw, I'm not sure that it is a good thing to add the vma_list_sem for
vma-list changes:
* find_vma() and merge_segments() are "short" functions, lock_kernel()
is no major probem.
* the vma_list semaphore looks like a major change.
We would win a lot _if_ we would modify swap_out(): with vma_list_sem, a
big part of swap_out_mm() could run without the lock_kernel(), but I
doubt that such a patch would go in before 2.5.
