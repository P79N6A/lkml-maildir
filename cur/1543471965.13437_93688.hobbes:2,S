 i've been getting alot of them fsking checksum errors over a ppp on
some 33.6K modem, while fetching my mail...it seems that
whenever i start another task (even running a +20 niced task or just 
loging in on another VT), i get flooded with this ....
 during this time, fetchmail freezes, and i just have to wait a few
seconds until it starts fetching again...it's really bothering. Note that
this kind of errors are usually followed by a few lines like:
 
 last message repeated 7 times
 last message repeated 9 times
I'm now using 2.1.131ac9, but i've been getting this since plain old 
2.1.131 ( maybe even before...can test and see, if necesarry).
pppd is 2.3 patch level 5. (is this the recommended 2.3.5 ?)
This is what i usually get (193.226.98.6 is my POP3 host...) :
 TCPv4 bad checksum from 193.226.98.6:006e to 193.226.98.89:0401, len=1480/1480/1500

 the sender's port is always 006e, destination is sometimes 040a, 0411,
0400, 0401, 0407...
 i don't know what to make of this...
 i'm willing to test patches, if this is a kernel prob.
 thanks, 
 radu
