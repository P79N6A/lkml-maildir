Here I think we are forgetting that glibc is userspace and there's no 
separation between the application code and glibc code. An application 
linking to glibc can break glibc in thousand ways, indipendently from fds 
or not fds. Like complaining that glibc is broken because printf() 
suddendly does not work anymore ;)
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
        close(fileno(stdout));
        printf("Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?\n");
        return 0;
}
