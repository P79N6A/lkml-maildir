You can do this in the other direction from user space. Have the
driver add a sysfs attribute containing a list of allowed MD5s for
firmware images. Now modify /bin/firmware_helper to check the file
against the valid list and abort if there is not a match.
Doing this in user space will make it easier for the user to debug
what is happening when things fail.
