No, not really. At least not after the genirq stuff went in. I used to
be a bit concerned about the generic irq code being too heavyweight,
but I think handle_simple_irq() might be just what we need for
chip-internal interrupt handling.

You're probably right. I'll see if I can get it converted to genirq
one of the next days.
