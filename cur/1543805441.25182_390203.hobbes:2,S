symlink will not work, sorry.

What are the contents of these different files?
Remember that sysfs is one value per file, so sysctls translate usually
very easily to sysfs files.
You can always just use /sys/kernel/perfmon/ if you like, as I don't
think you are bound to anything that would be in the /sys/devices tree
(you don't export per-cpu statistics, right?)
Hope this helps,
