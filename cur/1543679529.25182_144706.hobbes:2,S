Version 2.6.0-pre1 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
After this there will be one or more further -pre versions with
changes to the kernel/user-space API, which are needed to ensure
binary compatibility between x86 and x86-64, and to permit future
extensions without breaking ABIs.
Version 2.6.0-pre1, 2003-07-02
- Rearranged the data structure holding the counter state to
  reduce the number of caches lines needed to be touched at key
  operations. The new representation is also binary compatible
  between x86 and x86-64, which matters since user-space mmaps() it.
- Added RPM spec file for the library. (From Bryan O'Sullivan).
- Patch kit updated for kernels 2.4.22-pre2 and 2.5.73.
