Yes, I think your argument makes sense. I had initially thought of
making the enums a mask
MEM_CGROUP_TYPE_MAPPED = 0x1,
MEM_CGROUP_TYPE_CACHED = 0x2,
MEM_CGROUP_TYPE_ALL = 0x3
and check for control_type & MEM_CGROUP_TYPE_CACHED

Yes, we need to lock the page group.

Yes, my bad :(

I am going to rip out the control_type interface for now. The locking
needs fixing irrespective of control_type. I am sending out a patch to
rip out control_type.
