What Abhay is trying to say is that default firmware.agent when it
does not find requested firmware file writes -1 (abort) to "loading"
attribute causing firmware_request to fail.
I think it should be fixed in firmware.agent though, not in kernel -
the agent shoudl just recognoze that sometimes not having firmware
file is ok.
