Just to counteract all the 2.5.60 bug reports...
After the akpm wave of compile fixes, I booted 2.5.60-BK on my Wal-Mart 
PC [via epia], and ran LTP on it, while also stressing it using 
fsx-linux in another window.  The LTP run showed a few minor failures, 
but overall 2.5.60-BK is surviving just fine, and with no corruption.
So, it's working great for me :)
