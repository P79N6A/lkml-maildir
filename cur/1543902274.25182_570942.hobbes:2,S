The clanking when I walk annoys people in the office too...
But you're right.  It is stupid of me to make such a big deal about
this.  My excuse is that I've seen those warnings so many times and
actually given them more thought than they deserve, and I really felt
that Jeff's change makes the admittedly already ugly code a tiny
little bit worse.

Given that you took the time to do this, I'll get the patch into a
working state and apply it.  And maybe split it into reviewable chunks
while I'm at it ;)
Thanks,
