Busmice don't even have a byte-oriented protocol, so they're not
relevant here, and indeed for serial ports we can use ttyS.
Now there are a few drivers for the KBD/AUX interface that are not
i8042-based - most drivers in the serio directory. Those all would need
to be patched for enabling raw mode.

If we can do that reasonably easily via sysfs, then I'm all for that
route.

It'd be good to find out what devices we don't support yet (I know of
ALPS, which we have a patch pending for and IBM TouchPoints), too. 
As an interim solution, your patch plus a simple serio->userspace driver
would work, too.
