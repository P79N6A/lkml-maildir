Ahhh I created a bogus partition on my machine too due the fdisk bug! And
to check if that was the case for me too I had the bad idea to:
	cp /dev/zero /var/tmp
where /var is the last partition with the additional (out of bound) sector
included.
After some time the kernel crashed and I destroyed all partitions of my
hard disk. _all_. Note that the partition table was still fine. Only the
contents of the partitons (superblocks mainly) was completly screwed up.
fsck was complaining no-magic number.
fsck -B4096 -b xxx -y using a rasonable correct backup-superblock (it had
at least the magic number in the right place ;) continued running for 5/10
minutes then exited complaining something. Then fsck using the backup
superblock wasn't working anymore. So i run fsck with the master
superblock and it worked but then after 10/15 minutes of `yes` fsck
started complaining WARNING ERROR IN FSCK OR YOU HAVE THE DISK MOUNTED or
something like that. I hadn't the disk mounted at all...
Now (after some hour wasted in restoring the system completly :() I
removed 1 sector from the last partition and cp /var/tmp works fine.
This is my current partition that now works:
BSD label for device: /dev/sda
5 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:  1226752     2048      ext2                        # (Cyl.    2 - 600)
  b:  8192000  1228800      ext2                        # (Cyl.  601 - 4600)
  c: 17772544        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    1 - 8678)
  d:  6144000  9420800      ext2                        # (Cyl. 4601 - 7600)
  e:  2207744 15564800      ext2                        # (Cyl. 7601 - 8678)
The old partition looked like this:
BSD label for device: /dev/sda
5 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:  1226752     2048      ext2                        # (Cyl.    2 - 600)
  b:  8192000  1228800      ext2                        # (Cyl.  601 - 4600)
  c: 17772544        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    1 - 8678)
  d:  6144000  9420800      ext2                        # (Cyl. 4601 - 7600)
  e:  2207744 15564800      ext2                        # (Cyl. 7601 - 8679)

The partition `c' had the right vaue, while fsck suggested me to use 8679
for the end of the last partiton `e'. I didn't cared about the correct
partition c limit as partition c is a kind of black magic that I don't
like and I have to ignore in first place....
So this is a warning for people having partition c stopping before one of
your partition. fdisk is right about partition c. Trust its end and not
what fdisk suggests as end of other partitions.
I think the fix is simply a -1 in some line of fdisk... Looks like a
silly/typo bug. I cc'ed to the author of the bsdlabel in our fdisk. If he
can't fix that I can do that myself.
