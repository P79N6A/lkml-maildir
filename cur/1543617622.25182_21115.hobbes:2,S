Shortly: the winner is 2.4.18pre2aa2 for me (but it's close).

(and if anybody is interested at all)
I have tested many different variants during last week:
/boot/bzImage-2.4.17          /boot/bzImage-2.4.18-pre3-ac1_sh7_ml
/boot/bzImage-2.4.17-rc2      /boot/bzImage-2.4.18-pre3-ac2-sh7-ml
/boot/bzImage-2.4.17sH5       /boot/bzImage-2.4.18-pre3-ac2-sj0-ml
/boot/bzImage-2.4.18pre1      /boot/bzImage-2.4.18-pre3h4p
/boot/bzImage-2.4.18pre2      /boot/bzImage-2.4.18-pre3ll
/boot/bzImage-2.4.18pre2aa2   /boot/bzImage-2.4.18pre3sH4
/boot/bzImage-2.4.18pre2aa2r  /boot/bzImage-2.4.18-pre3sH5
/boot/bzImage-2.4.18pre2l     /boot/bzImage-2.4.18-pre4-si3-ml-p-l
/boot/bzImage-2.4.18pre2s     /boot/bzImage-2.4.9
And as far as I can tell, 2.4.18pre2aa2 is the winner for my desktop.
My usual (and testing workload) consists of KDE2.2.2, Mozilla,
xmms/mp3, mplayer/divx, tuxracer etc.. while 1-2 compilations on
background with nice +19. I experienced most interactive desktop with
-aa kernel.
(My HW is Atlon 850, 256MB RAM, KT133A VIA, Matrox G450).
