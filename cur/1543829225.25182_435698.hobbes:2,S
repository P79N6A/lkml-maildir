Subject: 2.6.17-mm1: kernel/lockdep.c: write-only variables
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/22/203

The following variables in kernel/lockdep.c are write-only:
  nr_hardirq_read_safe_locks
  nr_hardirq_read_unsafe_locks
  nr_hardirq_safe_locks
  nr_hardirq_unsafe_locks
  nr_softirq_read_safe_locks
  nr_softirq_read_unsafe_locks
  nr_softirq_safe_locks
  nr_softirq_unsafe_locks
Is a usage pending or should they be removed?
