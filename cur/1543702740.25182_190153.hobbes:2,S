Subject: [PATCH] mark ide-cs broken
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
After receiving this bug report: 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1457
and talking to Arjan, it would appear that IDECS is known to be broken.
Arjan has confirmed that he sees the same behaviour with his PCMCIA CDROM
using both 2.6 and 2.4.2x kernels.
Therefore, I suggest that we mark it broken.  The patch below is for 2.6.1
kernels.
If anyone wants to know the details of why it's broken, please don't mail
me - I don't know - the best I can do is refer you to the above URL.
As far as bug 1457 goes - I'll reassign it to "Drivers - Other" later today
since we don't have an IDE component in bugme.
