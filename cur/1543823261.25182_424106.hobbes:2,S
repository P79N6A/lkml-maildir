Note that some PCMCIA architectures simply _will_not_ give you a private 
IRQ. Ever. They may not have any ISA interrupts to give, even to old 
16-bit cards. So the choice may be "shared irq or nothing".
So I would strongly argue that any driver that depends on getting an 
exclusive IRQ is buggy, not the PCMCIA layer itself, and that it would be 
a lot more productive to try to fix those drivers.
Especially since exclusive irq's are clearly a dying breed, and have been 
for the last decade or two. Why try to keep that braindamage alive?
