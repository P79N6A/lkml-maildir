Hello
I would like to know, if I switch on "SCSI emulation" in my
2.4.25 kernel,
1) Will some kind of interface be added to my kernel?
2) If yes, where is this interface specified?
Bugreport:
"man bootparam" mentioned in help for SCSI emulation option doesn't work
on all systems (at least my LFS)
"see documentation of your boot loader for how to pass options
to your kernel":
1) proper place for kernel commandline option specification is not boot loader
doc but kernel doc
2) where is the "linux kernel boot time parameter interface" specified?
