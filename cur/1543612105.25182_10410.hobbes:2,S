I don't see how this is a win for me. And it is a win for IBM only if it
gives them some advantage in serving their customers. I can certainly
*conceive* of workloads bursty enough to justify an 8-processor server, but
do they exist in the real world? And if they do, is a single 8-processor
server better than a pair of 4-processor servers when you take graceful
handling of faults into account? IBM has been building high-availability
systems for *decades*, preferring to field *slightly* slower but
*significantly* more reliable gear, which, legend has it, no one has ever
been fired for purchasing. :-)

Perhaps effort should be placed into software development processes and
tools that deny race conditions the right to be born, rather than depending
on testing on a 16-processor system to find them expeditiously :-). And
there is a whole discipline of software performance engineering to build
performance in from the start. Advances like that would be a *huge* win for
the Linux community, given our (relative) freedom from corporate-world
limitations like deadlines, sales quotas, programmer salaries, and
full-color brochures.

No, but we can release partly-baked VM schemes that have a shelf life on the
order of days :-). Seriously, though, I don't like stepping on someone
else's dream, especially since *my* dream -- a GFLOP dedicated to computer
music -- has been fulfilled for about $1500 US. When I bought that machine,
I thought I was going to need two processors -- one to run the OS and
service the keyboard, mouse and monitor and a second dedicated to generating
audio samples in real time. I had no idea how powerful these chips were
until I started shopping around. And when I loaded the Atlas linear algebra
library up on my Athlon and saw the speeds it was getting, I was in shock
for almost a week!
However, as I said in another post: "Moore's Law: good. Amdahl's Law: bad."
I guess the new generation has to discover Amdahl's Law for itself, and
*this* distinguished but elderly scientist is eager to be proven wrong :-).
