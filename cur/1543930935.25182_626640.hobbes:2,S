That wasn't the issue.  The interface to the cachefiles module would
just consist of cachefilesd writing a string label to some pseudo file
tell cachefiles what label to apply as the acting label for operations
performed by cachefiles.  Which isn't SELinux-specific at all.
David was asking though how cachefilesd (the userspace agent) would
obtain such a label to use.  And that may very well be LSM-specific, and
as there is no LSM userspace API, it makes sense for him to invoke a
libselinux function at present.  If a liblsm is later created and
provides a common front-end API (internally dlopen'ing the right shared
library based on some configuration, whether libselinux or libsmack or
whatever), then cachefilesd can instead call the liblsm interface, but
that doesn't exist today.
