OK.

It is. The break is forced not earlier than after one jiffie, but
it may loop for up to 2 jiffies.

Do not cheat yourself. 10 is more than 1 by order of magnitude.
I would eat this argument if the limit was 2. :-)

But I do not know what exactly to look for there.
Please, explain who exactly obtains an advantage of looping.
net_rx_action()? Do you see drops in backlog?
Actually, I could see a sense in your approach if you said
something sort of: "I see drops in backlog, I want to increase
it to 3000, but it breaks latency, so that let it remain 300,
but instead I will make 10 loops". This would be sane justification
at least.
net_tx_action()? It does not look critical.
