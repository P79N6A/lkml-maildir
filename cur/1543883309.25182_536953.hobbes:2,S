that he'll redo all the tests to re-verify his original regression

curious, which are the reports where in your opinion CFS behaves worse 
than vanilla? There were two audio skipping reports against CFS, the 
most serious one got resolved and i hope the other one has been resolved 
by the same fix as well. (i'm still waiting for feedback on that one)

a good idea for Mike to re-test SD 0.46?
