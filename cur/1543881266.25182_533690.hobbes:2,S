SMT is indeed an issue, so i think what should be used to scale 
timeslices isnt num_online_cpus(), but the sum of all CPU's ->cpu_power 
value (scaled down by SCHED_LOAD_SCALE). That way if the thread is not a 
'full CPU', then the scaling will be proportionally smaller. Can you see 
any hole in that?
