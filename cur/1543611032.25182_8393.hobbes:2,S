Just use "dmesg" instead, that will give you a correct order if you are
looking for bootup messages.
Problem is that /var/log/messages is not ordered according to the time when
messages were contrieved, instead it is ordered in any order depending on
when syslog wants to write the message to the file. The mess you are seeing
propably has something to do with the fact that /var/log/messages isn't
mounted immediately at boot, and thus cannot be written before syslog starts
and has access to the file.
