When booting kernel 2.2.5 under Debian 2.1, I get the error as attached.
Once booted, everything seems to work fine. I'm guessing this error has
something to do with networking... Any hints? Because it appears setserial
is run later in the boot process, I don't think its causing the problem,
or is it? The version of /etc/rc.boot/0setserial that I'm using is slink
default.
