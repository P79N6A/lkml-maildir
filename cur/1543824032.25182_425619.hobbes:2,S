well, I think it is interesting ...

yes, I absolutely agree here, this will be one
of the tougher nuts to crack, and therefore it
might be an excellent candidate to proove that
the different virtualization camps can find an
acceptable solution .. together.

this, OTOH is something I'm not convinced of,
because looking at BSD jails, I see a very simple
approach (only one IP, limiting binds) which seems
to be sufficient for all the BSD jails out there
this is probably something which does not meet the
requirements of fully blown distro virtualizations
but actually it might be more than sufficient for
'mainline' linux jails

yes, I would also appreciate if we could get some
support from the network folks, as I think, most 
of them are already working into that direction
(think Van Jacobson's net channels, routing tables)
especially as the network virtualization brings up
a number of questions, which are not easily answered
like the following:
 - what policy will be applied inside guests?
   + allow arbitrary packets/rules/routes
   + have some generic limits/basic rules
   + put policy into userspace
 - how to 'connect' the virtual interfaces to
   the real network?
   + via routing and bridging?
     (means duplicate stack traversal and 
     therefore twice the overhead)
   + via split personality interfaces?
     (less overhead, more complicated cases)
   + directly (only by isolation)
 - at what level should the virtualization happen?
   + ethernet level (all protocols)
   + ip level (all ip based and control protocols)
   + udp/tcp level
best,
Herbert
