Every single non-PCI controller has been broken by this code.
pata_get_dev_handle() assumes that the passed ata_port is PCI. The
libata-core code does not do any checking. This causes everyone to
experience oopses with pata_pcmcia for example.
Multiple examples of the bug in our FC7test tree reports from end users
trying the new libata and kernels.
