Yes, it might make the whole thing binary incompatible (so we could
have a new glibc major release :-) ) Not sure.

This won't help. It will change the attack pattern though (so it may help
a bit). If the stack grow upward, then the data from the caller, passed to the
callee will be used to create the overflow. Taking control this way is still
possible.
And the stack grow direction is controlled by the CPU stack operation and
we can't change it.
