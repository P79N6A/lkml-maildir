Maybe you should add the above description into 
Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt.
The users of netconsole applied these patches may think that they can change 
parameters of netconsole_target(param string created at the time of parsing 
boot/options).
And I'm going to search the another solution of this problem and read the 
code of configfs.
Thanks
