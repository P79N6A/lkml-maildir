That's currently a special case. The architecture is optimized for the
common case and currently compares quite favorably to other systems, even 
those that use zero-copy approaches..

The Linux network stack is much faster than any decent software encryption
scheme, all of which make a dozen or more read/write rounds on its
input, so that isn't a very interesting case. The interesting cases for 
networking are file and web serving, and these seem fairly amenable to the
IO-Lite style approach (even some dynamic content).
