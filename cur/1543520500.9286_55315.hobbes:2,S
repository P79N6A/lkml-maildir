These words seem to be used interchangeably. However, a 'process'
is a functional software entity that has a unique identity.
A 'task', however, could be a thread or even a called procedure.
So, what `ps` shows are processes. They have unique PIDs.
What `strace` shows are (sometimes) tasks executing within your
process context.
Cheers,
