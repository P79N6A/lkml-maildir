While you're moving IDE towards accepting the BIOS's view of the world,
maybe you have a minute to check probe_cmos_for_drives() and see if you can
fill in the C/H/S data from somewhere else (eg, the BIOS data returned by
Andries' in the patched setup.S), rather than from drive_info, which has the
bogus data from the INT 41h/46h vectors.  Mark Lord's comment just above
this routine about getting the info from INT 13h has come true in the new
version of setup.S.  (Mark is, I believe, also of the opinion that the whole
probe_cmos_for_drives() routine should probably be trashed.)
That would allow me (for example !) to run LILO correctly without having to
specify C/H/S values at boot time, on my system where hd0 points to the
first SCSI disk, not the first IDE disk.
