You're missing the point.
Think about the name of this function:  dev_kfree_skb_any()
If this function cannot be used -anywhere-, then the concept (and the 
net stack) is fundamentally broken for this function.  We must _remove_ 
the function, and thus _I_ have a lot of driver work to do.
[jgarzik@sata linux-2.5]$ find . -name '*.[ch]' -type f | grep -v SCCS | 
xargs grep -wl dev_kfree_skb_any | wc -l
