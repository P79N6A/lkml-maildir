What do people actually use atime for, anyway?  I've always
noatime/nodiratime'd most servers I've set up because it saves so much
disk I/O, and I have yet to see anything really use it.  I can see that
in some cases it would be useful to turn it _on_ (perhaps for debugging /
removal of unused files, etc.), but it seems silly that the default case
is a situation which on the surface seems dumb (opening a file for read
causes a disk write).
