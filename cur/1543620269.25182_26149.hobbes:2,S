This is totally untrue, unless the socket doing non-blocking I/O -- and
even then you get -1 and EAGAIN from sendto.
Otherwise sendto is very much a blocking operation which will block until
there is enough space in socket buffer to store the data. From there,
there is no way to "lose" that data before it hits the wire, unless of
course the network driver is broken and doesn't plug the upper layers when
its TX queue is full.
Think of it: if what you said were true, NFS over UDP would be totally
useless. But it's not, so if UDP data gets lost before it hits the wire,
it's usually a bug in the network driver.
From the limited testing I just ran, I appears that starfire and 3c59x 
handle this correctly, whereas tulip always loses a small number of 
packets during a UDP storm. ttcp -us[rt] is very useful for such 
testing...
