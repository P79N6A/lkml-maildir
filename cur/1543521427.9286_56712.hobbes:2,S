	I don't know what IA64 time_t will be, however if DEC Alpha is
	of any model, the problem is *not* that bad.  (Alpha has 64-bit
	time_t)
	Presuming the software in next 20 years will widely be written
	in 64-bit machines (with 64-bit time_t), it will become trivial
	to change time_t in 32-bit cadgets.
	After all Linux 'jiffies' counter does overflow far sooner, and
	system seems to survive it just fine these days. (ia32)
