Hi Ingo,
thanks for the quick response!

We tested this and it looked good. But inserting a udelay(100) like:
	...
	prepare_arch_switch(rq, next);
	udelay(100);
	prev = context_switch(prev, next);
	...
leads to a crash after 10 minutes. Again this looks like accessing an
empty page.
Does anything speak against such a test? It is there just to show up
quickly problems which we might normally get only after hours of running.
Regards,
Erich
