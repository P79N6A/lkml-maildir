An easier way might be to use a system emulator like Qemu.
You can specify the amount of memory the emulated system has,
and if you do not use the kernel accelerating module (kqemu)
it slows down considerably.
Of course, it would be nicer if you could actually specify performance
levels and an issue with this approach is that it does not uniformly
scale down performance: I think IO emulation performance is a lot worse
then CPU emulation performance (in Qemu).
With friendly regards,
Takis
