Hi all,
	Im running RedHat 6.2, with kernel version 2.2.14-5.0. I have a 
kernel module that traverses the whole directory tree structure accessing
all files. Im checking the d_count in dentry struct for directories. I see
that the d_count sometimes has some random values around 5-1000,
sometimes. How should I call dput() when traversing directories.
Can someone enlighten me on the significance of d_count in dentry for a
directory.
		TIA,
			Shankar
