Subject: klogd -f logname "append to logname" patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

(For anyone else who shares the opinion that
  klogd -f /var/log/kmsg -x
should append to its kmsg log file instead of overwriting it.)
-f insulates klogd messages from syslogd bugs (although you can't split
them up into multiple files the way that /etc/syslog.conf enables). You
can always solve any klogd-to-syslogd problem *after* you find out what
is otherwise wrong with your kernel (and lose the -f switch then if that's
what you prefer or require). But when you are debugging a kernel deadlock
with no oops, for example, and actually have local persistent storage
to write to, it helps if the next hard reset doesn't truncate the -f
pathname when klogd opens it.
