Something is foobar'ed.  The latter process has already died and the first
process is in a state where it cannot be killed.  A process usually
shouldn't be in `D' state for a longer time.  If it is then the usual
reason is something like access of a NFS access to a server which doesn't
answer or hopefully more rare, a bug.
