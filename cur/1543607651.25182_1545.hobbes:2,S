I was thinking about that, and that doesn't seem right to me -- you
can make closed-source derivative works based on BSD but I would
typically not refer to them as "BSD" license (think SunOS 4.1 here...)

I think the idea of making a standard set of macros available is a
good idea for two reasons:
a) It avoids mispellings;
b) It makes it possible to apply standard definitions to the codified
   strings.
