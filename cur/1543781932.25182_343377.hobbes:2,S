It's deliberate but historical. It's been a long time since I worked on
it, but it was meant for "special opens".
I _think_ it was used for things like "open block device without media
check" etc (we use O_NONBLOCK for that now), and it was used for directory
opens before we had O_DIRECTORY. (It's literally been years, so my 
recollection may be bogus).
I don't think anything uses it any more, and it should probably be 
deprecated rather than extended upon.
