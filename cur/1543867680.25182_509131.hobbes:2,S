The idea was to have spu_get_profile_private return the kref pointer,
and then change the user of that to do
+       if (!spu_info[spu_num] && the_spu) {
+               spu_info[spu_num] = container_of(
+				spu_get_profile_private(the_spu->ctx),
+				struct cached_info, cache_kref);
+               if (spu_info[spu_num])
+                       kref_get(&spu_info[spu_num]->cache_ref);
