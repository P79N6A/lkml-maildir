Clear boundaries should be enough.  If each instance of CKRM is assured
that it has control of some subset of a system that's separate and
non-overlapping, with all Memory, CPU, Tasks, and Allowed masks of said
Tasks either wholly owned by that CKRM instance, or entirely outside,
then that should do it, right?
