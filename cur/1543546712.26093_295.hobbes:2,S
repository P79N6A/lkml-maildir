the label you point at looks like a redhat label and not a kernel version
at all. And that is installed in your /usr/src/linux, of course.
But to find the Linux (I repeat Linux, as in OS, not as in
distribution) kernel source code, you go to
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4
there are hundreds of official mirrors of ftp.kernel.org worldwide, please
use the closest to you.

Tigran
