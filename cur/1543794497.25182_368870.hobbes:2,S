You'd have to get agreement from *all* the kernel's past
contributors. As some of them are dead this is not likely to happen.
(Well, OK, you could isolate their code and rewrite it but this
would be a big and annoying job, so you'd need a very compelling
reason. One extra filesystem isn't likely to be good enough.)
