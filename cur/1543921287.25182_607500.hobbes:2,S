Subject: [PATCH v3] pcmcia: Convert io_req_t to use unsigned int
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[PCMCIA] Convert some internal-only ioaddr_t to unsigned int
Convert the io_req_t members to unsigned int, to allow use on machines
with more than 16 bits worth of IO ports (i.e. secondary busses on
ppc64, etc).
There was only a couple of places in drivers where a change was needed. I
left printk formats alone (there are lots of %04x-style formats in there),
mostly to not change the format on the platforms that only have 16-bit
io addresses, but also because the padding doesn't really add all that
much value most of the time.
I found only one sprintf of an address, and upsized the string accordingly
(I doubt anyone will have anywhere near INT_MAX as irq value, but at
least there's room for it now).

Ok, so let's switch to unsigned int. Only exception I made was to stick
to u_int in the struct itself to keep it common with the style in the
rest of it.
This also resulted in a much smaller diff, since I didn't have to change
any printk formats (see above about 0-padding).
