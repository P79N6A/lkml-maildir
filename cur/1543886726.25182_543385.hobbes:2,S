Andi, Andrew:
Here's a little set of cleanup patches.  They're general cleanups,
but also the final prerequisites for the Xen series.
They are:
 - move pieces of i386 SMP into a common file, so they can be used by
   other sub-arches and Xen
 - Make vsyscall (and vdso) use the common linux/elfnote.h macros
 - Add kstrndup
 - Add argv_split
 - Cleanup and generalize the call_usermodehelper APIs
 - Add a common orderly poweroff function
 - And some more usermodehelper cleanups, to change the "wait" arg from
   a semi-cryptic int into a less cryptic enum.
Thanks,
	J
