Subject: NPTL: pid of a thread and gdb

I am using the NPTL ilbrary to create a thread.
In NPTL the parent and the thread have the same pid.
Then on what basis gdb differentiates between the
threads which have the same pid ?
gdb gives following message when it encounters a
pthread_create() statement:
[New Thread 1075138688 (LWP 7034)]
[New Thread 1077242800 (LWP 7037)]
the LWP 7034 is the pid of parent process (in this
case LWP is same as pid).
from where does it calculate LWP 7037 for the thread ?
(in this case LWP is different from pid, pid for the
thread is still 7034)
