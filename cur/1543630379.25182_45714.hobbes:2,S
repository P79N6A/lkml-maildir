	Nope.  There are three issues here, really.  The second item, "User
Mode Access" is probably one or both of two things.  A "native" IBA
interface (aka Verbs).  These are the actual IBA work elements.  Things
like Subnet Managers need access to this.  The other is uDAPL (user
Direct Access Programming Library).  uDAPL (and kDAPL) are emerging
standards for high-speed messaging systems (VIA/IBA/Myrinet type
things).  uDAPL is likely the protocol most of userspace will want to
program to.
