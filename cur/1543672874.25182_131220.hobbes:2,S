Hi!
...what is the problem?
It seems that function pointers into modules do not need any special
treatmeant [I *know* there was talk about this on l-k; but I can't
find anything in Documentation/]:
                if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
                        return -EACCES;
                if (disk->fops->ioctl) {
                        ret = disk->fops->ioctl(inode, file, cmd, arg);
                        if (ret != -EINVAL)
                                return ret;
                }
So... what's the problem with {un}register_ioctl32_conversion being
called from module_init/module_exit? Drivers in the tree do it
already...
