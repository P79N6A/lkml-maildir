Actually he is the author of the software in question, and has 
maintained it for a decade. Anyone who reads the cdwrite mailing list 
knows that I have criticized his endless whining that Linux doesn't do 
things right, but aside from the cosole output whining about Linux from 
his program[1], and the fact that it must run as root[2], the real 
cdrecord works in more cases, with more hardware, produces working burns 
in more cases, and has more useful output, and is the software to use in 
preference to wodim.
[1] cdrecord advises to use Linux 2.4 (and I think Solaris), and says 
you should avoid using readable names for devices and use some 
pseudo-SCSI numbers he likes instead.
[2] Linux developers filter commands sent to devices to protect them 
from commands like erase BIOS. Joerg uses vendor proprietary commands 
for greater functionality, and says if you have write on the device it 
shouldn't be filtered and those commands should be permitted by the 
filter. (That is a simplification, there are personal issues on both sides).
