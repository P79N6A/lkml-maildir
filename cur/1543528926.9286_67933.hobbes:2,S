The suggested solution breaks parser (xconfig). 
Xconfig "by design" does not accept duplicated config options.
This has also another disadvantage: if you configure for both EISA and PCI
you are asked some questions twice, eg:
> +      tristate '    Generic DECchip & DIGITAL EtherWORKS EISA' CONFIG_DE4X5
> +      tristate '    Generic DECchip & DIGITAL EtherWORKS PCI' CONFIG_DE4X5
How the common driver should be compiled if you answer "y" to the first and
"m" (or even "n") to the second ?
IMHO, it should be enough (and be a good way) to make dependent on
CONFIG_PCI just the drivers which support *ONLY* PCI cards, 
eg: Tulip, PCI NE2000, RTL-8139...
BTW, notice that it cannot be done with dep_{bool,tristate} function as
CONFIG_PCI may be not defined for some architectures.
