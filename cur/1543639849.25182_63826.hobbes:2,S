Interesting. Even up-to-date notebook are not much faster on an ext3 fs:
egger@sonja:/localstuff/temp$ time dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M
count=600 ; sync 
600+0 Records ein
600+0 Records aus
real    0m58.375s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m4.930s

This is trivial especially with mainstream machines being shipped with 
GigE.
