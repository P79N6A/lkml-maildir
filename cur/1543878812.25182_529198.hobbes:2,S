With all these discussions about fixes for telldir, do we want to
persue an alternative interface where the user can explicitly specify
that no telldir/seekdir will ever be used?  From what I know so far it
would make technical sense since we could speed up/reduce the memory
footprint of readdir in 99% of most programs.  But is the benefit
large enough to warrant a second interface?
