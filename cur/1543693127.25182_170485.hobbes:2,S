Well, it didn't work -- I inserted the following line in pegasus.h:
PEGASUS_DEV( "SpeedStream", VENDOR_SIEMENS, 0xe240,
DEFAULT_GPIO_RESET | PEGASUS_II )
Because that's what appeared in /proc/bus/usb/devices. But now, modprobe 
pegasus hangs (the process, not the machine). Also, any attemp to access 
/proc/bus/usb hangs the process. Kudzu hangs too. Now I reached the 
limits of my knowledge. :(
