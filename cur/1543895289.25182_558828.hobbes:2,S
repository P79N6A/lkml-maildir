It's loaded right now... that is with 2.6.22-rc4-+something (one of the
working ones).  I don't know WHEN it was loaded though. Probably
not at the same time as the others. 
And
hikaru:~>dmesg | grep agpgart
Linux agpgart interface v0.102 (c) Dave Jones
No 'Detected' line :/
Also, I noted that this 'agpgart: Detected..' line is always(?) printed
right after (often even without THAT line having printed a newline yet!)
something like:
udev: Waiting for /dev to be fully populated...agpgart: Detected an Intel 965G Chipset.
And this 'udev: Waiting for /dev to be fully populated' (sorry, didn't
write down the exact phrase, this is from memory) is also not printed
by kernels that work.

PS I asked you move to the other thread - it's a bit annoying to have
two threads about this now.
