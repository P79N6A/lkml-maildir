Why would we want to miss that when so much effort was made to meet the
requirements of the traditional /dev/random?  So...
Here's patch v2.1.2 that waits at least 0.1 sec before reseeding for
non-blocking reads to alleviate Ted's concern wrt waiting for reseeds.
When reading nbytes from /dev/{u}random, Legacy /dev/random would:
 - Mix nbytes of data from primary pool into secondary pool
 - Then generate nbytes from secondary pool
When reading nbytes from /dev/{u}random, Fortuna-patch /dev/random would:
 - Mix ??? of data from input pools into the AES key for output generation
 - Then generate nbytes from AES256-CTR
Perhaps I miss the subtlety of the difference in terms of security.  If
nbytes >= size of both pools - wouldn't Legacy also be vulnerable to the
same attack?
