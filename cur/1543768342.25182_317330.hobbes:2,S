My EM64T Dell Precision 470 seems to have problems both before
and after this change, though the behaviour changes.
With -rc3..
testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#1: NMI appears to be stuck (0)!
With -rc4...
Testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#4: NMI appears to be stuck (0)!
The CPU #'s are consistent across reboots (Ie, they're always the same).
Though the rc4 behaviour seems odd, as my CPUs are numbered 0-3.
Bill (Cc'd) also reports that with -rc4, he sees around
a 10 second delay when it does that 'Testing NMI watchdog'
message.
