Subject: [PATCH] [7/18] Abstract out the NUMA node round robin code into a separate function
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/16/167

Need this as a separate function for a future patch.
No behaviour change.
