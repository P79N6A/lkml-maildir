Tried linuxcare's PPC kernel tree (fetched via rsync) and it is working.
Some changes had to be dealt with, but I'm sorting this stuff out. I've
discovered that I shouldn't use DRI. :) Also, with 2.4.0-test10, in 16bpp
depth, I get weird white pixels on solid color areas. 24bpp mode takes
care of it.
