Yes, it was the first thing I suspected, so I went out to the fabled Golden
Shopping Centre and bought all the alternative disk controllers I could (except
for 3ware, which I lacked the cash for).  I tried HighPoint HPT 370A (Adaptec
1200A), HighPoint HPT368, Promise PDC20270 (FastTrack 100Tx2), and the PDC20276
built onto the motherboard, and a HighPoint HPT302 which didn't work properly at
all.  I still got the lockups with various permutations of the non-Silicon Image
chipsets, and found that to my amazement, the Silicon Image 680 chips gave the
best performance.  I too had major problems with CMD64x boards on a production
2-CPU system (server for student accounts), so remained with SCSI on that
machine.
Bugzilla for the kernel?  I didn't know there is one!  I'd better find it.
Thanks Dave.
