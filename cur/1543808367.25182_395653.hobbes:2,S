Hello dear developers,
I today booted the first time my embedded device using Linux 2.6.15.2,
which was booted by pxelinux, which then bootet itself from the nfsroot.
This went pretty fine, but when I was reading through
Documentation/nfsroot.txt I saw that there are some more modern versions
available of loading the kernel and passing parameters.
So I added them and the patch for that is attached to this mail.
Sincerly,
Nico
P.S.: Please reply to nico-kernel2 //at// schottelius.org
