There are two fundamental problems with that statement:
 - no, it really isn't always
   Quite often, our Kconfig files have dependencies that are about where 
   the *code* exists, rather than about some nice hierarchical system.
   Think of it this way: would you use a programming language that didn't 
   allow you anything but totally hierarcical language constructs? No sane 
   person would - because real life isn't hierarchical. Yes, there are 
   many things that are, but not all things are.
   Example: many cryptographic algorithms are in crypto/. But then a lot 
   of them ARE NOT. They are in arch/so-and-so/crypto/ or similar. Notice? 
   NOT HIERARCHICAL.
 - I don't use menus at all. I use the good old textual "make oldconfig". 
   Trust me, I _want_ those irrelevant questions gone. They aren't "grayed 
   out".
So you seem to have this *wish* that real life was different than it is. 
But we aren't hierarchical, and even if we were, it *still* wouldn't work 
the way you want things to work.
