I just realized I made a few errors/omissions in my previous post.
Here is what I should've said -
In console mode, as a normal user, I tried to open a 22mb file
on my Slackware 7.1 (kernel 2.2.16) system.  Pico displayed reading
file for a short time, and then switched to "cannot allocat 32bytes",
 and a second later "cannot allocate 48 bytes".
I switched to VT2, and tried to login as root.  After I typed root, I got the following
/bin/login - error in loading shared libraries libcrypt.so - failed to map memory segment from shared object - cannot allocate memory
and then init : id c2 respawning too fast,: disabled for 5 minutes
on VT3, same thing, except an additional message
/bin/agetty - error in loading shared libraries libc.so.6 - cannot allocate zero fillpages - cannot allocate memory
and then the init : id etc. message for c3.  The exact same output on VT4 and beyond, except cannot allocate zero fillpages appeared in place of failed to map - etc for the first error message.  Sorry for the bad grammar, but I am in a hurry to get somewhere.
MY machine = pentium 700 128mb ram.  I have duplicated this error three times on the same machine, and can supply you with any required info.
