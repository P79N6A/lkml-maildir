I think you mean 1.1892 and 1.19318 (as in your patch). However,
according to the AMD Elan 520 manual, the timer is actually 1.1882 -
could you double check your figure and/or make mention of the Elan520
in your patch? I suppose we should check with AMD and make sure we get
all of their weird ones.
Thanks,
Giuliano.
