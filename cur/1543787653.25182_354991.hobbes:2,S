Rafael, I still can't reproduce the issue. All of my EM64T systems are SMP
and looks like this problem happens only on an UP system. Looks like
there is some code flow which is still assuming the presence of low mappings.
Andi, can you please see if you can reproduce this on one of your systems
similar to Rafael's.

I looked at init_apic_mappings() and didn't give me any clue.
alloc_bootmem_pages() don't use low direct mappings.

Are you saying "noapic" is the second data point or you need to use "noapic"
along with moving zap_low_mappings(0)
