I think it comes down to an expectation that if the behaviour is
undefined, anything _could_ happen, but what should happen is that it
should just be passed along to (in this case) strcpy un-modified.
Anything _could_ happen, but why do something that probably won't help
all the same?
But this is moot anyhow since I _think_ Paul's suggestion of doing RELOC
and friends as asm will work (and echo'd by rth?).
