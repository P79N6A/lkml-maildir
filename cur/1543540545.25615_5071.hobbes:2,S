Hi guys,
I enabled ACPI support and get "ACPI: support found" on boot followed by
"ACPI: namespace load failed". I don't know ACPI spec. I enabled ACPI in
the BIOS and the motherboard manual (GA 6BXD) says it does support ACPI.
Any ideas?
(this is not critical for me as I utterly don't care about any PM - I was
just going through various bits to see if they are working or not and am
willing to help debugging what is broken)
Regards,
Tigran
