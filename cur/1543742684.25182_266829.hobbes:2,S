For _what_?
Real applications, or SpecInt?
The fact is, SpecInt is not very interesting, because it has almost _zero_
icache footprint, and it has generally big repeat-rates, and to make
matters worse, you are allowed (and everybody does) warm up the caches by
running before you actually do the benchmark run.
_None_ of these are realistic for real life workloads.

.. it shaves off a few cycles in the cached case, yes.

Which is only true on moderately stupid CPU's. Two pop's don't _really_ 
depend on each other in any real sense, and there are CPU's that will 
happily dual-issue them, or at least not stall in between (ie the pop's 
will happily keep the memory unit 100% busy).
