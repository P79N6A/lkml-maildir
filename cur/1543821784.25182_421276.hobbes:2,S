Yeah, that's also what some other drivers do. For example, PCI/PCIE
bridges may support capabilities (like hotplug) that are controlled
by separate drivers. These drivers don't do pci_disable_device()
when they unload, since the bridge must continue to decode even
when the other capability driver is gone.
The problem is that most PCI bridges don't have any "extra"
resources padded into the address ranges they pass down. It
would be nice to be able to reuse address space released when
a device is disabled (e.g.  for future hot-add), if it's really
no longer needed.
