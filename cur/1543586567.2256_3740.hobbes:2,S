Names stay constant, but why the NUMBERS? The names should stay
constant and represent the actual layout on each busses (say:
sane hierachic enumeration) of course.
But /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 could get a new device
number on every reboot, right?
I'm sure, I'm missing some important usage of device of device
numers here (not counting the ones listed already), but I don't
know what ;-)
Otherwise it would be too easy to remove static major/minors and
all the fun allocating them. And LANANA would have one thing less
to worry about ;-)
One thing I certainly miss: DevFS is not mandatory (yet).
Thanks & Regards
