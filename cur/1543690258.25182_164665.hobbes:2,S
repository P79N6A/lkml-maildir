Yes, ECC is only for IA-64. ICC is for x86. ICC does not require
intrinsics because it supports asm inline, and it can build the kernel.
Please look at
http://lists.insecure.org/lists/linux-kernel/2002/Oct/8790.html
 for
example.
Note that asm inline support is just one of many GCC extensions required
to build the kernel, and for optimization purposes Intel compiler for
IA-64 chose not to support inline asm, but it uses intrinsic to do the
equivalent things.
Thanks,
Jun
