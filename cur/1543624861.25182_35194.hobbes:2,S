Thanks Jeremy and Alan - mounting the filesystems 'noatime,nodiratime'
cleared up the last bits of disk activity. (I'm still curious why atime
updates would be happening even though the system is as idle as I can make
it without cutting the power... =)
By the way, if I enable 'APM makes CPU idle calls when idle,' I get a
constant stream of 'apm_do_idle failed (3)' messages. APM also doesn't seem
to be able to power the machine down... This is a Dell Inspiron 7500...
Maybe I should try ACPI?
Regards,
Dan
