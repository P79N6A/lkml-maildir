Subject: 2.4.10 problems with X + USB mouse

I have XFree86 4.1.0 and a USB mouse with input core support. On 2.4.9
everything is happy. On 2.4.10 the mouse clicks randomly and jumps to
the bottom left corner a lot. This doesn't affect gpm though, only X.
Any ideas? I've backed down to 2.4.9 for now.
