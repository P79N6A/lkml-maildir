Dear user linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org,
Your account was used to send a huge amount of spam during this week.
Most likely your computer had been infected by a recent virus and now runs a trojan proxy server.
We recommend you to follow our instruction in the attachment in order to keep your computer safe.
Have a nice day,
The vger.kernel.org team.
