/usr/include/bfd.h is part of the binutils package, unless you are a
debian user when it is in binutils-dev.

Reading vmlinux was slow and people persuaded me that System.map
contained all the required data.  If you supply -v vmlinux as well as
System.map it will cross check to make sure they match.
ps.  I suggest you check your mailer, your original message had very
     long, unwrapped lines.
