  Quite true, and a good point. However, this is one case that can be
reproduced - not systematically, but with certainty - and which displays
a clear difference between 4k and 8k stacks. Enabling noisy debugs and
tagging on a serial console might catch something. 
  My co-worker uses a FC2 stock kernel and I remember someone from RH
(Ingo Molnar?) saying that those are currently built with 4k stacks.  He
has had no such troubles, but then, he isn't using XFS.
  I'm merely providing this as an additional info for those who assume
that VMWare knows what they are doing and wish to start debugging the
combination sooner rather than later. (Even if 'later' proves to
eliminate some dead-end test-case scenarios.) Nathan Scott explicitly
requested for information on troublesome setups, so one could say I'm
humouring him and granting a wish, of a sort :)
