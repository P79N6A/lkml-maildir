[gq}]
there is an example and associated discussion of doing this sort of
wedging (similar to screen or script, as mentioned in another post) in
W. Richard Stevens' "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment".
also i think 'expect' may be a useful utility to look at for an example.
good luck, it sounds like a very worthwhile project you are working on.
