I have this mad idea that you can divide a 128GB machine up into 256 fake
NUMA nodes, then you use each "node" as a 512MB unit of memory allocation. 
So that 4.5GB job would be placed within an exclusive cpuset which has nine
"mems" (what are these called?) and voila: the job has a hard 4.5GB limit,
no kernel changes needed.
Unfortunately this is not testable because numa=fake=256 doesn't come even
vaguely close to working.  Am trying to get that fixed.
