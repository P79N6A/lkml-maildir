yes, map_user_kiobuf() works only on user addresses. You'll have to add a
map_kernel_kiobuf() function - which is probably super-simple as it doesnt
have to do any security checks and doesnt have to sync with the VM data
structures. You also might want to add an alloc_kernel_koibuf(),
free_kernel_kiobuf(), to let the kiobuf code allocate/free pages for you.
