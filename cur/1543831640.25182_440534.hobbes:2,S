We silently keep files around in many filesystems, at least until
whatever reclamation process runs.  The delete event doesn't itself
generally purge the data from disk.  However, this is a matter of simple
tools doing simple things.  Designing an intentional structure around
not actually deleting deleted files, but keeping them around just in
case may be lauded as "user-friendly", but it is counter-intuitive.  It
is cleverness over clarity, good design smothered under feature demand.
In the ways in which it counts, in the sensible, useful, elegantly
simple ways, the "Do one thing and do it well" ways, Linux tries to be
Unix-like.  We want stupid programs.  A filesystem that decides that it
knows better than the user is not desirable.  Filesystem programmers
that decide that they know better than the user are likewise sub-optimal.
Protect my data against accidental failure.  Do not protect it against me.
If you have to add a "really delete, I mean it" command, you're breaking
fundamental assumptions.

Why add non-free space to the free space count, when we're intentionally
keeping those files?  If you have to be counter-intuitive, why go the
second counter of hiding it from the user who "wants us to keep and
index his deleted files"?
