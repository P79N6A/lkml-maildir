FWIW, my system currently lurks around 300W from the outlet. This is
including one 21" LCD (some 30W - 50W). System is a dual dual-core
Opteron, 8x Raptor and 2x XFX 7950GT.
Full pull it does a bit above 400W. If the PSU has 80% efficiency then
it delivers around 320W to all components.
I'm pretty sure your 350W PSU is adequate.
	With kind regards, Sander
