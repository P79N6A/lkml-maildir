With same hard drive connected to 3ware S-ATA controller I got 
40-50MB/sec with hdparm on 2.6.4 and 2.6.5. Then
tried to hdparm -a 8192 /dev/sda, and got this:
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   2056 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1027.13 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  266 MB in  3.00 seconds =  88.53 MB/sec
So you may try that switch, maybe helps.
