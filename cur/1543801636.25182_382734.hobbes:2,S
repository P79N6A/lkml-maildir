Would it be impossibly hard to make the >64 cpus case (when the code
switches from a single word to an array) be dependent on a boot-time
variable?  If we could, then the defconfig could just say 128, and
users of monster machines would just boot with "maxcpus=4096" to increase
the size of the bitmask arrays.
