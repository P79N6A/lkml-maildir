Agreed.
That being said, I think a more flexible scheme is called for; I still
would like to suggest the MAP_MAXADDR and MAP_MAXADDR_ADVISORY flags
that I mentioned earlier.
If people really want to retain the (rarely used) suggestion address,
I'd suggest making the address argument a pointer to a structure:
struct map_maxaddr {
	void *search;	/* Suggestion address */
	void *min;	/* Lowest acceptable address */
	void *max;	/* Maximum acceptable address */
};
... however, it seems like overkill to me.
