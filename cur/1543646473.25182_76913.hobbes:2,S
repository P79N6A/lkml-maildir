This check has been removed in 2.4 though. I think it was needed when we were trusting the structure count (see version 1.1 of dmidecode) instead of also verifying we weren't running of the table. Now that this check is done, I don't see why we would need the heuristic anymore.

I don't see how the check would protect us against anything. It only looks if the first char is a null byte or a white space. This is not very helpful, since on one hand such strings may be valid, and on the other hand invalid strings may pass the test.
Also note that the white spaces check has been removed from 2.4.

A better way IMHO would be to "secure" the dmi_string function. If we can ensure it will always return a safe (that is, null terminated) string, we are done. Agreed?
