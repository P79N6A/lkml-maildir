It's "hlaf guaranteed." It guarantees, that if data are delivered to the
reciever, all data sent before already arived and in correct order. But it's
not guaranteed that data succesuly writen on 1 end actualy arived unless the
connection was correctly shutdown and closed. 
Btw: can the aplication somehow ask the tcp/ip stack what was actualy acked?
(ie. how many bytes were acked).
