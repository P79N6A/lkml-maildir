I had MD5 in mind, sorry. I havent seen the SHA-1 colision samples, yet.
However it is likely to be available soon. (a simple pair with two files
will be enugh to cause "theoretical" problems. However I think it would be
possible to detect collisions on add and append sequence numbers... ugly.

Yes, I was referring to the longer versions (aka SHA-2), since FIPS tries to
phase out the 160bit version (till 2010).
Anyway I know we dont need to discuss this, I just wanted to point out that
in practical usage as source repository we might not see problems, but it
does not mean that there arent some already provokeable. PErsonally I see
the advantage of the "stateless" hash approach about more correct statefull
approaches like BK.
