Subject: Kernel bugs found using inspect tool

I ran the 2.3.38 distribution through a program from
the AT&T toolchest called 'inspect'.  I found 10 near-certain
bugs which may or may not be causing any observable problems
and 13 probable bugs which I couldn't immediately tell if they
were just odd coding style or real errors.  Most of the bugs
are in the drivers area which I guess is no suprise since these
drivers are less heavily travelled than the rest of the kernel.
I hope this is the right list to send this to.
