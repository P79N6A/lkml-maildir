The PnP card ID, with the USR0009 the PnP device ID; PnP cards can (and 
often do) have more than one device. For me, they are both the same:
$ cat /sys/devices/pnp1/01\:02/{card_,01\:02.00/}id
ETT0002
ETT0002
I do believe you need the device ID in 8250_pnp, but try the card ID 
when it doesn't work, I guess.

That they are found by 8250_pnp seems okay; onboard ports are normally 
PnP BIOS devices -- the devices in /sys/devices/pnp0. However, normally 
the BIOS will have enabled those ports itself meaning 8250 would pick 
them up already, so no, that's not standard.

Skipping that one. Maybe that will fix itself once you have the PnP ID 
listed.
