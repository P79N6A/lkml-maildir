Looks like mm's git-acpi.patch is missing a few things that are in the latest acpi tree.
Apparently I exposed this issue to Andrew before I exposed the fix, and he got the
former, but not the later -- my fault.
The root problem is that CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP is not set in defconfig,
and it is not set because CONFIG_SMP=y, but CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n
So tweaking that will get i386 and x86_64 building.  However, it will not fix ia64.
For that, the changes in the latest acpi tree are necessary.
Andrew, you want to re-pull the acpi tree, or do you want me to send
you some patches on top of the current mm?
