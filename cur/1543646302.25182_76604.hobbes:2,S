Did a pull from bkbits at 18:30 CET, something like 09:30 pacific I think.
In general.
I like where you are heading, both the make -f, but also the cleanup done
in the top-level Makefile.
It makes it much easier to integrate my (ours) new make clean stuff -
but that shall wait until this is in the kernel.
Comments looking at the two new csets:
1)
In the descend macro you test for
ifeq ($(KBUILD_VERBOSE),1)
To make it consistent I suggest to use
ifneq ($(KBUILD_VERBOSE),0)
As done earlier in the Makefile
2) Needed the following to make my kernel compile (make mrproper defconfig all)

Otherwise if failed first time it included modversions.h
3) This is just to make output nicer with KBUILD_VERBOSE=0
