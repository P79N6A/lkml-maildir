OK.  Re-enabling ACPI in the append statement and using "clock=tsc" works.  
The clock is as it should be.
I took a good look at the bios menus and there just isn't really anything 
there I can fiddle with:
ACPI OS Fast Post.........................[enable/disable]
Silent boot.....................................[enable/disable]
PnP OS..........................................[enable/disable]
That's it.  
Thanks for the help.
