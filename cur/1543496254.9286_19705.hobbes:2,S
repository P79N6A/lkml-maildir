A hash of wait queues will avoid the wait queues pollution in data
structures and using 1 spinlock per waitqueue will give more fine-grained
synchronisation than a single spin_lock for all wait_queue stuff.  (AFAIR,
such a solution is used in Mach)
The thing that seems still UNIXishly not enough is the sole 'event'
parameter. What I want to wait on is some event related to an instance of
something, and so I would expect as first step something like:
    may_wait(void *channel, int tag, etc ...)
On the other hand, the Linux mechanism that makes a process remove itself
from the wait queue is perhaps a good thing, so, something like the
following may be more Linux-ishly:) accepted. 
   may_wait(void *channel, int tag, wait_queue_link *wql, etc...)

Very probably.

The tlseep()/wakeup() thing needs the spl() to be implemented and seems
just loose for SMP, IMO.

The 2 steps solution is easily implementable in Linux, using an array of
Linuxish wait queues (and adding some fields in the task structure).  BTW,
It leads to constructs that looks like the ones we use to see in the Linux
kernel, minus the data structure pollution by wait queues, but a construct
like the following is perhaps easier to understand, at least for me: (The
name of datatype are not the ones used in the kernel)
wait_queue_link wql;
...
...
may_wait(chan, tag, &wql, flags, ...);
...
...
if (some_condition_is_true)
	do_wait(...);
else
	donnot_wait(&wql, ...);
Donnot know of Digital UNIX, but the construct you describe does not seem
to address SMP and looks a bit complex when we want to test the condition
atomically. 
In this situation, something as simple as the following:
      lock(&lock); 
      ...
      wait_locked(void *chan, int tag, lock_t *lock, ...);
should be enough and far simpler. (wait_locked() would be expected to
unlock the caller's 'lock' at a moment that prevents the caller from 
being stuck.
