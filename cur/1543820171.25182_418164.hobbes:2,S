And lo... within 10 hours a patch landed in my mailbox which did it all
properly. Now we have Kbuild files in each directory under include/
which list $(header-y) files for copying and $(unifdef-y) files which
need unifdef run on them. Thanks Arnd :)
This is in the git tree at
git://git.infradead.org/~dwmw2/headers-2.6.git
I'm going to stick that in a public directory and give group access to
it, and give out accounts to anyone who wants to assist. Although that
probably isn't necessary -- the individual header file cleanups can
probably go upstream directly rather than into this tree.
