Hi Pierre,
I've looked at the SD Card Association's SDIO Part E1 V2.00
specification concerning the Incrementing Address OP Code field for
CMD53.
The specification indicates that the START ADDRESS is inserted into the
Register Address register field. When the OP Code field has a value of 1
then the during the transfer the IO address is internally incremented
for each byte transferred. This applies to a single CMD53 command.
Looking at the implementation of sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() in sdio_io.c.
This function can send multiple CMD53 commands. My concern is that with
incrementing address mode selected the START ADDRESS is erroneously
changed for subsequent CMD53 commands in the while loop.
What I am trying to say is I don't believe the START ADDRESS should be
changed by the core driver when incrementing address mode is used. I
think incrementing address mode only applies internally to a single
CMD53 command. The SDIO card must physically have a suitable register
present at the START ADDRESS so changing this address to something
dependent on the data size is going to fail I think.
Do you have any evidence that any card drivers will use
sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() in a manner that needs the START ADDRESS to be
changed by the core driver ?
Regards,
Dean.
