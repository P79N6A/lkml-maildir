The real solution I think is for Linus to open up 2.5.  
If I remember correclty by the time that 2.2 was at 14, 2.3 was open.

Why not introduce a linux-2.4.xx-rc?
If there is no compile error or huge problem it will become linux-2.4.xx 
__without__ any change after 1 day.
If there is a problem, only a patch for this problem is applied. 
Just an idea
