It's almost always a bug to do spin_lock_irq() when local interrupts are
disabled.  However iirc when we've tried to add runtime debugging to catch
that, it triggered false-positives which made the idea unworkable.  I forget
where.
However what we could do is to add a new
spin_lock_irq_tell_me_if_i_goofed() which would perform that runtime check.
