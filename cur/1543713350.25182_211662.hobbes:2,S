This fixes a tiny race in the recent mprotect merging code, here's the
intradiff for review, plus it merges some nice lowlatency improvement
from Takashi.

I didn't yet merge the ppc patch because I'm not really sure it's
necessary (how can it not oops in the first place, if that patch was
needed? OTOH certainly that patch cannot hurt either but I'll wait
feedback from the testing first).  The only pending bug at the moment is
the gfp-no-compound related crash from Christoph on ppc showing
page->private corrupted. I currently doubt it's a bug in my changes,
though I cannot exclude it either. As soon as I get the results from the
three debugging patches I will know more about it. I definitely cannot
reproduce anything wrong here, and the gfp-no-compound fixed the last
swap-suspend related glitch plus it makes the interface with the drivers
more robust.

Changelog diff between 2.6.5-rc3-aa3 and 2.6.5-aa1:
Files 2.6.5-rc3-aa3/disable-cap-mlock and 2.6.5-aa1/disable-cap-mlock differ
Files 2.6.5-rc3-aa3/extraversion and 2.6.5-aa1/extraversion differ
Files 2.6.5-rc3-aa3/prio-tree.gz and 2.6.5-aa1/prio-tree.gz differ
	Rediffed due rejects.
Files 2.6.5-rc3-aa3/mprotect-vma-merging and 2.6.5-aa1/mprotect-vma-merging differ
	Fixed race condition in mprotect, must hold the anon_vma_lock()
	while moving either ->vm_start or ->vm_pgoff (extending the vm_end
	doesn't need it instead since the race is controlled w/o explicit
	locking).
Only in 2.6.5-aa1: unmap_vmas-lat
	Don't threat no-preempt differently from -preempt w.r.t. worst case
	latencies.
Only in 2.6.5-aa1: writeback-lat
	Merged Takashi Iwai's lowlatency fixes adding missing schedule points,
	reducing greatly the worst case latency with preempt disabled.
