Hmm...
     scsi0 : Adaptec AHA274x/284x/294x (EISA/VLB/PCI-Fast SCSI)
     5.1.31/3.2.4
            <Adaptec AIC-7899 Ultra 160/m SCSI host adapter>
     Vendor: QUANTUM   Model: ATLAS10K2-TY092L  Rev: DA40
       Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 03
     /dev/sda:
      Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.59 seconds =40.25 MB/sec
They can do more like 40MB/s, so only two disks could saturate the 80MB/s.
This is in a Dell Precision 620.
