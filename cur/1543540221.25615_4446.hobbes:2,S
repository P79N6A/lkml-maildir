	I am trying to think how a newcomer will browse sample
	systems, and wonder why some subsystem release() methods
	have those locks, and others don't...  "Are there bugs ??"
	So perhaps:
	/* this is so trivial we don't need to lock_kernel() here */
	comment is what is needed at those places so that it will
	satisfy also the newcomers coming latter to wonder it..
