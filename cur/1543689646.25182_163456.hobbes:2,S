64B is the minimum ETHERNET frame size.  That isn't true for PPP, HDLC,
Frame relay, ATM, etc.

Sure it can.  Yeah, it'll be slow_er_, but not stopped.  CEF/PXF doesn't
require much CPU to switch a packet.
At process switching, the router is rated to a few K pps.  Process switching
SUCKS.
I've seen a 7206/200 _attempt_ to move 150kpps @ 64B each. (misbehaving
software and a misconfigured firewall...) The router was chuggin' right
along -- discarding UDP traffic like a mad man.  From the console, it was
working fine. *grin* It's rather hard for telnet to compete (and even
harder for ssh.)
All those machines are behind a 7401 now.  And it doesn't even blink at
such things.  (That thing's worth every penny we paid for it.)
