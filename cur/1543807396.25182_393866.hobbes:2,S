Quoting David Brownell (david-b@pacbell.net):

The first one would be useless - I inserted lots of printouts to find
out where the freeze took place, and I know that the 
EHCI_USBLEGSUP_BIOS flag is on (cap is 0x10001). The value remains the
same after the 'spin till it hands it over' loop - so that this
printout appears:
0000:00:13.2 EHCI: BIOS handoff failed (BIOS bug ?)
About the second thing you suggest: do you refer to this call?
			/* just in case, always disable EHCI SMIs */
			pci_write_config_dword(pdev,
					offset + EHCI_USBLEGCTLSTS,
					0);
In my machine, the write takes place without apparent ill effects. If
I add it as an else clause to the "if LEGSUP_BIOS" test, it won't
execute, because the EHCI_USBLEGSUP_BIOS flag is on.
In case you need it: hcc_params is 0xa012.
