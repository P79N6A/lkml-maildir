Well, the move to HZ=1000 from HZ=100 was wanted to improve latency
requirements, so I don't know if folks would go for something like
HZ=519. The lost tick issue is a problem, but the real solution there is
to move the time subsystem away from depending on timer interrupts to
keep accurate time. See the proposal I just sent out for more details.
That way timer interrupts just become scheduler preemption points and
lost ticks become just an issue for folks with latency requirements.

Indeed, having alternate or multiple timer interrupt sources would be
nice. Hopefully once the time of day subsystem is untangled from the
timer subsystem, using alternate interrupt sources will be much easier
(and cleaner!).
