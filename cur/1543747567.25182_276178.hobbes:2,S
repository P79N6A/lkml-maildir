I'm not knowledgable enough to read the trace, but what was for example
the last thing qsynth was doing? Did it go to sleep? I suppose this was
Rui's 9 qsynth's test, right?
Hmm, i wonder if there's a way to detect non RT behaviour in jackd
clients. I mean AFAIK the only thing allowed for the process callback of
on is the FIFO it waits on to be woken, right? Every other sleeping is
to be considered a bug.

For this test i used jackd from yesterdays CVS. With the 0.99 version i
think i saw more of these xruns, but cannot tell (still running the CVS
version right now).. They all had in common though that they are in the
0.020-0.040msec range.
