Hi all,
I've recently discovered that I could run Linux on an iPod
(
http://ipodlinux.org/
). The problem is that they seems to use an old
version of the uclinux kernel (2.4.x serie) adapted for the PP500x/PP502x.
I have few questions about this:
1) I tried to look how to configure a kernel (through menuconfig) to get
access to non-MMU able CPUs, but I failed. What is the trick ? :)
2) The PP500x/PP502x chipset serie seems to be a dual-ARM7, is there any
plan to support this architecture (even something experimental could fit
to me).
That's all folks
