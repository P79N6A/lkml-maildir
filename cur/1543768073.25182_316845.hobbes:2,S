Well you can do that all from userspace basically.
At least you should be able to do it as well as you can from
kernel (providing you have a syscall/device to retrieve events).

They won't change *much*. Nothing that is detectable from userspace
(except for perhaps /proc entries).

Well it is a bit difficult to help further because you haven't posted
the working code or said what you are trying to do.
Stick a few printks around the place or try a kernel debugger to see
if you can't work out what is going wrong. Compiling the kernel with
debug info can allow you to find out what line of code EIP is pointing
to, which can also be helpful.
