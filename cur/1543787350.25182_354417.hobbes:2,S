The core problem is that a SAM-friendly path to SAS has already been 
chosen -- transport classes -- and your driver isn't following this path.
If we choose a new path every six months, we'll never arrive at the 
destination.

Linux today is the most successful its ever been.  This system, however 
strange it may seem, does work.

The rest of the Linux-SCSI devs are trying to make it less SPI-centric. 
  Rather than just complain, we're doing something about it.

Background is irrelevant.  Only results matter.  Linux is a meritocracy.

Spare me your paranoia.  I've been 100% honest with you in every email 
I've written.
You -should- change other people's code.  That's how Linux gets better.
When I chose a better path for libata's error handling, the first step 
in that process was changing the locking, and modifying almost every 
$!#$@! SCSI driver in the kernel.  Rather than forever complaining about 
an outdated SCSI layer, I stepped up and fixed things.

SCSI work is speeding up.  The SCSI core has come a -long- way in the 
past couple years.  2.6.x SCSI is light years ahead of 2.4.x SCSI.
