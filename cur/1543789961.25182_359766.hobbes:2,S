Oh you don't need namespaces to hork mtab.  Do a mount from a chroot 
environment.  Or try to use --bind or --move mounts (at all) and watch it beg 
for mercy.  (I accidentally ran UserMode Linux as root once, using a hostfs 
root filesystem to borrow the existing Linux's root filesystem, and its' 
mounts edited the parent system's /etc/mtab.  Yeah, that was user error on my 
part, but it's also the _only_ gotcha I've found when doing that.)
/etc/mtab is simply brittle.  Personally, on systems I build, I ln 
-s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab
