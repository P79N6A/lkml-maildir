Almost making it to your go-live date, only to have everything come

I believe you, that was my next thought, but I didn't know if that would
really help just to be honest. Thanks for the input there. 
I've been going crazy trying to catch any piece of sanity out of this
thing to understand if this was what was happening or not. I feel a bit
dumb for not trying serial console yet, but I knew either that or KDB
should tell us something. I will see what we can do, it will take less
time to do this, than to reload everything all over again.
Should I remove LVM all together, or just not use it? In your opinion.
