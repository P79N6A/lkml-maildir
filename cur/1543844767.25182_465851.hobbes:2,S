Hello Jamal,

The main intention for this driver was not only to provide Ethernet over
IPv4 tunneling. This is also possible in userspace using a tap interface
(as Jan-Benedict Glaw mentioned). Another main intention for this driver
was to provide tunneling of Ethernet packets using the EtherIP protocol.

You are right. I completly agree with this. But this is also true for
the IPIP and the SIT driver. You can do both with GRE. And there are
reasons to keep both in the Kernel.

At the moment I know at least that at least OpenBSD, NetBSD and FreeBSD
support the EtherIP protocol. The first of them was OpenBSD, thats
right. I don't think OpenBSD made a wrong implementation at this point
(I assume you are speaking of the position of the 3 in the header). The
RFC is not clear at this point. It defines that the first 4 bits in the
16 bit Ethernet header MUST be 0011. But it don't defines the
byteorder of that 16 bit word nor if the least or most significant bit
comes first. This was the reason (to keep interoperability with the
existing implementations) I implemented it the same way as OpenBSD and
my driver does not check the incoming EtherIP header.
> I am actually curious if anyone uses it instead of GRE in openbsd?
When I searched Google for EtherIP I found some entries in BSD forums
discussing questions concering EtherIP usage. This, and the fact I know
a BSD user that uses EtherIP too, makes be believe there are numerous
users of EtherIP in the BSD world. And at least the BSD user I know
wants interoperability of his NetBSD implemenation with Linux. This
request was the starting point for this driver.

I am not a friend of censorship. I think the users should have the
freedom to decide what they want to use. There are reasons to have more
than one way to tunnel Ethernet packets in the Kernel (the reason for
EtherIP is the interoperability with the BSD implementations). I don't
know if the GRE driver in mainline already support Ethernet tunneling.
But if not, my driver is already the second way to do it (after the tap
devices).

Surely not. I intend to further contribute even if this driver would be
finally rejected :)
