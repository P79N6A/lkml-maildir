No -- I meant only 0xe8 0x07 and 0xe8 0x06 . For those it doesn't matter
if you repeat the parameter or send something else. The answers from the
device for those command/parameters are always the same.

OK -- I will send the command after 0xe8 0x07 twice.

You mean if the device is in the appropriate DMI-database use the
lifebook protocol and if the parameter is provided use it also (although
it might not be in the DMI database)?

No idea yet -- I will test this.

Ah OK. 
I personally never used an external mouse. But last weekend I played
around a little bit and recognized that there are some BIOS-settings
which control the behavior of the touchscreen, quickpoint-device and
external mouse. I have to play around with those a little bit more. But
as far as I can see you can never have all three at the same time.
