Or perhaps we should just teach everyone to always run tcpdump
with -p, like me :)
Of course this would still have a negative impact on those who
have to be in promiscuous mode all the time (heh) due to multiple
unicast MAC addresses and such.  However, we should able to
communicate that fact to the driver and the driver can then elect
to not disable VLAN acceleration unless we really want to be in
promiscuous mode.
In other words we can make it so that nobody is in promiscuous
mode and therefore have to disable VLAN acceleration *unless*
they really want to be in that state.  In which case it would
imply that they wish to see everything and therefore we should
disable VLAN acceleration.
So that means I'd like to see our current core/driver interface
enhanced so that whether the user has requested us to be in
promiscuous mode can be differentiated from whether the network
stack wants us to be.
Once we have that then I would think that such a patch would be
less controversial.
Cheers,
