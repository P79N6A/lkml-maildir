I have the same problem with reports. I'm not talking about -rc*, that
is fine, I know that a report against rc-* means and most user will usually
tell me rc*-bk* so that's ok.
The problem is just with this intermediate state between 2.6.N "final" and
whatever gets next until we go to -rc. The fact that it has the exact same
version as 2.6.N final means that I get confusing reports (and, but I know
you don't care about modules, but it's simply impossible to have both
the "final" modules and the "current top of tree" modules installed at the
same time, which _is_ painful).
When I was still doing my "pmac" tree, what I would do was to put -pre0
in the EXTRAVERSION after a release until I got to -preX or -rcX...
Anyway, it's your call.
Ben.
