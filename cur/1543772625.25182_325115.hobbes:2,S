yes, this would be the right approach. Note that we already do something 
like that in the per_cpu_locked API, we hide a spinlock there, which 
gets turned off for !PREEMPT_RT. For local_irq_disable() replacements 
we'd need a separate API.
(one thing to watch out for are smp_call_function() handlers. These 
still execute in hardirq context even on PREEMPT_RT. E.g. in buffer.c 
you'll see such code.)
