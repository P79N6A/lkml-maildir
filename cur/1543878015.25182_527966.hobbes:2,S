Hi Peter,
You say that the results may be accurate, but not relevant.
.-------------------------.
| FILESYSTEM | TIME |DISK |
| TYPE       |(secs)|USAGE|
.-------------------------.
|REISER4 lzo | 1938 | 278 |
|REISER4 gzip| 2295 | 213 |
|REISER4     | 3462 | 692 |
|EXT2        | 4092 | 816 |
|JFS         | 4225 | 806 |
|EXT4        | 4408 | 816 |
|EXT3        | 4421 | 816 |
|XFS         | 4625 | 779 |
|REISER3     | 6178 | 793 |
|FAT32       |12342 | 988 |
|NTFS-3g     |10414 | 772 |

If they are accurate,.... THEN they are obviously very relevant.
Trying to follow

I have set up a Reiser4 partition with gzip compression, here is the
difference in disk usage of a typical Debian installation on two 10GB
partitions, one with Reiser3 and the other with Reiser4.
debian:/# df
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda3             10490104   6379164   4110940  61% /3
/dev/sda7              9967960   2632488   7335472  27% /7
Partitions 3 and 7 have exactly the same data on them (the typical
Debian install).
The partitions are exactly the same size (although df records different
sizes).
Partition 3 is Reiser3 -- uses 6.4 GB.
Partition 7 is Reiser4 -- uses 2.6 GB.
So Reiser4 uses 2.6 GB to store the (typical) data that it takes Reiser3
6.4 GB to store (note it would take ext2/3/4 some 7 GB to store the same
info).
This seems very relevant to me.
John.
