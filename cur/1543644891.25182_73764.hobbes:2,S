Hi Andrew,
Updated 2.5.38 RCU core and dcache_rcu patches are now available
at 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8875&release_id=112473
The differences since earlier versions are -
rcu_ltimer - call_rcu() fixed for preemption and the earlier fix I had sent
             to you.
read_barrier_depends - fixes list_for_each_rcu macro compilation error.
dcache_rcu - uses list_add_rcu in d_rehash and list_for_each_rcu in d_lookup
             making the read_barrier_depends() fix I had sent to you
             earlier unnecessary.
Thanks
