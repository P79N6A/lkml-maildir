Subject: [PATCH 04/37] Hibernation: Correct definitions of some ioctls (rev. 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/31/567

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Three ioctl numbers belonging to the hibernation userland interface,
SNAPSHOT_ATOMIC_SNAPSHOT, SNAPSHOT_AVAIL_SWAP, SNAPSHOT_GET_SWAP_PAGE,
are defined in a wrong way (eg. not portable).  Provide new ioctl numbers for
these ioctls and mark the existing ones as deprecated.
