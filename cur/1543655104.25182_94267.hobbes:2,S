Subject: X locks console using /dev/null as core pointer

Starting X with /dev/null configured as a PS/2 mouse locks the
console.
Killing X from a serial terminal didn't fix the console - not even
numlock was working.
I guess this is really an X bug, but should it lock the console hard,
so that it's not even possible to switch VTs?
John.
