Ingo as long as you freely mix algorithmic and code complexity we won't 
get very far. I did code size comparisons for your _stable_ code, which 
was merged into Linus' tree. I explicitly said that my patch is only a 
prototype, so I haven't done any cleanups and tuning in this direction 
yet, so making any conclusions based on code size comparisions is quite 
ridiculous at this point.
The whole point of this patch was to demonstrate the algorithmic changes, 
not to demonstrate a final and perfectly tuned scheduler.

I'll look into it next week.
