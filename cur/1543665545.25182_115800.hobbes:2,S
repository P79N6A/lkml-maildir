1) As far as I understand, duplicates are possible even in classic ext2
   w/o sortdir/index. See the diagram:
                    Process 1                  Process 2
                    getdents(2) returns
                    dentry1 (file1 -> Inode1)
                    dentry2 (file2 -> Inode2)
context switch -->
                                               unlink(file1), empty dentry1
                                               creat(file3), Inode3, use dentry1
                                               creat(file1), Inode1, use dentry3
context switch -->
                    getdents(2) returns
                    dentry3(file1 -> Inode1)
Am I right?
2) Why do not use hash order for traversal like ext3_dx_readdir() does?
   Upon reading several dentries within some hash set readdir() sorts them
   in inode order and returns to an user.
with best regards, Alex
