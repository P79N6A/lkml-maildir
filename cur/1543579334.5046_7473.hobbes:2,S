"really stupid" is probably too harsh in both cases...
Anyways, he has a point here: clarity. When doing late night debugging,
your eyes are not going to be fooled as easily if the result of the
condition is braced. Whether you consider it important is a personal
taste, but it is also consistent with multi-line if statements, and when
rapidly scanning code consistency is very useful.
The rest of it, I generally agree with, except I like perl. :o) But,
just like working for a company, you follow the standards for the system
you're working on.

P.S. What's wrong with perl? Very useful language IMHO.
