Pabel, can you detail more exactly which kernels don't work, and which do?
From bugzilla:
 - 2.6.18.x does work
 - 2.6.19.2 doesn't work.
 - what about plain 2.6.19?
 - can you please test some of the 2.6.19-rcX kernels? Especially 
   2.6.19-rc1 would be good to test.
Since it apparently already happens in 2.6.19 (but it would be really good 
to know exactly when it starts), and considering _where_ it happens, I'd 
be inclined to blame commit d2e7b7d0: "fix potential stack overflow in 
mm/slab.c" by Suresh. 
When do_tune_cpucache() is called at bootup, I'm not sure how safe it is 
to do the kzalloc() thing.
I've added a number of hopefully appropriate people to the Cc. Guys? 
Apparently it only happens with MEMORY_HOTPLUG (and possibly with just an 
SMP kernel on UP), which probably explains why it's been around without 
people really complaining very loudly.
