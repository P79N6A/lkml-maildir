Or, it's probably a real problem.  The asm-offsets.h file
has a long history of being a thorn in the side of Makefiles,
including race conditions (such as you saw with -j4).  There
is a natural circular dependency in the construction of the
asm-offsets.h file and the rest of the build that's tricky
to get right.
Whether or not someone sees enough evidence yet to deal with
this instance of that breakage ... that's another matter.
Often this kind of breakage remains until someone with the
right mental weapons gets bit by it, and goes hunting it down.
