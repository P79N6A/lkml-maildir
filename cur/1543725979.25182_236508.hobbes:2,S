Hello,
I'am running hfsc qdisc with huge set of rules loaded.
root@hades:/home/system/scr/etc/hfsc_rebuild# cat tc.batch | grep hfsc | wc -l
  27884
Always when I delete the root qdisc (qdisc del dev eth0 root)
the machine stop responding for about 5-6 seconds. As I think it's due the
hfsc_destory_qdisc is executed in main kernel thread. Similar problem is
present also in htb scheduler.
Is there any quick solution to solve this problem ?
