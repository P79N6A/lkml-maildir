| Cyrill,
| 
| randconfig testing in x86.git found a build bug and i bisected it to 
| your patch - output is below. Config attached. Looks like some config 
| file dependency hell problem? The dependencies there definitely need a 
| good look and a handful of cleanups as well.

Argh! Ingo, it seems that the real problem was introdused by
commit 8fc37f2c474b8ea61186fd77193324845432447b

    x86: merge ptrace_32/64.h

with this patch we have <asm/vm86.h> included only
if __i386__ defined *BUT* X86_VM_MASK is tried to be
used *without* __386__ being checked (as example - ptrace.h:user_mode_vm).
I'm not sure how to properly hanle this situation. But will take a look.
So I suggest you drop my last patch (which moves X86_VM_MASK
into __KERNEL__ section) for a while. I'll recheck all
this stuff later (too busy now).
