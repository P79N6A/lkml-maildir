Hi Pavel
I've been playing with hooking in the post resume swap prefetch code into 
swsusp_suspend and just started noting this on 2.6.16-rc6-mm1:
During the _suspend_ to disk cycle on this machine the swsusp_suspend function 
appears to continue beyond swsusp_arch_suspend as I get the same messages 
that I would normally get during a resume cycle such as this:
Suspending device platform
swsusp: Need to copy 14852 pages
Intel machine check architecture supported.
Intel machine check reporting enabled on CPU#0
and...
eth1: Coming out of suspend...
and so on
but then it manages to write to disk and power down anyway. Is this correct? 
If I put post_resume_swap_prefetch at the end of swsusp_suspend it hits that 
function on both resume _and_ suspend cycles. Am I missing something?
Cheers,
Con
