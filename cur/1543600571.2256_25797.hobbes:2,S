Heh.  "No time."  Sounds familiar.  :)
I don't have the knoff-hoff (know-how) either, but I'd like
  to know what models you have info on.  I'd be very interested
  in any documentation you might have on the Satellite 1605CDS.
  At the very least, I like to collect info so that it's available
  later on.
I have DMA enabled on my Satellite 1605CDS, but only via a hack.
  If I enable ALi 15xx support in the kernel, I find that I can't
  suspend my laptop to disk (it hands off to BIOS well, but then
  BIOS freezes when it starts to save the "Extended" memory.)
  So, what I do is build an ALi-enabled kernel, then reboot to
  a non-ALi-enabled kernel.  For some reason, it saves this
  DMA-enabled info between soft reboots.  So, since it's Linux
  and I essentially never have to hard-reboot (or even give it
  the 3-finger salute) this works fairly well.  It's only when
  it's actually been shut off or hard rebooted (via the switch)
  that DMA gets disabled again.
I'd like to fix the ALi support so I can suspend to disk, but I
  don't know where to begin.  I don't have the specs.
Where did you get this info?  I'd be very curious what else we
  can get out.
