While cleaning up the DocBook makefile I have seen the following errormessage
as produced by scripts/kernel-doc:
Use of uninitialized value in string ne at scripts/kernel-doc line 641, <IN> line 247.
Use of uninitialized value in string ne at scripts/kernel-doc line 661, <IN> line 247.
Use of uninitialized value in join or string at scripts/kernel-doc line 363, <IN> line 247.
Any brave perl guru that is able to hack kernel-doc to at least provide
a filename, to give a hint where to search?
Obviously a better approach would be to fix this error in kernel-doc.
The above output can be reproduced by the following command:
src/linux$ scripts/kernel-doc -docbook include/linux/skbuff.h > x
