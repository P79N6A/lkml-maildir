Sorry, my fault - I confused used and unused.

But this point still stands:
If we don't want any warnings with CONFIG_PCI=n, CONFIG_SYSFS=n or
CONFIG_PROC_FS=n, we'd have to annotate _many_ functions.
If the lonterm goal is to compile the kernel with -Werror then we need 
-Wno-unused-function, not annotating individual functions.
