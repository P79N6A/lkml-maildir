OK, I can't reproduce it.  I was thinking some weird corner case
with not restoring the string in parse_args, but putting in a dummy
"mem" core_param() on x86 works as first, middle and last arg on cmdline,
and command line shows up correctly in /proc/cmdline.
Any chance I can ask you to verify that?  Is the commandline printk'd
on boot also wrong?
Thanks,
Rusty.
