Subject: [PATCH] 2.3.18: siginfo data available for all signals
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/9/14/135

Normally only real-time signals have siginfo data. However it is also
useful for other signals as well. Some of the other signals would like to
carry extra information, but that information is lost currently.
This patch handles all signals alike. Every signal is put into the signal
queue. Only real-time signals are queued multiple times. Other signals can
have only one siginfo in the queue.
The patch also fixes some unitialized data being passed to user space
under some circumstances. When sending a signal using kill, the siginfo
structure on the stack was not zeroed.
For some reason magic values for siginfo were passed to send_sig_info.
These magic values are transformed to normal pointers to a struct siginfo,
so that the rest of the code does not have to handle these special values.
This simplifies the rest of the code somewhat.
Any comments?
The last few times I have sent in this patch I have received zero reactions. On
the other hand the patch does not seem to make it into kernels. Something must
be wrong, however I don't know what it is.
