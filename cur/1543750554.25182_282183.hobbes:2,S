Building 2.6.10 for sh results in inconsistent kallsyms data. Turning on
CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL fixes it, as does CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS.
The symbols that seem to be problematic between the second and third
pass are all kallsyms special symbols. With only CONFIG_KALLSYMS set we
see:

So for some reason we have a 0x70 variance between these, and only
these. Running with --all-symbols this seems to work fine.
Looking at scripts/kallsyms.c:symbol_valid, we see:
/* Symbols which vary between passes.  Passes 1 and 2 must have
 * identical symbol lists.  The kallsyms_* symbols below are only added
 * after pass 1, they would be included in pass 2 when --all-symbols is
 * specified so exclude them to get a stable symbol list.
 */
Going by this it's not entirely clear if there is a problem or not. If
these symbols are supposed to be excluded due to being "special", then
it doesn't seem like verify_kallsyms in the top-level Makefile is doing
the right thing by just doing a blind cmp -s. This comment also seems to
be a bit outdated or just generally inaccurate, as --all-symbols isn't
the default behaviour unless CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL is set.
