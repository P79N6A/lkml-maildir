I'm just trying to get us back to a productive topic.

DHCP, tcpdump,..  Probably a bad way of phrasing it.  But there
is a lot more that we can do using a pure layer 2 approach.

As I replied earlier it isn't a problem.  If you get to it through the
filesystem namespace it uses the network namespace it was mounted with
for it's connection.

See above.

Grr.  I put that badly.  Basically at least on the slow path you need to
look at a per network namespace data structure.  The extra pointer
indirection could slow things down.  The point is that we may be
able to have a fast path that is exactly the same as the rest
of the network stack.
If the obvious approach does not work my gut the feeling the
network stack fast path will give us an implementation without overhead.

So far.

How so?  As far as I can tell this is a basic requirement to get
merged.

This subthread talking about devices showing up in multiple namespaces seemed
 very much exactly on how network devices show up.

I believe I addressed Herbert Poetzl's concerns earlier.  To me the question
is can we implement an acceptable layer 2 solution, that distrubutions and
other people who do not need isolation would have no problem compiling in
by default.
The joy of namespaces is that if you don't want it you don't have to use it.
Layer 2 can do everything and is likely usable by everyone iff the performance
is acceptable.

Sorry.  More than anything those questions looked retorical and aimed
at disarming some of the silliness.  I will go back and try and
answer those.  Fundamentally when we have one namespace that includes
network devices, network sockets, and all of the data structures necessary
to use them (routing tables and the like) and we have a tunnel device
that can connect namespaces the answers are trivial and I though obvious.
