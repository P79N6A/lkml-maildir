Hi,
    While writing kernel code what is the correct way to find out if the
kernel is being compiled with frame pointer?
Is the following code correct?
#ifdef CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER 
	code assuming frame pointer
#else
	code assuming no frame pointer  
The top level Makefile that comes with the standard kernels (the ones
which can be downloaded from kernel.org etc.) adds -fomit-frame-pointer to
CFLAGS by default and it does not have something like
ifdef CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
CFLAGS += -fomit-frame-pointer
endif
Is CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER a part of some external patch?
If yes, then is there a way to find the above in the standard
kernels?
What about CONFIG_KDB_FRAMEPTR? Is it correct to use this in a standard
kernel to find whether the kernel is being compiled with frame pointer?
Thanks and Regards,
Sushil.
