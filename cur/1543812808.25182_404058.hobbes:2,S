Hi all,
I got UBIQUAM UM-300 PCMCIA Type II Card
http://www.ubiquam.com/product/da_um300.php
Socket 0:
  product info: "Ubiquam", "UM-300", "", ""
  manfid: 0x015d, 0x4c45
  function: 254 ((null))
I tried bind it to serial_cs driver, but without success:
PCMCIA_DEVICE_MANF_CARD(0x015d, 0x4c45),
After this addition I got:
pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 0
pcmcia: registering new device pcmcia0.0
pcmcia: registering new device pcmcia0.1
0.1: ttyS2 at I/O 0x3e8 (irq = 10) is a XScale
But when I tried talk to it I got:
serial8250: too much work for irq10
serial8250: too much work for irq10
serial8250: too much work for irq10
serial8250: too much work for irq10
serial8250: too much work for irq10
Any clue?
Thanks and regards
Michal
