First of all I would like to say thanks to everyone.
I didn't expect so many answer in so few time ( I got
most of them directly in my mailbox)
Anyway I've ordered right now the D-Link DFE-570 that
seems the one with the best price/quality ratio so I
can test it on the "battle field".
Best Regards
Fabio
