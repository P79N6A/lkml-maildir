Yes, this driver does have issues on ppc, see the archives for Anton
trying to fix it up to get it to build.  But as ppc currently doesn't
_have_ pci express hotplug hardware it really doesn't matter much :)

No, look up a bit higher:
	obj-$(CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE)          += pciehp.o
which will build pciehp or not.  Just don't enable the option for now
on ppc please.  Until people sanitize the ACPI headers for non-acpi
arches (which is currently underway...)
