	The idea is *predictability*.  Guarantees of behavior.  Your user
deamon is fine for many cases, but it's execution is not deterministic.  
What's in the config files may or may not represent what is in memory (assuming
it can be sent a HUP to reread).  It may be paged out to disk or even in
memory -- may get insufficient priority if real-time processes have priority.
	If I'm running as an end user -- you would expect me to go read
the memory priority policy of the 'hour' to know how my programs will behave?
That's not acceptable -- and it is even questionable whether or not on a 
secure system you'd want to make that information readable by all.  On
a timeshare system at UCSB, it can make sense to have some sludge'n'fudge
on how this topic is handled.  On a secure/mission critical system you need
the ability to have high integrity, easily predictable systems.  Complexity
while perhaps proportional to usefulness is inversely proportional to
integrity.
	You do the user-space demon -- it's a great idea.  But let's also
agree to implement the vswap idea to allow overcommit or not.   That way
you can have the behavior you want, and I can have the behavior I *need* 
and we can both have a 'win-win' situation....?  No?  Just like for the 2.3
series you have to add a 'shm' entry to continue to use shared memory, in
2.5 somewhere, you can just add a 'vswap' entry to continue to do overcommit.
