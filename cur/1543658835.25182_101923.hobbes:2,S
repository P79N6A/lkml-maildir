Long answer: The network driver authors are doing some fairly clever
things to make old ISA adapters usable in Linux 2.4 and later. Linux
lacks the functionality to do 
	spin_lock_disable_irqmask(lock, flags, mask)
Implementing it is rather expensive and hard to do well. In general
those code paths need reviewing and probably to change to
	preempt_disable()
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	spin_lock_irqsave(..)
#endif
..
Please ensure that if you change these drivers you 
a) Have the hardware and test it uniprocessor and SMP
b) Verify that with your change a serial modem port still works
c) Understand the game the author is playing
(Also d) ensure the author understands the games she/he is playing too!)
If you've been looking at the etherleak stuff btw, the -ac tree has what
is theoretically a full set of fixes. I'd love someone who is looking
at this into 2.5 to review them and merge them into the 2.5 tree. I 
doubt I have them all right so more eyes is most welcome.
