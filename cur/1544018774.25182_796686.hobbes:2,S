Hi Rusty,
I've been running module reference counts as atomic_t on my desktop
(x86_64 AMD X2) all week and haven't been able to measure any
significant performance differences. I guess more cpus & server
workloads could show up something, but I don't have access to that sort
of hardware.
The one issue I am seeing is with my simple test harness, which is just
a very basic socket client/server. With the existing ref counting code,
when running several copies of the client I sometimes get EADDRNOTAVAIL
(-99) errors on socket connect(). But I don't see any errors with the
atomic_t ref counting. 
I'm still trying to debug this, but I haven't yet found where in the
network stack these errors are coming from. 
regards
Richard
