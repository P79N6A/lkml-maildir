It is (normally) called twice in SendReceive(). SendReceive() is called
very often in cifs. After a quick look at cifs, it seems that most of
these calls are protected with a per connection-lock (correct me if I'm
wrong). But since two connections can call SendReceive() at the same
time, we have to protect the tfm with locks. Correct?
Would a better solution be to allocate one tfm per connection, thus
no need to protect the tfm with a dedicated lock, right?
[Or is converting cifs to the cryptoapi is waste of time? (I hope not :-) ]
