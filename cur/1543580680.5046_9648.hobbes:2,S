Linus,
There is a significative amount of people who use sard's additional block
layer statistics (I'm one of them). It would be nice to have it in the
official free.
The available sard code is not optional, which I believe is a valid reason
for not merging it in.
If so, I can make it optional and documented in Configure.help so the
this problem is gone.
Any other reason why you would not merge it in the official tree ?
If no, I can send you the proposed patch.
