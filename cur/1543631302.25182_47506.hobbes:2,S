Ahhh and just another note - we are talking about a property of a
*device* not a property of the kernel - so ioctl (read io as device)
and certainly not sysctl (read sys as kernel).
What could be sonsidered as an *serious* alternative would
be to abstract it out even further and implement it on
the tset (terminal settings) levels. But *certainly* not sysctl.
