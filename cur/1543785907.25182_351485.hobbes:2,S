I just tried a simple test - I created a program that allocated a
hugetlb page and wrote some stuff in it. I then attached with gdb and
dumped memory at that address and things came out OK.
That should have exercised the ptrace -> access_process_vm -> get_user_pages
path. So at least for this case get_user_pages seems to be working :)
It would be useful to simplify your problem a bit and take DMA out of
the picture. Moving this over to linuxppc64-dev@ozlabs.org would also
make sense.
