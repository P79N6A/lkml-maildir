Will try that out. For now I tried -rc4 and couple other things - removing 
nvidia module doesnt make any difference but removing ndiswrapper and with no 
networking the slab growth stops. With 8139too driver and network the growth 
is there but pretty slower than with ndiswrapper. With 8139too + some network 
activity slab seems to reduce sometimes.
Seems either an ndiswrapper or a networking related leak. Will report the 
results with Manfred's patch tomorrow.
Thanks
