In fact, they all do:
struct inode_operations ext2_file_inode_operations;
struct inode_operations ext2_dir_inode_operations;
struct inode_operations ext2_special_inode_operations;
struct inode_operations ext2_symlink_inode_operations;
struct inode_operations ext2_fast_symlink_inode_operations;
As you see, ext2 code already has multiple file "plugins", with
persistent "plugin id" (stored in i_mode field of on-disk struct
ext2_inode).
