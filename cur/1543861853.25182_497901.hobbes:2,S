I am a Linux user/developer in all my IT career which began in 1997.
But always my goal to be a kernel developer and a contributor after
getting hardened. But my career didn't allow me to do this LKML work
except regular reading (frequent change of projects & skills in
Telecom/Embedded). Since last year am with Big B (don't want to name
my company here. Because many people on this list are from the same
company, might get offended because of my novice questions. Or, They
might see me as a silly guy!)
But my interest reached to impossible level to hold anymore. From now
on I want to be an active contributer among this great community :)
Sorry for this big rant. These kernels I test would be for my
Workstations/Embedded  boards (ARM & Power) at my home & my Labs
(example ThinkCentre A51). Not for any production Servers as of now.

I did start involving with LKML & posted a few too. But, I didn't get
any pointer from you guys.

Maybe I did something naive or stupid in the effort above or in the
posting here. Dunno!

Just now compiled 2.6.20-rc4 too.  So I have already started the
