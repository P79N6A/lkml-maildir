	Not just substantial parts, but substantial *creative* (as opposed to
functional) parts. Furthermore, are those parts combined with the work in a
*creative* way. (Otherwise you have two works in aggregate form, not a
single derived work.)
	I would argue that linking creates aggregate works just as tar does. The
key *legal* issue is whether the combination is mechanical or creative.

	I think that argument would fail anyway. It would require you to argue that
making an actual loadable module from the Linux kernel source and its header
files was not the normal use of those header files. I think that argument
would fail the giggle test.
	RedHat, for example, distributes a 'kernel-devel' package whose primary
purpose is to allow you to turn module source code into module executables.
Since you have the right to normal use without agreeing to the GPL (under at
least first sale), you can *create* those binary modules without agreeing to
the GPL. Remember, there is no right under copyright to specifically
restrict the *distribution* of derivative works, it relies upon you needing
the GPL to give you the right to make the derived work in the first place.
