Well I'm baffled. There's basically two things in that function that
do anything interesting: pfn_to_page and put_user. access_ok is
"return 1" on Sparc64. atomic_read is a simple read.
My usual approach at this point would be to litter it with printks and
see where its hanging.
But as the function doesn't actually show up in your stack trace,
something else is probably wrong. So I'd also try commenting out
pieces of that function until it started working.
