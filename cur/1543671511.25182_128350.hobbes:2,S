Any 32-bit x86 kernel should work on an AMD Opteron machine.  The only
question is whether all drivers are supported.  Red Hat 7.2 might not
have support for all the hardware that is in an AMD Opteron ystem.

SuSE Linux 8.2/x86 works on AMD Opteron systems and I guess current
Red Hat distributions do work also,
