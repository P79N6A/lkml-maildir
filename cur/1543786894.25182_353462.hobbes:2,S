For now: a constant in power.h depending on sizeof(long) and PAGE_SIZE,
the size of swsusp_info.pagedir[] depending on it and the overflow check
in write_pagedir()?
Unfortunately it's not enough for what I'm cooking (think of resuming in 35 sec.
to a fully responsive system - well, that's on my box).  A preliminary patch
is at

We write the pagedir after we have written the image, so the address
field of each entry is not needed at that time, except for freeing the
image memory in case of failure (with the "rework image freeing patch"
they are not needed at all).  Thus potentially we can use the address
fields of pagedir entries to link the pages on the swap.
