---S------ = setuid (normally shows up as "s" if "x" is also set)
------S--- = setgid (normally shows up as "s" if "x" is also set)
---------T = sticky bit (prevents non-owner from deleting a file in
                         world-writable directory like /tmp)
See chmod(1) for this info.
Cheers, Andreas
