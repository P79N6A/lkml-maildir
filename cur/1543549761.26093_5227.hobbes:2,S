And now that I done some benchmark it seems the major optimization consists in
the implementation of the new _ordering_ algorithm in test2, not really from
the removal of the more finegrined latency control (said that I'm not going to
reintroduce the previous latency control, the current one doesn't provide great
latency but it's ok).
As soon I patch my tree with Peter's perfect CSCAN ordering (that only changes
the ordering algorithm), tiotest performance drops significantly in the
2-thread-reading case. elvtune settings doesn't matter, that's only a matter of
the ordering.
