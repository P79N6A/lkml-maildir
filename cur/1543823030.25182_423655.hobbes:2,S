In short file: consist of several blocks and fragments.
sizeof(block)=8*sizeof(fragment),
fragments used to prevent unwanted waste of space.
When file is growing and we occupy 8 fragments in tail of it,
we should allocate whole block and move all 8 fragments to it.
In 2.2 I suppose such code works fine:
bh = sb_bread
bh->b_blocknr=newvalue
mark_buffer_dirty
I doubt that it is normal for 2.4,
and this was completely wrong for 2.6.
