which I think is wrong. THis naming sucks. Sure doing a full sed on the
tree is not pretty but it's also not THAT painful. And the pain of wrong
names is something the kernel needs to carry around for years.

while this is a smart trick, I rather prefer seperate functions, just so
that people are "aware" which they use. Since 99% of the users is a
mutex anyway, the new names are only used in a few special cases.
