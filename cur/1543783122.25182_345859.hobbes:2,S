Yes, that's also something I was thinking of, but I wasn't sure enough 
in this radical change :)
Anyway, I do agree that this way looks better than the current one.
So, if you don't object against other changes (say, the suggested 
approach to set uart->pm), I can proceed with the changes you suggest 
and work it out to the new patch. ;)
Best regards,
