We are taking a refcount when isolating the page from the LRU. The 
problem is that the migration code attempts to free the page. That code 
could be changed to do something else instead like putting the page on the 
bad list.

Migration code does the adding back to the LRU when migration is complete. 
So he hooked into that I guess.
