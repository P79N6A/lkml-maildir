Hi,
with the help of kerneloops.org I've spotted a nice little interaction
between the TTY layer and the bluetooth code, however the tty layer is
not something I'm all too familiar with so I rather ask than brute-force
fix the code incorrectly.
The raw details are at:
http://www.kerneloops.org/search.php?search=uart_flush_buffer
What happens is that, on closing the bluetooth tty,
the tty layer goes into the release_dev() function,
which first does a bunch of stuff, then sets the file->private_data to NULL,
does some more stuff  and then calls the ldisc close function. Which in this
case, is hci_uart_tty_close().
Now, hci_uart_tty_close() calls hci_uart_close() which clears some internal bit,
and then calls hci_uart_flush()... which calls back to the tty layers' uart_flush_buffer() function.
(in drivers/bluetooth/hci_tty.c around line 194)
Which then WARN_ON()'s because that's not allowed/supposed to be called
this late in the shutdown of the port....
should the bluetooth driver even call this flush function at all??
