normally or guaranteed? 
e.g. possible scenario: one of the EFI runtime services needs
access to some device to do something (e.g. for rebooting
or putting information into the battery backed RAM). Wouldn't they likely 
provide a UC mapping to that device's memory using this flag?

Ok but what prevents the firmware from passing such memory areas?
I assume it doesn't know that Linux doesn't need such mappings, does it?
Anyways if all the questions above get firmly answered with no then the code 
setting mappings UC should be definitely removed.  I would welcome such
a patch.
