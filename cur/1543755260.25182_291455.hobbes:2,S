Hmm, I see, my "fix" leaks one page of memory during each
suspend... I've fixed it properly now and will eventually propagete it
back.
This should be right..
        while (pblist) {
                pbe = (pblist + PB_PAGE_SKIP)->next;
                free_page((unsigned long)pblist);
                pblist = pbe;
        }
