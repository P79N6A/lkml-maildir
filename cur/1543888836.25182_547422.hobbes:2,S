Maybe sometimes it's useful, maybe not, but I suppose that usually only the
controlling process should care about the critical signals received by the
controlled process. I simply don't think it should be a system issue. For
example I wouldn't like to have a lot of messages in the kernel logs just
because I'm debugging some segfaulting programs with gdb.
