The problem is that the ethip0 device also uses ARPHDR_ETHER. The usage
of that device is also unsafe. As I see the situation there are 2
solutions for this problem. First use some other Type identifier for
ethip0. But this is only a quick hack. I think about a new device type
ARPHRD_ETHERIP. This makes the tunnel devices incompatible with the
bridging code. But I think it is possible to convince the bridge code to
accept the special tunnel devices too.
Unfortunately I didn't saw the problem when implementing the driver...
