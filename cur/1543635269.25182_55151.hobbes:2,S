In fact, it was originally set to slave during its years of windows use...
I've moved it over to master (and tried both) after I encountered this
problem.

The numbering starts at 0, so if

IDE numbers apparently work just like HD numbers... its not order, it "how
its connected."  In this case, that means the ISAPNP driver sees that the
card requests the IRQ/ports associated with ide3.
and this would be the second interface, not third... (nit-picking...) I'd
have to put together a special boot disk to get a full dmesg, however...
We'll see... (I think... Unless boot messages are in /proc someplace, which
I doubt)
