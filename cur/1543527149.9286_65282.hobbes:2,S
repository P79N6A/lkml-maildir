Yes they are legal.  And in every case where I've seen them, they're a
mistake.  The semicolon ones are good at being invisible too.  I've
done it and spent hours not seeing the semicolon in my code.  Of course
it's easy to see in someone else's code... :-)
And yes, I've seen kernel patches fixing these bugs from time to time.
That's why we have warnings.  If the compiler knew they were illegal
constructions, they'd be errors...
have a nice day,
