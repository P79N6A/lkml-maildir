Right. The correct way of sending such a notice is returning I/O error
on read. It's standard and applications support it for years (of course
we can - and currently do - log the error as well).

Storing a log entry in system log doesn't tell applications there is
a problem. It's simply unacceptable.
Relocating on write (at filesystem level) - sure, it would be helpful
(possibly as a compile-time option - most IDE drives and things like
RAM disks don't need it).
