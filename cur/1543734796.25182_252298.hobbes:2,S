Subject: [RESEND][PATCH 2.6.9-rc1-bk8] ppc32: Fix arch/ppc/boot/common/ns16550.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[ Originally sent Sat, Sept 11 2004 ]
Hello.  When <linux/timex.h> started including <asm/io.h> this exposed
one of the fragilities of the code in arch/ppc/boot/, namely that it is
tied to the kernel headers for some information, yet not really the
kernel.  The following starts us in the direction of being less tied to
the kernel by providing our own serial_state definition (all we care
about is the ability to grab information from SERIAL_PORT_DFNS).
