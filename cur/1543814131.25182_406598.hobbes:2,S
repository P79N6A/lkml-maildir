Sorry, I didn't mean to sound threatening...
My response was meant to address Christoph's implication that we
shouldn't be keeping SystemTap out of the kernel tree.  Due to the
nature of SystemTap, I don't see any way around this.
If it is decided that hrtimers are unacceptable for export, I'll respect
that decision.
