You practically cannot avoid having initrd because you are very likely
to need to do some wifi config (at least ESSID and mode).
Well, you can, but it gets more arcane with each turn
(essid=,mode= module parameters - in each and every wifi driver!
and what if you need to set basic rates? Yet another parameter?).
It's analogous to DHCP+NFS_root boot - we do have ugly hack
of kernelspace dhcp client, but IIRC it is agreed that the Right Thing
is to do such things in userspace (if needed, via initrd/initramfs).
It simply allows for way more options what you can do in early boot
if you have early userspace.
