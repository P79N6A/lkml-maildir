Heh, this is the first time anyone has ever reported those names to me.
Yes, the names aren't very useful yet, but give us time, patches gladly
accepted to fix this :)
The physical representation of the USB trees within the PCI tree is
(imho) a _vast_ improvement over anything we have had before, and that
is currently working quite well.
Now to hook up the USB bus code to the struct bus_type style code, like
PCI now is...
