In fact that's wrong.  Although permissions are enforced by the ssh
server, the server assumes that once a conncection is established, all
requests on it are from the same originating user.  The server is not
able to check which user is accessing the files on the client machine
- which is why Miklos wants/needs restrictive permissions on the
client machine too.
