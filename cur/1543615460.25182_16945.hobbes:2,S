Not really.  Think of code whose execution is guarded by a test that
guarantees it won't invoke undefined behavior, but whose test is in a
separate translation unit.  Or even of code that is never executed.
The compiler has no business telling whether the code may potentially
invoke undefined behavior, or whether it's going to be executed at
all, it has to compile it to something that does whatever it wishes
*if* it's executed.  So, it should indeed die at runtime, not at
compile time.
