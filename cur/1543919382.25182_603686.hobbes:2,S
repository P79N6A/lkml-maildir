I am now using kernel 2.6.22-r8 (Gentoo) and the following kernel options:
i8042.nomux=1 acpi=off
I have tried kernel 2.6.23-rc9 but the problem is still there.

With acpi=off the problem is totally worked around.

I am trying to find a path myself in this issue - which dates back to at
least 2005 and has never been resolved.
I would now try some other kernel parameter in order to preserve ACPI
functionality and possibly prevent ACPI from messing up the keyboard IRQs.
Can somebody please give me istructions regarding the correct tests
(regarding kernel parameters and/or anything else) to perform in order
to better isolate the issue?
