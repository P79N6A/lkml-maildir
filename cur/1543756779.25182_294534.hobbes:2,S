It's not necessarily that simple (ok, maybe the idle loop warning is).
But at least one of the warnings I listed appears to be caused by a
kernel thread that is normally bound to a particular cpu trying to do
normal processing on another cpu before it has stopped.  Injudicious
use of __smp_processor_id or get_cpu in this case would only obscure
the problem.
