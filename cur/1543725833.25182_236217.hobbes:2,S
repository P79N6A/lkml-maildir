My code is in followup to the LKML discussion here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108700802812286&w=2
The goal is simply to put encryption keys in the kernel so they can be
used by a variety of systems, AFS, NFSv4, dm-crypt, CryptoAPI, etc.
There was also a bit of a discussion on OpenAFS-devel about it too.
Cheers,
