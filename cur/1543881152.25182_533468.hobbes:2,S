Excellent thank you very much (again!)

Yeah that would be correct. It's clearly possible to keep the whole design 
philosophy and priority system intact with SD and do away with the arrays if 
it becomes a continuous stream instead of two arrays but that requires some 
architectural changes. I've been concentrating on nailing all the remaining 
issues (and they kept cropping up as you've seen *blush*). However... I 
haven't quite figured out how to do that architectural change just yet either 
so let's just iron out all the bugs out of this now.

I can say without a shadow of a doubt it has helped :) I'll respin the patch 
slightly differently and post it and release as v0.46.
