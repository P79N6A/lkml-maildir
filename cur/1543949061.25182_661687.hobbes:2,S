So the device driver on UP can only operate through interrupts? If you are 
hogging the only cpu then driver operations may not be possible.

I am mainly concerned with making the mmu notifier a generally useful 
feature for multiple users. Xpmem is one example of a different user. It 
should be considered as one example of a different type of callback user. 
It is not the gold standard that you make it to be. RDMA is another and 
there are likely scores of others (DMA engines etc) once it becomes clear 
that such a feature is available. In general the mmu notifier will allows 
us to fix the problems caused by memory pinning and mlock by various 
devices and other mechanisms that need to directly access memory. 
And yes I would like to get rid of the mmu_rmap_notifiers altogether. It 
would be much cleaner with just one mmu_notifier that can sleep in all 
functions.
