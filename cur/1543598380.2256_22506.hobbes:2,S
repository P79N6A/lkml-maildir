But this (signal_struct) does not share the signals, just the
infrastructure.  I believe the thread standard defines some signals that
are to be delivered to a "thread leader" regardless of what actually
caused the signal.  Thus for these signals a separate mask & signal
queue seems in order.  I suppose one could use the union of all the
thread masks or some such, but this seems like a lot of overhead.  Also
need to introduce the concept of a "thread leader" (the thread that this
group of signals is to be delivered to) and what happens when the
"thread leader" exits (how a new "thread leader" is chosen).  I suspect
that the standard addresses all this, but I don't yet have access to the
standard.
Then, again, I could be suffering from too much coffee :)
