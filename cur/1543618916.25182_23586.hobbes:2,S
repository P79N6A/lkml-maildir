Nope, I haven't got it yet.  But, a note on "single-word oxymorons", from 
http://www.wordways.com/oxymoron.htm
:
	Appropriately, the word oxymoron is itself oxymoronic because
	it is formed from two Greek roots of opposite meaning, oxys
	"sharp, keen," and moros "foolish," the same root that gives us
	the word moron . Noting that oxymoron is a single-word oxymoron
	consisting of two morphemes that are dependent in English, the
	intrepid linguist senses a rich opportunity to impose order on
	seeming chaos, to extract significance from the swirl of data
	that escape through the holes in people's faces, leak from their
	pens, and glow on their computer screens.
	With books such as Warren S. Blumenfeld's Jumbo Shrimp and Pretty
	Ugly (Perigee, 1986, 1989) selling so well, oxymora (my preferred
	plural form) were a hot language item in the 1980s. Now that we
	can recollect that decade with some tranquility, it is time to
	attempt a taxonomy of the collected oxymoronic specimens and to
	set the aborning discipline of oxymoronology in some order.
	Single-word oxymora composed of dependent morphemes The more in
	oxymoron also gives us the more in sophomore, a "wise fool"--and
	there are indeed many sophomoric sophomores. Other, examples:
	pianoforte ("soft-loud"), preposterous ("before-after"), and
	superette ("big-small").
