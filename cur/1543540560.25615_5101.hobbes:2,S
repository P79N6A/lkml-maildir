Linus,
Have you looked at user beancounter patch?
ftp://ftp.sw.com.sg/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/user_beancounter/UserBeancounter.html
ftp://ftp.sw.com.sg/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/user_beancounter/user_beancounter-IV-current
(against 2.4.0test1)
It is supposed to track per-user resources (or total resources of any subtree
of the process tree).  One of the goals of the patch is protection from
different kinds of denial-of-service attacks (most famous are exhaustion of
physical memory by page tables, socket buffers etc).
User beancounter has several parts which overlaps your "struct user_struct"
improvements, and even have similar design.
One of the core design differences is that "user beancounter" is sticky and
is not changed when process changes its uid.  It means that there are no
need to recharge non-trivial resources from old accounting entity to the new
one.
Best regards
		Andrey
