It's not just about saving memory, but also to make it more robust. But
that's another story.
Since both the offset array, and the variables are mainly read only (only
written on boot up), added the fact that the added variables are in their
own section.  Couldn't something be done to help pre load this in a local
cache, or something similar?
I understand SMP issues pretty well, but NUMA is still somewhat foreign to
me.
