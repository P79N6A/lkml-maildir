I don't see a fundamental reason why it would be invalid to call
task_new_fair() when this_cpu != task_cpu(p). Besides, calling 
activate_task->enqueue_task->enqueue_task_fair() on a new born task (as
is being done in the patch you have sent) is slightly buggy in the sense that 
its p->se.vruntime is not properly calculated (because we set wakeup argument 
as 0).
We (myself, Kamalesh and Dhaval) have tested the patch below, w/o being
able to recreate the problem. The patch allows for task_new_fair() to be
called even for the case when child is being added to another cpu's
runqueue.
--
Child task may be added on a different cpu that the one on which parent
is running. In which case, task_new_fair() should check whether the new
born task's parent entity should be added as well on the cfs_rq.
Patch below fixes the problem in task_new_fair.
