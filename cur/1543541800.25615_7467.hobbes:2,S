Well, what does it *usually* mean?
Just apply the usual damn access controls. You don't actually think NTFS  
doesn't do that, too, do you? (Or networking under MacOS.)
It's nothing particularly new. *This* part of multi-user those other  
systems have already covered.
Hell, think of what happens when you pit in a CD. How do you change  
attributes on a CD? Simple: you don't, and nobody is all that surprised  
about it.
Don't create problem out of thin air.

Which OS would that be? Not Linux, in any case. NT (or MacOS) copy *so*  
many of the basic Unix ideas (for example, the hierarchical filesystem, or  
the idea of file-is-a-stream) that this claim just won't wash.

Userland fs support for the kernel would be *very* useful for quite a  
number of different applications.

And I bet that was part of the motivation of having forks in the first  
place. "We need this additional stuff, we already understand files ..."
