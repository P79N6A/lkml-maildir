at the very least the 6 seconds difference on a ~6 minutes load between
anonvma and anonmm sounds smaller than the measurement error generated
by disk seeks for a swapping workload, so yes, I'd like to see all 5
runs (not just the average).
As for the difference between 2.6.5 and 2.6.5-anonvma, that might be the
memory saved by the removal of rmap that in turn reduces the swap-I/O
required to complete the load or something like that, so that one may
not be a measurement error but just the benefit of anon-vma or anonmm,
but for a 6 seconds difference during a swap load I'd definitely like to
see the 5 runs.
Thanks!
