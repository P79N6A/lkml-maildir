probably that Greg is currently very busy, as he has not posted for the
last 5 days. I can attest it's not always easy to find the time needed
to release on time. Give him a few more days. People have seen 2.4.35
drifting by nearly one month after I announced -rc1, so 5 days is really
not much here ;-)
