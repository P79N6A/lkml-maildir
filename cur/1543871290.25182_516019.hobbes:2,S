Works:
6857  open("/sys/class/net",
O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE|O_DIRECTORY) = 13
6857  fstat64(13, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
6857  fcntl64(13, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)  = 0
6857  getdents64(13, /* 5 entries */, 4096) = 120
6857  readlink("/sys/class/net/eth1", 0x80a2450, 256) = -1 EINVAL
(Invalid argument)
6857  readlink("/sys/class/net/eth1/device",
"../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:02.0", 256) = 53
6857  readlink("/sys/class/net/lo", 0x80a2450, 256) = -1 EINVAL
(Invalid argument)
6857  readlink("/sys/class/net/lo/device", 0x80a2450, 256) = -1 ENOENT
(No such
file or directory)
6857  readlink("/sys/class/net/eth0", 0x80a2450, 256) = -1 EINVAL
(Invalid argument)
6857  readlink("/sys/class/net/eth0/device",
"../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:01.0", 256) = 53
6857  getdents64(13, /* 0 entries */, 4096) = 0
6857  close(13)                         = 0
