I disagree, jitterbug is cool, but it doesn't handle all the points Rik have 
asked for. Especially point 3 : check that each patch apply and if not, send 
a mail to the maintainer. Or points 4,5, ...
It shouldn't be difficult to write such a system, though. The problem is : 
would that kind of system be used. I don't even ask about Linus : I know he 
won't.
	What about Marcelo, Alan and the main-kernel-part maintainers ?
Marcello, Alan, tell us you would use such a system, and I'm sure people 
would try to setup something.
Too much people have actually spent time on developping tools especially for 
the linux kernel. Tell us you'll use such a system, and we'll write/hack it.
You remember Linus saying he'll integrate kbuild and cml2 between 2.5.1 and 
2.5.2 ? Do you still believe this ? I don't.
And, btw, jitterbug is too big for Linus. He's afraid of too complex system. 
IMHO he could consider using a small&simple tool that fit exactly his view of 
what kernel development is.
That is : how it's done today, but automaticated.
"he could". But how to know ? no way, no way.
