Subject: [PATCH -mm] freezer: Document task_lock in thaw_process
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/20/364

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
The task_lock() in include/linux/freezer.h:thaw_process() looks as though it
were protecting p->flags, which is not the case.  Add a comment that explains
why it's there.
