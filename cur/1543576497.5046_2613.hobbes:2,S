While running X, Netscape and dbench (2 threads) on the 16mb machine the
number of successful write request merges increased by around 1000
(without the patch it was an average of 4000 write merges).
The dbench throughtput increased from 2.0Mb/s to 2.3Mb/s on average.
(Note: the swap partition was on the same disk as the rest of the system)
