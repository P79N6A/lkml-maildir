Hi,
   My computer has two 1394 port, one is in the front panel, and another
is in the back. I found with linux 1394 ethernet support, I only get one
ethernet device named eth1.
   After read code, I found author says "This is where we add all of
our ethernet * devices. One for each host."
   Then my question is:
   1. Is it possible to use every 1394 port as a ethernet device?
   2. If not, which port should I plug my firewire line into?
   3. If I must plug my firewire line in some port, can I change the
default port to use?
   Thanks.
