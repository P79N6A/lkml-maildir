By default, Squid blocks everything but 80, 21, 443, 563, 70, 210 and
1025-65535... but then again, by default squid blocks connections from all hosts
to force you to change the configuration defaults :)
Actually, Squid can be used to automatically rewrite URL's to forward to khttpd
for connections quite easily when using Squid as a web accelerator.
