Hello, I haven't had any trouble upgrading the kernel til now.
the problem is this. i can't load 80% of the modules i compiled.
I have tried alot of things. depmod -a depmod this, depmod that.
i did rm -rf /lib/modules/2.4.9 & /usr/src/linux , rextracted the kernel,
configured and compiled it. it boots fine, i just can't load anything.
im running mandrake 7.2.
i did make clean, make mrproper a few times that didnt help.
i download 2.4.9 again and started over with the same results.
I even downloaded 2.4.6 and tried it, but produced the same results.
Im currently running 2.4.6 that works fine, .
whats wrong and how do i fix it. thanks everyone
