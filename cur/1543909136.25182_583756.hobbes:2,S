KDB used to have a "last branch recording" (lbr) feature.  The page
fault handler was modified to disable lbr before entering
do_page_fault().  Nobody seemed to care about the slight slowdown but
also nobody seemed to be using that feature for debugging, we rarely
get wild branches into the middle of nowhere.  lbr was messy to
maintain for very little gain, so I removed it from KDB at
2.6.17-i386-2.
