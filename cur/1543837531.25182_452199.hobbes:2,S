Ones which tell me what the code is attempting to do.  Ones which tell me
the things which I need to know and which I cannot determine from the
implementation within a reasonable period of time.  Ones which tell me
about the hidden design decisions, the known shortcomings, the
things-still-to-do.
It's a bit of an artform, really.  I guess one needs to put oneself in the
position of the reader, then work out what the reader wants to know.
Good examples don't immediately leap to mind, I'm afraid.  Maybe some of
fs/buffer.c?  That's important and pretty tricky code in there, so it goes
to some lengths.
