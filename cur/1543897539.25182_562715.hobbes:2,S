I'd argue that security-module-insertion is actually MORE complicated  
than removal.  Here's one example:  TOMOYO cares about the process  
execution tree, but you can't penalize the no-LSM case by a percent  
or two to add that kind of data.  When TOMOYO is loaded, it wants to  
do access control based on process execution trees for which data  
DOES NOT EXIST!!!  Not only that, but the processes which originally  
ran the one you care about (and which you'd need to recreate that  
data) may have exited anywhere from seconds to years before.  It is  
fundamentally IMPOSSIBLE to recreate that data, even if you could  
solve the problems of how to do it while the system is running  
without racing with existing process operations.  Imagine a process  
which hasn't had security data tagged to it yet which opens thousands  
of FIFOs per second, waits for your tagging code to assign security  
data to them in the filesystem, and then removes them; if you did it  
right you could prevent the code from EVER completely tagging every  
object (even assuming you could recreate enough information).
Such a need to add extra security data to multiple classes of objects  
is *fundamental* to any security module (isn't that the whole  
point?)  As such, you can't just "modprobe" one and expect it to  
work.  That's like mounting an ext2 filesystem, and then later trying  
to "modprobe ext3" and dynamically switch to the ext3 code and enable  
journalling all at once ON THE MOUNTED FILESYSTEM!!!
Sure, theoretically it *could* be done, but the code complexity is  
hardly worth it (plus nobody has yet even tried posting patches to  
make it happen).

Flatly impossible.  You simply cannot "load" a security module and  
hope to provide any useful information about the system's present  
state.  If you want comprehensive security it has to be there before  
a single byte of userspace code is executed.  SELinux sort-of handles  
unlabelled objects by treating them with a small set of initial  
"types", but that's only enough to get the system up enough to  
actually relabel objects with type-transitions (after init loads the  
selinux policy it reexecs itself, before doing anything else).

An LSM simple enough to unload would be too simple for anybody to  
want to load in the first place (even capabilities can have this  
problem).  What kind of security module would you load that doesn't  
need to add security data to objects?
Then of course there's also the -ENOPATCH problem.
