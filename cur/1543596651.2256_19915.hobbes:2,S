OK, that looks good.

I wonder why it only affects you.  Is the drive which holds
your swap partition running in PIO mode?  `hdparm' will tell
you.  If it is, then that could easily cause the page to come
unlocked before brw_page() has finished touching the buffer
ring.  Then all it takes is a parallel try_to_free_buffers
on the other CPU.
There's a similar bug in __block_write_full_page().  I'll
send a patch...
