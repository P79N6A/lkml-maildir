Not knowing what tt1 is doing it's hard to say.  Ah, I missed the
priority you used, so 99 above shouldn't be needed.

Dynamic is adjusted by the behaviour (using up timeslice, blocking,
waiting to run) or by nice.  Static is the base value used when figuring
out what the dynamic should be (can be changed via nice or setpriority).
IIRC, realtime priorities effectively stay static (unless changed
via sched_setscheduler).  The dynamic priority is what's used in
scheduling decisions.  The userspace interfaces are a bit confusing.
The kernel keeps track of it a bit more simply.  Internally, the
priority ranges between 0 and 139 (0 is highest priority).  0-99 are for
realtime tasks, and 100-139 are for normal tasks (note how the top 40
priorties can map to nice values -- where -20 == 100, and 19 == 139).
The nice(2) (and setpriority(2)) interface lets you adjust the static
priority in that upper range (and the dynamic changes accordingly).
The sched_setscheduler(2) ranges for realtime [1, 99] map exactly inverted
to the kernels priority (so while the syscall has 99 as highest priority,
that becomes 0 internally).

High enough priority set via sched_setscheduler(2), not nice value.
nice [1, 19] actually lowers your priority, while [-20, -1] increases it.
