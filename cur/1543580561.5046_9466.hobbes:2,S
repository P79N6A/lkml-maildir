I used to have problems with my motherboard in nearly all operating
systems if I let the system overheat.  I don't know the exact temprature,
but some of the chips were hot enough to literally burn me when I touched
them.  I run with an open case in a 40 degree room now, with minor
circulation of air around the computer and I haven't had the problem ever
since.  I turn the PC off on days when the room temperature exceeds 80
degrees, becuase that's it's primary time to overheat.
