Is it always CPU 0, or does it move?  Are you running irqbalance?  If you're 
running irqbalance, you can run a script that alternates between 'cat 
/proc/interrupts' and 'mpstat -P ALL 5 10' and watch the offending interrupt 
jump around between processors.  It's not as informative as oprofile, as Andi 
suggested, but it's really easy to set up.
