The point being that they *do* that. Each has its own bloody format. Each
will *have* to carry that code around, unless you will manage to push
every blasted thing into the kernels. Yup, plural. Linux is not the only
UNIX. Good luck doing that. If you are going to invent a new uniform
scheme - fine, go ahead, implement it as filesystem and I will write a
loopback-mount-on-the-fly. Oh, and don't forget to make them switch to new
format. Deal?
