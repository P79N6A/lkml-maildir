Subject: x86-64: Why minimum 64MB aperture?

I get this when I boot:
Checking aperture...
CPU 0: aperture @ 23a8000000 size 32 MB
Aperture from northbridge cpu 0 too small (32 MB)
arch/x86_64/aperture.c says this when aperture is < 64MB.
I have no way of changing this in my BIOS.  The systems shares video memory
with RAM.  All I can change is the amount of RAM allocated for video (32, 64
or 128 MB, currently set to 64.)
