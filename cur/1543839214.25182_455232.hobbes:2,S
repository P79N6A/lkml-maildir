looks like a real deadlock:
SIOCSIFNAME ioctl takes  rtnl_lock() then calls dev_ifsioc which calls
dev_change_name which calls the netdev_chain notifier... which ends up
calling bond_event_changename() which does:
        down_write(&(bonding_rwsem));
on the other hand, bonding_store_bonds() does 
        down_write(&(bonding_rwsem));
then calls bond_create() which does:
int bond_create(char *name, struct bond_params *params, struct bonding
**newbond)
{
        struct net_device *bond_dev;
        int res;
        rtnl_lock();
since these both are global locks and not per device locks, this really
does look like an AB-BA deadlock to me....
