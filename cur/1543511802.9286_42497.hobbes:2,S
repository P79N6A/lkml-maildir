  It may be worth pointing out that Linux does not lack a central location;
rather, it does not force you to depend on a single source for security issues
to be reported and fixed.  If you choose Red Hat, for example, they can be
your single source.  You can also combine Red Hat with other sources for N+1
reliability.  If you go NT, you are forced to depend on Microsoft.  If you use
Linux, you have a choice of providers, and you can choose the best.  
Rather... innovative, don't you think?  ;-)

  NT 4.0 lacks PnP, power management, and USB support.  Exactly the things
they are claiming Linux lacks, but does not.
  Furthermore, industry insiders have claimed that Microsoft *has* USB support
for NT 4, but is sitting on it to force people to upgrade to NT 5/Win2K.

  The fact that SMP scalability improvements are going slowly still stands.
Microsoft may have scored a point here, albeit minor.  Perhaps it can be
countered by the fact that NT scalability is poor, and does not seem to be
improving?  Fight FUD with FUD?
  "Microsoft continues to promise major stability, scalability, and management
improvements.  They have been promising these since the development of MS-DOS
2.0 in 1982."
RE: Support for Linux is expensive
> They aren't much more expensive than commercial support for NT,
  If you have ever called MS's support line, paid $35, and found out that you
will not be supported because you have an OEM disc, you will doubt how much
less expensive MS's support is.
  My favorite part of that call was when the techie said that all Windows
discs are mastered on UNIX machines to prevent virus infection.  :)

  Be aware that the same applies to the Windows newsgroups as well.  The lack
of open source preventing those Windows newsgroups from performing optimally
should be stressed.

  The lack of *skill* in your average Windows user might be pointed out.

  Dell, IBM, H/P, Compaq...

  It should be pointed out that any system administrator who does not take the
time to understand the latest bugs should be fired.

  My favorite meaningless statistics: Linux has been experiencing roughly
two-hundred (200) percent annual growth.  Linux has claimed 17% of the server
OS market as of the end of 1998.  If this continues, Linux will own the
*entire* server OS market by mid-2001.
