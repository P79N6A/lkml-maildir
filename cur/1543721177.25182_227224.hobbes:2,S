Speaking of gcc asm, is there a reason why out_le64 (specifically the
constraints) isn't written in this (simpler) way?  It seems to me we
can just let val be an input, as long as the "&" constraint for tmp
makes sure it doesn't share the same register.  This seems to generate
the same code for me as the current kernel version, at least with gcc
3.4.0/binutils 2.15.
	static inline void out_le64(volatile unsigned long *addr, unsigned long val)
	{
		unsigned long tmp;
	
		__asm__ __volatile__(
				     "rldimi %0,%2,5*8,1*8\n"
				     "rldimi %0,%2,3*8,2*8\n"
				     "rldimi %0,%2,1*8,3*8\n"
				     "rldimi %0,%2,7*8,4*8\n"
				     "rldicl %2,%2,32,0\n"
				     "rlwimi %0,%2,8,8,31\n"
				     "rlwimi %0,%2,24,16,23\n"
				     "std %0,%1\n"
				     "sync"
				     : "=&r" (tmp), "=m" (*addr) : "r" (val));
