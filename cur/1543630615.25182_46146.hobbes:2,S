Hello,
  I have a Tyan Thunder K7 (S2462UNG) which does not like using the nmi
watchdog automatically.  If I boot up nmi_watchdog=1 then the machine show
no interrupt in the nmi columns of /proc/interrupts.  While checking the
boot log I see the message about CPU#0 being stuck.  This is made more
interesting by the fact that if I boot using nmi_watchdog=2 then everything
works fine.  Why will the automatic detection using nmi_watchdog=1 not work
(my current kernel is 2.5.15-dj1)?  Thanks.
