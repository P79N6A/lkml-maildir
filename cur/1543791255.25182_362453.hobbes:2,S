It even supports SATA-3, not much good that it does me.
I managed to format it reiserfs in the end. dbench (yes I know it isn't a
great benchmark) gives me a write speed of 7Mb/s compared to 700Mb/s if one
of the disks in the array is attached to the motherboard SATA controller.
7Mb/s is quite stunningly appalling. I realise the release notes warn of
slow writes, but that's just daft! I have a few bits in my setup to check
before I start pointing the finger comprehensively. It may (for instance)
be a large partition problem (suggested on the ext2 list).
I'm taking it that it works at least for some people (did you test write
speed Lawrence?).
