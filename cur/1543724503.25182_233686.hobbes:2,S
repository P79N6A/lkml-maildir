Hi, I recently bought SN85G4 shuttle which has small mobo with nforce3 
on it. Integrated audio and nic.
audio works fine and nic gots regonized but doesnt work very well, link 
falls every now and then and whines about irq being lost and its totally 
unusable. Linux kernel version iam using is 2.6.7
It would be very critical to get this driver working because shuttle 
mobo has just one pci slot :-p (=one extra nic).
Is this known issue or do you want some debug info?
