The question is, what is tag_mask in libraw1394's
    int raw1394_iso_recv_start(raw1394handle_t handle,
                               int start_on_cycle,
                               int tag_mask,
                               int sync);
supposed to mean in the first place?  It is not entirely documented, at
least not in the currently online documentation.
However, as it works now, tag_mask is obviously nothing else than the
highest 4 bits of the OHCI-1394 1.1 iso receive contextMatch register,
which is...

How can we tell?  The author of libraw1394's rawiso API should confirm
or deny that. :-)

We could do this, but this would have two disadvantages:
 - We change the kernel's userspace ABI.  This is only done if serious
   bugs of an ABI need to be fixed.
 - We loose the ability to match two or three tags out of four, FWIW.
   The proposed patch can match only one or all four tags.
How about leaving ohci1394 as it is but document tag_mask better in
libraw1394's inline doxygen(?) comments, and maybe add an enum or macros
to be used as values of raw1394_iso_recv_start's tag_mask argument?
/* can be ORed together */
#define RAW1394_IR_MATCH_TAG_0       1
#define RAW1394_IR_MATCH_TAG_1       2
#define RAW1394_IR_MATCH_TAG_2       4
#define RAW1394_IR_MATCH_TAG_3       8
#define RAW1394_IR_MATCH_ALL_TAGS   -1
or
/* can be used for tag = 0...3 and ORed together for multiple tags */
#define RAW1394_IR_MATCH_TAG(tag)   (1<<((tag)&3))
#define RAW1394_IR_MATCH_ALL_TAGS   -1
