SCSI already does these partial completions...

That's not a valid argument. Whatever you do, you have to add some lines
of code.

... so if you do partial completions in the normal paths (or rather
allow them), error handling will be simpler. And we all know where the
hard and stupid bugs are - the basically never tested error handling.

Since one path excludes the other, you must choose a path first. Tuning
is honing a path, not rewriting that code.
