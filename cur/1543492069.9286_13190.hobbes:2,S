No, this is normal behavior. Vesafb uses _none_ of the hardware
accelleration your video card may or may not support. Since your CPU has
to move a lot of data (for me, 1024x768x16bpp == ~1.6mb for one screen)
around in memory, other CPU-intenstive programs (read: mp3 players) will
suffer.
The only reason to use Vesafb is if your video card is not yet supported
by your X server. If you have a supported video card, I suggest that you
use a high-res textmode and XFree.
However.... If your system supports MTRRs, this can give you a huge
speed boost, as is the case with my PII-450 and a S3 Trio3D card.
