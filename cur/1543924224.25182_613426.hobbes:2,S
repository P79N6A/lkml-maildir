Hello Andrew,
Thanks for the detailed background.
By now I also submitted a patch with extra spaces. Which one would be a
better candidate for applying in a maintainer's tree (which tree?)?
Could you please pick up one of the versions? Should I resubmit the
first version without extra spaces?
Cheers,
Emil.
