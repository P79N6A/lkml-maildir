It is a sad truth. Instead of raising real issues that may remain in the driver, I was presented
with "non-proof" that bus-adapter-device architecture I'm using is somehow bad and the driver
should be turned into a monolithic blob, using config variables to disable unneeded functionality.
Considering, that udev handles automatic loading of the drivers just fine (so it's not an end user
issue at any rate), I don't see any justification for the change.
