Looks like this problem was introduced by the change from PSMOUSE_PS2 to
PSMOUSE_TRACKPOINT in the TrackPoint support patch.  The Synaptics
driver needs to know whether the device on the pass-thru port is using
3-byte or 4-byte packets; however, instead of checking child->pktsize,
it checks child->type >= PSMOUSE_GENPS - and this check is now giving a
wrong result.  Therefore the Synaptics driver configures the pass-thru
port for 4-byte packets, and all 3-byte packets from TrackPoint seem to
be thrown away.
The patch below is reported to fix the problem - now the 4-byte mode is
used only if child->pktsize == 4.  Another option is to change the
PSMOUSE_TRACKPOINT value so that it is less than PSMOUSE_GENPS, however,
I think that checking child->pktsize is more correct in this case.
In theory, someone could attach a device which uses 6-byte packets to
the Synaptics pass-thru port; I'm not sure what would happen in this
case, but with Synaptics confugured for 3-byte packets (as the patch
below will do) this configuration even has a chance of working.

Subject: [PATCH] Fix pass-thru port configuration in the Synaptics driver
The Synaptics driver uses child->type to select either 3-byte or 4-byte
packet size for the pass-thru port; this gives wrong results at least
for PSMOUSE_TRACKPOINT.  Change the check to use child->pktsize instead.
