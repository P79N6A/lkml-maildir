I agree that you have no more security that using symmetric
but we believe you have lower costs, simpler key management
(which is a big headache alone), tougher to break through
(not unbreakable) and more centralization
As for modprobe u are right but we also need to check (apart
from kernel modules) the executables and libraries in the
usage scenario.
About time:
In my pc system running 2.6.20.3 (2.66 GHz P4, 1G mem) the computation of
modular exponentiation of 1Kbit (with a 32bit exponent all bits set and 
a 1024 bit key)
took almost 3ms. That's the time needed to check the signature of any 
code loaded
in ram using this module, after having it hashed (sha1) and signature 
extracted from elf.
