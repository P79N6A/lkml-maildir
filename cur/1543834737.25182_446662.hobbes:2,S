See racer test at ftp.lustre.org/pub/benchmarks/racer-lustre.tar.gz
It does the above, but a bunch more things and is a truly pathalogical
test script that does lots of "stupid user tricks", unlike normal tests
which are only doing operations that expect to be successful.
PS - during the racer.sh test run "rm" is known to segfault after hitting
     an internal assertion, nobody is sure why.
PPS- I don't know who wrote this program, it was originally posted by
     someone not the author to linux-fsdevel or something.
Cheers, Andreas
