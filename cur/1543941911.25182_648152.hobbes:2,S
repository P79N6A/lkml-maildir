to any reason i had some strange problems applying your patch. But i finally made
it and rebased my patch on top of it.
So, in a few moments i'll sent it here as v2 and also a quilt refreshed version
of yours (just in case also somebody had problems.. ah and i fixed a typo
in your signed-off and added mine).
Thanks,
Frank
