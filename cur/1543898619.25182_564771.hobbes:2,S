Following up on this thread (and various OLS hall conversations).  I'm 
interested in linking to documentation translations from 
http://kernel.org/doc,
 and it seems to me that the best thing I can do for 
Japanese is just link to 
http://www.linux.or.jp/JF/index.html
 and let them 
handle the Japanese translations.
For one thing, the documents discussed in this thread are already up there, 
and unlike me they can _read_ them and see if they're out of date or not.
Just FYI.
Rob
