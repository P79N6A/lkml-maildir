    rename(): could you comment on Linux rename(2) manpage? Quote:
           EEXIST  The new pathname contained a path  prefix  of  the
                   old.
           EINVAL  An  attempt  was made to make a directory a subdi=AD
                   rectory of itself.
    How do those cases differ?
Now that you point me to this page, I changed the text into
       ENOTEMPTY or EEXIST
              newpath  is  a  non-empty directory, i.e., contains
              entries other than "." and "..".
       EINVAL The  new  pathname  contained  a path prefix of the
              old, or, more generally, an  attempt  was  made  to
              make a directory a subdirectory of itself.
(The second part of this description is required to cover
cases involving symbolic links.)
Thanks!
