I have Logitech 4000s, Philips 740s and Logitech Sphere cameras running 24/7.
I always run latest stock kernel.
If anyone takes over the driver - I volunteer as a tester.
I do not have enough skills in C to write a kernel module but I can patch a 
kernel and test the cameras under real conditions - night and day including 
rotating the Sphere.
That is what I can offer as being part of a solution. I can also maintain a 
Sourceforge site if needed. But my 1.5 years of C experience (I am a 
hardware electrical engineer by profession) is not enough to maintain the 
code for a kernel module.
