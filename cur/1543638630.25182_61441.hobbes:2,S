My impression is that nowadays it's extremely unlikely that someone tries
to run a current 2.4 kernel on an a.out system - and since there weren't
reports of people trying to build binfmt_elf as a module it seems noone
actually hits this problem. Instead of exporting one symbol that is only
needed in pathological setups I'd suggest the following patch to disallow
the modular bulding of binfmt_elf:
