I think this check is vaguely incorrect, because it sounds like you are 
in combined mode.  That would imply that ap->port_no is incorrect, for 
this one special case.  (details: in combined aka legacy mode, port 
number is always zero because it is initialized as two separate hosts, 
not one host with two ata_ports)
However, since this is SATA, and PIIX does at least give us a "no 
device" indication, we could probably just delete the 'if' and the code 
you are commenting out as well.
Ponder, ponder...
Another thing I am pondering is detecting combined mode in 
drivers/pci/quirks.c, and reconfiguring the motherboard such that is it 
no longer in combined mode.
