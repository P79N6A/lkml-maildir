Thanks Alan,
My case is in header file such as:
#define hpSwapBit16(toSwap)	\
	((((U16)toSwap) & 0x00FF) << 8) |	\
	((((U16)toSwap) & 0xFF00) >> 8) |	
The files are created under NT (dos format} and copied into Linux with "cp"
command from "mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt" mounted file system.  There is
no special character or anything after "\".
