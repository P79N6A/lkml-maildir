I would agree. However can't unregister_snap_client be used in other paths 
apart from module_unload? I wouldn't worry too much since if 
register_snap_client and unregister_snap_client for the same protocol 
races it's a bug in the caller's code. The safe RCU list removal and 
synchronize_kernel should protect us from sane usage.
