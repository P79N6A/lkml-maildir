In my particular epoll application, the producer is tcp stack, and I have one 
consumer. If an network event is lost in the EFAULT handling, its lost 
forever. In any case, my application do provide a correct user area, so this 
problem is only theorical.

Please dont slow the hot path for a basically "User Error". It's already 
tested in the transfert function, with two conditional branches for each 
transfered event.

Yes, but this particular patch was a followup on own kevent Andrew patch.
I have a bunch of patches for epoll I will send to you :)
