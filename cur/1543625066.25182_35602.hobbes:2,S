This weekend I ran into exactly the same problem with parity errors,
but after updating to 6.2.5 driver version, kernel completely stalls just
after the line
  SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
The system in problem is:
Dual PIII-1266,
SuperMicro P3TDER motherboard,
onboard aic7899 SCSI controller:
  Bus  0, device   5, function  1:
    SCSI storage controller: Adaptec 7899P (#2) (rev 1).
      IRQ 27.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=40.Max Lat=25.
      I/O at 0xd800 [0xd8ff].
      Non-prefetchable 64 bit memory at 0xfeaff000 [0xfeafffff].
  Bus  0, device   5, function  0:

      IRQ 26.

I tried both updating driver for kernel 2.4.18-ac3 and switching to
kernel 2.4.19-pre3-ac1 - the same effect. Though on another computer with
Asus P2B-DS motherboard (onboard aic7890) kernel 2.4.19-pre3-ac1 works fine.

Andrey.
