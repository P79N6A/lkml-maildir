Only thing? I don't think so. 
You also want to make sure that regular users cannot send "impossible" 
packets. Think about the old "ping of death" kind of thing, where a normal 
mis-behaving (and I'm not saying intentionally so: it might be a small bug 
that just overwrites some data) program should _not_ be able to cause 
problems on the network.
Admins absolutely _hate_ that. They will ban an OS if it sends out packets
that cause troublem. You should remember that - we used to do strange
things on the net (long long time ago), and we brought down servers by
mistake, and nobody ever considered it a server bug: it was a Linux bug
that it wouldn't do the right thing.
Things like not sending FIN-packets when a program suddenly goes away is 
NOT acceptable behaviour! Neither is it acceptable behaviour to allow user 
programs to make up their own packets.

..and I'm not disagreeing that it doesn't happen. I explicitly mentioned 
PalmOS, I bet it happens in other cases too. But I'd strongly argue that 
it's a bug, not a feature.
It's a bug that people tend to accept in a "single-client" environment. 
NOTE! This is totally ignoring the fact that you can't be called "UNIX" 
any more. You _need_ to have sequence numbers etc be shared between 
multiple programs that all write to the stream. Again, that _does_ mean 
that you have another protection domain (aka "kernel" or "TCP deamon") 
that keeps track of the sequence number.
