aeb: my current code for device numbers does
	dev_t is 32+32 bits for major,minor unless that would give
	zero major, in which case dev_t is 16+16 bits for major,minor
	unless that would give zero major, in which case dev_t is
	8+8 bits for major,minor.
hpa: And so how do you distinguish between (0,2000) and (7,208)?
aeb: The former does not exist.
alan: Conceptually 0:something is a multiplexor device for
      legacy device nodes.
hpa:  But 0 isn't that.  I suggested making 0xffff the legacy device.
      That was the point I was trying to make.
aeb:  There aren't yet any conventions for 32-bit device numbers
      so you cannot say "0 isn't that". It is up to us now to choose.
      The present code in fs/ext2/inode.c does
	if (S_ISCHR(inode->i_mode) || S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode))
		raw_inode->i_block[0] = cpu_to_le32(kdev_t_to_nr(inode->i_rdev));
      that is, stores a 32-bit dev_t already, precisely following
      my format. Thus, if one uses 0xffff then disk conversion
      would be required. With my format the same disk can work
      with old and new kernels and with old and new user space programs.
hpa:  I'd still like to suggest a 64-bit dev_t.
aeb:  I entirely agree. With 32 the partitioning may become significant
      and 16+16 is suboptimal. With 64 there is no reason to not just
      use 32+32. However, some things I haven't checked (or have forgotten
      again), like: is raw_inode->i_block[1] guaranteed to be zero today
      for a device node? At first sight this seems not to be the case,
      which means that for a 64-bit dev_t a "conversion" is required,
      namely finding all device nodes on the file system and writing
      a zero into the presently unused raw_inode->i_block[1].
