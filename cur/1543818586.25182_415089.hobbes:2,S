Subject: [PATCH] [1/7] x86-64/i386: Don't process APICs/IO-APICs in ACPI  when APIC is disabled.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/11/71

When nolapic was passed or the local APIC was disabled
for another reason ACPI would still parse the IO-APICs
until these were explicitely disabled with noapic.
Usually this resulted in a non booting configuration unless
"nolapic noapic" was used.
I also disabled the local APIC parsing in this case, although
that's only cosmetic (suppresses a few printks) 
This hopefully makes nolapic work in all cases.
