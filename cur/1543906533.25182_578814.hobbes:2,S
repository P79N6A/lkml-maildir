Well what's wrong with it? It seems to use memory policies for exactly
what they are intended (aside from it being kernel directed...).

That still doesn't completely help because again it would require modifying
call sites (at which point I could just do alloc_pages_node).

I guess you could, but that is going to add a context switch to fork
(although it usually already has one in single-CPU situation because we
run child first)... I bet it will slow something down, but it would be
interesting to see.
I don't know the fork path well enough off the top of my head to know if
it will be that simple (with error handling etc). But I think it could
be done.

Yeah, you might be right there. If the numbers say that approach is
better, then I'd not be against it. But we'd still need the simpler
mpol approach to compare it with.
