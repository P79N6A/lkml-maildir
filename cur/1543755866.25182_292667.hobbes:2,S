no overclock
hdparm is used but I cannot tell you exactly what the config is (now
machine has been running memtest for 1.5 hour). I don't think I use
special option: probably the defaults in my config file (mult_sect 16,
dma on, write_cache off).
overheating: perhaps. The machine is hot and running many hours per
day (usually 12-16). It s running the fans very often, but it's always
been like that. I've tried to control the fan, but then the
temperature goes high very quickly. So I let the fans run.
