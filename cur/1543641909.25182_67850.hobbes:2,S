This currently only effects the initial bus reset delay.  If the driver
holds off commands after subsequent bus resets, it can cause undeserved
timeouts on the commands it has intentionally deferred.  The mid-layer has
a 5 second delay after bus resets, but I haven't verified that this is
honored correctly during error recovery.
