hi,
i am newbie in kernel programming.i like to know about
initrd stuff by simple definition.
what is initrd.?
how it is used?
why root filesystem is mounted as readonly and later
read write?.
i hope MMU is responsible for converting virtual
address to physical address in hardware level.then why
we need it software level[ie kernel level .two level
page handling]
