That's right (though I count only 8192 required with 4K page size) -
close to impossible on 32-bit architectures, though not so the 64-bit
ones, which still use 32-bits for count and mapcount.
I was a bit worried about this too, but Hugh didn't think it was a
really big a deal - I guess because the real solution for the refcount
overflow on 64-bit is to expand the refcount type.
Note also that we can exclude ZERO_PAGE from being refcounted, which
may be desirable for a scalability perspective on big NUMA machines.
The aim with this patch is to provide a patch which is as simple as
possible in order to get the mechanism right. But you raise a valid
concern and we do need to discuss these peripheral issues and sort
them out before it gets merged upstream.
Thanks,
Nick
