When I did a bisect, kernel couldn't boot and my testing log showed
it's at b5869ce7f68b233ceb81465a7644be0d9a5f3dbb. So I did a manual
checkout.
#git clone ...
#git pull ...
#git checkout b5869ce7f68b233ceb81465a7644be0d9a5f3dbb
Then, compiled kernel and tested it. Then, reversed above patch and recompiled/retested it.
If I ran git log, I could see this tag in the list.
