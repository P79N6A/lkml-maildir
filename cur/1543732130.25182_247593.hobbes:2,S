Excuse me if I'm being ignorant, but I thought always_inline was
introduced because with some recent versions of gcc, inline wasn't doing
the job (suspend2, which requires a working inline, was broken by it for
example). That is to say, doesn't the definition of always_inline vary
with the compiler version?
