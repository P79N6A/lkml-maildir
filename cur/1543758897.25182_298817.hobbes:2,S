Subject: [PATCH][5/11] IB/mthca: fix reset value endianness
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

MTHCA_RESET_VALUE must always be swapped, since the HCA expects to see
it in big-endian order and we write it with writel.  This means on
little-endian systems we have to swap it to big-endian order before
writing, and on big-endian systems we need to swap it to make up for
the additional swap that writel will do.  This fixes resetting the HCA
on big-endian machines.
