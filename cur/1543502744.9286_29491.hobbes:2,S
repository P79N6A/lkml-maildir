It's what more-or-less done now. Just patchlevel is used for new features
without changes in existing API and minor is changed when more serious changes
occurs. What about major... Not know... So far only three (or more like two)
major numbers was used. Not enough statistics :-((

Oops. Looks like you missed something: drivers are NOT uses published and
mantained API ! Userspace programs uses published API. Drivers are tied to
particular version of kernel (more or less) and it's internals. You MUST NOT
expect usability of driver for 9.7.43 in 9.for.bar (let alone
10.wibble.fish :-)...
Source-level compatibility is maintained more-or-less but binary drivers
should not survive even minimal changes in version number. They can (it happens
sometimes and it's amazing :-) but it's just luck not planned feature. That's
why binary drivers are "second-class citiziens" BTW :-)

I'm not know when new major number is used, but all other parts are clear...
