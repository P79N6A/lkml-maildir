I'm not sure about this to be honest. I can see a case for perhaps
having a couple of standard suspend/resume functions for platform device
based LED drivers as those functions are often identical. I'm not sure
whether there is going to be much need for more than that.
Having looked through a few of the LED drivers, even the suspend/resume
functions are often different...

What are your thoughts on multiple LEDs on a single device?
Given the LED class is going to get a conversion to struct device soon,
I'd prefer to put this on hold until after I've made that conversion at
which point I'll reconsider this.
