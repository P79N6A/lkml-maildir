If APIC is compiled in the kernel (wich is the case with most 
distributions) when I start kernel with "noapic" option, APIC is getting 
enabled anyway and only later gets disabled. This causes problems on 
some VAIO notebooks - it seems like BIOS gets confused if APIC was 
turned on (particularly on my laptop when I try to reboot from Linux it 
hangs saying that thera problems with keyboard). That would be much 
better to have an option to turn it off in the boot options and not to 
recompile the kernel. Could somebody comment this please?
Please CC me on this email address.
TIA,
