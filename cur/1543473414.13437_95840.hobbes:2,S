This is also why the K6 got bit in the ass by a Windows 95 bug that didn't show
up under Pentium-2 boxes. M$ did a simple timing loop and would take the result
of that timing loop and divide a number by it. Well, the K6 (350 or above) ran
it so fast that the result ended up being 0..
Boom.. kernel crash.. unchecked divide by zero on boot-up. Sometimes it would
boot, sometimes it would not.
The really annoying thing about that whole situation is that M$ made people pay
money to get it fixed (~$50 depending on the type of license you had).. well,
of course that file got spread around everywhere on the net not soon after but
that still angers me.
