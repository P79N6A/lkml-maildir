==> Regarding [PATCH] autofs4 - bad lookup fix; raven@themaw.net adds:
raven> For browsable autofs maps, a mount request that arrives at the same
raven> time an expire is happening can fail to perform the needed mount.
raven> This happens becuase the directory exists and so the revalidate
raven> succeeds when we need it to fail so that lookup is called on the
raven> same dentry to do the mount. Instead lookup is called on the next
raven> path component which should be whithin the mount, but the parent
raven> isn't mounted.
raven> The solution is to allow the revalidate to continue and perform the
raven> mount as no directory creation (at mount time) is needed for
raven> browsable mount entries.
I have a reproducer case for this, and the patch provided fixes it in my
environment.
