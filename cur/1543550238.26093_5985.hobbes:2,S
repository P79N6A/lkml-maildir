According to Miquel van Smoorenburg:

Right, I've now booted a non-smp kernel - same problem still.
Magic sysrq tells me that the kernel is stuck at 0xc01ca3b9, which
in my kernel is megaIssueCmd()
Disassembling the kernel and comparing it with the source code,
it turns out that it's stuck in
	while (mbox->numstatus == 0xFF);
Now megaIssueCmd() was changed in the 2.2.18 patch, and this is
the part that seems to be responsible for it (see below).
Alan, can you forward this to the maintainer, or tell me from whom
you got the 2.2.18 patch so I can forward this to them ?
