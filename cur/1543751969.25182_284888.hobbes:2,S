It looks like in the 3ware driver the procfs entry "/proc/scsi/3w-xxxx"
has been removed (or actually moved to sysfs).
Unfortunately, this breaks all the (binary only )-: tools provided by
3ware, which are indispensable for system maintenance.
Wouldn't it be more appropriate to keep the /proc-entries at least for a
transition period until other tools have been adjusted?
