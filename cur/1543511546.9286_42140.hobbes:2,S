"interrupt-time" doesn't just mean ISR routine, it means anything which
happens outside of the context of a process.  In kernel code, this is
almost everything outside of a system call*.
To demonstrate, call in_interrupt() before you call down() and if the
return value is true, printk some message instead of downing the semaphore.
That's not normal practice, but it's a quick and dirty way to test whether
or not this is your problem.
*one exception is the tq_scheduler task queue.
BTW, showing what message is printed with the panic would be very helpful..

Use a spinlock for this one.
