That depends on how you implement the interface.  If you insist on using
ioctls then yes, it's ugly.  However, if it is a file in sysfs, for example,
then you have well-defined open(), close(), read() and write() operations
and it is assumed you will keep some context accross eg. write()s.

We loose the saved system state, but the kernel that has just booted is
supposed to continue, so we should make it possible.  Alternatively,
we can do something like a panic and force the user to reboot,
in which case we can forget about the error paths, freeing memory
etc. altogether.
