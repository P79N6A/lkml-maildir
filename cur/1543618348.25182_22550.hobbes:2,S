What's the official word on the resulting stress on the hardware from
disconnecting and connecting rapidly like that?   Has any test ever been
carried out to see if it causes damage after say, a couple months of
use?  ...in other operating systems that had this already of course.  
always something not so safe sounding about turning the cpu on and off
rapidly added to the greater temperature extremes.   Also, can you
relink your patch?
