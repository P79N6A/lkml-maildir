Possibly... would it be pratical to have part of the module kernel
resident, and the pull its memory location/size off the kernel command
line? Something like memdevice0_mem_start=0xdeadbeef
memdevice0_mem_size=0xf00f? This would avoid crazy filesystem kludges,
but may not be practical for usability reasons...
