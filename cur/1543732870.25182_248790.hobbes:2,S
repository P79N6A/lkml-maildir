Hm, the last one I tried worked fine, but this one makes my qla card stop 
working, but not right way.  The system gets to init and then falls over, 
maybe when it starts doing writes?  The last version I tried seems to work ok 
though.  Has something changed in the PCI layer that would affect this?
Thanks,
Jesse
