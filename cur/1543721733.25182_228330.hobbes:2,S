The current linux libc headers package is much more frequently updated 
and closely matches released kernels.  LLH is a sanitized linux headers 
package and is currently based on 2.6.6 headers.
Yes you can build iptables on 2.6.6 for a 2.6.7 kernel.  I have built 
iptables once or twice a year and built kernels once or twice a week.  
Iptables continues to work fine.
