It's been bubbling its way up my todo too, as agpgart is starting to
get bug reports due to conflicts when the EDAC drivers or watchdog
drivers 'claim' the south bridge ID before agp gets a chance to init.
Someone sent me some patches a few weeks back, but I seem to have mislaid
them. I'll turf them up and get the sender to send them to lkml.
They should at the least, make a starting point.
