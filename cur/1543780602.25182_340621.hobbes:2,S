That's not correct w.r.t. SUSv3.  sa_mask should be always used and
SA_NODEFER is just whether or not to add that signal in.
SA_NODEFER
    [XSI] If set and sig is caught, sig shall not be added to the thread's
    signal mask on entry to the signal handler unless it is included in
    sa_mask. Otherwise, sig shall always be added to the thread's signal
    mask on entry to the signal handler.
Brodo, is this what you mean?
thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] fix SA_NODEFER signals to honor sa_mask
When receiving SA_NODEFER signal, kernel was inapproriately not applying
the sa_mask.  As pointed out by Brodo Stroesser.
