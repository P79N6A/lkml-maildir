Agreed, I think this is sane.

Patch looks fine, but I'm saddened:

..because we actually *have* the old hardware irq enable/disable value in 
in that "flags" parameter we just restored, so it's more than a bit sad to 
then ask again whether they were disabled or not!
IOW, I think this should be
	if (raw_irqs_disabled_flags(flags) && wake_klogd)
		wake_up_klogd();
Of course, not all architectures seem to suport that thing (it's currently 
only used by the CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS config option).
Damn. So close, yet so far away.
