Yoshifuji-san, it is rt6i_dev changes.  The problem is that
ipv6_get_hoplimit() gets called with NULL dev.
I believe it is an error in the logic for RTCF_REJECT
processing.  If user does not specify a specific device
index, and this is RTCF_REJECT, then we will end up
with dev being NULL.
It is this piece of code in ip6_route_add():
		if (dev && dev != &loopback_dev) {
It does not handle the case where dev == NULL correctly.
Original code did do the right thing:
		if (dev)
			dev_put(dev);
		dev = &loopback_dev;
		dev_hold(dev);
Maybe new code should be something like:
		if (dev && dev != &loopback_dev) {
			dev_put(dev);
			in6_dev_put(idev);
		}
		dev = &loopback_dev;
		dev_hold(dev);
		idev = in6_dev_get(dev);
		if (!idev) {
			err = -ENODEV;
			goto out;
		}
What do you think?
