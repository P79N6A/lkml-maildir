flushing/invalidating on umount is always a good idea. I could use a SCSI
disk to exchange data between my Amiga and my PC:
A: cp anything /mnt
A: umount /mnt
P: mount /mnt
P: cp something /mnt
P: umount /mnt
A: mount /mnt
I believe this will not work with the current implementation, although it
should.
