Subject: Take 2: Generic x86 config option.

Since I haven't heard "this sucks, no" yet, I'll retry.  Here's my previous
message:
--- 8< ---
After the discussion on the P6 microcode and how it shouldn't be dependant
on CONFIG_M686 due to generic kernels using M386, I made these incremental
patches for a generic x86 build.  They are incremental in case there are
issues with parts.
Basically, CONFIG_M386 becomes truly a 386 and MCONFIG_MX86_GENERIC becomes
the generic option. It's long I know, but CONFIG_MX86 is too close to
CONFIG_X86.
With this, the kernel configuration options could be changed from 'this and
higher' to be 'only this' to exclude such things as the F00F bug from
386/486 builds.  I haven't done that in this patch though.
Some of the options I would prefer to negate their meaning to prevent
double negatives (e.g. CONFIG_X86_POPAD_OK and CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC) but I
have not done that here to reduce the impact.
I tested this by running through config, oldconfig, and menuconfig.  The
help options I tested in config.

And now the patch: (now no longer incremental)

+Require working memory write protect
+CONFIG_X86_WP_WORKS_OK
+  If you enable this option, the kernel assumes your processor handles
+  writing to pages while in supervisor mode properly.
+
+  If you enable this option and boot on a machine which does not do
+  the above, the kernel will panic before starting.
+
+  If you don't know what to do here, say N if you want to use a 386.
+  Otherwise it is safe to say Y.
+
+Require INVLPG instruction
+CONFIG_X86_INVLPG
+  This option enables the use of a CPU instruction introduced in later
+  x86 models.  While not required, it can increase the speed of the
+  kernel.
+
+  If you enable this option and boot on a machine which does not do
+  the above, the kernel will panic before starting.
+
+  If you don't know what to do here, say N if you want to use a 386.

+  If you don't know what to do here, say N if you want to use a 386.
+  Otherwise it is safe to say Y.
+
+Assume no POPAD bug
+CONFIG_X86_POPAD_OK
+  Intel 386 processors may be hung from userspace by executing certain
+  instructions.  If you're more familiar with Pentiums, think F00F bug.
+  Unlike the F00F bug, however, there is no workaround so this can
+  only print a warning message.
+
+  If you don't know what to do here, say N if you want to use a 386.
+  Otherwise it is safe to say Y.
+
+Require Time Stamp Counter (TSC)
+CONFIG_X86_TSC
+  This option enables the use of a CPU instruction introduced in later
+  x86 models.  While not required, it can increase the speed of the
+  kernel.
+
+  If you enable this option and boot on a machine which does not do
+  the above, the kernel will panic before starting.
+
+  If you don't know what to do here, say N if you want to use a 386,
+  486, or non-Intel 586 class machine. Otherwise it is safe to say Y.
+
+Require Pentium Pro or better APIC
+CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC
+  The multi-processor local interrupt controller on Pentium and
+  earlier motherboards contains a bug in its write handling.  Enable
+  this option to work around the problem.
+
+  If you enable this option and boot on a Pentium or earlier machine,
+  the kernel will panic before starting.
+
+  If you don't know what to do here, say Y if you have a Pentium Pro
+  or later machine.  Otherwise say N.
+
+Require Page Global Enable (PGE)
+CONFIG_X86_PGE
+  Page Global Enable allows the kernel to keep certain maps of
+  memory always available.  While not required, it can increase
+  the speed of the kernel.
+
+  If you enable this option and boot on a machine which does not do
+  the above, the kernel will panic before starting.
+
+  If you don't know what to do here, say Y if you have a Pentium Pro
+  or later machine.  Otherwise say N.
+
+Use AMD 3D Now! extensions
+CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW
+  This option enables the use of a CPU instruction introduced first
+  in late AMD K6 models.  While not required, it can increase the
+  speed of the kernel.
+
+  If you enable this option and boot on a machine which does not do
+  the above, the kernel will panic before starting.
+
+  If you don't know what to do here, say N. Say Y if you own an AMD
+  CPU such as the K6-III, Athlon, or later.
+
+Fast unlocking for spinlocks
+CONFIG_X86_MOVB_SPIN_UNLOCK
+  Due to the memory ordering in x86 processors, the CPU bus on a
+  multi-processor system need not be locked in order to release
+  the software lock called a "spinlock."  While not required, it
+  can increase the speed of the kernel.
+
+  This would be default, except that early Pentium Pro processors
+  contain a bug breaking that assumption.
+
+  If you don't know what to do here, say N if you want to run this
+  kernel on a Pentium Pro machine.  Otherwise, say Y.
