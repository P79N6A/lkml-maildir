is your application really disk I/O bound?
I would guess that
- most of that global swap-file is always swapped in.
- "real-time filtering" sounds like the application could be CPU bound?
My test app is disk-io bound, I defeat the cache with a completely
random IO pattern , and I use > 60 threads/processes.
With 16 threads/processes, the difference is only 15%.
