What happens then when the kernel that you are compiling is not
going to be run on the machine it is compiled on?  Then you end
up with a machine that just compiled a new kernel and won't work
right next time you reboot.

What is needed is better userland configuration tools, not a
modified kernel build system that mucks with userland config
files.  Try using linuxconf, etc...  If your module options are
set in conf.modules, and you recompile a kernel, even of a newer
version, rarely if ever do the module parameters change.

Don't hold your breath.  This is a userland configuration issue.
What is needed is a tool that autoconfigures your system config
files ala PnP, and other such automatic configuration systems.
That and/or an easy to use configuration program which lets you
manually specify things and/or autoconfigs some things for you.
You have to keep in mind all of the various ways that the kernel
source code is used, and not just the case for the end user.
I do all compilation of everything under the sun on my main Linux
machine.  I have 3 linux machines.  I compile the kernels for ALL
of them on this one machine.  Think about your system now, and
how it would destroy my K6-200's configuration when I compile a
kernel for my 486 which has entirely different hardware...
Just wait 6 months or so.  Every linux distribution major release
gets easier and easier to use/configure by far.  Within 6 months
or so, I believe most issues like you're having will be dealt
with by far and large at installation time, and via some
autoconfiguration utils, and advanced system admin tools.
