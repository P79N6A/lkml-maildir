That's bad :-(

Obviously, it the oops occurs after the IRQs are re-enabled in crash_nmi_callback().
It appears that desc->chip->mask (in mask_ack_irq(), kernel/irq/chip.c:462) was NULL.
I have no idea how my patch could cause that.
This proves that re-enabling IRQs in this situation is too dangerous :-(.
I really did hundreds of dumps in different ways (echo c>/proc/sysrq-trigger,
forcing Oops and panic(), actually hititng Alt-Sysrq) and this never happened to
me.
