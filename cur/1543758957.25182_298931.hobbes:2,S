Even-numbered kernels started becoming a product after the next 
odd-numbered kernel series started.
2.4 might have it's limitations, but today it's a pretty good product.

The point behind this is:
It's not the most important question for a user whether the total number 
of bugs has decreased or increased.
The most serious problems for users are regressions compared to the 
kernel before.
If a user who is happily using 2.6.8 learned that "stable" kernel 2.6.9 
broke driver A for him and "stable" kernel 2.6.10 broke driver B for 
him, he will not try any new "stable" kernel simply because it only 
causes trouble for him.
Bad luck, if he therefore misses some serious security fix.
And yes, there are many people out there who use for many different 
reasons self-compiled kernels.

The traditional solution was to have a development series for the 
developers who don't stop typing and a stable series with few 
regresssions.
Until now, it seems 2.6 has too many regressions in every new released 
kernel for being a really stable kernel.
And people aren't dumb - you can't fool them with any version number 
games. People have learned that a -rc by Linus is equivalent to a -pre 
release by Marcelo. And they will quickly learn that a 2.6.<even> 
kernel will be equivalent to a -pre releaese by Marcelo.
What about thinking instead how to get a 2.7 cycle that roughly fits 
everyones needs?
It took two years from 2.5.0 to 2.6.0 .
That was long. Let's try to shorten it.
Make the feature freeze half a year after the start of 2.5 instead of 
one year as was done in 2.5 . This cuts off half a year of the two 
years. Yes, it really cuts off half a year, because the first year of 
2.5 also included half a year of IDE changes where even the bravest 
kernel developer didn't dare to test the kernel.
Perhaps there are also ways how the more developers, better tools and 
processes can help in shortening the one year after halloween.
