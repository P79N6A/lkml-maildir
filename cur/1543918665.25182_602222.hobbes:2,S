here is an update wrt. the latest checkpatch.pl-next version 
(v11-to-be), about kernel/sched.c warnings:
>   size                          # warnings
>   ----------------------------------------
>   25383  checkpatch.pl.v6       5
>   26038  checkpatch.pl.v7       6
>   29603  checkpatch.pl.v8       65
>   31160  checkpatch.pl.v9       24
>   34950  checkpatch.pl.v10      28
    35948  checkpatch.pl.v11pre   11
so things are heading in the right direction :)
of those 11 warnings, 6 are correct warnings (4 will be solved via 
KERN_CONT, 1 will be solved via a proper include file, and 1 is an 
overlength line), 4 are borderline warnings (easily fixed) and only one 
is a false positive! So v11-to-be gets the "best checkpatch.pl ever" 
badge from me :)
The false positive is:
  ERROR: need consistent spacing around '*' (ctx:WxV)
  #5322: 
  +static ctl_table *sd_alloc_ctl_cpu_table(int cpu)
                    ^
i think checkpatch.pl mistook this function definition as an arithmetic 
expression?
But, there's a cleanliness bug underlying this false positive: 
'ctl_table' is a typedef, and it would be cleaner to use 'struct 
ctl_table' thoughout the kernel. When running checkpatch.pl over 
include/linux/sysctl.h, it warns about the typedef:
  WARNING: do not add new typedefs
  #944: 
  +typedef struct ctl_table ctl_table;
(but mistaking that function for an arithmetic expression is still a bug 
i think.)
nice work Andy!
