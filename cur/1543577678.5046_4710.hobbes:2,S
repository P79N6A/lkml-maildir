It's very dubious at least. AFAIK no RFC1122/RFC1812 evulation has been done recently
(since 2.0 or so). Also part of these RFCs have been superseeded by later RFCs
that have not reached Internet standard status yet, so it would not be very useful
anyways (today's internet looks very different from 1989's when 1122 was written) 
The mechanism the comment refers to (asynchronous error notification for UDP, which
is not in traditional BSD) is not used by 99.9% of all apps BTW ;)
