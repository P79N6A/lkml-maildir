The obsolete messages point to some gcc-3x. It is no good for kernel compiles because there are many complex tricks in the kernel.
You ought to use gcc2.95-3. You can look for gcc295 compat package and libs at suse site.

P.S. Official compiler _is_ gcc2.95-3 also for 2.5 series. This is _not_ "obsolete" documentation. 
Could someone authoritative from kernel list please confirm that above still applies
