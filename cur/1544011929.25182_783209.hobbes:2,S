When you force the clock reprogramming to tick_dev_program_event(),
clockevents_program_event()
will fail a first time (like before because of tracing or whatever)
and then it will rebuild the next event:
now = ktime_get();
expires = ktime_add_ns(now, dev->min_delta_ns);
This one never failed on my tests.
So the above tricks which increases the min delta:
dev->min_delta_ns += dev->min_delta_ns >> 1
...is never reached.
But this is not enough. If I leave the things as is, the system
will success to reprogram the clock but in a delay which can be really too low.
It's almost worst: the system will not lock up anymore but will run in
an infinite and huge starvation
The effect is the same: a hang-up but without a soft lock-up warning
this time (it's worst).
That's why I'm dynamically adapting the min_delta along the time spent
to process
the hrtimer interrupt to reserve 1/4 to the latter.
This way, it is able (in theory) to solve the problem whatever the
frequency or the amount of slowness.
Note that I could have changed the things directly inside
tick_dev_program_event(), but there are multiple call
sites to this function and I couldn't be sure I'm not breaking something else.

No, if you don't force the clock reprogramming, and the usual case
continue to build
a clock event before the current time, the min delta will not be used
and you will get
a -ETIME error.

That's what I explained above, the doubling of min delta in
tick_dev_program_event() is never reached in
my case. And moreover I'm not sure it is ever reached whatever the
call sites of tick_dev_program_event()
unless min delta has a very low value...
