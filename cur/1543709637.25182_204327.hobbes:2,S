It'll average out to 68 pages per cpu.  (4 in ZONE_DMA, 64 in ZONE_NORMAL).
That's eight megs on 32-way.  Maybe it can be trimmed back a bit, but on
32-way you probably want the locking amortisation more than the 8 megs.
The settings we have in there are still pretty much guesswork.  I don't
think anyone has done any serious tuning on them.  Any differences are
likely to be small.
