Hi Andrea, seems good to me.

As clean upstream solution, could we make truncatable (ie. regular
file backed) mappings set a vma flag which changes its nopage protocol
to return a locked page?
filemap_nopage itself, rather than do_no_page would then take care of
handling the truncate races. That seems to be a better layer to handle
it in.
Also, after this there should be no reason for truncate_count, right?
(At least in its truncate/nopage capacity.) If so, we should remove it
as part of the same patch / patchset.
