	After months of using 2.5.x with stability on my box, and using 
2.6.0-test1 since the day after its release (with the 20030714 ACPI 
patch), I had two seemingly random SCSI hangs today. One shortly after 
I booted the box in the afternoon, and one after about 15 hours of 
uptime. I was busy the first time around, but the second time I managed 
to scp out a copy of the current dmesg to another box before a hard 
power down.
	Can somebody translate the error in the dmesg into english and advise 
me on whether I want to change something in the software or the 
hardware?

	Thanks in advance,
