Subject: patch so cciss stats are collected in /proc/stat
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently cciss statistics are not collected in /proc/stat. This patch
bumps DK_MAX_MAJOR to 111 to fix that. This has been a common complaint
by customers wishing to gather info about cciss devices.
Please consider this for inclusion. Applies to 2.4.28-pre3.
Thanks,
mikem
