Subject: [ patch -mm1 00/02 ] scx200_gpio: use 1 cdev for N minors, not  N for N

this pair of patches switches the driver to share 1 cdev across N pins,
thus decreasing memory usage, and simplifying code ( no kzalloc, or its 
undo ).
Q:  For some reason I havent figured, the cdev_put below breaks:
static void __exit scx200_gpio_cleanup(void)
{
    cdev_del(&scx200_gpio_cdev);
    cdev_put(&scx200_gpio_cdev);    <<<<<<<<  HERE
   
    unregister_chrdev_region(MKDEV(major, 0), MAX_PINS);
    platform_device_unregister(pdev);
}
  CC [M]  drivers/char/scx200_gpio.o
Kernel: arch/i386/boot/bzImage is ready  (#6)
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST
WARNING: "cdev_put" [drivers/char/scx200_gpio.ko] undefined!
  LD [M]  drivers/char/scx200_gpio.ko
It seems odd that it isnt available, esp since cdev_init()
is also used wo errors ( in -mm1 currently ), and its defined in same
source-file: fs/char_dev.c
At any rate, I commented out the call in the 2nd patch and it works.
I left it to mark the question.
thanks
