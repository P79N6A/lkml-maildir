Yes, sure, if an application wants to access the USB keyboard directly,
it can use usbfs. But if it asks for rawmode on the console, it needs to
be given PS/2 rawmode. And that inevitably means emulation in this case.

Backward compatibility, namely with X. But even X doesn't have a good
reason using PS/2 protocol to talk to the kernel.

For this purpose is console rawmode (the thing this thread was about) is
completely useless, because you cannot feed the data to the console
again.
For that, you need the exported serio interface. [Which means it wasn't
possible on 2.4] I agree exporting serio's as char devices is useful.

The "medium raw" mode exists since ages, provides keycodes (as opposed
to scancodes), and is used even for X on many non-386 architectures.
This IMO was the right choice.

Indeed. That's why it's there.
