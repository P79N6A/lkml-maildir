With 2.3.41 I am now seeing this same problem all the time (the "hda
lost interrupt" message)
2.3.41-pre4 seems to work fine, and I know 2.3.41-pre2 worked well. My
drives are:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.30
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
hda: WDC AC26400R, ATA DISK drive
hdb: WDC WD136AA, ATA DISK drive
hdc: Memorex CDRW-2216, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: WDC AC26400R, 6149MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=784/255/63
hdb: WDC WD136AA, 12971MB w/2048kB Cache, CHS=1653/255/63
hdc: ATAPI 16X CD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 1024kB Cache
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.06
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3 < hda5 >
 hdb: hdb1 < hdb5 hdb6 hdb7 hdb8 hdb9 > hdb3
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
I am not splitting any WDC drives. Is there any more information that I
can provide to help, or any suggestions on what to do? Should I just
split the two drives, one to each ide bus?
Right now I am living with 2.3.40, but that's a pain for my USB work...
Thanks,
