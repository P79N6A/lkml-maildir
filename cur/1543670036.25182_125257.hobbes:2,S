It is happening on both machines I am using whose hardware configuration differs slightly, however both of them are equipped with ATI video cards (ATI Rage 128 and ATI Radeon 8500), and both of them run the same version of X-server. That's about all they have in common.

I got the same problem here:
   AMD Duron 1.2
   SIS 735 chipset
   ATI Radeon 8500
On 2.5.67 I get freezes with XFree86 4.3.0 . It works fine with 4.2.1 .
Exactly the same symptoms: the box is dead, no message on the serial
console.
