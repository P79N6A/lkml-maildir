I'm yet to be convinced it is a good idea to use extents for this. Been a
long time since we visited the issue, but when you converted ext2 to use
the extent mapping stuff, it actually went slower, and complexity went up
a lot (IIRC possibly required allocations in the writeback path).
So I think it is a fine idea to live in btrfs until it is more proven and
found useful elsewhere.
