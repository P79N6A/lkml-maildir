I've started a new thread here since the old one got somewhat hijacked.

Now, IIRC, some time ago you asked me to try some patches :)
So I applied them (and Tejun's fixes as per the old thread) to rc4 (which seems

Hibernate/resume works but although WOL works on an init 0, it doesn't work on a 
hibernated system :(
