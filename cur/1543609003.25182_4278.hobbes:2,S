There are anyway different ways to output the same data, and yes,
probably spaces/tabs/newlines are more human readable, but I think
the right solution isn't something that limits a-priori the
complexity of the output. This will make developers more prone
to invent their own formats for special stuff. the lisp-like way
allows you to automagically put a description of the format with
little efforts, simple parsing, unlimited complexity.
Maybe you want limited complexity, but the format isn't your limit
anyway.
About the two level of nesting, take a look at /proc/net/netstat.
it's not very clear, but in lisp-like it can be translated to:
((TcpExt)((SyncookiesSent)(0)))
and so on. For every kind of proc output you can find today, there
is a good way to convert it in that format, that is at the same
time used by all the entries. I think you will hardly get the same
with space/tabs/newlines without to indirectly use it like (), that
will probably result in something of more complex to generate/parse.
I can't see any strong reason to adopt a format that will for sure
fail at some time in the future.
BTW I see that the idea isn't well accepted, so I'll be quiet ;)
