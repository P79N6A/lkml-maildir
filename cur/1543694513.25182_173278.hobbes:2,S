Has anyone had any thoughts about this issue?
To recap, in drivers/md/dm.c:__bind(), there is a call to set_capacity(), 
which sets the device size in the gendisk entry. But if the device is already 
open (e.g., mounted, or in use by another device (loop, raid, other 
device-mapper)), then the bdev->bd_inode->i_size field for that gendisk entry 
also needs to be updated to reflect this new size to the VFS.
My initial thoughts were to add something like this to the __bind() function 
mentioned above:
bdev = bdget_disk(md->disk, 0);
if (bdev) {
	bd_set_size(bdev, size << 9);
	bdput(bdev);
}
Of course, bd_set_size() is static to fs/block_dev.c, but it does seem to do 
exactly what we need in this situation. The only user of bd_set_size() is 
do_open(), which does quite a bit of locking before making modifications to 
the block_device entry.
Does anyone have any advice as to whether this is the correct approach, or 
what additional locking is necessary? Or is there a different approach that 
I'm overlooking?
Thanks!
