It is not about what I dislike, but about what is broken or not.
Putting u64 instead of a long or some kind of that _is_ incompatible
already, so why should we even use it?
And, btw, what we are talking about? Is it about the whole kevent
compared to kqueue in kernelspace, or just about what structure is being
transferred between kernelspace and userspace?
I'm sure, it was some kind of a joke to 'not rewrite *bsd from scratch
and use kqueue in Linux kernel as is'.
