If your ISR manipulates any data, which is quite likely, then
your driver code, that is outside the ISR, must be written
with the knowledge that an interrupt can happen at any time.
There are probably certain critical regions of code that must
be protected against modification from the ISR code. You need
to protect those critical regions with spin-locks.
Spin-locks have very little code. If there is no contention,
they do not affect performance in any measurable way. If there
is contention, they simply delay execution of the ISR to a time
where code is executing in a non-critical section. This delay
is necessary so, even though it does affect performance, the
system would not work without it.
