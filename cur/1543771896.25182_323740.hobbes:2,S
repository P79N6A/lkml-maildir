vm.overcommit_memory=2 prevents the possibility of overcommitting - ie
of address space being allocated to someone which is not used. Your swap
allocation data is showing pages allocated not pages that could be
allocated due to page faults. You need to look as the AS figures in
/proc/meminfo to see the address space committed.
Basically it went back to "sane" because you said "ok I might get OOM
but take the gamble", and since many programs allocate lots of space
they never touch it worked.
