i've released the -S8 VP patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc3-mm1-S8
this iteration is mainly a merge to -rc3-mm1. The -rc3-mm1 tree now
includes the generic-irq-subsystem patch which is a prerequisite of the
threaded-irqs feature in the -VP patch. As a result of this the -VP
patch got significantly smaller, down from 224K to 89K.
also part of the patch are further refinements of the preempt-bkl
feature and a couple of bugfixes, reported for the -mm tree but not
included in -rc3-mm1 yet. (All of these were sent to Andrew too so they
should show up in -mm2.)
to build an -S8 tree from scratch the patching order is:
