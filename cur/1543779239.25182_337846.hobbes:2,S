If that is what you want, I'll be happy to do it.
If one believes that suspend/resume is working on a large number of
systems -- working to a level that a distro can acutally support it,
then restoring our temporary resume IRQ router hack to make many systems
work
is clearly the right thing to do.
But that believe would be total fantasy -- supsend/resume is not
working on a large number of machines, and no distro is currently
able to support it.  (I'm talking about S3 suspend to RAM primarily,
suspend to disk is less interesting -- though Red Hat doesn't
even support _that_)
We can got back to the old hack, but it will probably just delay
the day that suspend/resume is working broadly, and actually
can be deployed and supported by distros.
