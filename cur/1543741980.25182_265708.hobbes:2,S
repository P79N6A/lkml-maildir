I'm getting this with 2.4.27 (SMP):
PCI: Using IRQ router PIIX [8086/25a1] at 00:1f.0
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B0,I29,P0) -> 16
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B0,I29,P1) -> 19
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B0,I29,P3) -> 23
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B0,I31,P0) -> 18
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B0,I31,P0) -> 18
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B0,I31,P1) -> 17
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B2,I4,P0) -> 27
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B3,I4,P0) -> 267
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B3,I5,P0) -> 25
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B4,I4,P0) -> 267
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B4,I4,P1) -> 267
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B4,I6,P0) -> 26
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B4,I6,P1) -> 27
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B5,I9,P0) -> 17
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B5,I10,P0) -> 19
  The devices which are being assigned 267 are Ethernet ports and return
error SIOCSIFFLAGS when I try and configure them with ifconfig. Devices
(B4,I6,P0) & (B4,I6,P1) (also Ethernet ports) can be configured with
ifconfig but don't receive any interrupts (according to
/proc/interrupts) and don't work. Devices (B5,I10,P0) & (B3,I5,P0) (more
Ethernet ports) work fine.
  I've tried various combinations of ACPI, APIC & hyperthreading
disabled & enabled but without any luck and I've run out of ideas for
debugging this. Can anyone help?
  The board is a Supermicro P4SCT+II with a 3.2GHz P4 (with
hyperthreading). The devices which are being affected are both PCI-X
Ethernet cards:
Intel PRO/1000MT 4-port Ethernet card (PCI-ID 8086:101D Rev 1)
Intel PRO/100S   2-port Ethernet card (PCI-ID 8086:1229 Rev D)
  I've attached some dmesg info and an lspci -v.
