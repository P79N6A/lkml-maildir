Subject: tasklets (2.3.x) question

A simple question:  I haven't been studying 2.3.x sources until very
recently.
Are tasklets the preferred way of doing things over BHs now?  I saw
the documentation in include/linux/interrupt.h about how they differ
from bhs.
However, it seems many drivers seem to still use BHs (immediate, or their
own).  Is this because they just haven't moved to tasklets?  Or is it that
tasklets are reserved for special use?  Can an interrupt handler safely
call tasklet_schedule()?
If I missed something in the Documentation dir, I apologize in advance.
