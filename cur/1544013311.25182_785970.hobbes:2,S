FWIW, I'm using 4.3 on all targets at the moment.  See
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/toolchain.git/
for fedora-based variant of that sucker.  And yes, it does include
cross-to-sparc; all but sh/sh64, in fact (sh had serious compiler
breakage around 4.3.0 and backporting from -HEAD was far beyond
what I considered reasonable at that point).
