Ok, the last status update.
Tyan K8E arrived today, and after a short while (much longer while than 
on MSI motherboard thou) it started spitting out errors again (this is 
in SMP mode):
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 35447511
raid1: sda3: rescheduling sector 27623856
raid1: sda3: redirecting sector 27623856 to another mirror
ATA: abnormal status 0xD0 on port 0x9F7
ATA: abnormal status 0xD0 on port 0x9F7
ATA: abnormal status 0xD0 on port 0x9F7
ata1: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0xd0 host_stat 0x1
ata1: status=0xd0 { Busy }
SCSI error : <0 0 0 0> return code = 0x8000002
sda: Current: sense key: Aborted Command
      Additional sense: Scsi parity error
And so on, and so forth, with various blocks.
At this moment in time, the resync of 160G raid-1 was attempted in the 
background.
MSI mobo from the original mail had nForce4-SLi chipset, whereas this 
Tyan K8E has nForce4 Ultra.
Yet again, if i enable apic, the boot process hangs here:
sata_nv version 0.6
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:07.0 to 64
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x9F0 ctl 0xBF2 bmdma 0xDC00 irq 11
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x970 ctl 0xB72 bmdma 0xDC08 irq 11
These are the last messages that I get. The same behaviour on both 
motherboard. Shoudl I enable apic, it hangs on that.
When I disable apic, the boot sequence looks like:
sata_nv version 0.6
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:07.0 to 64
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x9F0 ctl 0xBF2 bmdma 0xDC00 irq 11
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x970 ctl 0xB72 bmdma 0xDC08 irq 11
ata1: dev 0 cfg 49:2f00 82:7c6b 83:7f09 84:4003 85:7c69 86:3e01 87:4003 
88:407f
ata1: dev 0 ATA, max UDMA/133, 320173056 sectors: lba48
nv_sata: Primary device added
nv_sata: Primary device removed
nv_sata: Secondary device added
nv_sata: Secondary device removed
ata1: dev 0 configured for UDMA/133
scsi0 : sata_nv
... Thus, perfectly normal. Further on it goes onto ata2, and so on.
Hereby, the lspci from the new motherboard:

I'd very much appreciate some feedback on this. The box crashes every 
40-50 minutes in SMP mode, and without second core it's overloaded, and 
running on the edge of crash as well.
Let me know if i need to test anything or you want more info.
Thanks!

Vladimir
