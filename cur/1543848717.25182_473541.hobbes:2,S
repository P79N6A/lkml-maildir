Hmmmmmm...
(I strongly believe I've seen this particular unlikely place trigger sometime
before already!)
Could this be because
+#define IS_ERR_VALUE(x) unlikely((x) >= (unsigned long)-MAX_ERRNO)
should be made to be
#define IS_ERR_VALUE(x) unlikely((unsigned long)(x) >= (unsigned long)-MAX_ERRNO)
similar to what some other code in this discussion thread does?
(don't ask me which code is actually invoking this macro; obviously this
might be a problem due to unexpected (non-)failure which seems to be happening
here)
And some other (un)likely results here seem fishy as well, no matter
what kind of load I throw at my box... (pondering sending some patches
for the worst excesses). Any comments about those results above?
My results seem to strongly indicate that nobody else is doing unlikely
profiling??
