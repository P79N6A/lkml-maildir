Just a "me too" post - I've been trying out 2.6.0 over the past couple
of days, and this is the only real issue I've encountered. Just like
you describe, the pace of the music playing speeds up slightly, and
there are some mis-sounds for a few seconds. Then it comes back to
normal.

Could be. I have the same chipset (KT400A, actually).
