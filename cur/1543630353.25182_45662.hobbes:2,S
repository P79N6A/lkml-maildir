Are you using dhcp on that interface? If so, what happens to the dhcp 
client daemon when the interface 'loses' the ip? Is it logging anything?
Is it dying?
If you're not using dhcp, I'm a little stumped..

You could try to use the xircom_tulip_cb module instead, and see if it
solves the problem. I don't think it will, but who knows.
Despite what Configure.help says, xircom_tulip_cb is actually better
than xircom_cb. The latter should only be used if xircom_tulip_cb
has problems -- I haven't heard of any recently, but I do want to hear
about them if they still exist.
