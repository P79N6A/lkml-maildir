My method is this:
- enable CONFIG_FUSE_FS
- compile fuse from CVS:
 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@fuse.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fuse co -P fuse
 cd fuse
 ./makeconf.sh
 ./configure
 make
 make -C test
- in one shell:
 mkdir /tmp/fuse
 example/fusexmp_fh -d /tmp/fuse
- in another shell:
 mkdir /tmp/test
 test/test /tmp/fuse/tmp/test
The result is normally a completed run with "1 tests failed".  On
2.6.23-mm1, it just hangs after the first test.
I've only tried under UML, but since Rick is seeing it on real HW, I
guess this method may work there as well.
