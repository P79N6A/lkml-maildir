Thanks a lot - this patch really seems to help. The server is now up for
1.5 hours with the kernel patch and the error did not occur anymore.
Furthermore, another issue I had on that computer, seems to be fixed by
this patch, too: gcc and ld sometimes failed to compile/link a file at
random, gcc exiting with error code 1 and no message and ld exiting with
the error message:
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: rtld.c: 1075: dl_main: Assertion
`_rtld_local._dl_rtld_map.l_libname' failed!
This error occured at random. It seems to be gone now. I didn't report
it here because I thought it was an issue with binutils, gcc or glibc
but it seems that this kernel patch fixes it, too.
Thanks!
Christian
