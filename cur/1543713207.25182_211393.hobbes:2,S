It is faster. OTOH nothing prevent you to use your current method. You 
have only to handle exceptional condition instead of ignoring them. 
Handling by, for example, removing the fd from the epoll set and 
unregistering/freeing the associated data structures. IMO we can leave the 
current behaviour, but if someone sees huge problems with this, the fix is 
a one-liner.
