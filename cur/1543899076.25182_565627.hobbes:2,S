Not that I know of.  I think all the pieces are in place now.  The 
original problem was that Valgrind didn't deal with clone and didn't 
have accurate signal support.  I fixed that.  Then the problem was 
dealing with the densely packed small kernel stacks.  Valgrind now has a 
way of registering stack regions, so that it can distinguish between a 
stack switch and a normal function call.
So, I think all it needs now is to scatter some valgrind client requests 
around the kernel and give it a spin.  See, simple ;)
