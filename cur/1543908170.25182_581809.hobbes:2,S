So, why not do the access explicitly via an inline asm?  It
generates the same code, it's obviously correct, and it's
even *actually* correct.  Plus, you get good compiler
support (and compiler people support).

If we cannot find the bug in finite time, we cannot observe
the bug in finite time either, so either way that's fine :-)

And I'm saying this is a step in the wrong direction for that.

Except that accesses via volatile pointer casts open up a whole
new can of worms.
