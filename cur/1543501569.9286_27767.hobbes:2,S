Better to send the lot.  We definitely need the call trace.  The code
is useful and, depending on what the code does, the registers are
useful as well.  In any case you must feed the lot through ksymoops
before mailing, latest version is in 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops,
the kernel version is obsolete.
