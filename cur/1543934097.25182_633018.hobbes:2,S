Subject: [Patch 0/8] Remove 'TOPDIR' from Makefiles
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

TOPDIR is obsolete, use srctree or objtree instead.
This patch set removes all the TOPDIR use in the whole
source tree and finally drops it in the top Makefile.
They're against the current linus-tree.
Note that Patch [8/8] should be applied _after_ all the
previous patches are applied.
Regards.
