Hi!
Just wanted to let you know that the warning introduced in
[PATCH] core remove PageReserved
triggers when using vbetool, which is needed on several systems for proper
suspend-to-mem support:
[4301282.746000] program vbetool is using MAP_PRIVATE, PROT_WRITE mmap of
		 VM_RESERVED memory, which is deprecated. Please report
		 this to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
Reports of this haven't generated many results yet, that's why I'm
addressing this with a subject line which startles more people ;)
