Guys,
Is there a problem to define big global arrays in module (except performance issues) - big like 780Kb? I am having some weird issue here with __kmem_cache_alloc() allocating memory right in my array. It's probably some sort of memory corruption, but I want to make sure it's not something I am missing.
Thanks.
Alexandr Sandler.
