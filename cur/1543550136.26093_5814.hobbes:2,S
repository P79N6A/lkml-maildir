Hi Ingo et al,
I've been giving the patch a try, however it hangs my machine during boot.
Here's the important bits from console:
Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling
found and enabled local APIC!
It then locks up in Calibrating delay loop... 
Machine is an uniprocessor AMD Thunderbird on an Asus A7V mobo.
If you need additional info let me know.
Cheers,
Udo.
