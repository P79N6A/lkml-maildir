BTW, there is another solution, which you may or may not consider to
be clean.
That is to load a separate copy of the subsystem (code and data) as a
module when you want a new instance of it.  The code doesn't change,
but you probably have to move it around some and provide some sort of
interface to it.
I did this to the scheduler last year - see
