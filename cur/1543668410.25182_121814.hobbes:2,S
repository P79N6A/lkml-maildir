I'll have to check for the polarity and trigger but I have essentially the
same problem.  I've just been running without acpi on my laptop for months
since it won't work with it.  In my case, though, I do have the sound card
on the same interrupt
{25}: cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       
  0:   11772951          XT-PIC  timer
  1:         28          XT-PIC  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          4          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:         51          XT-PIC  VIA8233
 10:        263          XT-PIC  uhci-hcd, uhci-hcd, eth0
 11:     506669          XT-PIC  ENE Technology Inc CB1410 Cardbus Contr, eth1
 12:         35          XT-PIC  i8042
 14:      89289          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:          1          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0 
LOC:          0 
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
And my laptop freezes solid when I try to even run with acpi on.  I think
I even fixed my acpi dsdt table but I haven't been able to check due to this
other problem
