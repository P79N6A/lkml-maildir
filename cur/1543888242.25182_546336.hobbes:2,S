I'll take a look at fbmon... I've seen the fb_ddc_read stuff but didn't 
see many drivers using it heavily.  I think it makes sense to reuse 
your code where possible (in fact some earlier versions of the code 
made more use of FB stuff but was removed or rewritten for various 
reasons).

I'm not sure how portable that will be.  But regardless, if Linux has 
some of this code already, I'd like to reuse it.  I'll go head and see 
what I can rip out.
In fact, I've received some comments pushing me towards moving the core 
code (crtc, mode management) to drivers/video instead of DRM.  That 
might make sense, especially if we can just use/extend the FB layer's 
mode tracking structures.
Thanks,
Jesse
