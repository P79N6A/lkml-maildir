For most people, read/write access to /dev is rarely needed -- how
often do you create new VGs or LVs?  How often do you run MAKEDEV or
vgscan?  Sometimes you need to change tty inodes but that's what
/dev/pts is for.
If you do need read-write access to /dev but not /, put it on a
separate filesystem.  Leave just a skeletal /dev in your root
filesystem, enough to bootstrap.
