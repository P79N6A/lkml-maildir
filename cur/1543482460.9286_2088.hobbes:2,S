    Ok. So let's use sector addressing by default and have a DOS-compatibility
    mode which should be run-time compatible.  If the kernel detects the presence
Oh, please - stop this.
The geometry problem is the problem: what values for C/H/S

It is completely unrelated to sector addressing.
But we need the values for C/H/S that BIOS or DOS will use on the disk.
