Just a sidenote to say I should be sending you an update to it
(the /proc/$pid/smaps code) in the next couple of days, but merely
cosmetic ("map" -> "vma", cond_resched_lock, p?d_addr_next ptwalking).
I'm still pretty sceptical about it, but it's probably a useful
framework for people to hack on, to report whatever kind of page
numbers they're interested in for this or that investigation.
