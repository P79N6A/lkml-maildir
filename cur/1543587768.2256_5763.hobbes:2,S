I think the point being made is that if InPackets are at 102345 at one read,
and 2345 the next, and you know it's a 32 bit counter, it's completely
unreliable to assume that you have in fact recieved 4294867295
packets, if the counter can be zeroed.
You can say nothing other than at least 2345 packets, at most 
2345+n*2^32 have been got since you last checked.
