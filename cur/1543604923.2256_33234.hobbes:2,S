This time Linus took the changes for dmi_scan.c/sonypi.c etc which
includes now asm-i386/system.h, but he didn't take the changes
for include/asm/system.h :(
Basically, include/asm-i386/system.h needs to contain:
	extern int is_sony_vaio_laptop;
Alan, could you please fed Linus the exact patch for the next
pre version ?
Stelian.
