x86.git won that race ;-)
i've had a good deal of build testing done with that patch and there's 
no [bzImage-level] build breakage that i can report. Which is not a 
surprise, the quality of arch/x86/kvm/ is outstandingly high:
  $ code-quality arch/x86/kvm/
                               errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
  arch/x86/kvm/                    29           14566           1.9
as a comparison:
                               errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
  kernel/                         729           92796           7.8
see: 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/x86.git/code-quality
 . It's as arbitrary 
of a metric as all static code metrics, but the numbers it emits are 
surprisingly close to my personal estimation of the cleanliness of some 
in-kernel codebases i ran it again.
[ hint, try "code-quality kernel/sched.c" too ;-) ]
