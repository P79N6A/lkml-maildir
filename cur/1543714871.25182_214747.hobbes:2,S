	The difference in speed between regular and FastCGI shouldnt be related to 
process creation time. The speed up you see from FastCGI is because it 
doesn't have to be read from disk each time. So, you're really looking for 
performace enhancements in the wrong place. Tweaking process creation can't 
make your platters spin faster.
