But how do you think Linux has penetrated the enterprise market ???
We all have put dual boots on every windows machine we had access to,
eventhough this was clearly forbidden. And after repeatedly showing
to the staff that you saved their day with your Linux, they finally
start to get interested to it. One of my best customers has finally
bought about one hundred RHEL3 licences to replace amateur installs
on production machines. They would never have looked at it without
us braving unauthorized dual boots.

I think we should not worry about it, but we should not deliberately break
it in a stable series when that does not bring anything. The fact that
Adrian proposed to completely remove the option is sad. It's in the windows
world that you can't choose. In Linux, you make menuconfig and choose what
suits your needs.
