Yes, that one was my same problem. It was diagnosed to the VT6212L doing 
decidedly weird things with toggling the Async bit and tying up the bus. 
People seemed reluctant to either confirm or deny my suspicion that this was 
VIA trying to shine on benchmarks while screwing you over so what exactly 
that amounts to I don't know. My own solution has consisted of replacing the 
controller with a somewhat slower but decent NEC controller and selling of 
the VIA crapware to some unsuspecting poor sod...

Sort of interesting. I doubt something can be done about the idle thing 
though but David is the person to talk to. Leaving in the rest:
