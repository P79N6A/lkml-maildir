The concern then was that we enabled multi-sector writes across the
board. Russell's concern was that some host controllers weren't properly
reporting back how far they had gotten when a failure occurred. We now
have two solutions to this:
 * Let the drivers set a flag, indicating that the controller properly
reports the number of sent blocks, even when a fault occurs. Russell put
together a patch for this and it is already in Linus' tree.
 * Ask the card, not the controller, how many blocks got there ok. This
is only supported by SD though, so MMC still use only one block per
write (except for the case above).
The only problem I see is if the card has decided to completely shut
down so it's impossible to query the number of blocks written. In this
case, reporting correctly to the upper layers might not be a big issue
(as they can't take any action on the card anyway), so I do not see it
as a problem in practice. I have yet to see any comments on the patch
though (other than end users that like the speed boost).
