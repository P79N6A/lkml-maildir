Subject: errors in 2.2.0-pre8-ac1 and pre9 (system locking up)

I noticed a very strange error while using 2.2.0-pre8-ac1. I've been
using X, netscape, xfmail etc., there was a download going on by wget,
fetchmail was working etc. -- everything of these worked ok before.
Suddenly the load began to grow rapidly (I saw it using wmmon) but
everything was working ok. 'top' didn't show anything suspicious. When
the load reached over 20, no new process could have been started. X se
rver exited after a moment. Soft watchdog didn't restart the system,
ctrl-alt-del didn't work, and only 'SUB' (alt-sysrq-s, alt-sysrq-u,
alt-sysrq-b) rebooted my machine. 
This error repeated twice. No kernel oops, nothing in the logs. Just
unusable machine...
Second thing is that pre8-ac1 didn't lock my cdrom while mounting it by
automounter and normally. I could still get it out. It's a normal ATAPI
cdrom (I noticed it also on other machine with different ATAPI cdrom).

Addendum: I just noticed the error with locking the machine up appears
also in 2.2.0-pre9!!! And, the system after locking is unreachable by net.
Back to 2.2.0-pre7-ac5 :((
