This is probably a naive question, but this thread has already proved
me wrong on one naive assumption.....
If the sequence is:
1. append some data to file A
2. fsync(A)
3. append some further data to A
4. some writes to other files
5. power loss
Is it guaranteed that all the data written in step 1 will still be
intact?
The potential problem I can see is that some data from step 1 may have
been written in a tail, the tail moves during step 3, and then the
original tail is overwritten before the new tail (including data from
before the fsync) is safely on disk.
Thanks for your help,
