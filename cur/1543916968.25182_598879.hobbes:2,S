These are pure cpu scheduling tests, not doing any I/O this time.
All these tests are still "pathological" in the sense that they are only
meant to show differences between schedulers rather than try to simulate
real usage scenarios.
all the graphs are here:
http://devloop.org.uk/lkml/
Legend:
* 2.6.23-rc6-yield2: "yield2" patch is this one:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/14/157
* 2.6.23-rc6-yield2-highlatency is the same patch, but the kernel is
built without preempt, with HZ100 and the scheduling granularity is
doubled using sysctl.
* 2.6.23-rc6-yield3 is CFS-v21 combo3 + the yield patch
* 2.6.23-rc6-yield4 is this patch (queued for mainline? and in mm?):
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/19/409
of interest I found:
* rc6-mm1 is not always fair (see "ManyThreadsYieldOften" tests) - the
only one to have almost half the threads already finished at the half
way point when yielding often. Also slower for the "RandomSleep".
* increasing latency makes a noticeable difference (see "ShortPause")
it can be more fair, but it also makes it a lot more erratic (see
"Yield" tests)
* most changes are only noticeable with a large number for threads (look
for 'ManyThreads' in the filename)
Summary of the code: each thread loops 25 times, incrementing a shared
counter each time and calling "iteration()" which does:
* "Long Pause" tests:
1000 times sqrt() followed by 25 milliseconds sleep.
* "Random Sleep" tests:
sleep(n) after 1000 sqrt calculations, where n is a random number
between 0 and 99 milliseconds.
* "Short Pause" Tests:
1 million sqrt() followed by 5ms sleep.
* "Yield Often" Tests:
sqrt() then yield(), both 250 times per iteration.
* "Yield" Tests:
1 million sqrt() followed by a single yield().
All the source code is here:

PS: now testing -rc8, also added a test that consumes memory in each
thread. also now recording context switches and idle time.
