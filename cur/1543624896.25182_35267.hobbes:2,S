But we might just be rebooting, not turning off power. And in that case we 
may want to ensure devices are returned to a sane state. Like ensuring that 
the CPU startup vector is pointing at a flash chip which is in _read_ mode, 
not returning status words.
Yes, it happens. I was pondering a reboot notifier but didn't like that much
so was ignoring the problem for now.
