a similar dillema was in the highmem bounce code in 2.4; what worked
really well back then was to do it both; eg use half the pool for
"immediate" use, then try a VM alloc, and use the second half of the
pool for the really emergency cases.
Technically a mempool is there ONLY for the fallback, but I can see some
value in making it also a fastpath by means of a small scratch pool
