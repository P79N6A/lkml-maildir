in kernel 2.4.3 2.4.4 2.4.5
In drivers/usb/net1080.c somewhere near line 61 i see the following
	{ USB_DEVICE(0x1080, 0x525), 
the vendor and device id are reversed.
I have changed this to
	{ USB_DEVICE(0x525, 0x1080), 
and it worked since then.
I have checked it against the id database on 
http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids
Dear usb maintainer's, please change it.
best regards
Gerold
