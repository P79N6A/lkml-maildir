hi,
I'm using a huawei E220 modem and occasionally it doesn't work and I
must unplug and plug it again, run the scripts connection to make it
works again.
how can I unplug an plug an USB modem via software?
The other problem is that this device is recognized like a cd rom
although I have patch my kernel 2.6.17. here is the var/messages:
