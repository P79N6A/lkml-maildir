Well you would say, saving the keys into a file is not a good security measure as it is accessible, the trick is that before saving the key into the file the kernel would encrypt the keys with another key ( KEK- Key Encryption Key ) and this KEK is stored into non volatile register inside the processor, so although the file is accessible it is encrypted.

> OK, some would say, the user application could read the key file and passed the encrypted key into the kernel function, the kernel would decrypt the encrypted key and do the operation, which is fine, but some of those keys change at every operation, so they have to be re-stored into the file at every operation, it would be nice to have it done by the kernel.
One big problem with file access in the kernel is that all the file 
operations require a process context - they need a process to stick the 
file descriptor into, to determine access permissions, etc. If you just 
start calling file operations from inside the kernel you're essentially 
stealing whatever process you're being called from's context for these 
operations, which is unlikely to be a good idea.
Not to mention, that accessing files from inside the kernel usually 
means the kernel enforces a policy on file naming/locations, and putting 
that sort of policy in the kernel is usually frowned upon.
In the case you're describing I'm not sure why you couldn't just store 
the keys in encrypted form inside the user app and have it write them 
back out when they change, instead of making the kernel do it..
