As I raised elsewhere in this thread, the distinction between physical and
logical is troubling. Consider iSCSI, (aka SCSI-over-IP). It's analogous
to SCSI-over-Fibre Channel, except that rather than using an embedded FC
stack, it's using the kernel's IP stack. But it's every bit as much a SCSI
disk/tape/whatever as a local device. Ergo, it ought to show up in the
device tree so that it can be discovered in the same way. But where?
This is only one step (the SCSI midlayer) removed from the logical devices
created by partitioning, LVM, NBD, MD, loopback, ramdisk and the like,
that again, ought to be discoverable in the same way as all other block
devices. Perhaps we need root/{virtual,logical}?
