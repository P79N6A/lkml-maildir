SUSPEND depends only on (!SMP || SUSPEND_SMP_POSSIBLE).
This means that while we limit the architectures it can build on
if they are SMP, it can build on any !SMP architecture --
which probably isn't what we want.
I think the right way to go is your SUSPEND_UP_POSSIBLE suggestion.
Honestly, I though it was overly verbose when I first read it,
but I like it better now, especially since it works;-)
I'll reply w/ an incremental patch.

As you know, I don't think that it is worth dedicated config options
to save 16KB on an SMP+ACPI kernel.  The prospect of adding code to
slice that 16KB into finer grain savings seems even less worthwhile.
