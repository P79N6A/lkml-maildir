I have not changed it yet.  The other functions in that area
(mark_buffer_clean and mark_buffer_dirty) are modified in the lowlatency
patch to be followed by a conditional_schedule.  Why would this function
not also need it?  I only ask because the latency has increased from
0.6ms to 1.4ms and I thought this might be the cause.
