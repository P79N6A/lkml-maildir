Yess!!!
That's what did it, removing the sg? and st? entries from /lib/dev-state
did the trick. There were some oldies ghosting there. Thanks a lot 
Richard, I didn't even know that there was a dev-state directory to

Is there any comprehensive documentation on devfsd and devfs anywhere
on the net? Could be good to read a bit more about this.
