Hi!
I have some more information
6.) Kernel 2.4.19-ac4 (ACPI compiled as modules)
    a) no special kernel commandline option
       -> System does boot, fusion MTP driver finds the controller
       -> time runs 2.5 times too fast
    b) boot with "acpi=off"
       -> Same as 6a)
    c) boot with "acpi=off notsc"
       -> Same as 6a)
I tried also the following BIOS settings, but without
improving the situation:
*) Hyperthreading "disabled"
*) MPS 1.4 Support "disabled"
*) BIOS Update "disabled"
*) Plug & Play "yes" (this makes it even worse: linux crashes
               eventually as it gets confused by IRQ setting)
