The concept isn't at all hard to understand. But no patch is 'obviously
correct' if you want to protect against the _slightest_ possibility that
people might be abusing something you're taking away. 
Some people might define __KERNEL__ on purpose when compiling something
in userspace, to get something that would otherwise be hidden from them.
Would you consider that sacrosanct too?
