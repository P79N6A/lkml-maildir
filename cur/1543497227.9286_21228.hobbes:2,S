Have already begun writing a driver
PLX9060SD is from the pdf from plxtech a generic PCI2Local chip.
Also on the card are (2x) CD1865 (Cirrus Logic 8 Port Serial Chips
already supported in specialix.c) 
This works already :
- Transmitting
- Hardware Handshake
- Interrupt Bottom Half
- tty_driver 
Now i am working on Receiving, Software Handshaking and
the complete termios, ioctl support, things i havnt understood a bit.
But i am optimistic that i have a full working driver within a week
or something - Ill send a version as soon as i am able to
start minicom, type bullshit without swallowed characters, Oppses
etc ...
I am currently a bit confused in Locking issues (SMP/Interrupt etc)
Because the CD1865 contains 8 Serial Ports and their registers are
multiplexed (read: you can only read one ports registers at a time)
so you have to lock the chip for concurrent access. Also
you need locking for transmit buffer changes (char count, head, tail etc)
and i am currently unaware how to do this 
spin_lock_irqsave() and friends ...
But from reading in the serial.c/specialix.c i cant see them
using those and so beeing not SMP safe (in my view) and
getting more confused ...
