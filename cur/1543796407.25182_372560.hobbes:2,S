Surely this one had loads of notice though? I was using iptables with
2.4 kernels.

Did this affect many 'real' users?

I don't use any of these. I guess pcmcia-cs may be disruptive for laptop

So far I don't see evidence to suggest huge repeated userspace breakages
between Kernel versions that were implied earlier in this thread.
Whatever, we aren't going to see any more stable branches without
volunteers to do the spadework. As has been pointed out, this won't
always be an easy task.
