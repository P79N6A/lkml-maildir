Dude, again. This has nothing to do with the CPU. The arch IA32 is simply
_not_ made for 4GB, so, some motherboards manufacturers make a workaround like
Dave said, to Map such RAM. After all, that 0.6GB RAM will be used and
allocated for other resources. This is just how the arch works and I doubt it
will change.
Only thing that you can do is buy a new Mobo which might support Mapping for
the extra RAM.
There isn't really much that you can do.
