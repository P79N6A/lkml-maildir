It is not essential, it is non-portable.
Code you described is based on non-portable "expectations" about thread
scheduling. Linux implementation of pthreads fails to satisfy
them. Perfectly reasonable. Code is then "fixed" by adding sched_yield()
calls and introducing more non-portable assumptions. Again, there is no
guarantee this would work on any compliant implementation.
While "intuitive" semantics of sched_yield() is to yield CPU and to give
other runnable threads their chance to run, this is _not_ what standard
prescribes (for non-RT threads).
