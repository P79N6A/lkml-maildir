	There is a strange routing problem in NORDUnet network,
	which prevents  nic.funet.fi  from reaching a part of
	the world -- I take that to mean that the same part
	of the world won't reach nic.funet.fi either ...
	The list delivery will resume once the routing bug is
	fixed, as a matter of hours, I hope.
	Mind you, I realized what was going on only a couple
	hours ago, and the situation has been on for 36 hours.
	(Email queue timeouts threaten at 72 hours, I hope it
	 won't get to that..)
