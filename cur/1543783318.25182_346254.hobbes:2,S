    Yes, that may be the problem, but I think that is not the only
problem, see below.

    The fact is that if I mount the device under 2.4.31 using the
'sync' option, the speed are the ones shown above, but if I mount
them with 'async', the speed is that of the light ;) I mean, the
'sync' option is doing something even in 2.4.31. The same applies to
2.6.11, but I have to test in 2.6.12 & 13.
    Thanks for your help. If the problem is just that, the sync
option, I'll drop a note to the mailing list. Merci mille fois ;)
