I would believe the IA class is a hack to maintain good interactive
performance for the X window apps if the scheduler does not maintain
this itself in the TS (time sharing class). The standard Solaris
scheduler is not favoring I/O bound programs properly, especially if
these are driven by network connections. I have several programs that
are of the type poll() - recv() - work a little - send() type loops and
these get slow to a crawl if run in the TS class if the foreground
process (also in TS) is compute bound.
