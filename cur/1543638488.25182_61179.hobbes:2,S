I think that question is _how often_ pdc20265 is used as primary
controller? Actually I know a lot of mobos with pdc20265 as additional
controller (and I don't see the one that uses it as primary). 
Don't forget about "ide=reverse" parameter that allows you to treat
pdc20265 as primary if by default kernel treat pdc20265 as secondary.
So I don't see _any_ reason to force pdc20265 to be primary (onboard)
unless CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE is set.
