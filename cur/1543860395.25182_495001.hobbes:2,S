The question is: why does the kernel contain iget5 function that looks up 
according to callback, if the filesystem cannot have more than 64-bit 
inode identifier?
This lookup callback just induces writing bad filesystems with coliding 
inode numbers. Either remove coda, smb (and possibly other) filesystems 
from the kernel or make a proper support for userspace for them.
The situation is that current coreutils 6.7 fail to recursively copy 
directories if some two directories in the tree have coliding inode 
number, so you get random data corruption with these filesystems.
