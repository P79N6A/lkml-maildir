Subject: how to detect a 32 bit process on 64 bit kernel

Hello!
Is there a reliable way e.g. on x86-64 (or ia64, or any other
64-bit system), from the char device driver,
to find out that I am running an operation in the context of a 32-bit
task?
If no - would not it make a sence to add e.g. a flag in the
task struct, to make it possible?
Thanks,
MST
