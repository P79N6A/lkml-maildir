That was it what i thought too...but if you get a copied sheet from your
vendor, and there a jumper is named "Termination on" and the sheet also
says you can use this, then you probably think the disk has a
LVD-Terminator build-in...although such a terminator is quite simple,
some resistors, perhaps a small chip, not more...it would be possible to
integrate it in the drive logic...
But as said, my DGHS-Disk has a build-in terminator for use with
UW-buses...the bad thing is, that if you "terminate" the LVD-bus with
this, it seems to work...for some time...i had "/" on it and a part of
my /home-RAID5, and it run 2 weeks....
Solong..
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
