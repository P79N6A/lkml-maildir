I've been using a Microsoft Sound System 80 for some long now and I've 
allways noticed a strange message in boot. The only thing I need to get 
this thing running is UHCI and USB sound support. Here's the message:
Jul 19 19:04:29 deadheart kernel: usbaudio: device 2 interface 1 
altsetting 0 does not have an endpoint
Jul 19 19:04:29 deadheart kernel: usbaudio: device 2 interface 1 
altsetting 5 unsupported channels 1 framesize 3
Jul 19 19:04:29 deadheart kernel: usbaudio: device 2 interface 1 
altsetting 6 unsupported channels 2 framesize 3
Jul 19 19:04:29 deadheart kernel: usbaudio: warning: found 2 of 1 
logical channels.
Jul 19 19:04:29 deadheart kernel: usbaudio: no idea what's going on..., 
contact linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
Jul 19 19:04:29 deadheart kernel: usbaudio: mixer request device 2 if 0 
unit 11 ch 1 selector 2 failed
I don't have any problem at all with it.. just checking.
