Ok guys, I noticed that I *did* have pci quirks installed (the machine that
was upgraded from had some interesting problems) and I also had one of the
via chipsets enabled.  This new machine is piix4 (or 3, not sure which) so I
disabled pci quirks and the via chipset, the box doesn't lockup anymore.
Out of curiosity, one of you said that you had the problem as well, what
chipset was in the machine?
