I took a bit of a look at this, and it looks like some things changed
with the introduction of the flexible mmap in 2.6.9-rc1-bk1.
If you run the program below it will work, doing as expected. Now
comment out the the line "memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(struct sigaction));"
and program won't run as expected.
Now do "echo -n 1 > /proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout" and run the same
program again (the one with memset commented out).
Turning on signal debugging tells us that with legacy_va_layout=0
"SIG deliver (a.out:415): sp=bffff6c0 pc=08048434 ra=00000000"
where ra is the 8-byte instruction that's supposed to get us back to
sys_sigreturn().
Me thinks someone somewhere is using some of the bits that we
"accidently" pass via sa.sa_flags by not setting it to 0, the regular
flags don't seem to show this behaviour, and I couldn't see any real
checking of the passed value of sa.sa_flags.

	memset(&timeval, 0, sizeof(struct timeval));
	memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(struct sigaction));
	
	sa.sa_handler = &sighandler;
	sigfillset(&sa.sa_mask);
	
	sigaction(SIGALRM, &sa, NULL);
	
	timeval.it_interval.tv_sec = 2;
	timeval.it_interval.tv_usec = 0;
	
	timeval.it_value.tv_sec = 2;
	timeval.it_value.tv_usec = 0;
	
	if (setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &timeval, NULL))
		printf("Nooo!\n");
