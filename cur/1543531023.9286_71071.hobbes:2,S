I'm having a few apparently kernel-related problems with cdrecord.
Current versions:
cdrecord: 1.8.1a01
kernel: 2.2.15pre3
drive: Sony CRX100E (IDE with ide-scsi)
These have persisted through many past versions of kernel and cdrecord.
Problem 1: During some operations (erasing a CD-RW, finalizing a
disc), a lot of other processes on the system hang in the D state,
with wchan __wait_on_page.  When the operation finishes, they resume.
This is rather irritating.
Problem 2: Very often, I will try to burn a CD and get output like the
following (voluminous, sorry):

-------------------------------------------------------------------
i.e. it fails partway through the burn with the "loss of streaming"
error and I have a frisbee.  Also note that the fifo does NOT become
empty, so this shouldn't be attributable to over load.
I've tried making the system quiet with no particular changes.  It
fails the same whether burning at 2x or 4x.  I HAVE noticed, however,
that I have a much better success rate if I reboot and then burn the
CD immediately after booting.  In fact, I don't think it's ever failed
under those circumstances.
I found an old message to linux-kernel from Joerg Schilling (author of
cdrecord) where he responds to a report very much like this (same
error).  He suggests that it could be a scheduling problem in the
kernel, which seems plausible to me (i.e. cdrecord doesn't get to run
in time to write to the drive).  Unfortunately, I can't find this
message now, but does this seem possible?  Can it be fixed?
I think the drive itself is okay.  As I say, it seems to work okay
right after booting, and it works without any trouble under MS Windows
:(
Does anyone have any ideas for what I could do about these two
problems?  Are they kernel bugs, known problems, ??
Thanks.
