  No problem with that, it obviously should be done for all chips which

  Having the machine lock suddenly when user mode code is executed fits MY
definition of sudden total failure! Malicious user meaning anyone who d/l
something and runs it. Doesn't take malicious, just dumb. Somone wanting

  As long as it's not something the user can easily set wrong. If they
build a kernel for K6 and they have a P-II "stupidity, like virtue, is its
