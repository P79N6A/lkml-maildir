I did some serious bench.
On all my codes, using eavilly floating point computation, binaries
built with gcc 3.0.2 are about 5% slower that the ones built with 2.95.3
on athlon processor with athlon optimizzations.
On the other side, on sparclinux, same codes compiled with gcc 3.0.2 are
really faster, about 20%, that with 2.95.3
