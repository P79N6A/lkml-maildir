In an attempt to trace NFS activity to build some performance models,
I tried to strace the nfsiod processes.  What I would like to do is to
see and time the reads and writes the nfsiod processes are doing.
Unfortunately, when I ran 'root# strace -p <nfsiod-pid> -p ...' they
all exited, which seems rather odd.
I'm running 
Linux alpha-01.sce.carleton.ca 2.0.34 #1 Fri May 8 16:05:57 EDT 1998 i686 unknown
(Redhat 5.1)
Thanks
