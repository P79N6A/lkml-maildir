Hi,
the ACPI4Linux project has moved to its final(hopefully) destination:
http://phobos.fachschaften.tu-muenchen.de/acpi/
The ACPI4Linux project is a kernel driver project aimed at implementing
full ACPI support for Linux, including fan control, dock/undock detection
and a WindowMaker dockable temperature meter :-).
If you are interested in helping to write the ACPI driver, or if you
have any questions regarding the project, please write a mail to
acpi-project@phobos.fachschaften.tu-muenchen.de.
