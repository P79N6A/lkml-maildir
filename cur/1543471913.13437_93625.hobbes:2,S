What's about me, I am absolutely agree. 8)
Only it is difficult and useless. These sizes are used
not for user's pleasure but for two really critical things:
- memory management (full memory needed)
- flow control (size, as seen by link is important)
All three goals are valid, we just choose a middle point
to handle all of them by one number and with minimal cost.
