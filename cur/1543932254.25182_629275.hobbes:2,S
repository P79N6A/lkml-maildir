It's not printk(), or the console, that's the issue...
Consider logging to a file, which is quite common.
Dumping formatting characters in there is a bit evil.
Instead of using \r and overwrite, something like
Testing foo... ok
printk(KERN_INFO "Testing foo... ");
foo();
printk("ok\n");
... really is a lot better.  We used to do that a lot more.
