Nate,
This is most excellent news!
I'd like you to look at 
http://linuxquality.sunsite.dk/
The objectives of the Linux Quality Database are:
- to get more people testing the new Linux kernels in a meaningful way
- to give them tips on how to do it effectively, such as a link to your site and
other test suites
- in the long run, to provide an easy-to-use web interface to make it easier for
people to log more meaningful bug reports, with a powerful search interface to
make it easy to find the bugs a developer wants to know about
- to improve the overall quality of free software in general through advocacy
and education
I'd be most interested in your comments about the site and what I'm trying to
achieve.
Also see "Why We Should All Test the New Linux Kernel" at:
http://advogato.org/article/224.html
Unfortunately, Advogato doesn't provide for editing an article once one presses
the final "submit" button.  So I'm going to post an edited and updated version
of that on the Linuxquality site.
Regards,
