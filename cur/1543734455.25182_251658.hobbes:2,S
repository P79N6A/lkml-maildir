Hi,
I have the following patch to add to arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cpufreq.c 
under kernel 2.6. it enables the PowerBook3,3 plateform to dynamically 
change the cpu speed. Without it, my Titanium 2 powerbook 550 MHz have 
always its fan at full speed and crashes in various ways. The 
PowerBook3,3 plateform are the titanium powerbooks at 550 and 667 MHz 
what were introducted at the end of 2001.
I hope this patch will be included in the standard kernel as it is the 
only blocking problem I was experiencing using a fedora-2/3 ppc 
distribution.
The patch is against the standard kernel 2.6.8.1 from kernel.org. I 
know the file has changed under the various bk kernels, but it must 
also apply (as this plateform PowerBook3,3 is not taken into account in 
them also).
Regards,
