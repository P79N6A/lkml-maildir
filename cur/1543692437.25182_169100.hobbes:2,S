           Summary: Reading ACPI info from /proc filesystem pauses system
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test6
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: len.brown@intel.com
         Submitter: david@2gen.com
Distribution: Debian Unstable (sid)
Hardware Environment: IBM Thinkpad G40
Problem Description:
Now that I've got ACPI working thanks to bug #1265 I've got another problem. If
battery and ac power status is read from the proc filesystem, the computer
"freezes" shortly, causing the mouse pointer to jerk etc.
For reproducing this, try something like this:
while [[ 1 ]]; do
    cat /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC/*;
    cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/*;
    sleep 1
done
Now you may wonder, why do such a thing? Battery status applet as shipped with
gnome (and probably many other similar apps) read these values once a second,
making the system annoying to use as mouse and applications are sluggish.
