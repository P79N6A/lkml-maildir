I'm not sure I'd agree that they overdetect failure, but it certainly
should be the application's responsibility.

OTOH it replaces a random failure mode (application dies if it is
unlucky enough to want to use a connection during transient network
outage) with a slightly less random failure mode (application dies
if it is unlucky enough to have it's keepalive timer expire and
have the transient network outage last for the next 11 odd minutes,
or whatever).
Not a convincing argument by any means I guess ;-)

No argument with that.

I think X probably needs a lot of work in this area. I remember
when we had some "transient network outages" here in the past, and
if you were unlucky enough to move your mouse past a copy of emacs
running remotely then that was the end of it. (Before our keepalive
days BTW ;-)
