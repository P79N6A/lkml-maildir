Could you clue me in as to how it can be done without problems in user space?

I don't think so.  I'm not trying to combine fork+exec.  I'm trying just to 
safely do fork.  In the user-mode kernel, everything runs in a single address 
space.  When a process forks, the call is modified to clone sharing a bunch of 
things.  The new child can't be allowed to run.  If it did, it would mess up 
the address space that really belongs to its parent.  This is why a 
CLONED_STOPPED flag would be very pleasant.
Instead of accusing me of starting a flame war, why don't you show me some 
code that's a nice a tacking a CLONED_STOPPED into clone_flags?
