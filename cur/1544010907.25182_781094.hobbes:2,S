Yep, but I'm trying to find a way to have it work without per-arch
wrappers ...

i.e. the ordering of the splitted argument depends on the os endianness?
What is the reason for this?
I'd prefer to have the ordering coded explicitly instead, like this:
asmlinkage int compat_sys_pwritev(unsigned long fd,
       const struct compat_iovec __user *vec, unsigned long vlen,
       unsigned pos_low, unsigned pos_high)
{
	loff_t pos = pos_low | (loff_t)pos_high << 32;
        [ ... ]
