But then you are replacing that with "vi junk" which, FOR ME, has this
only saving grace that is a tad better than a totally atrocious
"tkinfo junk" (but I am not Nathan Hand :-).
All of this is only stressing a point which I was trying repeatedly to
make.  People are bitching about a format when they really mean that
they do not like that or another particular info browser.  There is
**nothing** in the info format itself which would require you to use
THAT browser.  Personally I am happy with emacs info-mode but if
somebody else has different habits and taste than this is nothing new,
or particularly surprising, and they can pick (or write) something else
for the purpose.  I am fine as long as they do not try to hoist that
forcibly on me.
BTW, (this in a response to remark by Alan Curry) I am using 'less' in
front of man reader quite a bit longer than I am using Linux, which
will be from late 0.9x times, and I still think that its search
capabilities in that role are inadequate.

p.s.  What kind of a mystical force makes us see all the time
"heirarchy", "viola" (in place of "voila") and "kernal"?  The last
one got nearly extinct on this list - lucky us. :-)
