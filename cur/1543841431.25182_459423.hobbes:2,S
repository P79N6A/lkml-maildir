Yeah - you're right - it's garbled.  Looks like its dropping chars.
I don't know why, but I'm not surprised.  It's a lab system with a
new (for us) way of rigging the console output.  I just got this
particular x86_64's console connection to work at all yesterday.
I've been working indirectly through my good lab tech.  I should
drive in to the lab that has this rig (an hour away) and check it
out in person, and see what can be done to get clean console output.
This may take a day or three to yield results, unless I get lucky.
