Yes. But that doesn't help the people who actually use the native BK trees 
themselves, or the people who use the CVS exports. That was what Ben was 
complaining about. 
We already have the concept of "localversion*" files that get appended to 
the build. So the only thing that would be needed is some Makefile magic 
to create a "localversion-bk-version" file if the top-of-tree isn't 
tagged, and we'd get some unique ID for native BK users too.
