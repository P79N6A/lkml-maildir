Already knew that :)  There isn't much traffic on the VAX related
development lists (neither for *BSD not for Linux), but things are
slowly progressing.  These days, we try to work together (eg. we wrote
a graphics driver or two together, after we disassembled the machine's
ROMs.)  So unfortunately the userbase is small, but we perfectly work
together.
