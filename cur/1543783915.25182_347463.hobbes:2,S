Well, independent as in not the same, I meant. Let me think about it and
look at the code a bit, before making myself or anyone else more
confused. John, do you have any input on what I'm getting at? I know we
have discussed this before...

Yes, true. I didn't mean for the h/w interrupt source selection to be
part of the arch-independent code, but that we might need to include a
priority field in the interrupt_source structure to allow the
arch-dependent code to do so.

Well, it would be interesting to see if there's any difference without
that function, or if it's even getting called.

Yes, but it also might add a function which doesn't need to be. I'll
take a closer look at this too.
Thanks,
