Hi
I'm trying to write a block device driver which does some network stuff to satisfy the requests. The problem is, that the network stuff wants to grab the io_request_lock which does not work because this lock is already locked when I come into the request_fn of my device.
I looked at the implementation of the nbd which just calls 
	spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
	... do network io ...
	spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
This seems to work but it looks very dangerous to me (and ugly, too). Isn't there a better way to do this?
Thanks very much
