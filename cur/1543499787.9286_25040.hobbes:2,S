Wrong. You can use Java applets to report status - that's what 3Com's
devices do.

Oh, you can. If you're talking about configuration of the WWW interface -
cookies are there for you, if you're talking about the configuration of the
device itself, internal variables etc. are modified and stored on the flash
media. Where's the need for dynamic pages?

I think it would get used - memory savings would be quite significant, as
well as the time saved on context switches and the like.

You are talking about an environment where there are a lots of user-space
processes, many people connect to the server, many other servers talk to it
etc. - none of this is true with an embedded system. And if you have a
kernel with most of the services the given embedded system needs, asssuming
they are well written, you won't have the problems you just envisioned. And
try to stuff a full-blown httpd with CGI, FastCGI and whatsnot into a gas
distributor with an embedded OS (and don't laugh, such things with Linux
inside work in the Netherlands :)).
