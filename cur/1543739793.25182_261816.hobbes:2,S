I have verified the problem as described above.
PPP line disciplines rely on the previous behavior
of calling ldisc->close on hangup as a method for
indicating hangup to the line discipline.
This is explicitly called out in the PPP ldisc comments.
Other line disciplines may also rely on this behavior.
Alan's changes also added the ldisc->hangup() method
to indicate hangup, but all the line disciplines
must be modified to implement this method.
