I personally buy the argument that 80 cols helps remind people that they've 
used too many indentation depths and should redesign their code. I think it's 
a good thing to stick to where possible, even if just from a design 
perspective.
There are some cases such as the one Alan has pointed out here where being 
strictly 80 cols seems more destructive than useful, but those are the 
exception, not the rule (IMO).
