I write it for study and fun. And the main reason I chose parallel port is that I think it is simpler than any other device.

Yes, It is a userspace program to see what I can write parallel port device controller or not.
And, I'm sorry , I should not have explained my device driver in text, but should have written source code.
So that, the following is source code of the device driver. It works only to obtain I/O resource (I/O address and IRQ).

The CPU of hardware requirement is Athlon XP that shipped with SIS 964L, I think that has i386 compatibility but I'll manage with a execution environment having Intel and try it with the other machine.
In current machine, whatever I write date to parallel port controller which is in booked I/O address 0x378, I get only 0xff from inb(0x378).
I found that the check program that I worte in previous mail shows true with loaded parport_pc.
So that I read source code of parport_pc which is driver/parport/parport_pc.c to seek how it enable to write data to I/O line. And I located function to do I/O, that is parport_SPP_supported().
I thought that It was supposed to do enable to do I/O before calling this function, But I couldn't find especially processing.
After that, I didn't find processing that I seeked.
The mainly difference between my device driver and parport_pc , except for beauty and support of several device , is support of DMA.
But I believe this difference is not related.
