   My gut feeling is if linux aligns or pads things nicely for any reason,
   then the bye enables don't get used or clobber padding.
If the packet data length is an odd number of bytes, there is nothing
we can do about this, and the newer tigon3 chips are going to use a
cacheline burst for the end of the packet with the trailing byte
enables turned off.  I've seen this myself and sparc64 PCI controllers
generate a streaming byte hole error interrupt when it occurs and I
get messages logged in dmesg :)
   Maybe keep a shorter note about the bit changed meaning in later models
   just to document the issues.
We can "document it" by having the setting of this bit be protected by
chip version numbers.  I'd happily accept such a patch.
