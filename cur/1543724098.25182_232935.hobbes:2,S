It's the netfilter patches added to the gentoo WOLK kernel running
on packages.gentoo.org
Specifically, it's the tcp-window-tracking patch from netfilter's
patch-o-matic.  There's some bug in there wrt. it's window scaling
support.
I bet if the tcp-window-scaling diff is removed from the kernel running
there, the problem will totally go away.
I note that it is using a very old version of the tcp-window-tracking
patch, the current version is 2.2 and probably fixes this bug.  The
gentoo linux-2.4.20-wolk-4.14 kernel is using version 1.7
