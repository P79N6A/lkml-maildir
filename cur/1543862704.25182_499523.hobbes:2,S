It may help to note that the issue with __kprobes attributes is
separate from putting probes in the prologue vs. elsewhere.  The
__kprobes functions are so marked because they can cause infinite
regress if probed.  Examples are fault handlers that would service
vmalloc-related faults, and some other functions unavoidably callable
from early probe handling context.  Over time, the list has shrunk.
Indeed, __kprobes marking is a conservative measure, in that there may
be spots in such functions that are immune from recursion hazards.
But so far, we haven't encountered enough examples of this to warrant
refining this blacklist somehow.
