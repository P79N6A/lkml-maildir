Hopefully everyone is back from linux.conf.au and is caught up on email
now.  Is there a reason modversions imposes this small symbol name
length?  Unfortunately I have modules that have longer exported symbol
names and this prevents them from loading on kernels that have
modversions enabled.  Of course they load just fine when modversions is
disabled.  I can't just shorten my symbol names because they are
exported and other modules are using them.
