hm, and your CPA queue is no bisectable, due to:
  Subject: Undo pat cpa patch
  From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
  Going to implement this differently
    commit 5ec5c5a2302ca8794da03f8bedec931a2a814ae9

       patches/x86-pat-cpa_i386.patch
could you please make your queue bisectable?
Also, did you actually try to port your queue ontop of the cleanups 
patch? There's an easy technique: first do an undo patch, then apply 
your patch, then apply the re-do patch. Whatever rejects come from the 
re-do patch can be dropped from the cleanup. Continue with this until 
all patches are covered. Then generate the undo+your-old-patch+redo 
patch into a single your-new-patch.
