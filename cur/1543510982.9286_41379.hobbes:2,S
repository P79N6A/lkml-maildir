Subject: 2.3.18 link error, yellowfin + via-rhine

A compile of 2.3.18ac9 (probably also plain 2.3.18) gives this link error
when configured with both via-rhine and yellowfin drivers:
...
        -o vmlinux
drivers/net/net.a(via-rhine.o)(.data+0x60): multiple definition of `kernel_version'
drivers/net/net.a(yellowfin.o)(.data+0x64): first defined here
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
...
On an unrelated note, why does 'make modules' produce a modules/NET_MISC_MODULES
containing ipv4.o when no modules are built (and in particular, not ipv4.o)?
The modules directory is otherwise empty.  Granted, there is no need to run
'make modules' for a monolithic kernel, but perhaps there is some small
build issue here.
