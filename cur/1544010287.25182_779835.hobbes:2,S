i have no objections against the bits - just the sparseirq complication 
came in. A lot of effort went into irq/sparseirq's io_apic.c changes and 
cleanup.
So to do this cleanly, i merged those bits into cpus4096 and the 
x86/reboot bits as well - now the plan would be for Mike to send a 
(rebased) series against that base. I tried a plain merge and the 
conflicts in io_apic.c were a horrendous 76 rejects due to the 
irq/sparseirq interaction. Also, some of the commits subjects looked a 
bit raw so this bit of the tree needs to be redone.
(Note that the existing cpumask-base+scheduler bits in cpus4096 are 
golden already and we dont have to touch them in any way, it's just the 
new x86 bits and new cpumask infrastructure bits that look odd or 
clashy.)
