Turns out this is due to the reworked buffer/page sleep/wakeup code in
recent -mm's.  If the journal timer wakes kjournald while kjournald is
waiting on a read of a journal indirect block, kjournald just plunges ahead
with a still-locked, non-uptodate buffer.  Which it treats as an I/O error,
and things don't improve from there.
This should fix.
