[please CC me on trident patches]
/home/muli/kernel/trident/trident.hg/sound/oss/trident.c: In function `ali_reset_5451':
/home/muli/kernel/trident/trident.hg/sound/oss/trident.c:4128: `pdev' undeclared (first use in this function)
/home/muli/kernel/trident/trident.hg/sound/oss/trident.c:4128: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
/home/muli/kernel/trident/trident.hg/sound/oss/trident.c:4128: for each function it appears in.)
I'll fix it up and resubmit. Thanks for the patch!
Cheers,
Muli
