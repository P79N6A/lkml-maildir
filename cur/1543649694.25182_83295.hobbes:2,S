It does affect UP systems.
A quick look at /proc/rcu in a leaky system indicated that somehow
despite having a batch of RCUs, they are not getting started.
 /* Fake initialization required by compiler */
@@ -106,10 +106,11 @@ static void rcu_start_batch(long newbatc
 		rcu_ctrlblk.maxbatch = newbatch;
 	}
 	if (rcu_batch_before(rcu_ctrlblk.maxbatch, rcu_ctrlblk.curbatch) ||

 }
Either find_first_bit() is not returning NR_CPUS when the bitmask has no
bit set or memcpy is not working on the UP version of cpu_online_map. Will
dig a little bit more.
Thanks
