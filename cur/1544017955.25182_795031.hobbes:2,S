| Following this logic, we can report that, say, SIG_DFL'ed SIGWINCH is always
| ignored by any task, not only by init?
Small difference with SIGWINCH though. SIGWINCH default action applies
to all processes. But the special behavior for SIGKILL only applies to
init. But yes, its an old oddity.

Ok.

I can't prove the opposite either. Will go with the majority...
Roland, Eric, Bastian. Any comments ? Should I send patches 1-6 to akpm ?
