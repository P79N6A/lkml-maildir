True enough.  But empirically, I have noticed that very few non-Red-Hat
users manage to confuse "Linux x.y" with "XXX Linux x.y" (I don't think
I've ever seen a Debian user do this, for example), whereas a lot of
Red Hat users do.  I think it's a combination of RH's overall brand
recognition and the type of users they attract a lot of.  I'm not
saying RH is the AOL of distros, but their customers sometimes make me
think this.
