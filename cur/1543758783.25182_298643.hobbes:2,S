Ok, that's acceptable to me, but realize that this puts a bigger burden
on the maintainers to queue up patches for you.  It's not that big of a
deal, just something to be aware of.
Speaking of which, does this mean I shouldn't hit you with all of my
pending stuff?  I know some of the other subsystem maintainers have a
lot of stuff queued up too.  Should we start this new numbering scheme
as of today?  Or wait until 2.6.13?
thanks,
