Hi!
From 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/5103
``Hyper-Threading, as currently implemented on Intel Pentium Extreme
Edition, Pentium 4, Mobile Pentium 4, and Xeon processors, suffers from
a serious security flaw," Colin explains. "This flaw permits local
information disclosure, including allowing an unprivileged user to steal
an RSA private key being used on the same machine. Administrators of
multi-user systems are strongly advised to take action to disable
Hyper-Threading immediately."

Is this flaw affects the current stable Linux kernels? Workaround?
Patch?
Thanks.
