With regard to the synchronize_rcu troubles they also be left to the
notifier-user to solve. Certainly having the synchronize_rcu like in
your last incremental patches in _release, will require less
complications (kvm pins the mm so I suppose we could batch the
call_rcu externally too). But _release is not a fast-path for KVM
usage so your V2 is sure ok (and simpler to deal with) too.
For registration synchronize_rcu is the only way, if the notifiers
have to fire synchronously before mmu_notifier_register returns but
that also can be left up to the caller if required (for example KVM
doesn't need that). Otherwise there could be two mmu_notifier_register
and mmu_notifier_register_rcu where the latter calls synchronize_rcu
before returning.
