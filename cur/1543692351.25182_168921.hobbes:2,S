In 2.6.0-test5, the README still says "Make sure you have gcc 2.95.3
available."  It is telling the truth.
SuSE 8.2 includes gcc 3.3 20030226 (prerelease).  Up to the point of
aborting, it diagnoses a ton of "warning: comparison between signed and
unsigned", but nonetheless compiles many source files and continues.  But in
aic7(censored)_core.c, line 76, it diagnoses "warning: `num_chip_names'
defined but not used".  Even though this is also just a warning, obviously
it threatens disastrous consequences  :-s  (sarcasm).  make[3] quits with
Error 1 and make[2] and make[1] quit with Error 2.
(My previous tests of 2.6.0-test[1-5] used the version of gcc that was in
SuSE 8.1.)
