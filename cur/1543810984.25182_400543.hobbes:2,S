I finally got around to doing this and the first two dumps are at the
end of this message.  Many many more were sent to the logs though - as 
one would expect, since we know that in the fault condition this function
is called very frequently without any end in site.
I've put the *full* dump up at
  
http://www.atrad.com.au/~jwoithe/kernel/full_timeout_dump.bz2
if anyone's interested.  Similarly, I moved the dump_stack() call
outside the while() loop and obtained a dump in the case of things
working correctly.  You can grab this from
  
http://www.atrad.com.au/~jwoithe/kernel/dump_loaded_ok.bz2
Oh yes, the dump_stack() call was put *before* the snd_printk() call
when I did the tests.  This makes no practical difference except that it
explains why the output from this came after the dumps.
Over the weekend I'll try to test 2.6.15-rt17 since that's recently come
out.
What next?
