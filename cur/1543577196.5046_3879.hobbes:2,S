I saw oopses in prune_dcache() during umount() of ncpfs circa 6 months
ago. As I was never able to reproduce problem, and it just stopped from
happenning as unexpected as it appeared, I never reported that. And
~2 times I got endless loop in d_prune_aliases() where it somewhat
happened that d_alias list looked like
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 ... (maybe after pruning d_count = 0
                                    entries...)
so it never stopped :-( But it really happened long long ago, I think
that sometime June-September 2000, and couple of logic changed since
then in both ncpfs and vfs.
                                    Best regards,
