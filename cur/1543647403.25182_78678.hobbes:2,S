hugetlbfs update:
CAP_IPC_LOCK is required to utilize hugetlb shm segments, memory
allocation, and other facilities. The following patch does three things:
(1) check capable(CAP_IPC_LOCK) in ->f_ops->mmap
	This may be redundant but it errors out with less state to
	clean up and at least clarifies the fact that checks are
	being performed at the relevant entry points.
(2) check capable(CAP_IPC_LOCK) in hugetlbfs_zero_setup()
	This is called at shmget() time and is an actual potential
	security hole. hugetlb_prefault() does not perform this
	check itself, so it must be done here.
