Hell no.
The typeof is there to make sure we have the right type, and it's simple.
The current ALIGN() macro is efficient as hell (generating just a simple 
mask+add). Turning it into some kind of horrible thing that uses ilog2() 
would be a total mistake.
Also, your ALIGN() macro was broken. That's not how ALIGN() is supposed to 
work.
