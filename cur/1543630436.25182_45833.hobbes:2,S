Is there any way to dynamically load initrd or cdrom permanently as
the root fs when booting from cdrom?
My problem is that I need a reliable way to ALWAYS find the correct
device to mount. Is there any way to make the kernel automagically
mount the cdrom it booted from?
I believe that for example SuSE installer cd does this, but I cannot figure
out how they do it.
If on initrd, I need about 300MB space on the root fs.
If this is not possible, what do I need to modify in the kernel?
