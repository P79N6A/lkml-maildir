	Just curious, why not have it included in the mainstream kernel?
	As for your questions, how does RedHat do it?  I've used RedHat,
and IIRC have had a 'make modules_install' work and install things into
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/*, and everything was happy.  Kernel headers and
such are kind of a pain though, you could be like (I think) the PCMCIA
package and have it ask in an install proggie where the kernel source is..
