I have yet to setup any greylisting for any of my systems yet, but I would
greylist, and if they came back an hour later and was in blacklists, I
wouldn't allow it.  This is one thing greylisting can do for you, defer it
until they are in blacklists.
Of course all rules need to be weighed for the server they are placed on.  I
would do the above on my domain since I'm the only user, I might not on big
ISP.
I have noticed spam from zombies that were not in RBLs when it came in and 5
minutes later, they are in RBLs.
