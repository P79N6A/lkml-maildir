Subject: [patch] disable NMI watchdog by default
there's a new NMI watchdog related problem: KVM crashes on certain 
bzImages because ... we enable the NMI watchdog by default (even if the 
user does not ask for it) , and no other OS on this planet does that so 
KVM doesnt have emulation for that yet. So KVM injects a #GP, which 
crashes the Linux guest:
 general protection fault: 0000 [#1]
 PREEMPT SMP
 Modules linked in:
 CPU:    0
 EIP:    0060:[<c011a8ae>]    Not tainted VLI
 EFLAGS: 00000246   (2.6.20-rc5-rt0 #3)
 EIP is at setup_apic_nmi_watchdog+0x26d/0x3d3
and no, i did /not/ request an nmi_watchdog on the boot command line!
Solution: turn off that darn thing! It's a debug tool, not a 'make life 
harder' tool!!
with this patch the KVM guest boots up just fine.
And with this my laptop (Lenovo T60) also stops its sporadic hard 
hanging (sometimes in acpi_init(), sometimes later during bootup, 
sometimes much later during actual use) as well. It hung with both 
nmi_watchdog=1 and nmi_watchdog=2, so it's generally the fact of NMI 
injection that is causing problems, not the NMI watchdog variant, nor 
any particular bootup code.
The patch is unintrusive.
