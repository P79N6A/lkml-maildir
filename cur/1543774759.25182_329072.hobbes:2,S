no it's not
everything but / and /boot were in LVM

I thing that not having / in LVM saved my datas !

problematic partitions)

in my case, I really thing that there was a problem with pvmove/kmirrord
when it tried to move data when they were being accessed
now, this is just a _wild_ guess after spending the whole afternoon
trying to recover my disks and I have no hard figures to back this 
speculation
I just realized that when I finally let pvmove finish it's work
everything went fine while previously every single attempt to copy data
to a new disk failed one way or another the same way : Oops in the
kernel
