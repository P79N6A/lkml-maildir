Hmm. AFAICS this also implies that one would have to put /all/ drivers
for /any/ hardware possibly plugged in at boot time on the initramfs.
Or will /sbin/hotplug provide the ability to just put requests it
can't resolve with the modules on the initramfs into some sort of
queue file, which is read by /sbin/coldplug (or whatever) later on in
the boot process to load drivers for those from the real root fs?

Having to put all drivers for all PCI/USB/whatever stuff on the
initramfs will likely be a problem (regarding disk space) for people
who need to boot the kernel from a floppy disk without having to
change disks during boot (think of nfsroot without etherboot).
