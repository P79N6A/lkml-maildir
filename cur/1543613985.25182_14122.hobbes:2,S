Hi,
 i am having exactly the same problem! One of my servers
locks up once in a while and i was reading your post and i thought it might
be
the same problem with me, and it indeed is.
The server consists of:
Supermicro 370DLE motherbord
Dual 1Ghz Pentium III CPU's
1.5 Gig memory (highmem enabled)
2 ide software raid-0's and a scsi linux disk.
My systems also hangs after a short while when running such a script.
And it just hangs in the same way every now and then (mostly after 1 to 2
weeks
uptime). The HDD-led burns constantly when the system locks up.
SysRq aint responding when it locks up neither.
I have not been able to try without SMP support yet, altho i will (hopefully
today)
test it. I have been having this problem for a some time now and did not
solve it yet.
I will aslo try the nmi_watchdog=1 and kdb, if i get some more information i
will mail it.
