	The kset exists so we can put the logmask directory underneath
it, as you notice in the next item.

	Well, what's a kobj_attribute do differently?  I mean, logmask
is one object, distinct from the o2cb toplevel, and it has multiple
attributes.  That's pretty standard sysfs, no?
	Oh, I see, kobj_attribute wraps struct attribute the way we do
with "mlog_attribute".  Pretty much everyone did it themselves back in
the day, with a set of hand-built "turn struct attribute into struct
foo_attribute" version of show() and store().  But then you have ot wrap
that in our own attribute anyway...well, not for the mlog one, I don't
think, as it keys off the name.  So perhaps we could remove "struct
mlog_attribute" and replace it with "struct kobj_attribute" for a
zero-sum change.  Not pressing, but certainly not a problem.
	But I'm still not understanding what you mean by "1 kobject for
the directory".  We have one kobject for the "logmask" directory, and
then attributes for each log type.  I don't see how that would change.
Are you suggesting that we move the log attributes up one level,
eliminating the "logmask" subdir?  That is, "/sys/fs/o2cb/logmask/DLM"
becomes "/sys/fs/o2cb/DLM"?  That won't work, because then "ls
/sys/fs/o2cb/logmask" is no longer a valid way to discover all the log
masks - "interface_revision" isn't a log mask :-)
	Or do you mean something else?
