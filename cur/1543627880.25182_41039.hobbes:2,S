  Is this positive or negative on performance? If you have a system
getting so many interrupts that one CPU can't handle them, obviously there
is a gain. However, by thrashing the cache of all CPUs instead of just one
you have some memory performance cost.
  I first looked at this for a mainframe vendor who decided that putting
all the interrupts in one CPU was better. That was then, this is now, but
I am curious about metrics, like real and system time doing a kernel
compile, etc.
