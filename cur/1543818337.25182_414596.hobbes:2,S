It is mentioned in the Help text after one enters '/'.

I don't see any need to limit it to 70 columns wide.  It knows how to
scroll left/right (using arrow keys).

Nope, the only thing that the "reduced" search excludes atm is SELECT info.
From my original email, as you quoted above, the less-verbose '\' search
only eliminates the Selects: and Selected by: output, and the UNIX
config symbols don't have any SELECT info.
I don't know if we are converging any, but I made a new patch:
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/patches/menuconfig-search2b.patch
This one changes the default '/' search to NOT be verbose and the
new, extended '\' search to be verbose.  The non-verbose search omits
Selects:, Selected by:, and Location: information.
