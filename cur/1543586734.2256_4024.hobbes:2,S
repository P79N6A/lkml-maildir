Hi,
I wrote a framebuffer driver for all NeoMagic PCI chips
ported from current XFree driver, not based on the AFAIK
unfinished driver of Ani Joshi or Helge Deller.
This is version 0.2 with some little TODOs like
module parameters or kernel parameter parsing;
it's tested with NM2200 and NM2380.
The patch is against 2.4.3, please test the driver,
merge into kernel tree would be appreciated.
I'm not on the list, so do a Cc to me, please.
Best regards,
