I don't think it's that easy. If the computer wakes up again, devices have
to be reinitialised in the right order, e.g. iSCSI needs a working network
stack and devices. Another problem is how to properly shutdown the
machine. Scripts now "know" that nfs requires the network, but how does
the script find out, that /dev/sdb2 is an iSCSI device, so that it can
properly unmount the device, before the network is shutdown?
bye, Roman
