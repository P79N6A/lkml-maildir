Right now I maintain a kernel tree on linuxhq to which I apply all of 
the patches posted on the kernel mailing list (without filtering at 
all).  I don't think this was very useful, so I was thinking about 
simply providing a list of all maintained (but currently not applied) 
patches -- things like Rik van Riel's VM, and perhaps put up all of the 
patches being developed by Universities and other research institutions 
willing to share their stuff.
I didn't think providing patches needed to compile would be very useful, 
  because it seems that many people do this already (most notably, Alan 
Cox does this for Marcelo, and Dave Jones does this for Linus).
I inherited linuxhq.com and would like to make it into something more 
useful.  Since kernelnewbies does such a wonderful job catering to the 
newbies, I figured that linuxhq needed a new niche (and I needed 
something funner to do with my time).  So please let me know what types 
of things you kernel folk would like to see but have no time to do 
themselves, and I can accomodate.
Some ideas:
[1] Performance Measurements.  (Though I would need some help from the 
kernel community to identify which suites are the most useful to run the 
kernels against).
[2] Kernel Programming Documentation.  This would mostly document the 
kernel API, and important kernel data structures, as well as "good 
habits" in kernel development -- like "don't use virt_to_bus use 
blah,blah,blah".  Information like this might be useful to kernel 
janitors.  (This probably exists already).
[3] Necessary patches for each release.
I will do any and maybe all things that folks find useful...
other suggestions also welcome.
