I guess not so true. Because debian had always compatibility libs. So I
guess when they bump the libc revision on sid, they provide a compat
library at the same time so that you're able to run the old binaries.
But don't nail me down on this one. But for the mean time you should be
good with the packages I provided in the previous e-mail for sure.
