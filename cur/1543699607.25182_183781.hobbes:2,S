Well, it "does" in my tree, but test11 doesn't (except in the
broken DFU path).  That's likely a source of some of Duncan's
confusion -- my bad, sorry.

I'd split step 4 into "4a" (device descriptors) and "4b"
(config descriptors) ... and then re-factor so 1..4a is
the same code as normal khubd enumeration.  That's what
I was looking at a while back.  If you like, I'll finish
that and forward.
That would also reduce the length of time the address0_sem
is held, eliminating a deadlock when a driver probe() from
khubd calls "physical" reset_device() after firmware update.
You'll notice that today's "physical reset" codepath doesn't
work the same way as the normal "just connected" reset.  Up
through step (4a) there's no point to that -- it's all just
potential bugginess, there's no good reason I can see to
have those codepaths do the same thing differently.

I think that ALL errors in that reset path should be handled
the same way:  fail the reset, mark the device as gone, hand
the device to some task context ... and in that task context,
disconnect all the drivers, clean up sysfs, and re-enumerate
the device.  (Without dropping power to the port; we don't
want to need to re-download any firmware.)  Maybe there
should be exceptiona if the old state wasn't CONFIGURED.
The notion of a device that's "partially reset" sounds like
bugs waiting to happen.
