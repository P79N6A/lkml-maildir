You start getting into some pretty serious mindset battles on
this particular road. For starters, the "hooks" have to be
authoritative if you want them properly switchable, and I'm not
going to show you the scars I got the last time I proposed
authoritative hooks. Next you'll have to deal with defining what is
security behavior and what isn't. You wouldn't believe the debates
over the security implications, or lack thereof, of disk quotas.
Unless you're willing to take the approach that every conditional
in the kernel is a potential security checkpoint you are going to
miss someone's requirement and if you're willing to propose that,
well, let's just say that Linus was right about security people.

The API issue cannot be solved if LSMs are going to implement
different behaviors. A reasonable subset can be addressed using
the POSIX P1003.1e/2c MAC definition plus the TSIG APIs. It is
unfortunate that SELinux has gone in a completely different
direction.

A specific table configuration sounds an awful lot like a
specific SELinux Policy. Either way, your configuration is
going to be large and may not implement anything rational.

In addition to tools, there's the labor and money intensive Common
Criteria Evaluation Process.
