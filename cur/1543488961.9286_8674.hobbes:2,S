Fast retransmit then increase cwnd by the 3 packets that are supposed to
be received in the receiver, while instead we have dropped such packets. I
think that fast-retrans is not good to deal with userspace shrunk of the
rcvbuf so probably the best approch is to wait for the rto-expiration as
we was used to do.
