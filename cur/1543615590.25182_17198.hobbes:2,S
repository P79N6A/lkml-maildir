Ok. It would be really nice to know if the -aa patches do any good at your
configs. Andrea has possibly done something on the issue. But let me take this
chance to state an open word: last time Andrea talked about his personal
hardware I couldn't really believe it - because it was so ridiculously small. I
wonder if anyone at SuSE management _does_ actually read this list and think
about how someone can do a good job without good equipment. If you really want
to do something groundbreaking about highmem you have to have a _box_. A box
_somewhere_ in the world or a patch for highmem-in-lowmem is not really the
same thing. Even Schumacher wouldn't have won formula one by sitting inside a
Fiat Uno with a patched speedometer.

You are right.

Hm, I have about 24GB of NFS traffic every day, which may be too less. What
exactly are you seeing in this case (logfiles etc.)?

Hopefully nobody does this here, I don't.

The number of people is not really interesting for me, as the boxes get bigger
every day it is only a matter of time to see more people with lots of GB (as an
example).

How could you ? ;-))
