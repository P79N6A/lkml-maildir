Because that is the API I inherited.  To create an MD array, you open
/dev/mdX and issue some IOCTLs.  Originally I think the devices were
all created at boot/module-load time much like they still are for
loop.c.  But when Al Viro did all that work with kmap and blkdev_get
ages ago he changed it so they didn't have to pre-created but rather
were created on-the-fly by an attempt to open the block device (this
calls in to md_probe which does the add_disk).
This creates a deep disconnect between udev and md.
udev expects a device to appear first, then it created the
device-special-file in /dev.
md expect the device-special-file to exist first, and then created the
device on the first open.

Yes... the device cannot disappear until no-one is using it, so no-one
will be interested in it going away.

Yes, I'll get rid of the online/offline events and just put in a
CHANGE when the array becomes available.
I'm still a bit concerned about the open->add->open infinite loop.
If anyone opens /dev/mdX while it isn't active (e.g. to check if it is
active), that will (given a patch that I would like to include) cause
and ADD event which will cause udev to start it's loop again.
Can we make udev ignore ADD for md and only watch for CHANGE?
Thanks,
