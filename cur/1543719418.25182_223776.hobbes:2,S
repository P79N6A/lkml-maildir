OK, I found a reasonable looking box at 
    
http://www.bzboyz.com/store/product4170.html
ASUS K8V basic, AMD 64 2800+, $346.  Gotta love hardware prices.
Next question is what distro you'd prefer to be the build OS.
We typically use Red Hat, in this case that would be Fedora Core 1.
Since that was one of the first (?) distros for x86-64 there shouldn't
be any libc issues, right?  What we want is to use the _oldest_ possible
distro/libc that works going forward.  So is Fedora 1 OK with you?  Any
nay sayers?
