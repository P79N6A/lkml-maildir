I didn't hear the mips32 argument, but for NUMA-Q nonlinear is
definitely the last thing you want, there is no discontinuity in the ram
in each node. nonlinaer can make sense _only_ when there are ram holes
in the middle of the per-numa-node-mem_map. NUMA-Q has the need of
spreading the zone_normal over the different nodes and nonlinaer is
definitely not needed and it won't help in achieving that object, NUMA-Q
infact needs discontigmem topology description to allow the numa
optimizations so it cannot use nonlinear anyways to handle the holes
between the numa-nodes.
