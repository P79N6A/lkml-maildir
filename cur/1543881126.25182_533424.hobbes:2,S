Thanks for the report. In your case, you've done the testing I require; that 
for your workloads everything works as you'd desire it without obvious 
problems. Just keeping an eye on newer versions if you have the time and 
inclination and making sure that everything stays as you expect it would be 
the most helpful thing you can do.
Thanks!
