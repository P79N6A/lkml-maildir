I presume that if you do write(), the Single Unix Standard allows the
data to remain dirty in RAM for an arbitrary duration too.
If I write() a file I expect it to be automatically written to disk
within a few minutes at most, where that is plausible.

It's a quality of implementation issue if data can remain dirty in RAM
forever without ever being flushed.
Can this really happen with normal open/mmap/munmap/close usage, or
does it only occur with long-lived processes like innd which mmap a
file, dirty the pages but never munmap them?
If the former case does happen, I'd say we're failing on quality of
implementation.  If it's only the latter case, though, fair enough: the
application writer will have to use msync().
