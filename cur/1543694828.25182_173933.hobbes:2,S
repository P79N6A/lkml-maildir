I don't know the specific drive electronics either.
It has also been many years since i studied the electrical
side of this stuff.
Undervolt, or voltage sag under load, is worse than
overvolt.  Overvolt can be caught with fuses or voltage
regulators neither of which can do aught with an undervolt.
If overvolt does get through things run just a bit warmer.
Undervolt on the other hand can cause VCC to drop to the
level where it can no longer represent a logic high value
but is instead in the range where it is neither 0 nor 1 and
logic gates start spending too much time in the transition
range where they act like amplifiers.  When that happens not
only do you get data corruption but things start heating up
big-time and the current drain goes way up.
