However, ALSA _has_ defaults for these controls, which I believe are 
usually "off" or "zero". All I'm suggesting is that these defaults are 
plainly suboptimal for emu10k1, and probably other cards to which this 
statement simply does not apply. Shipping defaults is one thing, but shipping 
useless defaults is quite another. We have policy all over the kernel for 
providing "sane defaults" e.g. filesystem mount options.

True, I suppose if the mixers aren't even vaguely compatible across 
hardware, "zero" is your best bet. I still see people reporting bugs (such as 
this) where the distro has failed them. -F is not a complete solution.
