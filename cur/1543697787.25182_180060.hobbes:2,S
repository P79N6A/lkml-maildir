Hi,
I've found a bug in the 2.4.20 kernel (might have appeared before), that if
the PG_reserved flag is set on a page, its reference count will be
incremented but won't be decremented.  This is due to the wrong order of
lazy if tests in __free_pages().
I have two questions:
1.  How do I report it?  I found no maintainer for MM in MAINTAINERS
2.  I'm writing a module that gets pages (via __get_free_pages) and holds
them throughout its lifetime.  Where must I check if this page can be taken
from under me, without using the reserved bit?  In other words, if I want to
make sure the behavior is the same with or without the reserved bit, what
must I maintain?
Thanks,
Amir.
