I've got the same error, this is because they added a new setup structure
for all net devices.
I added : extern int slhc_install(void) in setup.c, after that it compiled,
with some warning messages though.. :)
I haven't experienced any problems with adding that.
Hope you can get it working too.
Kind Regards,
