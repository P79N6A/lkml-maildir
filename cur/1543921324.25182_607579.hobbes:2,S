Yes, I find this a painful limitation too.
Sparc64 used to dump the registers on all active cpus for show_regs()
via a cross-call, and this was incredibly useful.  But I disabled that
as soon as I started playing with Niagara because at 32 cpus and
larger the output is just too voluminous to be useful.
What might be appropriate is just to get a one-line program counter
dump on every cpu via some new sysrq keystroke.
