Unless Stephen says otherwise, my understanding is that a crash during
journal recovery will just mean the journal is replayed again at the next
recovery.  Because the ext3 journal is just a series of data blocks to
be copied into the filesystem (rather than "actions" to be done), it
doesn't matter how many times it is done.  The recovery flags are not
reset until after the journal replay is completed.
Cheers, Andreas
