You have a mismatch between your wireless-tools, your kernel, and/or
wpa_supplicant.  WE-21 uses the _real_ ssid length rather than the
kludge of hacking off the last byte used previously.  Please ensure that
your tools, driver, and kernel are using WE-21.
'cat /proc/net/wireless' should tell you what your kernel is using.
Getting the driver WE is a bit harder and you may have to look at the
source.
