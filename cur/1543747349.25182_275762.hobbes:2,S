We do _not_ move stuff over that is questionable.
I thought that was clear by now. The rules are:
 - we only move things that _have_ to move
 - we don't break existing programs, and no "but they are broken already" 
   is not an excuse.
 - we only move things where that _particular_ move can be shown to be 
   beneficial.
No whole-sale moves. No "let's break things that I think are broken". No 
"let's change things because we can".
Well-defined moves. Both in content _and_ in reason.
