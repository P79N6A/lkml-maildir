Subject: [PATCH 1/2] msi: Invert the sense of the MSI enables.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/25/6

Currently we blacklist known bad msi configurations which means we
keep getting MSI enabled on chipsets that either do not support MSI,
or MSI is implemented improperly.  Since the normal IRQ routing
mechanism seems to works even when MSI does not, this is a bad default
and causes non-functioning systems for no good reason.
So this patch inverts the sense of the MSI bus flag to only enable
MSI on known good systems.  I am seeding that list with the set of
chipsets with an enabled hypertransport MSI mapping capability.  Which
is as close as I can come to an generic MSI enable.  So for actually
using MSI this patch is a regression, but for just having MSI enabled
in the kernel by default things should just work with this patch
applied.
People can still enable MSI on a per bus level for testing by writing
to sysfs so discovering chipsets that actually work (assuming we are
using modular drivers) should be pretty straight forward.

+This at least ensures users will have a working system using older

+So to enable MSI support on a particular chipset we need a MSI quirk

+this case, MSI has to be enabled on all bridges that are capable of
+transform MSI messages into irqs.  It is achieved by setting

 Some bridges actually support dynamic MSI support enabling/disabling
 by changing some bits in their PCI configuration space (especially
 the Hypertransport chipsets such as the nVidia nForce and Serverworks
-HT2000). It may then be required to update the NO_MSI flag on the
+HT2000). It may then be required to update the MSI flag on the
 corresponding devices in the sysfs hierarchy. To enable MSI support
