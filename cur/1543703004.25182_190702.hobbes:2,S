This change is probably not going to go into 2.6.X anytime soon anyway,
so what's your thoughts on doing this "right" - getting MD moved into
DM ?
That would solve the problem, as I see it.
I'm not currently involved in either of those development efforts, but I
thought I'd bring your attention to the DM/MD issue - there was some
talk about it in the past.
Also, since DM will do on-line resizing and we want MD to do this as
well some day, I really think this is the way to be going.  Getting
partition support on MD devices will solve a problem now, but for the
long run I really think MD should be a part of DM.
Anyway, that's my 0.02 Euro on that issue.

I think this one touches the DM issue as well.
So, how about Adaptec and IBM get someone to move MD into DM, and while
you're at it, add hot resizing and hot conversion between RAID levels  :)
2.7.1?  ;)
Jokes aside, I'd like to hear your oppinions on this longer-term
perspective on things...
The RAID conversion/resize code for userspace exists already, and it
works except for some cases with RAID-5 and disks of non-equal size,
where it breaks horribly (fixable bug though).
