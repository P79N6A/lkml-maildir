 One of the great things about Linux (or at least I think so) kernel
 is it's incredibly verbose startup.
 If you have a configured network, boot messages WILL tell you
 what driver is controlling that card.  If built as a module
 lsmod WILL tell you.

 Then we need better descriptions in the CML2 rules.

 ls /proc/sys/net/khttpd
