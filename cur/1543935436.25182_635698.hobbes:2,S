Use tune2fs to deactivate checking.

Modify the init scripts or use another distro.

Don't use udev then. Good old static dev works fine if you have a fixed
set of devices.

You're using the sil3112 driver? Edit its blacklist and remove the
entry for your drive. That gives you the usual speed.

Gradually upgrade to 2.6.15, 2.6.16...

Check your tool-chain. Many people compile recent kernels with no problems.

Use a kernel.org version.

Nobody forces you to use udev. Moreover, you can write your own udev
rules that match your expectations.

You're not ranting about Linux but about your Distro. Complain on
