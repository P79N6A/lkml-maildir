The extents format doesn't need any support from mke2fs.  Currently this
is activated by a mount option "-o extents", so it won't be used until
a system administrator actively enables it.

Yes, completely compatible (author is the same person).  We have all been
working to get these improvements into the vanilla kernel so that everyone
can benefit from the improved performance.  These patches are just the
start - the mballoc and delalloc patches are follow-on patches, but they
do not affect the on-disk format just the in-memory implementation of
block allocation.

They were posted to the ext2-devel mailing list previously, or you can
download a patched RPM at 
ftp://ftp.lustre.org/pub/lustre/other/e2fsprogs/
(the extent support is making its way into the official e2fsprogs also).
Cheers, Andreas
