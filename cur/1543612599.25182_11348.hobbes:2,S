Man you guys are NUTS.
But this is a fun conversation so I'm going to join in.

I may be a total tool here, but this question is really bugging me :
What, if any, advantages does your proposal have over (say) a Beowulf
cluster?  Why does having the cluster in one box seem a better solution
than having a Beowulf type cluster with a shared Network filesystem?
You've declared everything to be separate, so that I can't see
what's not separate any more :)
Is it just an issue of shared memory?  You want to be able to share
memory between processes on separate systems at high speed?  Why
not Myrinet then?  Yeah, it's slower, but the order of magnitude
reduction in cost compared to a 64 way SMP box makes this a trivial
decision in my books....
Or am I missing something really obvious here????
