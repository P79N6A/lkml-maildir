If a clueless users voice counts for anything: I couldn't agree more.  
A failed resume is a near catastrophy if you use and trust swsusp. And
how could it ever be useful if you don't?
I would much prefer a very long (indefinite) timeout, and to manually
have to force a reboot without resume.  This is an absolutely last
resort and there is no need whatsoever to automatically go there.
Maybe that even would give me a chance to fix some hardware problem
causing the timeout, and then retry the resume.
Please do everything possible to ensure that a resume will never fail
unnecessarily.  I can't see how some arbitrary timeout could be
necessary. 
Just my 2 øre.
