OK, thanks for the summary.

I have (or had) no insight into the problem analysis, just that there
is a big problem.  Fortunately you and others know that too and
are working on it.
You asked what I (or anyone) would consider the real problem.
I can't really say since I have no performance/profile data to base
it on.  There has been some noise about (not) providing mirror services
for distros.  Is that a big cpu/memory consumer?  If so, then is that
something that kernel.org could shed over some N (6 ?) months?
I understand not dropping it immediately, but it seems to be more of
a convenience rather than something related to kernel development.
