while i agree with exposing this counter, /proc/interrupts is the wrong 
place for this - please add it to /proc/timer_list instead, that's where 
we put all the time related debug info - it already has per cpu printout 
sections. And that way it's much simpler as well. (no need to modify all 
the architectures)
