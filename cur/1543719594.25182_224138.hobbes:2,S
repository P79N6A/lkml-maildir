Hello,
I just upgrade my Compaq Prolient Server to 2.6.x.  This system is mostly
a http server and does not have a keyboard or mouse attached.  This
system hangs on reboot, when generating SSL keys due to /dev/random
having zero entropy.
It is my understanding that /dev/random uses the keyboard, mouse and
block devices to generate entropy.  Since this system does not have a
keyboard or mouse, I am having to rely upon the cpqarray (block) driver
for entropy.  It appears that in the 2.4.x kernel somebody added the
SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM flag to request_irq() in cpqarray.c to fix this
problem.  Below is a patch against 2.6.6, which corrects this issue.
Best Regards,
--George
