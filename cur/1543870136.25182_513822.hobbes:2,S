openSUSE 10.3 Alpha and KDE-3.5.6, xorg-x11-7.2. KDE is setup not to
require a password to unlock, but it asks for password. When the screen
unlocks, kwin is gone with no errors logged in /var/log/kdm or
/var/log/messages. No problems with 2.6.20.
Same problem on openSUSE 10.2 x86_64, KDE-3.5.5 and 2.6.21-rc2.
Regards
Sid.
