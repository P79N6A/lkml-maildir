Chances are you have downrev firmware on your PERC 2/SC card, and there
should be some messages printed on the console when the megaraid driver
tries to load, telling you to update your firmware, and hangs the system
at that point (else data corruption could ensue).
In any case, please see 
http://domsch.com/linux
 for an easy link to recent
firmware, and you should be set.
Thanks,
Matt
