I am not knowledgeable of the granularity of timers under Linux.
However, I headed a project which was a complex real-time data
acquisition and control system. Data was acquired and a great deal of
processing done it in a slice of time, which was limited by real-time
contraints. It is in production use all over the Western Hemisphere.
Linux works better than either of the other 2 unices that we've used for
this task. This is accomplished to a large degree by a carefully
designed priority schema. This combined with the POSIX real-time
scheduling, which is in place, assures that the application processes
will be executed in a timely fashion.
This may be something that you wish to consider in your judgement of
Linux as a process control platform.
