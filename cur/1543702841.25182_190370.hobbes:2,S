Erm, well, _I_ know. But I assume you meant this message mainly for the 
public.

You tell me. I actually stopped adapting sisfb for a couple of months 
during the 2.5 development cycle - I could not keep up with the speed of 
substantial changes either.

Isn't a large part of the fbcon/dev stuff in current 2.6 broken anyway? 
Could it become worse by merging James' current changes? But I guess 
this question - as well as the rest of your message - is for James to 
answer.
If the lastest and greatest of the fbdev stuff isn't merged with 2.6.2, 
I will revert the interface changes in sisfb and send a patch which 
works with the then-current vanilla kernel.
