Wait, that's exactly Rusty's point (I think :)
These symbols are exported because they're needed by protocols.
If they weren't available to everyone then it would be difficult
to start writing new protocols.

Can you be more precise?

Again, if it's used by decnet then it sounds like it should be
exported because new protocol families may need them.
So based on the network code at least I'm kind of starting to
agree with Rusty now: if a symbol is needed by more than one
in-tree module chances are we want it to be exported for all.
Although I admit I haven't examined your examples elsewhere.
Cheers,
