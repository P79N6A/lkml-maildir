That is why a readdir shouldn't even include .snapshot.  Only explicitly
asking to open .snapshot should give it to you.  That way tar can't
accidentally include it unless you specifically asked it to go into
.snapshot and archive the contents.
So by hidden it means completely hidden, not just left out by the shell
and the unix conventions.
Of course backup tools have to know about this, but then again backup
tools have to know about all sorts of low level filesystem stuff that
normal tools don't.
