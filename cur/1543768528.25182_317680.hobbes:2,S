Subject: Need kernel patch to compile with Intel compiler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

In this mailing list archive I found a discussion on how to compile
kenrel 2.6.x with Intel C++ compiler, but it was a bit old, and only
kernel patch for version 2.6.5 or around so can be found.   As mine is
HT enabled, I want newer one.
Does anyone know where to find it, or how to make it?
regards,
