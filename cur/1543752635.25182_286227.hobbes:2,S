I'm pretty sure that you only get a 3 second delay on the specific
console.  I've mistyped my root password on tty1, and switched to tty2
to log in before the delay was up.
as a test, switch to vc/0 and enter 'root', then press enter.  Type a
bogus password.
Switch to vc/1, and enter 'root', then press enter.  Type your real root
password.
Go back to vc/0 and hit enter so you submit your false password, then
immediately switch to vc/1 and hit enter.
You should get a bash shell and have enough time to switch to vc/0 and
see it still waiting for a second or two, before returning "login
incorrect."
Automating an attack on about 10 different ssh connections shouldn't be
a problem.  Just keep creating them.
