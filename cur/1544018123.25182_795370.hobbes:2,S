firstly, this bit should move into a helper function. Also, why dont you 
do the need_resched() check first (it's very lighweight) - and thus only 
do the heavy ops (get-task-struct & tasklist_lock unlock) if that is set?
But most importantly, isnt the logic above confused? --max_count will 
reach zero exactly once, and then we'll loop for a long time.
