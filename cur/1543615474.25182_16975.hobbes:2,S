No, that's not true.  We're passing a pointer as an argument.  It is a
valid pointer - dereferencing it may not be valid, but the pointer is
perfectly legal!  There is nothing wrong with this case.  The problem
lies in calling a function whose name is special to GCC and to the C
language, which GCC can then transform.
