I can assure you I was never having DRM or anything like this in mind
nor making fundamental changes to the IDE layer. It was just that
++bi_idx that bugged me. Must be a misunderstanding, sorry. :)
The only thing I'm having on my website is a device-mapper target that
does basically the same as cryptoloop tries to. It's just about
encrypting sensitive data on top of any other device, nothing else.
