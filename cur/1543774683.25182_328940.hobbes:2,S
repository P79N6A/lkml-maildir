hm. Nothing should starve the NMI watchdog. Only a nasty, complete 
kernel crash or a hardware failure can lock up the box in a way that not 
even the NMI watchdog can get some message out to the console. Just in 
case, could you try the latest patch (-50-24 or later), there were a 
couple of bugs fixed.
