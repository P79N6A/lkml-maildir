If you excuse the nitpicking:  The patch description is not very
precise.  You don't have to go through all options in the IEEE 1394 menu
if you don't need them.  Once the first entry in the menu is disabled,
all other options vanish.  (Of course with your patch you don't have to
enter the submenu in the first place if you switch it off.)  I suppose
it's the same with some more of the menus you edited.
But even though, keeping such groups of options in a menu _without_ the
possibility to switch the menu off helps to focus on these options.
Less clutter in the display one is working with in a moment.  IMO,
kernel configuration is not a sport where speed matters but a task where
we want to present the user a very cleaned-up, calm display.
In general though, I'm impartial on this kind of change.
