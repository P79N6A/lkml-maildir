Or, if we decide for non-logical, how about naming them by the funniest /
silliest pet name (kinda like O'Reilly and the Camel and Bat books) that
Linus used in that cycle.  For example, the 2.1.* could be the "basted
turkey" release, or whatever Linus called the one (2.1.130 or so) that came
out around Thanksgiving....
