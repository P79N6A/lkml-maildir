Yes.  Well, I can't speak for Miles on Ubuntu, but I have ipw2200
on openSUSE 10.2 (using ifplugd if that matters), and have to build
my 2.6.20-rc3 with CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y in order to get an IP
address (no idea whether it's a hald issue in my case).  Likewise
needed CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y with 2.6.19-rc-mm on SuSE 10.1.
