Hello,
I have an
 hdc: HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GSA-4120B, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
from LG. My kernel is a vanilla 2.6.11 with packet writing enabled. I noticed, 
however, that I can mount and write a CD-RW udf formatted with 
# cdrwtool -d /dev/hdc -q
without the need of the pktcdvd driver (with the module unloaded, indeed), 
simply with
# mount -t udf /dev/hdc /mnt
I thought that this was a property only of DVD+RW and DVDRAM media. Am I 
missing something here? What is then the use of pktcdvd driver?
Thanks in advice,
Joao Luis M. Assirati.
