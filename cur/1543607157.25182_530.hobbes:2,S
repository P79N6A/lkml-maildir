I have seen this error on every 2.4 and 2.3.99 kernel I have used
on every machine I use.  The machiens I have used it on are all IBM
Intelistation or IBM PC300GL machines.  Whenever the keyboard interrupt
it lost, I either loose the character I just typed (most common), or
get a duplicate of the character.  If it happens when I hit shift, the
shift can get stuck since the release is lost.  Same for ALT and CTRL.
It never happened with any 2.2 kernel.  The keyboard always comes back
after loosing the one character (although I think I have had it die for
about 1 second a few times, although not lately).
