Enlightenment is the last thing one gets in mailing lists, especially
linux-scsi.

When I submitted this code last year in this mailing list, none of these
values were set to 1.  Both cmd_per_lun and can_queue were/are set to the same
value, which is computed dynamically from the capabilities of the controller.
I've no idea who set "cmd_per_lun" to 1 and when.
I've no idea who set "can_queue" to anything other than what I
initilize it in my code as submitted last year.

I just did some performance testing (of the code as I maintain it)
using your "bogodisk-0.5.2" and I get identical graph as your "green"
graph (but for different disk of course).
BTW, you need to print doubles as "%f" since using "%.2f" gives
me order of _four_ magnitude error, as opposed to order of -3
magnitude error when I use six decimal digits precision.

This is a very well known problem in existing storage tools/stacks
dealing with (powerful SCSI) LUs who implement queuing and or RAID.

This should be dynamically computed.  Maybe you should
take a look at the original code I submitted.  I'm sure
Bottomley has it.
They are not "free scbs", and the comment leaves
much to be desired.

Why 2?  Why not 3?  If you can set this to 3, then why not 4?
But if you can set it to 4, why not 5?
This value should also be dynamically set, it should depend on
the type of LU and it shouldn't be present in the host template.
(But that's an architectural argument which leads nowhere on lsml.)
Good luck!
