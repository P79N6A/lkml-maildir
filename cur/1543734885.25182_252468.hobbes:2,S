it is a very simple no-parameters call to a function that reads a
likely-cached word and returns. The cost is in the 2-3 cycles range - a
_single_ cachemiss can be 10-100 times more expensive, and cachemisses
happen very frequently in every iteration of the VM _scanning_ path
since it (naturally and inevitably) deals with lots of sparsely
scattered data structures that havent been referenced for quite some
time.
The function (cond_resched()) triggers scheduling only very rarely, you
should not be worried about that aspect either.

i'm not arguing that now at all, that preemption model clearly has to be
an optional thing - at least initially.
