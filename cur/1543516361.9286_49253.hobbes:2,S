i'm not sure threads can share an RT signal queue.  wouldn't that be
required in order to dispatch work from RT signals amongst several
threads?

while LIFO preserves CPU cache contents, it can be grossly unfair under
load, as you pointed out later.  but that may even be moot if sigwaitinfo
can deliver a vector of events at once, instead of just a single event.
