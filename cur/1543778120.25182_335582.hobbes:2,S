If the user doesn't notice the difference then there's no problem for 
him.
If there's a problem the user notices, then the process is to send an 
email to linux-kernel and/or open a bug in the kernel Bugzilla and 
follow the "please send the output of foo" and "please test patch bar" 
instructions.
What comes nearest to what you are talking about is that you run LTP 
and/or various benchmarks against every -git and every -mm kernel and 
report regressions. But this is sinply a task someone could do (and I 
don't know how much of it is already done e.g. at OSDL), and not 
something every user could contribute to.
