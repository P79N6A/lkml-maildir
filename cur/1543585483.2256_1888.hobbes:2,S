Alan, this is a fake argument.
Linux is bad, and you defend it by saying that it is impossible to be perfect.
I have used various Unix flavours for approximately thirty years.
Stack overflow has not been a real problem. Of course they occurred
every now and then, but roughly speaking only for unchecked recursion,
that is, in cases of a program bug.
Presently however, a flawless program can be killed.
That is what makes Linux unreliable.

Alan, this is a fake argument.
When I have a computer algebra system, and it computes millions of
function values for some expensive function, then it keeps a cache
of already computed values. Maybe a value is needed again and we
save ten seconds of computation.
But of course, when we run out of memory, nothing is easier than
just throwing this cache out.
You see, the bug is that malloc does not fail. This means that the
decisions about what to do are not taken by the program that knows
what it is doing, but by the kernel.
