Subject: [PATCH 0/7] rename locking functions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/17/189

Consider the naming of these functions :
 sema_init()
 init_MUTEX()
 init_MUTEX_LOCKED()
 init_rwsem()
They are not named very consistent, the naming is confusing and ugly with 
the mix of case and some are named init_* and some *_init.
I propose to clean that up by renaming the functions so they end up as :
 init_sema()
 init_mutex()
 init_mutex_locked()
 init_rwsem()
Since these are very widely used functions a transition period is needed, so 
the patches I'm posting create wrapper functions with the old names for
people to use until they get their code updated.
The patches also change all in-kernel code calling these functions to use the
new names.
I'm only able to test on i386, so please look carefully at these changes. I'm 
currently running a kernel with the patches applied and everything seems fine.
