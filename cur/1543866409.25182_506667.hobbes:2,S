I'm trying to convince myself none of your patch is necessary.  Probably
shall fail.  But how come we've survived for years with such an issue?

Depressed by profusion of PageUptodate_UpperAndlowercasevariants.
Those rmbs, you really only want them when it says "yes", don't you?

Plea noted.  I'm pondering.  "Eventually" indeed.  OTOH I expect you're
right to criticize anon/swap PageUptodate being set where it was needed
to get by, rather than where it was natural to do so.

Fix threaded user page write memory ordering
Make sure we order the writes to a newly created page
with the page table update that potentially exposes the
page to another CPU.
This is a no-op on any architecture where getting the
page table spinlock will already do the ordering (notably
x86), but other architectures can care.
