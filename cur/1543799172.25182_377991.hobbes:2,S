Oh if it is so we are in _violent_ agreement then.  I don't dispute that 
at all and I pretty agree with a separate namespace for mutexes.  
Actually I think no one contested that either.
Current semaphores can be migrated to mutexes individually when that 
makes sense to do so, separately.
With regards to my _implementation_ concerns about the proposed mutex 
patches I guess I can discuss them with Ingo (and an actual patch is 
coming to fix them).
