Yes.
That's why we should tell them what the channel is. :-)

Yes, but that may be done after the fact.  It's not a big problem to review an
email thread starting from a bug report and see if it lead to a fix (I do that
on a regular basis).  [Note: They tend to be relatively short. ]  You can even
check if the fix has been merged.
Still, you need to know which threads to review.
