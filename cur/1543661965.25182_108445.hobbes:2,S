Well the most important by far is to minimise seeks - you may
be able to achieve that by submitting big commands, but you can
also do it by accounting by time (not number of requests) and
anticipating reads. I'm not saying your way doesn't work.

Not sure exactly what you mean here, however no big starvation
occurs with the scheduler you will find in 2.5.59-mm10 +
experimental.
A streaming reader and streaming writer total 14MB/s in agregate
throughput, with 2.23 bytes read per write with default settings.
This goes to 11.4MB/s and a ratio of 1.6 with 0 readahead.
When I turn off anticipatory scheduling however, I get a good
17MB/s throughput with a ratio of 0.00 reads per write (actually
some small positive epsilon less than  one over one hundred).

The disk can't but the io scheduler obviously can. We can give
the disk a lot of help.
