I looked at nfsd/debug.h, and saw the NFSD_DEBUG usage, and thought "Wow, if I
built it without RPC_DEBUG, I'm screwed". I didn't see where RPC_DEBUG was
enabled if CONFIG_SYSCTL was defined - having "compile in debugging code"
equated to "system has sysctl support" was as unexpected as the guy today who
didn't realize you needed SCSI support for an IDE CD/ROM. ;)
"You are trapped in a twisty maze of little #ifdef's, all different"... ;)
