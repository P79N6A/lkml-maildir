Sorry, that I step in but you said that you are working on smartsuite (2.1+), 
again?
Andre, can you fix start/stop counts, please?

BTW
I had a double disk crash (same symptoms as in this thread) in a school's 
RAID5 with four Fujitsu MPG3204AT-EF (the ones with gel-lager, silent and 
reliable we hoped) last week...
The shop for which I work from time to time got 71 disks of this type back 
(sold over the last 1.5 years). We switched to them after the "IBM" disaster. 
Maybe a "misdecision" ;-)
What shall we sell safely, now...?
MAXTOR?
