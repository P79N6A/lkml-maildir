Right. So "so I'm left with either no wifi or no ethenet" being wrong.

Ok, I see.

With your patch you can still artificially create situations that
something doesn't work.
My point being: It works just fine without the patch.
And as I'm not really sure about the implications of the patch, I
won't ack this. But it seems Larry acked it. So that's also fine, if
he takes over responsibility for that change then. So the next
"You broke my kernel!!11" round can go to his mail address and I won't
be bothered by this anymore. ;)
