The averages might be nice...
	Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 0
But the maximum would allow any polling app to do its polling less often.
As well as the averages above...
	Average resident set size (kbytes): 0

	Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 21

How can you have voluntary context switches in a preemptive environment?
	Involuntary context switches: 0
	Swaps: 0
Counting swaps would be nice too.

One more thing:
$ cat /proc/meminfo 
MemTotal:       320628 kB
MemFree:          5148 kB
Buffers:          8316 kB
Where'd shared go, and why didn't rmap start populating this value?  It
should be there in the pte-chain lists...

HighTotal:           0 kB
HighFree:            0 kB
Why is high(total|free) there in a non-highmem kernel?  If this file were
more dynamic, then we wouldn't have apps that counted on the line number
instead of the first colum's value...
Ok, so that was two more... ;)
