What's happening is that some kernel developers don't like Linus's
stance on binary-only drivers and are trying to circumvent the norms
of software copyright law using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.  (Why some people
think that the GPL is magically exempt from Lotus v. Borland, Lexmark
v. Static Control, and their analogues in other jurisdiction is beyond
me -- but then I gave up smoking the FSF's parallel-legal-universe
herb some time ago.)
Just s/EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL/EXPORT_SYMBOL/ throughout the kernel and
you'll be fine -- at a technical level.  But be prepared, when later
changes break extra-volatile quasi-private in-kernel APIs, to keep
both pieces -- and to be shunned by EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL partisans.
Cheers (IANAL, TINLA),
