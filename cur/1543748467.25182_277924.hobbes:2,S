Ok. Then we would need rss and rss_anon on two additional cache lines?
Both rss and anon_rss on one line? mmap_sem and the page_table_lock also
each on different cache lines?

The advantage in the split rss solution is that it can be placed on the
same cacheline as other stuff from task that is already needed. So there
is minimal overhead involved. But I can certainly give it a spin and see
what the results are.
