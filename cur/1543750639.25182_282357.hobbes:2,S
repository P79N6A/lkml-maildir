That means that the cause of the IRQ that hung your machine was not one
we had any driver for. Thats generally BIOS bogosities on a large scale.
The irqpoll code can recover from cases where an IRQ turns up on the
wrong IRQ line but for a registered driver and when an IRQ fails to turn
up in which case the timer tick picks it up on x86 (which may or may not
make it "useful").

That wouldn't really fit how the hardware works. You appear to have some
unsupported device connected to that line and asserting IRQ right from
boot.
