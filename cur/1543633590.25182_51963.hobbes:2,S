That means the possible policy of
#include <stdio.h>
#include <linux/version.h>
void exit(int code);
int main(void) {
    if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,4,0)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Your kernel is too old!\n");
        exit(-127);
    }
    printf("Kernel version OK.\n");
    exit(0);
}
is impossible now after all, which is good, I think, because who said that 
the headers have to come from the _real_ _configured_ kernel? (It was way 
too crappy.)
Regards,
Thunder
