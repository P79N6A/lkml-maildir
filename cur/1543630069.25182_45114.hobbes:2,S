Hi,
Just rebooted to 2.5.15 to find 'depmod -a' report I/O errors
on one of the files in the module tree.
Back in 2.4, trying to access the file (on my reiserfs root) reports:
May 10 12:56:26 nibbler kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
May 10 12:56:26 nibbler kernel: 03:03: rw=0, want=807359916, limit=8185117
Everything else looks intact.
Running reiserfsck on the fs exits on an assertion error. Looks like I'll
have to re-mkfs the whole thing -- getting rid of the corrupt file seems
impossible.
The setup is:
K7/1GHz
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686b (rev 40) IDE UDMA100 controller on pci00:07.1
hda: 156301488 sectors (80026 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=9729/255/63, UDMA(100)
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 9729/255/63, sectors = 156301488, start = 0
 DMA modes: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 *udma5
I haven't observed similar problems in any of 2.5.14, 2.5.14-dj[12].
