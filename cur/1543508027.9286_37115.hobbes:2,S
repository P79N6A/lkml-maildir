I just got serveral Oopsen on my firewall last night.  I plugged a monitor
and keyboard in and took some photos of the screen and tried hitting
sysrq.  Unfortunately the batteries in my camera have gone flat so I can't
look at the images.  I did write down the EIP of one of the oopsen.
It was c01837a2.
System.map:
c01835f8 T do_tty_hangup
c0183870 T tty_hangup
SysRq S, U and T all Oopsed.  P and M worked and B locked the machine
completely so that no further SysRqs worked.
The kernel is the same one (in fact I haven't rebooted since) as mentioned
in my last Oops report (2.2.11 Oops in ipfw_output_check.) - that is,
2.2.11 with the following patches applied:
1. the autofs unfix that was in 2.2.12pre kernels;
2. cipe-1.3.0;
3. a patch for avoiding nmap scans (been on l-k a couple of times); and
4. the tcp fixes from 2.2.11 release notes.
Uptime was about 8 days.  Unless someone has said it won't be useful by
then, I'll post a lot more info when I've got some more batteries.
