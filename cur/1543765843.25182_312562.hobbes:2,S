 The original code also uses timer pending status as a signal that
command completed normally in scsi_eh_done() function, and the same
race also exists in the original code, no matter what we do, unless we
make timer expiration and removal of the command atomic, there will be
a window in which command completes normally but considered to have
timed out as long as we use timer pending status as tie breaker.
 The patch moves the test out of scsi_eh_done() into
scsi_send_eh_cmnd() and this does widen the window by delaying removal
of timer until after the original thread gets scheduled, but usually
not by much and that's how timers are done in many cases (through out
the kernel, timer removals are done with intervening scheduling and no
one considers those incorrect).  So...
 * If you're worried about the race itself, it was there before,
   it shouldn't cause any problem, and we really can't help it.
 * If you're worried about the widening of the window, practically,
   it wouldn't cause problem, and it's how timers are done in many
   other places.
 But if you still don't like it, I can rework it (maybe I'll need to
add a field to Scsi_Host or scsi_cmnd).  So, please let me know.
 Thanks a lot.
