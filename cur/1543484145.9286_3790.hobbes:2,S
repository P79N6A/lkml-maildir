I can't see any redhat sites in the DNS.  Other DNS queries return
much faster than those to redhat.
Even adding a dot to the end of the name to stop the DNS search from
trickling down the usable domains does not seem to speed things up.
Queries to non-existant hosts (www.somedumbhost.com) come return in a
timely manner.  This may be a problem with Redhat's ISP
