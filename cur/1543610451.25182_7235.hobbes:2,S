    Hello all :))
    Is there any problem on moving the /.journal file (even renaming
it) so it doesn't lives on the root? I mean, maintaining its inode
number, of course ;))
    Anyway, ext3 shouldn't (just an idea) show the journal as a
normal file. It may add some load on the kernel, because the inode
number should be compared with that of the journal every time a file
is accessed, but it's just a suggestion ;))
    And, BTW, ext3 works *really* great :))))
