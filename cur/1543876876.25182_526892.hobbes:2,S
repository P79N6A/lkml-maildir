Subject: [patch 1/6] Re-enable VDSO by default with PARAVIRT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/3/382

Everyone wants VDSO to be enabled by default.  COMPAT_VDSO still needs
a fix, but with luck that will turn up soon.
