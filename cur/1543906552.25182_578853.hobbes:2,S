Yeah on SUSE on SUSE. The _user_ may very well swap these, either by using
/usr/sbin/ifrename (which is not even from udev!), or doing the magic himself
(ioctls, netlink, whatever is needed).
Also, it may happen that further things pop up during the two renames, e.g.
	eth0 renamed to ethxx0
	ethxx0: link up
	ethxx0 renamed to foo0
If only udev were to print it:
	eth0: RealTek 8139 whatever
	ethxx0: ink up
	eth0 renamed to foo0
and you think "what's ethxx0?".
