Some of the shortcut files are symlinks. Of course
this is disgusting, since bash shouldn't have to be
aware of the underlying filesystem type. One would
have to add disgusting hacks to many programs,
including: ln tar mc cpio

...like vfat itself. You might as well argue for ripping
that out and using a userspace solution like mtools.

Symlinks are implemented, poorly, as .lnk files.
I don't care if you wish it weren't so. Microsoft
doesn't care either.

It's also unusable from common UNIX tools.

I'm very serious. The ability to install without partitioning
is important for hesitant new users.
Why not? The system might feel "unclean" to you, but it's
great for converting the Windows users. Not many people
are willing to trash their one-and-only partition, full of
data, to experiment with a new OS. Regular users don't
keep backups. Linux is the only UNIX-like OS that could
do a respectable job of running multi-user on vfat.
