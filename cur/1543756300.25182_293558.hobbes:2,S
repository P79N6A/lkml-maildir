It's just like DAC then, because it never applies any policy than a
simple check relying on kernel's DAC, and standard capabilities &
permissions.DAC-related checks are placed all over the place, but maybe
the place is lacking of some ones that may be important.
About what things it can break, I haven't noticed any issue on it (at
least regarding grSecurity or OpenWall), but of course I would
appreciate a lot any information on them, so, I could report to the
developers that are currently using this in their own solutions.
Thanks in advance,
Cheers.
