that's just not always possible. Think USB, where you don't know the hub
is there.. until it had time to think about it for a bit after it got
power.

well there is one worse behavior: doing it sync for some, async for
others. That'd mean that the kernel needs to do all the work AND
userspace needs to do all the work *again*.
Lets at least pick ONE place where the work needs to be done ;)
(and if that is userspace, we can make a debug config option which
delays device announcing for a second or two just to help userland
developers debug their code)
