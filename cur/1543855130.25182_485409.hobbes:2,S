I like this interface, although current one does not allow special
synchronization in userspace, since it calculates if new commit is in
the area where previous commit was.
Will change for the next release.

It _IS_ how previous interface worked.
	EXACTLY!
There was one syscall which committed requested number of events and
waited when there are new ready events. The only thing it missed, was
userspace index (it assumed that if userspace waits for something, then
all previous work is done).
Ulrich, I'm not going to think for other people all over the world and
blindly implementing ideas, which in a day or two will be commented as
redundant, since flow of mind has changed, and they had not enough time
to check previous version.
I will wait for some time until you and other people made theirs comments 
on interfaces and release final version in about a week, and now I will
go to hack netchannels.
	NO INTERFACE CHANGES AFTER THAT DAY. 
		COMPLETELY.
So, feel free to think about perfect interface anyone will be happy
with. But please release your thoughts not in form of abstract words,
but more precisely, at least like in this e-mail, so I could understand
what _you_ want from _your_ interface.
