Looking back at it, I think the current TCP code is right, once you look 
at the "event" to be a output buffer full->with_space transition.
If you drop an fd inside epoll with EPOLLOUT|EPOLLET and you get an event 
(free space on the output buffer), if you do not consume it (say a 
tcp_sendmsg that re-fill the buffer), you can't see other OUT event 
anymore since they happen on the full->with_space transition.
Yes, I know, the read size (EPOLLIN) works differently and you get an 
event for every packet you receive. And yes, I do not like asymmetric 
things. But that does not make the EPOLLOUT|EPOLLET wrong IMO.
