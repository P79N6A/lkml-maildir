I don't know how widespread the practice is, but in the AFS Admin Guide under
"Configuring Your AFS Filespace" / "The Second (Cellname) Level" it suggests
creating symlinks in /afs to provide aliases for cells. For instance, in my
test cell, I've got:
[root@host135 root]# ls -l /afs
total 0
lrwxr-xr-x    1 4077     root           20 Feb  7  2002 cambridge -> cambridge.redhat.com
drw-r--r--    1 4077     root           11 Feb  7  2002 cambridge.redhat.com
drw-r--r--    1 4077     root           29 Mar 27  2002 grand.central.org
Unfortunately, the above command causes cambridge.redhat.com to be mounted
with the follow_link() on directory method you suggested (which is
undesirable):-/
