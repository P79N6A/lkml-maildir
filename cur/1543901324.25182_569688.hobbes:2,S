Damn, you had to pick the week I've only got my 32-bit laptop
connected to open the merge window :-), I thought it might have hit an
-mm but there doesn't seem to be any during the merge window...
I'll get some cross compilers down and try and squeeze them onto it..
drop it and I'll fix it up and resend...
