Yes.  This needs to be true even for mixed file types.  If the bottom
FS has a directory `foo/' and the top FS has a regular file `foo' and a
user does chdir("foo") he gets -ENOTDIR.

Notice the implication here: the act of mounting a FS "-o rw,trans"
makes all other FSes in the stack RO (at least effectively).  This
being the case, I think it makes tons of sense to restrict "-o trans"
to only *one* RW in the stack.  This restriction helps avoid all manner
of weird semantics questions and races.

Hmmm, I am leaning only allowing the top FS to be RW.  It would IMHO be
easier to implement.  You do have a point in that mounting something RO 
over a RW FS adds flexibility.

That's why I said all other RW mounts are effectively RO.

Yeah.

Can o' worms.  A better way to get this functionality is with loopback
mounting à la AIX and others.

I vote for 7.  RW means COW.

Another can o' worms.  I'd avoid this one too.  A file on a RO media
can be changed on the RW one (COW) but not deleted / renamed.

Yeah, far-in-the-future.
