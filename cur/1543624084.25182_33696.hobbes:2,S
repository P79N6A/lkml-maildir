Since the only person that comes to mind that would be crazy enough to
even _try_ to use Linux on 386-SMP is you, Alan, I'm really relieved to
hear you say that ;)
And no, it's not worth discontinuing i386 support.  It just isn't
painful enough to maintain. 
Note that the i386 has _long_ been a "stepchild", though: because of the
lack of WP, the kernel simply doesn't do threaded MM correctly on a 386. 
Never has, and never will. 
However, the known "incorrect" case is so obscure that it's not even an
issue - although I suspect that it means that you should not let
untrusted users run on a i386 server machine that contains any sensitive
data.  I could cerrtainly come up with exploits that would work at least
in theory (whether they are workable in practice I don't know). 
Using i386's for network servers is fine, of course.  Just don't use
them for cpu farms (not that I think anybody is - it takes quite a big
farm of i386 machines to equal even _one_ PII ;)
