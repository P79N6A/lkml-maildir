   You can. Acard for instance makes devices for that. They plug at 
the end of an ide cdrom or harddisk, and interface with scsi. They 
have two models, a 20MB/s one, and an UltraWide model that goes 
up to 40MB/s. It has a small risc cpu and you can even upgrade their 
firmware. A friend of mine ordered one to plug a dvd reader in an 
external scsi box he had lying around - he had all his computer drive 
bays used. He said it worked fine and didn't notice any performance 
hit even when playing dvd's.
