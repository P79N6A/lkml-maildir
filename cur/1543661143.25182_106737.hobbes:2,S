There's a classic Monty Python skit where John Cleese is organizing an
expedition to build a bridge between the two peaks of Mt Kilamanjaro.
I have to do most of my kernel hacking at home, on my own time.  So I'm
sitting there with a laptop and no second machine.  Now, if the intent is
to say "Don't bother doing anything that might require debugging unless you
can afford 2 machines", that's OK - but let's be open about that requirement.
And has been pointed out, some laptops don't even *HAVE* a serial port.
There's a *REASON* that IBM RS/6K boxes have at least a little 3-digit LED
display - during boot or a panic, even if you can't trust the console drivers
anymore, you can still output *something*.
