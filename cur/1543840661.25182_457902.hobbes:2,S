Their data sheet doesn't explain it too well, but it looks like they
use a similar implementation to the MSP430 UARTs, which are designed
to work with very low clock rates.  (32768 Hz watch crystals are
popular.)
Just as a reminder, UART receive operation is generally:
- After detecting a falling edge, wait half a bit time.
- Sample the input 3x and majority-vote.  If the input
  line is still low, call this a start bit and prepare to
  receive a character.
- Wait one bit time, sample 3x, and call the majority the start bit.
- Repeat for all data bits and the stop bit.  If the stop bit isn't
  1 as expected, note a framing error.
This is traditionally done by running a 16x clock sampling the
input, and after detecting a start bit on one clock (call that
clock 0), sample the start bit on clocks 7, 8 and 9, the first bit
on clocks 23, 24 and 25, etc.
MSP430 UARTs have a fully programmable clocks/bit number (no fixed /16,
although you want a few clocks per bit so the standard "sample 3x and
majority vote" algorithm works), and can add +1 clock to individual
bit times to approximate a desired baud rate more closely by dithering.
Oh, and they use both edges of the clock.
So it can go to a baud rate 1/3 of the input baud clock (sample the
start bit at 1, 1.5 and 2 clocks, then the first bit at 4, 4.5 and 5,
etc.), and proceed to 9/24, 10/24, etc.
