We've considered enabling compound pages permanently.  We thought sparc64
might want that, and it simplifies coverage testing.  But the
conditionality has been left in for now as a microoptimisation.

Why _does_ !CONFIG_MMU futz around with page counts in such weird ways
anyway?  Why does it have requirements for higher-order pages which differ
from !CONFIG_MMU?
If someone could explain the reasoning behind the current code, and the FRV
enhancements then perhaps we could work something out.

I don't expect they have significant performance overhead, because they'll
only add cycles for higher-order pages.  They're rare, and are already
rather inefficient.
