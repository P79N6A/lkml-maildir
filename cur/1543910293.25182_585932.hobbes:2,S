That means you also have to power it on...

I do not see why that would be needed from a software point of view. Just make
sure that the disk does not needlessy emergency-park when pulling power. When
someone wants to write to disk, the request goes to the device driver, which
hands it to the controller, which hands it to the disk. And your controller
should be able to handle it (e.g. wait until reconnect) when there is a request
for a disk that is powered off.
