This is one of the things that user-mode Linux (
http://user-mode-linux.sourcefo
rge.net) is for.  I've been shipping kernels with devfs since devfs made it 
into the mainline pool.
With UML, you can boot up a virtual machine, and play with devfs all you want 
without any chance of messing up the host.
