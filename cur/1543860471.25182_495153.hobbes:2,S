It can be an issue with virtual caches if the "I/O" is done
using cpu loads and stores, but we should be handling that
with explicit flushing anyways.
The core of the problem is that ARM doesn't look for the user
mappings for anonymous pages when flush_dcache_page() is invoked.
I think as a temporary fix it could walk the RMAP list and
use that to find the user virtual mappings.  Would that work
Russel?
