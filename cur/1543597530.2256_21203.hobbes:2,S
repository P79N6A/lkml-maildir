Exactly.  I don't think of it as an API in the true meaning of the
term.  No one other than that specific driver should (can?) even use it.

Exactly.  I know myself and Keith Whitwell in particular have put a lot
of effort into making the open source drivers at least in the same
ballpark of performance as their Win32 counterparts.  People will never
seriously use Linux for 3D if performance just plain sucks.  Now, at
least they have the option of buying an NVIDIA card...
