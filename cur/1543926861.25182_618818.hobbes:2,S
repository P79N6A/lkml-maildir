I realley doubt that will fix it.
My stacktrace was like:
run_workqueue
called: rpc_async_schedule
  that called: rpc_release_calldata
    which points to: nfs_async_unlink_release
       that called: nfs_free_unlinkdata
So it does not matter for me if nfs_sb_deactive is called one step earlier.
Currently building with SLAB instead SLUB to see if lockdep tells something...
