Hello all,
From time to time I run an old DOS game under dosemu under X.  In 2.5.64,
everything works fine.  In 2.5.65, after about a minute, the display locks
up.  Alt-Sysrq stills works OK.  Before I start a binary search on the -bk
snapshots between 2.5.64 and 2.5.65, does anyone have a suggestion for the
culprit or a better debugging method?
Thanks, Wayne
