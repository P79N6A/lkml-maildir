Hello, I'm running unmodified 2.4.5 on a Red Hat 7.1 system and have an
IBM DiskOnKey (a USB not-so-mass storage device).  When mounting the
device, the SCSI layer responds with the error:
SCSI error: host 1 id 0 lun 0 return code = 8000002
        Sense class 7, sense error 0, extended sense 0
The device seems to work fine, and I have experienced no data corruption
or other problems.  I was wondering what the cause of this error was and
if it should be taken as a warning of potential data loss.
Thanks, Ryan Mack
