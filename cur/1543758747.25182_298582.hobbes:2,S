That's a style issue.  Propose an API, I'll code it.   We can have
the master recovery thread be a state machine, and so every device
driver gets notified of state changes:
typedef enum pci_bus_state {
     DEVICE_IO_FROZEN=1,
     DEVICE_IO_THAWED,
     DEVICE_PERM_FAILURE,
};
struct pci_driver {
   .... 
   void (*io_state_change) (struct pci_dev *dev, pci_bus_state);
};
would that work?
