Hi. Since I upgraded to 2.6.12, i get messages like
codec_semaphore: semaphore is not ready [0x1][0x
301300]
codec_write 1: semaphoreis not ready for register 0x54
_randomly_ (meaning that in some boots it shows up, but in others doesn't) in 
some init scripts (for example, alsa).
It's an HP pavilion zv5000 (amd64 laptop). Please tell me which more info may 
I supply to trace this. But I repeat, it's not _always_ reproducible.
Regards,
Rafael Rodríguez
