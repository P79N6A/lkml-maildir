Hi all,
I am looking for Michael Flynn original paper about computer
organization in which Flynn devised the so-called "Flynn Taxonomy". I
tried Google, IEEE Xplore, ACM, Yahoo but in vain. I would be very
grateful if someone can post a scanned version of the manuscript.
Here is the citation as generated by the paper BibTeX entry in Google scholar:
Michael J. Flynn. Some Computer Organizations and Their Effectiveness. IEEE
Transactions on Computers, 21(9):948{960, 1972.

Many thanks in advance.
Best regards,
