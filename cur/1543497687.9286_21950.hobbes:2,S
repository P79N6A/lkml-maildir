I finally gave up on trying to wedge a kernel, libc4, an installer, a shell,
gpm, and a wad of pcmcia goop (for bootstrapping Linux onto my VAIO 505fx)
onto a regular uncompressed 1.44 floppy today, and reworked my initrd'ed
installer to use a two-step floppy:  600kb of uncompressed floppy to hold
a kernel and all the lilo infrastructure needed to load the initrd, then
840kb to wedge a compressed filesystem.
After 4 hours of loading a system onto a floppy, only to have it load the
600k bootfs instead of the gz'ed rootfs at 600kb, I gave up and looked at
the (2.0.28+logo) source and discovered, to my intense dismay, that no
matter how hard I tried to set ramdisk_start to 600, an initrd'ed file
system would load at offset 0.   So I fixed it.  And then I looked at
2.2.7, and the same feature is there.
So, here's a one line patch to enable RAMDISK_START=XXX for initrd'ed
floppy images.   Am I missing something really trivial, or is this a
good candidate for wedging into the mainline kernels (patch against
2.2.9):
