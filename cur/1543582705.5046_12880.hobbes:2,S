Hi there,
running "top" on a 2.2.18 Kernel showed me the ammount of memory shared.
Now under 2.4.x "top" always displays "0" and i have mountet the tmpfs (if it's needed for that ?).
Is shared memory gone? Is my "top" to old?! I think i've installed all needed versions
as described in "Changes" under linux/Documentation
I don't think there isn't any shared memory, but i'm confused :)
Thanx a lot,
  Thomas
