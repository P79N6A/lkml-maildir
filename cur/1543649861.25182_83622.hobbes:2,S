Subject: [PATCH] NMI request/release, version 8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/25/85

I realized that the piece of code at the end of the old NMI handler was 
still necessary.  I have attached a patch to the previous version to fix 
the problem.  The full version of the patch with this fix is on my web 
page at 
http://home.attbi.com/~minyard/linux-nmi-v8.diff.
