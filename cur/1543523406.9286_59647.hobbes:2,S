Do I smell a deadlock here? :)
HINT: deadlocks of this kind have been observed in 2.2.13
and 2.2.14. GFP_KERNEL allocations had eaten into the last
free pages (below freepages.min) and seriously confused
some algorithms that depend on the emergency pages.

Indeed. If you cannot rely on PF_MEMALLOC any more, you're
bust.

Of course it can. Now think about likelyhood...

Indeed, the real solution is to fix the buggy code.

I'm now running my system (and NL.linux.org) with a
temporary kludge. I only allow __GFP_MED allocations
to eat into the first half of freepages.min.
I hope this will (for now) avoid the worst crashes
from both sides. Again, this is not the solution. We
should search for the buggy code and try to fix as
much as possible before 2.2.15...

Rik
