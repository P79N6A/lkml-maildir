Erm, a small patch is something which should _obviously_ fix one
issue. A small patch, containing at max some 100 lines, can easily be
read and understood.
A complete filesystem (I'm co-maintaining one for an ancient on-disk
format, too) isn't really easy to understand or to verify from looking
at it for 5min.

I give a shit of nothing to some 5 year work if I cannot verify that
it won't hurt me at some point.

Just put reiser4 in some GIT tree and publish it. Maybe you can place
it on git.kernel.org .
