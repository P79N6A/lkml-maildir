It's something that C isn't particularly good at. C++ is better at this as you
can define a class and overload the -> operator and the unary * operator if
you're feeling particularly evil or adventurous. But C it is...

Maybe there should be some naming convention for quasi-pointers like this? I
could typedef it, for instance, and hang comments appropriate to its nature of
the typedef. Perhaps:
	typedef struct __key_ref_with_possession_attribute *key_ref;
And then give its accessor functions capital letters to make them stand out,
though that might give the false impression that they're actually preprocessor
macros.
Or perhaps I should rename two of the functions:
	key_mkref() -> construct_key_ref()
	key_deref() -> convert_key_ref_to_ptr() or extract_key_ptr()
Would that serve in lieu of commenting every time I use these things?
