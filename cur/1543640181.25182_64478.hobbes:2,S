linear = c*H*S + h*S + (s-1)
byte offset? It is sector offset... byte_ofs = sect_ofs*512

Most likely you forgot to *512

I'd say dig out good old DOS diskedit from Norton utils.
If you insist on hand editing, please note that CHS addresses
in MBR and extended partitions are bogus for new large drives -
use "Starting sector" and "# of sectors" instead.
There is subtle rule: starting sector is disk relative in MBR
but extd_partition_start relative in extd partition
Even more subtle: 
MBR -> part1                         <- disk relative
    -> extd1                         <- disk relative
                 -> part2            <- extd1 relative
                 -> extd2            <- extd1 relative
                          -> part3   <-extd1 relative (yes! _extd1_!)
Yes it's brain damaged.
Good luck. :-)
