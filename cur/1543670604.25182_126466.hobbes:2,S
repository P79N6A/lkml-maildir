The copy_{to,from}_user functions can access either user or kernel space.
after set_fs(KERNEL_DS), they access kernel space, after 
set_fs(USER_DS), they access user space.
The initial boot thread starts with set_fs(KERNEL_DS), and is switched 
back to set_fs(USER_DS) in search_binary_handler (fs/exec.c), called 
during exec of /sbin/init.

P.S.: On i386, you can access both kernel and user space after 
set_fs(KERNEL_DS), or if you use __get_user() and bypass access_ok(). 
Thus the __get_user() in arch/i386/kernel/traps.c, function 
show_registers is correct. This is the only instance I'm aware of where 
this is used, and noone else should be doing that. It fails on other 
archs, e.g. on sparc.
