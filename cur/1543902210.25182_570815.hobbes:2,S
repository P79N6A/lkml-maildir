In my case it results in a completely tits-up machine.  CPU stuck somewhere
spinning with local interrutps disabled.
If you see the log output I sent, I'm suspecting this might be because
this BSG brainfart has exposed underlying bugs in IDE or SCSI.
Note that I saw literally 20,000 lines of output in the bit which I snipped,
so something has gone pretty wild in the handling of these bogus commands.
