Bus and/or driver.  However even though the mechanisms and specifications 
are all different, that doesn't mean the user interfaces have to be 
different.  Using simple character string names (like Pat did and like I 
did several months ago) should be general enough to work everywhere.
Similarly, the sysfs files themselves should be uniform (even if their
contents aren't).  The core should provide the user interface mechanism
and infrastructure, while leaving it up to the bus and the device drivers
to interpret the meanings of the strings.

It's a good place to define and implement power states.  But the driver 
core PM infrastructure obviously should be defined and implemented in the 
core, not in the drivers.

Personally I don't care much one way or another.  The APIs can be kept 
separate or overlapped somehow; it doesn't really matter.  Just so long as 
it's done the same way in all drivers and in the core.

Can you think of device classes other than "net" requiring this special
approach?  Network interfaces already get special treatment in some ways
(for example, they don't have entries in /dev).  This could just be
another form of special treatment for them.
