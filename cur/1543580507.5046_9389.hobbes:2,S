TUX 2.0 is now available for download at the following URL:
    
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/tux/tux-2.0/
The TUX 2.0 release is an incremental upgrade to TUX 1.0 and keeps
source-code level compatibility with user-space modules.
A number of incremental enhancements have been made:
- True zero-copy disk reads: Whereas TUX 1.0 copied files into a temporary
  buffer, TUX 2.0 is integrated with the page cache and thus uses zero-copy
  block IO.
- Generic zero-copy network writes: TUX 2.0 uses the generic zero-copy TCP
  framework.
- Zero-copy parsing:  Where possible, TUX parses input packets directly.
  Even in RAM-limited situations, TUX now does full, back-to-back
  zero-copy I/O.
Other changes include:
- Enhanced user-space utilities and module support.
- Mass virtual hosting support. The host-based virtual server patch has
  been added to TUX. There is no limit on the number of virtual hosts
  supported, only RAM and diskspace.
- CGIs can be bound to particular CPUs or can be left unbound.
- A number of bugs were fixed which caused performance problems - TUX 2.0
  is now significantly faster than TUX 1.0!
