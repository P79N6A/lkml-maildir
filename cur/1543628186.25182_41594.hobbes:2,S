Unless your patch is reversed, that's what I've got (on the red hat systems, 
the linux from scratch systems use BSD style init scripts because I'm not 
THAT masochistic).  It doesn't help.
I've also wandered through arch/i386/kernel/apm.c enough to confirm that 
apm_power_off() does seem to be getting called.  And the hard drive does 
audibly spin down on the systems that have the case off, it just doesn't stop 
throwing out a video signal to the monitor, using the processor to heat the 
room, etc...
I might get some time to thump onn it more this weekend, but it's pretty far 
down on the to-do list...
