Incorrect.  It must, or the kernel code in question is by definition
buggy.

On some architectures, this is true.  But not all architectures, and
not in all circumstances.  For example, even on the x86 architecture,
in the 4G/4G mode, a user-mode pointer is *not* valid when kernel code
is running.  You must use copy_to_user()/copy_from_user().  Simply
dereferencing a user-mode pointer is a BUG.  It might work sometimes,
on some architectures, but not everywhere.  Therefore, for correctly
written kernel code, you must not do it.
