Ok, after I compiled the driver with special udma feature and special
fasttrak feature, I got decent transfer rates (40-50MB/s) from the
drive.
I let a process running which continously copied a big (700MB) file,
removed the old copy, umounted an mounted the filesystem, and checked
the md5sum of the file. I didn't see a single corruption in >160 copies. 
At the same time, a second process was generating load by compiling
kernels on a different partition on the same drive. One partition was
below the 137GB boundary, one was above it.

These tests were done with patched 2.4.21.
