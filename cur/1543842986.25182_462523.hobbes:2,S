If the boundary is at page 1024 then pages 0-1024 are direct mapped into
KVA, page 1024 is not mapped at all and part of HIGHMEM, when that zone
is freed up later those pages will be in the HIGHMEM zone and
allocatable.  Move the boundary down to 1000 then 24 pages of KVA will
no longer be used as direct maps, and pages from 1000 onwards are in
zone HIGHMEM, non direct mapped, but available to allocatable.  Cut a
section out of the middle of NORMAL and you just have to bin the pages
'behind' that KVA as you can persuade them to be part of HIGHMEM.  You
can't adjust the boundary to allow for it.
The key here is that moving the end of NORMAL downwards moves the
beginning of HIGHMEM downwards also pulling the pages into HIGHMEM
implicitly, that cannot be done anywhere but at the end of NORMAL.

Right, so the instant we detect it at the location grub specifies can we
not just move it somewhere else random like 20Mb up or something and
change the pointer, then carry on?

Not that I am aware of, as if a page is in NORMAL it is expected to be
direct mapped, you have stolen their mapping for KVA thus they have to
be junked.
