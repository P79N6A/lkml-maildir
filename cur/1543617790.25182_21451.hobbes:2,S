Hi!
I am having a box with 8GB RAM and 8 CPU's.
I just changed updated the kernel to 2.4.17 and it booted up fine.....but as
soon as it started warming up
and using some memory.....kswapd came in and locked the CPU and the box
overall. The load went
upto about 29. It locked up the box and the CPU usage was at 99%
After sometime it did finish and I regained control on my system, but then
after some time the same problem
Can any of you help??
Thanks in anticipation.
Regards,
Anish Srivastava
