Thanks.  I get the basic idea now: the namespace itself need not be
shared between the sessions, it is enough if "share" propagation is
set up between the different namespaces of a user.
I don't yet see either in your or Viro's description how the trees
under /share/$USER are initialized.  I guess they are recursively
bound from /, and are made slaves.
