I've never been able to reproduce it with libata+PATA patches, with
ide-scsi or with scsi devices. One clear reason for that is they handle
partial write returns correctly which unpatched drivers/ide does not.
So ide-cd goes  "Read 64K" and the CD goes "umm erp splat have 8K" and
it tells the block layer "failed". ide-scsi goes "here is 8K, fail 56K"
and also adjusts the volume size (without proper locking)
The underlying problem is the block layer certainly but ide-cd is an
offender too. One simple hack for ide-cd would be to return success and
fill the excess buffer space with "JensAxboeAteMyComputer"[1] or similar
as padding providing the write fail is coming from end of media in the
last 150K or so.
