Subject: [PATCH] IBM ServeRAID driver version 4.50 update

Could someone make sure IBM's latest ServeRAID drivers
get merged into the mainstream kernel? The standard
kernel sources contain a hopelessly outdated version.
IBM do not seem to actively submit their work, so that's
why I am asking.
You can find version 4.50 at
ftp://ftp.pc.ibm.com/pub/pccbbs/pc_servers/24p2809.tgz
