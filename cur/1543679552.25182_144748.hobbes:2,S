Wow, that's great, it works really well.  I'm doing a software raid-0
across the two sata drives, I've been stressing it all afternoon with
no problems.
To see the CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_* options during configuration I had to set
CONFIG_SCSI=y  (I had it set to CONFIG_SCSI=m previously.)  Also, if
you want to boot from the SATA drives you should also set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y, or maybe load the module from initrd.
I enjoy having the drives called /dev/sd[ab], it makes me feel like I
paid more money for them.
