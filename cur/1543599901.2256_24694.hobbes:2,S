Its a design property vmalloc never had. It isnt meant to be abused that
way

Lack of crystal balls.
The VM seemed ok until after 2.4.0 at which point it became clear it had
some rather large corner cases where it was not. Fixing them is an
iterative process and getting all cases right is hard. I'm very happy with
the 2.4.9-ac tree VM. It needs the inode cache handling resolved better
but it works
