Ah, this actually makes sense.  The setfcaps usage() statement does
	for (i=0; _cap_names[i]; i++) {
		printf...
so it expects _cap_names to end with a terminating NULL, but that
doesn't seem to be the case in cap_names.h in libcap.
KaiGai, perhaps setfcaps should do something like
diff setfcaps.c.orig setfcaps.c
25c25
<     for (i=0; _cap_names[i]; i++)
