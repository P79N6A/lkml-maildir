I've noticed some general dysfunction with Linux and attaching strace to
running processes. It seems that strace cannot attach without effecting
the state of the process it is attaching too - I never had time to trace
the particular problem down, but from this it sounds like a plausible
explanation [strace causes a slow system call to return?].
