That's not correct. In Windows this is neither handled by the kernel nor
by the file manager. In fact it is handled by a library function. If you
wanted to start a document from the command line, you should try 'start
mydocument.doc'.
In Windows there is a need for such a function, as the system does not
provide fork().
