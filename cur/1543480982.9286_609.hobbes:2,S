Hello; I have a quick Mozilla question - please respond to me directly
to not clutter the mailing list.
Is anyone using non-Motif Mozilla at all?  What is a stable version to
use (source too of course)?
I am dying to fix a couple of specific problems (Netscape's ridiculous
memory leak in particular) but until there is a version that doesn't
crash every 5 minutes this isn't reasonable for me.
Thanks,
Mark
