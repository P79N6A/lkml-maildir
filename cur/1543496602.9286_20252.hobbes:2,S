Hmm? You must be thinking of a different slow start than everybody else.
Linux increases the cwnd by one for every received ack that acks some data.
Adding some packet counting heuristics is first impossible (the data may
have been repacketized since then in the write queue), slow (it would add
lots of cycles for list walking in the fast ack path) and experimental
(afaik nobody else does it this way, because it makes no sense - this is not
a research OS)

It is of course ok to tune it to moderate values, Linux 2.2 didn't do it to 
stay on the conservative side.

Linux TCP tries to minimize acks for various reasons - perhaps you don't care
about low speed and congested links, but other people do.
Linux 2.2 has a few changes over 2.0 in this regard, e.g. it tries to match
its MSS estimate for the 2*MSS rule to the real world (this is mainly needed
for HIPPI where even bulk transfers can often be <MSS), it has a "quick ack
mode" to get the other end quickly out of slow start, and some other heuristics.
initial cwnd is still 1 per default, although it can be changed without 
problems.
