That I got, somewhere in trying to build a working kernel without the 
config_broken, i2c-isa got lost.  Restored that and all is well in 
that dept.
I've got 3 patches that remove the '&& EXPERIMENTAL' from the Kconfigs 
for the nforce2 stuffs, and even posted one here, but got .000zip 
response, so I don't know if they are welcome or not...
