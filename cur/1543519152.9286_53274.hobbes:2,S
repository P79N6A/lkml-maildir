Whenever I try and play ANY sound to the /dev/dsp1 (dsp is taken by my
sb16 asp), the computer locks tight.  I have removed the sysrq turn off
in the start up scripts in RedHat 6.1 (totally up to date machine), but
none of them work.
I would love to help debug this problem because myself and my father use
these cards and would love to enjoy them in Linux.  Is there any way,
without buying hardware debugging tools, that I can help?
System configuration (lspci, kernel config, etc.) available if needed.
