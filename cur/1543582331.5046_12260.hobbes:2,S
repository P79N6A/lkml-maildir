    Your drive is broken, the only other valid combination is 0x3a/0x02
    which means no media and tray open. You could try and dump the asc
    and ascq to see what your drive reports for the different states.
Ha Jens - must we disagree twice on one evening?
You know all about this stuff, so probably I am mistaken.
However, my copy of SFF8020-r2.6 everywhere has
"Sense 02 ASC 3A: Medium not present" without giving
subcodes to distinguish Tray Open from No Disc.
So, it seems to me that drives built to this spec will not have
nonzero ASCQ.
