Hello,
I haven't even seen the email yet from linux-kernel about the v2.6
release, but if Slashdot says it's so, it *must* be true. I have just
put the finishing touches on my document describing many of the changes
in the new kernel release. If you're interested, please check it out. It
should be pretty accurate.
Check it out:
