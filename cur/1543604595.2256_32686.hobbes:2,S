Subject: [PATCH] Updated cachesize errata
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
  The patch below fixes yet another CPU that reports incorrect cachesize.
This one is a little trickier than the previous fixes of this sort, as Intel
have made two CPUs with differing cachesizes, with the same model/stepping.
(Yes, we were meant to distinguish between with cachesize-- doh)
Buggy PIII Tualatins with 256K cache will automatically be fixed up with this patch.
Ones with 512K cache will need an extra boot time argument passed
'cachesize=512'
This bootflag may also come in useful if/when any future CPU makes this mistake
again. Now people can override what the CPU reports, without having to wait
for a kernel patch.
Patch applies to 2.4.13pre1, and 2.4.12-ac1 cleanly, and has been tested on
several boxes here without problems.
regards,
Dave.
