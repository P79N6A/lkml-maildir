I had the same problem after upgrading the BIOS on a Trigem Napoli-2
mainboard with a 440BX (eMachine 500a). Tested with kernels 2.4.5-RH
through 2.4.13-ac7. With Bios image v1.12 it hangs with agpgart built in
or on module load exactly as you described, it also fails when I use
nvidia's NVdriver agp support. After upgrading to Bios 1.13 the problem
went away.
Something to check for anyway...
For completeness, my working setup displays the normal kernel apggart
info and shows this:
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 440BX/ZX - 82443BX/ZX AGP bridge
(rev 03) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
        Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 64
        Bus: primary=00, secondary=01, subordinate=01, sec-latency=64
        I/O behind bridge: 0000d000-0000dfff
        Memory behind bridge: fc600000-fe6fffff
        Prefetchable memory behind bridge: f0400000-f44fffff
