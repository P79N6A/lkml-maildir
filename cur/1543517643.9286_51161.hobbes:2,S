I think I figured out what is happening with the scheduling latency
problem I reported earlier.
An interrupt can occur during the kernel schedule function
just prior to the "__switch_to" function and the interrupt handler
may add a new task to the run-queue and set current->need_resched.
Then the current task gets switched out immediately and the need_resched
flag is lost.  Should the new task inherit need_resched in this
case?  Is this an oversight or is this intentional?
