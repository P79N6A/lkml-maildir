You could consider loading your .o as an apache module, rather than
executing it as a CGI program.
I was involved in one project where we did this with good success. Even
segfaults in our module would "only" take down one of the Apache
sub-processes, so while they incur performance overhead (and of course
should be fixed no matter what - which luckily is very easy (using for
example { if (!fork()) abort(); } to create snapshot coredumps)), it's
not catastrophic.  It's entirely realistic to write a good module for
Apache in a fairly short timespan.
