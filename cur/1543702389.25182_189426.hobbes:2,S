Hi,
Does parport_pc have the capability to share IRQs?  I have a PCI
parallel card with two ports on it:
parport0: PC-style at 0x3bc (0x7bc), irq 7, dma 3 [PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP,DMA]
parport1: PC-style at 0xc400 (0xc800), irq 9, using FIFO [PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP]
parport1: irq 9 in use, resorting to polled operation
parport2: PC-style at 0xcc00 (0xd000) [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
parport0 is the mb's builtin parallel port, and parport1/parport2 are
the two ports on the PCI card.  IRQ 9 is taken by USB already.  But
since it's a modern PCI card, it would stand to reason that it should be
able to share the IRQ with another PCI device, no?  Unfortunately, my
application requires interrupt-driven operation.
