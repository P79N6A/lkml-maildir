Mirroring The Linux HQ Web Site
     The Linux v2 Information Headquarters Web Site SHOULD NOT be
mirrored. The reasons for
     this are very simple; The entire web site contains thousands of pages
that change on a daily basis,
     our bandwidth is very limited and most mirroring software tends to
monopolize the bandwidth, not
     allowing others to view the content. 
     Due to these limitations, The Linux HQ Web Site IS NOT to be
mirrored. My goal is to make this
     site as accessible as possible, while keeping the costs at a
reasonable rate. 
     Violations of this policy will not be tolerated!
