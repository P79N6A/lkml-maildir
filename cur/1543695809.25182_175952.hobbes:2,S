Seems fine.

Then just comment ou the #define.  Rule of the thumb:  #undef always means
you screwed up elsewhere :)

cli() disabled all intereupts in 2.4 which was safe, you only disable local
interrupts which is ok on UP but doesn't work on SMP.  The right fix would
be to introduce spinlocks.  But given the driver design this might be
everything but easy - that's why I think killing the driver in favour of tmcsim
might be the better idea.

A poper driver shouldn't do that, but we already know this one isn't..

Oh.  What driver did you find this construct in?
