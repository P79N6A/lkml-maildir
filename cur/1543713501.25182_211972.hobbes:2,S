Here is a main idea. I can put a lot of effort to
debug VM once. I (and others) are not destined to do
such kind of debugging (with C inside the kernel)
after that. It's like with JAVA VM - it's hard to
debug VM, but it should be done once - after that JAVA
program can't use a pointer to a nonallocated memory.
Those who continue to use C - should be careful with
pointersin each program.

Exactly. :-) i'm not claiming that I solve all
problems. But this technology helps to make
development of some kernel parts easier. Encapsulation
helps and you can easily debug LISP program in the
userspace before loading it into the kernel.
No matter what particular LISP program does - it can't
crash the kernel - C code can do that easily.
