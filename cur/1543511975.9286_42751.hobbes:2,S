They are files (weird ones) in the Unix tradition that devices are files.

The standard interface is that permissions stay put, even after reboots.

Fine example of the technical excellence and open-mindedness requested

If technical reasons are given for disliking the idea, it is "emotional
stupidity", and the idea is "better" just because you say so.
Reasons against devfs:
- Permanent attributes are kludged on
- Breaks filesystem semantics in several ways, makes it very hard to check
  ramifications
- Impacts system administration, making device managing a lot less Unixy
- Impacts _every_ single driver in the kernel, even if it isn't used
- What can be done with devfs can be done without it. Granted, it is less
  convenient. But I add/remove devices from my machines perhaps once a
  month, so that doesn't cut it for me.
Reasons for devfs:
- Makes handling hot-plug easier, but marginally so
- Unclutters /dev
Also: It is extra code, has to be maintained and updated, and has to be
accounted for in new driver developments. It _will_ add new bugs, even new
classes of bugs. This doesn't come for free.
Weighting the above, the answer for me is clearly "no".
