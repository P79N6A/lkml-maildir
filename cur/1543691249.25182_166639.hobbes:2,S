I was also under the belief that RFC1624 was handling this correctly.

This is how I am verifying the checksum. It seems to work in other 
cases. (by the way, I am working with the 2.4.20 kernel src code)
/* I do this check for only packets that are less than or equal to 76 
bytes in length. And I make sure the packets that I am dealing with are 
less than this length */
int tcpFailoverVerifyChecksum(struct sk_buff* skb)
{
     int len = skb->len - sizeof(struct iphdr);
     retValue = tcp_v4_check(skb->h.th, len,
                             skb->nh.iph->saddr, skb->nh.iph->daddr,
                             csum_partial((char *)skb->h.th, len, 0));
     return retValue;
}
Is the above function right? If not, what is the right way to verify the 
checksum of a tcp packet?

Ok...I will make the change... Thks...
