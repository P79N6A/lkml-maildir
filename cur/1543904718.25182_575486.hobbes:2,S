This is a bug in the driver.  The lookup table only goes to 133 MHz.
static char *pci_bus_modes[] = {
                "33", "66", "100", "133",
The same problem exists in the scsi_misc tree.

lspci only tells you capabilities, not the speed that the card is
running at.  I think you have to query the PCI bridge chipset to get
this information.  I have run a proprietary tool on this configuration
that does this and confirmed that the card is indeed running at 266 MHz.
