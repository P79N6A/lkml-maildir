first of all, i get the correct idt base. the problem is i cannot
dereference it, to get the interrupt entry i`m interrested in. second, i
have tried to get the right segment by pushl %ss / popl %ds . it has the
same behaviour. i would apreciate if you`d be more clear .. thanks in
advance for your help.
