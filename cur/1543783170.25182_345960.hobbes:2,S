Sounds sane. This is actually what I've done in Xgl to make it possible
to write some more interesting compositing managers. I implemented
GLX_MESA_render_texture so that a compositing manager can bind
redirected windows to textures and draw the screen using OpenGL.
Using OpenGL instead of X Render might very well be the way we end up
doing things. The current X Render API is sufficient for even more
complex cairo applications and that's good as they can then be
accelerated on servers without GL support. But you're probably right,
the next time we think of extending X Render we might want to reconsider
if that's such a good idea. If it's not likely that anything but a
OpenGL based server will accelerate it, then it might be a bad idea to
add it to X Render.
