Hmm...that might be a good idea.  :)

Well maybe a little bit on the production box, but I don't think its the
cause since the same thing happens on my home machine with a stock
Mandrake 9 kernel (2.4.19-16mdk).
Here's the test app:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/file.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
     int fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR);
     if (fd < 0)
     {
        perror("open");
        exit(-1);
     }
     printf("aquiring exclusive lock\n");
     int rc = flock(fd, LOCK_EX);
     if (rc < 0)
     {
        perror("flock");
        exit(-1);
     }
     printf("got lock\n");
     while(1)
        pause();
     return 0;
}
I start up four different instances of it in different windows, then
kill them (ctrl-c) in the order that I started them.
It doesn't happen every time, but they don't always get the lock in the
same order that I started them.
