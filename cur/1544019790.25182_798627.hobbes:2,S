Actually, we are locking against the destination CPU. Or perhaps I'm 
misunderstanding you.  The lock is protecting the destination data. The 
'cpu' variable  is the CPU we call to, not the current CPU.

I did not think an interrupt handler was allowed to do a 
smp_call_function. If it is, then you are correct and this is very buggy.
Both smp_call_function and smp_call_function have a:
	WARN_ON(irqs_disabled());
and comments saying that interrupts must be enabled and that these can
not be called from interrupt or softirq handlers.
The spin lock is to protect this scenario:
	task on CPU 0 sends IPI to CPU 2
	task on CPU 1 sends IPI to CPU 2
The first task to get past that spin lock (which is for CPU 2) will send 
the IPI. The second task will keep have to spin until the LOCK bit is 
cleared.
In other words, that spin lock is just a fancy:
 again:
	flags = per_cpu(csd_data).flags & ~CSD_FLAG_LOCK;
	if (cmpxchg(&per_cpu(csd_data, cpu).lock, flags,
	    flags | CSD_FLAG_LOCK) != flags) {
		cpu_relax();
		goto again;
	}

But these IPIs would not use the smp_call_function routines.

Again, this code is not allowed to run from an interrupt handler.
