Just one side note: kallsyms_lookup_name is _really_ inefficient. The 
kallsyms structure is tailored so that kallsyms_lookup (the most 
frequently used function) is really fast. Doing it the other way around 
involves a O(N) search, uncompressing every symbol name as it goes :P
I don't think this is really a performance problem for users like 
kprobes, but I just wanted people to keep in mind that there is a 
penalty involved in calling kallsyms_lookup_name.
