I disagree.  For a production product the you want minimal information
to reduce the communication bandwidth required between the remote
customer and the support organization.
In fact there is a good argument that you don't what the remote customer
to know enough to start guessing.  In the support stage of a products
life cycle you really don't want guessing or fudging of information
based on guessing.  Keeping the output cryptic and short will avoid
these things.  (That really does happen and it cost a lot in support
engineering time)

Oh poo.  Kernel programmers can use user mode tools and write them too,
and I *know* even I could write such a post processing program to take a
somewhat compressed and cryptic output and generate what would have been
created in the syslog used.  (in python)

Now it's been ~8 years since I did any serious windows work, but if I
recall correctly ALL THE FRICKING TIME!!! When was the last time you've
seen a bug check on windows?  This is about all you get.

From you comments I'm not sure you are for or against this idea.
