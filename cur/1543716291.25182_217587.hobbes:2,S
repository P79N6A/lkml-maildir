Good point, I hadn't thought of that one.
It works for most of the workloads I had in mind, but
you're right that it's not good enough for eg. the
university shell server.

True enough, but from my pov the flip side is that
merging the CKRM memory resource enforcement module
has the potential of undoing lots of the performance
tuning that was done to the VM in 2.6.
That could result in bad performance even for the
people who aren't using workload management at all...
