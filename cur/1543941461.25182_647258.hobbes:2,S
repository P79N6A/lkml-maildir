Hmm.. Your drive is raising ABRT on writes.  It can point to a number of
things including media access error and transmission error.  It's
basically a catch-all bit.  In the log, libata EH slowed down the device
to udma33 without any effect so I don't think it's transmission error
caused by cable misdetection or miswiring (mid connector connected to
the only drive on the cable).  What does 'smartctl -a' say about the drive?
