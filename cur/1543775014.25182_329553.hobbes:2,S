Well, there is nothing guaranteeing (either in the Linux implementation
or the code) that the in-memory changes are synced back to disk.  You
have to call msyc().

Yah, I am not--at all--talking about actual behavior.  Just that the
wording definitely says, its kind of been a common belief, that
MADV_DONTNEED literally ditches your data.  If you need it, don't call
MADV_DONTNEED.

It would have to discard the pages, losing the data, unless it caused
swapout (let's hope not).

Nod.
I think we need to resolve the differences between the man pages,
comments, expected user behavior, kernel implementation, POSIX standard,
and what other OS's do.  Figure out what to do, then unify everything.
