Tooting my own horn, but, anything in #gccbug I consider to be verified 
to -not- be hiding a real bug.  Human-verified not machine-verified, of 
course, so it's imperfect.  But at least it's been reviewed and 
considered carefully.
I'll look into "tarting up" #gccbug for upstream...  I had missed the 
introduction of uninitialized_var(), which was the genesis for this line 
of questioning.
