for my V2311US with Broadcom 4318 these drivers worked with ndiswrapper: 
ftp://ftp.support.acer-euro.com/notebook/ferrari_4000/driver/winxp64bit/80211g.zip
while these did not: 
http://www.broadcom.com/products/Wireless-LAN/802.11-Wireless-LAN-Solutions/BCM94318
PCIID: 14e4:4318
the ati-drivers 8.16.20 worked very well with the xpress 200 (ATI IXP) in it 
at 1280x768 (proprietary drivers seem to be a problem with software-suspend, 
which might be why i have not successfully resumed yet, vbetools to help here 
does not compile for me..yet?)
the twice as fast clock problem you will find several times on kernel.org's 
bugzilla for now add "noapic" to the kernel parameters, this works here at 
least till it is fixed (i havent tried booting 2.6.13 w/o it to be honest)
i get the charge of my battery, no info on current use 
through /proc/acpi/battery
have not really tried using mmc slot
i hope this helps you anything
