Even though inode of foo is gone? OK, fine with me. Do you mean that your
"locality" is roughly an equivalent of cylinder group on FFS?

Umm... I'd still like to hear a description of your internal locking. In
particular, what do you lock/release upon reiserfs_find_entry()/pathrelse()?
When do you rebalance the tree? How do you do serialization between that
and things a-la write_inode()/readdir()/lookup()? Currently locking is
masked by the VFS one and that's one of the reasons why I want to see
cleaned variant.
