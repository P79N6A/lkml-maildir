You can get the official toolchain from this page:
http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=4118
I'm not sure about crosstool, but you can get a patched version of
buildroot from this page:
http://www.atmel.no/buildroot/
Maybe you can just grab the patches from buildroot and use them with
crosstool? Or I can send them to you if you don't want to download the
whole thing.
