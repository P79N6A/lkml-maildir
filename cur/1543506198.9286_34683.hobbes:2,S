Hello.
I need my test driver to allocate some memory that is physically contigues.
the way i do it is 
user program issues a mmap() call to the driver with a specific offset.
when this value is identified in the kernel the driver does the following.
kernel:
	buf = __get_free_pages(...);
	for (i = MAP_NR(buf); i<=MAP_NR(buf + size -1);i++)
		set_bit(PG_reserved, &mem_map[i].flags);
	paddr = __pa(buf);
	
	if (remap_page_range(vma->vm_start, paddr, size, vma->vm_page_prot))
		return -EAGAIN;
	else
		return 0;
when the user process closes the handle while the release() procedure is
getting called i do the reverse of the above
- clear_bit(PG_reserved)
- free_pages()
this seems to work fine, except that after the free pages still i dont see
the available memory increasing in /proc/meminfo. so the memory leaks and
finally iam not able to allocate using __get_free_pages(). is something
wrong here from what iam doing?
