On the other hand, the filesystem writers here are declaring their own
setattr operation. Is it unreasonable for them to take responsibility
for handling this too? 
There are other in-tree filesystems that likely need to have this check
omitted (other networked filesystems in particular), but this
patchset tries to make this change transparent for now. Those authors
can go back and fix this up later.
As Trond said, in-tree filesystems will be converted so they won't
be an issue. The only danger is someone who is running unconverted
out-of-tree filesystem code on a kernel with this patch. Is that enough
of an issue to warrant us taking extra steps to deal with it?
Another alternative might be to rename notify_change(). I don't really
like gratuitously breaking the API, though, and that function is
referenced in a lot of documentation. Changing it might be confusing...
