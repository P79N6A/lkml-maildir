This implies that an allocation at time t2 must be aware of the result of 
an allocation at time t1. It assumes a linear ordering of allocations that 
is not possible on large systems. Ordering of events is a very expensive 
endeavor in particular on NUMA systems given the potentially large 
latencies between various portions of the system.
Maybe you need to restrict the ordering per cpu or per node? Per zone? 
Then we would need to store the ranks somewhere which raises scalability 
issues if these are global.
