This whole scheme looks buggy.  The intent is to 8-byte align
the object, but look at what the code is actually doing.
Whatever kmalloc() returns to xfrm_offload_alloc() is directly
used as the xfrm_offload pointer, and the members are initialized.
Then xfrm_offload_priv() does the alignments.
It is clear that kmalloc() is always giving you 8-byte aligned
data else the first time xfrm_offload_priv() is used you'd
get a bogus pointer since xfrm_offload_alloc() initialized
the object without first aligning the pointer.
We do something similar when we allocate netdevs, so have a look
at how net/core/dev.c:alloc_netdev() works.
