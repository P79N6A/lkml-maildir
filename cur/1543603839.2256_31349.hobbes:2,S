Good.

It's intentional, although something that can probably be discussed. The
reasons for it are:
 - devices with broken or unreliable disk change mechanisms
 - the current dynamic [de-]allocation of block device data structures.
 - historical coherency reasons.
None of the reasons for it are very strong - the block device data
structure one is a _current_ implementation detail that has a lot of
reasons going for it, but it's not something that is inherent in any real
major design (we could reasonably easily delay the block device data
structure release for some time).

Well, I actually champion not considering writes accesses _at_all_, but I
was overruled by Marcelo Tosatti. However, I bet that a good example would
change his mind - and a benchmark.
This is easy to test: remove the "SetPageReferenced(page);" from the
generic_file_write() function (note how the current code is a mix between
my "writes aren't references" and Marcelo's "writes are accesses like
reads" - it only marks a page referenced, it never actually activates it).
Are there other valid points in this discussion? I'd love to have a strong
reason for doing what we're doing (which we don't have right now).

No, activating the pages only makes them slightly harder to get rid of,
they don't become "pinned".
