I don't want to break all the other architectures. Or at least not most of 
them. Especially since I was hoping to do a -pre2 soon (well, like today, 
but I guess that's out..) and make the 2.6.11 cycle shorter than 2.6.10.
So I'd like to now _first_ get
>   spin_can_lock(lock)
>   read_can_lock(lock)
>   write_can_lock(lock)
for at least most architectures (ie for me at a minimum that is x86,
x86-64, ia64 and ppc64 - and obviously the "always true" cases for the 
UP version).
Ok?
Also, I've already made sure that I can't apply any half-measures by 
mistake by undoing the mess that it was before, and making sure that any 
patches I get have to be "clean slate".
That said, I like how just the _renaming_ of the thing (and making them 
all consistent) made your BUILD_LOCK_OPS() helper macro much simpler. So 
I'm convinced that this is the right solution - I just want to not screw 
up other architectures.
I can do ppc64 myself, can others fix the other architectures (Ingo, 
shouldn't the UP case have the read/write_can_lock() cases too? And 
wouldn't you agree that it makes more sense to have the rwlock test 
variants in asm/rwlock.h?):
