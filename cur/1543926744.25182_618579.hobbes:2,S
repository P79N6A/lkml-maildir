Subject: [PATCH] NR_OPEN should be raised a litle bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Time has come to change NR_OPEN value, some production servers hit the
not so 'ridiculously high value' of 1024*1024 file descriptors per process.
This is safe to raise this value, because alloc_fd_array() uses
vmalloc() for large arrays and vmalloc() returns NULL if a too large
allocation is attempted (or in case of memory shortage)
Moore law implies this limit should be changed every 1-2 years, and it seems
we forgot doing this for ages.
Even on my old notebook, a process can open 1000000 descriptors without any 
problem.
