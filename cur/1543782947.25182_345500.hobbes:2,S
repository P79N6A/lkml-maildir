The problem is that people made bad experiences with home-phoning software 
in the past. Changing their opinion about this issue isn't easy I think.
I can almost see the headlines: Spy software found in recent Linux 
kernels... :o)
Although home-phoning can be useful under certain circumstances it is the 
wrong way to implement it in a kernel. IMHO a userspace tool is the better 
solution: Everyone can decide if he/she wants to report what kernel 
version is running on their systems.

This could be a sloution but like you know UDP packets may or may not 
arrive the destination address. So the packet loss with this method could 
be very high, expecially if you send only one packet. Using a 
TCP-connection for this is a lot more stable and the payload can be 
encrypted too.
Once again: I think this is a userspace task.
