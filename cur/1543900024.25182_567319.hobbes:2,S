I don't think it makes any change to subsequent flow but the code in 
pci_mmcfg_check_hostbridge is:
pci_mmcfg_config_num = 0;
...
if (name) {
	printk(KERN_INFO "PCI: Found %s %s MMCONFIG support.\n",
	       name, pci_mmcfg_config_num ? "with" : "without");
}
So it will always prints "without".
I'd make a patch but I'm not sure what this fix is. Just drop the test, 
the printk or make it say "which might possibly have"?
Cheers,
Scott
