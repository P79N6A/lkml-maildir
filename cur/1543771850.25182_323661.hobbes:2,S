No, I also looked into this, it is not needed for the tulip driver, it
detects that it has no access to the hardware (reading 0xffffffff) in the
interrupt functions.

Pavel told me, that pci_choose_state is not always safe, some cards maybe
do only work with PCI_D3hot properly, so it's better to use this now.
For my hardware it also seems to work with pci_choose_state.

I think restoring the PCI config should be done always, not only if the
device was in the up state, also powerup should be done.
If not you will run into problems to use the device later.
