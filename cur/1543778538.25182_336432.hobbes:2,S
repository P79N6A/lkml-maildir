I'd really rather not have to get into that level of divergence.  Usually,
patches in -mm should be directly applicable to -linus.

OK.  The way I handle an exceptional case like that is to merge the
-linus-compatible patch into -mm and then have another patch on top of that
which fixes things up for the -mm tree.  Later, that patch gets folded into
your patch if Pavel's stuff gets merged.  Or gets dropped if it doesn't get
merged.  Or gets folded into Pavel's stuff if your patch goes in first.
IOW: for a bunch of reasons we really do want to make the "fix up V4l for
-mm differences" patch be a separate patch file.
And I very much prefer that people work against -linus and when these
things occasionally pop up I'll just fix stuff up.  It's only if someone is
explicitly working against a patch which is only in -mm that they should
have to care about -mm vs -linus differences.

Well, if you really, really, really feel a need to do this then feel free
to send along a patch which does whatever you need it to do.
But as I say, I'd prefer that you be raising patches against -linus and
testing them in -mm.
