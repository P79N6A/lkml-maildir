ok so to summarize things a bit (I'll admit bias here but still ;)
1) having a per driver function to say "I'd like extended config space" is ok
   (it's the driver that knows what is needed after all)
2) we need a way for userspace to do the same for a given device
   (which then will print a nice warning who does what to whom)
3) we need to have the "no extended config space unless someone wants it" behavior
4) It's inevitable that this will end up being per device given that we'll end up with
   per device "this one is b0rked" quirks over time (even shortly)
5) architectures that have sane extended config space access should just be able to provide
   it always. This could even be on x86 based on BIOS date (say 2009 :)
the patch I posted does 1) 3) 4) and the first half of 5)
I'll update the patch to do 2) and the rest of 5)
Is there anything I skipped in the summary above?
(and yes I realize this needs lspci to be expanded some to set the flag if the admin really asks for it, 
but such is life)
