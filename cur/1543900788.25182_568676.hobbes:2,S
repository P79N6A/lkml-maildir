    You have to either repartition when you upgrade your memory, or
waste a bunch of disk space with a partition as large as you think
your RAM might ever expand to.
    Swap/hibernate files can be created, deleted, and resized without
partitioning.
    Also: not all platforms support a large number of partitions.
It's not academic -- Intel Macintoshes are limited to four, with two
taken by Mac OS.  Add Windows and a Linux /, and you're out --
there's no room for a swap file.
