My mailer seems to have deleted the part of the email with your redesign
suggestion in it...
My initial point is that the current scsi_reap_target() infrastructure
is more broken than the new API, so it does represent an improvement.  I
could also mitigate (but not solve) the problem by adding a wqw slab.
However, I really think the redesign would be along the lines I
suggested to Jens; do you agree?
