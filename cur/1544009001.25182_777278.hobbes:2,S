fully agreed.
While most of the flat profilers like oprofile will be happy with the PC 
alone, i do think we want a couple of extended notification types.
Right now we begun with the most trivial ones:
  enum perf_record_type {
          PERF_RECORD_SIMPLE,
          PERF_RECORD_IRQ,
  };
... but it would be natural to do a PERF_RECORD_GP_REGISTERS as well. 
Perhaps even a PERF_RECORD_STACKTRACE using the sysprof facilities, to do 
a hierarchic multi-dimension profile that sysprof does so nicely.
Note that the record type is an independent attribute of a counter. It 
can be set regardless of the even type - and it can be set independently 
for each counter. So you can have say 3 'simple' counters with no irqs 
plus one 'all registers' counter which generates an IRQ: and then you can 
read out the simple counters at the same type.
We could also perhaps do a PERF_RECORD_ALL: it represents a snapshot of 
all active counter values in the task. This is _far_ better than forcibly 
scheduling the monitored task.
