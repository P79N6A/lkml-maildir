I'm very much sure this feature (having a server locked, while
keyboard/screen is accessible) is much LESS useful than being able to
stop an suspend in progress. That's if the suspend isn't lightning fast,
of course, which is is not.
Unfortunately, while you can route the start-suspend command through
userspace (init, whatever) like the reboot command is, but I fear when
the suspend is in progress, it's not possible to talk to userspace
anymore ...
