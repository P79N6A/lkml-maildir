Thanks for report. That patch did not help Willy, and now you have confirmed 
there still is an SMP balancing problem too where it doesn't seem to keep all 
cpus busy. There's still a bug there in the smp balancing code and I'm 
reviewing it madly trying to find it. If anyone else knows this balancing 
code and is willing to help I'd be happy for feedback if they can see an 
obvious error. Likely thing is the runqueue is not being weighted at all 
despite being bust so the other runqueue doesn't try to take any tasks from 
it.
