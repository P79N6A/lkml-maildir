That's why you do
	*p = (struct foo){....};
instead of
	memset(p, 0, sizeof...);
	p->... =...;
Note that in a lot of cases your memset(p, 0, sizeof(*p)) is actually wrong -
e.g. when you've allocated a struct + some array just past it.
Oh, and in your case above...  *p = 0; is certainly saner than that memset(),
TYVM ;-)
I'm serious about compound literals instead of memset() - they give sane
typechecking for free and give compiler a chance for saner optimizations.
And no, it's not a gcc-ism - it's valid C99.
