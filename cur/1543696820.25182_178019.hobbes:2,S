Ok. That panic is obviously crud from a lazy initial developer, and yes, 
it's always silly (and very very wrong) to crash if you can just continue.
Can you send the (tested) patch over?

I think it's a Linux bug too, although I'll agree that it was triggered by 
some really bad BIOS behaviour. I bet the laptop vendor doesn't care: they 
probably depend on ACPI to set the thing up on Windows, and Windows is 
likely to just ignore the MP table (properly) when it doesn't need it (or 
when it is corrupt).

I really think that the Linux behaviour i smore of a bug than the BIOS 
behaviour. There's no excuse for panicing just because some signature 
for a data block that we don't even strictly need isn't there.
