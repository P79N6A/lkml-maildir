I can see that. Unfortunately any form of "grabbing" just makes it all
worse in the long run. The problem is that some programs rely on X to
deliver events while others use device nodes (eventX, mouseX, or
super-new blahX) for their data. When X server grabs the devices it
interferes with other programs running on the same box making them
dependent on X configuration. I have the feeling that best course
would be for X to work out its own input handling and any
filtering/asking that is necessary.
