Its not like you cant reclaim the page as if it were __init afterwards. One
sensible thing the m68k people did with their ever growing subtly changing
boot info records is to switch to a tagged list for stuff the booter passes
Now all the parsing code can be __init so its not a size issue, and its
fairly easy to parse
[tag][size][data]
sequences as well as buring the compatibility issues and boot loader
compatibility problems we have to worry about now for a lot of stuff
