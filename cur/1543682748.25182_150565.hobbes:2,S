I'll complain to HP about that.

Yes that patch would IMHO point users with broken BIOS tables in the right
direction.

I think you know a bit more about these matters than me, so please allow me this
question:
How much risk do you think that would be (with the usual 'you are not responible
for any damages' stuff as usual) to just use that entry? At with the performance
governour it is exactly the same as displayed as currently by x86info so that
shouldn't be a problem. Do you think that lower frequencies and voltages can
kill the processor? [I can cope with instabilities]
Thank you for your help.
