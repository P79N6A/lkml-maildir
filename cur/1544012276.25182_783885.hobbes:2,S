Hi Lukas,
Did the undroppable memory keep growing?
If not, we could take it as a feature instead of bug: the memory
mapped pages are being protected from being freed.  It's not a
regression either: the feature was there before 2.6.27.
But sure we change that if it's not the desirable behavior.
Thanks,
Fengguang
