I personally don't use teh 3ware raid features at all, I use the card
as a high performance interface to 4 drives and do my own backups
(I mirror each disk to /nightly, /weekly, and /monthly which is kind
of neat because you can do "$ diff foo.c /nightly/$PWD" and it works,
saves a lot of headaches).
Are there decent alternatives if all you want is a high performance
JBOD controller?
