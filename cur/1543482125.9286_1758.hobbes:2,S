My two cents worth:
The ptrace code is fragile.  I had a test program that would make the
kernel spin in put_long while holding the kernel lock.  I didn't make
the test program by looking for boundary test cases; I made it by running
mec-replay in the normal course of development, watching my kernel hang,
and boiling down a test case.
I think a good place to start is to put a loop counter in get_long
and put_long in arch/*/kernel/ptrace.c and log messages or panic
if the loop counter exceeds 1000.  Also drop in some printk's at
the beginning and end of sys_ptrace catch the call sequence.  Then add
another two dozen printk's, et cetera.
