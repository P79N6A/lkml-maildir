I'll say this yet again:
Heinz Mauelshagen is maintaining LVM1.0.x on 2.4 kernels.  This is for
bug fixes only, no new features will be added.
Alasdair Kergon, Patrick Caulfield and myself are working on the more
generic device-mapper driver for both 2.4/2.5.  Initially we have
concentrated on 2.4, this driver is now very stable IMO (I would
certainly trust my data to it in preference to LVM1).
I will post a URL to the 2.5 patch at some point this week.
There is no intention to maintain the broken design that is LVM1 in
the 2.5 series - we do not have the spare resources to waste.
