I just mention it because many people's ideas of merging files
seem to add lots of ifdefs which is imho the totally wrong thing
to do.

See the recent "quiet down swiotlb warnings" thread which uncovered
quite some corpses in Xen's current IO setup.
Xen apparently bounces for multi page IOs which get merged from block
lists because the block layer doesn't know they are not really 
continuous in machine memory.
Proper fix is to tell the block layer to not merge in the first
place instead.
And probably some similar mechanism for network drivers that limits
MTUs.
Maybe we'll still need a simple bouncing mechanism for other obscure
devices with large IOs then, but I would very much prefer if it wasn't 
swiotlb and could be solved some other way.
