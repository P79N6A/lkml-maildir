For "make headers_install" this is not good.
But I see there is confliting usages here.
1) current functionality makes it easy to build a cross compiled m68k
2) suggested functionality makes it easy to do make headers_install
Btw. if you did:
CROSS_COMPILE ?= m68k-linux-
then I could do:
export CROSS_COMPILE=my-m68k-linux-
make
and still get the expected result.
