This is the only manageable long term way of doing it.
As the number of different types of CPU profierates the combinations of
features will become more and more complicated.
The kernel code then becomes simpler: #ifdefs being on a feature by
feature basis.
We still need to retain 'i386' & friends, but the only use is to be
expanded (in some header file) into all the features that that CPU
supports.
This allows end users to properly configure their machines: they will
more easily understand that they have a brand X CPU than they will know
which particular flavour of MMU it supports.
This will need a bit of work, but will be worth it. However, leave this
for release 2.3.
