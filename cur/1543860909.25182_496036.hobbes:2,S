It is. Are you still seeing problems after the initial mail exchange we
had prior to christmas, or are you referencing that initial problem?
It's not likely to be a block layer issue, more likely the SCSI <->
block interactions. If you mail me a new dmesg (if your problem is with
the __blk_run_queue() fixups), I can take a look. Otherwise please do
test with the __blk_run_queue() fixup, just use the current patchset.
