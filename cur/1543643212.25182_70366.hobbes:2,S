One imho major problem with the new scheduler is that its new
sched_yield breaks programs like OpenOffice, who rely on the old
sched_yield behaviour. With new scheduler and 2.5 yield  OpenOffice
can be completely starved just by a kernel compile because sched_yield
kills all its time slices.
I don't think a stable release should break programs in such a way.
