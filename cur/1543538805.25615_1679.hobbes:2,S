Hi, I need to know what are the files that have to be changed when
porting linux to another plataform , I guess that all the files under
asm/ have to be changed, but where can I find some doc about this files
and other hardware-dependet sources?
I need this info to port linux to one of the encore microcontrolers,
thanks.
