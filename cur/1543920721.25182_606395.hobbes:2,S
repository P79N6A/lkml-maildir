Yes, but even udev won't give you one and the same symlink to the disk's
device file then.¹  There isn't a persistent unique target/unit property
which all of these transports have in common.
The only thing that could be common in the best case is the symlink to
the partition's device file, based on filesystem UUID or filesystem label.
¹) unless you write your own rule specific to this on particular enclosure
