Why?
It's quite likely that especially on a fairly idle machine, the dentry 
cache really _should_ be the biggest single memory user.
Why? Because an idle machine tends to largely be dominated by things like 
"updatedb" and friends running. If there isn't any other real activity, 
there's no reason for a big page cache, nor is there anything that would 
put memory pressure on the dentries, so they grow as much as they can.
Do you see any actual bad behaviour from this?
