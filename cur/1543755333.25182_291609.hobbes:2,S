Dear Linux Kernel,
I visited your site today and think that the content could be of use to 
some of my customers. I am looking for reputable websites to send my 
visitors to, and was wondering if you would like to exchange links with 
me.Us linking to each other would increase where we stand with the 
search engines, and in addition it would be benificial because of the 
traffic we would be sending each other. The best part is that it would 
be free traffic.
I am currently looking to expand my catagories to 10 sites. I will do 
this by adding the first responses I get. If you are interested in 
trading with me, email me the retorical url where my site is placed. I 
will then add your url within 24 hours. Please email me any catagory 
name you want your link to be placed in. If its not already on my site, 
I will create it for you. Please contact me if you have any other 
busieness suggestions or ideas on how we could make a partnership 
between our businesses.
