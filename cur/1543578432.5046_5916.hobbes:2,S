Subject: has anyone patched NVIDIA_kernel to work with 2.4.0?

Between 2.4.0-test10 and 2.4.0 enough stuff changed that I can't get
the OpenGL NVIDIA_kernel module compiled and linked properly.  Has
anyone else taken a shot at this?
I realize this is a little bit OT, since it's something that nvidia
ought to be handling, but thus far they've failed to respond to my
e-mail.
	Thanks,
