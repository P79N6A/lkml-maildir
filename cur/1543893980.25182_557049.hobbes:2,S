IANAL so I won't comment on the legal aspects of TiVo's doing.
However it definitely is against _MY_ understanding of the spirit
of the GPL. At least to me that's quite obvious. I'm sure you all
know the story of the printer driver RMS couldn't fix that reportedly
made him start the whole FSF business.
Looking at what TiVo did I realize glaring similarities.
<disclaimer>
I'm in no way related with the FSF. I hereby state I'm not parroting
anyone's else position but have come to this conclusion solely on
my own.

Come on! The whole idea of software is to have it run on some HW.
Why would I want to change it in the first place if I can't run it ?
If what they did is actually allowed by the wording of the legal phrases
of the GPLv2 then that IMO is a loophole w/r to the spirit (as I understand)
it and IMO should be plugged.

Would not such a restriction voilate the spirit of the GPL ?
Anyway, my simplistic view is:
Once it is under the GPL I could change it and actually make the
changes work as I see fit.
That's what I think my freedom as of the GPL is about.
Now all that needs to be done is make sure the legal phrases are such
that they convince the judges they actually mean this in court too.
Best wishes,
Michael
