Subject: [PATCH 000/003] Remove getnstimestamp()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	This series removes the getnstimestamp() function from kernel/time.c in
favor of kernel/hrtimer.c's ktime_get_ts() function which currently does
exactly the same thing: retrieves a high-resolution (ns) timespec
structure and performs the wall_to_monotonic adjustment.
	As Jay Lan suggested I was going to replace calls to getnstimestamp()
with do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime() but the hrtimer patches switched
that to a macro. ktime_get_ts() is shorter and avoids unnecessary
association with posix timers (though it does not emphasize monotonicity
or resolution).
The series:
001/003 export-ktime_get_ts.patch
	Exports ktime_get_ts()
002/003 proc-events-use-ktime-for-timestamp.patch
	Switches the only user of getnstimestamp() to ktime_get_ts()
003/003 rm-getnstimestamp.patch
	Remove getnstimestamp() from kernel/time.c
Thanks,
	-Matt Helsley
