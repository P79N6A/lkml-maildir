Hi,
I have found a re-producable bug with RedHat v6.0 2.2.10 kernel, pcmcia
3.0.13.
Using a Xircom CE3 10/100 PCMCIA card. Enabling IPX - "ipx_configure
--auto_interface=on --auto_primary=on"
As soon as you login to the Novel (4.11) server (either pqlist -S
NOVELL_SERVER -U username or ncpmount -U NOVEL_SERVER -U username
/mnt/ncp) the laptop locks solid. Can not ping it, k/board locks - no
virtual screens etc, Nothing in the log files either.
Any idea where to start ?
I feel it's the xircom drivers however nothing to verify the fact.
Regards
Mark Harvey
