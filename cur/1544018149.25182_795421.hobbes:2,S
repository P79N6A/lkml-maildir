Sorry all for introducing the problem in the first place.
Other option for a fix would be to move the lock into the 
regulator_notifier_call_chain function.  Probably not ideal as would lead
to possibility of releasing then immediately retaking the lock that we
were trying to avoid by pushing the locks out in the first place.
Guess it's a case of how much we want to put people off directly accessing
elements of regulator_dev.
Thanks for posting the fix Mark (just beat me to it ;)
