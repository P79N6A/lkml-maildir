Thank you for the pointer!  By this, you mean do mount operations in
conjunction with namespaces, right?
I will follow up with more detail as I learn more.  The current issue
seems to be with removeable devices.  Their users want to be accessing
a particular version, but still see a memory stick that was subsequently
mounted outside of the view.  Straightforward use of mounts and namespaces
would prevent the memory stick from being visible to users that were
already in view.
							Thanx, Paul
