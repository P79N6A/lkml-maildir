There was a long discussion thread about this a while back. There were a
lot of differing views but in the end no patch to fix up power.c to do
anything was accepted. The Zaurus was the reason I raised the issue.
It seems power.c was recently removed as it was dead code.

The proposed changes to power.c were to hook it into things like APM as
a "user" event so the power button triggered a suspend event but
anything in userspace needing to know about (or veto) it could do so.

Currently I still patch this functionality into the Zaurus kernels
(basically by resurrecting power.c with the patches I used to apply to
it added in):
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/input_power-r9.patch
This works for 2.6.23 but doesn't seem to work in 2.6.23-git9. I've not
looked into why yet.
In the current climate, this will never make mainline kernels so I will
be considering other options such as adding support into something like
OHM. As yet, I've not found the time to do that and since the above
patch works and is relatively easy to maintain...
Cheers,
Richard
