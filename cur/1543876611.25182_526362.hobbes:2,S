If we don't reserve irqs that the hardware doesn't support we should
be able to simply move the allocation and have about the same cost as
we do today.

Agreed.  It is the second call to pci_enable_device() by a driver where
things really start to unravel in the wait until we need it plan.

Mostly that is a matter of porting the code from x86_64 where that is
already the case.  I'm pretty certain I have worked through all of
the bit issues, but there might be a few small problems that crop up.
If need by I will do the patches as I find time.  But if someone else gets
there before I do that would be great :)
