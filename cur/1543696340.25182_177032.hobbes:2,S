I mentioned ide tapes and ZIP drives, Linus didn't mention how one gets
around those.

And I don't see the joy of doing so. Unless someone wants to write new
versions of all the SCSI software out in use, a lot of functionality is
lost. In the long run it might have been better to simply fix or rewrite
ide-scsi and stop using the ide interface, becuase disk manufacturers
certainly aren't going to stop making scsi and it needs to be supported
anyway. I guess Doug Gilbert is doing other things now, I would have
expected at least an opinion out of him ;-)
