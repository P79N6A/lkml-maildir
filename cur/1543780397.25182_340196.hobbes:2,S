I have Samsung dvd-rom and Via chipset (Apollo Pro 133A):
    hdc: SAMSUNG DVD-ROM SD-608, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
    VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686b (rev 40) IDE UDMA100 controller on pci0000:00:07.1
	ide0: BM-DMA at 0xa000-0xa007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
	ide1: BM-DMA at 0xa008-0xa00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
Computer boots okey, and 'hdparm' shows that DMA is enabled on 'hdc'
But, when I try to play DVD using 'xine', I get into infinite loop, with
error messages
    /var/log/syslog:
	hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
	ide: failed opcode was: unknown
	hdc: ATAPI reset complete
	end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 299056
	Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 37382
    
    /var/log/messages:
	ide-cd: cmd 0x28 timed out
which repeat every minute.
Has anyone encountered this before, and solved it?  A DVD drive without
DMA is pretty useless. :-(
