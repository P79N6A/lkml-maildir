[root@thedog mike]# hdparm -i /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Model=ST39140A, FwRev=841260, SerialNo=AY073758
I have the above drive.  I don't get a missing interrupt per se, I
get a DMA timeout.  However, if you are using DMA, the errors
appear to be similar.  I can also cause the same error on an ACER
CDROM when UDMA/33 is enabled.  Kernel 2.2.14 with the IDE patch.
The common thread seems to be a PIIX4.  Is this correct?  I can
also create the problem in single user mode, without a network
driver module loaded.  I never actually tried removing the card...
Those of you that only see the hang when running X: suppose you
boot to single user mode and run a number of tests
similar to:
dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=1024 count=60000 skip=nnnnnn
(increment nnnnnn to avoid caching on successive tests)
(or hdparm -t /dev/hda)
Do you get a hang?  Are you using UDMA/33?
