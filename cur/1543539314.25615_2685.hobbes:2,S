I have the same problem (i.e., error message) with an old Pentium 100
with 2.4.0-test4. My system will not boot a bzImage either. I would
rather boot a bzImage instead of a zImage because it is getting more
and more difficult to build a kernel that is small enough to use a
zImage version. 
I would like to use the 2.4.0 version for its USB support and the MTD
(the 65 to 128 Mb are not cached by CPU so it would be better to use
that extra memory as swap).
Thank you for the Linux kernel.
