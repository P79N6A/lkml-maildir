I am trying to configure Alsa from within menuconfig enviroment.
I get this message:
Q> ./scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu74: command not found
The kernel i am using is version 2.5.40, and the menu is as soon as i
choos SOUND -> Advanced sound architecture!
It probably is the fact that i havnt updated Alsa yet, but i have no idea
why i Menuconfig just dumps back to the shell in that case!!
/regards
