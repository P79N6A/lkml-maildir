aio_* functions are library routines in glibc that are implemented by 
spawning threads to use the normal kernel io syscalls.  They don't use 
real async IO in the kernel.  I'm not sure why you didn't see the 
thread, but if you look up the glibc sources you will see how it works.
To use the kernel aio you make calls to io_submit().
