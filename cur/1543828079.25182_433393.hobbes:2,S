Hi,
  i am porting a driver from 2.4 to 2.6.
   I went thru the porting guide available in lwn.net. some parts of
the document is difficult to follow for begineers.
  am confused.
  Could any one let me know what changes i need to make in a 2.4 driver
  as far as /proc interface is concerned.
  Should i make any new additions to support sysfs?.  am cofused
regarding the need
  of sysfs when /proc is already there.
  Could anyone help me on this.
  pointers will be very helpful.
Regards,
sriram
