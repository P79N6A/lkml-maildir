Doc/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt says that "help" or "---help---" is OK.
It also seems to recommend some indentation under "help", but doesn't
say what that is.  Roman seems to use TAB + "help" and then
TAB SPACE SPACE <help text> under the "help" keyword, but it's not
codified anywhere that I know of.
