Well, X isn't supposed to keep the ROM enabled is it ? besides, most of
the time, the kernel code will be run at boot. I think we shouldn't care
here. If X does the wrong thing, it will eventually break but it
shouldn't break in the "normal" case and it will ultimately be fixed
(finger crossed) by R7.1
