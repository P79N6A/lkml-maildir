Seriously, if readability is your argument, macro magic is not the
answer. Ok, we can't clobber the CPU_ definitions, so pick another
prefix.
If you want readability, please consider using named enums:
enum cpu_feature {
	CF_ALTIVEC = /* ... */
};
static inline int cpu_has_feature(enum cpu_feature cf) { }
