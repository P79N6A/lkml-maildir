I believe I have mine still lying around somewhere; if you are
interested (and willing to tell me a shippable address ;)) I'd
try to find it and send it over. I also probably still have
one or two ISA soundcards with Sony connector (one with Opti
chipset and a "highend" Yamaha Waveforge with additional cool
stuff... ;))
While we are at it I also have a Dawicontrol UW SCSI Controller
with Symbios Logic chipset to offer and two SCSI CD-Rom drives.
If someone expresses interest in this ancient stuff I'd be happy
to arrange some shipment.
Servus,
       Daniel
