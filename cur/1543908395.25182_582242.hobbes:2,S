Indeed, as the EBDA_ADDR_POINTER is not aligned, this may work even better.
It seems to me safe to assume that if we read zero on that line:
ebda_addr = *(unsigned short *)__va(EBDA_ADDR_POINTER);
We could just do ebda_size = 0 and go home happy, skipping the rest of 
the process.
Andi, are you okay with it ?
