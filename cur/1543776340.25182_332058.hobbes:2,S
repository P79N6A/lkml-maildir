2.4 is weaker: it has to allocate memory from the main page allocator when
performing swapout.  2.6 avoids that.

The latter.  Create the swapfile when the filesystem is young and empty,
it'll be nice and contiguous.  Once created the kernel will never add or
remove blocks.  The kernel won't let you use a sparse file for a swapfile.

None at all.  The kernel generates a map of swap offset -> disk blocks at
swapon time and from then on uses that map to perform swap I/O directly
against the underlying disk queue, bypassing all caching, metadata and
filesystem code.
