I'm talking a very low level driver that simply provides safe serialized access
to the hardware. Clipping belongs in Xlib or wherever it's needed. Of course if
the hardware provides clipping, then it should go in the driver, and it would be
up to the user mode libraries/applications such as Xlib to use it if it exists.
Of course, you could move the emulate-if-missing code out of Xlib into a non-X
library as I suggested, but simply adopting device drivers to serialize hardware
access doesn't force you to do that.
