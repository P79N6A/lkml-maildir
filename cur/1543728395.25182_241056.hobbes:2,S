A script would be cool, but dd doesn't do the memory locking and real 
time priority stuff.  I don't know how important this is - how old your 
hardware would have to be for you to get "coasters" (buffer underun) 
without it.

Theres an option in cdrecord to fixate an arbitrary disk (one without a 
TOC for whatever reason), and one not to fixate the disk you're writing, 
so it looks like fixation could and should be done on demand using an 
ioctl.  You'd also need ioctls to deal with multiple sessions.
I think most people would want a cdrwtool that basically pretends to be 
cdrecord (in some ways ;), because thats the most intuitive way to do it 
- even if you can do everything you want to with cdrwtool for the ioctls 
and dd for the data.
I've definitely underestimated the problems with my idea, and I can't 
see any tangible benefits which couldn't be obtained by hacking 
cdrecord.  Idealistically, its the right thing to do - but in practice 
its unessecary, I'm not up to the job, and its not attractive enough for 
someone to pick up.  After packet writing is seamlessly merged into the 
uniform cdrom driver it might start looking more important, and I might 
have learnt enough to at least implement a proof of concept.  I'm still 
interested in hashing out more details and potential benefits.
