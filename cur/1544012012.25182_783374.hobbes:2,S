Seems I'm talking to myself, but I think I finally decoded the
mystery:
resume()
  cpufreq_resume()
    tsc:time_cpufreq_notifier()
      set_cyc2ns_scale()
        sched_clock_idle_sleep_event()
          sched_clock_tick()
            ktime_get()
              hpet_read()
This happens _BEFORE_ timekeeping has resumed, so hpet_read() returns
nonsense and the timekeeping code uses the stale pre suspend
xtime/clocksource reference values to calculate the time. So the gtod
reference in sched_clock can result in total crap depending on the
time when the suspend happened.
Shaggys patch clamps sched_clock to the stale scd->clock value which
might explain the further wreckage.
The above sequence happens only for CPUs with a CPU frequency coupled
TSC, so on newer machines with CPU frequency invariant TSC this does
not happen.
/me stomps off to find a box to confirm that.
