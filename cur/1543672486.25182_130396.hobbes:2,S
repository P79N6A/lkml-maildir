I'd get to define "the OS" so that is not a problem :) You could
expect an equivalent "clear syscall message", although that is more
problematic to define in an environment where there is no static code
being executed.

There are a few GPL'd Java programs around (I've written a couple
myself), and no complaints about the above transformation so far.

I was going to write:
   I think you've made a big jump in logic there.  I sympathise, as I too
   might have to quit computing if European law follows the US, but I
   don't agree with the big leap you just made.
But then (<shudder>) I realised you are right.  The kind of kernel
which I'm envisioning would be capable of cracking open some kinds of
protected application automatically, as a mere side effect.  (It has
powerful DWIM semantics :) And that would make _something_ illegal to
write - I'm not sure what, though.
