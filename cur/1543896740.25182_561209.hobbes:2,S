Actually, in my next series, I removed patch 5 and just simply replace
the tasklets with the workqueue implementation, leaving no config
option. It will be out shortly, after I finish my testing.
I also keep the file name tasklet_work.c instead of overwriting
tasklet.c, just because it's easier to review the patch that way.
