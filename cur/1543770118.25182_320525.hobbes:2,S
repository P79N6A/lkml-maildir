this reminds me, people very much notice the difference between an LCD 
that has 20 msec refresh rates vs. ones that have 10 msec refresh rates.
i'd say the direct perception limit should be somewhere around 10 msec, 
but there can be indirect effects that add up. (e.g. while we might not 
be able to detect so small delays directly, the human eye can see 
_distance_ anomalies that are caused by small delays. E.g. the feeling 
of how 'smoothly' the mouse moves might be more accurate than direct 
delay perception. But i'm really out on a limb here as this is so hard 
to measure directly.)

a good number of testers use it because it improves interactiveness - so 
you'll see these arguments come up.
One indirect latency effect is that during heavier VM load, e.g. kswapd 
(or the swapout code) is preemptable by X.
Another indirect effect is that in the stock kernel, interrupt work is 
not preemptable. So a short succession of heavier interrupts, followed 
by softirq processing, can very much cause more than 10 msec delays.  
Under PREEMPT_RT (or just PREEMPT + softirq and hardirq threading) these 
workloads are much more controlled. (at the price of significant IRQ 
processing overhead, which should not be ignored either.)
but ... i agree that this argument in isolation cannot "win". It's the 
sum of arguments that matters.
