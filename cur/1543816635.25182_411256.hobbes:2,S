No, it was discussed on redhat-lspp and linux-audit.

I raised the same concern in Dec (subj: audit patches in -mm that alter
current SELinux behavior), but concluded that falling through to
selinux_getsecurity() in all cases does no harm and the real cost here
is in the generation of the context string, so we don't save much by the
shortcut that was removed above.
