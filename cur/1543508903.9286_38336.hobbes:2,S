Mike,
Another Sony ATAPI CD-R model, CDU928E, supports only WRITE12
rather than WRITE10 commands. Since in the log below your drive
returns "illegal request" for WRITE10, I suspect that your model
probably doesn't support WRITE10 as well.
In the cdrecord source, in drv_mmc.c, there is something like:
        if (strncmp(ip->vendor_info, "SONY", 4) == 0 &&
            strncmp(ip->prod_ident, "CD-R   CDU928E", 14) == 0) {
                dp = &cdr_mmc_sony;
        } 
Try to use cdr_mmc_sony for your model as well, and perhaps it
will solve the problem.
