A new elevator was introduced into 2.2.16, that may be affecting
results. Try using elvtune from util-linux to set read_latency,
write_latency, and max_bomb_segments much higher and see if that brings
it back to 2.2.15 levels. (hint: use something big, like 10000000
for read/write latency, and 128 for max_bomb_segments).
