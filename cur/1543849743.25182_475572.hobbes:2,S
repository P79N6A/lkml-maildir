Note that the way spufs does it, every directory is a reference-counted
object. Currently that includes single contexts and groups of
contexts that are supposed to be scheduled simultaneously.
The trick is that we use the special 'spu_create' syscall to
add a new object, while naming it, and return an open file
descriptor to it. When that file descriptor gets closed, the
object gets garbage-collected automatically.
This way you can simply kill a task, which also cleans up
all the special objects it allocated.
We ended up adding a lot more file than we initially planned,
but the interface is really handy, especially if you want to
create some procps-like tools for it.

Have you thought about simply defining your guest to be a section
of the processes virtual address space? That way you could use
an anonymous mapping in the host as your guest address space, or
even use a file backed mapping in order to make the state persistant
over multiple runs. Or you could map the guest kernel into the
guest real address space with a private mapping and share the
text segment over multiple guests to save L2 and RAM.

I'd recommend not allowing mkdir or similar operations, although
it's not that far off. One option would be to let the user specify
the number of CPUs at kvm_create() time, another option might
be to allow kvm_create with a special flag or yet another syscall
to create the vcpu objects.

We've gone through a number of iterations on the spufs design regarding this,
and in the end decided that the garbage-collecting property of spu_create
was superior to any other option, and adding the spu_run syscall was then
the logical step. BTW, one inspiration for spu_run came from sys_vm86, which
as you are probably aware of is already doing a lot of what you do, just
not for protected mode guests.
