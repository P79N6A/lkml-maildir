Uh, do I trust Linus ? ;-) Well, probably I am going to take a look. The whole
story eats a lot of time as I have to deal with GBs of data for every single
test.

Can you clarify? Do you mean options "nosmp noapic" or just "noapic" on SMP
kernel?

Hm, my question is: if it were exclusively an apic problem, why do other
controllers (in a filesystem environment) work flawlessly. Maybe the driver and
apic simply have differing opinions in certain race cases, but that does not
mean that apic is always to blame, does it?
