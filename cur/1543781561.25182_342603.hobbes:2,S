Ok, no problem. I was just thinking today about all the issues that were

Ok, I wasn't sure about that -- I'm not too familiar with the itimer
code (maybe I'll take a look at it soon :) )

I don't want to be too parental either, but I also am trying to avoid
code duplication. Lots of drivers basically do something like
poll_event() does (or could do with some changes), i.e. looping a
constant amount multiple times, checking something every so often. The
patch was just a thought, though. I will keep evaluating drivers and see
if it's a useful interface to have eventually.
I guess I'm just concerned with making an unintuitive interface. As was
brought up at OLS, drivers are a major source of bugs/buggy code. The
simpler, more useful we can make interfaces, the better, I think. I'm
not claiming you disagree, I just want to make my own motives clear.
While fixing up the schedule_timeout() comment would make it clear what
schedule_timeout() achieves, I'm not sure how useful such an interface
is, if every caller adds 1 :) I need to mull it over, though... Lots to
consider. I also, of course, want to stay flexible for the reasons you
mention (letting the driver adjust the timeout as they expect to).
Thanks,
Nish
