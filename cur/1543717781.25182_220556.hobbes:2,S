The change my newbie eye sees here is that the effect of CONFIG_ACPI=y
changes from imperceptible in 2.6.6 to kernel won't boot in 2.6.6-bk1.
> Does 2.6.6 work for you?
2.6.6 works for me, yes, as did 2.6.5, 2.6.4, etc. ...
$ grep 'CONFIG_ACPI=' .config
CONFIG_ACPI=y
$ grep 'ACPI.*=y$' .config | grep -v '^#' | wc -l
     16
$
The motherboard labels in front of me include:
"INTEL DESKTOP BOARD"
"D865GBF/D865PERC".

Thanks for making the time to say I was unclear.
In launching a thread titled "oops ACPI" I was guessing that lossy dmesg
spew appearing immediately past "ACPI: Subsystem revision 20040326" was
caused by me living too close to `make defconfig`.  I then revisited
`make xconfig`, asked to turn off ACPI, and suddenly life got better.
I'm working from local copies of the kernel.org files:
$ ls -l *2.6.6*
-rw-rw-r--    1 pat      pat      34896138 May 10 11:14 linux-2.6.6.tar.bz2
-rw-------    1 pat      pat       1072216 May 12 08:47 patch-2.6.6-bk1.bz2
$
I can fsck the containing volume, but I haven't yet otherwise learned
how to crc-check their integrity.
