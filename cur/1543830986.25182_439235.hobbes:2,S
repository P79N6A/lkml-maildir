Oh, yes. Dump is synchronous. So it won't be useful unless we buffer 
task exit records within
taskstats.

The rates (or upper bounds) that are being discussed here, as of now, 
are 1000 exits/sec/CPU for
1024 CPU systems. That would be roughly 1M exits/system * 
248Bytes/message  = 248 MB/sec.

Hmm. So we could buffer the per-task exit data within taskstats (the mem 
consumption would grow
but thats probably not a problem) and then send it out later.
Jay - would not getting exit data soon after exit be a problem for CSA ? 
I'm guessing not, if the
timeout is kept small enough. Internally, taskstats could always pace 
its sends so that "too much"
isn't sent out at one shot.
