I think you've got something!  I managed to provoke failure from 3 of
the 5 interfaces in a single burst of reset clicking!  And yes, all 3
failed interfaces are on the Indigita card, and no, the Fireboard has
never failed.
The last thing I see from the failed interfaces is this:
Nov 27 08:25:51 spanky kernel: ohci1394: fw-host3: PhyReqFilter=0000000000000000
Nov 27 08:25:51 spanky kernel: ohci1394: fw-host3: IntEventClear
00000000 IntEventSet 6ffdc33f IntMaskSet 00000000
which looks very different from the entries by the interfaces that
survive (these are the lines immediately before the one above)
Nov 27 08:25:51 spanky kernel: ohci1394: fw-host4: IntEventClear
00000000 IntEventSet 04508000 IntMaskSet 818300f3

I'm not sure if this says anything to you except "hey, don't use those
Indigita cards".  The problem is, I can't get the number of ports I
need using only Fireboards (I think I need 6, and I have 5 PCI slots
but need to use some of the other slots).
Is there further diagnostic poking about that I can do to narrow down
the problem?   Is something for Indigita?  The card is pretty basic: 4
of the TI TSB82AA2 (Ice Lynx) links behind a IBM/Tundra PCI-X bridge.
I have an Intel quad ethernet card that uses the exact same part
(well, one rev older, actually).  Here's a chunk of my lspci for
completeness sake:
01:04.0 PCI bridge: IBM PCI-X to PCI-X Bridge (rev 03)
01:06.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments TSB82AA2 IEEE-1394b
Link Layer Controller (rev 01)
02:04.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments TSB82AA2 IEEE-1394b
Link Layer Controller (rev 01)
02:05.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments TSB82AA2 IEEE-1394b
Link Layer Controller (rev 01)
02:06.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments TSB82AA2 IEEE-1394b
Link Layer Controller (rev 01)
02:07.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments TSB82AA2 IEEE-1394b
Link Layer Controller (rev 01)
I will also try cramming a machine full of Fireboards and seeing if I
can't get one of them to fail.
