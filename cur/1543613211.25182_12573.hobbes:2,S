Subject: USB not processing APM suspend event properly?

The following syslog fragment shows what happens when I
suspended a while ago.  The USB subsystem disconnected
my USB mouse, but then tried (twice) to reconnect it again
while the apm driver was still processing the suspend.  The
attempts to reconnect failed.  I presume there is something
wrong with this picture.  Does this indicate a bug in
USB power management?
(The repeated "received system suspend notify" messages are
there because I have apm debug messages switch on, and I
am using a ThinkPad, which generates repeated suspend
events.)
