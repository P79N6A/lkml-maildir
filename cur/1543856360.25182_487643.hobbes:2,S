Subject: proposed patch:  standardize white space for "#endif /* __KERNEL__ */" directives
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  i've got a one-line perl command that runs through include/linux and
standardizes all of the "#endif" directives for "__KERNEL__" into a
single variant
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */
where all of the whitespace bits above are a single space and nothing
more.
  while this is clearly just aesthetic and involves only whitespace
transformation, it was handy when i was messing around with what
happened during "make headers_install" as i was trying to match the
opening and closing __KERNEL__ directives, and i had to accommodate
that some of those #endif directives had a space, and others a tab, or
multiple spaces, or multiple tabs, etc.  grrrrrrrrrr.
  is it worth submitting this kind of whitespace-related patch?
obviously, it can be done for the entire tree (perhaps in a multi-part
patch) or just include/linux where i was using it.
  if that goes in, a follow-up patch would add any missing __KERNEL__
comments to the corresponding #endif directives so that, visually, it
would be far easier to see the nesting.
  thoughts?  or a waste of time?

p.s.  there is the occasional
#endif    // __KERNEL__
directive as well, but that's obviously just as easy to handle.
