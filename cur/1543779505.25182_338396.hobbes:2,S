Yes, please CC the LKML.  I try to for all updates since I might have
done a mistake in my code that my shallow tests don't catch, and others
might. Also to let others know what I'm suggesting to Ingo so they may
comment as well. I've had some pretty good comments from people, as well
as just deeper thoughts in what's being changed.  I also try to see
what's being proposed to Ingo's patch to make sure that I understand
what my code will be depending on.
Your wakeup race patch is a perfect example of something that should
definitely be CC'd to LKML.
