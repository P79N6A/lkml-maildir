When CIFS is built-in (=y) and staging/rt28[67]0 =y, there are multiple
definitions of:
build-r8250.out:(.text+0x1d8ad0): multiple definition of `MD5Init'
build-r8250.out:(.text+0x1dbb30): multiple definition of `MD5Update'
build-r8250.out:(.text+0x1db9b0): multiple definition of `MD5Final'
all of which need to have more unique identifiers for their global
symbols (e.g., rt28_md5_init, cifs_md5_init, foo, blah, bar).
