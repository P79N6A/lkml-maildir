Oops.  I defer to your experience.  I didn't notice that much wrong with
it, but definitely something that looked like lagging refreshes - I
described it in more detail in the previous message.
The important parts of the code need reworking to fit in with subsequent
changes.  I'm up for that, but I may need some help in terms of
maintaining good taste; the NV_ARCH_30 case may need to be separated out
a little more than it is at the moment.  I'll post again when I have
something working right.
I owe you an apology; I could not expect you to reply to my query about
the vpllB stuff immediately, and I should have waited until you had.
Also, given that we both tried this on the GeForce FX 5200, and the
single FX card supported under 2.6.11 is a the Mac version of the
GeForce FX GO 5200, it might be a good idea to limit the cards to the
5200 series for the time being.
Yours apologetically,
Alan
