I'm basically ignoring all the containers/resource-control stuff, waiting
for it to appear to have settled down.  It's quite unclear which patches
are at the RFC stage and which are at the ready-to-go stage.
If you guys could gather and maintain the acked-by's and make it clear what
the maturity level is on each patch series it would help, thanks.
