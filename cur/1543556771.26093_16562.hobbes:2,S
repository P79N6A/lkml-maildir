Interesting. One of my ports references for PCs lists
0044    r/w     PIT  counter 3 (PS/2, EISA)
                used as fail-safe timer. generates an NMI on time out.
                for user generated NMI see at 0462.
I don't know if modern PCs still provide this counter, but if yes it could
be used for a slow NMI watchdog that only runs every 30s or so.
