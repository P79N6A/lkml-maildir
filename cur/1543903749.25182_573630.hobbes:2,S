Heh.  Well, my definition of "good enough" is enough so that the C/H/S
fields are sane so that the BIOS can boot the system.  So I don't care
about grabbing things verbatim since my higher priority is stuffing as
much data for as many partitions as possible into 512 bytes.  Things
that require grabbing the C/H/S fields verbatim to avoid breakage I
would classify as "broken software".  But, your mileage may vary.  :-)

This assumes that the extended partition is at the beginning of the
disk, yes?  Why would anyone do that?  I normally have /dev/hda1 at
the beginning of the disk, and I normally make /dev/hda4 my extended,
and place it *after* partitions at /dev/hda2, /dev/hda3, etc.

It would be interesting to see how badly modern Windows systems breaks
on this.  If Windows 2000 and above works, and Linux works, then if
other things break it might be quite sufficient to consider them
"broken software" that we don't need to worry about.

Well, in about 2-3 years or so we'll seeing having singleton disks
bigger 2TB.  I'm not terribly sanguine about BIOS vendors and OS
providers migrating to something better by then, alas.  Life is sure
going to be interesting.  :-)
