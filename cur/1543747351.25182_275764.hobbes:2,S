If you plan on partitioning system memory into none-fuse and fuse 
memory, yes, that could work. but it's horribly inflexible - right now 
memory is balanced dynamically according to actual use. you may also 
have a hard time with mmap.
my proposal (with the per-process allocation thredsholds) only reserves 
a small amount of memory to the fuse(s), with the rest allocated 
dynamically using the normal kernel policies, with no special 
restrictions on fuse.
