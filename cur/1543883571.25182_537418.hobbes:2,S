Plus it has the very user-friendly reportbug and querybts
commandline interfaces. No going to web pages to query
bugs, and you can just download the email thread for
a bug report as an mbox file and then reply via email.
(Querybts currently only works if you know the package
name, it can't search across all packages so it wouldn't
be that useful for the kernel. But for Debian packages
this tool is gold.)
