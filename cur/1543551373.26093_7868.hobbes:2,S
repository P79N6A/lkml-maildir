The good news is that "read" does use stdio (along with seek and print).
The syscall ones are sys{read,write,seek}. The less good news is that
your "print OUT <STDIN>" sucks up all the RPM file into memory before
dumping it out again which is inelegant and leads those who copy the
idiom without understanding it to run into problems when they use
similar code on large files. One way of doing it a bit differently is
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    die "Usage: rpm2cpio foo.rpm | cpio ...\n" unless @ARGV == 1;
    open(RPM, $ARGV[0]) or die "$ARGV[0]: $!\n";
    open(STDOUT, "| gunzip") or die "cannot find gunzip: $!\n";
    while (read(RPM, $_, 8192)) {
	if (!$found_gzmagic) {
	    s/^.*?(?=\037\213)//s or next;
	    $found_gzmagic = 1;
	}
	print;
    }

Oops, yes, we now return you to your regularly scheduled kgcc wars.
