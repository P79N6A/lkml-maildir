Well, the basic SX4 SATA driver is pretty much done.  There is one 
bugfix I need to merge for PCI-X, but that's it.
Unfortunately, it is a bit slower than average since every request must 
bounce through RAM first, with no queueing.
Using the on-board DIMM as a write-through cache would boost performance 
significantly.

Well, the specs are under NDA but are available from Promise.
However...  if you want to tackle creating the write-through cache, that 
shouldn't require any specs at all.  If you are knowledgeable enough to 
create generic write-through cache code for an ATA drive, that's 
sufficient :)
