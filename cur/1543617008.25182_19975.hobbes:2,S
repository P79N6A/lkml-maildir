We can use both:
     destroy MSDOS superblock (if any) at mkreiserfs (or don't touch 1st block of the device if there is no
     msdos superblock).
     And link reiserfs code into the kernel earlier than msdos code is linked in.
This second way is for those poor souls who ran mkreiserfs on top of their FAT partitions before
we released new mkreiserfs that can destroy FAT superblocks.

Changing of linking order will fix that, too.
