Note that IL has no flow control. You may not think you need flow
control, but the minute you have several people talking to 1 at high
speed, life gets interesting. A group I used to work for (Legion) had
its own IL-like protocol, and we finally decided that TCP's flow
control was a huge win locally (our Legion-MPI programs were
overrunning the 64k OS buffers), and TCP's adaptive stuff was far
superior over WANs.
On the other hand, it's pretty trivial to pass whole messages over TCP.
