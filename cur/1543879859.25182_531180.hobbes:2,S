Is it?
patch:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/27/225
test result:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/31/41
If so, yes. That patch has some dispersion.

You are welcome. I can use larger machine by chance, and also tested
there just now.
Test environment
================
 - kernel:         2.6.21-rc6-CFS
 - run time:       300 secs
 - # of CPU:       12
 - # of processes: 200 or 2400
Result
===================================
  +----------+-----------+-------+------+------+--------+
  |   # of   |   # of    | avg   | max  | min  |  stdev |
  |   CPUs   | processes |       |      |      |        |
  +----------+-----------+-------+------+------+--------+
  |          |       200 |  2250 | 2348 | 2204 |     64 |
  | 12(ia64) +-----------+-------+------+------+--------+
  |          |      2400 | 187.5 |  197 |  176 |    4.3 |
  +----------+-----------+-------+------+------+--------+
Looks like good too.
BTW, I've a question. Actually this problem is fixed on CFS and DS. However
they are mostly written from scratch and doeesn't suitable for stable version,
for example 2.6.20.X. Can your other patch be compromise for stable version?
Although that patch is not perfect, but I think it's preferable to leave it
alone.
