Sorry, missed this on the first reading - yes, there are reasons
for doing this per inode, as Jan points out...

Such a change would would indeed break XFS, in exactly the way you
suggest Jan - the realtime subvolume does typically use a different
blocksize from the data subvolume (the realtime extent size is used,
and this can be set per-inode too), and there would now be no way to
distinguish this preferred IO size difference.
cheers.
