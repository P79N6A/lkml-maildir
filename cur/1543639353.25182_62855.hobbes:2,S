The current large-page patch doesn't have any kind of defragmentation in the 
special zone and that memory is just not available for other uses.  The thing 
is, when demand for large pages is low the zone should be allowed to fragment.
All of highmem also qualifies as defraggable memory, so certainly on these 
big memory machines we can easily get a majority of memory in large pages.
I don't see a fundamental reason for new zone balancing problems.  The fact 
that balancing has sucked by tradition is not a fundamental reason ;-)
