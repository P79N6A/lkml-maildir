Isn't that part of the patch overkill?
As I understand things, del_timer() must acquire the timerlist_lock
spinlock to modify the timer list. I guess that all other code
(including the code in bottom half handlers) that want to modify the
timer list do the same.
So why do we need to use [start|end]_bh_atomic() to guarantee that no
BH on any CPU will execute while we modify the timer list?
Best regards,
