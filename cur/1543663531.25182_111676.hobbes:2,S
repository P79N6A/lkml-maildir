Scalability done properly should not degrade performance on smaller
machines, Pee Cees, or even microscopic organisms.

There's quite a bit of commonality with large x86 highmem there, as
the highmem crew is extremely concerned about the kernel's memory
footprint and is looking to trim kernel memory overhead from every
aspect of its operation they can. Reducing kernel memory footprint
is a crucial part of scalability, in both scaling down to the low end
and scaling up to highmem. =)
