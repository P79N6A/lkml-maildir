Hi Fengguang,
 Yeah, that pretty much describes the situation we end up. Although
"sluggish" is much to friendly if we hit the situation :-)
 Yes, I am very interested  to check out your patch. I saw your
postings on LKML already and was already curious. Any chance you have
something agains 2.6.22-stable? I have reasons not to move to -23 or
-mm.

 Ahh. Yes, they go up to 80-90k pages. Comparable to the nr_dirty
numbers for the disk case. Good to know.
 For NFS, the nr_writeback numbers seem surprisingly high. They also go
to 80-90k (pages ?). In the disk case they rarely go over 12k.
