Hello,
I am trying to the user HW debug registers on i386
and I am running into a problem with ptrace() not allowing access
to EFLAGS_RF for POKEUSER (see FLAG_MASK).
I am not sure I understand the motivation for denying access
to this flag which can be used to resume after a code
breakpoint has been reached. It avoids the need to remove the
breakpoint, single step, and reinstall. The equivalent
functionality exists on IA-64 and is allowed by ptrace().
Why is EFLAGS_RF not accessible to users on i386?
Thanks.
