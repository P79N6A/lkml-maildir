If you make the root file-system, or any part of it, a module, then
the module must be loaded before the kernel attempts to mount the
root file-system. This is normally done using `initrd`. You need to
find out how to reconfigure `initrd` to handle your changes. This
varies between vendors and has nothing to do with the kernel. In
fact, when you see the message about being unable to mount the root
file-system, it means that the kernel was running fine but ran out
of things to do on startup because somebody, probably you, failed to
provide an available file-system to mount so it could continue the
startup by executing `init`.
