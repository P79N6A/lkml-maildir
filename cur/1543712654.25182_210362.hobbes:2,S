No, but hopefully sched domains balancing will do
better than the old numasched.

It is the same situation with all NUMA, obviously Opteron's
1 CPU per node means it is sensitive to node imbalances.

Well it seems like Ingo is on to something. Phew! :)

Not really sure. I guess probably most things that use a
lot of threads, maybe java, a web server using per connection
threads (if there is such a thing).
On the other hand though, maybe it will be a good idea if it
is done carefully...
