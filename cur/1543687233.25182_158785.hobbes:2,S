(trimming down a bit)

default via 128.173.12.1 dev eth3 
eth1 is an 11mbit wireless on a fairly loaded net, eth3 is a 100mbit line.
If I try 'ip ro add default dev eth1 metric 1 via 198.82.168.1', things
actually work As Expected - if I'm in the docking station, traffic goes via
eth3 because it's lower cost, if I'm wandering it goes via wireless.
Until I fall out of the 128.173.12.1 ARP cache, it ARPS for my eth3 address,
and my laptop gratuitously answers via eth1 - and since that isn't even the
same router, it doesn't listen.  Meanwhile, my laptop *doesnt* fall over to
using wireless because it still has a lower-cost default route for the 100mbit
side (and even if it did, any existing connections would still be hosed).
I can't believe I need to go beat my kernel over the head with 'arpfilter' or
other crap just to get 2 interfaces to each reliably say "here I am" on their
own damned subnet, not the OTHER subnet where nobody gives a rat's posterior
about the other interface....
