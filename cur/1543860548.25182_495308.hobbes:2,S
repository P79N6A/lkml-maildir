I was able to achieve a temporary work around by manipulating 'struct
file' directly. This fixed things enough so that I could load the
driver and check it out. zd1211 wireless is a case where we have the
vendor supplying and supporting a GPL driver based on 2.6.9 that is
300K and not very integrated into the networking code.  Then there is
the zd1211rw project, 85K, which is in the kernel source and is a
rework of the vendor code by non-vendor developers, It is integrated
with the Linux networking internals.
The problem is that the vendor driver can do some things that the
zd1211rw version can't. I'm trying to figure out why some things are
working the vendor driver that fail in zd1211rw.
