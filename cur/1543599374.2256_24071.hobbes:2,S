I tried the visor first, and saw this behavior.  (without even insmoding
the usb-storage driver)  I tried it several times, with the same
results.  Only this morning before sending my message did I try the
usb-storage to see if it was broken too.
I've rmmod'ed everything and re-insmoded everything (except usb-storage)
with the same results.
Maybe related:
Why would /proc/bus/usb be always empty?
I'll reboot to 2.4.7 again when I get home tonight and try it.
Cheers,
