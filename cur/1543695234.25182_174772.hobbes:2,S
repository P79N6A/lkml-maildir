Not quite always ... this was how I found the efi trim.bottom bug, since
Linux had allocated a pgd at 0xa00000-16k, and the lfetch that reached
out beyond the end of the page to the uncacheable address 0xa00000 took
an MCA.
A pgd in the last page of a granule that is followed by an uncacheable
address would do the same with lfetch.fault, wouldn't it?
