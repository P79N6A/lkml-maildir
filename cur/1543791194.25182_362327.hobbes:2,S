No, don't take the code without the suppliers permission.  It contains 
trade secrets and you can get into a ot of trouble if there's an 
agreement between the two of you.  Contact the supplier.  Tell them to 
abstract away thre kernel headers, or rewrite to remove them, or grant 
you persmission to open source the driver.  The UK is the land of 
frivilous lawsuits (I should know a lot about this :-)  ), so don;t 
expose yourself and breach any agreements.
