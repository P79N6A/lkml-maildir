Input devices names are not guaranteed to be stable, they get them in
order of their registration and therefore can change based on config,
order in which modules are loaded and changes in other modules. In
this case shift was caused by scroll support recently added to atkbd.
Ideally hotplug system should notify interested parties about current
layout, but for programs that do not support dynamic setup changes
please use mice multiplexor device (/dev/input/mice) that gives access
to data from _all_ mouse-like devices in the system.
Hope that helps.
