ok, I have read everything and also have read the chapters about
tty_drivers. However I'm not really understand, how to ... .
I will summarize the concrete scenario, which will lead to the
understanding and further solution of deadling with serial driver.
[scenario]
	1. in userspace I'm doing: > date > /dev/ttyS0
	2. in kernelspace I want to print out this date.
[/scenario]
I'm really new to kernel coding, that's why I maybe understand some
functions not the proper way.
I'm a bit confused.
