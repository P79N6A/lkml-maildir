Fsck, Fsck, Fsck, Fsck, It happened again.  
Mar 27 02:47:05 reliant kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
Mar 27 02:47:05 reliant kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
Mar 27 02:48:45 reliant last message repeated 2 times
Mar 27 03:53:40 reliant kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
That's with the password included in the command line.
Here's what's currently mounted:
root:reliant lib$ mount
/dev/sda1 on / type ext2 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
/dev/sda3 on /home type ext2 (rw)
/dev/sda2 on /usr/local type ext2 (rw)
//WINNT/C$ on /home/me2v/mounts type smbfs (0)
//WINNT/ME2V on /home/me2v/winnt type smbfs (0)
/dev/scd0 on /mnt/cdrom type iso9660 (ro)
and you have to be root to umount the shares when this happens too:
me2v:reliant me2v$ smbumount mounts 
Could not open mounts: Input/output error
root:reliant lib$ umount /home/me2v/mounts 
root:reliant lib$ 
gAR!!
