Goes back to the question: why should 
all filesystems be forced to look like Ext2?
If you want to kludge a non-ext2 filesystem
onto ext2, you can use ".LinuxDouble" directories
as several people have suggested. But it's just
a hack -- and one that pollutes the namespace and
can lead to orphaned files.

Who says that netatalk has to stop doing what it's doing?
Conversely, why must HFS convert to Ext2-palatable format,
and then netatalk do the inverse? Isn't that just a lot
of extra busy work?

Yuck! What if Ext2 didn't delete a percentage 
of its files until a nightly cron job ran?

mmm... institutionalizing filesystem corruption.
