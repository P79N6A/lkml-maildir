The patch itself looks ok, but I am wondering what is
the difference between your ac97_restore_state and ac97_reset.
I think you may be reinventing the wheel here.
I cannot test the patch because my suspend/resume cycle
retains mixer levels without it (2.2.14 stock, PCG-Z505JE),
so I would not see any difference.
