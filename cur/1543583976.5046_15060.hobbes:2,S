We won't--without getting into the specifics (NDA) we are developing a
TCP/IP load balance tester that needs to act--similtaneously--as many
machines. It is certainly not designed to run on your average LAN, but
rather on a carefully prepared test network using data assigned by a
user who (presumably) has ensured the IPs we are using are not already
assigned to other machines.

We have hacks in place for promiscous ARPing on any of the IPs we may
want to use :)
So, if I configure the interface as suggested ("/sbin/ip addr add
10.0.0.0/24 dev eth0") can I really bind to any IP in 10.0.0.0/24 and
conduct TCP sessions (as a client or server) using that IP--assuming all
the ARP, etc, issues are worked out?
Regards,
Bryan
