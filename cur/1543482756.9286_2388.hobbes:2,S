Hi!
I have a PC running happily 2.0.36.
I tried 2.2.0, it compiled fine, but I can not connect to my
network any longer. I have upgraded to net-tools 1.49.
On 2.2.0 I can not reach anybody outside the network, while on
2.0.36 (with exactly the same init - simply rebooting into a different
kernel) everything works fine.
I have no clue where to look. Did something obvious change in the
network/routing initialisation?
One clue I got: 2.0.36 /proc/net/route gives

        MTU     Window  IRTT

which looks reasonable to me (what do I know?),
while 2.2.0 /proc/net/route gives

Paper bag time? What manual to read? This machine is an old, heavily patched
SuSE 4.4, so some prehistoric setup things might bite now.
