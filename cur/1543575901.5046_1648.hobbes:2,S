Hi all,
I have an application in which it would be useful to have access to
remote serial ports as if they where local ports. 
Machine A has several serial ports on it connected to various
special types of devices in a locked machine room.
Developers on workstation B wants to execute an application that
communicates with the special devices, but can only do so via
/dev/ttySXX. The developer however (for various reasons) cannot
directly log into Machine A.
Is there some software that would allow "remote forwarding" of
serial ports? I.e. a driver that emulates a serial port on
machine B and forwards the read/write/ioctl operations to machine A?
Does this exist? Is it possible to implement if it doesn't?
Am I overlooking something obvious?
Thank you in advance,
Jens Petersohn
