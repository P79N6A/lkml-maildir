Wrong way around - you need to let people turn it on. Perhaps distribute
it with the kernel so you can 
		make register
		[Reports hardware, stashed a unique sha-1 hashed cookie]
		[Asks for permission, installs UDP ping daemon]
		make unregister
but it would have to be opt in. That might lower coverage but should
increase quality, especially id the id in the cookie can be put into
bugzilla reports, and the hardware reporting is done so it can be
machine processed (ie so you can ask stuff like 'reliability with Nvidia
IDE')
