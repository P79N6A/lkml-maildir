It seems the real gain (in latency) is caused by the FIFO behaviour.
That is, removing this hunk (against __get_request_wait())
-               if (q->rq[rw].count < batch_requests)
+               if (q->rq[rw].count == 0)
                        schedule();
Would not make _much_ difference latency-wise. I'm I right or missing
something ?
Anyway, I would like to have the patch cleaned up for 2.4.19-pre (remove
the instrumentation stuff _and_ make it clear on the documentation that
READA requests are not being used in practice).
Thanks a lot for that, Andrew.
