I suggest that you prune linux/config.h and autoconf.h from all graphs.
The dependency system does not depend directly on those files, instead
it depends on individual config options.
It makes more sense to list the individual config options that an
include file depends on, see the code in scripts/mkdep.c.  Even then it
would be better to suppress the config options by default and only list
them when requested.
