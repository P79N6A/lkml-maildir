I always thought it was really strange that I couldn't open() a AF_UNIX
socket in order to write() to it (as a stream socket, of course.)  It
really makes a lot of things harder to do than it needs to be, and I
would still like to see this generalization done.
That being said, if USB exported a filesystem I don't see any good reason
why you shouldn't be able to advertise "socket" (S_ISSOCK()) objects and
simply have them accept open("/dev/usb/blah/blah") instead of
connect(AF_USB, ...) -- and still use send() and recv() where it is more
appropriate to do so than using read() and write().
