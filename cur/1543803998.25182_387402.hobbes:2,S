alternative is to just use any compiler that came with a distro, and is
at least of 3.2 vintage. (the 3.3 thing is mostly for arm; 3.2 on arm
seemed to not have been a good thing). Distros usually put in fixes to
gcc that are from higher/later versions, eg gcc.gnu.org releases
sometimes have a few bad bugs at release time that will get fixed later,
while the distros put those fixes in immediately.
