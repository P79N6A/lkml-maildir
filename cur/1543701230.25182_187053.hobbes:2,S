Has anyone tried SuSE 9.0 (I believe the feature also exists in 8.2)?
It has a program called suseplugger that monitors hotswappable devices.
When I stick my USB key in it automatically detects and mounts the device
and presents an icon in KDE. It is very smooth and elegant, even more so
than in windows which pops up a bunch of "New Hardware Found" dialogs
each time you plug it into a different USB port for the first time. Also,
I unplugged the device a few times without unmounting it and there were
no complaints. In fact, I plugged it in again and was able to access the
files without having to remount it, Linux thought it was mounted the whole
time.
But I agree, OT, this is an interface issue.
