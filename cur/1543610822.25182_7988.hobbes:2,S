umm..  I've never seen any numbers from you, David.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the pagecache_hash cost is
significant in the following situations:
1: TUX, because its pagecache lookups are not associated with
   a page copy.  This copy makes the benefits of the patch
   unmeasurable with other workloads.
1a: Other sendfile-intensive applications. (Theoretical benefit.
    No benchmark results have been seen).
2: NUMA hardware, where the cost of cacheline transfer is much
   higher.
ergo, there is no point in futzing with the pagecache_lock *at all*
until either TUX is merged, or we decide to support large-scale
NUMA hardware well, which will require changes in other places.
Prove me wrong.  Please.
