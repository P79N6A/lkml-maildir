I managed to do a few quick tests yesterday of voluntary Q3:
SMP kernel on UP machine (Athlon64): hangs during boot, goes a little
further than before but hangs anyway:
requesting new irq thread for IRQ169
ata1: dev 0 ATA, max UDMA/133 ...
IRQ#169 thread started up
ata1: dev 0 configured for UDMA/133 ...
scsi0: sata_promise
ata2: dev 0 ATA ...
  --- hangs ---
SMP kernel on SMP machine (dual Athlon):
softirq-preempt=0 hardirq-preempt=0 acpi=on: hangs
  afaik hang happens when something needs interrupts, first culprit in
  my machine is eth0, if I disable it I can go further ahead and boot
  but alsa has timeouts, presumably because it is not getting
  interrupts.
softirq-preempt=0 hardirq-preempt=0 acpi=off: boots normally, 
  jack, glxgears work fine (but high latency spikes)
softirq-preempt=1 hardirq-preempt=1 acpi=off: boots normally,
  jack works fine, glxgears hangs machine after a while
Sorry I was not able to check all permutations, I was late and stopped
rebooting the machine :-) I think I did one more test with sort=1,
hard=1, acpi=off and did not manage to hang the machine.
