it seems that your boot loader is not supplying the kernel with the boot params
properly as can be seen from the excerpt below:
...
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=linux_2.6.25rc2 ro root=900 md=0,/dev/sda5,/dev/sdb5 hda=noprobe
Parsing ARGS: BOOT_IMAGE=linux_2.6.25rc2 ro root=900 md=0,/dev/sda5,/dev/sdb5 hda=noprobe
Unknown argument: calling c03670ce
Unknown argument: calling c03670ce
Unknown argument: calling c03670ce
Unknown argument: calling c03670ce
md: Will configure md0 (super-block) from /dev/sda5,/dev/sdb5, below.
Unknown argument: calling c03670ce
...
and, as a result, the probing of hda still takes place.

Bart, can we assume here that some of the nic interrupts somehow get handled by
ide-cd or something gets mixed up there?
