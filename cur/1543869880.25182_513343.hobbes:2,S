None.  Each schedulable entity (whether a fully fledged
CPU core or an SMT/HT thread) is treated the same.

Not really, that would make it impossible for MySQL to
handle more simultaneous database queries than the system
has CPUs.
Besides, it looks like this is not a problem in MySQL
per se (it works on FreeBSD) but some bug in Linux.
