Subject: [PATCH] mpspec.h: Fix MAX_MP_BUSSES for compliance with MP specification
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

MP specification uses an 8-bit field for bus ID.  Therefore, the highest bus ID is 0xff.
Since the tables allocated and used in mpparse.c are indexed by bus ID, we need to make
sure we allocate 256 entries for these tables.
Note that bus IDs can be noncontiguous, according to the MP specification.  The only
requirement is that they be listed in increasing order.
