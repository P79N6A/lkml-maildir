Ross,
    I thought of that to, I just have 2 laptops that are identical here 
now. I have placed a different drive in the other one. So we can test 
it, but looking through all my logs that I backed up, this problem 
started when I put 2.6.8 on the laptop. I'm wondering if it could be an 
ACPI issue or IDE issue, but have no idea on what to really look for.
