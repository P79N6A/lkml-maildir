Hi,
Know it's worst about this.
I have an amd64, on a asrock 939 Dual Sata mother board, and the onbard
network is an ULi526x one.
Know, just ifconfig makes the switch led to blink, and no possibility to
dhclient: I never get ip address from the DHCP server.
I tried with 2.6.16 kernels. Nothing about uli526x file/stuff in the
2.6.17, so it should be OK.
What would you sugest to do?
