Is it correct behavoir to have the following:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        255020     252688       2332          0       3012      99264
-/+ buffers/cache:     150412     104608
Swap:       112412     112412          0
I understand that in many situation it is an advantage to keep things in
the file cache and instead of using that memory for new things, swap out
parts of other processes.  But isn't this alittle extreme?
