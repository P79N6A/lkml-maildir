I thought about that before I posted the previous patch, but
rejected it.
If it worked in all situations then it would have been great,
but it fails in at least one way [*1*], so you cannot generally
define the above in a header file which everybody includes.
Instead, you end up examining each use of strlen() and make the
above "#define" only where it does not break; it is not worth
the aggravation.  Something named "strlen" must work in all
situations, and "in this situation" is not good enough.
Otherwise it would confuse/surprise people.
[Footnotes]
*1*  It fails on the following:
#define FOOBARBAZ &("foobarbaz"[0])
void
main(void) {
  int sz;
  if (__builtin_constant_p(FOOBARBAZ)) {
    sz = sizeof(FOOBARBAZ) - 1;
    printf("sizeof(FOOBARBAZ) -1 = %d\n", sz);
  }
  printf("strlen(FOOBARBAZ) = %d\n", strlen(FOOBARBAZ));
  exit(0);
}
