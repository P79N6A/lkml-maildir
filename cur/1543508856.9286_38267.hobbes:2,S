I agree with you. But I have tcpdump running on both machines, the local
and the remote host, and I have the same packet lost an both machines.
So... BPF samples the packets before they hit the ethernet on the local
machine, isn't that right? And therefore, tcpdump on the local machine
should show all packets (providing that BPF doesn't lose packets, what
is not the case here).
Can you please comment on this. Thank you.
