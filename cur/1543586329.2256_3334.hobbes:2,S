This really looks like you bus is not up to snuff.  We timeout during
a write to the drive.  Although the chip has data to write, the target
has stopped asking for data.  This is a classic symptom of a lost signal
transition on the bus.  The old driver may have worked in the past
because it was not quite as fast at driving the bus.  2.2.19 uses the
"old" aic7xxx driver but includes some performance improvements over 2.2.18.
The new driver has similar improvements.  Check your cables.  Check
your terminators.  Etc.
