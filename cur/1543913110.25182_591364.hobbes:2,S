The only warning that I was able to trigger with gcc 4.2 is in the case of a .config
without PCI support. In this case I get
drivers/net/3c59x.c: In function 'vortex_up':
drivers/net/3c59x.c:1672: warning: 'err' is used uninitialized in this function
                                         ^^
So we have to be more carefull with the newer gcc versions.
