I'm online again.  I had fun getting caught in the trailing edge of a blizzard
in Nebraska earlier but I have found my way back to my apartment and my computer 
and friends.
Jeff Garzik is the one who really spotted what the problem is.  He pointed
out that pci_save_state and pci_restore_state have not historically required
being paired (as the usually are during suspend and resume) and there is
a practical use in resetting devices for not requiring them to be paired.
The recent additions to pci_save_state and pci_restore_state for the msi,
pci-e, pci-x all assumed those calls would be paired, and thus allocated
a buffer on save and freed the buffer and restore.
My WARN_ON's tested to ensure all of the buffers were freed.
However drivers like the tg3 that use pci_save/restore_state for more than
just suspend/resume wind up triggering the warning.
I have recently sent out two patches to remove the pairing requirement
but I haven't figured out suspend/resume for any of my machines so I
couldn't test them.
