I'm looking for help with PCI-E interrupts. The problem occurs with the following device:
01:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN Mini-PCI Card (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Unknown device 1363
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 20
        Memory at c3000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 2
        Capabilities: [58] Message Signalled Interrupts: Mask- 64bit- Queue=0/0 Enable-
        Capabilities: [d0] Express Legacy Endpoint IRQ 0
        Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting
        Capabilities: [13c] Virtual Channel
The card is recognized as of the PCI-E variety and appears to be set up properly, but interrupts are
not delivered to the driver as shown by the output of 'cat /proc/interrupts':
           CPU0       CPU1

I'm currently have an i386 system, but the problem is there with an x86_64 system. I've tried the
following boot-time fixups: acpi=noirq, irqfixup, irqpoll, pci=routeirq and a UP system without any
effect. It did work a couple of times with the x86_64 system, which made me think it was some kind
of race condition. I have also compared the bcm43xx code with that of the bcm43xx-d80211 version
that works, but I don't find any differences other than those related to design changes. I'm
currently working with 2.6.20-rc4, but get the same results with 2.6.18 and 2.6.19, which need a
PCI-E patch to recognize the card.
I would appreciate any suggestions regarding differences between PCI and PCI-E interrupts.
Thanks,
Larry
