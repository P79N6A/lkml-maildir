Hi there,

Ok, I would say there are several reasons:
   - People like themes and this makes the theme madness more
     complete
   - Some people get nervous, if they see text (esp. slow
     readers for obvious reasons)
   - Other people consider graphics archaic and "uncool"
The last 2 apply to kids as well.
So there are usability concerns and the boot might be the right
place to implement that kind bootscreen retainment.
Showing the dmesg log buffer on panic or BUG would be a nice
thing, to retain usability in that case as well.
Regards
Ingo Oeser
