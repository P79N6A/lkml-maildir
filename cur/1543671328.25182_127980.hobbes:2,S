psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
This is the message produced by 2.5.68 (dmesg) if the mouse is moved fast 
enough (in may case a touchpad or the USB mouse) and in such a way the 
the (KDE) applicaction _seems_ to be forced to redraw the window.
The effect is that several KDE menus start to appear magically.
Some info:
- Kernel preempt is enabled.
- It has the same effect with/without dri.
- It occurs very often, always if you move the pointer from one side to 
the other of the screnn.
- It doesn't happen if the point doesn't go out from a window.
- Xfree 4.3/KDE 3.1.1
- X is not reniced.
- PIII speedstep (Latitude X200 - 933 MHz)
Hope this helps.
