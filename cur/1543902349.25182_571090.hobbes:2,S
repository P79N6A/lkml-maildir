Tricky indeed.

We don't support this model at all, and it doesn't appear to work anyway.

Deadlock. If you get an IRQ for a guest and you block the IRQ until the
guest handles it you may (eg if the IRQ is shared) get priority inversion
with another interrupt source on the same line the guest requires first
(eg disks and other I/O)

Yes. This is the big reason Linux has never supported this kind of model
for anything but old ISA IRQ handling in vm86.

Mask the interrupt in the main kernel, pass an event of some kind to the
guest. You can describe most devices from guest to kernel in a safe form
as
device, bar, offset, register size, mask, bits to set, bits to clear
(or bits to test when deciding if it is the irq source)
