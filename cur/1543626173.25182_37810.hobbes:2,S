Hi,
we've tryed to compile Linux Kernel 2.4.18 on a Compaq Proliant ML370 G2, 
Pentium III 1.13Ghz, 1GB RAM, 2x36.4GB HD and SCSI Controller Compaq Smart2 5i,
firmware version 1.80. The problem is that if we enable the
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM to 4GB in order to enable full 1GB support, the kernel
will panic saying that it cannot correctly access the 
/dev/cciss/c0d0p1 root partition. Disabling the CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM support
all works fine.
Is this a known issue?
More info about our setup:
Debian 3.0
gcc version 2.95.4
Let me know if you need more info.
TIA.
Kind regards,
Luca
