Hi all,
Since 2.6.20-rc1 or so, running "make" always builds a new kernel with
an incremented version number, whether there has actually been any
change done to the code or configuration or not. This increases the
build time quite a bit.
I've tracked it down to include/linux/compile.h always being updated,
and this is because .version is updated. I couldn't find what is
causing .version to be updated each time though. Can anybody help
there? Was this change made on purpose or is this a bug which we should
fix?
Thanks,
