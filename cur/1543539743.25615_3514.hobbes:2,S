A virus that would not reveal its nature is rather pointless, and it
took quite some time until CIH showed up, but I'm pretty sure that an
E-Mail or some other virus will show up that strides to grind the disk
into pieces. Lusers don't need to update disk drive firmware,
particularly not without removing or setting Jumpers.
Ever considered why now there are DualBIOS and the like? To keep things
steady with frequent BIOS flashes, have live backups in case flashing
goes wrong.
Impending support costs for firmware updates may improve firmware
quality BEFORE delivery - at least for some manufacturers.
