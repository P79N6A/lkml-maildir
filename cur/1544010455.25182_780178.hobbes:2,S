By your own saying, the problem solved by libperfmon is a hard problem
(and I fully understand that).
Now you say there is software out there that doesn't use libperfmon,
that means they'll have to duplicate that functionality.
And only commercial software has a clear gain by wastefully duplicating
that effort. This means there is an active commercial interest to not
make perfmon the best technical solution there is, which is contrary to
the very thing Linux is about.
What is worse, you defend that:

No! what people want is their problem fixed - no matter how. That is one
of the powers of FOSS, you can fix your problems in any way suitable.
Would it not be much better if those folks duped into using a binary
only product only had to upgrade their FOSS kernel, instead of possibly
forking over more $$$ for an upgrade?
You have just irrevocably proven to me this needs to go into the kernel,
as the design of perfmon is little more than a GPL circumvention device
- independent of whether you are aware of that or not.
For that I hereby fully NAK perfmon
