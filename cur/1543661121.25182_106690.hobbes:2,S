Subject: [PATCH] fix for "assertion (newsk->state != TCP_SYN_RECV) ..."
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/31/12

Chris and others, this below should cure the infamous:
KERNEL: assertion (newsk->state != TCP_SYN_RECV) failed at tcp.c(2229)
KERNEL: assertion ((1<<sk2->state)&(TCPF_ESTABLISHED|TCPF_CLOSE_WAIT|TCPF_CLOSE)) failed at af_inet.c(689)
assertion failures people have been seeing starting in 2.4.20
The bug is in 2.5.x too, and the patch below applies pretty cleanly
there.
This has been sent to Marcelo already, and Linus will get it for
2.5.x when he gets back.
Thanks to everyone for reporting.  The fact that multiple reports
existed made it possible for to figure out what was so common
amongst the reports and thus find the bug relatively quickly.
