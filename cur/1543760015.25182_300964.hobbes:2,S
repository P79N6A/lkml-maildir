When I mount the root file-system and the proc file-system on
an embedded system, I use MS_NOATIME|MS_NODIRTIME for the flags.
No errors are reported and the file-systems are mounted.
However, the (struct stat) st_mtime of the /proc directory
is updated at every access and the st_mtime of any special
files like terminals are also updated. In fact, the time
appears to be updated on every keystroke when a terminal
is active on the file-systems.
How do I prevent this from occurring? These files were
NOT modified and st_mtime is supposed to show the
modification times, not the time at which it was
accessed.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
