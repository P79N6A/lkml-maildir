Agreed, I think this is clear.

To me this is still grey, and comes down to opinions of style.  I
happen to like the way code looks when things are split up into
drivers (that know a lot about the hardware and protects it from data
that will turn it into a brick) and application code that talks to the
interface defined by the driver.
The libusb based applications I've seen tend to be quite convoluted
and do a poor job of separating the USB protocol from the application
protocol for talking to the device.
I don't think there is a clear way to define when to do a kernel
driver vrs just use a libusb thing, other than if no one does a kernel
driver for a device then users are stuck with the libusb applications.
If someone steps up and does one and is willing to support it, then to
me its like, "whatever" add the driver. 
BTW I don't know if its worth to code bloat for my driver as I ponder
this issue now.  I like the way non-libusb applications look more but
I guess I could create a lib of api-wrappers to the libusb interface
and use that, but I really think its less code to create a simple
kernel driver.  
If it where up to me, I would say if the LOC is smaller to have a
kernel driver and application then a kernel driver is justified
otherwise its not.
