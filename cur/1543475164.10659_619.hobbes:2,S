Perhaps it is because Linux vendors are trying to make their
distributions more compatible (through projects such as the LSB) and
such a naming convention would only serve to drive them further apart.
The distributions are not that different anyway, compared to the
various flavours of BSD, which I presume the Vendor field was intended
to distinguish between.
Think of a new user's confusion as (s)he attempts to use a
system where some of the packages report *-redhat-linux and
others *-debian-linux?
