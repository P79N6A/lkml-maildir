Then the kernel community is no longer fit to use my code. So you should
remove everything I've written from Linus kernel too. I'll maintain my
own kernel.
Oh gosh, look I've just crippled Linus tree and stolen his project.
Thats *WHY* you can't just rip drivers out. A license was granted, for

from the author credits.
