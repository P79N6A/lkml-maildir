Yes, and we're willing to do a lot of it. 
That's been the intention the whole time, and would have been done sooner,
but it's taken a freakin' long time to figure out what assumptions to make
in the core. And of course, they're not always right. ;) Which means
there's more work to be done there. The feedback is greatly appreciated,
and I'm always open to more..
Thanks,
