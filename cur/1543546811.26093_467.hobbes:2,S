You tried using 1632-byte chunks split from 8 kB allocations?
The 8 kB blocks can be allocated well in advance of need, so
that the fragmentation problem doesn't hurt too much.
What about huge network servers, like those used for benchmarks?
We already have a TCP window size option... might as well change
that to be a general large-memory networking option if needed.
