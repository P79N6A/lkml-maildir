Nope.
$ ps -ef|grep lock
root        77     5  0 Nov20 ?        00:00:00 [kblockd/0]
foo       6811  6800  0 14:29 pts/0    00:00:00 grep -E lock

Er... sort of?
# netstat -ap | grep 32768
udp    11144      0 *:32768                 *:*                                -                   
I'm not sure what that means...  lsof|grep 32768 returns nothing.

Not that I know of.

Nope, that file contains a 0.  I can't think of anything that would be
changing parameters like this.
There are several identical workstations like this, and all the ones
that are used regularly have lost their lockd.  There's one that's
located in an inconvenient place and nobody ever uses it - this one
still has lockd running.
