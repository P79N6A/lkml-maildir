Subject: [PATCH] md: Remove broken SIGKILL support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/19/116

From: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
Currently md_thread calls allow_signal so it can receive a
SIGKILL but then does nothing with it except flush the
sigkill so that it not can use an interruptible sleep.
This whole dance is silly so remove the unnecessary
and broken signal handling logic.
