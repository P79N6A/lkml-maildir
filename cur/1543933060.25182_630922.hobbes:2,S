    x86: fix die() to not be preemptible
    Andrew "Eagle Eye" Morton noticed that we use raw_local_save_flags()
    instead of raw_local_irq_save(flags) in die(). This allows the
    preemption of oopsing contexts - which is highly undesirable. It also
    causes CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT to complain, as reported by Miles Lane.
