Thanks. The fault is happening in the list_del() at line 301 of
fs/inode.c; the penultimate line of __refile_inode(). It seems 
that inode->i_list.prev is an invalid pointer, which caused it to oops
while holding the inode_lock.
At least, it _should_ have oopsed -- the call trace shows it's gone
through die() and do_exit(). I don't understand why you didn't get
anything on the console.
Neither do I understand why i_list.prev is corrupt. Not seeing the oops
and knowing what it actually was doesn't help. Rik?
