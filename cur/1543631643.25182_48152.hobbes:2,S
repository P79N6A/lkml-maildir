kernel.org had a multiple-disk failure and lost its archive RAID.  From 
the looks of it, several disks started developing "threshhold" failures 
at least two weeks ago, possibly in conjunction with the system being 
moved to a new rack.  Unfortunately the RAID controller didn't down the 
disks as they started having problems, and the system was allowed to 
keep running until it finally crashed due to data corruption.
Compaq is investigating the failure, and will probably give us the 
hardware for the #2 server that we asked for a few months ago (they've 
been occupied with some kind of merger...)
