I guess you could have multiple modules, one providing the generic code
and the dev interface etc (tpm.ko) and then one per hardware chip
(tmp-nsc.ko, tpm-atmel.ko, tpm-atmel-i2c.ko). 
The hardware modules can then call tpm_register_hardware() in their
module_init function. 
Perhaps it would make sense to put the PCI bus stuff and things like
that in the hardware module as well, since e.g. an i2c chip would not
fit into that model
