Well, yes, I could add that paranoia to the core.  Added to the todo
list.
But the core will re-init rfkill->state from rfkill->get_state(), so
it is not a serious problem at all (since the drive provides
rfkill->get_state().
The reason it is recommended to always init the thing, is that if you
later move to a purely event-driven rfkill interface, you won't break
things.
