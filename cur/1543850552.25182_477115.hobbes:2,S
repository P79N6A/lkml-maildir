Agreed, I had to turn about 20 dual-core servers to single core because
the only way to get a monotonic gtod made it so slow that it was not
worth using a dual-core. I initially considered buying one dual-core
AMD for my own use, but after seeing this, I'm definitely sure I won't
ever buy one as long as this problem is not fixed, as it causes too
many problems.
