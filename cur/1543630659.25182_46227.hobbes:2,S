:) Some nice day this card will work.
I know it. It's too bad I don't have time to mess with it right now.

The slowdown I was talking about was actually with the new abort/underrun 
handling - I had tried it by myself before your patch. That's the what that 
quote was about. I think I handled both Abort and Underrun like that.
I'll try that new patch that you're making to retest.

No, I haven't messed with those bits, to answer Urban and your question.
I've only tried your patch which forces the backoff algortihm to AMD.
Tests sound like a good idea. I'll try something out when I have time - been 
busy lately.

On Urban's question,  I test without MMIO so this is not a related issue. I 
was merely curious since I don't feel comfortable trusting something which
A) does not match any of the other Rhine-based cards (2's and 3's)
B) says RESERVED in the docs which I have.
Funny, I was going to send you a link to the newer docs, but I ran into the 
older ones which I had never seen before. Yes, they do agree with the current 
code. Hmm. Perhaps we should ask VIA why it was changed...
