Hi Andrew,
The first patch in this patchset makes multiple marker users play together
nicely (SystemTAP, LTTng, blktrace...) by allowing multiple probes to be
connected to a single marker.
The second patch is used by SystemTAP to export the markers to a file using
modpost.
It would be interesting to consider getting these in soonish, so we can have
a stabilized marker API for 2.6.24.
This patchset applies on top of 2.6.24-rc4 in this order :
markers-support-multiple-probes.patch
linux-kernel-markers-create-modpost-file.patch
Thanks,
Mathieu
