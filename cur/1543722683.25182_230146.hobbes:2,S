Can someone please explain me *what* the effects of a `buggy app' would
be: Segfault I suppose. But what to do with a commerical app where I
cannot check a stack trace or whatever?
Background: I am having problems with current debian/sid on 2.6.7-mm2
with vuescan.
Best wishes
Norbert

STURRY (n.,vb.)
A token run. Pedestrians who have chosen to cross a road immediately
in front of an approaching vehicle generally give a little wave and
break into a sturry. This gives the impression of hurrying without
having any practical effect on their speed whatsoever.
