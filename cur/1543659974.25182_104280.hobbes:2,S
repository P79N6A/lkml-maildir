Masks are never shared.

Yes.  Up to the point where a fatal signal isn't caught and the process
is killed.  At that point all threads except the one responsible for the
termination is stopped and then terminated.

Well, the above is what POSIX requires and what I think we've
implemented.  These requirements are essential for programs which do
much of their work in signal handlers.  Creating more threads which
mainly just sit around but can react to signals is a valid programming
model.
