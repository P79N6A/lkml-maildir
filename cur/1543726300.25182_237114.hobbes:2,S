I've already used these cards with larger MTU to experiment some tunnelling
without decreasing the tunnel's MTU. I believe I used a NIC MTU around 1518
so that it could pass a cisco switch limited to 1536 bytes per frame. It
never went into production but it worked well.

I noticed a bug in the 2.4 tulip driver concerning MTU. The parameter
is correctly declared as a static int, initialized with default values,
checked by the code, but not declared as MODULE_PARM, so the user cannot
change it ! I wanted to send a patch but didn't find time to work on it
yet. So if your vlan patch fixes it, it's welcome :-)
Cheers,
Willy
