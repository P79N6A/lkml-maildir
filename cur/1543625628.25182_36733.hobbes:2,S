This is a general linux question, not really a kernel question. Does
anyone know if there is a "simple" good way to print code from linux at
the command promt.  On a Solaris machine,
/usr/openwin/bin/mp -o -l filename
gives me a page with 2 columuns, user_name, date, and pagenumber at the
top of each column, and the filename at the bottom of each column. I've
read  lots of howtos and man pages, even wrote a perl script to wrap the
lines for me, but I haven't figured out how to get the same format from
Linux as I do from Solaris.
Thanks!
