I've split out your two changes into seperate patches (patches 21 and
22) and made them available here:

I'm not seeing any warnings, which compiler version are you using ?

Should we really be exporting a kdev_t to userland, why not just print out
<major>:<minor>

What you've done looks fine to me, though allocating a whole page to
hold a single number seems overkill.  Why don't you just snprintf into
a char[] held on the stack ?

The files can be larger than a single page, which complicates things
somewhat.
