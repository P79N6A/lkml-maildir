Currently it may be possible to specify the mapping with kernel
arguments, although I don't know how to do it.  Switching from
red hat 6.0 to red hat 6.1 on a machine with an ISA ne2000 and
a PCI ne2000, the devices traded numbers, which made upgrading
this particular NAT router somewhat more complex than expected.
Standardization, even if it wasn't obvious, would be certainly
welcome.
