Well the original complaint was that Linux NFS didn't allow a directory to
be fsync()ed. I showed that POSIX.4 doesn't provide for fsync()ing
directories, only files, that you have to fsync() individual files, not
the directories that contain them. Others said that fsync()ing individual
files was not necessary, that you only have to fsync() the directory. I
explained that you have to cheat to even get a fd that can be used
to fsync() a directory. Then I showed that fsync()ing a directory in this
manner doesn't work so, we are actually in violent agreement.
