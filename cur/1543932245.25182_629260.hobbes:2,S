So why not keep to the Linux convention?  How about at_readl() and
at_writel() ?

There's two schools of thought - those who want to add 'inline' keywords
all over the place and those who don't.  It's quite correct that if a
static function will be inlined by the compiler as it sees fit.  It
_can_ be that the compiler will chose not to inline it and that may
result in better register allocation in the caller, resulting in overall
faster code.

Even though it doesn't matter at the moment, I rather like to think a
bit about the future.  If the kernel has a simple and cheap mechanism
there's no reason to avoid using it.

I think someone's mailer might be messing with the patches.  The above
removed and added lines appear to be identical.
