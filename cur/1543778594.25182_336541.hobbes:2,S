IIRC, there was a time when the extern inline construct was used to 
catch cases where the compiler did not inline the function (you'd get a 
link error).  Seems like it still works.  Try building the attached 
files in each of the following ways:
gcc -o foo foo.c
    and
gcc -O2 -o foo foo.c
In the first case, you get a link error, because there is no inlining.

#include "bar.h"
void foo(void) {
	bar();
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	foo();
	return 0;
}
extern inline void bar(void)
{
}
