Since Linux can run with kernel space controlled by MMU mappings and
with a few sanity checks in the PCI mapping code it should be possible
to make it reasonably robust. It would have to corrupt its kernel page
table mappings and then corrupt itself to scribble through them to fail.
Going beyond that is hairy because you then need to virtualise the
hardware interfaces and also run the kernel in ring 3 with seperate
guarded page tables
