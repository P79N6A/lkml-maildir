That's what I call 100 billion dollar planning...
I've written some pretty long notes on this in the past, so I'll be
short.  This thinking is what caused the 'Y2K' problem.  Most
likely the world won't suffer too much as a result of Y2K, but
fixing it was damn expensive, plus we all looked like idiots.  I'd
rather not look like an idiot again in 2038.  Lets fix the problem
before it turns into a crisis.
Mike
