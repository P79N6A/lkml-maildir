Alan's rework of the receive tty buffering went
into 2.6.16 and cured some problems, but clearly not yours.
Some more adjustments are in 2.6.18-rc4, so that
would be interesting to try for diagnosing this.
I was wondering if the problem was interrupt latency,
the tty receive buffering, or something totally different.
I don't know if your problem and Raphael's are caused
by the same mechanism. I would still like to know which
kernel versions he has tried.
Does the MIDI device using the standard N_TTY line discipline?
Are you using the low_latency flag on the serial device?
What type of UART has been tested (16550? other?)
Are you seeing overruns or just lost data?
Thanks,
Paul
