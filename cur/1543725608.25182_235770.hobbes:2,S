Evan,
Have you found (1) Linus' 2.6 bk tree to meet your needs over the last
few months?  Or (2) has it been too unstable for you?
If (1), seems like you might be in good shape, as from what I can
gather of this (not being in Ottawa) next month looks alot like
last month, so far as how Linux is developed.
If (2), then perhaps there is an opportunity here for a derivative of
Linus' tree that is "stabilized a bit", but not overly patched like
certain vendor kernels I won't name.
Yes, we'd all like the head kernel to march to the beat of our
particular needs, rapidly changing and adding what we need without
delay, leaving the rest untouched, and never breaking.
Now ... back to reality ...
