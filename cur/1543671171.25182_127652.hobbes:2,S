Andi,
2.4.21-rc1 on x86_64 oopses on me at shutdown -h in certain situations.
It's repeatable. Here's the raw oops:
Turning off swap:				[  OK  ]
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000010010000000
 printing rip:
ffffffff801ed7ea

Call Trace: <1>Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual addre
ss 0000000000000000
 printing rip:
ffffffff8010de83
The call trace is inaccessible because the stack dumper itself immediately
triggers a new oops (ffffffff8010de83 is show_trace+0x223), resulting in the
second oops repeating rapidly until Simics hangs or gets a triple fault.
I had to ^C Simics and copy-paste the first oops from the Simics Console window.
The RIP of the first oops, ffffffff801ed7ea, is copy_user_generic+0xea.
1. ksymoops-2.4.9 hangs on the raw oops.
2. The kernel is 2.4.21-rc1 with modules, modversions, and kmod enabled.
   ide-cd, cdrom, isofs, and af_packet were loaded at the point of the oops.
   modutils-2.4.22-10 from RedHat rawhide's x86_64 .rpm.
4. Steps to reproduce: boot; find / -type f -print; rpm -qa | sort | diff -u /tmp/old.rpmlist -;
   mount /mnt/cdrom (with no cdrom in cd drive, but it loads the modules); sync;
   shutdown -h now. The oops occurs just after init's "Turning off swap:", at
   the "Halting system..." step (which is probably where copy_user came from).
5. A monolithic kernel doesn't oops.
