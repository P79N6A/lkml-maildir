| | Most probably a configuration error, viz. choosing a CPU type
| | higher than generic 586. My Socket7 ASUS T2P4 with a Pentium
| | Classic (pre-MMX) 133MHz boots 2.5.66 just fine.
| 
| Yes, I agree with that suggestion, but I don't see a problem.
| Did you look at his .config file?  It's here:

| 
| I'm comparing it to the .config on my Pentium-with-f00f-bug, which does
| boot 2.5.65 successfully, and I don't see CPU option differences.
| I see lots that don't matter and I see PIIX vs. VIA option differences.
| 
| Oh, and I have CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV enabled, while Robins does not.
| Would that matter?
Ugh, never mind that last part.  I was thinking that was CONSOLE stuff,
but it's not.
