Yes, that's why the "send_arp" step is in there--it sends out a
gratuitous arp reply that causes the other machines to update their arp
caches.
Anyways, as I said in the earlier message the delays that I am seeing
are on the outgoing side, not the incoming side.  Incoming packets come
in on the new interface immediately (showing that the arp caches have
indeed been updated) but outgoing packets go out the old interface for
an additional few seconds after route shows the new interface as the
only way to access the .0.0 subnet.
