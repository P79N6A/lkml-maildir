I don't think anything gets bloated, at least in the default case.
Every task points to one and only one container.  Things that currently
take tasks as arguments still take tasks.  If something handling tasks
suddenly needs to worry about containers as well, we simply infer the
container from the task.
In the very, very rare cases where we can't do that (like a fork()
boundary), we _do_ change the APIs to take both task and container.
However, these are few and far between, so it isn't that much of a
headache.
In the cases where pids were referenced, and are no longer unique, we
use Eric's weak task references.  Right?
