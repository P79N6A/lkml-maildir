These drivers are currently in the v4l-dvb tree 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mchehab/v4l-dvb.git;a=summary
 in 
the devel branch.

I'm storing the GPIO number locally, and if the system doesn't have a 
valid GPIO for me, I'm storing an invalid GPIO number. Then at any time if 
the GPIO has to be used, I just verify if gpio_is_valid(), and if not, 
return an error code for this request, but the driver remains otherwise 
functional.
Thanks
