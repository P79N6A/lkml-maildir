I think we in PPC land have gotten used to that "style" because we have 
one kernel that supports different "platforms", i.e. it selects the 
appropriate code at runtime as George says. In general that's a little 
bit slower and a little bit bigger.
Unless you need to choose among PPC KGDB functions at runtime, which I 
don't think you do, you don't need it...
