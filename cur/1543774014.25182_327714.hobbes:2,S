    NO! You don't do it that way in the kernel. Think: if you have to
pass a '-D' option for each config item you set, you will end up with
TONS of '-D' options, in fact you probably exceed the command line
size limit.
    You have to include <linux/config.h> if I recall correctly ;)
    Good luck!
