shmget (0x1): Invalid argument
So this seems to work.

Yes, it does. You can increase the maximum overall size with mount
option nr_blocks (in 4K blocks on ia32) and the maximum number of
objects with nr_inodes.
from ipc/shm.c:
 * There are the following mount options:
 * - nr_blocks (^= shmall) is the number of blocks of size PAGE_SIZE
 *   we are allowed to allocate
 * - nr_inodes (^= shmmni) is the number of files we are allowed to
 *   allocate
 * - mode is the mode for the root directory (default S_IRWXUGO | S_ISVTX)
