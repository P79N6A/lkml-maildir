Hi Jeff,
I'm submitting a set of bug fixes for inclusion in 2.6.22.
The patches are built against Linus'git tree.
Here is a brief description:
- Fix page management in the SGE code,
- Fix netpoll handler,
- Fix link status detection for direct XAUI adapters,
- Update FW to 4.1 and proceed to subsequent HW tuning,
- Work around potential hang on MTU change,
- Fix MAC watchdog,
- Allow microcode update without a power cycle.
Cheers,
Divy
