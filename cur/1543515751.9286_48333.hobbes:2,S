Trying to port the SGI lcrash code to 2.3.26 ix86.  It compiles, runs,
traps the oops, starts writing the dump to swap, dies with -EFAULT in
sd_raw_rw.  My guess is because the buffer address is c2c00000, i.e. I
am trying to do I/O directly from kernel pages, not from user space.
sd_raw_rw() calls map_user_kiobuf() which is perfect for user space
callers, no good for kernel callers.  How do I get around this?
Changing sd_raw_rw to indicate if the caller is kernel or user would
work but is clumsy, all callers have to change.  Can I map the kernel
pages into user space, if so how?  Or would set_fs (get_ds()) fudge the
mappings enough to work?
