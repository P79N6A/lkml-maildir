No, look further down in apic.c: APIC_init_uniprocessor() calls 
setup_IO_APIC() which then calls setup_ioapic_ids_from_mpc(). This happens 
after the code quoted above runs.
Additionally, in 2.4.x setup_local_APIC() also uses 
boot_cpu_physical_apicid, although only as a sanity check. That code 
is gone from (or never made it into) 2.5.

But is it necessarily true that hard_smp_processor_id() equals the APIC
id?
Anyway, after applying Linus' patch, the first thing that touches
boot_cpu_physical_apicid becomes init_apic_mappings() which does:
        if (boot_cpu_physical_apicid == -1U)
                boot_cpu_physical_apicid = GET_APIC_ID(apic_read(APIC_ID));
and that's just about as good as it gets, certainly the CPU knows best 
what its APIC id is.
