I have yet to fix them. Note that they are NOT as serious as described.
One requires a local user to have access to the devices. Generally this
isn't the default case. The other one requires maliciously changed
firmware in an external device. Not too many people have the know-how and
desire to do this, just to crash your system (they would have better luck
just beating your box with a hammer).
The other bug about allocating huge amounts of memory is just plain wrong,
and is not a bug. It cannot happen.
I'll be fixing things this weekend.
