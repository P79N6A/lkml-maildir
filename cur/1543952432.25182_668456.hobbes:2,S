I don't think so.

You said that you could achieve a certain performance, and later you
said that for reliability you could use mirroring and replication but
you never said that would lead to a performance hit.  In fact you don't
seem to be able to offer performance AND robustness; for performance you
can only offer that level of robustness attainable on a single system,
which means I think even you agreed was really not up to snuff for
customers who would need the performance that you claim to achieve.

But the filesystem does offer a minimum level of consistency, which is
missing from what you propose.  You propose writing nothing unless
line-power fails.  The big buffer cache gives you all of the robustness
of the underlying filesystem and including dirty buffer writes at some
level greater than zero.

I haven't said that at all, other than as an axiom (which even you have
agreed is fair) leading to comments on the results when something does
fail.  You keep saying that it won't ever fail, then that it will but
that you can mitigate using redundant systems; and then you gloss over
or refuse to face the attendant performance hit.  Finally, you still
have no idea whether your idea really does achieve a massive performance
boost.  You've never compared like amounts of RAM, nor the unsynced
updates that most closely resemble your idea.  In short, you've leaped
on what seems to you to be a good idea and steadfastly refused to
conduct even basic research.  What's the point?
You say don't cc you; I say go away, do that basic research, and come
back when you have hard data.  I really don't think you can ask for
fairer than that.
