I'm not sure if I agree with this patch.  "struct resource" is used primarily for
I/O resource assignment.  Although I agree we may need to add new IORESOURCE types,
I'm not sure if clock data belongs here.  I don't think "start" and "end" would be
useful for most platform data.  Could you provide more information about this
specific issue and resource type?  Maybe we could create a new sysfs attribute?
Thanks,
Adam
