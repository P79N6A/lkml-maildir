I have conversed with Michael Meeks and Mark McLoughlin about this
problem.  They agree that this is a bug in either the 2.5 kernel
or in ORBit 1.x.  ORBit interacts with the kernel at a pretty
low level in some places.  Neither Michael or Mark have time to
look into this problem at the moment, since they are both busily
working on the Gnome 2.0 release and neither of them have a test
machine with the 2.5 kernel installed.
So, you and I will just have to be patient.  Eventually, this will
get tracked down and fixed.
Best wishes,
	Miles
