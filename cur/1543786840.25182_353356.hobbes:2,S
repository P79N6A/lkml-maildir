Hi all,
A new release of the ocf-linux package is up:
	
http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/
Mostly fixes in this release.  I had been sitting on sme tof this for
too long.  Best to check the Changelog below for some of the specifics.
At least some 2.6 testing was done for this release :-)
Changes:
* Much improved 2.6 support in OCF
* Openswan patch has full ESP/AH acceleration
* Updated crypto-tools with many fixes/additions
* Much more reliable (will not exhaust system resources under heavy load)
Cheers,
Davidm
