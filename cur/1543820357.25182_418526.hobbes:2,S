It's messy. That whole ELCR register was mis-designed: you can change the 
edge/level detection with it, but since it _also_ changes the polarity of 
the signal, you can't actually do so from a sw angle, and it has to match 
the hardware. So you can't say "I want to treat this interrupt as level 
triggered", and just set the bit ;^/
To make matters worse, I wouldn't be in the least surprised if the ELCR 
register is totally ignored by many south-bridges for the internally 
generated interrupts (ie devices that are embedded in the SB), since the 
register really doesn't matter for them.
And it doesn't help that Intel mis-designed the edge-detection logic on 
the IO-APIC. On the old i8259, if you masked an interrupt and unmasked it, 
an active interrupt would always be seen as an edge, because the 
edge-detection was done _after_ masking. On the IO-APIC crap, the masking 
is done after edge-detection, so if you mask the APIC hardware level, and 
an edge happens, you'll never ever learn of it ever again.
I'm sure other system architectures have similar problems, but it's 
irritating.
