Ugs.
/proc/1 and /proc/1/task/1 are two different dentrys.
proc_task_lookup happily overwrites task->proc_dentry. Which means the 
task patch broke tsk->proc_dentry.
I think the cure is simple: proc_task_lookup should not write 
proc_dentry, only proc_pid_lookup should do that.
tsk->proc_dentry is only used by proc_pid_flush: If a task exits, all 
entries below /proc/<pid> are stale, and a shrink_dcache_parent on the 
/proc/<pid> dentry recovers the memory.
There is a race between in proc_pid_lookup between checking that the 
task is still running and setting tsk->proc_dentry, but AFAICS the race 
is not critical: In the worst case, the stale dentries remain around. 
They are never returned to user space, d_revalidate prevents that.
