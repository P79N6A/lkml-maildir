Hmmh, that almost sounds to me like the hardware might be flaky.
Strange though that it would work with an SMP kernel.  I use UP
kernels a lot on my home machine (zx2000) so what you're seeing
certainly seems unusual.  Can you try with the latest linux-ia64-2.5
repository?  If that doesn't work, I guess we'll have to sit down and
look into what's different about your setup/configuration.
