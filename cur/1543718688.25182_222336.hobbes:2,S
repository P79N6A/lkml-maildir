I'd be a bit reluctant to do this.  filesystems actually have no need for
page_mapping() - page->mapping is always correct in that context and
page_mapping() has additional overhead.  So if poss we should avoid this
export so as to force filesystems to avoid page_mapping().
parisc broke because its flush_dcache_page() is inlined, and it uses
page_mapping().  I'd suggest that parisc and arm uninline that function -
it's quite large anyway.
