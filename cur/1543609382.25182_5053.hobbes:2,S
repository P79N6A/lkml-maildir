That only takes care of writebacks. Don't forget that reading &
readahead can also eat memory if somebody forgets to call lock_page()
(a common problem on 'hard,intr' mounts).
You'll notice that in the NFS updates I sent you the other day, there
is a new function 'nfs_try_to_free_pages()' that provides a rather
generic way of freeing up NFS memory resources. Its sole purpose today
is to ensure that we keep an upper limit of 256 requests per mount.
My (still somewhat vague) plan is to expand that interface some time
during 2.5.x to allow the VM to control and limit the memory usage of
the NFS client - flushing out read and write requests if necessary.
IMHO, the filesystem can often be more efficient at clearing out pages
if we leave the choice of strategy up to it, rather than having the VM
micro-manage exactly which page is to be thrown out first.
For instance, under NFSv3 there is usually a huge advantage to sending
off a COMMIT over any other call, since it can potentially free up a
whole truckload of pages.
Cheers,
