Is there a way to use this for ISA devices? I'd like to convert my
tms380tr request_firmware() as i want to get rid of hardcoded, binary
only firmware. However, there is no struct device for ISA devices (and
in particular, no bus id) and unlike the old style PCI DMA mapping, which
accepts NULL as pci_dev and assumes ISA in this case, request_firmware()
absolutely needs the parameter...
