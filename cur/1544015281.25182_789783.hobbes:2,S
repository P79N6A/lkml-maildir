Didn't we already have that, but it got broken for some reason, by
unwanted changes in commit 4b29631db33292d416dc395c56122ea865e7635c
Your patch seems to have broken the Fedora kernel build for 'noarch',
which runs 'make firmware_install' without building a kernel.
Rafael, if you revert Sam's fix and also revert 4b29631d, does it work
again?
