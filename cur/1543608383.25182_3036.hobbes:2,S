Martin has it backwards, I think.  The 486 chip sets and (maybe) some
of the early Pentium chip sets from Intel are the ones that used Type 2.
All the PPro and newer chip sets use Type 1 so far as I am aware.  Also,
I don't know of any chips that support both -- you get one or the other.
So Type 1 does sound right for the 430VX.
