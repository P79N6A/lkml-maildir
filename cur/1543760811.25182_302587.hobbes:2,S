Acer Travelmate 803LCi, working Suspend to ram:
- Have to use the soft-boot method for the radeon
- Have to shutdown the following parts: 
  * hotplug (actually the USB subsystem, but hotplug does that nicely)
  * ALSA (modem won't work otherwise without reloading the modules)
    (snd_intel8x0m module)
  * MySQL (hinders the actual suspension process and kicks the pc back to 
    where it was)
Other than these little things it works like a charm :)
