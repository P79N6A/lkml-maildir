It's /cdrom here. I tried it on both /cdrom and /dev/cdrom after
unmounting it, and the output was blank.
While mounted, here was the output:
                     USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
/cdrom               root     kernel mount  /cdrom
No automatic removal. Please use  umount /cdrom
I guess that doesn't say much though...
