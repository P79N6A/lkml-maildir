That's actually what we currently do (at least in hand coded form) in
the current transport classes.  However, it leads to one separate group
for each attached class.  With the filter approach, we only need one
constructed group for every transport class.

visibility and creation are the same thing, aren't they?  An invisible
attribute doesn't appear in the sysfs directory, so it's equivalent to
the file for it not being created.
