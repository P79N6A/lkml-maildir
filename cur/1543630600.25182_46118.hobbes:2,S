I have had similar problems with integrated AIC7850 on Digital Celebris GL 5133
ST. 2.4.19-pre7 and pre8 only tested so far, no earlier kernels tested at all.
Selecting old adaptec scsi deriver works like a charm.
AN> aic7xxx_dev_reset returns 0x2002
I had 0x2008 here IIRC. Did not capture the output because this was about the
root partition and I had no serial cable at home. Will capture it with serial
console today.
