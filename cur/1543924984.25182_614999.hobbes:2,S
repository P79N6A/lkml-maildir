Thanks Neil for looking into this.  Your suggestion has already been answered 
in a previous post, where the difference has been attributed to "ls -l" 
inducing lookup for the first try, which is fast, and getattr for later 
tries, which is super-slow.
Now it's easy to blame the userland rpc.nfs.V2 server for this, but what's 
not clear is how come 2.4.31 handles getattr faster than 2.6.23?
Thanks!
