Tony, all,
I think I have solved the mystery.  I have my git tree pointing to
git.frob.com to try to lessen the load on kernel.org.  I am guessing
that the last time I pulled linus's tree from there they had not pulled
since the commit was made so I was still a little out of date.
The latest git pull now does indeed grab this commit.
sorry for any confusion I may have caused.
