I'll wait until the patch is in the official tree.  I am trying to patch rc6, 
but it seems you've made a lot of changes to your version of md.c:
patching file md.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 4038 (offset -338 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 4057 (offset -338 lines).
Hunk #3 FAILED at 4081.
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file md.c.rej
Thanks for the fix, though.  Hope to see it in the tree soon.
