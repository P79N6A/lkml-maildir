Almost all these advantages are also present for user-mode drivers...
and getting drivers out of the kernel, where possible, is a much
better approach IMHO than trying to maintain a leaky in-kernel
interface.  The problem with in-kernel interfaces, even if set in
concrete, is that any binary driver can go outside the interface ---
there's no encapsulation --- and so break when the kernel changes.
