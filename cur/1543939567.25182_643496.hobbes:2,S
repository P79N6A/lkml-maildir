.. I may have jumped the gun a "little" early saying that it is mostly

accurate :P

So, what you are saying is that it is expected to vary this much under 
memory pressure? That I can not do anything with this on real hardware?

I have all the numbers, I was just hoping that there was a way to 
benchmark a small change without a lot of runs. It seems to me to quite 
randomly distributed .. from the 2.6.23.14 runs:
43m10.022s, 34m31.104s, 43m47.221s, 41m17.840s, 34m15.454s,
37m54.327s, 35m6.193s, 38m16.909s, 37m45.411s, 40m13.169s
38m17.414s, 34m37.561s, 43m18.181s, 35m46.233s, 34m44.414s,
39m55.257s, 35m28.477s, 33m30.551s, 41m36.394s, 43m6.359s,
42m42.396s, 37m44.293s, 41m6.615s, 35m43.084s, 39m25.846s,
34m23.753s, 36m0.556s, 41m38.095s, 45m32.703s, 36m18.325s,
42m4.840s, 43m53.759s, 35m51.138s, 40m19.001s
Say I made a histogram of this (tilt your head :P) with 1 minute intervals:
33 *
34 *****
35 *****
36 **
37 ***
38 **
39 **
40 **
41 ****
42 **
43 *****
44
45 *
I don't really know what to make of that.. Going to see what happens 
with less memory and make -j1, perhaps it will be more stable.

Yes, I was hoping to have a more deterministic test to get a higher 
confidence in fewer runs when testing changes. Especially under memory 
pressure. And I truly was not expecting this much fluctuations, which is 
why I tested several kernel versions to see if this influenced it and 
mailed lkml. The computer is actually a dual core amd processor, but I 
compiled the kernel with no smp to see if that helped on the dispersion.
