I'm glad you seem to define kqueue "The Notification Mechanism", because
honestly, in my opinion "The Notification Mechanism" is what people
actually *uses* for real. Last time I checked "The Notification Mechanism"
is poll/select ( with kqueue pretty much down in the list ). Yes, maybe it
doesn't scale very well with high number of fds, but it does 99.99% of
what people needs. And the proof of this is that a huge number of
applications rely on poll/select. Why ? Beacause it's freakin' simple and
does the job. The new epoll interface aims to be that simple and to cover
the same needs that have driven developers to use select/poll. Who's right ?
Time will talk.
