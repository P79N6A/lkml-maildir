a kbash? ksh is taken... kash would become instantly confusing to some 
english-speakers... fun for some, but others would hear it and think 'cache' 
and immediately be thrown out of sync ;)
you could extend proc (or is it just sys?) that way, creating files that can 
trigger events ('echo (desired range) > /proc/sh/memdump/range', 'echo 1 
> /proc/sh/memdump/go' or even simply 'cat /proc/sh/memdump/out' after 
inputting range) and stick with the cat/echo control... some of your 
userspace shell's commands could simply be wrappers for ordinary 'echo foo 
> /proc/foo' already
OTOH, someone said proc's been abused already, having it do things that aren't 
its job and causing disorganization in the kernel. i dunno, that's why im not 
in charge
