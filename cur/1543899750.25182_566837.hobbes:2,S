It does look a little short... probably the rest just didn't make it to disk...

Different kernel source version, different configuration, probably
different compiler, Slackware doesn't patch the vanilla kernel - I
believe (k)ubuntu does.   All in all that equals a significantly
different kernel binary you have been running in those two cases.

0. Make sure the kernels loglevel is set so that you get all messages.
1. Make sure syslog is setup to capture all kernel messages, both
errors, warnings, notices, debug messages etc.
2. If you can, check output of 'dmesg' instead of just what made it to syslog.
3. If you have a second PC, setup serial console or netconsole to
capture kernel messages on that second box. This can sometimes capture
messages that don't make it to disk.
4. Build a custom kernel with some (or all) of the debug options under
the Kernel Hacking menu enabled.
5. Even when the system hangs you may in some cases be able to get
some info (or just sync the disks and do a reboot) via magic sysrq.
