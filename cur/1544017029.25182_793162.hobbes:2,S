Subject: [RFC] per-CPU cryptd thread implementation based on workqueue

Hi, Herbert,
The scalability of current cryptd implementation is not good. So a
per-CPU cryptd kthread implementation is necessary. The per-CPU kthread
pool implementation need to consider many issues such as CPU hotplug, so
I suggest to base cryptd kthread implementation on workqueue, that is,
create a dedicate workqueue for crypto subsystem. This way, chainiv can
use this crypto workqueue too.
I will implement it if you have no plan to do it yourself.
Best Regards,
Huang Ying
