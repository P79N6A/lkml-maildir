Since Red Hat works on CVS I wonder if they are breaking the license or
not. However thats not relevant right now. If I get stuff in .doc format
that I can't read I ask people to resend it in a format I can, ditto
bitkeeper or any other randomly weird VC file.
And no I don't want to use bitkeeper any more, your ever changing
licenses and removals of more and more rights have reminded me why 
many proprietary vendors just cannot be trusted and why format lockin
is so dangerous.
You are turning a simple "can I have that in a format I can read" into 
yet another epic bitkeeper flame war.
