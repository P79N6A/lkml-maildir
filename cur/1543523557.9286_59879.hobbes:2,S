I'm nearly done writing a accel engine console wrapper. It should also be
able to be used with non framebuffer cards as well as fbdev drivers. 
I need to deal with one more issus then test then submit the patch.

No!!!  Don't let user land have access to mode setting registers for video
cards. A rogue app could fry a monitor by miss programming the CRTC
register on purpose.

First you missed the point fo fbdev. It's to abstract mode setting. The
server doesn't need to know about the video hardware. Mode setting for
fbdev is done by opening /dev/fb and calling the set var ioctl call. As
for using the accel functions. I have written a console accel wrapper to
use accels. Right now fbdev drivers mmap the MMIO regions so the X server
can use the blit functions etc. I have patches to deal with MMIO access by
userland and accel use for the console systems. So their is no worry about
that.

Most fbdev driver can do that with fbset. Yes vesafb doesn't have that
ability.
