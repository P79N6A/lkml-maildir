This point has been discussed before, also regarding Jesper's work.
In short, Linus prefers the style you dislike, but doesn't enforce
things too rigidly.  Imo the "grep" argument doesn't really matter and
both styles have advantages sometimes.
Now to solve some of your problems a different way (in vim style):
o $ make tags
o $ vi foo.c
o move over any function
o ^]
o ^t
o :ts
o $ vi bar.c
o move over any identifier
o *
o #
Works like a charm for me.  lxr is still slightly better, but the
lacking integration into my editor makes is inferior in 99.9% of all
cases.
