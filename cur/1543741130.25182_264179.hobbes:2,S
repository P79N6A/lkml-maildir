OK, since we're going to be doing another round of
-rc-but-I-dont-really-mean-it, I've set up two scsi bk trees.
bk://linux-scsi.bkbits.net/scsi-rc-fixes-2.6
for fixes which I'll try and merge into -rc candidates
and
bk://linux-scsi.bkbits.net/scsi-misc-2.6
for everything else that will wait until 2.6.10 is released.
Andrew, could you add both these to -mm, please?
For the rc-fixes tree, I'm going to try to guess when linus moves to
-rc-and-I-really-mean-it and at that point I'll only accept critical bug
fixes into this tree (probably I'll tighten up submission policy
gradually as time goes by).
Also, I've gained a web page at
http://www.parisc-linux.org/~jejb/scsi_diffs
Where I'll place the diffs and changelogs corresponding to the scsi
trees for those who want to play with the updates without using BK.
James
