I have to admit that I wasn't aware of any such bug, and I regularly
use that very option to mount cd images for testing prior to burning
them out, and have never had any indication of a bug being present.
As a result, I would be VERY interested in details of this bug as it
exists in current 2.2 kernels.

If one uses the symlink, one would have to do so, but as I don't, I've
never bothered to do so.

The command `mount -o remount,r[ow]` doesn't work with the symlink if
there were any additional options supplied (either in /etc/fstab or
otherwise) when the partition was originally mounted, beyond the basic
"defaults" option.
As examples of this, I quote the following entries from my home
system, which is RedHat 6.0 using kernel 2.2.12:
 Q> /dev/hdb3 /cdimage ext2 defaults,ro,user 1 1
This entry can NOT be remounted rw, other than by the superuser, if
the symlink exists, even though the user option is supplied.
 Q> sun:/public /nfs/sun nfs noauto,ro,user,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
If the symlink exists, then `mount -o remount,rw /nfs/sun` results in
the rsize and wsize being reset to the default values, and performance
falls through the floor as a result.
Best wishes from Riley.
