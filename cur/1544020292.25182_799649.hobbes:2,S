Yes! but are the structures the same? that is sizeof(foo_packed) == sizeof(foo) ?
If not then clearly above is expected.
In anyway, if __attribute__((packed)) makes some brain-dead gcc do the wrong thing
putting a _Padding member where you expect an alignment hole, and a BUILD_BUG_ON(sizeof() != ())
statement somewhere in code is a must, specifically for the brain-dead.

There are to many places in Kernel where these things are left to chance that give
me an headache, not talking about cross platform mounts.
