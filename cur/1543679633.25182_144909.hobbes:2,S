The in-kernel vsprintf() is very primative, used for very simple
things. Note that it doesn't even have "%f". You should just
do something like:
	i = (int) *str + '0';
      ... if you need to read part of a number.
You don't really wany to increase the size of the permanent
in-kernel stuff if you can help. You add any increased functionality
to your modules so it is used only when needed.
