Subject: [PATCH] Keys: Replace duplicate non-updateable keys rather than failing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/17/129

The attached patch causes an attempt to add a duplicate non-updateable key
(such as a keyring) to a keyring to discard the extant copy in favour of the
new one rather than failing with EEXIST:
	# do the test in an empty session
	keyctl session
	# create a new keyring called "a" and attach to session
	keyctl newring a @s
	# create another new keyring called "a" and attach to session,
	# displacing the keyring added by the second command:
	keyctl newring a @s
Without this patch, the third command will fail.
For updateable keys (such as those of "user" type), the update method will
still be called rather than a new key being created.
