I get the feeling that we are adding more and more cruft to the M386 path,
that is only used for processors >386. While I can see the reasoning
behind this, maybe it's time to introduce a new compile-option.
CONFIG_M386_GENERIC, which is the crufted version with compability for all
processors
and
CONFIG_M386, which is cruftfree and known to work on 386's, without any
optimisations for other processors.
In my opinion, Linux is getting a bit too slow on 386's, without any real
reason.
