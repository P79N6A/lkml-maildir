Asking some of the things I guess others will ask later, but I won't
look into this anymore this night.
Have you been able to determine if it is I/O bound or CPU bound?
Or maybe using to much CPU to do I/O?
Does anyone know what virtual memory system does Mandrake uses? 
 Linus, Andreas or Riels?
 Have you tried Mandrakes support?
vmstat	over some time would be nice to get a hint on what it is doing.
ext3		do you use the same journaling mode as on Moja?
top		how much CPU time does the kernel processes use?
