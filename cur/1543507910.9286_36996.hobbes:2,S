 Hi, 
 It seems to me that the lookup in the rule database is not done corectly
as of 2.2.12.
 For example, I have a newly booted system with no firewall records, no
messing with the ip rule table, etc. I do:
[root@Invasion /root]# ipchains -A input -s 193.231.203.17 -d
193.231.236.130 -m 10 
[root@Invasion /root]# ip rule add from 0/0 fwmark 10 table 10 pref 10
Output of 'ip rule list':
0:      from all lookup local
10:     from all fwmark       10 lookup 10
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup 253
 After this, sending 1 ping packet from host 193.231.203.17 to
193.231.236.130 does NOT follow rule 10. 
 I've added some printk's in kernel space, and this is what I get from
syslog:
Sep  2 15:45:02 Invasion kernel: Received packet with fwmark 10, saddr
193.231.203.17 daddr 193.231.236.130. 
--this message is printk'ed in ip_rcv(), just before the line:
if (ip_route_input(skb, iph->daddr, iph->saddr, iph->tos, dev))
Sep  2 15:45:02 Invasion kernel: Ip route input slow: from 193.231.203.17
to 193.231.236.130 fwmarked with 10.
--this message is printk'ed in ip_route_input_slow(), just before the
line:
key.iif = dev->ifindex;
Sep  2 15:45:02 Invasion kernel: Fib lookup: we found a rule for a packet
with fwmark 10, that goes into table 255. Next is tblookup..
Sep  2 15:45:02 Invasion kernel: Fib lookup: we found a rule for a packet
with fwmark 10, that goes into table 254. Next is tblookup..
--this 2 messages are printk'ed in fib_lookup(), just before the line:
FRprintk("tb %d r %d ", r->r_table, r->r_action);
 So as far as I can see and with what I understood from the kernel source
the lookup is not done correctly.. it should lookup rule 10 before these
rules. If I haven't understood right, please corect me. :)
