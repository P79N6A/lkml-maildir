If I turn off CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC I get:
| ACPI disabled because your bios is from 00 and too old
| You can enable it with acpi=force
| Sony Vaio laptop detected.
and ACPI is disabled. Halt doesn't work.
If I then pass `acpi=force' to explicitly enable ACPI, `halt' works again and
powers off the machine, but `reboot' causes a black screen with IDE disk spun
down, but no restart.
