ABI changes or ABI additions?
If the ABI is not fixed that is a bug.  Admittedly some interfaces
in the development kernel are still under development and so have not
stabilized on an ABI but that is a different issue.

As the ABI remains fixed I remain unconvinced.  Multiple implementations
against the same ABI should be possible.  The real question which is the
more scalable way to do the code.
What I find truly puzzling is that after years glibc still needs
kernel headers at all.
