Subject: The ksummit-2005-discuss list has been set up.

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have created a mailing list for interested parties to discuss the 2005
Kernel Summit, which will be held before the Ottawa Linux Symposium, on
July 18th and 19th.  The list has been pre-populated with the program
committee for the 2005 Kernel Summit:
	Andrea Arcangeli	andrea@suse.de
	James Bottomley		James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com
	Jonathon Corbet		corbet@lwn.net
	Steve Hemminger		shemminger@osdl.org
	Gerrit Huizenga		gh@us.ibm.com
	Greg Kroah-Hartman	greg@kroah.com
	Matthew Mackall		mpm@selenic.com
	Andrew Morton		akpm@osdl.org
	Rik van Riel		riel@redhat.com
	Theodore Ts'o		tytso@mit.edu
(Many thanks to program commitee for being willing to serve this year!)
People who were on the 2004 Kernel Summit disucss list have *not* been
moved over to the 2005 list.  If you would like to join the list, you
will need to manually subscribe via the mailman URL:
	
http://www.thunk.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ksummit-2005-discuss
After this e-mail is sent, I will be very shortly deactivating the 2004
ksummit discussion list.
Topics for discussion for the ksummit-2005-discuss list will include: 
	* How well did the meeting logistics work last year?  
		How can they be improved?
	* What topics do you think should be included in the agenda?
	* How well did the invited panels work?  Who (if anyone) should
          invite this time?
If you have any comments that you wish to be only read by the program
committee, you may send us e-mail at: ksummit-2005-pc@thunk.org
Thanks!!
