Well, you just pointed me to a very nice paper that *makes* it precise:
Boaz Barak, Ronen Shaltiel, and Eran Tromer. True random number generators
secure in a changing environment. In Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware
and Embedded Systems (CHES), pages 166-180, 2003. LNCS no. 2779.
I haven't worked through all the proofs yet, but it looks to be highly
applicable.

I hope it's obvious that I didn't mean to patronize *you* with such
a suggestion!  Clearly, you're intimately familiar with the concept,
and any discussion can go straight on to more detailed issues.
I just hope you'll grant me that understanding the concept is pretty
fundamental to any meaningful discussion of information-theoretic
security.

Cool!  So there's a problem to be solved!
