I disagree differently: the driver version is a function of the kernel
version, and the load status can easily be obtained. Therefore I suggest
never printing the version number from in-kernel drivers.
Maybe adding a debug kernel parameter that will cause module loads to be more
verbose for all modules is more reasonable.
