Hmmm, reiserfs_file_write does fault_in_pages_readable after the
transaction is started.  I can at least make the window smaller for now
by moving that before the transaction is started.  The test case looks
like this, they haven't tried yet on ext3, only reiser3
1. in ltp, create runtest/vmmstress1:
mmstress mmstress
mmap1 mmap1
mmap2 mmap2
mmap3 mmap3
mallocstress mallocstress
create runtest/vmmstress2:
mtest01 mtest01 -p85 -w
create dovmmstress.sh:
sar -o /root/results/vmmstress.sar 300 0&
./runalltests.sh -f /home/plars/test/ltp/runtest/vmmstress2 -t72h -l
/root/results/vmmstress2.log -p -q > /root/results/vmmstress2.out&
./runalltests.sh -f /home/plars/test/ltp/runtest/vmmstress1 -t72h -l
/root/results/vmmstress1.log -p -q |tee /root/results/vmmstress1.out
killall -9 sar
killall -9 sadc
2. run dovmmstress.sh

Ugh, ok.  I'm going to start with the smaller reiser patch to move the
prefaulting earlier.
