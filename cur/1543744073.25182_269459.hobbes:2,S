Your workaround is not suitable for the kernel at large. Preventing 
starvation of the system if you are using SCHED_RR threads is up to your 
userspace apps to provide. SCHED_RR is _not_ designed to use 100% of the cpu 
all the time, but to provide minimum latency preempting everything lower 
priority than itself when scheduled. The kernel threads do not need that 
sort of control and can potentially starve critical userspace threads during 
heavy system stress.
