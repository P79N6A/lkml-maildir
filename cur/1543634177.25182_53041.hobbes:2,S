Ok - I`ve been informed (thanks Thomas:) that William Stinson has been
working on removing check_region() for a while now. I was not aware
of this - I have noticed, that in recent changelogs, he has been credited
for work done on code in relation to resource handling, but I did not
see any check_region() stuff in there. At a closer look, I see a couple
of check_region() entries in there. I`ll contact William and see if he could
need assistance, if not I`ll grab another kernel/janitor project :)
cheers for now,
