Otto,
If you are doing development work (or playing with new kernels) and things
like USB failures lock you from keyboard and mouse...
Have you considered telnet into your box from a second machine?  Even a 486
system would do this fine... network cards are cheap.  You could try to
recover the system or at least do a shutdown.
Maybe there are reason you have ruled this out; just making sure you haven't
overlooked a possible prevention solution.

Subject: Linux should better cope with power failure
Lately I had an USB failure, leaving me without any access to my system
since I only use an USB-keyboard/-mouse. All I could do in that
situation was switching power off and on after a few minutes of
inactivity. From the impression I got during the following startup, I
assume Linux (2.4.2, EXT2-filesystem) is not very suited to any power
failiure or manually switching it off. Not even if there wasn't any
activity going on.
