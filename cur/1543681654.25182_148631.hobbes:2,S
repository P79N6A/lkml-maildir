I guess so. Personally, I have not tried the ALSA drivers. However,
from what I heard from my buddy who is also using the same laptop
as I do, the ALSA driver for this soundcard don't work very well if
you play DVD, doesn't work well with swsusp, and it seems to "scratch"
if there is heavy traffic on the NIC. I have been using OSS drivers
for this, and I have not experienced any problems at all.
