Look. I have a boundary-scan probe hardware debugger. I can set
a breakpoint anywhere on my SC520 evaluation board and on the
target which as been in production for 1/2 year. It uses SDRAM
and, as I stated, SDRAM will lose its information as part of
the required initialization sequence. This is not theory. This
is fact.
Your idea of removing the RAM from the board and reading it
from a RAM-reader may actually show some valid data. However,
it is well thown that physical access to a machine or its
components while the power is applied and the machine is
running eliminates any possibility of security anyway.
You just keep the machine on its UPS and carry it away.
The "feds" just compile and install a module to look at
anything they want.
If you want some kind of security, you need to at least
hit the reset button before the feds carry it away.
The normal initialization of SDRAM will wipe out whatever
it has, and you can't get it back on-line without this
sequence.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
