   We still have people needing to find other devices
In particular things like "if on PCI host controller DEV/ID, enable hw
bug workaround foo".  I'm going to need to do crap like this even in
the TG3 driver, it has to be worked around in the TG3 driver code
itself so this isn't a PCI black-list type thing where we swizzle bits
in the PCI host controller registers.
