I have seen older 2.3.x kernels send data out on the wrong interface
even though the interfaces are two different networks, though
connected via the same switch. Ie. I have a 192.168.8.x network for my
gigabit interfaces and a 192.168.9.x for the 100baseT, all going into
the same switch. If I don't disable the 192.168.9.x interface, traffic
seems to migrate to those interfaces even when I explicitly use the
192.168.8.x addresses.
Again, I haven't been ranting over this recently since some of the
kernels I am running are very old (like 2.3.1x).
