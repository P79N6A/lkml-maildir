First of all, please line wrap your emails at 72 chars. Your mail reads
horribly.
Second, what is your question? Yes typically buffer_heads can get
clustered into a request so that contig regions on disk are handed to
the driver as a single request that may contain X buffer_heads. sd
doesn't do this on its own, the block layer does it for the driver. And
it happens for all drivers.
