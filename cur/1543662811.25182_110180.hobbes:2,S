Hi,
	I've got a Hercules Fortissimo III 7.1 :

I use it *only* via the optical output.
Now it seems the alsa driver that's in 2.5 with mute the optical output
until black magic is performed in any alsa-compatible mixer.
Is there any boot option to tell alsa to activate the optical output
automatically ?
The second question is, with the alsa tools present on freshrpms.net and
optical output activated, the only mixer setting that seem to have an
effect is the DAC.
Is there a way to set this knob as the default sound volume (as a kernel
boot option ...) ?
Why is the dac controlling the volume even when I'm reading a CD (i.e.
digital PCM input, digital optical output, what is the DAC doing here) ?
Sorry about the stupid questions, I found lots of material on building
alsa (not really needed now it's in-kernel) but little on how to use
it:(
Regards,
