I brought the RFC patch from several months ago forward
using the implicit stack var in DECLARE_EUI48.
It's quite large, > 300k.
The patches also use single printks for more messages so
that when CONFIG_PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE is set, message
lines won't be split.
I separated the patches into groups where the output is:
1-identical, 2-changed but likely harmless, and 3-other.
In some cases, mac addresses are formatted for use in
/proc and seq_printf either in lower case or with just
a "%x" instead of "%02X", or not colon separated.
It's not good to change those formats.
I'd like to agree on the form before posting.
implicit DECLARE_EUI48; and EUI48(address)
or
explicit DECLARE_EUI48(name) and EUI48(name, address)
Warts:
There are some new non-debug warnings that are generated
when using the stack automatic because some of the debug
printks don't get compiled and you get "unused variable"
warnings.
It's possible to remove the DECLARE_EUI48 completely
by not indirecting the formatting string
"%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X" to "%s" and a function,
but it increases the kernel or module size.
