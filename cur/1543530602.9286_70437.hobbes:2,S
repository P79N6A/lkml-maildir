That's wierd.  It works on my 505tr, and from my .config:
[root@localhost linux]# grep APM .config
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_MULTIPLE_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE is not set
CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT=y
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
[root@localhost linux]# grep ACPI .config
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
[root@localhost linux]# uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 2.3.51 #1 Mon Mar 13 18:03:55 PST 2000 i586
unknown
[root@localhost linux]# apm -v
APM BIOS 1.2 (kernel driver 1.13)
AC on-line, battery charging: 80% (2:24)
[root@localhost linux]# apm -V
apm version 3.0beta9
I can suspend to memory, to disk, and everything works right.
Now, when I suspend, the 3c575 doesn't come back right.. but that's a
different problem!
