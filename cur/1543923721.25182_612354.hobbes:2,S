I agree with your assessment of our current policy remapping with respect 
to the passed nodemask, I think it's troublesome.  Whether we can change 
that now is another question, but the remap certainly doesn't help respect 
the intent of the application and the mempolicies they have set up when 
influenced by an outside entity such as cpusets.
