Did you hit this problem with the stock kernel, or have you been working on
other stuff?
A locked-up SCHED_FIFO process will cause kernel threads all sorts of
problems.  You've hit one instance, but there will be others.  (pdflush
stops working, for one).
The general approach we've taken to this is "don't do that".  Yes, we could
boost lots of kernel threads in the way which this patch does but this
actually takes control *away* from userspace.  Userspace no longer has the
ability to guarantee itself minimum possible latency without getting
preempted by kernel threads.
And yes, giving userspace this minimum-latency capability does imply that
userspace has a responsibility to not 100% starve kernel threads.  It's a
reasonable compromise, I think?
