Subject: [PATCH: NEW SUBARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5.31] support for NCR voyager  (3/4/5xxx series)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch adds SMP (and UP) support for voyager which is an (up to 32 way) 
SMP microchannel non-PC architecture.
The only change since 2.5.31 is that the code will now boot with a non-zero 
boot cpu id (previously current->cpu was being initialised too late).
The patch is in two parts:  The i386 sub-architecture split is separated from 
the addition of the voyager components

You must apply the split diff before applying the voyager one.
These two patches are also available as separate bitkeeper trees (the voyager 
tree is a superset of the arch-split one):
