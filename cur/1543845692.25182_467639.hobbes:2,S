I'll back it out if we don't get a simple resolution. It was just trying to
use the pci facilities as intended.
Note: I know what is causing all the sky2 problems, there is something wrong that
is causing flow control negotiation not to propagate back to all the multiple levels
of the chip. Unclear how to fix it, the documentation is not helpful on this.
If not resolved soon, I'll just force Tx flow control off for now.
