Maybe on that box you can get away with it, but I believe the purpose of 
the check is to weed out BIOSes that have totally broken MCFG tables. I 
think there is some work going on to be able to check and/or bash the 
chipset registers manually on various chipsets to reduce our reliance on 
the BIOS getting this right..
