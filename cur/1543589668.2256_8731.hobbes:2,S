Hi,
There seems to be some kind of a buffering problem in the 2.2.19
kernel. The following sequence of system calls on a nonblocking TCP 
socket (on the client side) generates a broken pipe:
    write(2) 	    HTTP REQUEST	read(2)
2. HTTP client  --------------------> HTTP Server
                    HTTP RESPONSE       write(2)
3. HTTP client <--------------------- HTTP Server
                                        shutdown(2), close(2)
4. HTTP client <--------------------- HTTP Server
    select(2) returns,
    read(2) => broken pipe, HTTP response is lost
5. HTTP client <----X
The client in this situation is a bit sluggish and sometimes does not have
time to read the data before the server has called shutdown and close
(and the client receives a TCP FIN).
The Linux 2.4.3 kernel and Solaris 7 & 8 seem to perform the buffering of
data ok on the client side.
Any ideas or suggestions ( other than upgrade to 2.4 :-) ) ?
Regards, Tomi
