I don't think so because it also does accounting which probably wants to
be precisely on a tick.
Also the timeslice accounting takes the rq lock without disabling interrupt,
and task wakeups can easily happen from interrupt / softirq.
Taking rebalance_tick out of scheduler_tick, and not calling rebalance_tick
from sched_fork is probably a good idea.
After that, it might be acceptable to call rebalance_tick from a tasklet,
although it would be uneeded overhead on small systems. It might be better
to have a special case for your large systems which does the full balance
and runs less frequently in a tasklet (and make your regular rebalance_tick
skip the top level balancing).
