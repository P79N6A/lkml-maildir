I forgot this (even though I implemented it) but you can turn off NCQ by
doing the following.
# echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/device/queue_depth
Can you put the seagate drive under load to verify that it's the samsung
drive's problem not the controller's?

I dunno.  You have much better chance of getting a useful answer by
asking it on a separate thread with proper subject line.  People usualyl
screen threads by subject.  There are just too many message in LKML for
anyone to follow all the message.
Thanks.
