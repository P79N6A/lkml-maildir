On modprobe it says: "__VMALLOC_RESERVE undefined symbol". I'm almost sure is 
an #include thing, but since I know near to nothing about the kernel 
internals, I prefer to revert the patch.
Now I got this problem with vmware but I need a reboot to tell you the exact 
message; if you are interested, I'll report later.
Best regards,
Norberto
