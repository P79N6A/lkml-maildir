Subject: What are the port forwarding tools for 2.2 (and do I need them?)

I've got a little problem that I'm almost sure many other people
have had so I would guess there is a work around...
My home machine has access to a mail server. (My ISP provides it)
my work machine does not (because we're connected directly to UUNet
and don't want to dedicate and administer another machine for mail)
What I figure I could do is set up some sort of port/machine translation
on my box at home which redirects all access to home.machine.com:119
from work.machine.com to isp.machine.com:119 transparently (since the
ISP machine only grants news priviledges to its customer's machines.)
I thought this might be called transparent proxy or port forwarding but
these seems to be tied very closely to masquerading and seem to only
be geared by routing to/from internal machines.  Is that the case or
will it work for routing packages coming in from an external source
(and more specifically a particular external machine(s) and no others.)
What kernel options do I have to compile in and enable in order to do
what I want.  Any configuration examples or even just a URL pointer
to were I could find useful info would be greatly appreciated.
The other thing I'm confused on it that it seems all the ipautofw,
ipportfw
and ipfwadm that I can find information about are used for 2.0.* kernels
and it appears that most of them have been replaced by ipchains (which
I'm
using for masquerading.) for the 2.2 series. But ipchains doesn't seems
to
cover forwarding and proxying.  If ipchains is the 2.2 item for
masquerading,
what are we using as the new ipportfw and ipautofw tools for 2.2?
Thanks for your help,
Jeff Wiegley
