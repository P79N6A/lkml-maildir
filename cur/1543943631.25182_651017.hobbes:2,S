No difference. I just have to do it at some point. I can't work on this
every day and when it comes to kernel, I'm a complete newbie. So things
will take time. If people want that I fix this before mmiotrace goes into
mainline, then so be it.
blktrace, thanks for the hint, I should take a look at that.
