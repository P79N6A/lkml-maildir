from the kernel.org point of view it does make sense but from users
pov i think no. Users stuck with old drivers not actively mantained
would benefit from this.
There are some open drivers wrote by hardware mantainers which will
never get into kernel.org cause of code not following kernel style
guides and so on. Yeah, you should not buy poorly supported hardware
and use bad drivers but a lot of new users have poorly supported
hardware and a "more stable than usual and at fixed dates" release
could enlower the skills barrier in approaching linux.
