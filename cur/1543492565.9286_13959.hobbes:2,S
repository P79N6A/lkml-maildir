couldn't be better to use a something like this???
	if (current->uid  == 0) {
		return 0;
		} else {
		return root_uid;
	}
also that way, maybe, INIT will not start to complain if uid 0 is not
the power/super user...
the BIG BIG problem about this, is that script kiddies will still able
to run exploits and so on.... 
as i say before i'm not a programmer, and my knowledge of C is limited...
but i read the original message and i just thought it could be interesting
to say it..
Flames will be redirected /dev/null :)
