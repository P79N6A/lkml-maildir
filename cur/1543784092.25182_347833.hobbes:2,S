Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/6/248

Two of these patches:
v4l-adds-the-adapter-number-and-i2c-address-to.patch
v4l-allows-clearer-message-prefixes-containing-the-i2c-for-tveeprom_hauppauge_analog.patch
throw great reject storms, due to changes in Linus's current tree.  Greg's
i2c stuff.
I'm not confident that the v4l changes will work without those two patches
and I'm not confident that they'll work against all the i2c changes, so
could you please redo all these patches against current -linus or most
recent -mm, retest and resend?
Thanks.
