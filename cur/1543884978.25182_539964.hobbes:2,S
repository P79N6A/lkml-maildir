We should place that initial branch right after startup_32,
we don't need the startup_paravirt at all now.
ENTRY(startup_32)
#ifdef CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST
        cmpl	$1, 0x23c(%esi)
	je      lguest_init
#endif
...
Although it might make sense to do:
ENTRY(startup_32)
	cmpl	$0, 0x23c(%esi)
        jnz	startup_subarch
To get the branches out of the main flow of execution but
that is minor.  This isn't a performance critical path.
