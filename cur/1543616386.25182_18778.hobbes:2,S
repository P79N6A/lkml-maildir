Ah... so (paraphrasing) -- if you have two byte size volatile objects,
and they happen to end up adjacent in memory, the compiler is
explicitly forbidden from turning an access to one of them into a
wider access -- because that would be an access to both of them, which
is a *different* side effect.  (Certainly that exactly matches the
hardware-centric view of why "volatile" exists.)  And the compiler
isn't allowed to change side effects, including causing them when the
source code didn't ask you to cause them.
So that says that you are indeed entitled to expect the compiler not
to enlarge volatile accesses, neither loads nor stores.  Or, if you
want to be *really* paranoid, you can at least enforce that by
"wrapping" the volatile object, if necessary, with two more volatile
objects that are +1 and -1 address unit away from the one you care
about.  And if the compiler then generates a larger reference, that's
a compiler bug.
Nice.
