I think the patch is safe. Architectures that don't accept
bridge windows (and regular BARs) at bus address 0 already have
that check elsewhere.
For example, in arch/i386/pci/i386.c:pcibios_allocate_bus_resources():
...
			for (idx = PCI_BRIDGE_RESOURCES; idx < PCI_NUM_RESOURCES; idx++) {
				r = &dev->resource[idx];
				if (!r->start)
				    ^^^^^^^^^
					continue;
...
Ivan.
