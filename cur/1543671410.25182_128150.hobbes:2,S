Only neanderthals dual-boot ;-)

Companies relying on DRM are candidates for Darwin awards, IMHO.  However, 
the pure technical challenge of trying to make DRM work for something, 
somehow, sometime might be enough to get decent support on Linux.  I wonder 
if the Quake thing is interesting enough to motivate anyone.  It could be 
advertised as "the only place you'll ever get a fair fight".
Maybe DRM support is a way for some Linux vendor to differentiate themselves. 
Now... DRM in Debian?  Sounds like an oxymoron.  I certainly won't be asking 
for it.

What seems to be missing is the motivation to get exited about it.  Seems to 
me, I've never bought or played a copy-protected CD, or video disk (took a 
pass on the whole video disk thing, didn't regret it) or anything else, and 
it's not because I'm a fanatic about it, it's just that it never made sense.
The whole DRM thing is likely to land with a dull thud and be as forgotten as 
8 track tapes.  It's all just too clunky, and there's nothing in it for the 
consumer.
Regards,
Daniel
