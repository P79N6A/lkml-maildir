Actually, that only depends on whether you decide that Signed-off-by:
reflects authorship.  There's evidence to say that it may not:
1. There can be multiple Signed-off-by: lines in a patch - many of whom
   are not authors of the code.
2. The first Signed-off-by: line may not be the author of the code if
   the author has not added that himself.  It may be a subsystem
   maintainers.
If you don't believe either of those, I suggest you re-read the original
discussions about Signed-off-by: and refresh your memory that, in fact,
all Signed-off-by: is saying is that _someone_ accepts responsibility
for submitting the patch.
If you still don't accept that, here's the actual text in
SubmittingPatches - maybe it's wrong?

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's look at it another way.  Signed-off-by: is a mark of attributation
and authorship.  If someone were to receive an un-signedoff patch but
had the right to pass it on as an open-source patch, according to your
position it would be wrong to add a "Signed-off-by:" line, because that's
like falsely claiming your the author of the code.  And what about all
the other Signed-off-by: lines which are subsequently added by Andrew
and Linus?  Aren't they falsely claiming authorship as well?
Therefore, claiming that Signed-off-by: is a mark of attributation
or authorship is obviously nonsense.
