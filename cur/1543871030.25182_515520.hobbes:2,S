As I said, below the symbol definition, like
int global_var;
EXPORT_SYMBOL(global_var);
int global_function(void)
{
	return 3;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(global_function);

Well, it doesn't have to be in the modular part of the kernel, but some
place later than setup_arch() would be a step in the right direction.
If you need it before the file systems, an arch_initcall() might be
the right place.

Interesting, so what is the intended use of the other core? Does the
hardware have any way of supporting concurrency between the cores,
other than sending interrupts between them?

I just looked again at your code. My question was more directed at whether
you use your own SPI abstraction layer instead of drivers/spi, which
you fortunately don't. The piece I was missing however is the spi_bfin5xx.c
driver, which was not part of this patch, though you seem to rely on it.
Is that already part of the -mm kernel?
