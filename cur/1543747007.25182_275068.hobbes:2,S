Yeah, this is on it's way out now that futexes exist, but KDE (for one) used
to use spinlocks for a thread-pooled malloc (spin-sleep-spin-sleep though,
calling either sched_yield or nanosleep if the lock-grab failed - so it
wasn't a pure busy-wait). It didn't reuse spinlock.h from the kernel, but
it did use the general concept, since the old pre-futex posix mutexes were
crazy-slow for a lock which was heavily used but rarely contended.
