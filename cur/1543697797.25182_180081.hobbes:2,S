That's not a leak, it simply sounds like cache effects.  atime updates
result in journal commits under ext3, and those use at least a couple of
buffers at a time (one for the metadata descriptor block in the journal,
one for the journal commit.)  Those aren't leaks --- they are temporary
use of cache, and once the IO has complete the memory can be immediately
reclaimed by the kernel if it is needed for anything else.
