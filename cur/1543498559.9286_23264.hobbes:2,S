Many people discussed the problems with partition names,
like finding the correct partition , shifting partition IDs
when changing HW configuration , etc.
I have s simple solution for that:
Use partition names.
That is in the partition table/block/area/whatever , don't just mark
the position of a partition , but also put a name there. Like :
disk xxx - size 1000 MB
span(cyls)    size(MB)   type             name
-------------------------------------------------
1-300          300       Linux-native     ROOT1
300-600        600       Linux-native     USR1
600-900        300       Linux-native     ROOT-BAK
900-1000       100       Linux-native     ROOT-EXPERIMENTAL
1000-1200      200       Linux-native     MISC
1200-1300      100       Linux-Swap       SWAP1
Then you can do things like "mount partition USR1 on /usr",
and it would work no matter what controllers you added/removed
from/to the system, what drives you added/removed from/to the system,
no matter how you echanged drives between controllers, 
changed their SCSI-target ID , and no matter what other
partitions you created/deleted on the same disk.
The kernel would read this data when it reads the partitions
and create some entries in /dev/partitions for example.
Some might notice that I "borrowed" the idea from the Amiga line of computers.
I think that at least partially the problems stem from the fact that people
use the ancient DOS partitioning scheme as a starting point.
AFAIK it was "invented" because DOS couldn't handle drives larger
of certain limit. And then it was tweaked to do this and that ...
