I personally want to cluster small SMP OS images because I don't want to
do the process migration crap anywhere except at exec time, it simplifies
a lot.  So I need a second order load balancing term that I can get
from 2 or 4 way smp nodes.  If you are willing to process migration to
handle load imbalances, then you could do uniprocessor only.  I think
the complexity tradeoff is in favor of the small SMP OS clusters, we
already have them.  Process migration is a rats nest.

Yeah, it's possible that you could get something booting in a week but I
think it's a bit harder than that too.  One idea that was kicked around
was to use Jeff's UML work and "boot" multiple UML's on top of a virtual
SMP.  You get things to work there and then do a "port" to real hardware.
Kind of a cool idea if you ask me.
