Subject: [PATCH] ppc32: Fix sleep on old 101 PowerBook

Hi !
A typo in the machine table incorrectly mark the 101 PowerBook as
needing explicit callback from the video driver to enable sleep mode. I
did not implement that mecanism for chipsest older than r128, so we need
to mark this machine as always beeing able to sleep for now.
