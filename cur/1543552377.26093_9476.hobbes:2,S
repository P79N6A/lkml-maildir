Horst,
What you say is correct.  Early comments on gcc-2.96 reflected preprocessor 
changes which made it impossible to compile a kernel.  Later comments, 
particularly David Wragg's "struct itimerval" example, show that compiler 
optimizations is broken.
My recollection is that the behavior of "a[i] = b[i++]" is well defined, 
i.e. in the standard.  However it's been years since I paid attention to 
those details, so I may be wrong.
Anyhow, as we all know, gcc-2.96 is not ready for prime time.
David
