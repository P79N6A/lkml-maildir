The memory controller code currently in -mm seems fine to me,
especially with the changes that got committed over the last
days making reclaim more efficient.
I don't think there are any bugs left that can be found by
code inspection - only the kind of testing that the mainline
kernel gets might shake out more bugs.
I would like to see the memory controller code go into the
mainline kernel ASAP.
