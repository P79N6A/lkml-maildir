mark_page_accessed expects a page struct.  kmem_touch_page takes an
address in the page, converts it to a kernel address and then marks the page.

Yes.  Done.
One other style question.  I am not completely happy with kmem_shrink_slab.
Think that instead of setting the reference bit I should probably do something
like return:
-1	- cache is growing
  0	- slab has inuse objects
  n    - pages were freed
Comments?
