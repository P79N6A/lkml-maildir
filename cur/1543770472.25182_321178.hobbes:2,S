I know nothing about rpc, but this looks completely wrong to me.
Please don't use the ->base directly, use timer_pending(). This
field is never NULL in -mm tree.
Next, timer_pending() == 0 does not mean that del_timer_sync() is
not needed, it may be running on the other CPU.
Looking at the code for the first time, I can guess that RPC_TASK_HAS_TIMER
was invented to indicate when it is safe not to wait for timer
completition. This bit is cleared after ->tk_timeout_fn call in
the timer's handler. After that rpc_run_timer will not touch *task.
