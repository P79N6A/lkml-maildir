No, not fast path. But it can happen a few thousand times. The slab 
implementation failed due to heavy internal fragmentation. If your code 
runs fine with a few thousand users, then there shouldn't be a problem.

For non-NUMA systems, I would use get_free_pages() to allocate a 
multi-page area instead of map_vm_area(). Typically, get_free_pages() is 
backed by large pte memory and map_vm_area() by normal virtual memory.
