I have a non-IBM non-notebook apparently with this problem. It's an Athlon
XP/Via KT266A desktop system with a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz soundcard,
running kernel 2.4.17 with cs46xx as a module and APM compiled in. Sound
became very distorted playing MP3s, rmmod cs46xx followed by modprobe cs46xx
fixed the problem. It's only happened once so far, but I've only had this
machine for two weeks.
I'm afraid cat /proc/apm doesn't seem to reproduce the problem for me
either.
