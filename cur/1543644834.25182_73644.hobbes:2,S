Subject: small patch for power.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings!
 Just a small patch to FIX the FIXME at the top of linux/drivers/base/power.c
 Sending this from here, as apparently Evolution does not operate properly under
2.5.38!  ( i am eblade@blackmagik.dynup.net )
