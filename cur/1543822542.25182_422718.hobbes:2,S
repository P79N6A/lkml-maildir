What's this doing?  If you must use uintXX_t types the kernel already
has them.  Although it would be nicer to use u8, u16, etc.

All of these typedefs are unnecessary.  In the kernel it's strongly
preferred to just do
struct mcp_dma_addr {
	u32 high;
        u32 low;
};
and then use "struct mcp_dma_addr" instead of "mcp_dma_addr_t".
Similarly for enums.  Just use "enum whatever" instead of "whatever_t".
BTW, indentation is busted in these headers too (two spaces instead of a tab).
