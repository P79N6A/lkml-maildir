As I recall the logic with DONTNEED was to mark the mapping of
the page clean so the page didn't need to be swapped out, it could
just be dropped.
That is why they anonymous and the file backed cases differ.
Part of the point is to avoid the case of swapping the pages out if
the application doesn't care what is on them anymore.
