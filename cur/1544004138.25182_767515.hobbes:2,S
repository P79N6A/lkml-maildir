I've got several answers...

This sysfs file is just redundant and could be removed.

There's some support for this already (which implemented in the driver)
but it doesn't distinguish between fast and trickle charging.  It's
useful to know for debugging systems but I wasn't able to convince
myself it was generically useful enough to add to the class ABI,
especially given the existing boolean reporting.

These are a bit tricky with the WM8350 since the chip gives latched edge
notifications of errors but doesn't provide the current status directly.
There is some generic battery health status reporting in the interface
(though not quite so specific) but I wasn't comfortable supporting it
without being able to read back the current status.

On a closer look it appears that started and stopped are already
notified to user space - the driver should be calling
power_supply_changed() when these happen.  Reporting the fast charger
ready status would fall out if a standard interface for polling this
status were implemented.

I'm ambivalent on these ones, especially given that none of the other
health issues are being reported.
