I could not disagree more.  It does _exactly_ the opposite.  It makes the 
code much easier to read but obviously you perceive it differently...  I 
guess it is very much a matter of taste rather than anything else.
For me, black and white is much simpler than shades of grey and whilst you 
can emulate black and white with shades of grey it is still more effort to 
parse than true black and white.
Certainly I refuse to have my booleans (in the kernel or anywhere else) 
converted to 0 and 1 but I am all for unifying to a single boolean type 
across the kernel, so this patch gets a big ACK from me.
Best regards,
