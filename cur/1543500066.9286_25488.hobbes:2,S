Subject: oops if free a locked page

I have a problem with pre-2.3.8-2. It issues an Oops if I attempt to free
a locked page. I think I am allowed to free a locked page without first
unlock it, because if there's a waiter waiting for the page, the waiter
will have just increased the reference count of the page before go to
sleep on the page.
I want to run try_to_free_buffers() with the page locked and so I want to
be allowed to run:
	/* And free the page */
	page->buffers = NULL;
	if (__free_page(page)) {
		buffermem -= PAGE_SIZE;
		return 1;
	}
with the page locked. If try_to_free_buffers() will return 1, then I'll
avoid the unlock, otherwise I'll do the unlock but after a lot of time
(I'll take the page locked just ready for the shrink_mmap-inode path).
Right now I removed the BUG() in free-page.
Comments?
