The Motorola 68331 doesn't have an MMU I'm afraid, so you can't run
"full" linux on it.  uClinux (the port of linux to mmu-less machines)
already has support for the 68331 according to:
	
http://www.uclinux.org/ports/
but unfortunately the links on the left side of the page seem
busted at the momemnt :-(
Anyway, I'd suggest that you look at uClinux.  They also have their own
mailing list.
