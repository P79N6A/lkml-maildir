Somebody suggested a possible PCI BIOS bug and 2.0 kernel being victimized
by this PCI BIOS bug. Note that the 2.0.3X kernels I have ever used didn't
rely on PCI BIOS for configuration access, for _reasons_. I use the
current diff against 2.0.36 on my machines (this is pretty well an hack
and shouldn't work that well on PCI-bogused hardware):

If we assume that the hardware is correct (as your testings seem to
demonstrate), then it may well be the PCI BIOS trying to be clever by
caching PCI configuration accesses and being just wrong at behaving with
hardwired bits.
