It's highly^64 unlikely BUT a possible reason for a task getting stuck 
in try_to_wakeup() is the function adjust_sched_timestamp() which is 
part of the ZAPHOD patch.  This could be tested by removing the if-while 
statement from that function and seeing if that fixes things.  Or you 
could just remove the call from try_to_wake_up().
I'll use a more sensible (bounded) mechanism in the next version of ZAPHOD.
