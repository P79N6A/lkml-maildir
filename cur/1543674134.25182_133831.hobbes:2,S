Trivial, but important.
Somehow in the patching the bk tree somehow got two memset's to clear
new_client in it87_detect, normally while this would be bad, it would
not be critical.
However one of the two happens BEFORE the variable is set, and thus
things go badly.

>OK, fine. You're arguing semantics, though.
"arguing semantics" is not the same as "arguing nomenclature".  My DI
was very good at arguing semantics.  He had this funny idea that an
"unloaded" weapon was one that you had personally inspected and that
the semantic difference mattered.  Something about not wanting to do
the paperwork of one of us killed someone with an unloaded weapon.
Most technical debates are ultimately about semantics, but that
doesn't mean that they are unimportant.
