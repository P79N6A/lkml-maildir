[WARNING: At this point I have pulled an all-nighter, for reasons

probably be my last post in this thread for today, or maybe even
forever.]
Is a 1:1 ratio necessarily the correct one? IOW, maybe alternatives like
the following should be considered (S = stable, ES = extra-stable, EES =
extra-extra-stable):
       | odd/even | ES every 5th | S, ES, EES, ...
---------------------------------------------------
2.6.11 | S        | S            | S
2.6.12 | ES       | S            | ES
2.6.13 | S        | S            | S (align for EES on divisible by 3)
2.6.14 | ES       | S            | ES
2.6.15 | S        | ES           | EES
2.6.16 | ES       | S            | S
2.6.17 | S        | S            | ES
2.6.18 | ES       | S            | EES
2.6.19 | S        | S            | S
2.6.20 | ES       | ES           | ES
2.6.21 | S        | S            | EES
2.6.22 | ES       | S            | S
...
e.g. if odd/even causes too many long releases or other problems like
that, then something like the middle column (every Nth release is
extra-stable, for N >= 3) could be tried.
