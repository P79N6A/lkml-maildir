As a PS to the GPL3 comment here is the basic difference
ROM	-	I can't modify the code on the device
		The creator can't modify the code further on the device
Tivo	-	I can't modify the code on the device
		The owner can modify the code 
One is an implicit limitation of the hardware (just like I can't run
openoffice on a 4MB PC even though the license gives me the right to
try), the other is an artificial restriction.
One case is witholding freedom in the GPL sense by one party while
keeping it themselves, the other is a limitation of the system
inevitably imposed on everyone.
