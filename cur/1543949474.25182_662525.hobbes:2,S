Dave, at least this is needed for TCP packet counter correctness, there 
could be other one hiding still because this only makes fackets_out too 
small (there could be second order effect though), while people are seeing 
a result of too large fackets_out in tcp_mark_head_lost.
It's a bit shame that I didn't notice this when I verified time-seqno 
graphs after that sacktag rewrite (it mostly results just a substle 
difference in the slope).
With this & the debug patch I didn't get anything into my logs but others 
might be more successful if there are other bugs still to solve that 
require more sophisticated network conditions to occur.

[PATCH net-2.6] [TCP]: Must count fack_count also when skipping
It makes fackets_out to grow too slowly compared with the
real write queue.
This shouldn't cause those BUG_TRAP(packets <= tp->packets_out)
to trigger but how knows how such inconsistent fackets_out
affects here and there around TCP when everything is nowadays
assuming accurate fackets_out. So lets see if this silences
them all.
