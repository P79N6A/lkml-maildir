 /proc entries

-* /proc/subchannels
-
-  This entry shows information on a per-subchannel basis.
-
-  The data is ordered in the following way:
-
-  - device number 
-  - subchannel number 
-  - device type/model (if applicable; if not, this is empty) and control unit 
-    type/model
-  - whether the device is in use (i. e. a device driver has requested ownership 
-    and registered an interrupt handler)
-  - path installed mask (PIM), as reflected by last store subchannel
-  - path available mask (PAM), as reflected by last store subchannel
-  - path operational mask (POM), as reflected by last store subchannel
-  - the channel path IDs (CHPIDs)
-
-  All fields are separated by spaces, the chpids are in blocks of four chpids.

-* /proc/irq_count
-
-  This entry counts how many times s390_process_IRQ has been called for each 
-  CPU. This info is in /proc/interrupts on other architectures.
-
-* /proc/chpids
-
-  This entry serves a dual purpose:
- 
-  - show which chpids are currently known to Linux and their status (online,
-    logically offline),
-
-  - toggling known chpids logically online/offline.
-
-  To toggle a known chpid logically offline, do an
-	echo off <chpid> > /proc/chpids
-  <chpid> is interpreted as hex, even if you omit the '0x'.
-  The chpid will be treated by Linux as if it were not online, which can mean 
-  some devices will become unavailable.
-
-  You can toggle a logically offline chpid online again by
-	echo on <chpid> > /proc/chpids
-  If devices became unavailable by toggling the chpid logically offline, they 
-  will become available again after you toggle the chpid online again.
+* For some of the information present in the /proc filesystem in 2.4 (namely,
+  /proc/subchannels and /proc/chpids), see driver-model.txt.
+  Information formerly in /proc/irq_count is now in /proc/interrupts.
