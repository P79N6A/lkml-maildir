The warning is wrong and annoying. It reflects the personal opinion of
Andi and imposes it on everybody else. 
There was and is no consenus about the usefulness of such patches and
probably never will be. It's up to the maintainer of a particular
subsystem to accept or reject such patches.
It's definitely not the decision of a single kernel developer who has
his own definition of checkpatch.pl correctness:

I saw a lot of these warnings, but disregarded them as obviously
silly. I don't have plans to redo all the patches for that.
