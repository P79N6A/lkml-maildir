You can re-initialize mouse with the following command (while mouse is
connected):
        echo -n "reconnect" > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/drvctl
where serioX is serio port your mouse is connected to. You can find out
which one by examining the driver link:
for i in /sys/bus/serio/devices/*; do echo $i: `cat $i/driver/description`; done
You could map this command to a key - given the fact that in pre-2.6 era
one had to switch from X to text console and back to restore the mouse
having a command mapped to a hot-key should be an acceptable workaround
while we searching for a better solution.

When I wrote the patch I thought it would be ok but now I do not think
that the patch is acceptable - it still allows "junk" data into the
kernel and we should find a way to avoid it.
