I get a build error in arch/ia64/kernel/setup.c.
This patch fixes it for SN2 machines, but I don't claim it is Correct.
In fact, I think it is Wrong.
There have been changes to setup_arch(), including, apparently, the
elimination of the cmdline_p argument.  Unforunately, that argument
was not completely purged from the function.
platform_setup on SN2 is #define'd to sn_setup, which still takes
the argument, but does not use it.  So this hack works.  I don't
know about the other IA64s.
I'm not sure exactly what was intended with these changes, so I
haven't attempted a Correct patch.
