Thanks it finally ran to completion. By the way the patch you sent with 
the test suite did not apply so I had to do it manually (booraroom..)

It was not clear whether that would be required or not. This is why 
testing is so critical because if you are having latency issues it 
wouldn't be a problem of getting cpu time since your cpu usage is well 
below the 70% limit.

Since I (finally) have it running at this end at last I'll do some 
benchmarking of my own to see how (lack of) priorities affects 
SCHED_ISO. If it is inadequate, it wont be too difficult to add them to 
the design. The problem with priorities is that once you go over the cpu 
limit everyone suffers equally; but that's a failsafe that you shouldn't 
actually hit in normal usage so it probably doesn't matter... Hmm come 
to think of it, it probably _is_ a good idea to implement priority 
support afterall.
Cheers,
Con
