I wonder if this at some time can be abused by someone plugging in a
purposely mispartitioned device into a machine. The software RAID (raid
0 at least; others probably) drivers at least can be driven into null
pointer dereferences this way; see my earlier mail to the list for
details. In summary: The block layer allows a request beyond the end to
come through to the software RAID driver, which doesn't check if the
access is beyond the end of its device and tries to read some data
structures which don't span that far.
