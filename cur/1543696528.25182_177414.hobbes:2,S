I disabled /dev/mdX Software-RAID5 on two of the boxes that have the
hardware (got 8 of them) and did some preliminary benchmarking using
bonnie++ 1.02b. The hardware is P4-2.4GHz, 1GB RAM (highmem-enabled) wich
4 Maxtor SATA-drives with 200GBs each. The partitions I ran the tests
on are 186GB large.

The performance differences are not that big that they would really
matter. One is better at one direction while the other is better at the
other direction.
I am REALLY happy that a free-as-in-freedom driver exist for the hardware
that has a much more certain future thant a
looks-like-GPL-on-the-first-look-but-one--.o-has-no-source driver. And
the libata code was really nice to read and follow, even though I knew
almost nothing about disk driver. THANK YOU!
