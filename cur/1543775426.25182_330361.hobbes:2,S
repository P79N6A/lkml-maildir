I don't know where the patches are coming from. I have just checked out the
trunk version of the subversion tree from linux1394.org. I will diff it
against the Linux tree that I have here.
Humm, I have just diffed both trees and there is a fair amount of changes
between both versions (i.e., between Linux 2.6.13-rc1 and the trunk tree
from linux1394.org).
The diff (in this order) is at 
http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/bug/,
 if you
can comment on it.
I can provide any other information that is needed. Just let me know what
is desired.
Thank you very much, Rogério.
