Before someone pipes up, _yes_ I do know about RT allocators and such.
No we don't do that in-kernel, other than through reservation mechanisms
like mempool -- and I'd rather extend that than try and get page reclaim
bounded.
Yes, I also know about folks doing RT paging, and no, I'm not wanting to
hear about that either ;-)
