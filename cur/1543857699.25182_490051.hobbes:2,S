You don't get people to use new interface by breaking the
build on them in userspace.
You get them to do it by making suggestions and informing them, not
by forcing them.
That's why 1) you can't get rid of these macros, ever, but 2) you can
warn them by using inline functions and depcrecated attribute tags.
