As I told you in private, I can't see how badly this patch could affect performance.
But then, as you answered, with all anonymous pages added to LRU you see much better
behavior (tons less swapping) on several workloads. That must be due to 
refill_inactive()/shrink_cache() balancing.
The same patch also fixes kswapd excessive CPU consumption on huge
memory box.
Its easy enough to be applied because behaviour is unchanged by default
(you need to change a sysctl value for that).
I would like to understand why does it cause so much improved behaviour
though.

As I said to you in private, please resend.
Thanks!
