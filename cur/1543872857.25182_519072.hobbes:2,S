  Actually, the code is like that certainly for two years :).

  Your analysis seems to be right. But to observe this behaviour you have
to have the file open and just always reread it using the same file
descriptor, don't you? That's probably not too common...

  I also don't know why the condition is there but it's there at least
for two years so I'm not sure anybody remembers ;). Nick, do you have
an idea?
