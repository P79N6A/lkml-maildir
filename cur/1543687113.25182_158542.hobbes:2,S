Hi Anthony,
If you're up for a bit of work, give the "aa" series kernels a try, also
see how 2.6-test goes and be sure to report any problems you encounter.
The VM in stock 2.4 is slow to pick up updates due to being a stable series.
The problems definitely won't get poo-pooed here. Be sure you include a
good description of your workload and probably a log of vmstat 1 to start
with.
