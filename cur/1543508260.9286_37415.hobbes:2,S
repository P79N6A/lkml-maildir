Of course.  This question is way off topic for a kernel list.  But since
you asked, and since the perception among so many is that encrypted loop 
filesystems using absolute block number seeded IVs cannot be backed up and 
restored, I will address it here.  
The most obvious choice is dd.  Example: 
	dd if=/dev/hda6 of=/dev/something 
Where /dev/hda6 is the block device containing ciphertext and /dev/something 
is the device to receive the backup.  If you choose to backup into files, 
beware of 2gig ext2fs file size limitations.
The restore is the inverse:
	dd if=/dev/something of=/dev/hda6.
The caveat is that /dev/hda6 must not be repositioned.  
dd is not the only option.  Any tool which performs a raw image 
dump/restore will do.  Commercial tools such as Norton Ghost, etc, 
come to mind.
As you may infer, it is far better IMHO to associate loop devices with 
block devices rather than files.  Block devices tend to stay in the 
same place on a disk, they don't suffer from 2 gig file size limitations, 
they never contain holes, and so forth.
