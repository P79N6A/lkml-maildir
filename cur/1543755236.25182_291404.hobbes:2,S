Hi,
we are using a server management software that uses the irq information
returned by the SIOCGIFMAP ioctl to correlate network interfaces with
LAN hardware.
The code for SIOCGIFMAP if net/core/dev.c simply returns netdev->irq 
which isn't set by most actual LAN drivers any more, and it seems to
be common opinion that setting netdev->irq is either optional or even 
wrong (
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0407.3/1292.html
).
Consequently, the SIOCGIFMAP ioctl reports bogus IRQ values for most 
hardware; it is therefore unreliable.
Would it be possible to fix the ioctl such that it returns the correct 
irq value, e.g. be using the irq field of the associated struct pci_dev?
If not, I'd consider it better to deprecate netdev->irq officially and 
always return bogus so that people stop using it.
In both cases, the netdev->irq field isn't used anymore; perhaps it 
should be officially deprecated and/or removed?
Regards
Martin
