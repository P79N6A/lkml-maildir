I believe Point-to-Point Protocol only supports point-to-point symmetric
links. Don't think there is any multi-point support in the protocol. IIRC,
PPP also requires a full duplex link, which is not available on an RS-485
link with more than two stations, even if it is a 4-wire link. 
I don't know of an easy way around this fundamental limitation.
Maybe somebody on the kernel list has a suggestion.
Cheers
