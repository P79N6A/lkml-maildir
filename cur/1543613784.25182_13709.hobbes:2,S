Hello,
Done a bit of checking and when the kernel boots, it says it got an
answer from my boot server and my ip is 67.0.0.0.
When I did arp -a on the boot server it said <incomplete> for the mac
address. I did a arp -f and it was fine, booted the javastation which
still got 67.0.0.0 and arp -a showed <incomplete> again.
Very strange!
Bye for Now,
Ian
