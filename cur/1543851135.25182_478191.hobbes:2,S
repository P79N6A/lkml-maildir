Right. This'll be in the next patch submision.

As James pointed out, the pci channel is is not available until the 
reset sequence is done.  The 35 seconds seemed like a reasonable time
to wait for the pci reset to complete; hopefuly it will complete much 
sooner.  If the pci reset fails for some reason, then things are hosed, 
and the sysadmin will need to intervene.

They should be. No one is attempting to free or shut down the driver.

Nex patch submission will be more nested.

Its an unresolved stupidity. For some imagined, hypothetical
reason, it momentarily seemed wise to make pci_channel_io_normal 
be non-zero; but this imagined reason, although vague, did manage
to bite back, as the above code demonstrates.

Should I submit a patch to make pci_channel_io_normal be zero,
or submit a patch to define abnormal_error_state, or both?
Both, probably; I don't have much of an opinion.

Right. I wanted to avoid checking for specific values, 
as that vaguely seemed more robust; the direct check is easier.
I'll change this.
