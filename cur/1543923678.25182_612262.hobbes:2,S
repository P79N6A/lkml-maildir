Yes.  Note that the headers in a later one can 'inherit' from those of an
earlier one simply by #including that earlier one, much like archs do with
asm-generic headers.

Perhaps, but I personally am not in a position to judge what features are
common to what CPUs.  I'll have to let someone from MEI answer that one.  I'll
discuss it with them.

#include is a wonderful thing.

Or it could just be a h/w bug in this particular processor.  I can always
patch it later to change the name.  Whatever it is, I suspect it will always
be controlled implicitly.

Yes.

I realise that, but I haven't been able to get any better names for them.

How so?
