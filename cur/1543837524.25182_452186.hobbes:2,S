This says Linux does use the RTTM "Timestamp" option for TCP; it does
not however tell me HOW it uses it.
So does it stamp the current time in UTC in milliseconds in the field?
Does it stamp in the number of jiffies since boot?  Does it use a
pseudo-randomly generated per-connection initial virtual clock value
with a microsecond-per-tick skew-factor to hide information about the
internal state of the system to avoid attacks on the PRNG to guess TCP
ISNs or attack ASLR?

    new problems waiting out there.
