True enough.  But if you are transmitting bulk data (ie back to back packets), 
which is where zero copy is likely to be especially appealing, you can hide 
the latency by loading (and checksumming) one packet as the previous one is 
still going out on the wire.

Yeah.  I have some half-done patches somewhere to add iovec support to skb's 
for transmit purposes, which I cooked up a while ago with this sort of thing 
in mind.  As it happens one of the projects I am working on at the moment is 
one where zero copy networking in general (though not TCP specifically) would 
be a bonus; I'll try to dig them out again.
