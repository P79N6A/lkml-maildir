start_mem is treated differently in mem_init.  This change appears to have
occurred when e820 support was added to 2.3.x, although it could (possibly)
be BIGMEM-related.
From 2.2.13:
... mem_init(unsigned long start_mem, unsigned long end_mem )
...
	start_mem = PAGE_ALIGN(start_mem);
...
	while (start_mem < end_mem) {
...
		start_mem += PAGE_SIZE;
	}
...
			else if (tmp >= (unsigned long) &__bss_start
				&& tmp < (unsigned long start_mem)
				datapages++;
			else
				reservedpages++;
			continue;
From 2.3.22:
... mem_init(unsigned long start_mem, unsigned long end_mem )
...
	start_mem = PAGE_ALIGN(start_mem);
...
			else if (tmp >= (unsigned long) &__bss_start
				&& tmp < (unsigned long start_mem)
				datapages++;
			else
				reservedpages++;
			continue;
Now datapages and reservedpages are local to mem_init, and used only for a
printk which reports memory to dmesg.  I shall assume that 2.2.13 is
correct, and my patch will include a fix for 2.3.22.
