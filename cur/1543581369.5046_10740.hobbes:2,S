Wish I'd seen this patch about a month and a half before.  I had borrowed two
machines from IBM Denmark for evaluation and their motherboard mounted eepro100
cards (forget which exact chip version it was) didn't quite work with the driver
in the standard RH 6.2.
On boot up it said something about the Receiver lock up bug (only one of the two
messages, I think) and then it locked up anyway half an hour and a couple of
hundred ethernet packets later.  I didn't have time to look really closely at
the source code at the time :/
Just another data point indicating that the current receiver lock up enabling
code isn't good enough on newish chips.
