Well, until we come up with a better design for a zone allocator that
doesn't involve walking lists and polluting the cache all over the place,
it'll be against a single zone.

Fine, then add one to the bounce buffer allocation code, it's all of about
3 lines added.

I never said you didn't.  But Ingo's patch DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST
DEADLOCKS CAUSED BY INTERRUPT ALLOCATIONS.  Heck, it doesn't even fix the
deadlock that started this discussion.  Think about what happens when
your network interfaces start rapidly eating all of the memory kswapd is
freeing.  Also, I haven't posted this patch previously exactly because it
is against a specific kind of deadlock that nobody cares about right now,
plus it touches the core of the page allocator, which isn't nescessarily a
good idea during the 2.4 timeframe.
That said, the reservation concept is generic code, which the bounce
buffer patch most certainly isn't.  It can even be improved to overlap
with the page cache pages in the zone, so it isn't even really "free" ram
as currently implemented.

Re-read the above and reconsider.  The reservation doesn't need to be
permitted until after page_alloc has blocked.  Heck, do a schedule before
attempting to use the reservation.

Atomicity isn't what I care about.  It's about being able to keep memory
around so that certain allocations can proceed, and those pools cannot be
eaten into by other tasks.  Extend the concept a little further, and you
can even reclaim higher order pages by having a reservation outstanding on
that order.  But I'm just dreaming.
