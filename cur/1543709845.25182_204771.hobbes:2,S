I got tied up on other stuff and Marcelo's tree went into -rc mode.  So,
I waited out the next release.  At this point, there is some stuff up
and available for testing.  There are some very minimal patches in the
bk://linux-scsi.bkbits.net/2.4-for-marcelo tree.  The 2.4-drivers tree
is just a clone of the 2.4-for-marcelo tree because I haven't done the
drivers yet.  The 2.4-everything tree includes the io_request_lock
patch, the few patches the io_request_lock patch depended on, the
softirq patch, the mlqueue fixes patch, and some more misc. stuff.  I'm
not done with the 2.4-everything tree, but what I've got so far is now
working for me.  I haven't done much testing yet so caveat emptor.  I'll
make another announcement when I've both A) finished putting everything
in the 2.4-everything tree that I was planning on putting in and B)
completed the audit of the code to make sure the merges were all
successful.  But I know Jens had asked to see the mlqueue patch in
particular, so I figured I would announce that the forward ported
version is in the 2.4-everything tree for people to look at.
The number of pure bugfix patches in the 2.4-for-marcelo tree is
actually pretty small.  The biggest bugfix patch by far is the mlqueue
patch in the 2.4-everything tree, but it depends on a lot of other stuff
so it would be hard to stick it into the 2.4-for-marcelo tree.  Quite a
few of the patches in the 2.4-everything tree are there for performance
reasons only, but they do a pretty good job of making the 2.4 scsi stack
not feel like it's moving at about the same speed as a heavily salted
slug.
