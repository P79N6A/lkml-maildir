That would be a good idea. Its certainly on the list of things wrong with
the old NFS client code. I'm not sure what the status on this is. 
However relying on this behaviour is also wrong. In fact the whole idea of
standard unix permissions is not required NFS just normal NFS. Most people
tend to use procmail to do NFS deliveries. It handles locking/flushing 
issues nicely. It knows that close() can return an error which is something
most apps get wrong over NFS.
As a fix I'd suggest you tell it to use procmail as your delivery agent.
I would think postfix is capable of this as I've yet to meet a good mailer
that isnt.
