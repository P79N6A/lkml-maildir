kernel drm + xfree86 driver will actually provide accelerated opengl 
support in Xwindows albiet without quite as many hardware features as the 
proprietary driver on all the rv2xx chipsets including the 9000 but not 
on the later models. 
kernel drm & radeonfb have been reported to not play very well with each 
other in other venues. vesafb is known to work in this situation though.
