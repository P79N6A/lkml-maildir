I'll have a look.
I think my preferred solution would be to get rid of all the early* 
stuff, and try to arrange to have the PDA set up before C code gets 
run.  For the boot CPU, it really could be done statically (I'm not 
quite sure why the boot CPU's GDT is allocated, given that it already 
has a static one; I think this might have been a Xen-related change?).  
The secondary CPUs could have their GDT+PDA completely allocated and 
initialized in advance, making secondary CPU PDA setup just a matter of 
doing lgdt and setting %gs in head.S, even before hitting C code.
