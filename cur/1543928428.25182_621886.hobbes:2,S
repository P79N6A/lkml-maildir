But the former is currently an empty set.

See, there's your problem.  All interfaces can, and will, change.  You're 
always binding yourself to a particular release.
So you're not proposing we mark what's not stable, you're arguing that we 
create a subset which is stable.
That's an argument we're not (yet) having.
Cheers,
Rusty.
