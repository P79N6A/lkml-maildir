You might want to look at www.eece.unm.edu/faculty/heileman/hash/hash.html
rather than assuming everyone is uninformed. Source-code is provided
for several hashing functions as well as source-code for tests. This
is a relatively old reference although it addresses both the chaos
and fractal methods discussed here, plus chaotic probe strategies
in address hashing.
A fast random number generator is essential to produce meaningful
tests within a reasonable period of time. It is also used within one
of the hashing functions to 'guess' at the direction of displacement
when an insertion slot is not immediately located, as well as the
displacement mechanism for several chaotic methods discussed.
Using your own hash-function as a template for tests of the same
hash-function, as you propose, is unlikely to provide meaningful
results.
