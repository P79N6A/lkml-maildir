I see, what you need to use in timex.h for !CONFIG_NO_HZ is:
#define NTP_INTERVAL_LENGTH ((s64)LATCH * NSEC_PER_SEC) / (s64)CLOCK_TICK_RATE)
this calculates the base length of a clock tick in nsec.
current_tick_length() would only work during boot. If you switch clocks 
later, it would include random adjustments specific to the old clock.
bye, Roman
