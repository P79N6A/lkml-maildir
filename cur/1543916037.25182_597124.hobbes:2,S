Jeff Garzik has been doing a lot of work lately on the ISDN subsystem.
So please check his work to avoid doing the same work twice.
Of benefit for everyone would be a throughfull review of the changes
Jeff made. It is a nice learning expericen if not anything else.
You can find the ISDN change in one of the branches in Jeff's
public treee's at git.kernel.org.
Try also to seach the lkml archives for his work.
All that said I have not chacked if he addressed this specific cleanup.
