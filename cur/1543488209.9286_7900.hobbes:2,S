I am experiencing rather strange behavior with the do_gettimeofday routine
on my intel based pc running 2.0.33. When I make to consecutive calls to the
do_gettimeofday function the last timestamp is smaller than the previous
taken timestamp!!
Here's a code snippet:
  #define DIFF_USEC(low, hi) \
    (1000000L * (hi.tv_sec - low.tv_sec) + (hi.tv_usec - low.tv_usec))
    char buffer[ETH_HLEN+sizeof(short)];
    struct timeval xmitStart, xmitEnd;
    do_gettimeofday(&xmitStart);
       memcpy(buffer, &ethHdr, ETH_HLEN);
       memcpy(buffer+ETH_HLEN, &type, sizeof(short));
       // this sends something over a network interface card
       wrt_transmit_buffer(dev, buffer, sizeof(buffer)); 
    do_gettimeofday(&xmitEnd);
    diff = DIFF_USEC(xmitStart, xmitEnd);
How can diff be negative?
Please let me know if you have an explanation.
Thanks,
  Olaf
P.S. please also e-mail me, since I'm not on the mailing list
