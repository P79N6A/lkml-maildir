Yeah, I shoud have worded it properly - kernel detects the device but it's 
unusable since the driver for it - USBHID wasn't loaded.

I hadn't changed anything (except for the system board which failed recently) 
and it used to work fine - So I didnt suspect hotplug to be the culprit - 
another reason for not considering hotplug was it worked the second time with 
identical setup.
What's funny - I rebuilt hotplug - same version - and it works now! Probably 
it was failing for some reason the first time.
Thanks!
