no, we cannot remove them - asmlinkage is needed for the syscall entry 
(and other entry code) to work, the and the prevent_tail_call works 
around a compiler bug. (which might or might not be fixed in latest gcc 
- but we generally dont remove workarounds unless we are really sure 
it's fine.)
so your patch looks good to me, i've queued it up.
