Keep the kernel configuration test undisplayed when V=1
While compiling external modules with V=1, during the compilation
process, one can see something such as:
make: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.6.18.2'
test -e include/linux/autoconf.h -a -e include/config/auto.conf || (            \
echo;                                                           \
echo "  ERROR: Kernel configuration is invalid.";               \
echo "         include/linux/autoconf.h or include/config/auto.conf are missing.";      \
echo "         Run 'make oldconfig && make prepare' on kernel src to fix it.";  \
echo;                                                           \
/bin/false)
Such a display is quite misleading: it took me a while to understand
that there was in fact no error: it was just the code that tests for
the error that was displayed.
In order for others to not be annoyed by the same thing, I suggest to
simply remove the $(Q) before the test, and to force it to be prefixed
by @.
The drawback is that it violates the rule saying that V=1 should
display every command executed.
