Subject: [PATCH 2.6.28 1/3] PCI-quirks: Unhide MCH5/6 memory controller configuration device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some BIOSes hide 'overflow' device (dev #6) for i82875P/PE chipsets.
The same happens for i82865P/PE. Add a quirk to enable this device.
This allows i82875 EDAC driver to bind to chipset's dev #6 and not
dev #0 as the latter is used by AGP driver.
This is rebased against 2.6.28 vanilla kernel, including trimming
of long lines.
After testing this patch for couple of days on my laptop (i82856P)
it looks like something is resetting device 0 (MCH) config register
0xF4 to zero and effectively disabling the device again. The delay
looks random to me. I can easily update the register using
'hexedit /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:00.0/config' and see
correct values in lspci output afterwards. This is probably
BIOS's fault. This changes nothing as far as i82875P EDAC driver
is concerned as it has the same assumption that BIOS is well behaved.
In case some really broken BIOS is found, this can be wrapped around
some new Kconfig #ifdef.
