And it's even tested successfully :-)
There is an obscure program I wrote a long time ago, which
Michael Bishop spotted, which is in very limited use and doesn't
fall back to MAP_SHARED properly.  But that obscure tool can
be fixed.

That's a bit too far reaching right now.

Corrected?  By that you mean removed?  We have so many hacks
in the tree dealing with this kind of stuff.  For example,
pgprot_noncached() as used by things like snd_pccm_lib_mmap_iomem().
And the uses of that conditionalize with an ifdef, which is how
we get half-implemented interfaces like this which you can't
use consistently, oh and wo' be to the person who defines that
using an inline function and wonders why it never gets ued :-/
