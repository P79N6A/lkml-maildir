Yes, this tree included this broken patch. I have re-created a new tree, now
including Daniel's proper patch instead of my broken one, and one other
bugfix to one of my patches (spotted by Randy Dunlap) which can be pulled
from
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/brodo/pcmcia-fixes-new-2.6.git/
The diffstat and list of changes follows.
Thanks,
