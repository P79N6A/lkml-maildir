Andrew,
I am also seeing some kind of regression on raw in 2.6.0-test5-mm2.
Unfortunately, this happens only with huge database benchmarks.
I still haven't narrowed it down.
So I am planning to do following to address your concerns.
1) I am going to do full code review of DIO & RAW code in -mm tree.
2) I want to test RAW & DIO code with various test cases we have.
	- fsx:
		on  RAW, DIO on files, AIO on RAW, AIO on files, AIO-DIO on files
	- rawiobench
		on  RAW, DIO on files, AIO on RAW, AIO on files, AIO-DIO on files
	- database benchmarks:
		on RAW, on files
	- can I do fsx, rawiobench on NFS files to test DIO on NFS ?
	- What else you would like to see ?
Thanks,
Badari
