Is your keyboard detected as a set2 or set3 keyboard?
Mine is detected as set2, but will also work in set3.  When I get
chance, I'll make a patch to detect it and set set3 automatically.
In the default set2 it emulates a US keyboard - pressing : for
example, generates the make codes for shift, and ;, then the break
codes.  The keys beside the spacebar produce the spacebar make and
break codes, and cannot be used independantly in set2.
I'm curious as to whether set3 is generally supported by Japanese
keyboards, or not, even if they are not detected as set3.
John.
