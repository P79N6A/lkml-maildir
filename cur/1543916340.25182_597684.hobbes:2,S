You'd need be quite masochistic to start such a project. The POSIX timer
API consists mostly of corner cases and I doubt that you get them even
halfway under control in a pure user space implementation.
It would be a rather huge performance penalty as well. You need at least
two user space context switches to get the most simple cases resolved.

True. So there is no point in reinventing the wheel.
