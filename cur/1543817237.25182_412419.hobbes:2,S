Yes, my first response (which I cancelled) mentioned this as a possible
solution.
The global admin could assign certain max privileges to 'container_b'.
The admin in container_b could create container_b.root_t,
container_b.user_t, etc, which would be limited by the container_b
max perms.
Presumably the policy daemon, running in container 0, could accept input
from a socket from container 2, labeled appropriately automatically
ensuring that all types created by the policy in container 2 are
prefixed with container_b, and doing the obvious restrictions.
Or something like that :)
