well the hard balance is between a program that just splits of one
thread and has those 2 threads working closely together (in which case
you want the 2 threads to be together on the same quad in a quad-like
setup) and a program that splits of a thread and has the 2 threads
working basically entirely independent.
Benchmarks are typically of the later kind... but real world
applications ???? The ones I can think of using threads are of the
former kind.
