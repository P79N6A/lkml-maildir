Thanks for your comment. We'll move everything to sysfs. Most of it is
done already, but there is a problematic case I'd like your advice on:
the "info" and "hwinfo" entries, which emit several lines of status
and statistics information.
According to Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt:
"Mixing types, expressing multiple lines of data, and doing fancy
formatting of data is heavily frowned upon. Doing these things may get
you publically humiliated and your code rewritten without notice."
We certainly don't want to risk that. :-)
We have tentatively created an entry in /proc/tty/driver/ as proposed
in LDD3 chapter 18, section "proc and sysfs Handling of TTY Devices"
as a replacement. But that has the drawback of giving us only a
single file per driver as opposed to one or two files per device.
So the driver has to enumerate the devices and concatenate their data,
which appears cumbersome, even though normal users will probably
never connect more than one of these devices.
Is there a better alternative?
Thanks
Tilman
