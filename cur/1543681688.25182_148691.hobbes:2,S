I can do the ov511 work if you want. I can have it done in two days (or 
less).

Yes, at least with ov511. Some of the info that it puts in /proc is no 
longer necessary. However, there are various bits of hardware info that 
still need to get to userspace, for scripts that need to tell otherwise 
identical (same VID/PID/revision) cameras apart when creating /dev nodes.
Is there a convention for naming driver-specific files in /sys? E.g.: 
ov511_foo, _foo, etc...? I don't want to pollute the namespace.

There *is* some debugging stuff I would like to keep, at least for now. 
Approximately half of the bug reports I get are resolved after I see the 
user's /proc info. Is it acceptable to put it all in one file, since it 
isn't meant to be machine-parseable anyway? Some of the HCI drivers do 
that, right?
