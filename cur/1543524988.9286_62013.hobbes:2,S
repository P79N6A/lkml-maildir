I went back and re-tested this issue: Getting SCSI errors from 
interaction between playing CDs and backing up to SCSI tape.
I rebooted the system after the original errors and re-did the
dump backup of 12 GB of files while play music and doing other
things with the CDROM.  No SCSI errors occurred.
Conclusion; the SCSI errors resulted from something that the
libsvga did while I played ldoom on the console.  I guess I
will have to play Doom under X-windows in the future.  I do
not play very many CDs under Linux.  Selections that I like
I convert to MP3 for playing from the hard disk.
