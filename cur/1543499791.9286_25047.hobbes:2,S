I got this message when booting 2.3.7-pre10 (I haven't been booting many
2.3 kernels recently, so it's probably been there for a while):
PCI_IDE: unknown IDE controller on PCI bus 00 device 78, VID=1106, DID=0561
The relevant chip on the motherboard says:
VIA
VT83C561
VA14-1073
include/linux/pci.h says that 1106/0561 is a VIA 82C561.
I guess we need a line in drivers/block/ide-pci.c for this, but I don't
know what all the fields of an ide_pci_device_t mean, or how to find out
what they should be.  I'd be glad to help out.
Tim.
