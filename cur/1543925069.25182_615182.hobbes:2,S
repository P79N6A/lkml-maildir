Something in 2.6.24-rc* seems to be a lot more fussy about this kind
of situation than in 2.6.23.   I have a driver (sata_qstor) that manages
a piece of hardware that unfortunately generates spurious interrupts
regularly.
With 2.6.23, it was only rarely bad enough to cause the "Disabling IRQ #nn"
event to occur.  But in 2.6.24-rc*, it happens almost immediately now
(so, yes, I've gone and put a workaround into the driver for it).
Something's different.
