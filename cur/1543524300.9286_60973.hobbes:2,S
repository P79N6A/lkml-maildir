Rather you can make it handle clustered requests explicitly, or
you can work CURRENT and not care since as long as you do the right
thing you are handling the clustered requests just fine.

You don't need to increase CURRENT->sector, you just need to keep
track of it. I still think we should sector to refer to the current
cluster, but you can always look at CURRENT->b_rsector and b_blocknr
is you want.

You can just handle the entire request your self, and call use
end_that_request_{first,last} appropriately.

Oh but it does! The request function of rd is very simple, but it
does look at current_nr_sectors and lets the ll_rw_blk layer
worry about the clusters.

;) Yes, I suppose I should.
