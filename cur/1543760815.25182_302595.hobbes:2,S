Hello lists,
(please cc me from cpufreq list)
I've since yesterday started using the ondemand governor. Seems to work fine, 
tho I can't seem to find a reason why it keeps scaling my processor speed 
upwards tho the processor use never exceeds 30% (been watching top -d 1). 
I've been using the powernowd daemon and the userspace governor previously, 
which doesn't seem to have this problem, even if i set it at the same 
sampling rates as the ondemand governor.
The settings in /sys/.../ondemand are default.
Any hints?
Thanks.
