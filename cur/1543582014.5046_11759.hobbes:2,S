Since:
1. you see this kind of bug with both 2.2 and the completely
   changed 2.4 VM code  and
2. this bug usually only happens when people have RAM problems,
could you try running memtest86 on that machine to see if it indeed
has memory errors or if the problem is coming from somewhere else ?
thanks,
Rik
