around the time that 2.2 came out I was rebuilding my home machine and as
I was using a large drive I decided to try formatting with 8K block sizes
(as I have never had a system use more then 50% of the inodes) and I
discovered that I could not boot from the drive! I could boot from a
floppy and mount the drive, but not boot from it. As soon as I reformatted
with 4K block size I had no problems. I was using slackware 3.6 and
whatever version of lilo is included with it.

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
