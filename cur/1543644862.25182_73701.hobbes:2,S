I selected fifo_batch=16 and altered writes_starved and read_expires
again.  They made no appreciable difference.
From this I can only conclude that my poor little read was stuck
in the disk for ages while TCQ busily allowed new incoming writes
to bypass already-sent reads.
A dreadful misdesign.  Unless we can control this with barriers,
and if Fujutsu is typical, TCQ is just uncontrollable.  I, for
one, would not turn it on in a pink fit.
