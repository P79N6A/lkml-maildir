Note that enforcing the pairing will be enabled by ARCH code. Is the
construct you show here (two symbols covering identical code) the only
problem you forsee? I don't want to introduce too many macro's to
handle special cases, but this one should be solved.

Some restrictions are introduced, indeed. And I agree that evading the
checking framework by doing things manually should be avoided.
