 OK, here are some more hints on the problem. To rule out the NFS
pathces and pinpoint the time of problem introduction I tested my setup
with 2.4.21 vanilla and 2.4.22 vanilla. With 2.4.21 vanilla everything
works as before/expected. With 2.4.22 vanilla the Ganglia multicasts
are not seen in the system.
 To rule out further causes, I rebuilt the 2.4.21 version of tg3.o
(V1.5) for the 2.4.22 kernel (tg3-V1.6). Unfortunatelly the problem did
not go away, which point into the direction of the pretty large
igmp/multicast changes introduced with 2.4.22. Debugging tg3 would have
been easier ...
 As before - I am pretty keen on getting this fixed. So any hints are
appreciated.
 Just to avoid the obvious - the kernel-configuration for my 2.4.21 and
2.4.22 builds are almost identical (modulo symbols that got
added/removed to/from 2.4.22). The user-space is identical.
Cheers
Martin
