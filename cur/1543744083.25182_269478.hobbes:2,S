hi
I really appreciate your suggestions and as a newcomer eager to learn more 
from you people.
As I said I was able to do printk anywhere in the sched.c (including 
_activate_task ) on a non-smp kernel and on a smp-kernel I can do it only on 
the main schedule() function.
Also, I would like to add that I am not able to do the macro rdtsc() for 
reading the timestamp counter in the same function.When I compile the kernel 
it dosent show any error, but just the printk's and rdtsc()'s get subdued!
Well,  with reference to your reply, I have some basic questions:
1) on a non-smp kernel will the _activate_task not lock the given runqueue?
2) where is the best place I can do the rdtsc() and printk to read the value 
as to when a task is being scheduled for execution, on a SMP kernel?
Please help.
Thanks
Arun
