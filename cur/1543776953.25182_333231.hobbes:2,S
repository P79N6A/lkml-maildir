The path/filename dictates how it is used, so putting relayfs type files
in debugfs is just fine.  debugfs allows any types of files to be there.

Good.

New trees in / are not LSB compliant, hence the reason for writing
securityfs to get rid of /selinux and other LSM filesystems that were
starting to sprout up.

But that's exactly what debugfs is for, to allow data to be dumped out
of the kernel for different usages.

Ok, have a better name for it?  It's simple and easy to understand.

Thanks, didn't realize that.  Wait, all that should be needed is
"relayfs_file_operations", right?  Why have those others exported?
