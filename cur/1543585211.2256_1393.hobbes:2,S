longrun works great, thank you. :-)
But I read this:

   Transmeta, Intel in a battle for notebooks By Michael Kanellos
   Staff Writer, CNET News.com

   comdex LAS VEGAS--Transmeta and Intel will slug it out next year with
   a slew of low-powered chips for notebooks. 
   Comdex 2000: Back to the future In the first quarter of next year,  
   Transmeta announced Monday, it will release version 4.2 of its
   code-morphing software that significantly reduces processor power
   consumption. Code-morphing software is a software layer on top of a
   chip that picks up a number of the duties that would normally be   
   handled by the chip itself and thereby cuts power consumption.  
   "We made a substantial difference (in power consumption) in
   essentially what is the same silicon," Dave Ditzel, Transmeta CEO,
   said Monday in an interview with CNET News.com at the Comdex trade
   show here.
Now I searched www.transmeta.com and can't find a thing about where to
get the upgrade or the tools to perform the upgrade. Are they available
somewhere or is there an eta?
dmesg:
CPU: Processor revision 1.3.1.2, 600 MHz
CPU: Code Morphing Software revision 4.1.4-7-51
CPU: 20000805 23:30 official release 4.1.4#2
CPU: Transmeta(tm) Crusoe(tm) Processor TM5600 stepping 03
I would love to upgrade to version 4.2 :-)
Thanks!
