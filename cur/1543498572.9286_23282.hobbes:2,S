This is exactly where my script is so powerfull because you will
reinstall (I did it quite a few time) EVERYTHING, including your
customisations, in a single step.
(I have two machines, each of them is used to reinstall the other
 one in case of a crash)

It's good for both because the script can be expanded in order to
engrave the customised CD and floppy that enables later press button
install, or what you call large public would go to a shop at the corner
of the street to get the machine reinstalled.
Anyway, I dont expect my script to replace existing installation
programs, just to provide an alternative: Linux provides several
alternative solutions for many main features, and that's one of it's
key qualities.

You're very right :-(
