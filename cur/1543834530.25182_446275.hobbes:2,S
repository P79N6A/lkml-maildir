Those addresses cause 'y' to span a cacheline (P4 = 64 bytes, P2 = 32.)
Even when the kernel aligns to 128 bytes this could happen depending
on how deeply you nest functions.

First, I think you need to define locals in order of decreasing size.
IOW 'x' and 'y' need to be first inside fn(), but that may not work
when things get inlined.  So using the '-malign-double' GCC option,
or forcing alignment with '__attribute__ ((aligned(8)))' for each variable
might be better.
Then you have to make sure the stack is aligned. See
'-mpreferred-stack-boundary'.
I still think the kernel should be aligning the stack to 128 bytes anyway.
