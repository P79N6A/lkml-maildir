See below...
I'll add a new test using yield() and see what that does.

It looks good now! Updated results here:

Compared with more kernels here - a bit more cluttered:

Thanks Ingo!
Does this mean that I'll have to keep doing:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_yield_bug_workaround
Or are you planning on finding a more elegant solution?
# find /proc -name "*workaround*"
/proc/sys/kernel/sched_yield_bug_workaround
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_workaround_signed_windows

Yeah, I thought that was quite suspicious.
- -rc2 is just like -rc1 (see above) so I'll re-test -rc3 first,
git-bisect could take a while with those tests... just wiping the disk
between tests takes about 30mins.

I've tested before with varying timings, but I had not thought of using
a randomized delay.
Will add that too.
Many thanks to you all for the feedback!
