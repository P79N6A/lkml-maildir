Hi,
Apologies if I posted this question to wrong place.
Here's the thing: when loading my module 'a', I want to search modules
list to check if module 'b' is presents, and if it is, initialize my
function pointers to the functions module b has exported. Or at least
search symbols from module b, whatever. The main question is; how to
locate modules 
by name from my module a?
Is this doable? Can anyone give me pointers? 
Sorry for posting such a stupid question, but I didn't run into
satisfactory when searching the archive & many of the functions which
would have resolved this are apparently not exported anymore.
Any comments are really appreciated!
Thanking in advance,
antti
