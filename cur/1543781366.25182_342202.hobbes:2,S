Actually, isn't the fix to all of this to combine Greg and James'
patches?
The Greg one fails in SCSI because we don't have unique class device
names (by convention we use the same name as the device bus_id) and
James' one fails for ttys because the class name isn't unique.  However,
if the link were derived from something like
<class name>:<class device name>
Then is would be unique in both cases.
Unless anyone can think of any more failing cases?
