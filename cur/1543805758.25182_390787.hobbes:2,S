looks like all fs that use simple_fill_super got a root inode with
i_nlink=1 at the start of day.
I've compared with shmem, the nlink is incremented to 2 by a call to
shmem_get_inode, when filling_super.
I've test the following patch with debugfs and securityfs, and its
seems to cure the problem.
------
Fix incorrect nlink of root inode for filesystems that use simple_fill_super
