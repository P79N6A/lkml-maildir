 Perhaps not. Apache's mod-perl was created for machines that would be
running a lot of perl code, so the machine wouldn't have to initalise the
perl interpreter everytime that someone ran a perl script - very handy on a
webserver. It would only make sense, if there were a lot of short scripts
being run. Though, seeing as mod-perl for Apache is there already, why
would the kernel need one ? I'm not sure, but I thought a webserver would
be the only thing that would run a lot of perl...
