I have the LSM for scsi-idle-2.1.62.  It applied
(manually) to 2.2.5 -- had to look at the source
very carefully, though. The author of "take 2"
is not the same as the one you have.  I sent the
diff to the new author, and haven't heard from him....
I have a diff against 2.2.5.  Please write if you'd
like it.
There is also a small deamon that manages the 
timeout operation -- the patch is essentially a new
IOCTL to allow the daemon to control the disk motor.
Regards,
Paul

Title:          scsi-idle - Turn off SCSI disks when idle (Take 2)
Version:        1.3.32
Entered-date:   09OCT95
Description:    A small kernel patch which spins down SCSI-disks after a 
                period of inactivity. 
                scsi-idle can probably be considered to be BETA software now, 
                it works for me and half dozen other people, but YMMV.
