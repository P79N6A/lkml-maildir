Just a quick (and hopefully simple) question...
What is the intended method for utilizing the ide-scsi
emulation code in the kernel? I've gotten it to work
by putting an explicit 'insmod ide-scsi' in /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99local,
but that seems a wee bit brutish to me. There must be a cleaner
method.
Info:
RedHat 6.0, kernel 2.2.5, WD hard drive on IDE primary master,
CD-ROM on secondary master, Iomega ZIP on secondary slave.
