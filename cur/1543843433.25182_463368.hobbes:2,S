Oh yeah, on the send side we also allocate some memory for the netlink
interface if there is a connection error (iscsi_conn_failure ->
iscsi_conn_error). And when that is called from the transmit side we can
change the GFP_ATOMICs to GFP_NOIOs since we have process context.
So I am just saying we need to set that flag in a couple more places (if
you set it in iscsi_conn_error if iscsi_cls_session->swapper is set then
don't worry about it), and that I need to change iscsi_conn_failure and
iscsi_conn_error to take a gfp_t as an argument (or do a in_interrupt or
something) so we can use GFP_NOIO in the transmit code.
