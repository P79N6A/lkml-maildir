What part of my statement are you disagreeing with, here?
I agree distribution divergence is a big issue.  It may be a mostly
insolvable one, too.  It is partially a result of having a long
development cycle.  But even if we had a shorter development cycle,
different distributions have different priorities.  It is a hard
problem.

I do not disagree.
Although, I think there is incentive to get work merged.  It _does_
reduce maintenance.  I think you can see Red Hat merging stuff back.  I
know my employer encourages everything I do to be done openly and get it
merged.  Its a huge benefit to maintenance and QA to get stuff merged.

No where above did I say "you should use a vendor"
In fact, what I did say is "I think users can and should compile their
own kernel if they want.  And as kernel developers, we should facilitate
that."
I merely suggest that users should not expect anything if they go it
there own.  They need to follow the lists and be informed.  Its like me
assuming I can maintain my car without a mechanic and then freaking out
when I did not hear about a service defect.  Actually, a better analogy
may include me knowing nothing about cars, too :)
Marcelo is in a tough spot.  I think Arjan's email (just sent) sums it
up well.  It is not so clear cut.  Personally, I think the ext3 bugs in
2.4.20 are worse than this local ptrace problem (there are other local
issues, too).  I also think some people are skeptical over the
correctness of this patch.
Anyhow, what exactly are we arguing over?
