Thanks. I see that this patch has already been included in pre3-6. - And
it works.
I still need to load the module manually.
Btw. Why doesent the driver work if it is compiled in?

I look forward to a patch :-)

Yes.
After booting with the card inserted, the cardctl reports:
# cardctl status
Socket 0:
  5V CardBus card
  function 0: [busy]
Socket 1:
  no card
# cardctl config
Socket 0:
  Vcc 5.0V  Vpp1 5.0V  Vpp2 5.0V
Socket 1:
  not configured
After removing and inserting cardctl reports:
# cardctl config
Socket 0:
  Vcc 3.3V  Vpp1 3.3V  Vpp2 3.3V
  interface type is "cardbus"
  irq 11 [exclusive] [level]
  function 0:
Socket 1:
  not configured
#cardctl status
Socket 0:
  3.3V CardBus card
  function 0: [ready]
Socket 1:
  no card
If you need more info, just ask and I'll send it to you.
