Well, for this to be usefull, you'd have to split files into two
categories:
1) files that do not change
2) files that can not compromise your security.
I guess that /etc/shadow *has to change*, and it still can compromise
your system security.
Same with basch scripts; you can make bash checksum its script, but
when user modifies his first script, you'll detect system as
"compromised".
I guess it can work... but I don't see how it can work in Linux.
