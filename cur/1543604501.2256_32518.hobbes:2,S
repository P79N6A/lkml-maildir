Just looking through at the spinlock assembly I noticed a few things which I
think are bugs:
 	"js 2f\n" \
 	".section .text.lock,\"ax\"\n" \
 	"2:\t" \
	"cmpb $0,%0\n\t" \
 	"rep;nop\n\t" \
	"jle 2b\n\t" \
 	"jmp 1b\n" \
 	".previous"
We do the cmp loop as a 'soft' check, as the lock operand locks the whole system
bus, stopping the system for a while (as much as 70 cycles, I believe). However,
I don't understand why it was put before the 'rep; nop' which just sets the
processor to wait for a bit. Surely it would be better to test *after* we have
waited, as then we have a better chance of it being correct.
Any comments? Attached is a patch to fix it.
