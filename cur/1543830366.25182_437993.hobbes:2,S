Any benchmarking that involves IA64 idle thread is strongly reccomended
to use "nohalt" option. It's about a 15-20% performance difference
on some interrupt intensive benchmarks (e.g. netperf TCP_RR).
If someone has measured the delta for other architectures that
go into a "low power" state in idle thread, I'd be grateful if
they posted the results or mailed them to me.
thanks,
