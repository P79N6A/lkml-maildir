Subject: mysqld [3.2.23] hangs when key_buffer ~256MB on [2.4.2-ac28+]

I initially upgraded my kernel from 2.4.2-ac5 to 2.4.3 and the first thing I
noticed was that mysqld was stuck.  Killing it left it hanging in a D state.
Then I tried 2.4.2-ac28 (which I am using now), and the got the same result.
My key_buffer was set to 256MB, so I figured maybe it was something to do
with memory usage so I lowered that figured to 128MB and restarted the
system to clear the D state procs.  Everything works fine now.  2.4.2-ac5
did not have issues with the larger key_buffer.
Can anyone reproduce this problem?
