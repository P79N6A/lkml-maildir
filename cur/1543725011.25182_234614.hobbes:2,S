This chipset has buggy IDE DMA.
I maintain several boxes with OSB4 and IDE devices (HD, CDR-W, DVD-RW).
Best solution is using an add-on card (e.g. Promise Ultra66 card).
Otherwise, I found two configurations that always work: multi-device,
and single-device.  In multi-device, operate all devices in PIO -
no exceptions!  In single-device, meaning the other three interfaces
are unused, you can safely enable MW-DMA Mode 2.
