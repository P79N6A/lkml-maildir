Subject: Write throttling problem in 2.4.2?

Dear Developers:
More on my 2.4.2 oopses concerning the "Unable to handle kernel paging
request"
These only take place during ENORMOUS write pressure, and I'm curious
as to whether write throttling is an issue here.  Since this is on 
a reiserfs atop lvm, some of the previously conceived solutions 
may not apply.  
It's not a major problem, as it only occurs I can start a tars transferring 
tens of gigabytes.  But if I also then launch a task doing enormous activity 
on the vfs, such as a simultaneous "du -s ." on the directories in 
question, I can pretty reliably create the kernel paging fault.
Cheers,
Don Barry

-- problem first seen on 256M ram, still persists at 392M ram
