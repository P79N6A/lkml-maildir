So what about:
#define spin_lock_mmio(lock)	spin_lock(lock)
#define spin_unlock_mmio(lock)	do { spin_unlock(lock); mmiowb(); } while (0)
#define spin_lock_mmio_irqsave(lock, flags)	spin_lock_irqsave(lock, flags)
#define spin_unlock_mmio_irqrestore(lock, flags)	do { spin_unlock_irqrestore(lock, flags); mmiowb(); } while (0)
