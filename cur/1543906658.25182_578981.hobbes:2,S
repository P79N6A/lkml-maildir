And could you elaborate on "many"?  What proportion of HID devices
(by volume, model, etc) seem to have problems?
I'd certainly expect there to be some HID devices which misbehave
(I have one, a cheap MacAlly trackball).  Early testing seemed to
indicate such misbehavior was the exception to the rule ... folk
kept disbelieving me when I pointed out some HID devices misbehaved,
since nobody else had seen such a thing!
The specific failure I saw was that the device advertised itself as
supporting remote wakeup, but it couldn't issue that signaling. It
came back from suspend just fine ... but moving or clicking would
not do what it should.
