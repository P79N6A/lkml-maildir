Not exactly. SIGPWR is a "Power Restored" in SYS5 unix such as the NCR
tower.  This is quite a common confusion. 
The way NCR use it for example on the old towers is that the box has
a battery (a big one), when the power goes off it switches to battery
and hibernates. This works well - we've carried machines between floors
without rebooting.
Now when the power comes back on the machine knows the other devices will
have failed, so the SIGPWR causes the I/O coprocessor daemons (hpsiod) to
download firmware again, and it also causes things like vi to refresh the
screen (since the terminals will potentially have lost power).
Its _very_ neat when the power comes back on, and the machine refreshes your
display for you
