I generally put swap in the middle of the disk, not on the
"fastest" end.  The "fast" end is faster for large transfers,
but that isn't what swap is about.
Swap tends to have lots of small transfers now and then, in between
other io.  So you want a short seek from wherever the
access arm is to keep latency down, and the middle of the
disk has short way both from inner and outer tracks.
