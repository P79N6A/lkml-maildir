In short, I can bring up dev eth2 which is a wireless net card 
(orinocco), but if I bring it down, it breaks.  I can't do anything with 
it anymore; I have to reboot before I can use it again.  This didn't 
happen in -test4.  Once in a while in -test4 and below it did break but 
broke differently.  Mail me if you want details on it.
