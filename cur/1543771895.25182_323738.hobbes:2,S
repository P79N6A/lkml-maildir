ISTR, pSeries (IBM), some alpha, some sparc64, and parisc (64-bit) require
use of the IOMMU for *any* DMA. ie IOMMU entries need to be programmed.
Probably want to make a choice to ignore those arches for now
or sort out how to deal with an IOMMU.

Yes, that's perfectly ok. We are no longer in a multitasking env.

PCI requires drivers support Shared IRQs.
A few oddballs might be broken but I expect networking/mass storage
drivers get this right.
