Well, yes, but what is "first"?
Are there any Tulip cards (besides the Comet-2 w/HPNA) that have multiple
MII transceivers?
The Comet2 is a special case, since only one transceiver is powered and
visible at a time.  Polling the other transceiver switches off the
first.

Uhmm, but you don't always know when you have lost link beat.  In some
cases the driver does basic polling to check for duplex changes, but
the semantics are not as clean as you would expect.
