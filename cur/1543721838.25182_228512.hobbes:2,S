A minor correction. We have not contributed much recently (if not counting
few minor patches that have been rejected). However the oldest layers
(until 1996/1997) of the kernel OSS drivers are mostly our work.

It depends on if you are developing just for yourself and few of your
friends. However if you like your work being used by majority of computer
users then it would be a good idea to listen all kind of input. Even
input you don't like to hear.

We will do that in the near future.

).
Lack of organization is good thing in the right place. However lack of
standardization in a wrong place is not good. For example the ls command
cannot be renamed to "dir", "stat", "list-files" or anything else.
Equally well it's going to be usefull to have a standardized command (say
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/scripts/kbuild /my/source/directory) rather
than having different make commands required by each Linux distribution.
Nothing prevents the distribution maintainers from optimizing that command
in a way they like as long as the usage remains the same.
Best regards,
Hannu
