Another case is
#define FLAG1 cpu_to_be32(2)
#define FLAG2 cpu_to_be32(0x400)
	if (packet_header->field & (FLAG1 | FLAG2))
		....
which is a bloody common idiom in net/* and it happens on some pretty hot
paths.  Approaches that would require converting it to something like
	if (be32_to_cpu(packet_header->field) & (FLAG1 | FLAG2))
would be not just obnoxious, they would actually generate worse code.
