I'm not sure what that is, so I'll just supply some more info about
the setup:
* The motherboard is an ASUS P/I-P55T2P4 with Intel 82439HX Triton II,
  bios (Award) version 0207 (the last available).
* The SCSI-adapter is an Adaptec AHA1542CF, BIOS v2.10, (ISA).
* The soundcard is a GUS MAX with 512kB.
* My harddrive is an IDE 6.5GB Seagate Medalist Pro (ST36530A).
