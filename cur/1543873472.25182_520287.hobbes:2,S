(Just for the record, I should note that networking is misdesigned in
similar way; that's why we have eth0 instead of /dev/eth0, and need
special tools to rename network interface. But this mistake dates to
BSD days or something, so we got used to it... and at least you do not
need to keep libnetwork up to date to keep your  net devices working.
So networking provides _ugly_ hardware abstraction, but it provides
it).
