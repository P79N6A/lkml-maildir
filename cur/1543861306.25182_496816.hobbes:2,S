  a couple bits of advice here.  you should start your patch
submission with *only* that descriptive text you want included in the
log, followed by your "Signed-off-by" line, then a line containing
"---".
  *after* that "---" line, and *before* you start the actual patch,
you can add superfluous text, like asking about who the maintainer is,
so that informal dialogue like that doesn't become part of the
permanent patch record.
  in short, your patch should look like:
A patch to switch...
Signed-off-by: ...
---
  i'm not sure who the maintainer is.  can anyone help?
diff --git ...
