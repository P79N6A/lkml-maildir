And what ?
--------------------------------------------------
changing errno. If the implementation needs to use path to
determine the value of name and the implementation does not support
the association of name with the file specified by path, or if the
process did not have appropriate privileges to query the file
specified by path, or path does not exist, pathconf() returns -1
and errno is set to indicate the error.

So this is case is covered.
