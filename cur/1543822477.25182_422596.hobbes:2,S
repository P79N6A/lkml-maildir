Well I know we don't do that.  We have very little data, just board
status information from various places on the board.  LPC does support
doing DMA, which I believe is done in the same way it was done on ISA at
least as far as the software is concerned.  How to implement DMA for LPC
in the FPGA I have no idea.  The LPC specifications would probably tell
you.  I imagine it involves setting up a DMA buffer in RAM (in the first
16MB probably) and then sending a command to the FPGA telling it to do a
DMA transfer from that memory location using the LPC DMA commands.
