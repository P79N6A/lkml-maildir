If I understand you correctly, what you are proposing is equivalent
to how the following currently works:
config MTD
	tristate "Memory Technology Device (MTD) support"
menu "Memory Technology Device (MTD) support"
	depends on MTD
...
endmenu
It seems to me the infrastructure you've provided by kconfig
is completely sufficient -- it's the config frontends that would
require minor updates (xconfig mainly, menuconfig seems to be
working nicely -- at least with the setup I outlined above).
