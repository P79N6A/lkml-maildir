Yes, of course. My point was that if you are "the embedded guy" (like  
I often am) trying to turn something off, the tools show you what to  
look at already. They are currently no help if the option does not  
appear, as you say. So automatically selecting things that are  
required for something is much better than hiding too much. At least  
it is easy to find out why something is selected if you really want  
to turn it off.
If more things worked as Linus suggests, I don't think the tools need  
much in the way of improvement. It really is more about how they are  
used as they are. That is not to say that tools improvements are not  
always welcome, but the current tools seem to work pretty well.
