As for forwarding the data, unless all boot loaders did it, it wouldn't make
a difference--the kernel has to be able to get the data itself.
If you check the archive, you can probably find a posting with a header like
"I've found a system that explodes e820".  I think this is a case.  But even
without such a case in hand, do you really expect all 386 biosen to calmly
recognize int 15-e801 as an unknown function & return with a carry flag set?
BTW, I've also been told there is are problems with e801.  If you check
arch/i386/boot/setup.S, you will see an #ifdef around the e820 & e801 code.
As for the validity of the data, you appear to have followed the sample
code--checking only for an clear cf & for the "SMAP" string in eax.  But
since you are required to pass "SMAP" in edx when you call the code, any
random piece of code which copies edx to eax & returns with the carry flag
clear will pass your test--and presumably give you garbage in place of a
"memory map".  We really need to aggressively test for standards
compliance--except that we know that there will be sloppy implementations
which we will have to accept--IF the user tells us to.
No, I don't expect to survive a bios "randomly walking over memory".  What I
do expect is that at some point in the future, the structure will be
extended to more than 20 bytes.  On the bios code I have seen, the
additional data, which will probably be only a few bytes, will be reported
whether ecx in says there is room for it or not.  ecx is simply blown away
and replaced with the size of the structure.
This extra data, however, is by definition spurious today, so we can ignore
it, so long as we don't overwrite our buffers with it.  Such a condition can
be detected using ecx out, and handled fairly easily.

Actually, it isn't right now.  What *does* happen is that GRUB will
append a "mem=" option to the kernel command-line automatically with
the all the contiguous memory above 1MB.  It walks the SMAP interface
and collects all the memory into one chunk for older kernel interfaces
such as Linux and the *BSDs.
It would be relatively easy to add the "multiboot" boot format to the
Linux kernel, which would forward the full memory map, but I've been
kinda lazy.

Not right now.  Clearly I could have missed something in the testing
that has been done, but it is used by a pretty large community of people
and I'm currently pretty sure there has been no hang reported related
to this.
I'd love to try it on said system if you have one handy.  If nothing else,
it will give me a chance to figure out a workaround not based on #ifdef's,
as, for example, something related to this works fine on MS Windows.

I'm not sure I follow this.  There is some pretty careful checking to make
sure the SMAP interface returned actual data.  It isn't used unless all
those values are correct.  Plus, the MB is allowed to lie about it's memory
in the other interfaces if SMAP is supported.  I've seen systems return
only 32MB, for example, if SMAP is there.
Besides, an accumulated total of memory over 1MB up to the first
chipset hole is always generated and passed to the kernel anyway, in case
it ignores the SMAP info.  This is the value displayed in GRUB's bootup
screen.

The other possibility is to have it simply adaptively try to figure out
how much the BIOS will return, by trying it til the BIOS structures hit
a maximum size.  And have some kind of sane "give up" size.  Maybe add
an "advanced" feature where the user can specify the different probe
size, but NOT require it by default.
But in general, if the BIOS randomly walks over memory (which is what
this would be if I have specifically told it to return only 20 bytes),
this is very bad.

<chuckle>  Sure.
