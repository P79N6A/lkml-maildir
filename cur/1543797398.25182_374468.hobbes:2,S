With Mr. Hemminger's permission, I've started a Hardware WIKI catagory on
the linux-net wiki:   
http://linux-net.osdl.org/index.php/Main_Page
 (bottom of first column)
I plan to add my notes on NICs and motherboards (that I use primarily for
network traffic applications) to this page.  I don't plan to try to make
it exhaustive (though others can contribute, of course).  I do plan to
add notes and work-arounds as I find them...and I seem to have some luck
finding issues since I often stretch the networking side of the hardware...
Thanks,
Ben
