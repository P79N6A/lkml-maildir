I have more information on the problem with bio requests.  I am seeing the bi_size 
value return through bi_end_io early with an odd size if the interface is passed 
an unaligned 4K write.  What's busted here is that bio_add_page accepts the 
4K unaligned write request, then the callback from the SCSI layer calls back 
with a partial compleation with the bi_size field set to the value of 0x1FE (????)
and no other callback is received.  What's busted here is if you use the 
recommended logic of 
if (bio->bi_size)
    return 1;
then you never get the completed callback and the IO request just sits off in left 
field and the driver never returns any error status through the callback interface.
I am also still seeing the disappearing pages and after tracking through the code, 
I am certain they are related since I am not getting any callbacks from the driver 
layer after I receive the first end_io callback with bi_size set.  
Also, my drdos.com address is blocked from posting to the list again, so I am using 
comcast.net.  What's up with this?
