We have found that in the past several months that the LTP version appears
to become "buggier" with each successive release.
From the patches that are coming across this list there are an incredible
number of problems.
After overcoming problems with the compilation, we are getting between 50
and 130 failures on 64 and 32 bit versions which with 20030206 we had on
the order of a dozen.
I have a few questions:
1) Is everyone getting a "large" number of false failures?
2) Are the tests checked out before being released by SourceForge?
3) Are the tests only verified on Intel?  How about PowerPC and iSeries?
4) Is there a version released after the release that has the 205 patches
installed?
Thanks,
