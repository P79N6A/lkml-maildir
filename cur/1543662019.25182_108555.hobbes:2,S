Readahead kills seeks and command overhead at the expense of maybe
transfering data needlessly over the bus and consuming RAM.
AS kills seeks. (At the expense of delaying some IO a tiny bit.)
If unecessary seeks are the main problem, with AS smaller READA is 
possible. If command overhead is a problem, READA needs to be large.
