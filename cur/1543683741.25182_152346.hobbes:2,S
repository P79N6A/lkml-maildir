Subject: 2.6.0-test2-mm1: Can't mount root

I'm using ide=reverse, and my root is on hde5. 2.6.0-test1-mm2 finds my
root fs fine using the init/do_mounts.c patch posted recently.
2.6.0-test2-mm1 (in which said patch seems to have been included),
however, fails on all of the following root= options:
      * 2105
      * /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/part5
      * /dev/hde5
I don't know what to try next. Can someone enlighten me as to what has
been happening lately?
