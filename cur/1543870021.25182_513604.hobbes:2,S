Hi Jiri,
Actually I don't know... Let me test this.
Here is the scenario:
1) If I plug my USB dongle after my system has booted, everything works fine (except that the keyboard repeats a few keys somethimes..)
2) If the dongle is already plugged at boot-time, there is a BUG echo in the dmesg when the bluetooth service fires up.  This make both the mouse and keyboard unresponsive until I finally unplug / replug the dongle hence going back at state 1)
I never run the hid2hci command manually but the bluetooth init script seems to do so.
Quick test:
1- unplug/plug back the dongle to get back to state 1)
The keyboard and mouse do work has expected...
2- Now run the hid2hci command has root
[root@localhost init.d]# hid2hci
Switching device 046d:c70a to HCI mode was successful
Switching device 046d:c70e to HCI mode was successful

So yes, it looks like a hid2hci BUG or kernel BUG initiated by the hid2hci command.
