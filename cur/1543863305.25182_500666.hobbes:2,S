The mentioned Maxtor model (6Yxxx) isn't susceptible to the
large-buffer long completion times, due to architectural differences
and availability of only small buffers.  Any "real" long-completion
flush on this device would, I believe, involve damage to the disk that
hinders the ability to seek, settle, or write.  (e.g. 30-second
flushes are easy to hit if you mount the disk on a shaker-table with
sufficient amplitude)
Later in the thread I think people have pretty much isolated it as not
the disk's problem, but just wanted to point this out.
I assume that large enough customers can buy enterprise-type command
completion ("all commands within X seconds") from most any disk
vendor.  However, these firmwares require much smarter or more active
drivers or block layers, to handle the higher error rate when the data
on the device is valid, but it will take longer than allowed by the
arbitrary enterprise rules.  Most customers who are buying this many
devices have software engineers customizing the drivers or disk
management applications to handle this differing behavior.
