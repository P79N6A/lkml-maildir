I tried Linux 2.4.2
Now I'm in a load of trouble. I can't make a boot-disk to get back
to 2.4.1 because I use initrd for my hard disk modules and the loop
device is broken.
   100     0  1055  1040   9   0    780   780 wait_on_buf D   1  0:00
mount -o loop -t ext2 /tmp/ram /tmp/Ramdisk 
This is gonna be fun. I'll have to make a boot floppy on another machine
that doesn't have a broken loop device.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
