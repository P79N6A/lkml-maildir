The headers should look like:
--- a/arch/cris/kernel/crisksyms.c
+++ a/arch/cris/kernel/crisksyms.c
I don't know how people do that.  One obvious way is to do
cd /usr/src
diff -u linux-orig/arch/cris/kernel/crisksyms.c linux-new/arch/cris/kernel/crisksyms.c
other people probably alter the diff headers.

Sure, but please change it to perform correct error handling first.  And
test that error handling, if you can.  That will involve adding artificial
errors.
