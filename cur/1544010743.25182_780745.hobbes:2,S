afaict, it is a bios issue ... on my thinkpad t60, the bios can be 
configured to covern the clock speed ... there is `thermal mode' option, 
where you can choose something like `full performance' and a `thermal 
optimized' ... i don't remember the full option name, but it is somehow 
named this way ...
on my t60 the cpu was clocked down sometimes in order to keep the cpu 
temperature below 70̊  until i switched to `full performance' ...
hth, tim
