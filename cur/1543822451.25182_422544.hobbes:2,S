in compiler-gcc3.h
#if __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 3
# define __attribute_used__     __attribute__((__used__))
#else
# define __attribute_used__     __attribute__((__unused__))
#endif
and in compiler-gcc4.h
#define __attribute_used__      __attribute__((__used__))
it looks like the pre gcc3.3 version is suited here or I'm misusing the 
__attribute_used__ extension somehow.
