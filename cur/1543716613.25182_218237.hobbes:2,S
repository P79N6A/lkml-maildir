Why? If the device is powered down at runtime via sysfs, then the app that
did that already exists in userspace, like the ones you're trying to
notify via /sbin/hotplug. It would be much simpler for the first app to
generate e.g. a d-bus message to notify other apps, rather than creating
this conduit through the kernel.
Besides, if one process has a device open, then the driver should refuse
any requests to power it down.
And, for the case where a communication device loses signal, you should
treat it similarly to a network device, which notifies userspace of a lost
link, which then has the option of powering down the device and notifying
other processes.
