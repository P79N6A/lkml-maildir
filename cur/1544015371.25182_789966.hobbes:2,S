As already replied off-list, looks good mostly to me. Just have to keep in 
mind, that this version relies on drivers initialising their struct 
led_classdev instances to 0. Maybe it would be better to set the new 
max_brightness to 0 (or to LED_FULL) explicitly for them, as I was doing 
in my v2 of the patch.
Thanks
