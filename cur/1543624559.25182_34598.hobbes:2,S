The scheduler changes try to schedule onto a new true CPU rather than a
sibling first. Typically you only gain 10-30% via the HT feature so you
want to load the "real" CPU's properly.

At the moment HT is Xeon only. Linux can do the right thing with it as of
2.4.18 + acpismp=force. Autodetect should be in soon. I don't know about
Intel's future product plans for HT.
