Hi Alan,
What I am trying to address is not "code patching with INT3", but "code patching
with a 5 bytes JMP". The errata you point to applies to both and kprobes
mechanism already takes care of this with the serialization method you describe.
However, there is a supplemental problem with the fact that a JMP is 5 bytes,
not 1. You are right about saying that overwriting code with any amount of
*int3* does not matter, but what happens when you put one or more 5 bytes long
jumps instead ?
Think about it : if you are replacing 1-2-3 or 4 bytes long instruction and,
unluckily, on any stack of any thread preempted from any CPU, you have a
current instruction pointer pointing at the middle of the region where you want
to put the 5 bytes JMP, the processor will likely trigger an illegal
instruction fault when this particular thread is scheduled back.
