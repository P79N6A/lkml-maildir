From my limited knowledge of SELinux, this is the default today so this
would happen by default.  Anyone with more SELinux experience want to
verify or fix my understanding of this?

Agreed.

Exactly.
I can't think of a "real world" use of moving directory trees around
that this would come up in as a problem.  Maybe a source code control
system might have this issue for the server, but in a second or two
everything would be working again as the new files would be relabled
correctly.
Can anyone else see a problem with this that I'm just being foolish and
missing?
