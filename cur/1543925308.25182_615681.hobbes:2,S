I am just thinking aloud ...
Boot log in the bugzilla shows:
  CPU0: AMD Turion(tm) 64 Mobile ML-34 stepping 02
So it seems that the hardware just dislikes CONFIG_CPU_IDLE.
I haven't dealt with that cpuidle stuff in the past.
Now I am wondering with which platforms that code was verified.
And yes, I know the code was in -mm for a while.
But maybe the test coverage on AMD platforms was not that high?
What about making CONFIG_CPU_IDLE dependent on EXPERIMENTAL for
the time being and remove EXPERIMENTAL when some more testing has
been done?
Regards,
Andreas
