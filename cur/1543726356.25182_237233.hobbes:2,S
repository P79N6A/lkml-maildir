It's not hard to saturate a bus at that speed, but you don't seem to
be getting to that point.
My experience with 3ware cards is that they will happily saturate any
bus you plug them into as long as the drives are fast enough.  On a
machine with a 3w7506-8 card on each of two buses running software
RAID striping across them, both cards will saturate their respective
buses.  (I have a few machines like this.)  I really doubt that the
cards are the root of the issue here.
