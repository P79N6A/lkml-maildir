Yes it is a space efficient version (the resulting binary is usually
300% smaller than the original modules.*map files being used.)  It
achieves these space savings at the expense of flexibility, the binary
is always tied to a specific kernel version.
Embedded and rescue disk distros are using the program, as a replacement
for the hotplug scripts, but the primary purpose is for the program to
live in initramfs and be used as part of the normal kernel boot process.
