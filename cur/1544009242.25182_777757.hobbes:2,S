Hi,
I've meanwhile investigated this issue a little bit further and
changed the subject accordingly.

This was not completely correct. I forgot that the 11.0 installer
saw the drive at least once. And my investigations today showed
that the 11.1rc1 installer / rescue system can run into the same
error. But most often they see the drive (sometimes only after a
power cycle) while initrd didn't succeed at all (looks like a
timing issue).

Some more findings:
After the rescue system booted successfully and detected the
drive, I tried to unload mvsas. modprobe -r mvsas didn't succeed
as the module was still in use, but lsmod didn't report any user.
So I've unloaded mvsas with rmmod -f mvsas which succeeded. After
that, modprobe mvsas was loading the module successfully again
but the above error appeared. I've put up a loop with modprobe -r
/ modprobe but it never succeeded to detect the drive anymore.
My plans for the next days are to attach a SATA drive to one of
the south bridge SATA ports, install an openSUSE system there
which I will use to investigate this issue further, i. e. setup a
build environment to be able to compile the module, activate (and
possibly add additional) debug output and load the module without
having to reboot.
I really hope that someone will drop me some lines to guide me in
investigating this issue. Thanks in advance.
Bye.
