Right. From the earlier conversation I had the impression that this is

That sounds like a long and tedious route to draw out the pain for a 
couple of years and add loads of additional macro definitions all over the 
header files. I'd really like a solution that allows a gradual 
simplification of the macros and that has clear semantics.
So far it seems that I have not even been able to find the definitions for 
the proper behavior of memory barriers.
