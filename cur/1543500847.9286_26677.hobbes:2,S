It makes sense to be able to easily rig up a test bench which is being
used to embarrass us. If we had had such a rig at the time of the
original M$^WMindcraft tests, we could have fixed the problems by the
second test.
Flexibility in the test rig is highly desirable.
I wonder how much effort M$ put into finding a weakness in the
kernel...
