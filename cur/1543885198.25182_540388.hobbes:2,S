But what you're doing now is *worse*, don't you see it? You _think_
that you are not exporting any add_to_list function from scan.c
because you removed the wrapper from scan.h, but then you open-code it
anyway in create_vtbl (yes, that list_add _is_ the *only* meaningful
code in add_to_list; it just so _happens_ that most of its callers
till now also wanted to allocate a ubi_scan_leb too at that time so
you pushed that too into add_to_list rather than do it in the callers
-- via a separate alloc_leb, for example). Now that means there is an
*undocumented* use of the "add to list" _functionality_ outside of
scan.c anyway and which wouldn't even come up if someone tries to
analyse / overhaul the code some day in the future. I know it's just
_one_ exception, but still, I'm a heckler for style.

Well, introducing one more non-static function is *not* what I
originally had in mind (it was proposed only as a temporary measure
till all users of ubi_scan_add_to_list could be updated to use the
other version, explained below).
I actually planned to _replace_ ubi_scan_add_to_list with another
version that does *not* allocate memory (the __ubi_scan_add_to_list I
proposed above), and leave allocation up to its *callers* who
therefore pass a valid ubi_scan_leb to it. But that is where I ran
into ubi_scan_add_used().

Ah, well, forget it. It's all a matter of taste and maintainability. I
guess in the end it needs to be fine with you.
