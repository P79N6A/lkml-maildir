I am an engineering student from India. So please, let the reply
little descriptive.
I recently upgraded to RedHat Linux 7.1, that comes with Kernel 2.4.2, In
that I could find any option for IPv6 support in the Kernel module
recompilation part.
Is it already IPv6 enabled ?, 'cause there were apps (ping, telnet) that
were already v6-enabled. So do I need to recompile for v6 support, In that
case-How? Or is it already v6-enabled...
