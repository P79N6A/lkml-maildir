I do feel an improvement, I get less of those annoying
alsa-bufferunderrun messages popping up from xmms while doing stuff but
it do still happen every now and then, mostly when working with
evolution or mozilla-firebird. 
I actually this has more with memory to do as if I leave computer idle
for a few hours stuff tends to get swapped out. IE 126mb of X is swapped
out and over 100mb of vmware and even almost 100% of firebird.
