Heh, I was trying to figure out a simple way to do that and just
didn't figure out del_timer_sync() would actually have a useful
return value :)
It's probably still good to precise explicitely in the comments
that upon return of cancel_delayed_work(), the work queue might
still be pending and that a flush and whoever called this may
still need a flush_scheduled_work() or flush_workqueue() (provided
it's running in a context where that can sleep)
