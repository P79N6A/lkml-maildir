Just to document things.  The important thing is this quirk happens
before calibrate_delay().  Which is still before the normal pci
subsystem gets initialized.  So that seems to require an early_quirk
as the pci subsystem is not initialized by that point.
The only case we are likely to hit this is kdump because BIOS almost
always boot us on the cpu with apic id  == 0.  However in the case
of this bug if we happen to boot on a cpu with apic id >= 16 we
won't be able to boot the linux kernel either, because calibrate_delay
will fail.
