Because you can't reallocate in-use blocks until the dirty bitmaps have
been committed to disk in a transaction.
What should probably happen is that in ext3_new_block() we should flush
the journal (once!) if we are going to return -ENOSPC and restart
the allocation attempt.
This may be easy (just calling journal_flush()) or it may be more effort,
depending on how the locking looks.  I think journal_flush() is no good,
because by the time ext3_new_block() is called we always have a journal
handle, and I believe journal_flush() will wait for all transactions to
complete -> deadlock.
Maybe something like (just a guess):
+	int flushed = 0;
	:
	:
+repeat:
	/*
	 * First, test whether the goal block is free.
	 */
	:
	:
	/* No space left on the device */
+	if (!flushed && journal->j_committing_transaction) {
+		transaction = journal->j_committing_transaction;
+		log_wait_commit(journal, transaction->t_tid);
+		flushed = 1;
+		goto repeat;
+	}
+
	goto out;
