hm. This is how lapic timer calibration works.
the lapic timer is really simple - it counts down from a value and 
generates an irq if that counter reaches 0. Then it starts counting down 
again.
the 'count down from' value is programmed via __setup_APIC_LVTT().
we first write a 'really large' number into it (1 billion):
        __setup_APIC_LVTT(1000000000);
the unit of counting is '16 system bus cycles'.
i.e. if your system has a system bus of 333 MHz, then a value of 1 
billion takes 48 seconds to count down. (so the calibration ought to be 
pretty robust in this regard.)
then we use the wait_timer_tick() function, which waits until the PIT 
counter reaches 0 (which is attached to the PIT whose frequency we know 
and thus the PIT is already programmed correctly). Hence by calling 
wait_timer_tick() we can generate a delay of one jiffy - and we can read 
out the current lapic timer count and determine the calibration factor.
then we calculate the result as:
        result = (tt1-tt2)*APIC_DIVISOR/LOOPS;
where tt1 is the counter before we start calibration, tt2 is the lapic 
timer counter after we did calibration. (APIC_DIVISOR is 16)
i dont see where the error is - but there must be some calibration 
problem as your system shows a systematic 1:60 difference between 
expected and real lapic timer frequency.
