First, I would think you want the device with ATAPI, not the generic. I
don't use that nomenclature so I may be misreading it. I have used plain
/dev/hdc and had it work.
Second, did you use -scanbus to see which three numbers cdrecord wants
with ide-scsi and try those? You don't want ATAPI in front of it, just
dev=1,0,0 or similar.
