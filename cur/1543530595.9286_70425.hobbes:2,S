Even mlockall() doesn't get you out of overcommit because the
make_pages_present() call in do_mmap will fault all pages in and SIGBUS
your process rather than return -ENOMEM.
There are quite a number of problems with mlockall:
- If there's not enough phsyical memory to satisfy the current process,
you die. No ENOMEM.
- There's a nasty and quite arbitrary hard limit on half of physical
memory.
- Read-only mapped file pages are still counted towards the cache total
(page_cache_size) even though they're not allowed to be paged out. So in
calculations for free memory which take into account cache
(vm_enough_memory), there are more pages counted as freeable than there
really are.
The last point here I think is a bug, and not just choice of semantics,
unless I'm missing some subtlety burried deep in code.
Is there a document somewhere which specifies the exact semantics of
brk/mmap/mlock/nopage?
