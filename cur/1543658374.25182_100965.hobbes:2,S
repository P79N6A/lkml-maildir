There is a project waiting for someone who wants
to contribute. It only slightly involves the kernel,
but is quite useful.
As more people are switching from the Redmond stuff
to Linux, many have "learned" from the Redmond stuff
that `rm` isn't permanent. You can always get it
back from the `wastebasket`.  Of course, the Unix
gurus know you can't. Therefore, it's time for somebody
to put a 'dumpster` in all the Linux file-systems.
Somebody should then modify `rm` and the kernel unlink
to `mv' files to the dumpster directory on the
file-system, instead of really deleting them. Then,
just like the Redmond stuff, a separate program can
be used to clear out the "dumpster" or `mv` them back.
Since sys_unlink() takes only a path-name, there isn't
a current mechanism whereby it could take a flag to
tell it to 'really' delete a file (or is there?). So,
maybe we need a new kernel function? Just hacking existing
utilities won't do the whole thing because we need programs
that delete files to transparently put them into the
dumpster as well.
The wastebasket should be called a hopper or a dumpster so
Redmond doesn't get confused and send lawyers.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
