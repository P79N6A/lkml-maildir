You can find all on

The SKAS3/2.6-v7 was already released, but I probably forgot to announce it. 
So I'm announcing it now.
Changes in SKAS:
* echo 0 > /proc/sysemu on the guests works fine, finally!
Changes in both 2.6.9 and 2.4.27:
they run fine on 2.6.9 host kernels, without hanging at the exit.
Changes in 2.6.9 only:
included a large chunk of JDike tree (excluding all x86_64 related patches), 
and all the latest security patches from Bodo Stroesser; also it includes the 
-V7 skas patch in it.
Actually, however, to do this I had to include big, invasive patches from Jeff 
Dike's tree. I've done it because it's needed and because Bodo Stroesser 
worked with the incrementals very fine.
Changes in 2.4.27 only:
It's based on a fork from the official 2.4.24-1; the patches I've included 
come almost totally from there, but I dropped all the hostfs rewrite. I also 
included some incrementals, the one I thought safe.
Also, you can find on the page the instructions to avoid the "hwclock hang" in 
TT mode. I found the faulty patch, but it needs a more worse bug, which 
affects everyone running in TT mode on a 2.6 host, so it's included. You can 
revert the patch if you want, and if you have to run it on a 2.4 host. I sent 
a message about this about a week ago, but I got no answer.
Distribution:
* the patch are also in split-out form, both web-browsable and tarballed.
* md5sums are available (to test with "md5sum -c *.md5").
Any testing and report is welcome.
Bye
