Hi everyone!
I hope you had an nice and relaxing x-mas and are ready for a nice new 
years eve.
I just have a little question, i really dont if this has ben discussed 
before, but if it
has im really sorry.
Why aint there any stack protectors such as PaX or something similar on 
the Linux
kernel? Couldent it be an idea for the Linux Development Team to create 
something
that will protect against the most known attacks? Im not talking about 
preventling everything
because thats impossible and there will always be some way to trick 
these protectors. But
remove most of the "attacks".
