   One thing that bugs me is that there seem to be a case of copy/paste in
   the kernel wrt compression code :) (there are more than one instance of
   inflate.c in the tree at least)
There is actually only one inflate.c at the moment in the Linux 2.2
tree, although it's #include'd (I know, I know) in two places.  One is
16-bit code used to decompress the kernel, and discarded once the kernel
is loaded, and the other is used after the kernel has come up and is in
32-bit mode, to actually decompress the ramdisk.  I set things up this
way, when I was hacking on the compressed ramdisk code long ago.....
In the Linux 2.4 tree, I'm not sure why Linus decided to use the PKZIP
inflate routines, instead of the one in /usr/src/linux/lib/inflate.c.
The one in lib/inflate.c is certainly much more compact.  It *might* be
that the one in fs/cramfs/inflate is faster, but I'd to see some
benchmarking data before we were to conclude that definitely.
There currently isn't a particularly clean interface to inflate.c, so
other users of compression probably would feel that it's easier to
include their own copy of the decompression code.  Making a clean
interface to inflate to head this sort of thing off would be a good
Linux 2.5 project....

   Couldn't they run cramfs for all the read-only stuff and just use the
   current JFFS for configuration/params ? 
Yes, that's probably the thing to do for now.
