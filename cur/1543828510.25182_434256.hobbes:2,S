It's taking over a second to acquire a write_lock.  A lock which is
unlikely to be held for more than a microsecond anywhere.  That's really
bad, isn't it?  Being on the edge of an NMI watchdog induced system crash
is bad, too.

tree_lock uses write_lock_irq().

Yes, it might also happen with !CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK.  We need to find out
if that's so and if so, why.

I'm assuming that the additional delay in the debug code has worsened the
situation.

I get that impression ;) If it takes 1-2 seconds to get this lock then it
can take five seconds.  a) that's just gross and b) the NMI watchdog will
nuke the box.
Why is it taking so long to get the lock?
Does it happen in non-debug mode?
What do we do about it?
