Not even GCC fully supports C99 (although I think it does support  
that keyword when passed -std=c99 or -std=gnu99), and I suspect that  
a majority of the other compilers for which we would want to add  
support in the kernel headers would not support C99 or would do a  
poor job of handling inline functions.
But my question still stands.  Does anybody actually use any non-GCC  
compiler for userspace in Linux?
Cheers,
