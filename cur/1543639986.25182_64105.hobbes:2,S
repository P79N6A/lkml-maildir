I experienced problems with the sundance on the dfe580tx a while back 
too, and I made a patch for 2.4.18 a while back (it on my site (in the
sig)), donald becker then released v1.08 on his site a while back
(www.scyld.com) which fixed the problem (my patch now includes this). 
Please apply this patch and try again, (or try db's original version).
Fyi, the dfe580tx doesn't support mii-diag afaik. The best error check
was to check the output of ifconfig and see whether the RX bytes
equalled the TX bytes (unless running lo, these shouldn't be the same,
and they were the first time I had a problem).
Hope this helps,
Matt
