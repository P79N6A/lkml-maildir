Nope.
With the patchset applied you get capabilities as default behaviour,
so with_out_ any LSM loaded.

You can load any module to replace capabilities. No race condition
(except that the point in time when the security_ops is actually
 updated is not well defined as there's no locking nor wmb()).
You can also load the capabilities module on top of the default,
but it won't change any behaviour then (other than eating a few
percent performance in some paths).

Why would you want to do this?

True.
