IMO the right thing to do is
	* accept *all* flags from the very beginning
	* check constraints ("CLONE_NEWNS must be accompanied by CLONE_FS")
and either -EINVAL if they are not satisfied or silently force them.
	* for each unimplemented flag check if we corresponding thing
is shared; -EINVAL otherwise.
Then for each flag we care to implement we should replace such check with
actual unsharing - a patch per flag.
CLONE_FS and CLONE_FILES are *definitely* worth implementing and are
trivial to implement.  The only thing we must take care of is doing
all replacements under task_lock, without dropping it between updates.
I would say that CLONE_SIGHAND is also an obvious candidate for adding.
