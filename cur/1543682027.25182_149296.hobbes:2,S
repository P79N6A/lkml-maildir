Hmm, this is now my first day testing out .22-pre6 and .22-pre6aa1 with the 
new I/O stall fixes. At a first look & feel it's very good, but I've noticed 
a side effect (if it can be called so):
VMware4 Workstation
-------------------
2.4.22-pre[6|6aa1]: ~ 1 minute 02 seconds from: Start this virtual machine ...
2.4.22-pre2       : ~          30 seconds from: Start this virtual machine ...
... to start up Windows 2000 Professional completely.
Well, personally I don't care about the slowdown of vmware startup with a VM 
but there may be many other slowdows?!
ciao, Marc
