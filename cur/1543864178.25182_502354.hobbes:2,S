That's going to be tricky, even if they're statically linked, what architecture
do you want them for, etc? Plus some things seem to just refuse to statically
link now (anything with resolver code, though maybe gcc doesn't care).
If we can get the crosstool configs to build all that stuff ourselves,
for any platform, would be more flexible, IMHO.
