Hello
I've been looking on the web, and couldn't really find what i would want...
Basically: is it possible to - one way or another - set variables at kernel boot and read those using userspace utilities?
for instance: i boot my kernel (using any old bootmanager that accepts kernel params)
LILO: linux network=dhcp
and later, in the init scripts, i check the value of this variable using some sort of userspace program, and if it happends to be 'dhcp' i'll invoke the dhcp client. 
Otherwise i'd just give a static address.
I have other uses for this, for instance, you want your disks to be FSCK'ed, but don't wanna boot first, or, don't wanna go in single user mode
LILO: linux dofsck=true
Does something like this exist? Is it implementable in an easy way? (I know a few programming languages, but only little C(++)....)
Thanks
DK
