Hi,
Thanks for the clarification. :-)

Just to recapitulate,
The following changes to the original patch (Alan's patch):
   int ptrace_check_attach(struct task_struct *child, int kill)
   {
           ...
   +      if (!child->task_dumpable)
   +      return -EPERM;
   }
   int access_process_vm(struct task_struct *tsk, unsigned long addr, 
void *buf, int len, int write)
   {
           ...
           /* Worry about races with exit() */
           task_lock(tsk);
           mm = tsk->mm;
   +      if (!tsk->task_dumpable || (&init_mm == mm))
   +                mm = NULL;
           ...
   }
can solve the following side-effects introduced by the original patch:
- /proc/PID/cmdline and /proc/PID/environ are empty for non-dumpable 
process es
  even for root. (ps displays those processes in [] brackets.)
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104807368719299&w=2
- strace started by root cannot ptrace user threads or such non-dumpable 
processes.
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104835339619706&w=2
At least, I have confirmed this on an i386/IA-32 platform. And I have 
checked also
that ptrace/kmod exploits such as isec-ptrace-kmod-exploit.c, ptrace.c, 
km3.c cannot
get root privilege with the changes.
Any comments?
Thanks,
Purna
