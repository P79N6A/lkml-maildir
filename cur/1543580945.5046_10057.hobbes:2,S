This might be a good time to mention Axel has passed maintainership of
Configure.help to myself. I'm currently working to combine Axel's fork
against Linux 2.4.1's Configure.help, which is requiring hand merging
a 260 kbyte diff, so it may be a week or two off.
Anyway, I thought it might be a good idea to update the MAINTAINERS
file to cut the flow of patches to Axel.
