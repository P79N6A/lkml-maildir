We've allowed C++ comments for a longish time as far as I can tell. They 
are very common, all over the tree according to a quick grep. Admittedly 
they are more common in certain driver setups than in "general code", but 
I don't think there is really any reason (other than maintainer 
preferences) to convert one into the other.
