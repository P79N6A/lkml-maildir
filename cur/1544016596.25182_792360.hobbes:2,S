The test system has thousands of disks/LUNs which it writes to
all the time, in addition to a workload which is a real cache pig. 
So any increase in the per LUN overhead directly leads to a lot
more cache misses in the kernel because it increases the working set
there sigificantly.

Just to clarify: the non RT scheduler has never performed well on this
workload (although it seems to get slightly worse too), mostly 
because of log writer starvation.
RT at some point performed significantly better, but then as 
the RT behaviour was improved to be more fair on MP there were signficant
regressions when running under RT.
I wouldn't really advocate to make RT less fair again, it would
be better to just fix the non RT scheduler to perform reasonably. 
Unfortunately the thread above which was supposed to do that
didn't go anywhere.

The released ones all do.
