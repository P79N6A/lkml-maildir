Assuming reentrancy is not a problem, you can eliminate a spinlock
by going from
	spin_lock(&shared_resource_lock);
	vsprintf(buf, ...);
	spin_unlock(&shared_resource_lock);
to
	vsprintf(buf[smp_processor_id()], ...);
The point is you waste space by creating an array of size NR_CPUS
(max numbers of CPUs possible in your kernel) and allow operations
to occur in parallel.  You don't need to spinlock against other CPUs
because each CPU has its own data.
How does this help the printk case?  It allows each vsprintf() call
(required by each printk call) to occur in parallel, and not while
console_lock is held.
