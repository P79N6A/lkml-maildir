Well there is no doubt that there are some unique scenarios where an 
algorithmic setting will not be as good as a single static setting; and 
that's why I put in the option of disabling the auto swappiness. I believe 
our proc settings in the kernel should not need to be adjusted for the 
majority of cases, though.
