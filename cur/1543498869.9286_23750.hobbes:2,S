Same problems here on both  nameservers (they are just cache servers).
Even though  I've limited bind  to use 60Mb  of memory to  prevent any
swapping, the machines still oopses the same way.
Those machines handle  smtp delivery to the outside world  too if that

Kernel is  2.2.9-ac3 (I  think) with icmp  DoS patch  applied.. Debian
with glibc 2.1 (potato)
