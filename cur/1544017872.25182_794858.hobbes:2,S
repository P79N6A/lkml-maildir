Hi, I forgot to mention that I'm running on a crypted disk. So
"init=/bin/bash" fails. But I booted kernel-2.6.29-0.41.rc2.fc11.i686
using "1" as a kernel parameter, and put the laptop to suspend by
# echo -n mem > /sys/power/state
But still, I was not able to resume it - black screen, keyboard dead.
Could it be related to my disk encryption? I though "everybody"
encrypted their laptop these days?
I set it up during installation (full disk encryption, I get prompted
for passphrase as the first thing during boot).
This is my layout:
# df -h

/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00

sunrpc on /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw)
fusectl on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw)
nfsd on /proc/fs/nfsd type nfsd (rw)
I'd be happy to test further - please let me know what info I can provide.
Thanks.
