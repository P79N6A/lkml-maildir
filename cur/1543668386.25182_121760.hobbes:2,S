heh, 16k requests per queue?  Last time I played with 1024 certain popular
benchmarks ran like a bullet.

Would be much appreciated, thanks.

hmm.  I fear that if a SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR task hits this, it will just pick
itself to run again in the schedule() and the box locks up.
A blk_congestion_wait(WRITE, HZ/50) may be better here.  It will send the
caller to sleep until someone puts a write request back, which seems
appropriate.
