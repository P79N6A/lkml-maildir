It's broken, it will crash machines:
       for (i = 0; i < e820.nr_map; i++) {
               unsigned long start, end;
               /* RAM? */
               if (e820.map[i].type != E820_RAM)
                       continue;
               start = PFN_UP(e820.map[i].addr);
               end = PFN_DOWN(e820.map[i].addr + e820.map[i].size);
               if (start >= end)
                       continue;
               if (end > max_pfn)
                       max_pfn = end;
       }
       memory_end = (max_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT);
this will threat non-RAM holes as RAM. On 2.4.x we do a different things, that
is we collect the max_pfn but then we don't assume that there are no holes
between 1M and max_pfn ;), we instead fill the bootmem allocator _only_ with
E820_RAM segments.
I was in the process of fixing this (I also just backported the thinkpad
%edx clobber fix), but if somebody is going to work on this please let
me know so we stay in sync.

I dislike the implementation. I stick with my faster and nicer implementation
that was just included in aa kernels for some time (2.2.18aa2 included it for
example). Andrew, I guess you didn't noticed I just implemented the wakeone for
accept. (I just ported it on top of 2.2.19pre2 after backing out the wakeone in
pre2)
