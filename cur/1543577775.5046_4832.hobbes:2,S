Anyone get this working? If so please tell me the version of you APM utilities
and what Power Management options you have on in the kernel.
Ever since I started trying 2.3.x, as soon as the box gets a change in it's
power status (even just an update of the % battery) Linux locks solid. It's 100%
repeatable.
In particular this is a Compaq Presario 1670. If I remove APM from the kernel it
runs perfectly... but no APM on a laptop really sucks.
