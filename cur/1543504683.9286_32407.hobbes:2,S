The "unix way" to do this is to run a program at shutdown that does
this. Conveniently all distributions have a sysv-init setup that
allows this.
Indeed all it needs are the ioctls that allow it to read the current
settings. If you run "xmix" you can see it read the current state from
the driver, as it moves the sliders when another application changes
them.
I even think that OSS comes with an application to do this.
