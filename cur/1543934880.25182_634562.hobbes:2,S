Agreed.  We're happy here, for now.

That was with a UP kernel on a UP box.
The latency thingie really seemed to have little or no effect,
whereas setting max_cstate=1 has a quite noticeable positive impact.
Things seemed okay (with the latency thingie) on the SMP machine,
but with two cores it is probably simply more forgiving.
