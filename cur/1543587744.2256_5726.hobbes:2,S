You just illustrated my point.  While there is a reset capability
people will use it and accounting/logging programs will get wrong
data.  Resetable counters might be a minor convenience when debugging
but the price is unreliable programs and the loss of the ability of
several programs to use the same counters.
Also, do you always reset the date and time everytime you make time 
measurements?
