How is that different from arranging some struct foo? Either you need a 
reference object anyway or a NULL pointer works in both cases.

If it were a common operation, this might have some value...

In SETUP_TIMER.

I admit the compile check in SETUP_TIMER() is clever, but this way all the
magic is in this place and is it really worth it? You're only adding _one_ 
extra typecheck for mostly simple cases anyway.
The container_of() method is not new and is already well used in other 
places, it has real practical advantages, which would make the change 
actually worthwile.
