Here's the /proc/interrupts dump:

I'm not sure about IRQ balancing sorry. How do I tell? The entire boot 
process output is here:
http://robm.fastmail.fm/kernel/t7/bootdmesg.txt
And the config is here:
http://robm.fastmail.fm/kernel/t7/config.txt
Does that help?
Our boot doesn't pass any special parameters, just choosing the deadline 
elevator...
image=/boot/bzImage-2.6.12.2
  label=linux-2.6.12.2
  append="elevator=deadline"
  read-only
  root=/dev/sda2
Thanks for your help!
Rob
