I posted some numbers with traditional iSCSI on Neterion Xframe I 10
Gb/sec with LRO back in 2005 with disktest on the 1st generation x86_64
hardware available at the time.  These tests where designed to show the
performance advantages of internexus multiplexing that is available
within traditional iSCSI, as well as iSER.
The disktest parameters that I used are listed in the following thread:
