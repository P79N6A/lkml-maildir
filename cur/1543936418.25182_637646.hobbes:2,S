My reaction is that the intent of these warnings is to try to get people
to fix broken applications, so I'm not sure any action is appropriate;
however, it's Doug's driver, so I'll defer to him.
Even if he does say yes, though, your patch looks wrong.  It's still
going to spew the 
printk: 1078 messages suppressed.
to the log because they come from printk_ratelimit().  So all you've
done is halved the volume of flow to the logs and left a dangling printk
suppressed message that keeps spewing, so I don't think the patch even
does what you describe it as doing ...  if you reverse the order of the
operands in the if() it will ...
