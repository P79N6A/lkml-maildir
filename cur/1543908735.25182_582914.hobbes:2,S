If communicating among CPUs, sure.  However, when communicating between
mainline and interrupt/NMI handlers on the same CPU, the barrier() and
most expecially the *mb() macros are gross overkill.  So there really
truly is a place for volatile -- not a large place, to be sure, but a
place nonetheless.
