Well, it needs to also handle backup superblock, bitmaps, inode table:
	if (ext3_bg_has_super())
		ext3_set_bit(0, gdp_bh->b_data);
	gdblocks = ext3_bg_num_gdb(sb, group);
	for (i = 0, bit = 1; i < gdblocks; i++, bit++)
		/* actually a bit more complex for INCOMPAT_META_BG fs */
		ext3_set_bit(i, gdp_bh->b_data);
	ext3_set_bit(gdp->bg_inode_bitmap % EXT3_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb), ...);
	ext3_set_bit(gdp->bg_block_bitmap % EXT3_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb), ...);
	for (i = 0, bit = gdp->bg_inode_table % EXT3_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb);
	     i < EXT3_SB(sb)->s_itb_per_group; i++, bit++)
		ext3_set_bit(i, gdp_bh->b_data);
		
(or something close to this).
Cheers, Andreas
