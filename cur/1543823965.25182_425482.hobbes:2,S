Well, this really isn't quite right.  There are 32 bit platforms which
will refuse a 64 bit DMA mask on principle.  You need to retry with a 32
bit mask before erroring out, exactly like you've done in megaraid_sas.c
Also, it's a bit strange having a 32 bit mask set initially in probe_one
and then being reset in init_mbox.  Why not just consolidate all the PCI
register testing and mask setting in probe_one?
