Actually, given that it also appears with gcc 3.3, I'd like to request
that the change (along with all the other const __devinitdata's) are
backed out.
The comments I'm hearing about gcc 4.1 on ARM indicate that it's a case
of "there be big beasts there, don't touch with a barge pole".  To quote
some comments about gcc 4.1 on ARM:
"yeah, 4.1 is quite bad on arm.  it's supposed to have all the EABI bits,
 but it can't even build itself without ICEing and segfaulting left right
 and center"
"the debian arm failures with gcc 4.1 are just scary.  the current gcc
 4.1s miscompile even very basic for/while loops"
which probably leaves ARM folk with a very narrow set of working gcc
versions.
So, I've no idea at present which gcc version we should be considering
nominating as "the sole gcc version the kernel supports".
