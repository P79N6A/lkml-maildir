Hi,
I think this is a bug although of course it might be a case of us simply
not supporting this.
mount -o remount,ro /some/loopfile/based/mount
I get
ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: Device or resource busy
This is of course a lie - I only just mounted it! This causes problems at
shutdown - since I am mounting over /lib, the fs can't be unmounted. Being
able to remount r/o would prevent several fsck's due to unclean
unmounting. The loopfile itself is on /usr.
Cheers
Chris
