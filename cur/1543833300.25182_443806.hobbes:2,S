glibc still works, just slower. But I think the best strategy 
is just to emulate the single sysctl glibc is using and printk
for the rest.

We did this some time ago, but Andrew took it out (partly because
the original code was somewhat broken and the printk tended to trigger
too often in crashme) 
Hopefully he puts it back in now.

The numerical namespace for sysctl is unsalvagable imho. e.g. distributions
regularly break it because there is no central repository of numbers
so it's not very usable anyways in practice.
