No such thing.  It's not the matter of having a syscall to extract such
identifier - it's that on a lot of filesystems (including many common Unix
ones) there's nothing that would qualify.
Note that tar et.al. do not behave well if used on actively modified directory
tree and ->st_ino reuse is the least of the problems in that area.
