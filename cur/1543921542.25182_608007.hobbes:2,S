Of course, for the same reason. If you reduce the ip_local_port_range, it
will even succeed more often. This is because the source port is choosen
before the first packet is sent, so when it is sent, it reaches a pending
connection (itself).
I can understand that it is confusing when you see it as a single
connection, but try to imagine (or reproduce) with 2 machines, then
translate that to the localhost with a single and same connection.
You may even draw the exchanges on paper, an you will notice that
"each end" of the connection gets its SYN-SYN/ACK-ACK sequence.
You may also tcpdump on loopback if that helps.

Willy
