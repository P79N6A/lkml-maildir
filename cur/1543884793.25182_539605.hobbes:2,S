No, I don't think so. Your points were:
1) You did not want to adjust your legacy keymap on Amiga
2) You want userspace programs to know how to program scancodes for
every type of keyboard and have different keymaps for different type
of keyboards (So you need to have n_kbd_types *
n_international_mappings keymaps).
Answering 1) I sent you once a patch for review that would have amikbd
send raw scancode events in additional to standard input events and
drivers/char/keyboard.c pick these raw events on amiga so both legacy
driver and evdev could work, but I never heard from you.
As far as 2) goes I think it is better to have unified keyboard map
across different types of keyboards and then overlay
internatinalization/other settings. And you still have per-keyboard
configurability as you can change scancode->keycode mapping on a
per-device basis via evdev ioctl.
