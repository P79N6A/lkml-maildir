Nope.  Maybe you misunderstood.  In my /etc/modules.conf, I have
alias sound-service-0-0 es1370
From what you said in the last message, this should be sound.  Unless I
misunderstood.

Agreed, I don't believe I've ever had a module named 'sound.o' that took
care of the actual hardware.  I believe it was 2.0.x that you load sb.o and
that was it.  I do like the way the sound modules were done in 2.2.x  (altho
someone I know seems to not like something about it as a module and compiles
it in)

Like I did <g>

My primary card is pci, the secondary is isa.  they both live happily
together on the same mobo
