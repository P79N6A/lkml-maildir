OK.

OK.

Even 48MB/s is quite low.
I've reached up to 70MB/s with a single 500GB Seagate model and even my older HDDs all reach 60MB/s (at least on the outer cylinders)
But i haven't tested any "sync/fsync" in between, only after.

OK. That appears to be a serious constraint.
Do HDDs cope well with zero gravity?
At least the SSD won't have a problem with that. ;-)

Personally i haven't had such bad write speeds in years. Taking USB connected and/or encrypted partitions aside.
But on the other hand: I don't sync(fsync) until i have to.
And personally i have good (and constant bandwidth) experience using XFS as a filesystem.
(I have 41 HDDs with a total capacity of 10.5 TB, performance is quite important for me.)
Also you have skipped the information how the images "arrive" on the system (PCI(e) card?), that may be important for an "end to end" view of the problem.
And what's also missing. What is "a long period of time".
Calculating best-case with the SSD:
27GB divided by 30MB/s only gives a bit more than 15 Minutes.
And worst case with 50MB/s is less than 10 Minutes.
