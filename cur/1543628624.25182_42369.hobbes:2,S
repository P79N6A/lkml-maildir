   Ok. I think NETIF_F_VLAN_CHALLENGED should be set if the device or
   driver can handle VLAN.
No, "challenged" means "cannot handle".  Do not invert the meaning,
the macro says what the meaning is.
To get the behavior you want, we set the flat by default and drivers
for devices which are deemed "VLAN capable" can set the bit
themselves.
