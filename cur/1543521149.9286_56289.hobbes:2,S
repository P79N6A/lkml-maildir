Are you just blind to the neverending format/compatiblity/parsing/performance
problems the whole idea behing /proc induces inherently?
Oh yes they don't turn up that frequently anylonger, since
everybody learned in the time between don't touching anything there
like a heap of shit. Instead of changing something, one leaves the 
broken /proc interface where it is and adds just another new file 
(or even dir) there.
My favorite examples for how broken they are
/proc/stat 	-- the information there is entierly *broken* misleading and
		   incomplete. (leftover from early days.)
/proc/pci   	-- static data continuously reconstructed on the fly.
		   (binary to string and then back string to binray in userland...)
		   And now (2.3.xx) it's event binary only...
/proc/cpuinfo   -- same here static data. uname is since the beginnging
		   the proper interface for this stuff.
/proc/ksyms 	-- entierly redundant and not used by the modutils.
/proc/modules   -- entierly redundant to the module syscalls. *Not* used by
lsmod.
/proc/version	-- entierly static data with no apparent value
/proc/kmsg	-- entierly redundant to syslog.
One could continue with no end...

Wonderfull!!!! The same data twice, albeit no one of them easly
parsed! Easly parsed? By what? AWK? SED? or should the procps
utilities beeing implemented in damn PERL? (Some loosers who
don't know C would apreciate this, certainly) !!!!!
The only thing I'm missing is adding floating point
formats to this...
And then there is the phenomenon of proliferation of /proc items.
Just an example...
root:/proc/ide# find /proc/ide
/proc/ide
/proc/ide/drivers
/proc/ide/hdd
/proc/ide/ide1
/proc/ide/ide1/hdd
/proc/ide/ide1/hdd/capacity

Hell only God know's what they are good for!
And there is no userland tool for this. This is the
last thing Mark Lord added before ditching ide developement.
root:/proc/sys# find /proc/sys | wc
    208     208    7305
Don't tell me any sane admit will fiddle with ALL this...
And in esp. any sane system doesn't need this degree of
pseudo configuration flexibility.

Yes reading files, walking dirtrees and parsig them is indeed
very very time consuming. I would like to know how well this design
will scale to an enterprise server with 32 CPU and X*10000 concurrent processes:
	user:~/mysweethome:
	Message from root@localhost to user@localhost resived... BLAH BLAH:
	"Please stop any intensive intermittient computational activity.
	 Due to maintainance work I'm going to run ps auxw int 5 minutes.
	 Thank's in advance for your understanding!
	 You's sincerly:
	 root@localhost"
Oh don't tell me procps could have been
done better, there where years of time for this and apparently
nobody managed to get it right for practical reaons..
I think you don't write enough user-land code... (just a guess)
go and just compare for example the ps/netstat utlities
from *BSD just too see  WHY /proc as it is, is a BAD design :-).
Maybe it appears cute as an idea to have something like this, but
in practice something like this is inevitable 
going to result in a coding mess in esp. in an such uncoordinated
effort like Linux.
And I didn't even tell a word about the bloat/mess/races inside the kernel
code caused by this all...
Really man sysctl *is* much much saner and what should be
"depricated" is /proc
