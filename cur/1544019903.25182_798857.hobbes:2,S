hm, I'm a bit surprised to see the drm code using `struct
address_space' and read_mapping_page() and unmap_mapping_range() and
such.  I thought those only worked with regular files and pagecache :)
Is it possible to briefly explain what's going on there?
What instance of address_space_operations does ->dev_mapping actually
point at?
