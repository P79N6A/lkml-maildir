Subject: cramfs initrd functionality for 2.6?

Anyone have plans to port the cramfs initrd feature from 2.4.22 into the 
2.6 series? I tried porting the (trivial looking) patches myself, even 
getting as far as the cramfs being recognised and the ramdisk filled, 
but ultimately lack of C and kernel knowledge is beating me..
