I disagree - the standard says there's a sequence point at a function
call after evaluating all function arguments. To me this means that any
(parts of an) expression the function call is contained in must be
evaluated after the function call. Otherwise it would be illegal to e.g.
modify a variable in both operands of && or ||.
I consider my opinion supported by the fact that the problem doesn't
happen with any non-Os optimization, where it is obvious that it would
in all cases be beneficial to load the variable's value into a register early.
(And, btw., after the change the code generated is significantly smaller -
hinting at questionable effects of -Os.)
