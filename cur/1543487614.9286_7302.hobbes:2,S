O.K. didn't have to wait a week so it means it's totlaly random in my
opinion, and it's not only 2.2.1 glitch, but 2.2.2 has the same thing.
Since I'm cc'ing this time to the l-k and l-smp then here's what's
happening:
Machine dies at random with:
Kernel panic: can't push onto full stack
There's nothing else on the screen nor there's anything in the system
logs.
The message comes out of the net/unix/garbage.c:
/*
 *      Garbage Collector Support Functions
 */
extern inline void push_stack(unix_socket *x)
{
        if (in_stack == max_stack)
                panic("can't push onto full stack");
        stack[in_stack++] = x;
}
If any other informations are needed please contact me directly.
Thanks!

-- Tomek,
"A sufficiently primitive malloc(3) is indistinguishable from memory leak."
