Subject: OOM killer problem - how to read the kernel log?

We have a database server which we've had some problems with, we've
had some serious crashes (particularly during postgres vacuuming)
which couldn't be fixed without hardware reboot.  We assumed that the
problem would go away by itself after upgrading the server to a new
box with 32G of RAM ... but, alas, one of the first days in operation
it first killed lots of postgres children during the evening, and
finally it crashed and required hardware reboot.  The box is certainly
not out of memory, but after reading some posts here, I've understood
that memory management is a complex issue.
We're running 32 bits linux, maybe it would help to upgrade to 64 bits?
I'm pretty sure that everything we need to know is located in
/var/log/kernel.log - if we could only interpret it, that is.  I'm
particularly curious about those lines:

I've copied out relevant files on
http://oppetid.no/~tobixen/oom_problem/
 - it's the complete kernel
log, /proc/config.gz, /proc/slabinfo, /proc/meminfo and dmesg.  Those
are of course fetched after the reboot.
atop shows a relatively stable situation with plenty of free RAM and
caches all the evening.
