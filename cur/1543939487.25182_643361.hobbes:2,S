I'm going to run some tests without limiting the memory to 80 megabytes
(so that it is 2 gigabyte) and see how much it varies then, but iff I
recall correctly it did not vary much. I'll reply to this e-mail with
the results.
I can do some bisecting next week and see if I find any, but it will
probably take a lot of time considering that I need to do enough runs..
how much should this vary anyways? The kernel is compiled as an UP
kernel and there is nothing running in parallel with it.. it is
basically a .sh script running on boot appending the output of time to a
file .. formatting and rebooting.
