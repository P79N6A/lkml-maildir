Finding the RAM amount depends on BIOS, some are very broken and just don't
work, period.
If you are talking RAM on the video card, that very much depends on the
card. For many of them the information that tells you how to find that out
just isn't available (together with the more complex stuff to really get
the card to work).

Those are parameters that depend on your _monitor_, not your video
card. And try to set up Win98 with an unknown monitor (i.e., a not PnP
one)...
