I think it is not a problem for OpenVZ because there is not that much of
sharing going between containers as you mentioned (btw, this least
amount of sharing is a very good thing).  Though I'm not sure if one has
to go to the extent of doing fractions with memory accounting.  If the
containers are set up in such a way that there is some sharing across
containers then it is okay to be unfair and charge one of those
containers for the specific resource completely.
