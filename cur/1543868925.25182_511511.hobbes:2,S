This is the minimum, that the standard asks for.
Note, your porposal would touch the times in vfs_getattr(), which
means, that the modification times would depend on the time of the
last stat() call, which is not really right, though it would still be
conforming.
It is much saner, if the modification time is always the time of the
last write() or msync().
