No. Actually I am just wondering, will it be possible to check whether a 
particular task has memory allocated or mmaped from this node to avoid killing 
an innocent task. I compared with memcg, to say that memcg never kills a task 
not related to the memcg constrained oom. Sorry if I was unclear, earlier. If 
we do this, oom-controller will not require special handling for cpuset 
constrained ooms.
