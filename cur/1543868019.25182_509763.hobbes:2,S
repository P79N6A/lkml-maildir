Hmm, as this is a new feature with regard to the mainline kernel, old
utilities don't count (if you can install a new kernel you can also
be expected to install new user-space tools for the new feature).

I don't know, ask whoever is responsible for the file.

If it's of general use put it in the appropriate header file. If it's
just for the pps subsystem name it as such.

Hmm, think about x86_64 with 64-bit kernel and 32-bit userspace, probably
having got different padding in the struct. Read LDD3, chapter 11,
especially 11.4 .
