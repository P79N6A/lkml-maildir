} OK, that code doesn't *depend* on the list_head being the first member

Chapter 4: Functions
[snip...]
However, if you have a complex function, and you suspect that a
less-than-gifted first-year high-school student might not even understand
what the function is all about, you should adhere to the maximum limits
all the more closely.  Use helper functions with descriptive names (you
can ask the compiler to in-line them if you think it's
performance-critical, and it will probably do a better job of it that you
would have done).
