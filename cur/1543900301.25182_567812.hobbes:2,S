That's not necessary.

It's an absolute time stamp, but users of this interface are more 
interested in the time difference between events and how they change over 
time. E.g. NTP time stamps are 64bit fixed point values with a 32bit 
integral part.
This is not an interface to read the current system time, so 32bit will 
continue to work.
