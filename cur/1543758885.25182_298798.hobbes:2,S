Well it would have been great if this was mentioned in the actual
discussion at the time.

Any mmap changes requires the mmapsem.

Lets undo that then.

They can implement their own approach with the provided hooks. You could
for example use SSE / MMX for atomic 64 bit ops on i386 with PAE mode by
using the start/stop macros to deal with the floatingh point issues.

Because if a pte is locked it should not be used.
Look this is an endless discussion with new things brought up at every
corner and I have reworked the patches numerous times. Could you tell me
some step by step way that we can finally deal with this? Specify a
sequence of patches and I will submit them to you step by step.
