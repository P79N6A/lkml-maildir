    Nonsense.   If I want the computer to automatically install routes
    when I ifconfig an interface up, I'll do it in ifconfig -- it might
    be useful to have an option to big brother the kernel for people who
    want to tweak their networking, have written their own replacement
    for ifconfig, but who don't know enough about networking to add the
    proper routes.
