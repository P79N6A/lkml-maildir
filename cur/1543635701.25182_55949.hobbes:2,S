I think you want to do this in user-mode so you get to use
the FPU on Intel Machines. Actual interface to any hardware,
i.e., the stuff that sends/receives sounds can be done in
a cooperating kernel module.
We do this kind of stuff here at Analogic. We make all kinds
of waveforms using mathematics, then we write the stuff to
hardware memory and end up with really complex waveforms with
periods in the GHz range, while we created them at a leisurely
MHz or less (build waveform, then upload changes).
You really don't want to use 'C' runtime library routines inside
the kernel because some expect to interface to the kernel using
the user-mode API (int 0x80). This is NotGood(tm)!
Cheers,
