Subject: [PATCH] Fix AVR32 for instrumentation menu removal
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Mathieu, I want to get oprofile support queued up for 2.6.25, and
since I don't see any signs that the Kconfig.instrumentation removal
patches are going in any time soon, I'm going to turn things around
and apply these two patches to my tree.
This unfortunately means that your patch won't apply cleanly to -mm
anymore, but it'll hopefully be easy to fix. When you do, please add
ARCH_SUPPORTS_OPROFILE to arch/avr32/Kconfig as well.
Me:
This patch fixes the changes made by [PATCH 2/2] [AVR32] Oprofile support so the
instrumentation removal patch applies correctly.
Should be applied after "[PATCH 2/2] [AVR32] Oprofile support", but before the
instrumentation menu removal patches.
