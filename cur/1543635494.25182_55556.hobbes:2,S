As long as the new, bash-ignorant code is as good as the old one, and
works equally well with bash and hopefully better with other shells,
I see no harm, and a lot of benefit, in accepting the patch.
Yes, a lot of code assumes bash is there, but unlike the case of gcc,
there are good alternatives. Let us enable people who use
ksh/tcsh/rc/whatever as their main shell to remove the bash they keep
installed simply to be able to build their kernels.
For those who wonders: I use bash, nothing else. Still I think it is
silly to argue against this kind of patches because a lot of other
parts of the build-system/config-systems till depends on bash.
Getting rid of the bash:isms everywhere is far from impossible; look at
Debian, they are mostly there.
