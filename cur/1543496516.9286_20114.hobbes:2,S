So what you're saying is that it would be useful for the kernel
routine that produces the syslog messages to insert an extra message
if it gets asked to produce two separate messages less than (say)
250 nanoseconds apart? It certainly shouldn't produce such a message
if it gets asked to produce a multi-line message though.

Not as they currently stand, no, but if they're done correctly, then
races should show up easier...
Best wishes from Riley.
