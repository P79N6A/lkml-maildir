if I am reading 'B' vs. 'b' correctly:
sysrq key codes are currently all lower case only.
Of course, that could be changed to support upper case.
That would require sysrq help messages in a different format
(currently the keycode for the action is Capitalized, e.g.,
b => reBoot).  And I suspect that it would allow some users to
enter b vs. B or B vs. b etc. unintentionally.
In any case, the sysrq_key_table could easily fill up soon,
so we may be force to support UpperCase codes.
