In the UML case, I want the system to automatically be able to hand back any 
sufficiently large chunks of memory it currently isn't using.
What does this have to do with specifying hard limits of anything?  What's to 
specify?  Workloads vary.  Deal with it.

Ok, so you want to artificially turn this into a zone balancing issue in hopes 
of giving that area of the code more testing when, if zones weren't involved, 
there would be no need for balancing at all?
How does that make sense?

I was under the impression that zone balancing is, conceptually speaking, a 
difficult problem.

Great, you're advocating migrating the fragmentation patches to an area of 
code that has known problems you yourself describe as "particularly silly".  
A ringing endorsement, that.
The fact that the migrated version wouldn't even address fragmentation 
avoidance at all (the topic of this thread!) is apparently a side issue.

If I'm not mistaken, you introduced zones into this thread, you are the 
primary (possibly only) proponent of them.  Yes, zones are a way of 
categorizing memory.  They're not a way of defragmenting it.
