I think for something like this to be really useful, you should not just
say "can be replaced with Xxxx", but have some docs (or pointers to such)
for both users and developers (depending on who is affected) on _how_ to 
replace it, or fix it.
Also, I'm not convinced about the single-file format. If we want to do
this (I don't know how much it buys, but hey, I certainly also don't have
any objections), I think it would be much nicer to have a separate 
"deprecated" subdirectory, with one file per issue. 
(Not that I think it necessarily needs to be just about deprecated or 
removed features - again, if we do this, I don't see why it shouldn't 
contain the same information about semantic changes, so that when the 
locking for an interface changes, you could have a
	Documentation/changes/vfs-ioctl-locking.txt
that tells what the new rules are).
Would most of the files be small? Sure hope so. But so what?
