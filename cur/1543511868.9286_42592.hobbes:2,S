Subject: Why not export find_task_by_pid?

... or rather, pidhash, as that is the unexported symbol which is used
within the inline function find_task_by_pid().  Seems it would be useful
for modules.  Else must I take a long walk starting from init_task?
Also, wake_up_process would be a nice one for kernel modules to use, too.
