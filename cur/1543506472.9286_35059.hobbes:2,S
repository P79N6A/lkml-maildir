well, the logic in filemap_nopage expects it to be locked.  readpage()
won't unlock a page -- it's unlocked when I/O is completed -- unless
readpage() completes the I/O synchronously.  if an error occurs while a
request is being scheduled, then the page is left locked, since no I/O
exit will be called to unlock it.  that's pretty much what an error return
from readpage() should mean, since it automatically triggers a re-drive in
filemap_nopage.

i think all that code deserves review.

i'm not sure that this Page_Uptodate check is needed...
