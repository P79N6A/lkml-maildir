People gets init killed with 2.2.x (not at all with my VM patches). And
infact if you don't do the above you can easily kill init due OOM.

My VM patches has nothing to do with the above patch. But incidentally the
above patch will work _only_ with my vm patches because 2.2.x won't call
oom() if the system goes OOM but it will silenty send a sigbus that may be
trapped from a malicious user btw. (so in 2.2.x you should do the check
for current->pid even in do_page_fault...)

To make init not in danger you only have to add such simple check
infact. That's what you have to do also in any kind of heuristic.
My guess about the init problem is that if you play with `login` or if an
init-child gets killed while the machine is OOM you may cause init to
alloc memory.
Now I think that killing the faulting task is a too much high risk.
Killing the tasks that belongs to the higher mm in the system (exluding
init) is at least a bit better and may avoid damages in a "normal" system.
Rik could you send me your latest version of the OOM-killer patch? I would
like to have a look at it (I still have an old version and I don't know if
you released any newer version). I may integrate your sure better
heuristic in the oom() call (I could replace my silly OOM-killer that I
written yesterday from scratch), do you think it would be a good idea? My
oom() now looks like this (so you don't need to download VM6 only to look
at this bit of code):
void oom(struct task_struct * task)
{
        struct task_struct * tsk;
        struct mm_struct * mm = NULL;
        unsigned long max = 0;
        read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
        for_each_task(tsk)
        {
                if (tsk->pid == 1)
                        continue;
                if (tsk->mm->total_vm > max)
                {
                        mm = tsk->mm;
                        max = mm->total_vm;
                }
        }
        if (mm)
        {
                for_each_task(tsk)
                {
                        if (tsk->mm == mm)
                        {
                                printk("\nOut of memory for %s.\n", tsk->comm);
                                force_sig(SIGKILL, tsk);
                        }
                }
        }
        read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
}
It's sure enough here but I know that there may be cases were we may kill
the wrong proggy. Anyway I think it's better the above _simple_ heuristic
than to kill the "random" faulting task.
