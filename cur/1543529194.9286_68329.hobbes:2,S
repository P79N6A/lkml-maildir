The above is one of the messages found in kernel.log. They seem to be
issued when I run X with glx module (utah-glx) loaded. What do they imply
?
The kernel is 2.3.50. The same with 2.3.47 (maybe others also).
Under 2.2.14, when I run X, I randomly get an oops, related to
'misc_open'.
The system is a dual celeron + G400 and xfree86 3.3.6.
