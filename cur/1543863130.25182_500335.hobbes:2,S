I am still getting better I feel:
[sukhoi@Typhoon ~]$ time dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/1GB bs=1M count=1024; time sync
1024+0 records in

Linux used here is not 2.6.20-rc5, but it's a FC6 2.6.19 binary. Shall
post the results with 2.6.20-rc5.
BTW, does the results vary with a customized kernel (configured w.r.t
Processor & Hardware) than a generic kernel like FC6?
Are there any other such test cases?
