Subject: drivers/sound/esssolo1.c does not compile under 2.3.45-pre2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As a result of applying 
	pre-patch-2.3.46-2 
patch, it breaks compilation of drivers/sound/esssolo1.c
The patch includes the following lines (for drivers/sound/esssolo1.c file)
-static int solo1_probe(struct pci_dev *pcidev, const struct pci_device_id *pciid)
+static int __devinit solo1_probe(struct pci_dev *pcidev, const struct pci_device_id *pciid)
 {
        struct solo1_state *s;
-       struct pm_dev *pmdev;
it removes declaration of pointer to struct pm_dev, but later in the function
pmdev appears.  I got it compiled by restoring the declaration line, but 
just wondering whether the removal was intentional ...
Please let me know.
Thanks
Andrew Park
