As usual, without documentation you only know what the code
does, not what it's supposed to do or why it does it.
Documentation is an essential ingredient when hunting for
bugs in the code, because without the docs you have to guess
whether something is a bug or not, while with docs it's much
easier to identify inconsistencies.
