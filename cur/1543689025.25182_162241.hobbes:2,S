I don't see how.

No.  The two concepts are really unrelated.

Tainted modules are not "broken" -- they just display a "tainted"
message.  We do not do things to deliberately break binary-only modules.
The driver model has four main benefits, in my eyes:
	- unifies code between the previous desperate driver models
	- creates a device topology, which is needed for power 
	  management
	- allows for things like sysfs and other logical device
	  representations
	- it is just the Right Way to do it
None of your questions are related to the driver model, really.  It is
not a new uniform driver API, if that is what you are thinking.  It is 
a topology/hierarchal abstraction for devices.
