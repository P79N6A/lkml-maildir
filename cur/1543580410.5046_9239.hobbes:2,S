Subject: kernel 2.4.1 : unresolved external name_to_kdev_t in md.c

unpacked kernel 2.4.1, configured a very modular kernel, including
modules for RAID linear/RAID-[015] and now I get an unresolved external
in the module md.o, as reported by depmod:
 depmod -ea
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.4.1/kernel/drivers/md/md.o
depmod:         name_to_kdev_t
The symbol 'name_to_kdev_t' is unknown. Same or similar kernel .config
file in 2.4.0 gave no problems at all. After looking in md.c I saw that
the 2.4.0 version contained a lot of #IFDEF's which are not all gone -
perhaps the assumption is now made that the md.o module is compiled into
the kernel by default now?
FYI: name_to_kdev_t is listed in init/main.c.
any clues anyone?
Tx,
JJK
