Uhh, I think you got this test reversed.  Didn't you mean != 1?   
Otherwise you only do the dec_and_test when the refcount is one,  
which means that you leak everything kref-ed.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
