If your task is better priority the scheduler will make it preempt the 
worse priority task. It sounds to me like you are complaining that the 
worse priority task is still getting cpu? If so, you misunderstand 
priority - it orders tasks according to priority giving lower latency 
and preemptive behaviour to the better task, and gives _more_ cpu but 
not all the cpu. The cpu must still be shared, but with more cpu 
distributed to the better priority task. If you want your better 
priority task to get _all_ the cpu you have to use real time scheduling.

P.S. Please dont top post when replying, it's hard to follow an email 
thread to see what you're replying to if you do that. These threads can 
get very long and confusing.
