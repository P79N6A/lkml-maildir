Subject: [RFC][PATCH 2/2]  Twofish cipher x86_64-asm optimized
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/7/21

Implementation:
-----------------------
This code is based on the current linux twofish cipher c implementation. Only 
the decrypt/encrypt routines were replaced by optimized assembler code. The 
in-kernel code by Matthew Skala takes care of the keysetup and precomputation 
of the sbox lookup tables.
I have eliminated stack use, tried to optimize the code as much as possible 
and limit code size. The patch is similar to the existing aes assembler 
implementation.
Testing:
-----------
The code passed the kernel test module and passed automated tests on a 
dm-crypt volume reading/writing large files with alternating modules ( c / 
assembler ) and comparing results. It is also running on my workstation for 
over a week now.
Benchmarks:
-------------------
Performance on a dm-crypt volume increased about 47% while reading. With 
256bit keylength its pretty close to the speed of the aes assembler version.

The write performance in this benchmark was limited by the harddrive and not 
the algorithm / system speed. Any suggestions how to benchmark the overall 
speed accurately are welcome.
Patch:

Please have a look, try, improve and criticise.
