When trying to compile SimGear-0.0.12 under 2.2.16, with gcc-2.95.2,
I could (quite reproducibly) cause an unbounded number of:
  VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for x
where x was cc1plus, kswapd, syslogd, etc.
Under 2.2.17pre20, this still start to happen, but shortly thereafter
the kernel kills cc1plus, and it stops.  I don't think I'm reaching
memory exhaustion; I've got 256M ram, and I ran the compile from the
console with nothing else running.
Is the cause of this behavior known, and if not, what can I do to help
diagnose it?
