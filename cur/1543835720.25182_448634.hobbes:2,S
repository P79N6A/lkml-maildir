This would be worthwhile, if only to be able to futz around in Solaris-made
filesystems.
Are you volunteering? You'd probably need a friend in Solaris-land who
passes you information on how things are done, and copies of filessytems to
take apart, and so on. 
First question is if there are any restrictions (patent or otherwise) on
doing this, just copying is out of the question due to (unfortunate)
licence on Sun's part.
