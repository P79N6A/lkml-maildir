The patch in my prevous message (Mon, 24 Jan 2005 00:32:16 +0100) still
makes sense, if only for cleanliness: Without it, the i_extra_isize
field of reserved inodes is zeroed even though we're not allowing
in-inode attributes there. It's probably better to leave the garbage in
these inodes untouched; we could in theory disable in-inode attributes
for arbitrary inodes with this change.
Cheers,
