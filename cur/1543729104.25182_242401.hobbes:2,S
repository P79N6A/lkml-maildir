No, neither of them.  It checks the DMA buffer position, so the
accuracy of the latency measurement depends on the size of DMA buffer 
fragment (called "period" in ALSA).
The only thing related with the time in the pcm layer is the call of
do_gettimeofday() when status ioctl is called (or at each DMA
interrupt, depending on the running mode).
