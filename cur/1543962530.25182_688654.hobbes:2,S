Doh!  When sending patches that happens automatically.  I should teach
git the same trick.

Definitely.

Yes.  I would like to keep the merge version roughly in sync with the
external patch, at least for a while.  Not sure how to deal with one
needing the multi-version hackery and the other not wanting it.

On most files, yes.

Sure.  I don't have any logfs-specific ones yet, but even that fact
should be made explicit.

inode_lock will get fixed.  The BUG_ON could get removed.  Not sure
about add_to_page_cache_lru yet.

Making a merge dash whilst moving is not always the wisest choice. ;)

2.6.27 appears to make more sense, yes.

Excellent!  Thanks a bunch!

I believe it is currently subscribers-only with the usual bounces
everyone holds so dear.  I should change that and add a spam filter to
make it bearable.
