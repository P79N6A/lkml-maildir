      hello folks, i`m here to report significant success in VM area
   achieved by latest Rik van Riel` patch vs 2.4.12-ac3.
    The system resposiveness on 24M ram in X improved quite considerable, 
   even though i started an additional xmms over gimp with opened image +
   opera + some xterms. This leaves me with 37MB swap and system no more
   goes mad when i point`n`click random windows...
    Btw xmms havent clicked...
   Overall: quite great job!
cheers, Samium Grommoff
