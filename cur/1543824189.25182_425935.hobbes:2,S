Will do.

Depends on the application I guess. If CONFIG_INPUT is disabled, then
only applications that read /proc/acpi/event will see the ASIM events.

Sorry. Corrected.

I hope I understood you correctly, the } on .ops after .remove should
align with the . ops right?. I tried to conform with button.c and
others. I will make the change I think you are suggesting anyway since
it seems more natural.
 74 static struct acpi_driver acpi_button_driver = {
 75         .name = ACPI_BUTTON_DRIVER_NAME,
 76         .class = ACPI_BUTTON_CLASS,
 77         .ids = "ACPI_FPB,ACPI_FSB,PNP0C0D,PNP0C0C,PNP0C0E",
 78         .ops = {
 79                 .add = acpi_button_add,
 80                 .remove = acpi_button_remove,
 81                 },
 82 };
 71 static struct acpi_driver acpi_video_bus = {
 72         .name = ACPI_VIDEO_DRIVER_NAME,
 73         .class = ACPI_VIDEO_CLASS,
 74         .ops = {
 75                 .add = acpi_video_bus_add,
 76                 .remove = acpi_video_bus_remove,
 77                 .match = acpi_video_bus_match,
 78                 },
 79 };

You are right. It's a bad idea, none of the other drivers do it. I'll
take it out.
