All things considered this isn't a bad idea. 
28 address bits, 2 bits "don't care"/8/16/32, two bits "future expansion". 
Correctly implemented phy-writers would then do:
	switch (addr >> 28) {
	case 0: if (val < 0x100)   write_phy_8  (addr & 0x0fffffff, val);
           else if (val < 0x10000) write_phy_16 (addr & 0x0fffffff, val);
           else                    write_phy_32 (addr & 0x0fffffff, val);
	   break;
	case 1: write_phy_8  (addr & 0x0fffffff, val);break;
	case 2: write_phy_16 (addr & 0x0fffffff, val);break;
	case 3: write_phy_32 (addr & 0x0fffffff, val);break;
	default: return -EIO; /* Don't know about fancy stuff */
	}
(My SAR has 32 bits for the value, and 32 bits for the address (from a
software point-of-view), but only 8-18 bits in the hardware. I wouldn't
know how to write an 8-bit value, so I'd just
	write_phy (addr & 0x0fffffff, val);
)
but current "expect only 8 bits" practise would work just fine for all
the other drivers. We'd just change the prototype a bit.
Mitch, Linus, can you live with this?
Roger.
