First results look good.
Using 2.2.5-ac4 with the patches you distributed everything
compiled clean.
FINALLY, I can write from a linux machine via nfs to a Solaris server
at right around 2 megabytes per second (100MB Lan).  This is acceptable
since before vers 3 support writing was around 500k/s at best.
However, reading has dropped to around 500k/s.  Can't we win?
I mounted the filesystem with options nfsvers=3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192.
Don't know how safe it is, but I tried wsize of 32768 and was writing
files between 3 megabytes and 8 megabytes per second!  Changing the
rsize to this didn't make too much difference.  Changing the rsize to
1024 did slow it down by a factor of 4.  Is it possible the rsize is
stuck at 4096 or something?
