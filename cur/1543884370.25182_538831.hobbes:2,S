Unfortunately, this community is not founded on the concept of
'wiki'.  It is founded on the concept of 'email'.  That is were most
discussions happen.
So if you want to start a discussion (and your topic certainly seems
relevant) I suspect you will get more participation if you keep it in
the mailing list.
So post a list of features that are apparently due for removal and ask
"can I actually get rid of these" (or whatever you want to ask).  and
then base on the response, do something else, maybe a revised list,
maybe a patch, maybe send it again in CAPITALS because nobody notice
when it was in lower-case :-)
Wiki's certainly have there place, but I don't think this is it.
