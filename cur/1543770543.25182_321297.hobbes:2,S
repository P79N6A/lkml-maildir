Have you attempted more generic fix-hardware-hang solutions?  I've known 
more than a few times where a good old "noapic nolapic" snapped a box 
out of some strange and seemingly unrelated problems...
Also, is your BIOS fully up to date/modern?  A quick Google search found 
a few things like this:

The problem might be more generic than a bad interaction between drive 
and kernel.
