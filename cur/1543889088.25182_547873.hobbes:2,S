OK,
What fails: A dir on the folder containing the offending file results in 
part listings or no listing at all.
There are no messages logged anywhere, dir completes successfully 
without complaining.  I'm going to recompile with the latest kernel and 
debug in a few weeks time (add the debug option to the NCPFS kernel module).
On this occasion the offending files had a character produced by MS Word 
in them.  I can't find out which charcode at present (think it was 
charcode 180).
