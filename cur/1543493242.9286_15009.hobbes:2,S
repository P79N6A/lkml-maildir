I don't know how to really explain this odd problem.  All I can say is
that when I execute/use most programs/daemons (perl, sshd, etc) it takes
numerous seconds before the process starts processing.  Once the
program starts responding, the program performs as I would expect.  This
started happening after the machine hung on the way down (init 6) and I
had to reset it.
Examples:
- - It takes 10 seconds to connect to the machine remotely via ssh.  Used to
	be closer to 2 or 3.
- - A simple Perl script "stalls" for about 3 seconds before doing anything.
- - Connecting to Apache takes about 3-5 seconds, but then it serves a
	simple static page (no graphics) virtually instantaneously.
A few other programs such as 'top' and 'pine' don't seem to have a
noticeable problem.  I'm in a real jam here, this system is supposed to go
into production as a web server, and the performance sucks so bad for even
the simplest page (it's even worse for CGI's) that I'm having to hold off
until this is fixed.
One other (perhaps unrelated issue) is that since the reboot, that running
via /etc/profile:  ulimit -c 1000000  causes the following error:
bash: ulimit: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted     
Any help/advice is extremely welcome.
