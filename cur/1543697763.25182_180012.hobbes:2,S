And not to dis my Alma Mater but I tend think the whole TOE idea is a lose.
I used to think otherwise, while I was a Sun employee, and Sun employee #1
pointed out to me that CPUs and memory were getting faster more quickly than
the TOE type answers could come to market.  He was right then and he seems
to still be right.
Maybe throwing processors at the problem will make him (and me now) wrong
but I have to think I could do better things with a CPU than offload some
TCP packets.
Linux has it right.  Make the normal case fast and lightweight and ignore
the other cases.  There are no other cases if the normal path is fast.
Another way to say "fast path" is "our normal path sucks".
