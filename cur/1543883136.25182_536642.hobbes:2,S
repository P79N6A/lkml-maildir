That was a problem because the previous update of sysfs_drop_dentry()
depended on walking from the root of /sys to the associated dentry to
drop it - which is quite nice because all dentry management can be
isolated.  I tried fixing it by 1. deferring drop of dentry till all its
children are gone (last child kills the deferred parent) 2. recursively
dropping all children when the parent is deleted (later drop of the
child becomes noop) but they both can't work with shadow directories, so
I gave up on the approach and just made synchronization around
sd->s_dentry correct.  So, it's not an issue anymore.  Verified to work.
Thanks.
