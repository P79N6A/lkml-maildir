I know, I'm late to the party here. :)
Anyway, i386 doesn't have vDSO gettimeofday because its always been too
messy to do. Now that the clocksource bits are in, we can start to
really work on it.
I just uploaded my C4 release of the timekeeping code here:
http://sr71.net/~jstultz/tod/broken-out/
If you grab the following patches:
  linux-2.6.18-rc3_timeofday-vsyscall-support_C4.patch 
  linux-2.6.18-rc3_timeofday-i386-vsyscall_C4.patch
They should apply to the current -git tree and then you can use the
following test to see an LD_PRELOAD demo (as real support needs glibc
changes).
http://sr71.net/~jstultz/tod/vsyscall-gtod_test_C4.tar.bz2
Only lightly tested, so beware, and I've only added support so far for
the TSC (so don't be surprised if you don't see a performance
improvement if you using a different clocksource).
thanks
