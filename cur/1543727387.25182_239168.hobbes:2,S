Just for the record, Ulrich. This is not correct--there is a fast path,
and you only need to use the kernel if 
a) there is contention
b) your architecture doesn't have the atomic cmpxchg for doing the fast-path
even in b), if you want fast-path, you can use the ufuqueue calls like
you would use futexes to do a fast-path, loosing the robustness and
advanced real-time thingies [you still get the scheduling-policy based
unlock/wakeup].
If one of those (b) arches wants the robustness and stuff, it then
_needs_ to go always through the kernel [slow]. 
Of course you don't want to penalize normal users, so it is easy to 
have a simple switch in user-space that will do it one way or the 
other depending on the attributes of the mutex they select [we haven't 
coded a proof-of-concept for  this yet, but we want to do it during fall].

Small point here--this only happens when there are waiters in the kernel
already. If there is no contention, the locker fast-locks in user space
only using his PID [this is weak, read the paper for some solutions to
avoid PID reusage collision]. If it dies, next time somebody tries to
lock sees the user space word (vfulock) locked and goes to the kernel.
The kernel looks it up, and if the PID doesn't exist, declares the mutex
dead and assigns 'current' ownership to it, back to user space.

So even in the robustness case there is fast-path. It is not significantly
slower.

This is not what I am hearing from embedded and enterprise guys. I just
wish they were more vocal and not expressed themselves only in private
mails--I understand you need a proof though.
