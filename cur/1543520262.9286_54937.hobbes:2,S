	Hello, 
	It seems to be a problem with this line (or at least that is what
the kernel report). Whenver I access the SCSI ZIP without a disk inserted
the kernel reports a bug at spinlock.h line 92 and it usually crashes 
just after reporting it.
	I first noticed that at 2.3.34-pre1 and it is still there in 2.3.34.
I'm using a SMP kernel.
	More info available upon request.

PS: The inclusion of the new i2c code has introduced some unresolved 
symbols in bttv.c (i2c_bit_del_bus and i2c_bit_add_bus).
