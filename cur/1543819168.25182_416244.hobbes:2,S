It looks like you are using old kernel, which had ability to multicast
messages not only to specified group but to any other which has at least
one bit from original group set, since 23 & 0x5 is true, message will be
delivered.
But in more recent kernel this is not the case anymore.
I will test your module tomorrow and report if it works correctly or
not. I've just tested w1 connector with completely different group
number which does have the same bits set (group 3 in kernel and group 4
in bind time in userspace), and message was delivered successfully.
I will investigate it further tomorrow.

No, cn_netlink_send() only returns zero if there are listeners and
message was successfully delivered.

You do not need any socket when you use connector.

This will deliver message to group 3 but not that one specified in
cn_msg header. You need to set second parameter to zero if you want to
automatically select the right group.

No need to release never initialized socket, although it is set to zero
and sock_release() is never called.
