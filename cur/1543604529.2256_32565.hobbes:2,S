I can't say what the current status is.   But some time ago some people I know
got burnt with silent corruption from using HPT cards with RAID5 and RAID0, the
cards were replaced with Promise cards, and the problem went away (as it should
- I've been running a lot of RAID on Promise cards and never saw the problem).
As long as there are Promise cards to get, I'm not going anywhere near HPT.
Maybe there's a fix somewhere, maybe there's a magic BIOS setting or upgrade,
maybe something else can make it work, I don't know.  Promise cards are cheap
so I don't care.
Sorry for not being able to give you "good" information, but at least now you
got "some" information.   Hope it helps, for what it's worth.
Cheers,
