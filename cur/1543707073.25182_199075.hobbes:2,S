Yes those results are in line with what I found on Reiserfs4 as well. I 
also tried incresing the number of streams to see when things start to 
break. Reiserfs4 seems to do well here as well. I stopped some tests 
early because some filesystems were just too slow.
Streams:   1     1      2      2      4     4      8     8      16    
16     32    32

It would appear that with XFS and Reiser4 I would be able to 
simultaneously record >32 MPEG TV channels on to a single disk. I think 
that exceeds my TV recording requirements by some considerable margin :-)
