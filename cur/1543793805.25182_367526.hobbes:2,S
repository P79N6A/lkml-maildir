Can you explain in a little bit more detail why this matters, and
exactly how it fixes your problem.  I'm not sure it's correct.
"init_currently_empty_zone" could more properly be called something like
"init currently empty zone to now have memory".  There's no reason to
call it, unless you have an empty zone *AND* you some memory to put in
it now.  If you call it with a size of 0, the things like memmap_init
inside of it don't make any sense.
Also, if you're doing hot-adds of _new_ zones at runtime, you need to do
something fancy with the zonelist locking that I never got around to
because nobody needs it yet.  See something along these lines:
