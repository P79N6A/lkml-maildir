Hi Linus,
I've been browsing the kernel mailing list and I have seen someone posting
here some progress in firewire development..
Would you include it please in kernel 2.3.x? firewire devices are the next
"hot" issues in devices (used in cameras, removable hard disks etc), and
your Sony Vaio also got a firewire port, so you can also use it :)
What do you think?
Thanks
