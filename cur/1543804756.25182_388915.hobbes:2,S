This thread has run on for a bit longer it seems, and it prompts me to 
back up to the original post and ask if the raw driver you are removing 
is the raw driver used when cups tells a device (a printer) to do this 
file using the -o raw format?
If this is the case, then a rather large amount of printing 
functionality will be removed as a side effect.  I hope I'm 
miss-understanding the intent here.
