You're right.

That does seem odd.  I'll fix it up.

Yes.  I'd done that conversion elsewhere, but overlooked it here.

It probably got copied from somewhere.  I'll clean it up.

I agree it would be nice to not have to do this in the driver.  The
specific requirement here is to make it send a packet after resume
(which includes arriving after a migration) so that a switch can quickly
work that the machine is there.  Is there a generic mechanism for doing
this?
