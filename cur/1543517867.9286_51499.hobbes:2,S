Ok.  Posting on Linux Kernel seems to be the only way to reach him with email.

Yes, it does feel like quite a relief.

Just what is on the website.  If you come to the Chaos Communications conference in
Berlin this month, you can hear me talk about the future of ReiserFS as a tool for
increasing the chaotic level of the OS by increasing the number of possible
interactions between OS components, and thereby raising its expressive power.....:-)
It's gotta be a fun conference, I'm gonna have fun giving this talk, so glad they
asked me to speak, it will be my first time there.....

Get Linux (
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS
 (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
