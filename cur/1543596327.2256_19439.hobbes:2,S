Well, ok. Your split the inode "files" too.
Hmmm...
That sound more complex than my version (at least now, until I've seen the
implementation - maybe it's easier because it has less special cases than
mine).
And of course the memory usage on the harddisk is much less with your
version as you split your inode data and don't have it duplicated.
Well, I hope to see an implementation soon - I'd like to help, even if it's
only testing.
Thanks for the answer!
Regards,
Phil
