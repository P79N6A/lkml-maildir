I have no idea why you assume that "having the right to do X" implies
"must be told how to do X". The have the right (except as laws
prohibit it) to modify the car's systems, but (except for some
specific legal requirements) the manufacturer is not required to
explain anything, even basic operation.

Yes, I agree. However, they are completely allowed to make it
arbitrarily hard for you to remove (by, for instance, welding the
safety in place).

Again, (IANAL), I think this is simply a misconception. Buyng a
physical object gives you the right to do anything with it that the
law allows, but imposes no obligation on the seller to explain it
(other than specific restrictions hte law may apply to specific
classes of objects for safety or other reasons). It's up to you, in
deciding whether to buy it, to decide whether it comes with sufficient
documentation to satisfy your needs.
