Wakeup does not happen until _enough_ (1/3 of snbuf) of space in sndbuf
is released, otherwise you will overschedule. So, as soon as
write() goes to sleep, it will sleep waiting until 1/3 is released.
If it is interrupted, it use all the released space immediately before exit.
Again, to make more for in this context. This can be even wrong and, probably,
we should return instantly with -EAGAIN/-EINTR/partial count, but it is most
likely suboptimal (though I have already changed this to instant return).
But this does not look essential from caller's viewpoint, except for
sendfile() of course. 8)
