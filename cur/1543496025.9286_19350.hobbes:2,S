I haven't actually tried this, but even if you can, it's worth
bearing in mind that the media has a *much* shorter life-span
than a normal hard disk. From memory, most support something
like 500,000 rewrites. On a normally mounted filesystem, that's
not going to last very long before you start looking at data
corruption. CD-RWs are really much better suited to occasional
write usage, like rotated media for daily backups than for
everyday use with a general filesystem like ext2.
