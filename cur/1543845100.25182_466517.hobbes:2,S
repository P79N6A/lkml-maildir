Yes, memory dependencies are changed, you are right. I was principally talking
about the inline and unrolled loops optimisations.

If you want to generate probes automatically, yes.

If you want to dump a raw binary blob, what about :
MARK(mysubsys_myevent, "char %p %u", blobptr, blobsize);
where %p is a pointer to an array of char and %u the length ?
My idea is to use the string to identify what is referred by a pointer, so it
can be casted into this type with some kind of coherency between the marker and
the probe.

I think that duplicating the number of marker macros could easily make
them unflexible and ugly. This is why I am trying to come with this generic
macro.

Good point, I will setup a va_args in the probe. When correctly used, however,
there is no need to use the format string : we can directly get the variables
from the var arg list if we know in advance what the string will be.
