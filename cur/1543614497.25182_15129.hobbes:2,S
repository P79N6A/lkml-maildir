How far in advance do you call "significantly"? I know of dedicated
systems still running Linux 1.2.12, and I use 2.0 series kernels on
some of my systems, so your solution is a non-starter in my book.
I'd say that there are only three options for safely dealing with
this problem...
 1. Allocate a fixed range for dynamic syscalls that can NEVER be
    used by static ones. If the static syscalls hit the bottom of
    it, they skip it and restart just above its top.
    Two variants of this have been proposed so far...
 	a.	Negative syscall numbers are dynamic.
 	b.	Syscall numbers with the MSB set are dynamic.
    ...and these are essentially variants on the same thing.
 2. Each syscall includes a flag stating whether it's a static
    or dynamic one, with separate jump tables for each. This
    would be something that is currently always the same state
    for existing static syscalls.
    One variant of this would be to redefine the syscall number
    as being two fields, with the MSB as the static/dynamic flag
    and the rest as the syscall number. This would incorporate
    option (1b) as a variant of this option.
 3. Have separate syscall entry points for static and dynamic
    syscalls.
...and anything else is at risk from the scenario referred to.

Very true, but not necessarily relevant.

Preventing this would require that solution (1) has been implemented,
in which case the new syscalls would be 256 and 257 as 240 through 255
are reserved for the dynamic syscalls.
