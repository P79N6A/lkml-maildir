Maybe I am missunderstanding something, but how is this
any different than simply doing:
	pci_dma_sync_single(dev, dma_handle, size, DMA_TO_DEVICE);
My understanding of the API is that I can map a buffer
as DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL and then specify the direction. An
existing working example is in the eepro100 driver 
in speedo_init_rx_ring():
   sp->rx_ring_dma[i] = pci_map_single(sp->pdev, rxf, 
              PKT_BUF_SZ + sizeof(struct RxFD), PCI_DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
later in the same function:
   pci_dma_sync_single(sp->pdev, sp->rx_ring_dma[i],
              sizeof(struct RxFD), PCI_DMA_TODEVICE);
If this is not allowed, then the docs and this driver
(along with any others using it) need to be updated.
If this acceptable, why add an existing function to
achieve the same goal?
