Ok, one not so silly Q (IMO) from the resident old fart.  I saw, sometime 
in the past week, a relatively huge ieee1394 update go by.  And I have 
some issues with the present 2.6.19 version causeing segfaults and kino 
go-aways when trying to capture from my firewire movie camera.  Problems 
occur when trying to control the camera from kino.
Is this patchset in this -rc1?  If it is, I'll see if I can get a build to 
work and check it out.
Thanks.
