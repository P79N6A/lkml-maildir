Hi Catalin,
I have tested your latest kernel memory leak detector on my ARM device
and for curiosity I have checked some part of your patch to figure out
how the memory is scanned and compared to radix tree for detecting
orphan pointer.
Let's suppose the a kmalloc() was executed without storing the
returned pointer to the memory area and its fictitious returned value
would be the address 0xb7d73000 as:
kmalloc(32, GFP_KERNEL);  // Cause memory leak
Is there any possibility the __scan_block() scans a memory block that
contains the memory area allocated by the previous kmalloc?
If this is possible, during the  "for (ptr = start; ptr < end; ptr++)
{} " loop in the __scan_block(), the ptr variable can assume the
address 0xb7d73000 and the radix_tree_lookup() returns the
corresponding  memleak_pointer and thus such pointer to this memory
area is not considered orphan (indeed it is an orphan pointer), right?
BR,
Mauricio Lin.
