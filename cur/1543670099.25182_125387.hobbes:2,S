The point of asm-generic is not to use the files, but to give porters a
hint about the functionality. Quoting asm-generic/bitops.h:
/* For the benefit of those who are trying to port Linux to another
 * architecture, here are some C-language equivalents.  You should
 * recode these in the native assembly language, if at all possible.
 * To guarantee atomicity, these routines call cli() and sti() to
 * disable interrupts while they operate.  (You have to provide inline
 * routines to cli() and sti().) */
Or is this comment wrong, too?
