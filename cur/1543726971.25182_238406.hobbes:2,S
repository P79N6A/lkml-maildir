  Where would the case of firmware download fit?  For x86 ATA/ATAPI
  devices, the vendor usually supplies a dos disk to accomplish this.
  However, that method is absolutely broken a PPC system.  We have to
  use a proprietary driver that was written using vendor specific
  commands.  I assume that all vendors have their own set of
  proprietary commands, specific to the device to be updated.
  Usually one does not need to do firmware updates, but when
  necessary, it is generally a requirement to do it on the system with
  the device, not to remove the device and carry it to a system where
  it can be done.
  If there was an interface to allow wide open operations, including a
  non-interrupt (polling) mode of operation, this would cover a large
  portion of devices.

  Allowed commands are really on a device specfic basis.  And a RAS
  requirement, for at least those of use that have funny endianess
  hardware.  :)
