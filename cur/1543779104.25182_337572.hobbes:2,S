Okay I'm really trying here but my PC really hates me :-)
I've set up an i865 machine with a serial console, and on-board graphics
(also have radeon/MGA AGP..) and in an effort to try and figure out some
more about suspend /resume to RAM..
However now the  serial port doesn't come back after resume, I just get
garbage sent out on it ...
Anyone any ideas?
Dave.
