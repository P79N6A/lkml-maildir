I have an ALI 1543, and enabled support fot it. It's working fine except
for the cdrom.
The cdrom is an HP 7100. It's an IDE. It works if I use programs like
cdda2wav, but doesn't when I want to mount a cd.
When not using scsi emulation:
ATAPI device hdd:
  Unknown Error Type: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
  (reserved error code) -- (asc=0x00, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "<NULL>" packet command was:
  "f0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
When using scsi emulation, it was saying something about trying to send
too much data.
When I remove support for the 15x3, everything works fine.
PS: I'm not on the list, so please CC me.
