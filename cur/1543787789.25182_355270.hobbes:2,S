Yes, this patch set removes "NUMA depends on SMP". It also adds some
simple NUMA emulation code too, but I am sure you are aware of that!
=)
I agree that it is very unlikely to find a single-processor NUMA
system in the real world. So yes, "[PATCH 02/07] i386: numa on
non-smp" adds _some_ extra complexity. But because SMP is set when
supporting more than one cpu, and NUMA is set when supporting more
than one memory node, I see no reason why they should be dependent on
each other. Except that they depend on each other today and breaking
them loose will increase complexity a bit.

Maybe. CPUSETS has two bitmaps, one for cpus and one for mems. So
depending on SMP or NUMA seems logical to me. Regarding the #ifdef, it
was added because partition_sched_domain() is only implemented for
SMP. That symbol has no prototype or implementation when CONFIG_SMP is
not set. Maybe it is better to add an empty inline function in
linux/sched.h for !SMP?

Absolutely. And that removes the need for some of my patches. QEMU
runs SMP kernels. It is possible to run SMP kernels on UP hardware.
But there is of course a certain performance loss introduced by all
the SMP locks. I'd rather not force !SMP users to run SMP kernels if
they want coarse-grained memory resource control.
Thanks for your input!
