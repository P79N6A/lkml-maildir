Stay away from onstream is my advice nowadays. 
We've been trying to get the stupid thing to work since july 8th, and
onstream technical support has been very helpful by telling us what to
do and such. Like downgrading to a kernel version that has known
remote attacks. However doing that does not solve the problems we
report. After much ado, they promise to "escalate" the problem to 
people in the states, and then this does not lead to results in 
the month we've given them. 
In short: in the simplest case, just writing a stream of bytes to the
drive, it works. But the drive then doesn't nearly have the "raw error
rate" that they claim.
If you start using a backup program that needs to seek back and forth
a few times, the drive loses track where it is, and doesn't recover
from this situation.
I've returned mine to my vendor, and I hope that Onstream gets the
message in the end: They do NOT support Linux.
