I was thinking of X, not audio.  This might be a problem for AV
playback.  Maybe that would depend on if DRI was in use.  Anyway I use a
low latency kernel because i need sub-ms response, I was just pointing
out that the current behavior might not be compatible with the 1ms
target.
However with the patch in -mm that enables setting max_sectors_kb, the
1ms goal can be achived by lowering this to 256 or so.  If I were
shipping a desktop distro I would lower this by default.  My tests show
the slowdown is barely measurable if at all.
