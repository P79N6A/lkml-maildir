This is quite interesting, as there is only one function/macro, which
seems to be messing up things -- I don't know much (hardly anything)
aboout that hardwarestuff, but I'll have a look at i8042_command as
soon as I find the time.  At least it's a start...

It works, so this seems to be the exactly same issue.  I only tested
with the code before the point above, I'll do further testings at the
weekend, but I'm quite optimistic, that you found the point of
failure.  Thanks!
