down_write(&mm->mmap_sem);
if (down_write_trylock(&another_mm->mmap_sem)) {
      ...
      up_write(...);
}
up_write(&mm->mmap_sem);
will never deadlock as if I have another thread is doing
down_write(&another_mm->mmap_sem);
if (down_write_trylock(&mm->mmap_sem)) {
      ...
      up_write(...);
}
up_write(&another_mm->mmap_sem);
booth will fail to trylock and go on.
