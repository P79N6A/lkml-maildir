Hi Again,
I've done some further tests disabling hyperthreading which then lets me
disable apic on the motherboard and when I disable these I can boot a
kernel compiled with smp, however it boots detecting only 1 cpu rather
than the 2 on the motherboard. If I then reenable APIC in the bios with
hyperthreading still disabled it fails in the same way, so the problem
seems to be with APIC. Any ideas what more I can try?
Thanks in advance!!
