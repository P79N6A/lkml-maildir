NVidia is aware, and they're doing the best they can under the circumstances
(no, they can't opensource it all, there's other people's intellectual property
in there that they licensed...)

Patching it so it won't taint is a one-line patch.  However, it's so
morally bankrupt that I'm not giving any more hints.
Much trickier is doing it so the same module will insmod into multiple
kernels without screwing the pooch.  If you look around in nv-linux.h and
nv.c, there's a number of checks of KERNEL_VERSION, and they're all there
for a reason.
