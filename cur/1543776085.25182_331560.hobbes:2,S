Subject: move KERNEL_VERSION define, changing CONFIG_LOCALVERSION rebuilds too many files

changing the CONFIG_LOCALVERSION string will trigger a rebuild of way
too many files, for no good reason. Looking over 2.6.13-rc2, almost no
#include <linux/version.h> is valid.
a few drivers need the KERNEL_VERSION macro to define their own version.
Unfortunately, this macro is in linux/version.h.
Where should I move/copy this simple macro? uts.h, utsname.h, kernel.h?
example users:
include/media/saa7146.h
drivers/media/video/bttvp.h
drivers/media/video/cx88/cx88.h
drivers/media/video/saa7134/saa7134.h
drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.c
