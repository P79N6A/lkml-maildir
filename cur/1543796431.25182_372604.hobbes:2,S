So was I. And now what? ipfwadm and ipchains should have been removed
from 2.6.0 if 2.6.0 was not to support these. That opportunity was
missed, the removal wasn't made up for in 2.6.1, so the stuff has to
stick until 2.8.0.

This doesn't matter. A kernel that calls itself stable CAN NOT remove
features unless they had been critically broken from the beginning. And
this level of breakage is a moot point, so removal is not justified.

Who cares what you or I use? It's a commonly acknowledged policy that
"stable" releases do not remove features that are good enough for some.
Linux 2.6 is not "stable" in this regard.
