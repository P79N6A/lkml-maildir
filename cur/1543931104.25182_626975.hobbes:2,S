Wrong: the bus is not a clocked bus. Read a book. There is
a "clock" trace provided, but it has nothing to do with the
bus or its timing. The bus is not impedance-controlled, nor
is it clocked. It relies upon certain established states.
Look in the back of the IBM/PC book or read about the bus
in 
http://www.techfest.com/hardware/nis/isa.htm
 and observe
the bus-timing with no clock involved at all.

Yep. We are all wrong. You come out of nowhere and claim to
be right. Goodbye.
