I have the merged result for io_apic and I believe it should also be
very clean in respect that it maintains the logic of of both patchsets
accurately. (About 6 hours to work through the complete file.)
What I'm confused about is how I'm to send this re-basing?  Do you only
want the patches in:
	.../pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rusty/linux-2.6-for-ingo.git
And I've no clue how to cause a git tree to rebase.  What I can do is extract
them into quilt patches, reapply and fix conflicts, and then send them
(as quilt patches).  I'll do that today, and if you need a git tree to pull from,
then we'll figure out how to do that (with Rusty's help as again, I do not
have an external source to provide one.)
Also, you mention in separate mail:
    Please tidy up the commit logs of new cpumask bits and dont leave bits in 
    it like:
     e861b55: cpumask: Add CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK
     65bda29: cpumask:clock_event_device-takes-cpumask-ptr
     07d73a8: cpumask:irq-functions-take-cpumask_t-ptr
     01fdd7d: cpumask:convert-few-difficult-cpumask_t-users
     9cc67bb: cpumask:centralize-common-maps
These patches went in via linux-next/rr, and are not part of the x86 patchset that
I'm working on.  I can only offer to help resolve the conflicts though again, I'm
not sure how I send them to you?  Would it be the commit from a "merge conflict
resolution" sent as a git-bundle?  [I've not done this yet so I'm really guessing.]
The tree for these changes are in:
	.../pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rusty/linux-2.6-cpumask.git
and they include many, many non-x86 arch files, so sending them to you is not what
should be done, yes?
Rusty - can you fix these subject lines in your git tree?
Thanks!
Mike
