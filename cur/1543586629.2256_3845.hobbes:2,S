Hi,
I tried to install redhat 7.0 on a compaq presario 5685 with onboard
networkcard. According to the linux-kernel this card needs drivers for the
Digital DS21143 card.
But when loaded, this card wouldn't work. So i tried a diverent version of
the kernel by trying to install redhat rawhide. The driver complains it
cannot found the MII transever.
Because I need this networkcard to install to install the distribution
from the internet. I would really like to know how to get this working.
I hope anyone had this problem before and can provide me with a solution.
If more information is required, just let me know.
Best Regards,
Olaf Woudenberg.
