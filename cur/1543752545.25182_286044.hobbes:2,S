Subject: 2.6.10 dies when X tries to initialize PCI radeon 9200 SE

2.6.10 boots fine, but is killed by the X server when it
tries to initialize my PCI radeon 9200 SE.  This problem exists
in 2.6.9 too, but not in 2.6.8.1.  So I'm stuck with that version currently.
The problem seems to be access to the card bios, X uses
int10 bios calls to initialize the card.
