Which means that one of the cpus is spinning for 5 seconds with
interrupts disabled.  CPU watchdogs are *good*.

The timer is directed both as a normal interrupt 0 and as a broadcast
non maskable interrupt.  The NMI count on each cpu should be roughly
the sum of the interrupt 0 count across all cpus.
The NMI path is fairly fast so the overhead is small.  When it does
trip you have a problem, a cpu is spinning for far too long.  Extract
the NMI report from the log, run it through ksymoops and mail the
decoded result.
