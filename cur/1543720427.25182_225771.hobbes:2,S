  Hi again
  Thanks for the hint on device_suspend (realy !! gives me a starting point
  for debugging.

   This becomes a little bit scary. Someone else on this list already
  mentioned that there is a strong movement towards everything which
  is at least a desktop/server machine. And on the other hand there are
  these embedded systems which seem to be attractive for linux to.
  ACPI seems to be nifty for such things like hardware monitoring and
  stuff. That makes it interesting for servers etc...
  Everything in the middle (aka laptops) seems to slowly drop out of the
  loop. PCMCIA seems to be another ugly example. Anyway ...  I'm not frightened
  by this manpower. Just want to have my laptop running 2.6.x and suspending
  to RAM. I'll do my very best and report back if there are any significant
  findings.....
