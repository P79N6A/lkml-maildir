 - what are the kernel versions shipped with those distros ?
 - perhaps your bios setup has ECC ram enabled or some other bad settings ?

I suppose it's 40 GB instead.

it's used when you want to recompile your kernel. Copy it as
/usr/src/linux/.config, start "make oldconfig" to see if options have changed
between it and the kernel you try to compile, then "make menuconfig" and
disable unwanted options (perhaps machine check exception). Then
"make clean && make dep && make bzImage modules", and try to boot on the new
bzImage (arch/i386/boot/bzImage).

it seems as your kernel hangs very early, too early to even load a module.

try passing "noisapnp" in this case. But you don't need ISA slots to have
onboard ISA chips anyway.

I also have a yahoo account without this problem because I've disabled
HTML mails.

System.map is used by insmod, ksymoops and other tools which need to know
the address of certain kernel symbols. That's unrelated to your problem.
Your problem comes from the kernel image itself. At this stage, it cannot
read any file. BTW, have you tried with the kernel used by the install to boot ?

Your motherboard isn't unique ; these days, it's very hard to find a
motherboard providing at least one ISA slot.
 
hoping this helps,
