Patchset update:
http://kernel.kolivas.org
These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness with 
specific emphasis on the desktop, but suitable/configurable to any 
workload. Read details and FAQ on my web page or feel free to email my 
mailing list with queries.
This version is a recommended performance and bugfix update for those 
already running ck5. It does not include any of the newer latency hacks 
etc in 2.6.8-rc* as this version (2.6.7-ck6) is to retain the stability 
already present in -ck5.
