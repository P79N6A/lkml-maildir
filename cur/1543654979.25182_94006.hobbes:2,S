	At this time, it sounds like the existing spam countermeasures
on the lkml mailing list work well enough that your bincancels were
doing more harm than good.  That could change in future.  At that
point, I suspect that the bincanelling would be done at the mailing
list.  So, I'd say leave bincanceling of linux.kernel off and that'll
be the end of this issue (at least until someone specifically requests
otherwise).
