So, what is it? I figure it does profiling, but that
sure is vague. The SourceForge site is pretty empty too.
From freshmeat.net and an ANNOUNCE-2.5.0-pre1 file, I'm
guessing you made some user-readable x86 registers be
per-process instead of system-wide, but maybe you've
done much more or less.
Does it use the oprofile interface? (why or why not?)
Does it use the IA-64 perfmon system call?
Does it support the Pentium-MMX in an old PC?
Does it support the PowerPC MPC7400 ("G4") in a Mac?
(if not, what would porting involve?)
Does it handle the kernel itself?
Does it handle stripped dynamic libraries?
Does it handle unmodified executables? (regular, -s, -g)
Does it work without root privileges?
Does it unmangle names for C++ code?
