Huh?  I can't see where a sign extension happens.  0x85C0B90 has the bit
#27 set to one, not #31 ...
Beside that the values are passed around as unsigned values everythere.
Can you please explain in more detail what is going on?

Works fine here:
tuner: tv freq set to 140.25
mt2032_set_if_freq rfin=140250000 if1=1090000000 if2=38900000 from=32900000 to=39900000

Wrong, VIDIOCSFREQ is "_IOW('v',15, unsigned long)".  Beside that I'm
very surprised that this actually makes a difference.  What architecture
is that?  And what size int/long have there?

That is ok.
