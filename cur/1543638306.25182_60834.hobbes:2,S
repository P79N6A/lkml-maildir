> - The change to MAX_ORDER is unneeded
It's not only unneeded, it's detrimental. Not only will we spend more
time merging stuff up and down to no effect, it also makes the 
config_nonlinear stuff harder (or we have to #ifdef it, which just causes
more unnecessary differentiation). Please don't do that little bit ....
