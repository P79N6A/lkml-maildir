Alan is right, however "unlikely" you think it is. 
Turning off stuff in the config register not only turns off the standard
BAR's, it can turn off _everything_.  Including stuff that isn't even
covered by the standard BARs that are beng probed. 
It's like shutting off the power for the whole house because you want to
change a lightbulb.  Sure, it's safer for the lightbulb, but if you
don't know what -else- needs power in the house, it sure as hell isn't
a good idea. Maybe you just trashed your wifes work because she happened
to be in front of the computer when you turned off the lights.
