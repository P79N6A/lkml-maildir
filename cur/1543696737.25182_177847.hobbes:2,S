The idea atleast, is that if no one is using a dentry, it will
be put in the dentry lru list and eventually returned to the slab.
inodes too are returned alongwith. Just like how on-disk filesystems work.
Typically, an open() of a sysfs file would result in creation of the
corresponding dentry/inode and holding of the reference. close() releases
the reference. The last one to release puts the dentry in the lru list
for later pruning. The result is that we have less memory use and
smaller number of dcache hash table elements under normal circumstances.
