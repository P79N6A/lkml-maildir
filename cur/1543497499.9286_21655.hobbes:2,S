I have longstanding pending race fixes for proc/array.c. If you want you
can merge them into your next patch.
If you want you can grab:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel/2.3.4_andrea1.bz2
and look only at the array.c part of the patch. Really in array.c I also
moved get_wchan in arch/*/kernel/process.c and there's a new entry in the
stat files for the reporting lock-profiling info (I merged this last thing
from a patch from Andi).
