I looked through acpi/mpparse/setup and I don't think there is
a problem. acpi does mp_config_acpi_legacy_irqs if it found its
tables, but this is done before get_smp_config, and get_smp_config
bails out early if ACPI already has done the deed. If it were a
problem, it would affect _all_ MP configs not just yours.
I'll submit the patch to Marcelo then, with appropriate explaination.
(No forward port to 2.6 is needed, since the arrays-to-pointers
change hasn't been done there (yet).)
