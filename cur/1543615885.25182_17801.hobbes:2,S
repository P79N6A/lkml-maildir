yes, in such case again we've to giveup with the writes so we've to
cleanup the leftovers first.

correct, it shouldn't be necessary. I wouldn't add it. if a fs breaks the
buffer_new semantics it's the one that should be fixed methinks.

I found another problem,  we really need to keep track of which bh are
been created by us during the failing prepare_write (buffer_new right
now, not a long time ago), or we risk to corrupt data with a write
passing over many bh, where the first bh of the page contained vaild
data since a long time ago.  To do this: 1) we either keep track of it
on the kernel stack with some local variable or 2) we change
the buffer_new semantics so that they indicate an "instant buffer_new"
to clear just after checking it
