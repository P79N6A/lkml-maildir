Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Stacked GIT 0.12.1 release is available from 
http://www.procode.org/stgit/.
StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These
operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored
as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into
other repositories using standard GIT functionality.
The main features in this release:
    * Allow StGIT to run when there is no user information configured
    * Use 'git-pull' rather than 'git-fetch' by default
    * Fix the 'mail' command to parse multiple-lines address headers
    * Fix the alias check in the 'stg mail --bcc' command
    * Add '--merged' option to rebase
    * Add '--url' option to 'import' to import a file directly from the network
    * Add '--author' option to 'series'
