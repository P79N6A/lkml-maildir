The generic serial driver (8250) is the one that was
dead locking when that code originally existed.
It was setting low_latency and calling from interrupt context.

No, the delay work must be used for flush_to_ldisc()
so it makes no sense to define two different work queues
(one delayed and one not) for the same work.
I support your patch.
The current stuff works and your patch works.
With your patch, you actually reduce initial
latency for processing receive data.
Whichever way everyone else wants to go.
