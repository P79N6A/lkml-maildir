Many thanks,
the patch worked well in the meaning of possible module insertion. But I
wasn't able to configure the card with ACU well.
With older firmware it's possible to insert module and to configure it
with ACU, but I'm not able to configure the card well. The whole
password menu produces segmentation fault :-))
Is there any other way how to configure this card? Unfortunately it
doesn't support wireless extensions.
