Ah...

Nope, the patch I referred to is one I am developing for the Linux
kernel itself, and specifically the files...
	arch/i386/boot/{bootsect.S,setup.s,tools/build.c}
...which will allow the built in bootloader (when compiled in bzImage
mode) to boot kernels of 1M and more in size (the current limit for
the in-built boot loader is 1,048,560 bytes - 16 bytes short of 1M).
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
