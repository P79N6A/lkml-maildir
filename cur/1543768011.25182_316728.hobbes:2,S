Hi,
I'm trying to write a lcd driver for a HD44780 compatible display.
Basicaly it will be the only screen available on my linux board.
My problem is that I don't know which desgin I should use when
implementing the lcd's driver, because several choices are possible:
1) implementing a dumb char device  "/dev/lcd"
2) implementing a console driver
3) implementing a tty driver
I can't find any documentation on vt that makes the choice quite
hard but when looking at the code it may be the best choice for
user-space. Do you think it's the good direction ?
Thanks for your advices,
      Francis.
