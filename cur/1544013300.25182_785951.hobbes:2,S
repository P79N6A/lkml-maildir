The issue I noticed with the WD Passport drives is that the hard disk
won't spin down with /usr/bin/eject, which is used by HAL if the user
ejects the device (i.e.  via his desktop environment).  The WD Passport
drives need to be set into a sleep power condition. Something
like "sg_start --pc=3 /dev/sdX" needs to be used in this case.
I just checked hdparm -Y, and this works too.
