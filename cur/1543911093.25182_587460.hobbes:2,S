Well, it's not necessarily broken, it's just a different model.  At some 
point the cost of maintaining a whole suite of virtual drivers becomes 
greater than leveraging a bunch of legacy drivers.  If you can eliminate 
most of the performance cost of that by changing something at a layer 
below (port I/O), it is a win even if it is not a perfect solution.
But I think I've lost the argument anyways; it doesn't seem to be for 
the greater good of Linux, and there are alternatives we can take.  
Unfortunately for me, they require a lot more work.
