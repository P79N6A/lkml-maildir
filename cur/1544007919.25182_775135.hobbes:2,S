I posted a fix for that weeks ago. But the pktcdvd maintainer stated,
that the char device nodes are not used for anything. So the whole use
of dev_t should be removed entirely. They just blindly claim the same
char dev_t the block devices use, and conflict with char devices from
other subsystems. Patching out the /sys/dev/class links fixes the
oops, but the underlying fundamental breakage will still exist.
Original mail here states:
"Maybe, but that character device would not be used for anything,
besides creating sub-directories in /sys/class/pktcdvd. The driver
implements a block device, not a character device."

No idea why this never got fixed.
