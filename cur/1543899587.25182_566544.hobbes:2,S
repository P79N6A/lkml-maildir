    Same version here.

    OK, grand. So it's cdparanoia's fault.

    Yes, I did read the code, and I didn't find any reason for it to
exist, but I didn't understand the purpose of SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV.
Thanks for explaining this :))
> It is probably about time that cdparanoia was updated ...
    I think the same, but given that it works, Monty probably doesn't
have much motivation to update it. I don't know if the problem resides
in the cdparanoia program itself (so using the DAE problem from cdrkit
will fix the issue) or in the paranoia library. In this case, the
problem will affect any program using the library.
    Anyway, if you need any testing, just tell :)
    Thanks a lot!
