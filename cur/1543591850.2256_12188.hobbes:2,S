8 slots (and  you're right, 6 is a practical upper limit, fewer for 
66 MHz) *per bus*. Buses can proliferate like crazy, so the slot 
limit becomes largely irrelevant. A typical quad Ethernet card, for 
example (and this is true for many/most multiple-device cards), has a 
bridge, its own internal PCI bus, and four "slots" ("devices" in PCI 
terminology).
