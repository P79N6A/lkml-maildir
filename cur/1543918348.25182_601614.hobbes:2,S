I guess the "wrong message" is an artifact of pud/pmd folding;
but I get too confused by the different levels myself to want to
think more about it - I'll just assume it's "right" somehow ;)

I should have spent more time reading Nick's reply and less time trying
to work it out for myself!  Yes, that's the conclusion I came to, for
some reason you're now going beyond the user vmas and walking into the
linear kernel mapping, which has _PAGE_GLOBAL and _PAGE_PSE bits set.
