I would like to implement the management of performance counters
interrupts on a Pentium Pro. I encounter the following problem: 
 To manage the interrupt, I need to configure the APIC. The APIC seems
to
be used only in SMP mode, though. The problem is that I'm in
mono-processor mode. Is it possible to use the APIC without choosing the
SMP mode during the kernel configuration or is it possible to recover
the counters interrupts without using the APIC at all?
