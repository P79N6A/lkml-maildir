Actually, not really.
They get entered with the stack pointer aligned, at least in my tests.
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <signal.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	extern void handler(int);
	void *saved_esp;
	asm("handler: movl %esp,saved_esp; ret");
	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
	        signal(SIGALRM, handler);
	        alarm(1);
	        pause();
	        printf("%p\n", saved_esp);
	        return 0;
	}
always prints out an aligned address for me.
You seem to be expecting that the address be aligned "before the return 
address push", which is a totally different thing. Quite frankly, I don't 
know which one gcc prefers or whether there's an ABI specifying any 
preferences.
