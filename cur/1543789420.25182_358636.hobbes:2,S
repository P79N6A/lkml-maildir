this is one more area where there's no good substitute from 'walking the 
walk', i.e. getting yourself dirty with actual code. I have been 
involved with the following variants which were part of the -rt tree:
- we implemented both timeouts and timers with the same
  timeout-optimized framework [i.e. with the 'wheel'] - it sucked.
- timers and timeouts with a timer-optimized framework [i.e. with a
  binary tree] sucks too, due to the tree overhead.
- we in fact tried another variant too: a hybrid method where timers and
  timeouts lived in the timer wheel and some time before (hr) timers
  were about to time out they were put into a separate hr-list. This
  hybrid solution sucked too.
so then we tried a separate API and subsystem for both of them, and 
voila, many of the uglinesses went away, and things became robust.
