I have no problem with  using scsi cdrom emulation ,
using teac 58E RW and ide-scsi emulation.
Only problem I found is when writing TOC (within cdrecord)
I have to wait until it finished (I cannot even change console)
to be more strange, I have that problem only at work
PIII 500Mhz with TEAC 58E but on
PII 633Mhz with TEAC 54E and PPRO 200Mhz with TEAC 58E I haven't
that problem. Note that was for 2.4.14-17
With kernel 2.2.19 there is no such behaviur.

 Zoran
