That regression fix still doesn't seem to be merged, or
even in the MM tree.
Here's a tweaked version of what Haavard sent.

This patch corrects recently changed (and now invalid) Kconfig
descriptions for the DMA engine framework:
 - Non-Intel(R) hardware also has DMA engines;
 - DMA is used for more than memcpy and RAID offloading.
 
In fact, on most platforms memcpy and RAID aren't factors, and DMA
exists so that peripherals can transfer data to/from memory while
the CPU does other work.
