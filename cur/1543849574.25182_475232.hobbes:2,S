Yes. As far as I can tell:
- special ordering (when you find __define_initcall in the 
kernel source, you know)
and
- linking order
play a role.

/etc/modprobe.conf, but the proper answer would be "no".

I am sure you can use some modprobe magic, such as:
  install 8139too /usr/local/bin/my-8139-loader
And your 8139-loader contains:
  #!/bin/bash
  while ! condition; do
	sleep 1;
  done;
  modprobe 8139too;
I just don't know how well that fares when you are trying to modprobe 
from within modprobe.
