The constant case is probably most used (at least for page flags), and
is most important for me. constant_test_bit may not be using inline asm,
but the volatile pointer target means that it reloads the value and can't
do much optimisation over it.
BTW. once volatile goes away, i386 really should start using the C
versions of __set_bit and __clear_bit as well IMO. (at least for the
constant bitnr case), so gcc can potentially optimise better.
