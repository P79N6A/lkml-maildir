Sans notification, the plan proposed in the first paragraph and rwlock
with down_read_trylock() for addition/removal is pretty similar.

When a bus device is being woken up and rescanning the bus, all
prerequisites for the bus should have been resumed already.  As long as
the newly added device is placed after the bus device itself, things
should be safe.  Well, that's the theory at least.

How high performance device addition/removal should be?  Wouldn't rwlock
be enough?

Hmmm... locking all device mutexes sounds scary to me but I tend to be a
chicken and lockdep is great, so it might just work.  :-)

Why is that necessary?  What happens if there's some long-running
read/write operation using bin attr?

Right, it's nothing major.  I just dislike such limitation is visible
from individual drivers and "echo 1 > /sys/whatever/kill-yourself"
returns before the suicide is actually complete.
Thanks.
