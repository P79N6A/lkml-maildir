I don't know if the field attracts the insane, or if being
in the field drives one there, but I'm not going to deny that
we have our share of high grade loonies.

I'm pulling the whole arguement about when is pluggable good
and when is it bad, as everybody seems inclined to use it to
support thier own position.

Sure, and I can emulate a rubber doorstop with Michealangeo's David,
that doesn't make it a good idea. And I keep seeing "should", not
"is". Emphatic assertion is not evidence.

Making SELinux bigger would not make it suit the typical Smack use
better. Smack is simplified, that's a major point.

Personally, I care about what I produced can do, and the uses to
which it will be put. I am not convinced that SELinux can do many
of the things that Smack can, and I know that a system that can
only be used effectivly by Security Professionals is not for everyone.
Smack has a different focus than SELinux. I see no need for hostility.
If SELinux wants to incorporate Smack features, that's OK with me,
but it won't make SELinux simpler. Heaven knows I have leaned heavily
on the implementation example of SELinux.
