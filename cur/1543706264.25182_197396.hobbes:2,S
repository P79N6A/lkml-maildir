There were messages before that, yes.  Here come bits of my kern.log.

The entries until 12:11:21 are when I used dvconnect (which worked).
So there are indeed three lines before the actual oops, including two
that look like error messages.
  If there's anything else I can povide, just say so, I just can't
think of anything.
  Thanks,
Roland.
