I tried putting the controller and drives into my main work machine 
(running Gentoo Linux 1.2), and it also hangs, though it doesn't even 
display the version info.  This leads me to believe that if I debugged 
it on my machine, the results would be different than if I debugged it 
on the server.
Would there be any way for me to use this card as a normal SCSI card, 
using a SCSI driver, and just not use the RAID functionality?  This 
machine isn't going to be stressed very much, and software RAID should 
be adequate.
