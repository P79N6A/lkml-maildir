I will NOT allow anything that walks page tables. That's pretty much
completely out of the question. The rawio stuff gives access to the page
tables, and no device will be accepted that does more than that. Page
table walking has always been a complete disaster, and it's much simpler
to just set up the array of physical addresses separately (ie either at
mmap time or through the factilities that rawio does offer).
The intel DMA scatter-gather engine is very useful for doing various
scatter-gather things (and for 32<->64-bit translations), but you should
NOT see it as an excuse for walking the page tables. I will not accept
drivers that do that - it's a maintenance nightmare, and is just basically
a bad idea.
