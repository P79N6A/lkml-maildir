Subject: Booting uncompressed kernel image on i386?

Is there an easy way to boot uncompressed kernel (2.6) image instead of 
the compressed one (bzImage) - using e.g. LILO?
I'm trying to do that because the decompression takes about 15 seconds 
on my i386 (it's really an i386 - i386DX/25 :-) The uncompressed kernel 
is about 1.5MB. I've already tried compressing it using gzip -1 instead 
of gzip -9 but that didn't make decompression any faster.
