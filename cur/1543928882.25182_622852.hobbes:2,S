I think it's an issue of volanomark (a kind of java application) instead of JVM.

There is no, so I suggest to set sched_compat_yield=1 by default.
If sched_compat_yield=0, kernel almost does nothing but returns. When
sched_compat_yield=1, it is closer to the meaning of sched_yield man page.

I just found SCHED_OTHER in man sched_setscheduler. Is it SCHED_NORMAL in
the latest kernel?
