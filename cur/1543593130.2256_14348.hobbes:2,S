Hi once more...
I'm sorry for the layout of this mail. It is written in a web mail
system...
The attachements are in ASCII format even if the web-mail make it base-64
Now I have compiled a vanilla 2.2.19 kernel and have SMP working, without
Ultra-DMA. I used the functional kernel config from 2.2.19-ide and just
activated SMP.
From that I have 3 very simular kernel configurations:
2.2.19 with Hidrick's IDE-patch, no SMP: working
2.2.19 without IDE-patch, with SMP: working
2.2.19 with IDE-patch and SMP: not booting
With all the information I hope that someone can help me with the
IDE-and-SMP
problem.
