Subject: Rereading disk geometry without reboot

I am using linux kernel 2.6.9 on a san.  I have file systems on
non-partitioned disks.  I can resize the disk on the SAN, reboot and grow
the XFS file system those disks.  What I would like to avoid rebooting or
even unmounting the filesystem if possible.
Is there any way to get the kernel to re-read the disk geometry and change
the information it holds without rebooting or reloading the module (which is
as bad as a reboot in my case)?
Thanks,
Andy
