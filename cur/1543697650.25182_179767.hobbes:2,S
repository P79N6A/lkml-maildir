I wrote it always custom tailored to the problem (it is not very difficult, but
you often have to tune it a bit until it has the right frequency to find the
corruption) Don't have one here right now, sorry.  Chris had a aimed to be 
generic patch for 2.4 that may still be around. I don't think it would fit 
into current LTP because it is an kernel module (LTP doesn't have a kernel build 
infrastructure right now).  But it would be an useful addition longer term to it 
I agree, once they support kernel modules.
