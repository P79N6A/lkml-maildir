and it also provides high avaibility that is mandatory in a setup that
needs high performance anyways.

Exactly. I totally agree with you (everybody who talked with me about those
issues or attended my last two talks can confirm I agree ;).
But you're talking about real world. I was only talking about benchmarks.
Don't complain me if usual benchmark setup is done with one server N-way SMP +
N-Gbit-NICs (infact I can't run any usual webserving benchmark at home).
