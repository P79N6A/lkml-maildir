I can confirm that xine with alsa-mmap option set does cuase strange
behaviour, though I notice it mostly as audio and video getting out of
sync when playing videos.  I've noticed this behaviour since I started
doing weekly xine CVS builds.  I've never bothered reporting it however,
I just turned off the option... which leads me to my question, what is
the advantage of using alsa-mmap in an app if it is used correctly?
And Malte, are you using emu10k1 driver per chance?
