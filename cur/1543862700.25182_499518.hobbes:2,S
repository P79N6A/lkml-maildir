  it's not like i'm trying to be territorial or anything.  if someone
wants to handle all these changes, go wild.  it's just that this
discussion of ARRAY_SIZE started back in december:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/17/85
  i have a check for possibilities where this change can be done in my
"style" script:
  $ grep -Er "sizeof ?\(?([^\)]+)\)? ?/ ?sizeof ?\(?.*\1.*" .
  and i also have a script that crawls the tree, making the more
obvious changes.  (it will miss spots where the expression is broken
over two lines, stuff like that, so there will probably be a few
stragglers that will have to be done manually.)
  i haven't done anything with this lately as i was waiting for the
new release, whereupon i'm assuming the floodgates will be opened
and all the pending changes will finally start to wander upstream.
then all these changes might make sense as a multi-part patch.
  but, as i said, i'll leave this to people much smarter than me.
