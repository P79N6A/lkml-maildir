You need to send more than 510 jobs to see the problem.

Ok.

Attached are the file dump1.bad, and dmesg.bad.
The console only starts printing out the "nf_ct_tcp: invalid packed
ignored" messages after the 22 seconds "pause". Look for pause at
"23:40:27.454677", and resume at "23:40:59.469704". The first console
message at "23:40:59".

No such message. Even after trying many times. But there's still a 26
"pause" from "23:49:41.368812" to "23:50:07.392278". It's able to
resume and continue printing in "burst".
These tests were ran with just 520 jobs using:
for((i=1; i<520;i++)); do echo $i | lpr -Plp; done
Sorry for the delay. Traveling.
Thanks,
Jeff.
