What about the freedom to buy devices with certified code on it, while
still being able to look through the source code and verify for yourself
that it is correct and not full of bugs?  Would it be better if the
devices that have to be certified and locked down used secret code so
that the purchaser can't verify the code?
Apparently the only restrictions ever permitted are the ones the FSF
thinks of.

So really what the GPL v3 wants to have is to make sure that the user
can reproduce from the sources a bit for bit identical copy of the
binaries?  Too bad compilers that put time stamps and such into the
binary would make that imposible.  I don't think there is any way that
can be written into the GPL that can prevent all loop holes for how to
make signed binaries.

There doesn't have to be an agreement.  The software company could just
release specs for a hardware design and let others freely go and build
them from that design.

But if the hardware ships with only code that simply waits for the user
to provide some code for it to isntall (which has to be signed in a way
the hardware likes), then the hardware has nothing to do with the
license of the software.
The signed binaries from the service provider/software developer on the
other hand is GPL and the sources are released with changes.  They just
happen to sign their binaries in a way that allows them to install on
the hardware in question.  It could also install on hardware that
doesn't check the signature as long as it is functionally identical
otherwise.
I hope no one does this, but I still don't see how the GPLv3 draft deals
with this case, or even how it could deal with it.
