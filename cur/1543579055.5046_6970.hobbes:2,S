Hi again,
	It looks like some progress is being made, *wonderful*, as to some earlier
questions...

Yes. Absolutely no problems on non-bigmem.
> smb_rename suggests mv, but the process is ls ... er? What commands where

It seems that ANY access to the smbfs has this affect. Definitely confirmed
are: ls, tab completion from bash, cat [some file], and usually df.

I'll try to do this and report back.
