Subject: [patch 26/26] V4L: cx88-blackbird: fix vidioc_g_tuner never ending list of tuners
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Jelle Foks <jelle@foks.8m.com>
v4l-info and other programs would loop indefinitely while querying the
tuners for cx88-blackbird cards.
The cause was that vidioc_g_tuner didn't return an error value for
qctrl->id != 0, making the application think there is a never ending
list of tuners...
This patch adds the same index check as done in vidioc_g_tuner() in
cx88-video.
