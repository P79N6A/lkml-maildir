It might be convenient to have a completely unoptimized 386 kernel.  While 
this would obviously be non-optimal in all cases, it would be compatible 
with everything and probably faster on non-386 than a 386-optimized 
kernel.  Of course, the gains are probably not worth the time it would take 
to write one, as I would hope that most linux users are willing to compile 
their own kernels...
