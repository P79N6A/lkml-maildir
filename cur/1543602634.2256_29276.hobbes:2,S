I know next to nothing about these VM issues, but here's
another data point:
2.4.9-ac15 was painfully sluggish on my ThinkPad 600,
Pentium II, 120 MB RAM system just running galeon
or compiling a kernel.  The disk would begin thrashing
and continue doing so for many minutes.  Swap usage was
reported as zero the whole time.
I applied the "2.4.9-ac15-age+launder" patch and things
improved dramatically.
