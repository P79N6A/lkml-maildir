Hi,
this is the second version of the dmaengine and framebuffer for i.MX31 and 
its Image Processing Unit patch-series. Being based on linux-next of 08.12 
it now uses the updated dmaengine API, still, patch 1 adds the discussed 
tx_free link to the descriptor struct. Please, review and comment. I 
understand we have little time left for the next merge window, but as this 
is a new driver, and hence cannot cause regressions, I hope to get it in 
for 2.6.29.
Thanks
Guennadi
