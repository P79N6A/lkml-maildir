A simple more generic solution is to do this
struct things_to_keep my_bits
{
	..
};
struct things_to_keep __persistent card_info[NUM_CARDS]
{
}
and have insmod do
	load module up
	open /var/run/moduledata/$modname
	if exists && is from this boot then && is right size
		read data into __persistent ELF section
	endif
	load into kernel
	init module
and rmmod
	cleanup module
	open /var/run/moduledata/$modname
	write data from __persistent segment into file
