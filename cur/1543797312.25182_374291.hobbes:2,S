This turns out to be quite difficult, and I can't see a clean way of 
doing it without touching scsi or rewriting chunks of the ACPI glue 
code.
The basic flow of code required here is:
1) scsi layer registers a new device
2) platform_notify is called, which is (in this case) 
acpi_platform_notify
3) acpi_platform_notify checks whether it knows dev->bus. If so, it 
calls appropriate callbacks.
Without touching scsi, there doesn't seem to be any way for (3) to work 
if scsi is a module. Would a simple
#ifdef CONFIG_ACPI
acpi_scsi_init(&scsi_bus_type)
#endif
in the scsi code be acceptable? If not, then we have some difficulty. 
The acpi glue code has to be statically linked in, so it can't rely on 
anything that directly references the scsi code.
