All you have to do is drop the incoming packets if they exceed
a certain bandwidth. That will stop the corresponding ack automatically
since your TCP stack won't even see the packet.
I'm doing this on my ISDN line to limit the rest of the house to one
third of the bandwidth even if they're all busy downloading tons of
warez. I'm paying, I want the bandwidth when I need it. They can get
it all when there's no traffic for my machine.
No problem with the HTB queueing discipline.

Yes, latency is a problem if you want to saturate your bandwidth. It is
easy to guarantee some bandwith for latency critical stuff - just
don't give out that piece of bandwith to something else. Of course,
then most of the time that piece is wasted... and it doesn't help with
problems somewhere along the net.

Dunno about that one.
