2.5.69-mm8 is fine, 2.5.67-mm1 dies before mounting anything read-write.
The early kernel boot is fine, the penguin appear,
a bunch of the usual messages scroll by too fast to read,
and then it hangs.
The kernel is UP, with preempt & devfs.  All filesystems
are ext2. This kernel has no module support.
Root is on raid-1, there are two
ide disks connected to this controller on separate cables:
00:02.5 IDE interface: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5513 [IDE]
Here's the decoded crash, written down by hand:
