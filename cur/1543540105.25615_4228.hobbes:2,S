Subject: Excessive buffer cache hash size in 2.2

I recently noticed that on a 2.2.16 kernel on a 128MB machine:
Jul 27 05:05:38 fred kernel: Buffer cache hash table entries: 131072 (order 7, 512k) 
Could someone give a rationale for using 1/256 of a machine's memory for the buffer 
hash table ? 
Why does it need to be that big? (especially given the cache misses such a huge 
table causes)
