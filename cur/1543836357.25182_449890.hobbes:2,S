tg3.c:v3.49 (Feb 2, 2006)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:01.0[A] -> GSI 24 (level, low) -> IRQ 17
eth0: Tigon3 [partno(BCM95704s) rev 2100 PHY(serdes)] (PCIX:100MHz:64-bit) 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet 00:14:5e:86:44:24
eth0: RXcsums[1] LinkChgREG[0] MIirq[0] ASF[1] Split[0] WireSpeed[0] TSOcap[0]
eth0: dma_rwctrl[769f4000] dma_mask[64-bit]
02:01.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5704S Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)
        Subsystem: IBM: Unknown device 0301
        Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 17
        Memory at efff0000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
        Capabilities: [40] PCI-X non-bridge device.
        Capabilities: [48] Power Management version 2
        Capabilities: [50] Vital Product Data
        Capabilities: [58] Message Signalled Interrupts: 64bit+ Queue=0/3 Enable-
The other interesting bit of information is that after networking card
goes dead and I do the "ifdown eth0; ifup eth0", the following printk
shows up:
tg3: tg3_abort_hw timed out for eth0, TX_MODE_ENABLE will not clear MAC_TX_MODE=ffffffff
This is from an IBM LS-20 blade.
Is this helpful?
