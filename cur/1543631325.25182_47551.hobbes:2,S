When getting solid lockups like this, nmi_watchdog.txt can sometimes break
you out and give an Oops to work off of.

Multiple SCSI devices on the same bus often have termination problems which
can result in scsi bus lock-up or even data integrity problems. Make sure
you understand the finer points of SCSI device termination. You might want
to try running just one drive off the card and see if the system stabilizes.

Although it's probably not related to your lockup, I have problems with the
eepro100 drivers, most notably memory leaks. It is worth using the updated
e100 linux driver from the Intel website instead. Note that the driver name
is changed from eepro100 to e100.
