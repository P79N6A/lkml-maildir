I've seen it. It's an artefact of timekeeping that it takes an accumulation of 
data to get all the information. Not much I can do about it except to have 
timeslices so small that they thrash the crap out of cpu caches and 
completely destroy throughput.
The current value, 6ms at 1000HZ, is chosen because it's the largest value 
that can schedule a task in less than normal human perceptible range when two 
competing heavily cpu bound tasks are the same priority. At 250HZ it works 
out to 7.5ms and 10ms at 100HZ. Ironically in my experimenting I found the 
cpu cache improvements become much less significant above 7ms so I'm very 
happy with this compromise.
Thanks!
