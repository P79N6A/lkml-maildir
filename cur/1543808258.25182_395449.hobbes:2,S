I am only sending the relevant stuff.
My strace output :
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=48, ...}) = 0
fcntl64(3, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)         = 0
getdents64(3, /* 3 entries */, 4096)    = 80
getdents64(3, /* 0 entries */, 4096)    = 0
close(3)                                = 0
exit_group(0)
strace output on a partition under ext2
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0
fcntl64(3, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)         = 0
getdents64(3, /* 4 entries */, 4096)    = 104
getdents64(3, /* 0 entries */, 4096)    = 0
close(3)                                = 0
fstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 0), ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1,
0) = 0xb7ddc000
write(1, "kapil  out\n", 11)            = 11
munmap(0xb7ddc000, 4096)                = 0
exit_group(0)
We can see that my strace does not call the fstat, mmap, write and
munmap calls. It directly calls the exit_group call. This is what i
fail to understand. The getdents seems to be returning data correctly.
And filldir() called by  the readdir() seems to be working
correctly(am not sure).
So i fail to understand why the other calls are not performed.
I would like to remind you that i have not written all the calls. For
example i dont have my file systems implementation of the write call.
But atleast i shd be able to call the default.
any help would be appreciated. And can anybody think of an other way i
can test my filesystem with a smaller call. "ls" seems to be calling
way too many system calls. My filesystem is a disk based file system
with my superblock in a floppy.
