Hmm? It compiles just fine here even without any patches
with the defconfig. Ok there are some warnings, but these can be 
safely ignored.
(or at least 2.5.71 did, current -bk doesn't again
because someone changed settimeofday without fixing the ports
correctly) 
Of course you are usually better off when you apply the current
patchkit from 
ftp://ftp.x86-64.org/pub/linux/v2.5/

When you fix x86-64 bugs you should submit the patches.
