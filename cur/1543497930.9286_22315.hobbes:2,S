I am experiencing mouse and keyboard "deaths" when switching from X to
console and then back (Ctrl-Alt-F1, Alt-F7). Computer does not freeze, but
keyboard and mouse do not work (I cannot move mouse and press any keys).
Sometimes it happens just after 'startx'. PS/2 keyboard and Logitech wheel
mouse, Redhat6 intel, kernel 2.2.7. If I remember it started to happen
around
2.1.130 kernel - earlier it was ok.
from XF86Config:
Section "Pointer"
    Protocol    "MouseManPlusPS/2"
    Device      "/dev/mouse"
    ZAxisMapping 4 5
/dev/mouse -> /dev/psaux
