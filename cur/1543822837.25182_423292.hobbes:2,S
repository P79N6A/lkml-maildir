First upgrade to the latest FC5 kernel (2.6.16-1.2108), and try again.
If it still doesn't work, try the latest plain kernel (2.6.16.x or
2.6.17-rc) and try again. If it still doesn't work, Send it to the
linux-ide list.
Even if you don't try the latest plain kernel, upgrade to latest
FC5 kernel before sending the bugreport to linux-ide.
