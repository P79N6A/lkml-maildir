I get the following error when compiling 2.5.70 for sparc64, using
gcc-3.3:
 CC      init/version.o
scripts/fixdep init/.version.o.d init/version.o 'gcc -Wp,-MD,init/.version.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -m64 -pipe -mno-fpu -mcpu=ultrasparc -mcmodel=medlow -ffixed-g4 -fcall-used-g5 -fcall-used-g7 -Wno-sign-compare -Wa,--undeclared-regs -finline-limit=100000 -fomit-frame-pointer -nostdinc -iwithprefix include    -DKBUILD_BASENAME=version -DKBUILD_MODNAME=version -c -o init/.tmp_version.o init/version.c' > init/.version.o.tmp; rm -f init/.version.o.d; mv -f init/.version.o.tmp init/.version.o.cmd

fs/built-in.o(*ABS*+0xb766971): In function `__crc_register_ioctl32_conversion':util.c: multiple definition of `__crc_register_ioctl32_conversion'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
The problem is apparently register_ioctl32_conversion() is exported twice
for a few architectures:
./fs/compat.c:int register_ioctl32_conversion(unsigned int cmd, int (*handler)(unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long, struct file *))
./fs/compat.c:EXPORT_SYMBOL(register_ioctl32_conversion);
./arch/ppc64/kernel/ppc_ksyms.c:EXPORT_SYMBOL(register_ioctl32_conversion);
./arch/sparc64/kernel/sparc64_ksyms.c:EXPORT_SYMBOL(register_ioctl32_conversion);
Since compat.c is only built if CONFIG_COMPAT is defined, the entries in
${arch}_ksyms.c are incorrect (at the very least, they need to test for
this sort of thing).  I don't see the harm in removing the exports
altogether from the arch-specific stuff; so, that's what this patch does
(to both {,un}register_ioctl32_conversion).  Please apply (or correct me
;)
