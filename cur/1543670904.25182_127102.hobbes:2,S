The only possibiity is that the code you just showed is not
being executed. Absolute location 0x100 is not being overwritten
by some timer-tick (normally) so whatever you write there should
remain. You just put a byte of 1 in that location and then
you compared against a byte of 1. If the CPU was broken, you
wouldn't have even loaded your code.
It is quite likely that the IP is being diverted around your code
by some previous code.
FYI, you can check the progress of your code by 'printing' on
the screen. Set up ES to point to the screen segment, and write
letters there:
	movw	$0xb800, %ax
	movb	%ax, %es
	movb	$'A', %es:(0)
This 'prints' an 'A' at the first location on the screen.
