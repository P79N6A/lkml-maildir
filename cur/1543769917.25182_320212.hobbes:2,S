So here the trees are identical in between the two versions, so the later 
commit is definitely not doing anything. What's up?
I don't have a "git-undo" script, but it looks something like this:
	echo [top-you-want-to-save] > .git/HEAD
	git-read-tree -m HEAD
	git-update-cache -f -u -a
and you're done - it should take less than half a second.
You can do "git-prune-script" at some point if you want to throw away the
objects that are no longer reachable, but the way you work, you'll never 
even notice - you'll just have another stale head that isn't reachable 
from anywhere any more.
