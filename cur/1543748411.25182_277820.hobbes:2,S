Wouldn't root be the only user who could do that?  When would this
happen?  
If it's happening by accident, then something's wrong, and it's
helpful to make it known that something's wrong.  If it's on purpose,
then somebody has root and is doing malicious things, in which case
syslog flooding is the least of our worries.  They could do the same
thing using "logger" anyway.
