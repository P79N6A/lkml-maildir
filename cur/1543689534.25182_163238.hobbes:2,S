Heh.  You want stable plugin API.
It will always end as bloat:
(a) you add plugin API
(b) its not sufficient, so you add revision 1 of the API
    (you still have to support rev 0 because some plugins are binary-only)
(c) its not sufficient, so you add revision 2 of the API
    (now you have 3 versions of API to maintain)
...
Alternatively you can start with over-designed API from the beginning :-).
