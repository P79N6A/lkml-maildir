Subject: [BUG] usb/core/hub.c loops forever on resume from ram due to bluetooth
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have just replaced my primary single-core notebook
with a nearly identical dual-core notebook,
and moved the usb-bluetooth peripheral from the old
machine to the new one.
On the single-core machine, suspend/resume (RAM) worked
fine even with the bluetooth module enabled.
On the new dual-core machine, resuming with bluetooth
enabled results in an infinite(?) lockup in an unbounded
loop in hub_tt_kevent().  With PM debug on, I see
tens of thousands of these messages scrolling on the console:
     kernel: usb 5-1: clear tt 4 (9042) error -71
     kernel: usb 5-1: clear tt 4 (9042) error -71
     kernel: usb 5-1: clear tt 4 (9042) error -71
     (over and over and ...)
By restricting iterations on the unbounded loop
the machine is able to resume again.
Greg / Marcel: any words of wisdom?
And we should probably put bounds permanently on that loop:
I devised/used this patch to accomplish it.
Now, I still get close to a thousand or so such
messages, in groups, showing up in syslog,
but at least the system can resume after suspend.
