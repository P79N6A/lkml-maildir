Sure, if it's just a static response and there's no content-negotiation
going on.

If you intend to implement HTTP, and you intend to use the Last-Modified
or Expires headers, then you MUST include a Date header.  See rev-06 of
the update to rfc2068 for more clarification.
And given that static responses are the best places where Last-Modified
and Expires can be used... it seems silly to omit them.
But then, they just slow down benchmarks, so carry on, carry on.
