I was talking about hibernation image encryption.  Arguably, if the image is
encrypted, you don't need to worry about its contents, including the keys for
other kinds of encryption (eg. fs encryption).

If the image is encrypted, its contents are not available to anyone
unauthorized and that includes the filesystem/swap decryption keys.

Provided that there are any sensitive (to the user or her employer etc.) data
in the notebook.
