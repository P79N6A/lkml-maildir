 contains a patch for kdb
v1.5 against 2.4.0-test9-pre8.
Changes from kdb v1.5-beta2.
* Upgrade to 2.4.0-test9-pre8.
* Fix premature NMI oops on machines with large numbers of cpus.
This version of kdb also includes :-
* NMI oopser for uniprocessors.  This builds on Keir Fraser's excellent
  patch for activating the local APIC on P6 systems and (ab)uses the
  local APIC to generate NMI on systems which have a local APIC but no
  IO-APIC, typically any P6 and above uniprocessor.  So you poor
  developers with uniprocessors can now get diagnostics when the system
  gets into a spin loop.
  On the Processor configuration menu, select 'APIC and IO-APIC support
  on uniprocessors'.  That option will detect the local APIC if it
  exists.  See the help for 'NMI watchdog active for uniprocessors' and
  Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt.
Expect the configuration method and the use of /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
to change in future.  Ingo Molnar and I are discussing how much of the
NMI oopser for uniprocessors should go into the standard kernel.
