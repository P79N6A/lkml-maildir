For anyone fighting with this little gem:
  "virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map"
in lk 2.5.4-pre4 ... you should read
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt and change lots of 
code. Alternatively you may be pleased to know that 
__pa() still works as a replacement for virt_to_bus()
on i386. [Also __va() instead of bus_to_virt() .]
Since my system uses an advansys SCSI adapter I
have been rather busy. There is an impressive
list of "pre3" breakages on my system:
  ide-dma.c   [patch from Jens on lkml]
  ide-scsi.c    "      "
  sg.c          "      "
  advansys.c
  scsi_debug   [simple fix]
  usb/storage/debug.c  [simple fix]
  sound.c    [too tired]
  ...
$ uname -a
Linux frig 2.5.4-pre3 #72 Thu Feb 7 23:24:06 EST 2002 i686 unknown
Please accompany any flames with the correct "pci_map"
patch to the advansys driver:-)
