I still don't think it's worth the trouble.  There's currently only one
reported device which forgets to raise IRQ on media error.  The behavior
is out of spec and rare.  I don't think it's a good idea to change EH
behavior for it.

Old IDE often locks up the machine hard after timeouts.  I'm all for
gathering more info but benefit vs. risk equation just doesn't look good
here.  Why take risk for a rare device which forgets to raise IRQ on
media error?  If such behavior is wide spread among PATA drives && we
can verify that TF register access after timeout is safe for PATA
controllers, sure, but currently we aren't sure about either.
Thanks.
