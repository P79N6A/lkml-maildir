Andrew,
I will reply to your comments in details.

Yes, Tony is right.
For several sampling measurments which are using events that occur very
frequently such as branches, it becomes very important to avoid getting
in lockstep with the execution. Using prime numbers is not always enough
and randomization is the best way to solve this problem.
We have ecountered this when David Mosberger was developing
q-syscollect for Linux/IA64. This tool is sampling return branches
using the MckInley Branch Trace Buffer. With the collected samples
it is possible to build a statistical call graph (a la gprof).
Without randomization, the samples were so biased that the data
was unusable. With randomization, the data was very close to actual
call graph as measured by gprof. The same argument applies to
sampling for cache misses, you want to make sure you are not
always capturing the same cache misses. 
The random number generator does not have to be super fancy. That's why
we use the Carta algorithm, it is simple and fast and gives us very
good samples.
