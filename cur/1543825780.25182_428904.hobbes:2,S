I looked at 
www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-rc-fixes-2.6.git;.
This patch does the following change:
- int nr_pages = (bufflen + PAGE_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
+ int nr_pages = PAGE_ALIGN(bufflen + sgl[0].offset);
This seems to wrong: the new version is missing the right shift. For 
instance, offset=0 and bufflen=4096 results in 4096 and not 1!
(Using asm-x86_64, the new version translates to
((bufflen + sgl[0].offset+PAGE_SIZE-1)&(~(PAGE_SIZE-1)))
)
According to the original patch by Brian, the change should probably have 
been to (or something equivalent):
+       int nr_pages = (bufflen + sgl[0].offset + PAGE_SIZE - 1) >> 
PAGE_SHIFT;
This was tested by several people. Did anyone test the version put into 
scsi-rc-fixes-2.6.git?
