Running knfsd 1.2.2a on kernel 2.2.6. Getting a LOT of these. NFS
debugging is off. Machine is talking to a heavily patched Solaris
2.5.1 machine. Pretty sure the Sun machine is the server (need to
check with the user on his pattern.) Anyone care to interpret? This
looks like the error I used to get when we got data corruption.
