If you disable IDE_DMA, then the other chipset drivers cannot be
enabled --- the config system won't let you.
With IDE_DMA disabled and all chipsets disabled, I see:
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x9f8bc): In function `ide_hwif_setup_dma':
: undefined reference to `ide_setup_dma'
And *that's* what my patch was supposed to fix.
