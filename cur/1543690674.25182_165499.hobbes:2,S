I think it would be faster to hide the "if (mmio)" part into an
inline function which calls one or the other, given a resource cookie.
Branch prediction will remove most of the cost of a conditional test,
which is always the same in these drivers after all, but I don't think
it's quite so good at predicting indirect function calls.
