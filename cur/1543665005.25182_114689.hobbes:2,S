Hi Jeff,
I compiled a plain -pre5 just for you  ;-)
Yes, the difference apparently has nothing to do with Alan.  And (as
another data point) I tried 2.5.64 and I find exactly the same problem
with the Broadcom chip:  if I do the ifconfig down/up cycle the chip
starts working normally again.  I haven't played with 2.5.x very much
so I can't tell you when the Broadcom problem started there.  If you
have a theory to test, I could compile an older 2.5 if you like.
