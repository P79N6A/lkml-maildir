Subject: reproducable lockup on changing DMA state (2.4.22, cmd649)

 changing DMA state (hdparm -d0/1) always lockups my system
(2.4.21/2.4.22) if another drive does heavy I/O on same channel in DMA
mode.. there's no problem if the another drive's in PIO mode or there's
no I/O..
 the biggest problem, that the kernel itself tries to change DMA state
if DMA timeout occurs and it's lockups the system too..  I've a machine
with 28 IDE disks on plain CMD649 controllers, and lots of lockups
happens when a disk going to die soon.. :(
