Hello,
I was wondering if there has been some development concerning the northbridge 
disconnection bit and the joined apm saving you can do... I have an amd box, 
and it is running rather warm... during the periods that it isn't doing 
anything, i would love to have it 'reduce the heat'...
I've found the vcool page on the net, but it's an linux-2.4.13 patch... and 
we're at 17 (stable)... even though i'll probably be able to apply it (with 
some offsets), i am wondering what the status is.
Thanks!
DK
