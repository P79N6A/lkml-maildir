On this controler I have :
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: IBM      Model: DDRS-39130D      Rev: DC1B
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 15 Lun: 00
  Vendor: SEAGATE  Model: ST336706LW       Rev: 0108
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 03
Should I change anything in the BIOS ?
