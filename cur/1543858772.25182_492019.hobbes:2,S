Arjan,
The P3 box with nfs root uses the "ati" X11 driver with:
0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Rage Mobility P/M AGP 2x (rev 64)
The P4 box with nfs /home uses the "i810" X11 driver with:
0000:00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corp. 82865G Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)
Thanks, Michal
