Please change the lines that you have mentioned to this:
buf_printf(b, " .name = KBUILD_MODNAME,\n"); 
modname_flags = $(if $(filter 1,$(words $(modname))),-D'DUM(a)=\#a'
-D'KBUILD_MODNAME=DUM($(subst $(comma),_,$(subst -,_,$(modname))))')
 
Let me know your results.Take care of the quotes while you change.
