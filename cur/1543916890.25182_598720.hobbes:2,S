in unionfs debug.c:
#if BITS_PER_LONG == 32
#define POISONED_PTR		((void*) 0x5a5a5a5a)
#elif BITS_PER_LONG == 64
#define POISONED_PTR		((void*) 0x5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a)
#else
#error Unknown BITS_PER_LONG value
#endif /* BITS_PER_LONG != known */
We try to keep all poison values in include/linux/poison.h so that
when digging around for them, it's easier to locate the one in
question.
Also, on x86_64, the 64-bit version wants a L or UL suffix:
fs/unionfs/debug.c:96:30: warning: constant 0x5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a is so big it is long
fs/unionfs/debug.c:264:30: warning: constant 0x5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a is so big it is long
