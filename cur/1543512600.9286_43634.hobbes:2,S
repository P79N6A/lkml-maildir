Hi!
How can I set a hard disk power down timeout on a SCSI-disk?
I have a very loud SCSI disk which is often not used for a long time, so
setting a hard disk powerdown could reduce the noise of the computer
significantly when the disk is idle and spins down.
I know there is hdparm (I have version 3.3) available for IDE disks, but
that does not work on SCSI disks.
Is there a tool available for SCSI disks?
Greetings, Michael
