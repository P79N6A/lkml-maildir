Can you do one quick change in the driver?
Search for 'pci_set_dma_mask()' API calls in the driver and mask out one of them with DMA_64BIT_MASK as follow.
---
	// if (pci_set_dma_mask(adapter->pdev, DMA_64BIT_MASK) != 0) {
	// 	conlog(CL_ANN, (KERN_WARNING
	// 		"megaraid: could not set DMA mask for 64-bit.\n"));
	// 	goto out_free_sysfs_res;
	// }
---
I found that the driver is NOT checking 64-bit DMA capability of the controllers accordingly and this could be a reason.
I'm waiting for feedback from F/W team for MegaRAID 150-4 controller if it supports 64-bit DMA.
I'll update here as I get.
Thank you,
