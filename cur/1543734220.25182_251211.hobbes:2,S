 thanks alan because i wouldn't have known to look for the PCM switch
 if you hadn't mentioned it.
 my sincere apologies for taking up people's time on this one:
 a CMedia 9739 on a VIA V8235 motherboard _is_ supported...
 ... using kmix you just have to remember to flick all of the
 pretty little lights on, including the PCM "switch" which is
 of course on a different page.
 the defaults for aaaallllll switches and i mean every single one
 is yep, you guessed it: off.
 switch them on, and it works hunky-dory.
 the only thing i _would_ mention that's useful info is that
 i've set dxs_support=4 for the snd_via_82xx module: i notice
 some syslog comments asking people to report this one.
