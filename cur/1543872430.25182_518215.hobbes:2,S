the emphasis here is on 'from inside' which basically
boils down to the following:
 if you create a 'resource container' to limit the
 usage of a set of resources for the processes
 belonging to this container, it would be kind of
 defeating the purpose, if you'd allow the processes
 to manipulate their limits, no?

the above doesn't mean that there aren't processes
_outside_ the resource container which have the
necessary capabilities to manipulate the container
in any way (changing limits dynamically, moving
tasks in and out of the container, etc ...)
