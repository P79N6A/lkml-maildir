Mine does differ, but it is dynamic:
$ ldd /bin/bash
        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xffffe000)
        libtermcap.so.2 => /lib/libtermcap.so.2 (0x4d5b5000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x4d3b4000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0x4d254000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x4d238000)

How about using sash?  That is statically linked.

That sounds like some program is trying to write to it.
Hm, there is a patch in the Red Hat version of udev that basically makes
udev do the start_udev logic, in the .c file because they do not have a
shell in their initrd.  If you can dig it out of there, that might be a
solution for you to use.
Other than that, how about running strace on start_udev when your rc.S
script calls it?  That might help out.
thanks,
