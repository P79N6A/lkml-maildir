This has nothing to do with linux-kernel.
The routine ftime is obsolete, but inspection of its source
shows
	timebuf->millitm = 0;
(in sysdeps/generic/ftime.c).
The more desirable
	timebuf->millitm = (tv.tv_usec + 999) / 1000;
is found only in sysdeps/unix/bsd/ftime.c,
while linux uses the buggy generic version.
So, I updated the man page:
...
BUGS
       Under  libc4  and  libc5  the millitm field is meaningful.
       But glibc2 is buggy and returns 0 there.
HISTORY
       The ftime function appeared in 4.2BSD.

[Indeed, a random libc4 machine (with Linux 1.2.11) says
# ./timebug
It's now 926378129.583
It's now 926378129.605
