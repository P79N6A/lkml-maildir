It makes a big big difference on a low memory box. Try running xfce on
a 24Mb box with the base 2.4.18, 2.4.18 + rmap12f and 2.4.18+aa. Thats
a case where aa definitely loses and without other I/O patches being
applied. Its an X11 based workload with a -lot- of shared pages. Both
rmap and aa materially outperform 2.4.18 base on this workload (and 2.4.17
blew up with out of memory errors)
