It does work, but the current one available is for 2.2.10.
There seem to be some problems with it on newer kernels.
I can play CD's, and it sounds fine, but if I play MP3s,
they stutter a lot, and sound wierd like as if one of
the environmental audio effects is on.
I'd be very surprised if the module worked on 2.3.x
given the amount of changes that have taken place.
Unfortunatly until Creative release the source code,
there's nothing that anyone other than themselves can do
about it.
regards,
Dave.
