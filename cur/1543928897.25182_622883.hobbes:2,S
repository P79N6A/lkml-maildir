Right. Once you leave this, weirdness happens.
POSIX defines things in terms of processes and threads.
POSIX defines many of our interfaces. That includes
kernel behavior, the C library, and numerous programs.

I wasn't saying procps would break, though it would if
/proc/self/task went away. I'm more concerned about
multi-threaded things that look in their own /proc/self
directory. The procps programs are single-threaded.
In procps, the self link is used:
a. to see if the wchan file exists
b. to see if the task directory exists
c. to find the tty number
(that last one: there might not be a file descriptor
for the tty, and anyway I need it with the bits in all
the same places as what I get for the other processes)
I'll bet that something reads /proc/self/stat to see
CPU usage.

For the stuff that is logically per-task, yes.
For the rest, no. Oh well...
It does make things better because redundant info
is a source of confusion.

Heh. Well, /proc/self used to ask for per process data.
It was all the same. I think it matters that /proc/self was
always documented as being per-process.

Nice.

Having the filesystem namespace be per-process is wild enough.
We really don't need it to be per-thread. (and yes, I'm using the
POSIX terms on purpose)

People look at me like I have two heads when I explain to
them that the Linux kernel source uses "pid" to mean
a thread. The bad terminology probably promotes bad thinking.
It would be lovely if that could somehow get fixed.

My "favorite" is the multi-threaded debugger. By this I
mean the debugger itself wants to be multi-threaded,
issuing ptrace commands from multiple threads.
