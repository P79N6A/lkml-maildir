Yes, it is :) I've been running Albert's fixed procps since he pointed
towards it and it's sweet as a pie. Not only works better, but looks better,
feels better, and intuitively works exactly as you want. It's cool++, it's
super, it's perfect. Upgrading isn't a bit of pain, and I hadn't noticed
the change -- until I tried to use ps on our other (linux, BSDI, SunOS,
Solaris) boxes, and noticed the lack of information. Upgrade, its worth the
5m it takes to compile. Really it is.

BTW, Albert, I couldn't find any changes file between procps-981104 and
procps-990103, and the older one is still the only link on your homepage...
intentional ?
