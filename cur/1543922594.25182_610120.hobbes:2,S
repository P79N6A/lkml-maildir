This is very helpful.  Jon Smirl's answer seems to give the
rationale for supporting printk output in interrupt context.
I'm not sure, however, if extending the interrupt off period
to cover the console output is required.  It didn't until
Ingo changed it in 2.6.17. Maybe this was intentional to
allow printk output to drain before another (printk in
interrupt context) could even possibly be generated, but it
seems like overkill.
I'll continue looking at this.  It helps a lot to know about
the issues discussed in the prior thread.
Thanks,
