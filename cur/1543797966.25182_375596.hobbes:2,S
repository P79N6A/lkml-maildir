defconfig files are virtually never a configuration for the kernel they 
are shipped with since they aren't updated every time some configuration 
option is changed.
Consider a defconfig with CONFIG_BROKEN=n, and a driver that is enabled 
in this defconfig gets for some reason marked as broken in the Kconfig 
file - this will give exactly the same result as the one you describe.
