Couldn't agree more here. Although I usually hate <aol>-like
me too posts. I think that its really quite important for the 
state of the ide layer that the work thats already gone into
it isn't lost.
IMO this is not something that you can see a positive, or as a 
lesson learned. This to me just seems like a lot of hard work 
going down the drain.
So, pleeease Bartlomiej/Alan/Jens, whoever. Someone step up
to get most/some of Marcin' cleanup patches into 2.5 again.
