Ahh.
In fact, it should be replaced by a single bit.
Passing in a "zone *" and then using it purely as a boolean makes no

But that still makes me ask: why do you have that (misnamed, and
mis-typed) boolean there in the first place? Why not just unconditionally
have the "zone_shortage(page->zone)"?
