It looked like it was sharing IRQ with another piece of hardware, when I
remove all other hardware, the card runs just fine.
The insmod-msg I recieved with shared IRQ:
...
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 00:14.0
PCI Sharing IRQ 5 with 00:13.0
eth0: SMC EZ Card 10/100 rev 17 at 0xc800, 00:04:E2:3D:AB:52, IRQ 5.
