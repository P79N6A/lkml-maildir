Let's take a look at the chances. 30 terabytes is, in a best-case scenario 
(with 512-byte blocks) about 6e10 blocks. That would be roughly 
6e10*6e10*(2**(-128)), or about 1e-17. With a hundred million machines, the 
chances of a collision would be about 1e-9, disregarding the fact that all 
these machines have a large chance of containing similar blocks -- their data 
isn't truly random, so some blocks have a larger chance of occurring than 
others. The data sets on the machines are probably reasonably static, so if 
the collision isn't found *at once* the chances of it occurring later are 
much smaller. So, even under the most positive assumptions, with a hundred 
million machines with 30 terabytes of storage each, it's extremely probable 
that you won't find a collision. (A 96-bit hash could have been broken with 
this setup however. :) )
