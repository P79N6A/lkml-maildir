It's not that sparse can't handle it, the warning is valid,
_____r and ______f are shadowed when these get nested.  It
gets even worse when interacting with likely/unlikely tracing
as that chose the same identifiers too.  So there the noise
could be drastically reduced changing the different identifiers
for the if () and __branch_check macros, but nesting will always
warn.
I've just been setting this to no in my allyesconfig sparse
runs....just wait until kmemtrace gets to mainline, then it
gets really bad :(
Cheers,
