All linux libc's do this.  glibc, dietlibc, and uclibc.
Beyond this if you really object you can come up with a set of header
that just describe the kernel/user space ABI, and build them so either
the kernel or user space can use them.  And then this ABI-headers
package can be used to hold the common definitions.
Until someone builds a kernel-abi-headers package everyone will do it
by copying the appropriate headers periodically.
