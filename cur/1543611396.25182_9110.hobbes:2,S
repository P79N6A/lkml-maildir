hmm.. interesting.  I agree with you that this is a softirq tasklet
scheduling problem, not just related to the keyboard tasklet.  According
to the rules you stated, the tasklet_trylock(t) is bogus and can be
removed.  So what you suggest is to reschedule the tasklet, but not
raise the pending bit if the tasklet is disabled.  I can live with that
:)
I will produce and test a patch based on this tonight.

Sorry, I am running (available from cvs.parisc-linux.org)
Linux vega 2.4.16-pa5 #2 SMP Thu Nov 29 21:35:27 MST 2001 parisc unknown
Since this code is arch independent, it is very similar to the 2.4.16
kernel.  (Before posting to the list, I did verify that this problem
existed in the 2.4.16 kernel, and the code paths were the same.)
The reason I tracked this problem down was, if I enabled CONFIG_SMP
(C200+ is a single processor system), the system would "hang" after the
following bootup message:
Based upon Swansea University Computer Society NET3.039
UP kernels worked fine, but SMP kernels would "hang" every time.  I
still do not understand why toggling CONFIG_SMP triggered this "hang",
but it did.  Looks I need to keep digging further and try to understand
why CONFIG_SMP "hangs" the system.

Thanks for your feedback George!
