It needs to be able to store flags (like close-on-exec, and maybe more) 
together with a file*.

Right now, I'm working on a patch that uses fdmap even for legacy 
(sequential) fd allocations. With a cleaner interface, w/out having code 
all around the kernel that access fdtable members directly. This should 
cut some code WRT using two different allocators (code in fs/file.c will 
almost zip-away), and maybe it'll look even better and have some new 
comments too ;)
It can be, in theory, completely abstracted and moved into lib/. I'll look 
into it once I completed the first cleanup, assuming the whole thing won't 
look worse than before :)
