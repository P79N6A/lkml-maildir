Let's think about this a little more carefully.  IMHO, making
"modules_install" is the wrong place to do this:
1. When we haven't compiled any modules, we're not going to make
   modules_install in addition to make install.  Therefore this
   link will not be set up.
2. What if the machine you're making modules_install on isn't the
   machine that you're compiling other kernel modules packages on?
   In this case, the compilation machine has no sight of the
   symlink.
However, its fine for your single-box only setup where your kernel is
compiled on the same machine that its run on.
Or am I missing something fundamental here?
