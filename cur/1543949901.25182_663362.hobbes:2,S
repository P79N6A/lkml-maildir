Unfortunately this doesn't fix a problem I've discussed off-list with
Kiyoshi Ueda, who suggested that I should follow this thread and try
any patches posted here.
Here is what happens when I try to mount a CD (before and after I
pull 'for-linus'):
hdc: ide_cd_check_ireason: wrong transfer direction!
cdrom: failed setting lba address space
hdc: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }

ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 3
ISOFS: changing to secondary root
VFS: busy inodes on changed media.
The mount can take from 5 seconds on up to a minute or so before the
CD can be accessed.
