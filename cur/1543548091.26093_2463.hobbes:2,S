I also have a Sound Blaster Awe32; but mine is jumperless and doesn't
respond to isapnp.
It lives happily on io220, irq5, dma1,5 etc.
I have the values set as options in /etc/conf.modules

Mine works fine <tm> in test6 and earlier, but does NOT like test7. I
have posted this 
before to lkml (Subject: "modprobe sound" causing oops under test7 /
test8-pre1)
but received no replies :(
Brief recap: test7 spits out with "sb: I/O region in use." and then some
dma left 
allocated messages (printk'd as the module shuts down I believe).
Subsequently cat'ing /proc/interrupts or /proc/ioports oopses reliably
(reliable oops?)
test8-pre1 locks the machine tight on "modprobe sound", and test8-pre2
is about as polite(!) 
as test7
I'm waiting for the truncate "issues" to settle before looking into it
again.

Ooh! Same motherboard, but again, everything Works Fine <tm> with older
kernels
There appears to have been a fair few changes in the kernel regarding
sound, and even such 
things as MOD_INC_USE() and variants have been moved / restructured;
possibly something wasn't
quite altered correctly :(
