I care about maintainability (evolutions and corrections) and portability. 
Modern applications are generally _large_ and it is not an option to
reimplement it completely in order to make it run under another O/S. Large
applications may live a long time and have to be maintained by people that
haven't been involved in the initial implementation and design.
Following colors that are in fashion is not the right way to deal with 
the long term. Each time you go in the wrong direction, you will pay it 
a lot.
Gérard.
