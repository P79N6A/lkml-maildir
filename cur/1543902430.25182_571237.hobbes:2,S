Of course. Here's the output:
NewServer-RD:~ # hdparm -tT /dev/md2
/dev/md2:
 Timing cached reads:   1738 MB in  2.00 seconds = 868.93 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  444 MB in  3.01 seconds = 147.69 MB/sec
NewServer-RD:~ # hdparm --direct -tT /dev/md2
/dev/md2:
 Timing O_DIRECT cached reads:   290 MB in  2.01 seconds = 144.05 MB/sec
 Timing O_DIRECT disk reads:  396 MB in  3.01 seconds = 131.75 MB/sec
