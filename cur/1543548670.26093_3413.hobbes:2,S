   [1] I understand the RAID issue with disk format compatibility, which
       makes the current RAID patch unacceptable for official 2.2 usage.
       I just wish somebody would *solve* that issue.[2]
   [2] Having complained about a problem, have I just volunteered myself
       to solve it?  (HHOS)
It's an especially amusing situation especially since no vendor has
shipped a distribution without the raid patches applied to their
kernel for almost 2 years now.
I'd say at least 9 out of 10 people using raid, are using the raid
patches.
In fact you could almost consider it a bug that stock 2.2.x kernels
are not on-disk compatible with 9 out of 10 raid installations out
there :-)
