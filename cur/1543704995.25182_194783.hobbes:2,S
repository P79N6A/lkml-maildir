I disagree about both b) and c).  In particular, you would always
write "sizeof variable" (since "sizeofvariable" wouldn't even compile)
and there's no sense in fooling people into thinking sizeof is a
function.  Similarly I like the space after the () operator (although
you could argue we don't put space after a unary - operator).
