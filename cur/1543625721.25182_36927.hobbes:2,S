I can verify Danijel's report -- I have the same setup
(VT8363+VT8353, a.k.a. ProSavage KM133), and I experience the
same screen corruption.  Clearing only bit 7 of register 55 fixes
the problem; clearing bits 5 and 6 causes the video to go all
borky.  There's been another thread about it on lkml over the
last week or so.

Heh, a VIA contact who knows what the hell that register does
would be nice :).
In the meantime, I'd probably suggest a patch which looks for
clears only bit 7 of Rx55 if an 8363 and an 8365 is found.  I'll
whip one up later today.
