That is why I asked if the refrigerator would preempt processes or not. 
AFAICS there is no path where the "struct module *" that is returned is 
used after a voluntary preemption point, so it should be safe. I might 
be missing something, though.
However, this isn't very robust. Since the functions are still returning 
pointers to module data, some changes in the future might keep the 
pointer, and use it after a valid freezing point -> oops.

That depends on the roadmap: if we think the freezer approach is the 
best in the long run, maybe your less intrusive (in the sense that it 
changes less stuff) patch should go in now (as a quick fix to mainline) 
so that after we've sorted out the bugs from the freezer in -mm, it will 
be easier to revert.
However, if we think the most reliable solution would be to not return 
internal module information through pointers and keep all that logic 
internal to module.c, then the "proto-patch" with some improvements 
might be the way to go...
