I would suggest taking it one small step farther and putting everything in 
their own subdirectory. Like arch/i386/kernel/timer/, at least for now. IF 
we ever get an arch/i386/driver/ subdir, it's simple enough to move the 
dir. One way or another, it unclutters the directory while achieving the 
same cleanup.
