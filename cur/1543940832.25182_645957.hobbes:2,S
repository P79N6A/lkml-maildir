Sounds very plausible.

Yup.  That fixes the build ... the resulting binary doesn't boot though :-(
I just realized that it has been a while since I tried booting a UP
kernel ... so the problem may be unrelated bitrot elsewhere.
Overall you are right that the mca_asm.S code should not be dependent on
the relative location of the data objects.
I'll start digging on why this doesn't boot ... but you might as well
send the fixes so far upstream to Linus so that the SMP fix is available
(which is all anyone really cares about ... there are very, very few
UP ia64 systems in existence).
