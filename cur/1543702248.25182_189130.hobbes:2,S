NFS is a good example of why the guarantees of mempool are being
overstated - it still needs to allocate SKBs to make progress and
preallocating a pool for other data structures can make that fail
where it otherwise might not. The pool size for NFS (32) is also
completely arbitrary as far as I can tell.

The API _does_ work. It was a best effort with buffering before, it's
a best effort without buffering now.
