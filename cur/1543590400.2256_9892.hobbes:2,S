In my first patch it is really 4096 bytes, but yes I agree we should
change that to PAGE_CACHE_SIZE. The _only_ reason it's 4096 fixed bytes is that
I wasn't sure all the device drivers out there can digest a bh->b_size of
8k/32k/64k (for the non x86 archs) and I checked the minimal PAGE_SIZE
supported by linux is 4k. If Jens says I can sumbit 64k b_size without
any problem for all the relevant blkdevices then I will change that in a
jiffy ;). Anyways changing that is truly easy, just define
BUFFERED_BLOCKSIZE to PAGE_CACHE_SIZE instad of 4096 (plus the .._BITS as
well) and it should do the trick automatically. So for now I only cared
to make it easy to change that.

I wouldn't be that trivial to drop it, not much different than dropping
it when a fs has a 4k blocksize. I think the dynamic allocation of the
bh is not that a bad thing, or at least it's an orthogonal problem to
moving the blkdev in pagecache ;).

so you mean the device driver should make sure blk_size is PAGE_CACHE_SIZE
aligned and to take care of writing zero in the pagecache beyond the end
of the device? That would be fine from my part but I'm not yet sure
that's the cleanest manner to handle that.

that's a bug indeed (a minor one at least because all the relevant
blkdevices initialize such array and if it's not initialized you notice
before you can make any damage ;), thanks for pointing it out!
