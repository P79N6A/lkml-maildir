I bet it's not just you.  And I bet you have a single-processor
system, and right this moment, you have a file in /usr/src/linux
named 'Makefile.rej'.
Check the contents of Makefile.rej.  There is probably one chunk in
there, and this one chunk does two things: it updates the version number,
and it deletes the paragraph about SMP.
Just apply those changes by hand.
Yes, it does cause some disruption to patch a section of Makefile that
thousand of people have been editing by hand, but the point is that you
*won't* ever again have to patch Makefile to set or unset SMP.
