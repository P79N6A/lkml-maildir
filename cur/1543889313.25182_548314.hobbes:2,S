>Has there been any measurable benefit yet due to tail padding?
We don't have data that tail padding actually helps. It all
depends on what data the linker lays out in the cachelines.
As of now we just want to create the infrastructure (so that
more and more people who need it, can use it).

S390 folks or others might help get the data. I don't have other
machines
on hand.
Thanks.
