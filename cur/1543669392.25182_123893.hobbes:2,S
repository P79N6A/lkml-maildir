Hi,
I have a Asus CUV266-DLS motherboard, with a as99127f hardware monitor
chip. This is supposed to be supported by the W83781D sensor driver.
But, I'm I not supposed to get something under /sys/bus/i2c? Now it's
only my tv-card that is listed as a device.

Have I a somewhat incompatible motherboard? The chip on the board _is_ a
as99127f, seen with my own eyes :) Or is there some other option I need?
Thanks,
Best regards,
Stian
