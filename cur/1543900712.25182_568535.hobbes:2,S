Well, I think that the $subject patch is unnecessary and confusing.  Instead,
I'd like to have a separate interface to invoke the feature provided by the
second patch.
What the second patch achieves, as far as I understand it, is the ability to be
able to jump between two kernels back and forth, on i386.  Although it may
generally be useful for hibernation, IMO it has very little to it right now,
because _many_ important elements of the infrastructure are still needed.
Greetings,
Rafael
