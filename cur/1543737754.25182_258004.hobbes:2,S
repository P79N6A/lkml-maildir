OK - high latency code paths: It doesn't hide critical section latency.
I suppose you could say it hides cond_resched latency (the important
metric for !preempt kernels), but people who care about latency should
enable preempt; those that don't won't (to a point - I agree !preempt
latency needs to be kept in check with the *occasional* cond_resched).
I can't imagine it should hide any bugs though...

I really don't see the requirement to have less than a few ms latency
without preempt.

So the "necessary fixes" would be adding more cond_resched checks,
right? In that case, I disagree with your assumption that the fix is
necessary (again, to a point. We don't want 10s of ms latency).
