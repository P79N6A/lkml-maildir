Er, why on earth is it 'autoconf' tho?  This isn't something that's
necessaryily a CONFIG_xxx issue, it's a 'compile this for me' issue.

And why wouldn't the two match?  If you're running a vendor-provided
kernel, /boot/config-`uname -r` should be the config for the
vendor-provided kernel (and its source tree)...

2) should never happen.  I'm not talking about a patch (like said what
i2c does traditionally), I'm talking about driver.[ch].

Because they should be the same thing?  And why do you mention 'eventual
running kernel'.  There is a running kernel.  Compile the module, load
the module, work.  No reboot (or kernel recompile) needed.
