I don't like this bit.  It's just that all sparc frame buffers happen
to have a mmap method but there's nothing fundamentally arch specific
here.  You should be able to plug a pci video card into any linux
supported machine provided the fb driver does the full setup (which
only very few do in practice, but..)
So I'd just require drivers to have a fb_mmap method and make fb_mmap
the default one.  The page protection cleanup is still nice of course,
but it might make sense to give it a more generic name as it's not
really fb specific.
