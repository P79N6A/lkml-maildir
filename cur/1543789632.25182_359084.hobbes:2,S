Once again here's the patch.
Andrew, can you pull my previous one in favor of this one
I'm one of the rare breeds of programmers that over document, at least I
didn't comment "x equals a plus b" for "x = a + b" but I'm sure Christoph
would say that I was pretty close ;-)
Description:
Found in the -rt patch set.  The scsi_error thread likely will be in the
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state upon exit.  This patch fixes this bug.
Ingo,
I take it that you don't care about the comment for RT.
