I DID IT and discussed it for about 15 minute with Linus at LinuxWorld.
The context of that discussion is closed, but the concerns addressed to me
by Linus have be nailed down.
OH, did I mention that I can do it kernel independent API, and UP/SMP is
not an issue either.....No it is not a new social problem.
I call it CLAPI....pronounced "CLAY PIE", Commerial Linux API
(Was that a serious no brainer for a concept that I started 2+ years ago.)
CLA(Y)	== Easily moldable to need of the vender.
PI	== The endless remainder of vendors, afraid of GPL.
This is all clean and does not break any of the Kernel GPL issues.
This uses all known forms of the GPL/LGPL to create this model.
The final stages were to be tested by the end of 1stQ 2000, but I may lost
the vender.
I will disclose more after I have a chance to float near final design by
Linus and the Gang.
