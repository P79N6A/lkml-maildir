In some cases it will work and in some it is damn hard to make it
work. I am by no way an X expert, I just hacked up a an acceleration
module (from the NetBSD in fact) to work on the NCR chip I have on my
video card).
Geert gave me an example earlier today as to why, let me try to quote
it from memory: One problem is that some X servers (like the Mach64
one) reads memory clock settings from the BIOS on the card instead of
reading them from the registers. The frame buffer driver does not
necessarily use the same settings as in the BIOS and in this case you
may see unpredictable results when running the X server.
What else some X servers will read from board BIOSes is beyond me but
there is a potential danger here. I strongly support the idea of
making the general X server FB aware, whether we refer to it as the
new SVGA server, the FBDev server or something else I expect it to be
the same thing.

I do not say you cannot, I do say there may be problems and therefore
people are lucky if it works - it is not guaranteed to work as in the
example with the Mach64 server.
