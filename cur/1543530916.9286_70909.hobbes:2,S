My patch is for ext2 only.  It adds a new ext2 attribute meaning "this
is an open-by-inode directory".  So you create .inode in a filesystem,
chattr it, and then .inode/<number> refers to a specific inode in that
filesystem.
Being ext2-specific, the patch ensures the correct behaviour when you
try opening a non-existent inode: the entry in .inode doesn't exist.
A little care is needed to avoid negative dentries here.
Because this works, it is safe to use on writable filesystems.  Access
through .inode is determined by the permissions on that directory as
usual, and of course access to the files and directories themselves is
determined by their permission as usual too.
It seems to work very well, but I don't have a use for it so I've never
given it a thorough test.
My patch is better than Donald Becker's for another reason: you can use
it over NFS ;-)
enjoy,
