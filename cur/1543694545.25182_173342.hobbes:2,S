Greetings all,
Here's one I haven't seen before.
After getting an oops with while mounting a freshly made
reiser4 partition, I recompiled with CONFIG_KALLSYMS and
then lilo hung up.  Both process 825 and 4436 are unkillable
with kill -9 in the D state.
The box is still up for now. If I can't get this fixed in the next hour,
it'll have to wait until Monday.  It's a test box, so that's OK.
Any advice?
