really nice changes! The wait-time and hold-time changes should make it 
as capable as lockmeter and more: lockmeter only measured spinlocks, 
while your approach covers all lock types (spinlocks, rwlocks and 
mutexes).
The performance enhancements in -v2 should make it much more scalable 
than your first version was. (in fact i think it should be completely 
scalable as the statistics counters are all per-cpu, so there should be 
no cacheline bouncing at all from this)
Also, you've detached it from CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING so the 
lock-dependency overhead should be gone too.
Looks really good to me!
