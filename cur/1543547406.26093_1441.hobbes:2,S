embedded system whose memory you initialize over the PCI bus (so your boot
loader runs in host userspace).  (I'm doing this for bochs, a friend just
wrote the code for actual ppc hardware).

isn't that what the version string (/proc/version at runtime, start_sys
in the bzImage) is for ?

Most architectures can boot ELF images -- defining section names for
.config.gz and the version string in the ELF file can be done in an
architecture-independent fashion.
