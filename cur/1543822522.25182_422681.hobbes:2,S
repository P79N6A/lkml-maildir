By smart fallback do you mean we should convert the hugetlb fault code
back to using VM_FAULT_SIGBUS and writing userspace sighandlers to do
the same thing I am, but in userspace?  FWIW I did implement that in
libhugetlbfs to try it out, but that seems much dirtier to me than
handling faults in the kernel.
