According to
http://www.infobeat.com/stories/cgi/story.cgi?id=2557828890-57c.
the US will relax its crypto restrictions to a point where exporting
DES is legal.  This potentially means that a lot of stuff that hasn't
been in the kernel now could be integrated.
Is anybody aware of the exact nature of the policy change?  What about
hooks for stronger crypto?  If we're lucky, this means that the core
of the international kernel patch including DES could be distributed
together with the kernel.  This could be a great step forward for the
security of the Internet.
Some US people need to take a closer look at the new restrictions and
maybe even some paperwork needs to be done.
