While on the subject of time, is it possible to get a monotonic timer 
with 1ms or better resolution?
We need this for linux multimedia applications, and it is used to sync 
audio and video. Currently we use gettimeofday(). If a movie is playing, 
and the user goes and changes the time, or changes the timezone, we do 
not want that to effect the movie playing. I have not been able to find 
a monotonic 1ms accurate timer in the linux kernel, that is available to 
applications, and has little overhead. Some efficient ioctl or function 
call for uptime to 1ms accuracy would do perfectly.
