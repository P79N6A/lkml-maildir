Hmm ... this is exactly what EJECT ioctls for some removables do. ide-floppy 
and cdrom for sure. sd does not do it because it does not actually support 
atomic EJECT ioctl so far. I am not interested in anything more than that.

My concern is EJECT implemetation. So far EJECT was handled by individual 
drivers that used private usage counters to decide when drive was free. Now 
CDEJECT is moved into drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c which means that at least 
for IDE and SCSI removables device driver is never entered here. I am looking 
for reliable method to detect busy device on block layer - and yes, the code 
is triggered from ioctl (mostly).
