Subject: [PATCH] permit READ DEFECT DATA in block/scsi_ioctl
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/9/99

The soon to be released smartmontools 5.34 uses the
READ DEFECT DATA command on SCSI disks. A disk that
has defect list entries (or worse, an increasing number
of them) is at risk.
Currently the first invocation of smartctl causes this:
   scsi: unknown opcode 0x37
message to appear the console and in the log.
The READ DEFECT DATA SCSI command does not change
the state of a disk. Its opcode (0x37) is valid for
SBC devices (e.g. disks) and SMC-2 devices (media
changers) where it is called INITIALIZE STATUS ELEMENT
WITH RANGE and again doesn't change the external state
of the device.
The patch is against lk 2.6.13 .
Changelog:
  - mark SCSI opcode 0x37 (READ DEFECT DATA) as
    safe_for_read
