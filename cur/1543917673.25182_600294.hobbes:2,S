I think this "which" is non-restrictive, so it should have a comma
after it (I realize that's not part of your patch). It's also possible
to read it as restrictive, in which case "that" would be preferable.

"A number of people often like to..." is awkward. How about
"Developers sometimes..." or "Too many people..."

You might say "The kernel provides the macros likely()..."

The commas after "passed" and "thread" is unnecessary.

"...by the time it return." should be "...by the time it returns."

This "which" is restrictive; it would be preferable to use "that" instead.

The hyphen isn't necessary when the first word of the compount
adjective is an adverb ending in "-ly", so, just "seemingly rare"; or
switch to "apparently rare".
