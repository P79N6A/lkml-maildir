To be fair, my workload is not really "critical". I'm used to
skip-free audio listening (no matter what) since long time running my
audio player with SCHED_ISO. Even in mainline the skips aren't so
frequent, but still annoying. I'm using SCHED_ISO for the confidence
it gives in providing skip-free audio.
For my modest needs also CFS SCHED_NORMAL has been just fine (in these
latest days). I'll report if I can find a more critical workload that
can possibly stress CFS SCHED_NORMAL.
