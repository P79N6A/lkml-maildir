I would just do it in the write path in raiserfs explicitly - that's what
the standard filesystems do that use the generic block write code (see
fs/buffer.c:
                 * we dirty buffers only after copying the data into
                 * the page - this way we can dirty the buffer even if
                 * the bh is still doing IO.
                 *
                 * NOTE! This also does a direct dirty balace check,
                 * rather than relying on bdflush just waking up every
                 * once in a while. This is to catch (and slow down)
                 * the processes that write tons of buffer..
                 *
                 * Note how we do NOT want to do this in the full block
                 * case: full pages are flushed not by the people who
                 * dirtied them, but by people who need memory. And we
                 * should not penalize them for somebody else writing
                 * lots of dirty pages.
                 */
                set_bit(BH_Uptodate, &bh->b_state);
                if (!test_and_set_bit(BH_Dirty, &bh->b_state)) {
                        __mark_dirty(bh, 0);
                        if (too_many_dirty_buffers)
                                balance_dirty(bh->b_dev);
                }
the comment just about says it all..
