I just checked mutt 1.5.17 in Ubunty Hardy, and it sorts the inodes
even if maildir_header_cache_verify is unset.  (It sorts it earlier if
that option is set, but a little later in the function, if it wasn't
sorted earlier, it sorts it then.)  Check for calls to maildir_sort()
that use md_cmp_inode(); in my version of mutt, there are two such
calls in mh.c:maildir_delayed_parsing().
