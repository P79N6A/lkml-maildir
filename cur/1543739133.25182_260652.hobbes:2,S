Subject: using cc-option in arch/ppc64/boot/Makefile

Hi Sam, I would like to use "cc-option-yn" in arch/ppc64/boot/Makefile.
All recent 64-bit gcc/binutils can produce 32-bit code by passing -m32 (or 
similar) to them. arch/ppc64/boot/zImage is actually a 32-bit executable, and 
the Makefile still requires a separate 32-bit cross-compiler to build it (in 
addition to the 64-bit cross-compiler used for the vmlinux). To decide if 
$(CC) can handle -m32, I'd like to use cc-option-yn (as in 
arch/ppc64/Makefile).
I've tried moving the cc-option stuff out of the top-level Makefile into 
something that can be included from arch/ppc64/boot/Makefile, but so far the 
right magic has escaped me. Any ideas?
