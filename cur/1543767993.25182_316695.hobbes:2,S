Hrm...
	a) stub.S handling breaks on O= builds.   Actually, your unprofile
breaks there - it's bypassing the machinery that deals with include path.
	b) stub_segv.c on amd64 includes <signal.h>.  Not a good idea...
	c) sysdep-x86_64/checksum.h in -rc4 has csum_partial_copy_from_user()
that needs updating (AFAICS, you have that in your patchset, but it hadn't
reached Linus)
	d) ip_compute_csum() prototype is missing (same file)
	e) #define UPT_SYSCALL_RET(r) UPT_RAX(r) is needed in amd64 ptrace.h
	f) take a good look at UPT_SET() in the same file ;-)
	g) CFLAGS_csum-partial.o := -Dcsum_partial=arch_csum_partial in
sys-x86_64/Makefile needs to be removed.
	h) Makefile.rules should be included _after_ SYMLINKS = in the same
file.
	i) sys-x86_64/delay.c needs exports of __udelay() and __const_udelay(),
include of linux/module.h and barriers in your delay loop bodies (or games
with volatile - anything that would guarantee that gcc won't decide to optimize
the entire loop away).  The last part applies to i386 as well.
	j) ip_compute_csum should be exported on amd64.
	k) sys-x86_64/syscalls.c needs include "kern.h"
	l) elf-i386.h should include <asm/user.h>, not "user.h"
	m) elf-x86_64.h lacks R_X86_64_... definitions
	n) WTF _is_ that #ifdef TIF_IA32 in there?  Aside of the trailing \,
we could as well put #error there - free-floating clear_thread_flag(TIF_IA32);
outside of any function body will have that effect anyway.
	o) in drivers/chan_kern.c we have several printf(KERN_ERR "...");
these should become printk, as they clearly had been intended.  As it is,
they give instant panic if we ever call them.
	p) TOP_ADDR in Kconfig_x86_64 got lost in transmission - your patchset
has it, but same patch in Linus' tree does not.
I've got patches for everything except (a); that one is really nasty.  I hope
to sort it out by tonight; if not, I'll just send what I've got by now.
