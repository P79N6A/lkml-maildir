True about RPC/XDR, but NFS isn't XDR.

It becomes improper WHEN it is decided that one user should be in 256 groups.
I wasn't meaning improper as in "should never be done" but more that it is
likely being used for something that it wasn't designed to do.
Now it IS possible to use newgrp to switch groups, and an extension (not
THAT big) can be used to allow a user to switch to any (authorized) group.
It just is not really reasonable to try to be a member of ALL groups ALL the
time.
