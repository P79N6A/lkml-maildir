I see that you merged a few (or one?) of these. (obvious ones)
My review didn't come up with much help, I'm afraid.  And you
already asked for help on the series-of-4 gui-config patches.
actually-delete-the-as-instr-ld-option-tmp-file.patch
	I couldn't find this patch.
pa-risc-fix-bogus-warnings-from-modpost.patch
	looks obvious w/ medium priority
I'm little help on the Makefile changes, sorry.
My -git15 build finds lots of Section mismatch problems with
.parainstructions.  These could be false reports that need a
change in modpost (section checker).  I'll look into that
later today.
