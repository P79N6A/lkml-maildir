Yep.

There are PCMCIA controllers and PCI/PCMCIA/Cardbus adapters for the
Sparc platform I thought ?

NAK - this is the wrong approach. PCI=n ATA=m should compile. Sparc is
not the only problem case. The DMA handling bits of libata are fairly
nicely split out but they are stuck in the same file and unconditionally
compiled in.
I'll have a poke at this when I get a bit of time if Jeff doesn't.
