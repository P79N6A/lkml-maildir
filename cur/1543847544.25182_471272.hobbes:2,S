I see. But if we do send an OCR with an unsupported bit set, the card will
go to inactive state and is unusable. This problem is masked on controllers
with only 3.3V support, but I'm working with a controller supporting several
different voltages.
For example, I have a card giving an OCR reply of 0x0ff80080. The current
code will reply to this with 0x00000180 which is clearly incorrect.
Maybe something like "ocr &= 3 << bit;" would be more approriate?
Cheers,
  Timo
