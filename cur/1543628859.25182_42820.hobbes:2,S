Folks:
Compile config question...
Single processor machine (Pentium III)
SMP comes default "ON" in my 2.5.10 and 2.5.9 config; why is it that if 
I turn it off (since I'm only using one processor) the build breaks?  I 
can post the part it chokes on (I recall something regarding 
cpu_number)...
I this a broken config issue, or is someone/thing have a SMP dependency 
in the 2.5 series?
TIA
Ron
