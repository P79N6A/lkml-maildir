9 mharris@asdf:~/src$ find linux-2.4.0-test9/ -name COPYING
linux-2.4.0-test9/fs/hfs/COPYING
linux-2.4.0-test9/COPYING
linux-2.4.0-test9/drivers/sound/COPYING
I have looked at all 3 files.  All 3 are copies of the GPLv2
license file, with the linux-2.4.0-test9/COPYING one being the
one Linus has added a comment to the top of.
I do not see any reason for including 3 identical copies of the
license.  Linus, please remove the files:
linux-2.4.0-test9/fs/hfs/COPYING,
linux-2.4.0-test9/drivers/sound/COPYING
The only other difference found is the address of the FSF
differs between the files.  The FSF's main pages show the GPL
license (the official current copy) as having:
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
02111-1307  USA
So Linus's COPYING file in the source root is correct, and the
other two files can be deleted.
