This patch makes it possible to implement Martin Schwidefsky's
hypervisor-based fast page reclaiming for architectures without
millicode - ie. Xen, UML and all other non-s390 architectures.
That could be a big help in heavily loaded virtualized environments.
The fact that it helps prevent the iSCSI memory deadlock is a
huge bonus too, of course :)
