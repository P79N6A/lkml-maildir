Yup, a warning at the very least.

It better not be, else we have a bug already anyway. Pointers are 64-bit
on 64-bit archs. [ it turns out res->start is resource_size_t which is
set properly as per CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT which itself is set properly
as per CONFIG_64BIT, so everything is healthy and fine :-) ]

Yes, void * -> unsigned long cast is always ok, and what we need here.
