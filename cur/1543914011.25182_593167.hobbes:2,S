I'm seeing this on my 965gm chipset with Andi's clflush patches on x86 
32-bit, it looks like an interaction with the agp code which does a big 
bunch of change page attr to allocate the AGP aperture backed memory..
I think the code might have worked in a previous iteration on my 64-bit 
965G machine at home but I'm on the road and won't be back anytime soon..
I'll see what I can figure out from my laptop...
Dave.
