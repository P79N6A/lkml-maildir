I'm not familiar with the PROT_SEM flag.  I don't believe it to be
defined in POSIX.
However, POSIX does imply levels of cache coherence for both MAP_SHARED
and MAP_PRIVATE:
With MAP_SHARED, any change to the underlying object after the mapping
must become visible to the mapper (although the change may be delayed by
local caching of the changer's implementation until it is explicitly
flushed).
With MAP_PRIVATE it is undefined what happens if the underlying object
is changed after mapping.
So regardless of PROT_SEM we have no choice but to worry about cache
coherence issues on MAP_SHARED mappings.
