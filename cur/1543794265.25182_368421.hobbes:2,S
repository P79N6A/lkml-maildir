actually no. SELinux can't work, we've looked at that bigtime. Basically
/dev/mem has 3 types in one, and to apply security you need different
roles for each in selinux. so the only option to apply selinux
*anything* is to first split /dev/mem up.
types:
1) accessing non-ram memory (eg PCI mmio space) by X and the likes
   (ideally should use sysfs but hey, changing X for this will take 
   forever)
2) accessing bios memory in the lower 1Gb for various emulation like
   purposes (including vbetool and X mode setting)
3) accessing things the kernel sees as RAM
they are very distinct security wise.
