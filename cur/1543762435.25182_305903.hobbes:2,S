Sure, I'll play with it.
Meanwhile, here are some numbers.  I changed just the clear_page()
implementation on sparc64 so that it used prefetching and normal
temporal stores.  The machine is a uniprocessor 1.5Ghz Ultra-IIIi,
64K write-through D-cache, 64K I-cache, 1MB L2 cache.  I did 4
timed 'vmlinux' builds after a fresh boot:
BEFORE:
real	9m8.720s
user	8m28.345s
sys	0m32.734s
real	9m2.034s
user	8m28.763s
sys	0m32.512s
real	9m1.848s
user	8m28.970s
sys	0m32.204s
real	9m1.701s
user	8m28.715s
sys	0m32.394s
AFTER:
real	9m2.241s
user	8m16.633s
sys	0m36.451s
real	8m53.739s
user	8m17.165s
sys	0m36.052s
real	8m54.089s
user	8m17.266s
sys	0m36.219s
real	8m54.071s
user	8m17.473s
sys	0m36.073s
So, at the very least, my results agree with D. Mosberger's on IA64.
At the cost of ~4 seconds of system time, we gain ~11 seconds of
user time.
I'm pretty much convinced this is a win.  I wonder if it matters to
do something similar for copy_page*() as well.
