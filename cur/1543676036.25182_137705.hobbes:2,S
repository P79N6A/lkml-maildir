what is hardmeter
hardmeter is a memory profiling tool using by the performance
monitoring facilities of IA-32 processors.
The tool consists of the following compornent.
 1. Kernel Driver of memory profiling (Linux Kernel Patch)
 2. User Utility (ebs)
 3. User Program API (Application Programming Interface)
Please read the INSTALL.en to install this tool.
* ebs command
You can use ebs command to profile memory traffic. The command syntax
is the following.
Usage: ./ebs (-u | -k) [-o OUTFILE] [-i INTERVAL] [-c COUNT] -t TYPE EXE_OR_PID
  options
    -u           - sample user-mode events
    -k           - sample kernel-mode events
    -o OUTFILE   - store sampled data to file
    -i INTERVAL  - sampling interval(default: 10000)
    -c COUNT     - max sampling count(default: 2000)
    -t TYPE      - event type to sample
    -m NAME,NAME... - event masks
  help options
    -h           - show event types
    -h TYPE      - show event masks
imprecise at-retirement event:
      instr_retired   - instruction retired
      uop_retired     - uops retired
precise front-end event:
      memory_loads    - memory loads
      memory_stores   - memory stores
      memory_moves    - memory loads and stores
precise execution event:
      packed_sp_retired - packed single-precision uop retired
      packed_dp_retired - packed double-precision uop retired
      scaler_sp_retired - scaler single-precision uop retired
      scaler_dp_retired - scaler double-precision uop retired
      64bit_mmx_retired - 64bit SIMD integer uop retired
      128bit_mmx_retired - 128bit SIMD integer uop retired
      x87_fp_retired  - floating point instruction retired
      x87_simd_memory_moves_retired - x87/SIMD store/moves/load uop retired
precise replay event:
      l1_cache_miss   - 1st level cache load miss
      l2_cache_miss   - 2nd level cache load miss
      dtlb_load_miss  - DTLB load miss
      dtlb_stor_miss  - DTLB store miss
      dtlb_all_miss   - DTLB load and store miss
      mob_load_replay_retired - MOB(memory order buffer) causes load replay
      split_load_retired - replayed events at the load port.
Regards,
  Hiro
