I've been up to 4am writing patches. I must be seeing double :-/

I was thinking the same thing.

I didn't like that either. But I was focusing on something else, and I was
getting sick and tired of my box hanging on bootup every once in a while
(usually when I reboot and walk away, just to come back to find the box
hung).
So this was my band-aid, and since it was only happening on the box
running with my patches, I thought it may have been something I did. But
then it finally hung on a reboot to a vanilla kernel, so I decided to at
least send my band-aid out.
If anything, this should get some notice and we can have a proper fix for
.25.
