I guess it would work to schedule a tasklet from your ioctl handler, but
I don't see a good reason to do it.  What are you really trying to do?
Your ioctl handler runs in process context so you are free to do
pretty much anything -- allocate with GFP_KERNEL, sleep, etc.  If you
want to return to userspace immediately but defer some work until
later, it would probably make more sense to use something like
schedule_work() instead of a tasklet.
The main point of tasklets is that they run at a high priority, very
soon after they're scheduled, so that an interrupt handler can return
quickly by deferring work to a tasklet but still not add too much
latency.  But in your ioctl handler, if you have some high priority
work, you can just do it immediately without the complication of a tasklet.
