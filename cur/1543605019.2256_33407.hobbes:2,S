Subject: APM suspend broken in 2.4.12

Hello all.  I just upgraded from 2.4.9 to 2.4.12.  I chose the same kernel
APM options in 2.4.12 as I had in 2.4.9 - CONFIG_APM, CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE
and CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE.  When I try to suspend using my laptop's suspend
key nothing happens.  Trying "apm --suspend" results in "apm: Resource
temporarily unavailable".  Standby still works.
Searching through the archives I see that this problem has been reported
for 2.4.10.  The conversation seemed to die off after it was posited that
some non-APM driver was vetoing the suspend.  The suspects mentioned were
the keyboard driver or something called "A20".  Has anyone done any
further investigation?  Any suggestions as to how I might go about
tracking this down?
Thanks!
