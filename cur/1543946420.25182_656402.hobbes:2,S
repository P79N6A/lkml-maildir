I don't really have any idea. Nothing has been changed in this area  
for a couple of years. The command TX timeout is the timeout that  
indicates a missing answer to a command sent down to the Bluetooth chip.
However this involves some atomic and tasklet stuff. Did we have some  
changes that I missed and might now render this usage as broken.
