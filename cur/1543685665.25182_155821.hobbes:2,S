Ok, the 2.6 client is having trouble with the 2.6 server also, so that
wasn't anything special then.
I have some tcpdump traces from one of the nfs servers that shows the pauses
that are happening in the transmission if anyone would like to take a look.
I'm not sure what else I can do to find out why it is pausing.
Any ideas?
