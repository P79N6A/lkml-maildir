The problem with the 8139 is the fact that the chip design is really
dumb, when I say dumb here, I mean *really* dumb ;-(
The result is that when the card is bombarded with a lot of small
packets it can livelock because the queues fill up faster than the
kernel code can empty and process them.
I made some changes to improve the situation in the driver, for 2.2
kernels, which I have submitted to Jeff and he plans to integrated
them into the next release.
My patched drivers are available from
http://www.wildopensource.com/proj/download/SG_drivers.html
 however I
haven't tested them on 2.4.x, so I am not going to bet on them
working.
Cheers,
Jes
