yes it's unreclaimable memory and that's why we want to minimize how much
is used.
on the other hand there is a factor of reliability in the kernel knowing
what options were used to compile it that you just cannot match with a
seperate file, or even with it a part of the on-disk image that is thrown
out when it gets loaded into memory.
if the distro/sysadmin _always_ installs the kernel the 'right way' then
the difference isn't nessasarily that large, but if you want reliability
on any system it may be worth loosing a page or so of memory (hasn't
someone said that the data can be compressed to <1K?) make it so that you
need a common external tool to use the data and deliver it from the kernel
in compressed form and you don't even need to put the decompression
routine in the kernel (cat /proc/sys/kernel/config |gunzip >config)
