Andrew, can you please consider sticking these into -mm ?
FC6 already has a gcc capable of using this feature (and I hope/assume
other similar distros as well; for other distros using gcc 4.1, the
respective gcc owner should put in
http://www.fenrus.org/stackprotector/gcc41.patch
 to fix PR28281) and
since it's a relatively simple feature patch wise (and entirely off if
the config option is off) I sort of feel 2.6.20 is a long way away..
