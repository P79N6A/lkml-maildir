OK, so there is no f*cking magic utility from IBM to do suspend
of MicroDrives under linux through the TASKFILE interface at all
as you have climed!

Andre Hedrick will may kill you... However apparently we agree that
there is something wrong with the current driver.

No, the problem *is there* Pavel just attempts to FIX IT and I do
nothing but supporting him on this. You can hardly claim that
he hooks the whole up on the wrong place...

Wrong I care. But I still didn't get too this right now.

Trivially right.

So what the heck. Do you thing it will happen overnight!?
Just see how much time it took to get the init tables into
some reasonable shape... and the road is still ahead on the
simple issue of getting them out of ide-pci.c finally!!!
There is only one way of cooperation here - sharing even not quite finished but
not broken code - and I still hold up that this is the case with
Pavels code.

It wasn't a claim but just a suspiction. So this is cleared.
But apparently there is no special IBM command using taskfile
to do magic things to it. So therefore it's still valid:
your example was indeed a mock-up.
For your information: I have read the standard papers and comments
to them. But the application notes from IBM and actual code
from different operating systems gives a much better formal
description of what is needed anyway. Or are you going to claim
that narrative languaue is more precise then actual C code?
