okay, i've created tip/tracing/function-return-tracer topic so that we 
can start testing this for real and do can start iterating it via 
smaller changes. I've also integrated it into tip/master, it's looking 
good so far.
i did a couple of cleanups straight away:
 1) i did a FTRACE_RETURN => FUNCTION_RET_TRACER rename, to move it in
    line with the function tracer
 2) i cleaned up the arch/x86/Kconfig impact:
      f1c4be5: tracing, x86: clean up FUNCTION_RET_TRACER Kconfig
the return-tracer builds and boots, and works fabulously:
 # cd /sys/debug/tracing/
 # cat available_tracers 
 return function sched_switch nop
 # echo return > current_tracer
 
 clocksource_read+0xd/0xf -> acpi_pm_read (1547 ns)
 getnstimeofday+0x3e/0xc8 -> clocksource_read (1951 ns)
 ktime_get_ts+0x25/0x49 -> getnstimeofday (2354 ns)
 ktime_get_ts+0x45/0x49 -> set_normalized_timespec (120 ns)
Small quirk, it does not seem possible to switch from ftrace to 
ftrace-ret:
 # echo ftrace > current_tracer 
 # echo return > current_tracer
 bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
i have to go via the "nop" tracer for this to work. Steve: switching 
between tracer plugins should be seemless.
Question: have you thought about extending the return-tracer to 
dyn-function-tracer?
That's where it will really shine: the dftrace workflow is to 
typically enable a low number of functions - and there the 
return-tracing overhead does not show up nearly as much as in the 
static-function-tracing workflow.
Another suggestion: i think the "return" plugin name is confusing to 
users (it confused me when i first saw it listed in 
available_tracers).
So lets use "function_full" and "function" tracing perhaps? The "full" 
tracer is what traces both entry and exit points, and establishes full 
function-call timings/costs. The "function" tracer is more lightweight 
and traces function entry events.
