Hey, we're talking defaults here.
How many people are running a newsserver on their Linux machine ?
How many of those use a newsserver that uses the one-file-per-post
system ?  Remember this system is getting less and less common.
And even for those OFPP newsservers, the default 4192 bytes per inode
is already too high.
So, no, newsservers are not a good argument here.
Does anyone here have a filesystem where KB-used / inodes-used is
lower than 8192 ?  If so, what kind of data is on it ?
