Subject: test10-pre5 missing file: x25call.h (or bad #include)

Compiling stops with:
make: *** No rule to make target `/usr/src/linux/include/net/x25call.h',
needed by `/usr/src/linux/include/net/x25.h'.  Stop.
I don't have x25 configured.
Looks like this file is removed by the patch, and lots of
references to it is removed.  I guess x25.h is wrong in trying to
include it, but I don't really know.
