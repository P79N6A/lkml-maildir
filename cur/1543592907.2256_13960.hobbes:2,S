CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT must be a derived symbol, not a user selected
symbol.  CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT is 'n' if no gameport drivers are
installed.  It is 'm' if all gameport drivers are modules *and* all
users of gameport_register_port() are modules, otherwise it is 'y'.
With your patch, if a user selects CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT=m and
CONFIG_SOUND_ES1370=y then the built in es1370 driver has unresolved
references to gameport_register_port() which is in a module, vmlinux
will not link.  That is why I derived CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT based on
the config options in two separate directories.
