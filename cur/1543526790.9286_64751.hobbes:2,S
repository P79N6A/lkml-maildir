Hello!
> Do you mean that this will be enough, and similar thing in tty_io.c?
Only not here! synchronize_irq() must follow fasync list modification.
You modify list and then wait for readers. See?
Correct reader will see either list before modification or after modification,
both of them are valid. kill_fasync() is correct reader,
I do not know about tty_io.c.

Personally, I prefer cli()/sti(), because it excludes possibility
for reader to be wrong one. But in 2.2 it is really not crucial.
