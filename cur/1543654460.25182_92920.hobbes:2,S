Hi,
sorry i'm writing here. I've been using the Jedi Knight 2 dedicated
server pretty cool with the 2.2.20 kernel. But now i've upgraded my
kernel to 2.4.19 and it exists with Segmentation Fault. I've logged the
output of strace but i can't understand it (yet). If anyone can help me
i could send that log to him.
thanks,
Szenty
