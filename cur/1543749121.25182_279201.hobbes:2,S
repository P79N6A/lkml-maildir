i deliberately started a test where there was roughly 50% idle time.

i started an infinite loop that generated disk IRQs, and started a
network test that generated network IRQs. The IRQ rate was roughly
10K/sec - this combined with the 10K/sec NMI rate should be an adequate
mix. (I also made sure that it's really default_idle that is used.)
