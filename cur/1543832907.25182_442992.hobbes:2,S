Ouch, nice trick. But how do I actually pull it up? There's nothing
that looks like allowing that in /sys:
root@amd:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:02.0# ls
broken_parity_status  config  irq         power/     subsystem@
uevent
bus@                  device  local_cpus  resource   subsystem_device
vendor
class                 enable  modalias    resource0  subsystem_vendor
root@amd:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:02.0#
I tried going to bus/drivers/ and unbind/rebind ipw2200 driver; that
does not work. I tried echo 0 > enable; echo 1 > enable, but no trick,
either.
