As I read the code, it doesn't make a difference: parisc will take a 
spin lock within the atomic operation and then release it, which makes 
the old fast path for the semaphores and the new fast path pretty much 
equivalent (they both take and release one spinlock).  The only extra 
cost is the address computation for the spinlock.  If there is contention 
for the atomic spinlocks, then parisc can increase the number of buckets 
in their hashed spinlocks.
