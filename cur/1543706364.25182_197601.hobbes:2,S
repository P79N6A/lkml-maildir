I'd rather revert it. If it has broken something, I'm nervous that random 
hacking will just break more. I see the patch that fixes it, but what else 
will now break? Having a magic special case for "brk" is just too damn 
ugly for words.
What I find strange is that bash passed in something else than NULL as the 
argument in the first place. Doing a quick trace of my bash executable 
shows non-NULL hints only for MAP_FIXED mmap's. So what triggered this? 
Random special cases in code are just evil, and end up biting us in the 
end. Which is why I'd rather see the revert, along with more of a look at 
_why_ bash does what it does for you.
