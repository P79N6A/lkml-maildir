Mike, et al,
    one time:  I was told that this group likes bottom posts.
    The logic of class independent code calling class
    scheduling dependent code, assumes that all functions
   are in ALL the class dependent sections.
    Minimally, if I agree with your above statement, I would assume 
    that the function should still exist as a null type function. However,
    in reality,  alot of RT class specific init is done. Just currently 
    none of it is done in this non-existant function.
