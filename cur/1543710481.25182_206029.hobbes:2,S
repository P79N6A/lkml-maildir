Nobody has mentioned the swap cache yet.  If a page is in ram, and swap 
and not dirty, it's counted in the swap cache.

You're saying all anon memory should become swap_cache eventually 
(though, it should be a background "task" so it doesn't block userspace 
memory requests).
That would have other side benefits.  If the anon page matches (I'm not 
calling it "!dirty" since that might have other semantics in the current 
VM) what is in swap, it can be cleaned without performing any IO.  Also, 
  suspending will have much less IO to perform before completion.
Though there would have to be swap recycling algo if swap size < ram.
