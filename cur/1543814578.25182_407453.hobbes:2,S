    Hi Mariusz :)

    I understand. And it's a pity, because LLH is very useful, and
you did a GREAT job with it.

    Yes... XDDD
    Well, I can volunteer to test LLH and contribute a bit, fixing
things I can fix, but IMHO this kind of work should be done by the
kernel itself: it should provide both user-space and kernel-space
headers (yes, I know, "don't-include-kernel-headers-in-userspace".
Tell that to iproute2, iptables, etc...).
    Thanks a lot for your work, your effort and your interest in this
problem. You have done a lot for the linux community (at least,
you've done a lot for me).
