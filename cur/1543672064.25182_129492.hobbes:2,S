There is no way this can be correct.  Look at the formula used
by ip_input.c, which is:
  struct ip_rt_acct *st = ip_rt_acct + 256*smp_processor_id();
So there is only two possibilities, either your patch is wrong
or this code in ip_input.c is wrong.
You probably want to keep IP_RT_ACCT_CPU() how it is, cast _THAT_
to "u8 *" then add in the offset.
Also, you'd get a response more quickly if you had sent this to
the networking development lists (linux-net and netdev@oss.sgi.com)
CC:'ing the networking maintainers (myself and Alexey Kuznetsov).
I came across this posting by pure luck.
linux-kernel is effectively /dev/null for some of us on many days.
Just like ipv4 and ipv6, linux kernel is an unreliable transport.
