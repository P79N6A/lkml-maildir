Isn't that also when the USB system underwent a massive rewrite to fully 
support hotplugging and to fix a lot of bugs that were present in the 
original implementation?
Still, the question I posed in my earlier post remains - why can't you have 
your program do the BTL mappings behind the scenes? You can easily allow it 
from the command line and also allow pointing to a /dev entry... If you want 
I'll actually put together a patch based on whatever version of cdrecord I 
have here on my system and send it to you.
