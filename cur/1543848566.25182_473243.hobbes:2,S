Yes, there seems to be abuse of this new "must_check" feature.

Thing is, a "difference to performance (alone)" != "misbehavior".
If it affected correctness, then a warning would be appropriate.
Most drivers should be able to say "enable MWI if possible, but
don't worry if it's not possible".  Only a few controllers need
additional setup to make MWI actually work ... if they couldn't
do that setup, that'd be worth a warning before they backed off
to run in a non-MWI mode.
