Well, it seems as if I just might have found a temporary fix for the
Nforce APIC Borkage. Using a uniprocessor configured kernel, I would get
lockups running hdparm -t /dev/hda. However, reconfiguring the kernel
for SMP seems to have fixed this.
Please send all input on this either to my email, or the bug I posted on
bugme.osdl.org at : 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2552
One person who replied to that bug states this works. 
(I ask this because I do not have the bandwidth or storage to spare
signing up on this list.)
Thanks,
