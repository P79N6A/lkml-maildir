FYI The lkml FAQ paints a different picture:
  Note that Linus has stated that existing symbols will not be switched to
  GPL-only. Developers of proprietary modules for Linux need not fear.
  Furthermore, it is quite unlikely that Linus will look favourably upon
  the introduction of new core driver APIs which are restricted to
  GPL-only modules. This would not be in the best interests of Linux.
  Linus has forwarded me a message he sent to someone else to clarify his
  views.
