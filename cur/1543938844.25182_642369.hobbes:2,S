Agreed. Here's the patch that should fix it:

Sure.

I think Mel said that their configuration did work with 2.6.23
although I also wonder how that's possible. AFAIK there has been some
changes in the page allocator that might explain this. That is, if
kmem_getpages() returned pages for memoryless node before, bootstrap
would have worked.
