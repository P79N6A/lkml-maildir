This comment was referring to lines such as the following, which appear
a few places in your patch (though not lines you wrote, just nearby
lines, in all but one case):
 		cpumask_t nodemask = node_to_cpumask(cpu_to_node(i));
I was thinking to change such a line to:
 		cpumask_t sibling = node_to_cpumask(cpu_to_node(i));
However, it is no biggie, and since it is not in your actual new
code, probably should not be part of your patch anyway.
There is one place, arch_destroy_sched_domains(), where you added such a
line, but there you should probably use the same 'nodemask' name as the
other couple of places, unless and until these places change together.
So bottom line - nevermind this comment.
