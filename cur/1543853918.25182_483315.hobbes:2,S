Right, will fix.  The 4096 limit is arbitrary anyway, and can be 
replaced by an arbitrary limit on nmsrs.

But why isn't it used again?  Looks like the kernel is forcing the user 
to send at least num_entries for no good reason, and ignoring any 
entries beyond num_entries.

It can't hurt.  Is returning the number of msrs set in the return code 
(ala short write) acceptable, or do I need to make this a read/write ioctl?

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
