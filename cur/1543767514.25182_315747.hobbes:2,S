That's not a problem.
Quoting drivers/usb/misc/sisusbvga/sisusb.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE <= KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,10)
#include <linux/ioctl32.h>
#define SISUSB_OLD_CONFIG_COMPAT
#else
#define SISUSB_NEW_CONFIG_COMPAT
#endif
#endif
I decided not to drop the SISUSB_OLD_CONFIG_COMPAT code in my patch 
because it seems Thomas is sharing this code between different kernel 
versions, and a removal might make his life harder for no big win.
