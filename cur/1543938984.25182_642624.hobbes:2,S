Yes, this is 80-wire cable; both are connected on the same cable. HDD is 
master and DVD is slave. I'll later try disconnecting DVD and see what 
happens. I didn't set cable-select due to how these drives are connected

mobo  hdd   dvd
I think that cable select would take dvd as master and hdd as slave.
This was not preferable when hdd was my primary drive. I can try 
cable-select now since I boot off new SATA drive.
