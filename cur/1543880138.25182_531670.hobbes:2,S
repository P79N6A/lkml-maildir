It is not clear to me that this is always the case, especially once you 
mix in things like resource groups.

Suppose I have a really high priority task running.  Another very high 
priority task wakes up and would normally preempt the first one. 
However, there happens to be another cpu available.  It seems like it 
would be a win if we moved one of those tasks to the available cpu 
immediately so they can both run simultaneously.  This would seem to 
require some communication between the scheduler and the load balancer.
Certainly the above design could introduce a lot of context switching. 
But if my goal is a scheduler that minimizes latency (even at the cost 
of throughput) then that's an acceptable price to pay.
