Ah ok. Thanks. 
2 little questions please?
1. Would it be inappropriate to make it drop back to a different governor so 
that it can be selected?
2. Can cpu throttling be incorporated into this governor as well as a 
secondary mechanism for the lowest cpu frequency and as a primary 
mechanism for those cpus that don't support cpufreq?
Cheers,
Con
