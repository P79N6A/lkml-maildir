True. Am I right in thinking that LILO still uses it?

Do you think there's any chance my patch as posted in the previous
email will get in the kernel, will I need to repost it when the rest
of the patch is finished and that bug is eradicated, or should I just
forget about it as being something that's not worth doing?
Best wishes from Riley.
