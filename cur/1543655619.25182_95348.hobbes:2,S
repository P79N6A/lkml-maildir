Thanks for the clarification. Just wanted to add that following
  Rusty Lynch's hint to ignore the 'missing' issue I successfully
  installed 0.9.3 and they appear to work on 2.5.51 (I was able
  to modprobe vfat - but not the full irda stack, I'll report this
  separately to Jean) _and_ on 2.4.20 (modular IrDA and PPP are
  channeling this message to you - loaded by 0.9.3 :).
