Hmm? I get that to be 227ms per loop, which is way more than a full
timeslice. Running the program took in the range of 2 minutes, so it's
110000 milliseconds, not microseconds.

The math doesn't add up for me. Even if it rebalanced at the end of
the first slice (i.e. after 1ms), that would be a 1ms penalty per
iteration. With 500 threads that'd be a total penalty of 500ms.

Right, likely because the long-running cases got stuck at the busy loop
at the end, which would end up aborting quicker if the other thread got
scheduled for just a bit. It was a mistake to post that variant of the
testcase, it's not as relevant and doesn't mimic the original workload I
was trying to mimic as well as if the first loop was made larger.

There's always the tradeoff of losing cache warmth whenever a thread is
moved, so I'm not sure if it's a good idea to always migrate it at
creation time. It's not a simple problem, really.

I believe it started out as a simple attempt to parallelize a workload
that sliced the problem too low, instead of slicing it in larger chunks
and have each thread do more work at a time. It did well on 2.6.22 with
almost a 2x speedup, but did worse than the single-treaded testcase on a
2.6.24 kernel.
So yes, it can clearly be handled through explanations and education
and fixen the broken testcase, but I'm still not sure the new behaviour
is desired.
