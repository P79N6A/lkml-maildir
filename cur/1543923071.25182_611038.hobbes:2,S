Yes, well said.

Yes - that's what I'm intending to do.

I do intend to implement it as you suggest.  See the lib/bitmap.c
routines bitmap_remap() and bitmap_bitremap(), and the nodemask
wrappers for these, nodes_remap() and node_remap().  They will
define the cycling, or I sometimes call it folding.
I would have tended to make this folding a defined part of the API,
though I will grant that the possibility of being lazy and forgetting
to document it seems attractive (less to document ;).

Nah - I wouldn't put it that way.  It's no mistake or abuse.  It's just
one more example of a kernel making too few resources look sufficient
by sharing, multiplexing and virtualizing them.  That's what kernels do.
