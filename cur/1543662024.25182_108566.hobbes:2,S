What messages have they seen in the system log? Some messages should be
after this kind of error. It is difficult to see where the problem is
without any details. There have not been any significant changes in EOM
handling in st between the 2.4 kernels.

Don't know. EOM handling has worked with my test system (HP DDS drives
connected to a SYM53c896) with both 2.4 and 2.5 kernels. I just reran the
eom tests with 2.4.20 and 2.5.60 without problems.
