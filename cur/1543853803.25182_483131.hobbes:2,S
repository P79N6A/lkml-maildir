But then you can't dynamically determine which MSRs are available.
And no, reading/setting MSRs isn't performance critical for the current 
use cases.

Heh.  That was the original implementation by Uri.  I felt that was 
wrong because _IOW() encodes the size in the ioctl number, bit the 
actual size is different.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
