I suggest a slightly (not a lot) more sophisticated stopwatch ...
Use -mm kernels, that's where the latest vm stuff is
http://www.zipworld.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.40/2.5.40-mm2/
and Andrew is normally wonderfully responsive to clear data from 
profiles (see oprofile below)
Then either use strace with the time option on it (-t?), or:
1. use oprofile (grab from akpm's site:
http://www.zipworld.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.40/2.5.40-mm2/experimental/
), and boot with idle=poll
2. in one window type the command to stop the oprofile stuff, but
don't press return (something like "op_stop > /dev/linux")
3. In another window do:
rm -rf /var/lib/oprofile
op_start --vmlinux=/boot/vmlinux --map-file=/boot/System.map --ctr0-event=CPU_CLK_UNHALTED --ctr0-count=300000 > /dev/null
my_application
4. When your app finishes starting, hit return in that first window.
5. oprofpp -dl -i /boot/vmlinux  > data_dumpy_place.
Examine output.
Or something along those lines. Not very sophisticated, but that's
what I'd do I guess (what does that say? ;-))
M.
PS. Actually the combination of an strace and profile might be most
meaningful (though you might want to do them seperately ... make
sure the cache is either cold or warm both times, not one of each).
