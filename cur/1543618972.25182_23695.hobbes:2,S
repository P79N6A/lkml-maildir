Please correct my attempt at clarifying this:
The COW markings are done at the next higher level of hierarchy above
the pte's themselves, and so experience the radix tree branch factor
reduction in the amount of work done at fork-time in comparison to a
full pagetable copy on fork.

It is an overall throughput loss in the cases where the majority of the
page table entries are in fact referenced by the child, and this is
more than acceptable because it is more incremental, reference-all is
an uncommon case, and once all the page table entries are referenced,
there are no longer any penalties. Defeating this scheme would truly
require a contrived application, and penalizes only that application.
Cheers,
Bill
