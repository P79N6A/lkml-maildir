Only problem I see here is 2 fold:
the sb module is for SoundBlaster ISA cards.. And you should really
compile support for the ES1371, not teh 1370., as the 1371 is a closer
match to the PCI128 (1371 is the SB PCI64v)
The settings in conf.modules look like ISA settings. IRQ 11 sounds right
for one of the settings. Others, who knows. I'm not sure what the I/O and
DMA settings should be for a PCI sound card.
I can guess at DMA 5 and 1, but as to I/O base? Who knows. 220 may work.
