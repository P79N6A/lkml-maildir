Is this with or without the patch I recently posted to linux-kernel?
If so, please use the patch at 
http://lars.marowsky-bree.de/dl/md-mp
 instead,
which is slightly newer and fixes one important (affecting raid0 use) and two
minor issues. Please be aware that you are beta-testing code for the time
being ;-) (Which is highly appreciated!)

So far this sounds OK. (Even though the updated md-mp patch will _never_ fail
the last path but instead return the error to the layer upwards; this protects
against certain scenarios in 2.4 where a device error can't be distinguished
from a failed path and we don't want that to lead to an inaccessible device)

That's not OK, obviously ;-)
I will try to reproduce this on Monday. As I don't have the hardware, but
instead use a loop device (which I can make fail on demand), if I can't
reproduce it, it might in fact be the FC driver which gets stuck somehow.

Uhm, essentially, you should never get stuck in uninterruptible sleep. All
errors should "eventually" time out.
Please compile the kernel with magic-sysrq enabled and check where the
processes are stuck using magic-sysrq t. It might help if you piped the
results through ksymoops.
Sincerely,
