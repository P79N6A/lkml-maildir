Shouldn't be any worse than it already is.

Does anyone remember why we started doing this in the first place?  I'm sure 
there are some tools that expect a process tree, rather than a forest, and 
making it a forest could make them unhappy.
The support angel on my shoulder says we should just put all the kernel threads 
under a kthread subtree to shorten init's child list and minimize impact.  The 
hacker devil on my other shoulder says that with usermode helpers, containers, 
etc. it's about time we treat it as a tree, and any tools that have a problem 
with that need to be fixed.
