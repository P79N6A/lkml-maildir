The difficulty is that somewhere near 2.3.22 or before, my APIC was blown
away by the new SMP code............gurr......I finally got the "noapic"
calls to at least both processors, but it is not better than 2.0.X smp
with XT-PIC interrupts.........
The troublesome point is that both my SMP P5 and SMP Celery are fine, but
the trusty Dual Socket 8 PPro is lame........regardless of the broken MP
table with the detached timer on CPU 1.
This locks up just before the device probing begins........
