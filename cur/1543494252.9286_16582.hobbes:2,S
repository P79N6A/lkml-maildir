It usually means problems if a configured interface for which probably
routes have been set does not work. If you want to pull the cable, you
should "ifconfig eth0 down" first.

If a transmission doesn't complete in time there might be two causes:
Either it is a cable problem or the irq that happens after the transmit is
complete didn't happen. If the cable is fixed properly this indicates a
serious problem with your card. If not, you can ignore that, I believe,
but the same goes for that card as for eth0.
