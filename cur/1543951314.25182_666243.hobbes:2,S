expecting the hw to never fail is unreasonable - it will. it's just a
question what happens when (not if) it fails.
and it's not about the backing store being inconsistent during normal
operation - it's about what you are left with after an unclean shutdown.
With your scheme the only time you can trust the on-disk data is when
the device is off; when it fails for some reason (batteries do fail,
kernel bugs do happen, DOS, overheating etc etc) you can no longer
trust any of the data, and no - fsck doesn't help when you have a mix
of old data overwritten by new stuff in basically random order. i can't
see any scenario when it would make sense to trust the corrupted on-disk
fs instead of restoring from backup (or regenerating). So is it just
about avoiding repopulating the fs in the (likely) case of normal,
clean shutdown? This could be a reasonable application of ramback (OTOH
how often will this (shutdown) happen in practice...). IOW you get
a ramdisk-based (ie fast) device that is capable of surviving power loss,
but that's about it.
Now, if you add snapshots to the backing store it suddenly becomes much
more interesting -- you no longer need to put so much trust in all the
hw. Should the device fail for whatever reason then you just rollback to
the last good snapshot upon restart. No corrupted fs, no fsck; you lose
some newly written data (that you couldn't recover w/o a snapshot anyway),
but can trust the rest of it (assuming you trust the fs and storage hw,
but that's no different then w/o ramback).
