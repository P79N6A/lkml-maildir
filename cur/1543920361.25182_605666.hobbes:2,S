Why can't you just add a helper function to sched.c:
	void set_hotcpus_allowed(struct task_struct *task,
				 cpumask_t cpumask)
	{
		mutex_lock(&sched_hotcpu_mutex);
		set_cpus_allowed(task, cpumask);
		mutex_unlock(&sched_hotcpu_mutex);
	}
And then change each task's cpus_allowed via that function instead of 
set_cpus_allowed() directly?
You don't need to worry about making the task->cpuset->cpus_allowed 
assignment a critical section because common_cpu_mem_hotplug_unplug() will 
remove any hot-unplugged cpus from each cpuset's cpus_allowed in the 
hierarchy.
Your loop will still need to be reworked so that cgroup_iter_{start,end}() 
are not reinvoked unnecessarily and you rely only on cgroup_iter_next() 
returning NULL to determine when you've gone through the entire list.  
There's no need to go back and check the cpus_allowed of tasks you've 
already called set_cpus_allowed() on either directly or indirectly via my 
helper function above.
