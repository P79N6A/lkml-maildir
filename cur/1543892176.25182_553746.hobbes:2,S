No, I don't think the problem's gone with the PM timer - it is just much less
likely. Since you depend on the TSC (which must generally be assumed be
unsyncronized across CPUs) and on the error correction factor (which shows
non-zero values every few seconds), getting the interpolated times on two
CPUs out of sync is still possible, and given the way the time keeping code
works even being off by just a single nanosecond may be fatal.
