Why don't we just leave it disabled in the regular kernel, and force users
to hack up the source themselves to keep the PSN enabled.  That way, a
network admin can use his own custom kernel on his machines (eg. for
identifying machines with no ethernet), but software vendors can't force
the PSN upon us because it's not supported on most dummies' computers. 
Or enable it and only use free software, but that's a whole different issue.
