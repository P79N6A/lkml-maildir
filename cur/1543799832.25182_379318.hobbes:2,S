The moment you disconnect AC, it C4 automagically appears.  When you
reconnect to the AC mains, the C4 state disappears again, at least
from the listing displayed by /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power.  So the
first issue you brought up isn't a problem.
The fact that it could change the benchmarks results depending on
whether or you're running on battery or not is unfortunate, but in the
real world does it matter?   
More of an issue is that there are times when the laptop might think
that it's running of the AC mains, but in fact the owner may have
connected an external battery, and might _want_ the system to be as
frugal as possible with the power.

Yep.  As I said, at least on my laptop, this is what
/proc/acpi/processor/CPU/power looks like when I am running on the AC
mains:
active state:            C2
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     e7d24db4
states:
    C1:                  type[C1] promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[001] usage[00000010] time[00000000000000000000]
   *C2:                  type[C2] promotion[C3] demotion[C1] latency[001] usage[00084296] time[00000000000306642441]
    C3:                  type[C3] promotion[--] demotion[C2] latency[085] usage[00000000] time[00000000000000000000]
... and this is what it looks like when I am on battery:
active state:            C2
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     6ef5bbbd
states:
    C1:                  type[C1] promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[001] usage[00000010] time[00000000000000000000]
   *C2:                  type[C2] promotion[C3] demotion[C1] latency[001] usage[00001162] time[00000000000004425803]
    C3:                  type[C3] promotion[C4] demotion[C2] latency[085] usage[00000000] time[00000000000000000000]
    C4:                  type[C3] promotion[--] demotion[C3] latency[185] usage[00000000] time[00000000000000000000]
Whether I boot from AC power battery seems to be immaterial; what
seems to matter is whether or not the laptop is running on battery at
the moment that /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power is sampled.
