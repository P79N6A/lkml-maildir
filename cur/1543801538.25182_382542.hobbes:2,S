Given the original meaning of these "Signed-off-by" lines (certifying
that the added code belongs to the sender), it certainly makes sense.
However, we tend to now use these lines for a second meaning, which is
tracing all approvers of the patch from the author to the committer.
For that second meaning, signing reverts may make sense.

Well, oldconfig is affected by the alignment bug as well. Try deleting
the lines of a few drivers depending on NET_PCI and placed after CS89x0
in .config (e.g. CONFIG_DGRS) and run "make oldconfig", you'll see it.
Aside from the alignment bug, what I really need to know is if the new
dependency expression I came up with it OK:
  NET_PCI && (ISA || ARCH_IXDP2X01 || ARCH_PNX0105)
If it is, then I guess that there is no point discussing any further
and the patch can be applied.
Thanks,
