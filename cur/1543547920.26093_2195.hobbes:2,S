Well, first the "timeout" call will return immediately.  Next, when the
time out actually happens, if the task is not TASK_RUNNING (i.e. it is
waiting for some other thing) it will wake_up.  So the sleep is lost and
it is possible to have a false wake up (could even wake up a zombie). 
If the actual timeout happens while the task is TASK_RUNNING it is
ignored.
