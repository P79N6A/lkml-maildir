Unless the v3 and v4 structs have the same layout (and they don't,
although I may have developed a sudden cross-eydness [1]), the code can't
possibly work for all ncpmounts. It may be unused on some arch's because
they don't need 32->64 translation.
I suggest you put it on your list but below the ascii-fication, since that
is another (better?) solution to the same problem.
