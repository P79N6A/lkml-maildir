Alan,
thanks for the quick reply. The good news: 2.4.18pre3-ac2 works.
I now get the message
"i2o/iop0 reset rejected, trying to clear"
(this message does not appear when initialization by the BIOS was 
aborted manually at boot time.)
Whatever the problem is, the kernel seems to be able to handle the exception now.
Thanks again,
Sebastian
