	I didn't look for what it was at the SMTP level while
	incoming, but RFC 821 (SMTP) is the transport method, and
	VGER won't accept unqualified ( + a few more rules )
	What you are saying is that RFC 822 level (visible headers)
	should be controlled for something ?
	I have a surprise for you, RFC 822 data carries only incidental
	resemblance with the message content and destination.
	Like now, you (dwmw2) get this message twice: once from me
	which means the "From:" might even carry some resemblance
	to the sender (yes, resemblance, it isn't my login-id, just
	my email address), the second one comes via the list, and
	the Majordomo won't change the From: to be
		linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
	which is the real sender in that case...
	... and this is completely off topic ...
