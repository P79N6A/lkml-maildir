No, almost all non-overlapping users already just use "memcpy()". 
So most of the kernel uses of "memmove()" are likely overlapping - and 
just optimizing the non-overlap case probably doesn't help a lot.
That's why you optimize the overlapping case in one direction. We really 
should do the other case right too.
