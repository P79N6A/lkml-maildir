Two questions:
1) related to this patch: Do you want me to generate a patch that
asserts only notifier calls ?
2) Unrelated to this patch: If the _code_ section is never reallocated
or reused, what is the purpose of putting _code_ in the init section ?
Only to make sure that the init calls are called in order ?
Thanks
