True - sorry.  I kinda hijacked your thread.  I had fork_connector
associated in my mind with process accounting, so made the leap from
analyzing the fork_connector mechanism on its own merit, to analyzing
whether it was useful for collecting the new process accounting
information that was needed from forks.
In my own defense, I don't see where the motivations for fork_connector
are spelled out in the presentation to this patch, and it seems that
the other potential uses of it are less well explored at this point.
So I think my leap was a small one ;).
