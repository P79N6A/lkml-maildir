quotacheck would be sanest :) But the struct super_block->remount is 
probably the best idea in kernel space.

Yeah right, XFS was designed for large systems rather than for just 
my 262188 files. (The latter of which completes in an "adequate" time of 
a few secs.)

Certainly not, but XFS has the advange of bulkstat for quota scanning.
`quotacheck` on vfsv0 quota databases always takes longer IMO.

Noted.
