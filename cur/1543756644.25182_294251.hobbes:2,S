Hi,
I've been writing a device driver for a piece of hardware that we recently found the pci bridge has an issue on software reset (kernel 2.6.8.1, hardware reset is fine).  The bridge appears to corrupt the subvendor/device ids on next boot.  We have found a software work around in that I can write to the bridge on module exit and it will always detect correctly next boot (through module_exit when rmmod'd).
However on shutting down a machine with the module loaded it never works next time, so is module_exit actually called?
Secondly I searched through some code and on google to determine if I could detect a shutdown notification in the kernel.  I thougt I'd found something using:
static struct pci_driver hsid_driver =
{
    .name     = HSID_NAME,
    .id_table = id_table,
    .probe    = hsid_probe,
    .driver   =
    {
        .shutdown = hsid_shutdown,
    },
};
However that also appears not to work.  I wondered what the correct solution was for detecting system shutdown in the kernel even if the application using the device has locked up on un-interruptible sleep, so I may try to clean the hardware up a little.
Thankyou for any assistance,
Simon
