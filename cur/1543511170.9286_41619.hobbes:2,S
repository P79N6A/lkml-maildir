You seem to be handling plain Pentium as K6. Is this right? I'd assume that
if gcc has -march=pentium and -march=k6 they are handled differently...
Anyway, all this is a royal mess: Way too many slightly different processor
options. Is there a real performance improvement here, so this really buys
something?
