 I'll swap the sections in the future then. ;-)  Frankly I was not sure 
whether the changelog was happy about being fed with lengthy explanations 
and it has not spoken out.
 I have to admit this is a habit carried over from the FSF-style ChangeLog 
-- where the enforced rule is actually *not* to provide any explanation 
for why changes are done and only describe what has been modified (with 
any discussion around archived in the respective mailing list).

 Thank you and sorry for the extra work I caused you -- I shall keep your 
suggestion in mind in the future.
