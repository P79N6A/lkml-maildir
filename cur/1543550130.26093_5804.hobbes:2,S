Hi,
Our company is going to purchase some hardware to run Linux
workstations.
We're looking forward into getting i815e based ASUS motherboards,
and I will be really glad if you could help me figure out the following
hardware support questions I couldn't figure myself.
I've searched the LKML archive and Intel and few other sites,
but didn't find enough straightforward answers concerning
the more/less complete Linux support of ASUS CUSL2-M (i815e)
motherboard,
(
http://www.asus.com.tw/products/motherboard/pentiumpro/cusl2-m/spec.html
)
Here are the things:
Is the 82801BA Contoller Hub (ICH2) supported (would I get ATA-100
working)?
Searching through drivers/pci/pci.ids (test9-pre7),
I found 82801AB (ICH0?) only.
Is  AD1881A (AC'97 audio) codec  supported?
There's also onboard  3C905C NIC ASIC,
would that work with 3C905 driver?
Thanks a lot,
Art.
