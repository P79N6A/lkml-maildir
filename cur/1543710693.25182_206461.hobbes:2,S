hm. Since your .config boots on akpm's box, this is some BIOS dependency
creating an early-boot problem i fear. Debugging such bugs is hard. One 
way would be via the PC speaker:
	movb $0x3,%al; outb %al,$0x61
this will cause a continuous beep on a typical PC - it works in 16-bit
code too, doesnt have any memory-model assumptions, etc.
the first place to put this would be startup_32 - do we get to this
point at all? (check CONFIG_4G first, to make sure the beep triggers.) 
If it beeps, then move it down until you find the place that crashes.
