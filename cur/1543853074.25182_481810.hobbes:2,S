Sorry about chiming in so late. When I tried to use this with neverball,
ams_info.xcalib - x (and similar for the others) was more useful because
of the way things are oriented. If I tilt my powerbook to the left then
with this original code the mouse cursor moves to the right which is
contrary to what neverball expects.
Not sure if we want to change this or not, it sort of boils down to a
userspace issue and we could just patch neverball to have a direction
inversion :)
