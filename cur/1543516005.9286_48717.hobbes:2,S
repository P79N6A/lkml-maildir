The whole idea behind *.a is to be able to remove dead objects, which is
totally opposite of --whole-archive.
The problem lies in that drivers which use module_init() can be valid,
linkable objects, with no external references at all.  There needs to be
some way to tell the linker to include all objects which have
module_init() in them.
