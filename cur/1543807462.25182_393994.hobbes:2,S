wrong. v2 already is a statement that the author doesn't have patents on
the code, or alternatively that the author has granted you the patent
rights and will not sue you for using the code. it's also a statement
that the author doesn't have patent licenses from 3rd parties that
he/she cannot sublicense.
v3 clarifies and expands on this most likely, but v2 already offers
basic patent trap protection.
