Reality?
I'm one of the 42 remaining people with a terminal. My VT510
mostly sits unplugged due to heat, and it's taking up space.
The RS-232 port is legacy hardware anyway, due for removal.
My VT510 doesn't speak USB.
Morse doesn't do "<" and other common characters. For those
who know it, morse is useful. For well over 99% of the users,
morse is gibberish anyway.
There's no "set up a microphone and decoder" problem.
Most people have a tape recorder. Use that, then play
back into the PC's sound card after you reboot. Post the
sound file on a web site.
Sure, morse is cute and FSK isn't. FSK is useful. Morse is
useful too, for different reasons. One could output in both
formats, alternating between them until reboot.
