The kernel gets that sort of thing wrong anyway, and always has, because
it uses memcpy()-style copying and not memmove()-style.
I can't imagine what sort of application you're envisaging here.  The
problem was only ever observed from userspace by an artificial stress-test
thing.

Only because ->commit_write() went and incorrectly marked parts of the page
as up-to-date.
Zeroing out the fag end of the copy_from_user() on fault is actually incorrect. 
What we _should_ do is to bring those uncopyable, non-uptodate parts of the
page uptodate rather than zeroing them.  ->readpage() does that.
So...  what happens if we do
	lock_page()
	prepare_write()
	if (copy_from_user_atomic()) {
		readpage()
		wait_on_page()
		lock_page()
	}
	commit_write()
	unlock_page()
- If the page has no buffers then it is either fully uptodate or fully
  not uptodate.  In the former case, don't call readpage at all.  In the
  latter case, readpage() is the correct thing to do.
- If the page had buffers, then readpage() won't touch the uptodate ones
  and will bring the non-uptodate ones up to date from disk.
  Some of the data which we copied from userspace may get overwritten
  from backing store, but that's OK.
seems crazy, but it's close.  We do have the minor problem that readpage
went and unlocked the page so we need to relock it.  I bet there are holes
in there.
Idea #42: after we've locked the pagecache page, do an atomic get_user()
against the source page(s) before attempting the copy_from_user().  If that
faults, don't run prepare_write or anything else: drop the page lock and
try again.
Because
- If the get_user() faults, it might be because the page we're copying
  from and to is the same page, and someone went and unmapped it: deadlock.
- If the get_user() doesn't fault, and if we're copying from and to the
  same page, we know that we've locked it, so nobody will be able to unmap
  it while we're copying from it.
Close, but no cigar!  This is still vulnerable to Hugh's ab/ba deadlock
scenario.
btw, to fix the writev() performance problem we may need to go off and run
get_user() against up to 1024 separate user pages before locking the
pagecache page, which sounds fairly idiotic.  Are you doing that in the
implemetnations which you've been working on?  I forget...
