Ethan doesn't want that change upstream for 1.x, at least not until
it has been mode widely tested. The 1.x yaboot code base isn't something
I'd call "solid", so... :)

No, different issues, but I expect a 1.8 Mb vmlinux.elf-pmac to work,
though it's possible that the wrapper in linus tree is bogus (I though
I sent him fixes... it's beeing difficult to merge anything in 2.6 at
this point).
For PowerMac in general, you'd rather use my tree, at least until maybe
around 2.6.1, and even then... Especially for such very new machine for
which the proper support is only getting in now.
Ben.
