i'm not sure what the point is. There was no sudden rush of -Os related 
bugs when Fedora switched to it for the kernel, and the 35% code-size 
savings were certainly worth it in terms of icache footprint. Yes, -Os 
is a major change for how the compiler works, and the kernel is a major 
piece of software.
