> That seems strange. What is realserver failing with ?
It isn't so much failing as it hangs.  I don't know if you have used it
or not.  On a startup of the realserver under a 2.2 kernel here is the
output:
*****************************************************************

it then goes on to load libs and stuff.  Under a 2.4 kernel it gets to the
"Testing 1 CPU(s)" Line and just stops there and sits.  I have tried it on
3 different machines and 5 different installs, all with the same results.
