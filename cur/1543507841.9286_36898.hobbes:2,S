I was wondering if it is possible for the kernel configuration "program"
to (based on the options chosen from the last kernel I last configured) to
only ask me the new/unset questions(if any) that need to be answered,
maybe configure -oldscript <script-filename>, you can allready
save your kernel configuration into another file. If you can't is this not
a good idea?
