Does this mean, that containers will need this?  Or that you don't
know yet?

I'm not against per-user rlimits for mounts, but I'd rather do this
later...

fsuid is exclusively used for checking file permissions, which we
don't do here anymore.  So while it could be argued, that mount() _is_
a filesystem operation, it is really a different sort of filesystem
operation than the rest.
OTOH it wouldn't hurt to use fsuid instead of ruid...

That's a flawed logic.  If you want to mount as a specific user, and
you have CAP_SETUID, then just use set*uid() and then mount().
Changing the capability check for mount() would break the userspace
ABI.
