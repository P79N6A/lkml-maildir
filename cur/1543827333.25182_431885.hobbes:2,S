Well, that's the basic idea, but slowly I'm wondering whether anyone has 
really figured out how to do this.
Being able to produce small binaries is part of it, but it somehow also 
has to work together with the rest of system, e.g. how can be configured 
(by the user, distribution, ...) or how can it be extended.
We need to know where we are going, otherwise it's hard to know whether 
we're on the right path.
bye, Roman
