    They're not supposed to.
    There's certainly nothing wrong with writing some all-singing
    all-dancing (just where did that expression come from?) code to deal
    with proprietary ip extensions in the Linux kernel, but ifconfig,
    route, and the rest of the BSD networking suite deal with the
    network configuration that 99% of the network attached machines out
    there have.

     Okay.  Lets try this on one of my FreeBSD servers...
     # ip a a 1.2.3.4/nn brd + dev eth0
     ksh: ip: not found
     Hmm.   How about on an Irix build machine...
     root@mo(/)#  ip a a 1.2.3.4/nn brd + dev eth0
     ksh: ip: not found
     O-kay.  Maybe OSF-1?
     # ip a a 1.2.3.4/nn brd + dev eth0
     ksh: ip: not found
     That's three strikes.   I guess I could telnet to one of my cisco
     routers and try it there, but vi doesn't run on IOS, so what's the
     point?

     Mastodon's admintool allows me to manipulate netmasks via cidr's,
     but it sensibly writes the device configuration out in a script
     that can be used to bring the device up by a combination of
     ifconfig and route.

     And I'm just waiting for the inevitable ``must tweak a magic variable
     before the zero subnet is usable'' patch.

     david parsons \bi/ FreeBSD isn't any better about ifconfig, because it
                    \/        also pastes in routes without a by your leave.
