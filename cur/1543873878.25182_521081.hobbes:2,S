Greetings Con & company;
I built and rebooted to 2.6.20.3-rdsl-0.31 earlier this evening, but 
purposely waited till amanda was well underway to make a report.
The report is that I really really have to work hard to tell that amanda 
is running even though the cpu according to gkrellm is running between 97 
and 99%.
For my loading then, this is as much an improvement over the -ck1 patch as 
it was over the un-patched but same version of the kernel.  FWIW, I'd 
also built a 2.6.20.3-rdsl-0.30 and ran it for a day but it was nearly as 
spastic as no patch.
Did I say I like this yet? :)
Now I'm waiting for 2.6.21-rc4 to make the mirrors & see if tar is still 
broken.  Based on the clues I've been able to find, I bz'd the tar since 
that's a fedora supplied rpm install.  Humm, I just now recalled that I 
have a tarball built tar-1.15.1 on another drive, I was using it when I 
was running FC2, so that might be something else to bisect against, and I 
will, bet on it.
Many thanks Con, this is very nice.  I've only seen one split second when 
the screen was about 2 chars behind my typing.  This is great. :-)
