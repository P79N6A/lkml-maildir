Earlier I had thought this could just be done using a special keyring,
but atm I'm thinking that would be far uglier than just having a
struct pid-like credential proxy in the kernel to pass around in place
of uids.

True.
But in any case I'm happy letting other things like netns and related
sys be completed before prototyping this.
