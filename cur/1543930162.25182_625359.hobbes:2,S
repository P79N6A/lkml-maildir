That would require users to understand all kinds of BTS formats
and to detect the hardware they are running on in order to interpret
the data.
So far, there are two different formats. But one of them is wasting
an entire word of memory per record. I could imagine that this would
change some day.
Other architectures would likely use an entirely different format.
Users who want to support several architectures would benefit from
a common format for this from-to branch information.

I see.
The intention was not to provide exact timestamps, but rather a
relative order of BTS chunks that would allow debuggers to
show which parts were (actually, "might have been" is the best we
can say) executed in parallel, and which parts were definitely 
executed sequentially.
Without a global time, though, this becomes rather meaningless.
Is there some other metric that would allow me to order BTS 
chunks for different threads?

Agreed;-)
Users would benefit if they wanted to support multiple architectures.
They would need to invent such a more general interface; or duplicate 
code, which is never a good thing.
