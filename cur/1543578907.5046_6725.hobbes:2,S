This is exactly the same problem I'm seeing with a Solaris box talking
to my Linux box. It has a similar problem with Linux as well, but does
not manifest as bad against a 2.2 kernel machine. Seems I was chasing
down the wrong path with MSS and MTU strangeness, I tested this with
ethereal as soon as I saw your post.
No help from me, I'm afraid, but I can at least verify that you are not
the only one seeing it.
