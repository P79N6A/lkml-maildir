It does indeed.  ALSA provides the "common" PCI suspend/resume
callbacks, which call the internal suspend/resume callbacks.
It's for handling the power status from the external program, too.
These are defined as SND_PCI_PM_CALLBACKS.  If CONFIG_PM is not set,
it's expanded to empty.  So, typically the code looks like the
following:
static struct pci_driver driver = {
	.name = "Intel ICH",
	.id_table = snd_intel8x0_ids,
	.probe = snd_intel8x0_probe,
	.remove = __devexit_p(snd_intel8x0_remove),
	SND_PCI_PM_CALLBACKS
};
