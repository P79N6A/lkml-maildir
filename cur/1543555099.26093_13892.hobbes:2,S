That guess would be dubious. Its also not IMHO enough to explain the
speed difference. That looks like something is causing far bigger delays
internally.

Providing your driver supports scatter gather you will get large chunks handed
down to the driver. In the scsi world you can control that with the
scsi host template settings. (both the scatter/gather limit and whether you
want the scsi layer to try and merge requests for you)
