i recompiled with DEBUG_BOOTMEM enabled, and it booted fine.  that macro
only turns on a couple printk's, so i suspect i messed up the first
build.  after rebuilding without DEBUG_BOOTMEM again, and booting
sucessfully, i'd say it's working fine on this 32-bit SPARC20
here's the debug output, btw:
Available physical memory:
vailable segment: [66347008,66424831]
available segment: [2396160,2400255]
available segment: [5623808,16777215]
available segment: [17096704,66342911]
