Not everything we have is straight bugfixes :-\

Find the collection of changes we've done to SCSI scanning at
http://www.suse.de/~garloff/linux/scsi-scan/scsi-scanning.html
(currently syncing, might take an hour before the patches are visible)
It contains 
* various blacklist updates
* various new parameters that influence the way SCSI scanning is done
  (one of the areas that generated amazingly many support calls and
   HW vendor requests)
* a refactoring of the code to make it resemble 2.6
* support for REPORT_LUNS (backport from 2.6 as well)
The amount of parameters is larger than in 2.6, you can also instruct
the code not to use REPORT_LUNS at all, you can blacklist devices
for REPORT_LUNS (BLIST_NOREPLUN) and you can tell the code to try
REPORT_LUNS on SCSI-2 devices (if the host adapter reports to support
more than 8 LUNs, so you avoid the usual USB screwups).
I'd certainly appreciate if this is merged into more 2.4 trees and I'll
try to find the time to push some improvements into 2.6. If anybody is
faster, I would not mind either ;-)
Destructive criticism appreciated ;-)
Doug, would you mind to post the BUSY and QUEUE_FULL fixes for review?
