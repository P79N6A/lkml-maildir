Is blk_size[][] supposed to contain the size in KB or blocks?
I'm confused because it looks to me as though it's still in KB,
but people say that devices can be up to 8 or 16TB, and there's
not enough room for that within a signed int containing KB
(2^31 * 2^10 = 2^41 = 2TB).
Either the rumour is true and it's in blocks, or the rumour
is false and it's in KB.
Clue, please!
Peter
