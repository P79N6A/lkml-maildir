I suppose that's not unreasonable to put in mm/memory.c, although
it's not really considered a problem to do this kind of stuff in
a low level arch file...
You have no kernel virtual mapping for the source data?
Should it be __init?
Care to add a line of documentation if you keep it in mm/memory.c?
Thanks,
Nick
