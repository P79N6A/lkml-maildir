ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/UM*-RC12-rc4.  The first one is your skas0
rediffed to -rc4, the rest - fixes (matching the bug list upthread; the
last two are actually older than the rest, missed them in the original list
of bugs; one is obvious missing include, another is dereferencing userland
pointer instead of dealing with copied value + missing chunk in amd64/tt
sc_copy_...).
