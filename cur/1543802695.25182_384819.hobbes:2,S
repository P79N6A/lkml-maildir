I agree the omap MMC driver should be cleaned-up and finally merged.
Anderson, since you are already patching it, do you want to take care of
cleaning it up a bit and posting it here?
There are some mmc core hacks there for buggy cards that might worth
testing on other platforms too. (It could also be that they are
only needed on omap).
As far as I remember for omap we've had to do hacks for cards that claim
to be ready before the data is transferred, and also hacks for cards
that never set the ready bit...
