Hi guys!!!
        This is my first mail to ts list and i'm eagerly awaiting a
reply. I was goin thru the printk source and found out that pritk was
calling the write method of struct console 's present on a list
pointed to by console_drivers. So I thot of adding my own console
driver like this....
 
#define MODULE
#define __KERNEL__
#include<linux/module.h>
#include<linux/kernel.h>
#include<linux/console.h>
#include<linux/sched.h>
 
void my_write(struct console *co,const char *buf,unsigned count)
{
  struct tty_struct *my_tty;
  my_tty = current->tty;
  if(my_tty != NULL)
  {
    ((my_tty->driver).write)(my_tty,0,buf,strlen(buf));
  }
}
 
struct console my_console = {
name:"MYCON",
write:my_write,
flags:CON_ENABLED,
index:-1,
};
 
int init_module()
{
  register_console(&my_console);
  return 0;
}
 
void cleanup_module()
{
}
 
When I insmoded the module (in run level 3) it worked fine. While it
was still inserted i typed 'startx' and when i pressed 'Enter' ,the
machine instantly rebooted!!! I tried this again and it happened. With
MYCON registered ,if I issue the startx command ,the machine reboots.
Also if MYCON is registered and I shutdown using 'init 0' again the reboot 
happens.Can anyone explain??
 
bye
