In fact they *must* provide some implementation of those calls,
and several platforms do exactly that.  (Since the legacy GPIO
code didn't use such primitives ... nothing to wrap.)

Thing is, issuing those calls is not currently mandatory ... so
requiring use of them would be an incompatible API change, which
would require auditing (and fixing, and testing) much platform code.

In fact, possibly before IRQs get set up ... some platforms start
using GPIOs very early in system setup.
