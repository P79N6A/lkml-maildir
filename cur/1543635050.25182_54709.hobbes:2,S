Well, since we're talking about root:
 - If you had saved the old root before chroot()ing, use that one.
 - If you have your whole disk exported via NFS, the prisoner process 
   could use nfs to read files outside the jail
 - If you have access to a /dev directory, use /dev/sd?? to do the disc
   access
 - If not, use mknod("dideldei", 600, {68,1}); open("dideldei", O_SYNC);
   and do as you like.
However, if you aren't running anything you find as root, it's relatively 
secure.
