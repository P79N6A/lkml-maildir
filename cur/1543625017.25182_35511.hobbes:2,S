There is not a single right answer because it's based on your work load.
I would set it to 2x or 3x the ammount of swap you currently have *in use* during
normal operation.
For smaller ammounts of ram (measured in the hundreds) I'd just make it
equal to how much ram you have.  With more ram, use the above suggestion.
