ack, to me too ;-)
I'll send this privately to all of you except lkml because it's somewhat huge.
Anyway, here some info about it:
Patch information:
------------------
- Update XFree DRM code to recent code from 2.4.22-rc2-ac3
- DRI now works with XFree v4.3.0
- ATI IGP chipset support added incl. pci ids, AGP support
- Initial VIA CLE266 and S3 Savage DRM modules merges from VIA
   (These are marked up with some warnings and need a chunk of clean up work)
- enabled 3dlabs GMX 2000 config option
All compiles cleanly, at least r128 (ati rage 128) works perfectly with XFree 
v4.3.0. I have such a card :)
ciao, Marc
