Yes, it's a valid concern.
Paul will correct me if this is wrong...  As I understand it, the code 
which responds to a synchronize_sched() call (that is, the code which runs 
on other CPUs) does lots of stuff, involving context changes and 
who-knows-what else.  There are lots of memory barriers in there, buried 
in the middle, along with plenty of other memory reads and writes.
In outline, the reader's CPU responds to synchronize_sched() something 
like this:
	At the next safe time (context switch):
		mb();
		Tell the writer's CPU that the preempt count on
			the reader's CPU is 0
Since that "tell the writer's CPU" step won't complete until after the 
mb() has forced all preceding memory operations to complete, we are safe.
So perhaps the documentation for synchronize_sched() and synchronize_rcu()  
should say that when the call returns, all CPUs (including the caller's)
will have executed a memory barrier and so will have completed all memory
operations that started before the synchronize_xxx() call was issued.
