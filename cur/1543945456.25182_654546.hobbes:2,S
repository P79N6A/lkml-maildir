If you don't see an ethical problem in removing a working driver which 
is not taking support resources, in order to force people to test and 
debug a driver they don't now and never would need, so that it might in 
time offer them the same functionality those users already had... then I 
can never make you see why technological extortion is evil. People have 
always moved to new drivers without pushing because they were *better*, 
guess that model is dead.
