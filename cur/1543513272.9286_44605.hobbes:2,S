Subject: 2.3.22 dies with unix sockets as module

2.3.20 (UP) works with unix sockets compiled as a module.  
2.3.22 (UP) fails, it  mounts root, frees unused kernel memory,
boots INIT 2.77 and then nothing more happens usually.  One attempt
gave me a "killing sh" message.  SysRq may be used for sync, umount &
reboot.
2.3.22 UP came up fine once I changed it to compiled-in unix sockets.
The 2.3.22 kernels above was compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3  
A 2.3.22 kernel compiled with gcc 2.95.2 and modular sockets got
further into the startup scripts before it too died.
