Hello Philipp,

So you're using the analog tuner of the card to watch analog cable tv and 
want to decode teletext from the vbi, right? 
Can you tell me the last kernel version that worked for you?

739         fmt = format_by_fourcc(dev,fh->video_fmt.pixelformat);
740         /* we need to have a valid format set here */
741         BUG_ON(NULL == fmt); 
This sanity check is failing. Apparently the software managed
to select a pixelformat that cannot be translated to a "saa7146 format". 
Puh, I wrote this long ago. ;-) IIRC this should not be possible (ie. the 
driver should reject the unknown pixelformat in the configuring stage). 
Did you update the alevt package? Perhaps it's now doing this differently 
and it would fail with older kernels as well, which have worked before. 
We will probably have to debug this on a very low level. 
Regards
Michael.
