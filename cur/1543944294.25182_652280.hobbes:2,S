I may be a bit defensive here, but I hope that all of the recent
kobject/kset/driver core changes have been done with the thought of
"what are we doing wrong".
For the kset rework, we went back and looked at how people were trying
to use this code, realized that it was way too complex, and reworked it
all, making both the implementation simpler, the kernel usage model
simpler, and documented the whole thing so that everyone knows exactly
what is now going on.
To quote the original developer of that code when hearing of the
rewrite, "thank you for doing it, I have no idea what I was thinking
when I wrote that code originally."  The end result caused more code to
be removed from the kernel than was added, always a nice thing.
The rework went through many iteratations, reviews, rebases, and touched
many portions of the kernel.  In the end, there was only 1 merge issue,
in a new IB driver, and Roland and I handled that after Andrew pointed
out.  That kind of dependency was what I was trying to warn the -next
maintainers about.

No, I understand the issues here, and am working hard to resolve them.
Now that the kobject underlying layer looks very good, I'm moving a bit
higher up, into the driver core to be able to handle a long-standing
requirement by a lot of hardware vendor and driver authors.  And yes,
that is going to cause a few problems in a few places in the
bus-specific logic (the PCI core looks to be the biggest issue, as it
does some nasty things with some internal device lists), but for the
rest of the kernel, and individual driver authors, it will not be an
issue at all.
But I understand your main point here, a lot of time I might come across
as wanting to constantly change this chunk of code, but I'm only doing
it because it's necessary.  I'd much rather be off just writing new
drivers, and not having to touch this stuff at all.
If people see changes in which they think I and Kay are unnecessarily
causing churn, please call us out on it, I have no problem with that.

A lot of time that already happens today, between the different
subsystem maintainers.  We routinely pass PCI and driver core changes
through the network and scsi and ata trees in order to handle merge
issues properly.  This already happened in a few places in the
2.6.25-rc1 merge cycle.
But so far we have been doing this on a per-patch level, not really on a
git-tree level.  Maybe we might want to re-think this if needed.

I'll do this next time I do kobject/driver core changes and see how it
works out.
