AFAIK bouncing means a plain, physical copy.
Either the HCDs can do 64bit DMA or they can't.
Do you really expect there to be a significant number of 32bit machines
whose HCD can do 64bit DMA ?
If not, it's IMHO not worth doing it as you'd have either two kinds of
urbs or overhead in the common case.
On 64Bit machines we might have to deal with HCDs who can do 32Bit DMA
only. Perhaps there should be a gfp field in the usb_device struct
to export knowledge about the memory the HCD can cope with.

And there's the overhead of sleeping and waking a kernel thread. Larger io
requests might help, but I am not sure.
