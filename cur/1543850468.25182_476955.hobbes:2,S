I have reproduced the same issue on the another node:
ASUSTeK P5GD1-VM,
Intel 915G chipset,
ICH6 IDE controller,
IDE dvdrom: SONY DVD-ROM DDU1615 (hda),
sata disk: WDC WD1600JS-00M
when I switch IDE controller to the native mode, I see "Disabling IRQ" message,
then kernel generates an oops in create_empty_buffers(), like I've reported earlier.
Could somebody please help me to troubleshoot this issue? I've seen this issue
on the customer nodes and would like to know how I can work-around this issue
without any changes inside motherboard BIOS.
thank you,
