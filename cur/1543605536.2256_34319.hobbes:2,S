We have the AGP, DRM and framebuffer drivers in the kernel anyway. It would 
make sense to do all the autodetection in kernelspace, and let the info be 
available to the X-server. I would love to kill all the hardware specific 
stuff in /etc/XF86Config, especially the keyboard and mouse stuff that 
belongs in or near the kernel.
