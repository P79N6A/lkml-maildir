Right now, I'm using just a single 512MB module, but it is single-sided
(I guess that by double-sided you guys mean that it has chips on both
sides of the module, right?). The only double-sided module that I have
here is the 256MB module.
OTOH, with just one 512MB everything *seems* to be working fine, but,
honestly, I'm not sure.

Hummm, nice to see that you have also experienced this. With 256 + 128,
I had to use PC100 to have it work stably.

I'd obviously prefer to have everything working at PC133 speed, but
wouldn't mind running at PC100 speed if I could use everything, since I
sometimes need to use some large programs (for some dynamic programming
problems).
Thanks for sharing your experiences,
