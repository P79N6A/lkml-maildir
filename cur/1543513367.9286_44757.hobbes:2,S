Even further correction (fix within minutes as promised :) it was my bug:
        error = register_filesystem(&bfs_fs_type);
        if (error)
                return error;
        fs = get_fs();
        set_fs(get_ds());
        bfs_fsindex = sysfs(1, (unsigned long)"bfs", 0);
        set_fs(fs);
        if (bfs_index < 0) {
                unregister_filesystem(&bfs_fs_type);
                return -EINVAL;
        }
        return 0;
Regards,
Tigran.
