Sorry for the long delay, I've been busy with other stuff.
Yes, you are correct, this kind of change is necessary in order to get
root_plug working again.
I only have one very tiny, cosmetic, problem with the patch:

Please do not add "changelog" type comments to files that do not already
have changelogs in them.  They are unmaintainable within the kernel and
do nothing to help anyone out.
Rely on the change history that we now have due to the use of bitkeeper,
which shows your name associated with a specific changeset.
If you take these lines out, I have no problem with the patch.
thanks,
