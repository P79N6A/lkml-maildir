My Intel manual says it 486+:
``
XADD-Exchange and Add
[...]
Intel Architecture Compatibility
Intel Architecture processors earlier than the Intel486TM processor do not recognize this instruc-
tion. If this instruction is used, you should provide an equivalent code sequence that runs on
earlier processors.
''
I guess 386 could live with an exception handler that emulates it.
(BTW an generic exception handler for CMPXCHG would also be very useful
for glibc -- currently it has special checking code for 386 in its mutexes) 
The 386 are so slow that nobody would probably notice a bit more slowness
by a few exceptions.
