Well, Kevin Coffman has reviewed it and tested it against his NFS keys patches.

For this warning:
ERROR: need space after that ',' (ctx:WxV)
#627: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:28:
+#define kenter(FMT, ...) no_printk("==> %s("FMT")\n",__FUNCTION__ ,##__VA_ARGS__)
                                                                   ^
This is with good reason.  Some versions of cpp get the ## resolution "wrong"
if __VA_ARGS__ is empty (ie: there are no arguments to the macro that
correspond to the "...").  This can be worked around by abutting the "," the
"##" and the "__VA_ARGS__" with no spaces, and inserting a space before the
comma.
If I remember correctly, the comma won't be removed if it doesn't abut the
##__VA_ARGS__, and the comma and everthing that abuts it on its LHS can be
removed if there's also no space.  Without the "##", the comma isn't removed.
Consider the result of doing x("a"); where x(y, ...) is #defined to each of the
folowing:
	DEFINITION			RESULT
	===============================	=======================
	printk(y, __VA_ARGS__)		print(y, );
	printk(y ,__VA_ARGS__)		print(y ,);
	printk(y,##__VA_ARGS__)		print();
	printk(y, ##__VA_ARGS__)	print(y, );
	printk(y ,##__VA_ARGS__)	print(y );

I'll change the comment to:
	/* make sure no one's trying to change or use the key when we mark it
	 * - we tell lockdep that we might nest because we might be revoking an
	 *   authorisation key whilst holding the sem on a key we've just
	 *   instantiated
	 */

I could, but that potentially wastes time in two ways: firstly, there can be an
error before we've finished setting up, and that can lead to us having wasted
the time spent making the copy; and secondly, the call to kstrdup itself wastes
a bit of time because of the extra call made.
On the other hand, the code might end up a bit shorter, and isn't particularly
fast path anyway.

Fixed.

Kevin Coffman and Trond for the NFS stuff, both of whom are CC'd.
