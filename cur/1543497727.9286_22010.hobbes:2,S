Hello all,
In compiling 2.2.9 for an AlphaStatuon 200 (4/166), compilation of
arch/alpha/lib/stx*.S fails due to the #include <alpha/regdef.h>
referencing a non-existent file.  Please note that I'm cross compiling on
an x86 linux box.  If someone happens to have a copy of this file, or
patch available, please drop me a note.  Thanks.
