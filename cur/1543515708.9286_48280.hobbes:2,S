Rock solid scheduling isnt a property of a corrupt disk.

The problematic stuff is almost all ISA. That makes life hard. With PCI we
can probe and pick up problem stuff (RZ1000 etc)  The VIA VP1/VP2 are others
with interesting issues (our DMA autotune code fails on them)

IDE controller issue.

Correct.

Distributions have to work with as much hardware as possible. It's more a case
of ensuring that the car delivered goes and the wheels don't fall off than
the hand tuning it. The latter is _very_ hard.
