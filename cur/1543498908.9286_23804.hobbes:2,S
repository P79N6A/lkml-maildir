The recent talk about fs unions (mounting more than one set of
files at the same mount point and merging the dir. contents) is
certainly intriguing.  
Would the feature be limited to two mounts per point?  Would it
only allow mounts from the same drive, same partition, same
locale (meaning local vs. networked), or from any valid drives?
How would file creations be handled (assuming all unioned file 
space is R/W)?  I imagine there would have to be some very 
specific rules governing this, e.g. the first mount is considered the 
"primary" one and gets all file creations, barring any override from 
the user/programmer.  (And no, I haven't considered exactly how 
such an override should be done.)  Or does the location with the 
most free space get the new file?  Or would file creations be 
prevented entirely?  (That would certainly clean things up for the 
implementation, but it could create severe usability problems, 
so is probably not feasible.)
To create a fully-realized implementation, would there have
to be modifications to commands or facilities to take into account
or exploit the fs unions?  If so, this might be a way for some others 
to contribute to the effort and produce a better integration of the 
feature into the Linux environment.
