Rene,
Here is why you shouldn't leap so quickly to rudeness.  Everything is
being repeated over and over and over again (as you put it) because
people like you shout down people like me without making any apparent
effort to understand the truth of the problem.

The problem is that _p is widely used for non-ISA devices.  For example,
a quick grep reveals the following (and more) all use outb_p:
    ./i2c/busses/i2c-amd756.c
    ./i2c/busses/i2c-ali1535.c
    ./i2c/busses/i2c-ali15x3.c
    ./i2c/busses/i2c-i801.c
    ./i2c/busses/i2c-piix4.c
    ./i2c/busses/i2c-viapro.c
    ./i2c/busses/i2c-nforce2.c
    ./i2c/busses/i2c-ali1563.c
    ./telephony/ixj.c
    ./char/pc8736x_gpio.c
    ./char/epca.c
    ./char/dtlk.c
    ./char/watchdog/w83697hf_wdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/wafer5823wdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/wdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/sc1200wdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/pc87413_wdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/wdt_pci.c
    ./char/watchdog/w83977f_wdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/pcwd_pci.c
    ./char/watchdog/w83877f_wdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/mixcomwd.c
    ./char/watchdog/w83627hf_wdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/advantechwdt.c
    ./char/watchdog/ib700wdt.c

    ./char/rocket_int.h
    ./char/sonypi.c
Most of these go nowhere near the ISA bus.  This has been said before,
but perhaps you missed that.  Which is another reason to use good
manners, isn't it?
The argument that you can't know how long to delay is utter rubbish.

I think I'm saying something useful.  I'll keep an eye out for your
humble apology.  (Are you big enough to give one?)   In the mean time,
perhaps you'll follow your own advice and say something useful or go
away.  :-p
I hope you'll see this in the positive and constructive light that it is
intended.
