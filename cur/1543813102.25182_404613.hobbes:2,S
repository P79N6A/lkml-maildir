It's still more expensive than local_t.

Last time I checked, all the major architectures had efficient local_t 
implementations.  Most of the RISC CPUs are able to do a load / store 
conditional implementation that is the same cost (since memory barriers 
tend to be explicite on powerpc).  So why not use it?
