Why?  What's the point?  You are asking to paper over the way the kernel
works (remember storage devices are on lots of different kinds of busses
today...)
The fact that a static /dev keeps these race conditions from showing up
as often as they really are there is no reason to keep trying to rely on
old, undefined behaviour :)
