Don't know if this idea has been brought up before, but a lot of mailing lists
make a habit of putting the name of the list in brackets in the subject, as I
have
done. This is a cool thing because it allows people to easily set up scripts to
filter their mail into folders. Having about 4 mailing list subscriptions I find
it a
valuable feature. Anyone else think this is a good idea?
