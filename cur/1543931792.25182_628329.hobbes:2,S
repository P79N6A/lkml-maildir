And hence the big idea that all reserve accounting can be done in units
of pages, allowing the use of a single global reserve that already 
exists.
The other big idea here is that reserve accounting can be independent of 
the actual resource allocations.  This is a powerful idea which we may 
not have explained clearly yet.
