I'm now stumped also. I tested
2.6.4-rc2 CONFIG.*DMA.*MODE=1: ok
2.6.4-rc2+bk-scsi CONFIG.*DMA.*MODE=1: ok
2.6.4-rc2+bk-scsi+dma_sync CONFIG.*DMA.*MODE=1: ok
then I recompiled a fresh 2.6.3-mm4 kernel from source with
CONFIG.*DMA.*MODE=1, and it booted also.
So it appears to (have) be(en) a Heisenbug. It was there, when I
recompiled, it was gone.
Oh well,
Jurriaan

Of course I am.
What?
I'm going to ignore it.
