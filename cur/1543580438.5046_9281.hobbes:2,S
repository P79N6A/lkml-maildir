Subject: drive/block device write scheduling, buffer flushing?

I was wondering if there is a way to make the kernel write to disk faster. 
I need to maintain a 10 MB /sec write rate to a 10K scsi disk in a computer,
but it caches and doesn't start writing to disk until I hit about 700 MB. At
that point, it pauses(presumably while the kernel is flushing some of the
buffers) and I will have missed data that I am trying to capture.
Any ideas?
Nathan
