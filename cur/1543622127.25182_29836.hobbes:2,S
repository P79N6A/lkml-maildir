1) it is a Linux kernel standard.  all arches save two define
CONFIG_$arch.
2) you have two tests, "ARCH==m68k" in config.in and "__mc68000__" in C
code.  CONFIG_M68K means you only test one symbol, the same symbol, in
all code.
3) as this thread shows, due to #1, users -expect- that CONFIG_M68K will
exist
