I've certainly seen a similar thing with an NT machine.  Keyboard no
longer responding, mouse worked fine.  I don't remember if a warm reboot
fixed the problem or if I had to lose the power.

I guess time will tell if changing the mice over will have any effect.  Is
it even possible for the PS/2 mouse to affect the PS/2 keyboard in this
way?  I don't know how PS/2 works.
A bad keyboard shouldn't be able to freeze the operating system though, as
appeared to happen when I reported this at the beginning of the thread.
Am I wrong in thinking that this can happen in handle_kbd_event?
Tim.
