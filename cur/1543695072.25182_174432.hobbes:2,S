   First. Network stack is already hand-optimized.
   Second. It will not make software firewall/routers running faster - 
especially regarding latencies - bottleneck is elsewhere.
   Just FYI.
P.S. Actually I find Linux kernel being quite good hand optimized 
already. But in any way, life in kernel would be made easier have we 
decent portable compiler. But as to compilers 'decent portable' really 
sounds like 'mission imposible'. And primary goal of gcc sure standard 
conformance and portability - and it does this well. That's actually why
we are using it ;-)
