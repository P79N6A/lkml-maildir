If there is no filesystem in the device, you just get the probe
transfers. Not very interesting, indeed. Some filesystems have their
magic number in the first sector, and some have it later in the device.

Before you state it's wrong you should see some effect. In your case
there is no effect at all. If you make a filesystem on the device you'll
see it works. So if this concerns you, you should look for an explanation
rather than saying it is wrong.
> Does someone have any clue, why sbull gets this value as 0 rather then 0x20? 
I suspect because the device is not partitioned, while the other one is,
so every transfer just is done inside the partition (while the low-level
access uses absolute sector number of the device).
