POSIX requires a reschedule to occur, as noted here:
http://blog.firetree.net/2005/06/22/thread-yield-after-mutex-unlock/
The relevant SUSv3 text is here
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/pthread_mutex_unlock.html
I suppose if pthread_mutex_unlock() actually behaved correctly we could 
remove the other sched_yield() hacks that didn't belong there in the 
first place and go on our merry way.
