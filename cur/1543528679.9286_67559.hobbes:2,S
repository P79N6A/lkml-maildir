InterMezzo High Availability File System
----------------------------------------
InterMezzo is a file system inspired by Coda with replicated persistent
caches and disconnected operation.  It uses an existing disk file system
as a cache and as a server storage location.
We have just released a new version that is substantially further along
than the previous tagged release.  You can find it at
http://www.inter-mezzo.org
 and the HOWTO gives installation instructions. 
WARNING: this is early beta software which contains kernel code and
daemons running with root permissions.  Back up all your data and only use
this in a secure environment.  The file COPYING explains the warranties
and license for the software (the GPL).
We are actively working on this and the next release will contain
journaled recovery using Ext3.  You can follow the developments by
subscribing to the intermezzo-devel mailing list.  We also provide
anonymous CVS access. Our project will move to SourceForge over the next
few weeks and we will use Bugzilla for further project management and bug
tracking.
We encourage everyone to play with this and report bugs and problems to
us.  Thanks for your interest!
