I disagree about this being an uglification.  But beauty is obviously
in the eye of the beholder...
Anyhow, you clearly feel _much_ stronger about this particular issue
than I do and I haven't heard much from Andrew, so I'll make a local
version of sort_extable() for now.  If someone cares about
resurrecting a generic version, they can do that later on.
