Are you saying you have swap _files_ or is that a typo?  Not to say that this
is illegal or anything, but it sure is a waste of CPU/disk performance.  If
you are swapping to a file on a journaled filesystem, you have a huge amount
of unnecessary overhead.  Rather have a swap partition and avoid the fs
altogether.
It is also possible that there are still problems with the core kernel swap
code, and they are just more noticable when swapping on ext3.  What form of
journaling are you using?  Ordered, writeback, or full data journaling?

I've CC'd this to ext2-devel, where the core ext3 developers are more likely
to see it.
