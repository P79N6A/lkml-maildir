Very good, thanks ! But it seems that your checker doesn't know about
dev_kfree_skb or kfree_skb. Also, it might be good to have a sorted
table of content (i.e. each file listed only once) at the beginning
of the posting - otherwise, it's quite hard to see if there's anything
one feels responsible for.
I saw that in a later posting, you switched to tar.gz. I think an
easily readable ASCII version is more useful. Otherwise, only people
who already expect problems will actually look at it ...
