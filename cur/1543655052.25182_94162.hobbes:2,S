Subject: [PATCH] bugfix for HIGHMEM_DEBUG
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Marcelo,
I found a bug in the HIGHMEM_DEBUG code, in kunmap_atomic()
to be specific.  The problem is that kunmap_atomic() can get
called with an address which isn't page aligned, but we compare
that address to a page aligned address and bug if the two
aren't equal.
The obvious fix is to page-align the address before doing the
check, we're not doing anything else with it anyway since
kunmap_atomic() is a nop if HIGHMEM_DEBUG is off.
please apply,
Rik
