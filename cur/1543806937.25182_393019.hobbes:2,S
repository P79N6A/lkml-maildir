well, IMHO this approach lacks a few things which would
be very useful in a mainline pid virtualization, which
pretty much explains why it is relatively small
 - hierarchical structure (it's flat, only one level)
 - a proper administration scheme
 - a 'view' into the child pid spaces
 - handling of inter context signalling
and, more important, it does not deal with the existing
issues and error cases, where references to pids, tasks,
task groups and sessions aren't handled properly ...
I think that in real world virtualization scenarios
with hundreds of namespaces those 'imprecisions' will 
occasionally lead to very strange and random behaviour
which in many cases will go completely unnoticed.
so I really prefer to cleanup the existing pid handling
first, to avoid big surprises later ...
best,
Herbert
