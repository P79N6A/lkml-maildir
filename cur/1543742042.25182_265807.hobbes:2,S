Both tests compiling 2.6.9 tree with make -j192 bzImage modules
(.config posted earlier) from clean source after a reboot.
2CPUs, 2GB RAM, 2GB swap
2.4.27
real    15m38.504s
user    21m5.720s
sys     3m28.990s
peaked at about 1.7GB swap usage
2.6.9
real    14m50.360s
user    21m9.008s
sys     2m40.580s
peaked at 2.0GB swap usage - top said 0K swap free and it survived ;)
2.6.9 was 5% faster (although subjectively almost a magnitude more
responsive ie. sshing into the box in the middle of this took
about a minute with 2.4.27 and only about 10 or so seconds with 2.6.9,
although i didn't time this).
Seems 2.6's more proactive swapping helps a bit ie. swap more of
the right stuff so as to swap less overall as 2.6 went about 20%
deeper into swap.
