  Hi, all. Version 155 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.43. Highlights of this release:
- Ported to kernel 2.3.43-pre8
- Moved /dev/tty0 to /dev/vc/0
- Moved sequence number formatting from <_tty_make_name> to drivers
				Regards,
					Richard....
