To clear things up:
* The intent of the doc is to help kernel developers
* The intent was NOT to advertise BK
* An unavoidable side effect of the doc's presence is implicit advertisement
* I certainly promote the use of BitKeeper
Please keep these things separate...
To imply that the BK doc is an intentioned advertisement is silly.
It's in the kernel source tree to help people with, like it or not, what
is a part of kernel development.  An _optional_ part.
