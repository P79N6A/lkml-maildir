Yes, that is a problem for some people. But you should
have used an unique number in the first place.
There are some hackish ways to work around it for non modules[1], but at some
point we should probably support it better.
[1] it can be handled, except for module unloading, so you have
to disable that.

Did you actually measure it? I doubt it is a big issue.
