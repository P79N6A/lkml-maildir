i'm pretty sure there's already been a thread on LKML about it ... the
fact that our parts currently lack any sort of cache snooping or
control over any other is a huge issue.
we've contracted a company to do SMP, but it'll have quite a bit of
overhead since it'll need to do a lot of communication/message passing
between cores to account for these hardware deficiencies.
