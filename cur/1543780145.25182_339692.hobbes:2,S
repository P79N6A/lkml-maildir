If ShadowWolf interpretation of Alejandro's question is right and
Alejandro trying to run the LDD2 books examples on 2.6.8-2 then they
won't work on 2.6.x kernel or not even compile
successfully............ That LDD2 book is for 2.2 and 2.4 kernel
series and LDD3 is for 2.6 series, so go for LDD3 for your 2.6.x
kernel ..........
