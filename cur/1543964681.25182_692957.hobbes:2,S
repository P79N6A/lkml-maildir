Technically, it could also happen on PPC (APUS), but all APUS support got
removed a few months ago.
So maybe CONFIG_ZORRO is more appropriate?
(CONFIG_ZORRO8390 || CONFIG_ZORRO8390_MODULE is probably frowned upon?)

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
