If absolute temperature is not known, could we move it to some
obviously invalid range, so that people would not treat it as absolute
temperature?
Like, set tjmax == 0K, and report relative temperatures below 0K? Or
move it to 100-200C range, which is obviously invalid?
Or maybe invent 'relative temperature' attribute?

Uff, does it differ between cpus with same stepping/etc?
