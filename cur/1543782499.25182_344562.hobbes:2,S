The 8192 limit is the total watches in use at one time. If over time,
you use more than 8192 watches but not all at one time you will just
keep getting higher and higher wd's. I'm not 100% sure if idr handles it
gracefully.

There isn't a 1024 limit, that is a bug in the idr code. He got to that
number by having used 1024 wd's throughout the life of the program.'
FYI, if we pass 0 to idr_get_new_above, both your test programs work
fine. But the first one re-uses wd's (back and forth between 0 & 1).
