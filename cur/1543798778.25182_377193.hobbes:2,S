I said a Jack Russell _is_ a dog, but a dog is not a Jack Russell.
Everything you can say about a dog you can't say about a Jack Russell.
Since, a dog can have other characteristics than a Jack Russell has. A dog
can be big and lazy, but I would not say that about a Jack Russell.

But a counting semaphore of (one) _is_ a mutex!  But a mutex can't have
more than one.   As for David's code, that's just arguing implementation,
and not the semantics of it.
