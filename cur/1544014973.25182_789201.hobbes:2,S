ipset runs in kernel too, you just add/remove entries from userspace
without having to touch all other ones. It has no problem storing one
million addresses and doing fast lookups on them.
I'm not dismissing your work, I just think it's a duplicate effort.
Also, since you're speaking about botnets, you should support automatic
expiration of those addresses, because almost all those addresses are
dynamic and will match a bot for a small amount of time, then match a
normal non-infected user. One of the reasons you found 500k addresses
might very well be because each bot appears one hundred times at different
addresses.
