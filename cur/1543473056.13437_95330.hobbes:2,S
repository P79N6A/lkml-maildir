As I said before, there is _nothing_ in /dev/random that the application
itself can't do, so this is at the very least a waste of a system call. Not
exactly efficient.

They are available on every Unixy system I know. If not, you can cobble
something up using the shell (a while loop + echo). Or you do have some
compiler at hand, so you can write a C (or whatever) proggie, using
random(3) as needed.
