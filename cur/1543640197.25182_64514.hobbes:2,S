root/vm/buddyinfo   ?
Ah, a gregfs, making up the components that describe me...that's going
to be a pretty ugly looking fs...

All it takes is one line added to /etc/fstab mounting driverfs at /sys.
As the code is not a .config option, you are using it if you mount it or
not :)  The fact that no one else will look at that mount point,
shouldn't matter to you.
And yes, for just one thing (hey, why don't you move _all_ the vm stats
over to it), it is worth adding that one line.  And you'll eventually
have to do it anyway, as these things _will_ be moving there.
Hell, tell me which machine you are using, and I'll go add it.

I don't have to like the name to like what it does, and is used for,
right?
