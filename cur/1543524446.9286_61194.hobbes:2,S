Subject: query "interface max. bandwith" from userspace

When using UCD-SNMP <url: 
http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/>
 it reports the
incorrect max. bandwidth, interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifSpeed.  After
looking at the source it seems that OTHER unixen have methods for
determining the correct max. bandwidth.  With Linux they're guessing how
big the interface is and the type (i.e..
interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType) by looking at the interface name
(i.e.. all eth's are 10 Mb/S, and ethernet-csmacd(6)).
...the question...
What is the proper way to determine the max. bandwidth (interface type)
of a network interface from userspace?
