Well, Oleg, I'd love to, but there is an immanent problem with that. If
I check pre-X and it crashes, everything is fine, because I have a certain
result of the test. If it does not crash within 3 days, then I have a problem.
How long do I wait before stating the pre is good? It could take months to test
10 pre's ... That cannot be the way to find out what is going on. 
On the other hand: 
- no UP kernel ever crashed. So we can at least talk about an SMP-race.
- 2.4.20 does not crash
- 2.4.21 does crash
If we can add "ext3 does not crash" to the list, then I really hope we can use
some brain and give good selection of patches between 2.4.20 and 2.4.21 that
may cause the troubles.
How many suspects do we have? We can at least begin to create a list of things
that went in between .20 and .21, or not?
If possible I can then patch out all of them and retry. So there is much less
time spent for testing. 
I mean, have you looked at the length of this thread already?

You mean I should do an fsck on sunday?

I have never seen this in real life. Is it possible to turn this on when
handling >100 GB of data or will some debug output flood the box?
