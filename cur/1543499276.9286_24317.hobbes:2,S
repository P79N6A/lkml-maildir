I assume the separate bus you are refering to is an MVIP bus.  It is
actually so seperate that the computer (and hence the kernel) doesn't
even know it exists.  The MVIP bus is used to move voice (i.e. PCM) data
between CT adapters.  See 
http://www.mvip.org
 for more info.

Yes, you would usually need device driver support for the adapters.
Though sometimes you can do it all in user space.  Some CT adapter
suppliers (Aculab for example) have already released drivers for Linux.
