I'm thinking that Eric's pidns-place-under-config_experimental.patch is for
2.6.24, so I attempted to rework your patches atop that but gave up on the
last one.
So if we're agreeeable, can you please redo these against next -mm, thanks.
Also, please do put a little thought into the choice of patch subjects. 
"the config option itself" will look rather dopey if it goes into the
permanent kernel record under that name.
Probably putting "CONFIG_NAMESPACES: " in front of each of these would
suit.
