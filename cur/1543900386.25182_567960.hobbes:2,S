Oops.  Missed a revert.  Sorry 'bout that.

I was under the vague impression I'd read that, but going back I see that
diffstat is first mentioned on line 437 in the next to last paragraph
before "tips and tricks".  That's in paragraph 12 of point 14, and that's
counting the indented list elements as part of the proceeding paragraph.
Is there anything that could be done to make that document longer and more
rambling?  I see that last time I read it, I stopped during "Developers
Certificate of Origin 1.1", which is some kind of strange non-license license
which is more recent than the signed-off-by lines, but seems to be
retroactively stating that signed-off-by means you've read that thing...?  Is
that expected to hold up in court, is it just one of those random 1980's
shrinkware-license style intimidation tactics, is it some weird kind of
fraternity pledge...?
(/me goes to read up on diffstat...  Ah, I see, it's a program you install.  I
thought it was a diff option.  So possibly you could make SubmittingPatches
longer by mentioning that.)
With that file reverted, it's:
