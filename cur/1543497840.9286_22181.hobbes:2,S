Subject: stable kernel macro?

Is there a generic way to detect, via the C pre-processor, whether the
kernel is a stable or experimental series?
I would like to do something in my code like
#if LINUX_SERIES_EXPERIMENTAL
#define assert (expr) if (!(expr)) {...}
#else /* LINUX_SERIES_STABLE, or neither symbol exists */
#define assert (expr)
#endif
so that lightweight assertions are in the experimental series, but
magically disappear in the stable series.
Thanks,
	Jeff
