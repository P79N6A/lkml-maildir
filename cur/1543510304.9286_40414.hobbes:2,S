Throws much doubt on the hardware theory, I guess.

me2.  Only, mine is all-scsi.  BL FlashPoint--BT932, on an Asus P5A with
a K6-350, not OCed, and 64M RAM.  Seagate 4.3G SCSI HD, Panasonic 24x
CD, JVC XR-W2010 CDR. SiS 6326-based AGP card w/8M RAM on it. Walked
into my office this morning, and it was locked up tight.  Magic keys and
all--nothing doing.  No messages in the logs, nothing to indicate why it
locked up.  This is a fairly common occurence with the 2.2.x kernels, as
evidenced by the numerous messages in the archives.  It also seems to
happen over a wide range of hardware and under differing loads.  I know
mine must have happened at or before 4:00am, though, because the
locatedb didn't get updated this morning.  The ctime on it was for
yesterday morning at 4:00.  Unless it could crash in the middle of
updating w/o changing the ctime...
Another problem is that the crashes are random, apparently.  So, we have
random crashes which happen for no apparent reason. I haven't had one in
a while, though.  THis is my first with 2.2.12, actually...
One thing that occurs to me--at what vga level do those who are crashing
start Linux?  I generally start mine in fb mode 0317, and run X of
course, which might possibly cause a problem.  Shouldn't, though, I
don't think.  Other commonalities? THere's gotta be something similar
between all these crashes!
