FC6 with latest updates.

I do have. md1 md2 md3 -- raid0, 1, 0. But there is no md0 (removed in the past)
and 'raidautorun /dev/md0 | nash' causes the troubles.

Yup. Monolithic as much as possible (md is in the kernel and so dm is). / on the
lvm2 on the /dev/md1 with no initrd. All are sata disks, so sd_mod, sata_promise
and ata_piix are in the kernel.

Hm, I have never seen FC6 installation process, so I can't say what special
option I have turned on -- it's 'yum upgrade'd from FC5, FC4...
