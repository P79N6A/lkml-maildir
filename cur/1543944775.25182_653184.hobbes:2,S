Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86: sparse error in efi_32.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/13/502

include/linux/efi.h does not include asm/efi.h, efi.c and efi_64.c
explicitly include both.  While not really right, add the include
to efi_32.c until the header gets sorted out.
arch/x86/kernel/efi_32.c:42:6: warning: symbol 'efi_call_phys_prelog' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/x86/kernel/efi_32.c:84:6: warning: symbol 'efi_call_phys_epilog' was not declared. Should it be static?
