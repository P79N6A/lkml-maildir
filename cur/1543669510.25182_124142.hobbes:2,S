Hi!
  Here are the latest framebuffer changes. Some driver updates and a 
massive cleanup of teh cursor code. Tony please test it on the i810 
chipset. I tested it on the Riva but there is one bug I can't seem to 
find. Please test this patch. It is against 2.5.67 BK. It shoudl work 
against 2.5.67 as well. 
Please test. 
Standard patch is at 
http://phoenix.infradead.org/~jsimmons/fbdev.diff.gz
and you can do a bk pull

<jsimmons@kozmo.(none)> (03/04/02 1.991.1.2)
   [FBDEV SOFT CURSOR] Test to see if kmalloc failed.
   
   [FBCON] Test to see if the user priovides there own work queue.
<jsimmons@kozmo.(none)> (03/04/02 1.991.1.1)
   [FBDEV] Final cursor code cleanups. Now the burden of handling the cursor code lies on the driver side. The reason for this is that a invalid cursor might come from userland.
<jsimmons@kozmo.(none)> (03/03/31 1.990)
   [FBDEV] Massive cleanups of the cursor api.
<jsimmons@maxwell.earthlink.net> (03/03/26 1.986)
   [FBDEV] Documentation on the device numbers of /dev/fb being mulitples of 32 is no longer true. Removed that info.
   
   [FBDEV] Logo fixes. Now we can display different color logos on screens of different color depths.
   
   [VGA16 FBDEV] Small compile error. Fixed it now.
<jsimmons@maxwell.earthlink.net> (03/03/26 1.984)
   [I810 FBDEV] Driver updates.
   
   [FBCON] Reversed some of my cursor changes.
<jsimmons@kozmo.(none)> (03/03/25 1.983)
   [FBDEV] The image color depth of zero hack has been killed.
<jsimmons@maxwell.earthlink.net> (03/03/25 1.982)
   [FBCON] Now we use workqueues so framebuffer code can always work in a process context.
   
   [GENERIC CURSOR] Safety check in case kmalloc failes
<jsimmons@maxwell.earthlink.net> (03/03/25 1.981)
   [FBCON] Could be called outside of a process context. This fixes that.
<jsimmons@maxwell.earthlink.net> (03/03/25 1.979)
