I am saddened to say that I agree with you now that all the info is in
hand.  However, I do not think IBM is the driving force now...
It is now just the C4 extortion^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Horganization sponsoring
the mess and they are not in the committee by name.
The good news is that I know how to kill it and protect Linux....
The bad news is I will not fight for the taskfile-filter code to protect
the OS, I will just publish it.  And yes it does look like a possible
security risk now because of the rogue-java that does exist but is not
released.
Please do not start another war, I do not have the time or desire to fight
this one again...the policy of noe policies is not true, because we have
a policy to disable the PII/PIII serial-number access.
