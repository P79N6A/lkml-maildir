I just tested this. 2.6.18 does not crash. I still get tons of errors,
and no data. Copying using 1MB chunks or 4kB chunks
don't matter, it doesn't work.  So card, reader or driver must be faulty.
The card works in a windows machine though.
2.6.19-rc1 gets data with 4kB chunks, and BUGs with 1M chunks.

2.6.18 wasn't tried before, the reason being I did not have this
card reader when 2.6.18 was current.
dmesg output for 2.6.18 (after the dd attempts) is attached.  I have
edited out stuff that isn't usb or scsi.
