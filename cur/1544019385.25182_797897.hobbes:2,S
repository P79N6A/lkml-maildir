In this case, we're talking about what happens when the assembly takes a
64-bit input operand in the same register as a 32-bit output operand
(with a "0" constraint.)  Is the output operand the same register number
as the high register or the low register?  On an LE machine the answer
is trivial and obvious -- the low register; on a BE machine both
interpretations are possible (I actually suspect gcc will assign the
high register, just based on how gcc internals work in this case.)
