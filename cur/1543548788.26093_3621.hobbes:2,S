In page_launder() about halfway down there is this sequence of tests
on LRU pages:
if (!clearedbuf) {
 ...
} else if (!page->mapping) {
 ...
} else if (page_count(page) > 1) {
} else /* page->mapping && page_count(page) == 1 */ {
 ...
}
Above this sequence we've done a page_cache_get.  For the final case
in the tests above (page->mapping != NULL && page_count(page) == 1)
have you checked if this ever happens or is even possible?
If the page is a page cache page (ie. page->mapping != NULL) it
should hold a reference.  Adding in our reference, the count should
always thus be > 1.
What did I miss?
