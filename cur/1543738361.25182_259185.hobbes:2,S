Hi everybody,
I compiled the linux 2.6.9-rc3-mm3 kernel successfully (config attached) and
wanted to boot it but after a few moments it stops booting. Only a hard
reset helps.
It works till the line
PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:0010.1, from 0 to 5
then it just stops and nothing more happens.
I think something related to USB comes afterwards, comparing the booting
with an older
kernel. I don't know what happens and I don't really know how to debug it,
as I never debugged a kernel
before so every help is welcome.
I use Gentoo Linux, gcc 3.4.2, reiser4 and udev.
Kind regards,
