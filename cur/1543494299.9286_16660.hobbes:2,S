I have finally tested your VM code using 2.2.7 and 2.2.7andrea patch and
i have to say that it add performance but no too much in the HINT
benchmark, the graph is tha same and in tha last part (swap) it raise a
little but the graph in the last part is minimized so is a real gain in
performance,
i calculate like 10%, congratulations!
Hope will be integrated in the next release :)
