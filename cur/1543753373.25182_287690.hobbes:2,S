But since it didn't go to the linux-pci mailing list, I never saw it.
So I never reviewed it.

Ah, I thought you were talking about something for the generic device
model.  If you don't have that in mind, then a multiplexing driver is
probably the right way to do it.

That doesn't make much sense.  Either you want things to be reviewed
or you don't.  If you want them reviewed, you send them to linux-pci.
Why should it be any different from linux-scsi, linux-ide, netdev or
linux-mm?
