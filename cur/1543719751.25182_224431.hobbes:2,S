Nope.

It does make the code a bit hard to follow, but yes, evaluating `current'
takes ~14 bytes of text on x86.  Although I think recent versions of the
compiler are able to cse it.
Still, the right way to do this is to lose all the dopey `p's and `tsk's
and adopt a convention of using `this_task' or some such identifier.

There's still one put to go - that happens at the end of
finish_task_switch(), via the next-to-run process.

The problem is task_struct.sighand, not the task_struct itself.  ->sighand
can be thrown away while update_process_times() is still poking at it.
hmm, maybe it _is_ sufficient to null out current->it_prof_value and
current->it_virt_incr in the do_exit() path.  Because in *this* case we know
that it is always the exitting task which is doing the nulling, so the
timer interrupt cannot run on a different CPU.
