by "no change", you mean "still loss of 5s" ?
If this is the case, are you sure the switch port you are connected to is
in full duplex too ? does it detect receive errors or carrier lost ? I
believe that cisco switches in "spanning tree portfast" mode block the port
during 5s after a renegociation. It's easy to detect because the port's led
becomes orange.
perhaps you can switch the 2 NIC's cables to check if the problem follows the 
cable or the NIC.
else I have no other clue ...

Willy
