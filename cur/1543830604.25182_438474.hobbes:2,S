Hi Sergey, many thanks for the reply.
I saw those links before but I did not get their full meaning.
By setting uppermem to 512M it does actually work. However, now I'm trying to 
reserve RAM for DMA sake. For that I use mem=1899M; where 1899 comes from the 
total memory reported under normal booting less 128M, which are the Megs that 
I'm trying to reserve.
It seems that by adding mem to the boot line goes into conflicting with the 
uppermem+vmalloc arrangement.
Without providing more details on what's actually happening can you tell that 
there is something wrong on what I'm trying to do?
Would switching to lilo help any?
thanks,
  Rodrigo
