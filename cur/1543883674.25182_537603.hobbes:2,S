The problem is the macro evaluates to
	outb(reg, 0x22);
	[Then the getCx86]
	outb(data, 0x23);
which isn't valid for 6x86 control. Looks like someone overoptimised it.
Either make it "inline" or split it up and it'll work

Agreed - they must be issued in order in the right way as they are CPU
level magic.
