That's compiler bug obviously.
Anyways I guess you're triggering compiler bugs because of the weird
optimizations (-O4). Note also that everything over -O2 is _wrongly_ used to
inline everything and that will trash away all your icache (I remeber
also Linus complained about that bad behaviour of >-O2 in the past and
it's also trivial to fix [shouldn't be more than a one liner], but nobody on
the gcc side seems to care to fix it since it's still impling the
inline-functions in gcc CVS of a few weeks ago).
I triggered various compiler bugs both in 2.7.2.3 and egcs in the past but
they're should be sorted out in 18pre21aa2 patchkit. If you can still trigger
compiler bugs with the _default_ compiler options please let me know and I'll
work around them. 2.95.2 compiles it fine for me.
