FYI, this happens on the sparc arch as well, No, I can't test it.  I no
longer have the speaker box, it never would work for me (the exp dbri driver
kept crashing the kernel.  No, I don't have logs of that because I started
over).
I just thought you'd like to know that x86 wasn't the only arch having that
prob.
