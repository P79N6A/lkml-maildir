   Not exactly the question you asked - but an alternative thought.
   I wonder what interest there might would be in an open source 
   one-time-password secure id type card? 
   Not sure how easy it would be to make reset/resync the card to
   the server random sequence via something - serial/usb/ethernet?
   Something like an rsa secureid card but open source server?
   I am sure community could help program the server side?
   Not sure of the business implications as large institutions
   can afford to amortize a larger cost - however small businesses, 
   eductional institutions and home users might be very happy 
   with a standard secure remote access facility. 
   Again OEM's might be happy to have this as a standard option - 
   you know an sell the cards as a standard addon - small or large quantity.
   Thoughts?
