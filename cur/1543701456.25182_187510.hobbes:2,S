My preference is either:
 - we can still undo the "nopage" argument change. It's been in the -mm 
   tree for a long time, and it _does_ solve a problem (page fault type 
   accounting), but the problem it solves is potentially so small that we
   might decide it's ok for 2.6.x.
   However, Andrew is king, and besides, it does fix a tiny bug, so I 
   don't think this is what we should do. I just wanted to put it on the 
   table as a possibility.
 - Use separate (and trivial) wrapper functions for this. Keep the "real" 
   function the same across everything, and just have a _static_ function 
   (ie no header file declaration crap) that does
   linux-new-vm.h:
	static int DRM(nopage_interface)(struct vm_area_struct * area, 
					 unsigned long address,
					 int *type)
	{
		*type = VM_FAULT_MINOR;
		DRM(nopage)(area, address);
	}
   linux-old-vm.h:
	static int DRM(nopage_interface)(struct vm_area_struct * area,
					 unsigned long address,   
					 int unused)
	{
		DRM(nopage)(area, address);
	}
   drm_vm.h:
	/*
	 * Or, poreferably, we could create a symlink and avoid
	 * the #if's at compile-time _entirely_.
	 */
	#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,0)
	  #include "linux-new-vm.h"
	#else
	  #include "linux-old-v.h
	#endif
	..
	.nopage = nopage_interface;
	..
Done right, the virtualization could be a bit higher still, and maybe 
the BSD code can do the same thing.
In general, at least I personally _much_ prefer the #ifdef's etc to be 
outside the code. So even if you don't like to have separate small files 
for different architectures/ports/versions, I'd at least personally 
much rather have
	#if xxxx
	int onewholefunction(..)
	...
	
	#else
	int onewholefunction(..)
	...
	#endif
rather than the messy
	int onewholefunction(
	#if xxx
	..
	#else
	..
	#endif
	(
	{
	...
	#if xxxx
	..
	#endif
The latter is a huge pain not just to read (you go blind after a while), 
but it's also painful as _hell_ to merge anywhere else.
In contrast, full-file interfaces for different kernel versions are a 
_lot_ easier to merge and keep track of. They may look like "duplication", 
but the advantages are legion. You don't mix different OS's and different 
versions together, and that makes it much easier to support them all 
without going crazy.
