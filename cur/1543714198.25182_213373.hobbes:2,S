actually, this one: "move-__this_module-to-modpost.patch" started breaking 
nvidia, but strangely not for all people. For me it worked fine (prior to 
2.6.5-mm4), but other people got "invalid module format" after compiling 
nvidia driver and tried to load it. P.S.: kbuild-external-module-support 
breaks VMware too :p

I hope it will go into mainline after the glitches are fixed up. The problem 
is, Andrew and friends need proper bug reports to fix these kind of things 
up asap. If no one speaks up about a problem, everyone expect its working fine 
for all, so go for it into mainline.
ciao, Marc
