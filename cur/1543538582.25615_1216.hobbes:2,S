I've got a seeming bug with mfw. Here's the situation:
Kernel 2.2.16, mfw compiled as a module, all ip masquerading options but
the netlink (?) device.
I'm attempting to forward a port on one machine (dynamic ip, port 23) to
another machine (10.10.10.4, port 23). It doesn't appear to work.
Same problem when I use the local IP (10.10.10.1) on that box.
When attempting to portforward with ipmasqadm, nothing happens. Connection
times out. 
Command: ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L 10.10.10.1 23 -R 10.10.10.4 23
When marking a packet with ipchains then using mfw, it gets connection
refused.
Commands: 	ipchains -I input 1 -y -p tcp -d 0/0 23 -m 1
		ipmasqadm mfw -A -m 1 -r 10.10.10.4 23
Ideas? Suggestions? This is a last resort. I've been going at this for hours.
