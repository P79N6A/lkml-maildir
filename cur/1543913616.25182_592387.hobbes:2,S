Subject: USB and MMC device problems on Kernel 2.6.22

Sorry for not clear about the kernel version, let me try again:
I have an ARM hardware board works fine with USB and MMC on kernel 
2.6.11. Now, I've just upgraded it to kernel 2.6.22. The modules seem 
loaded fine, please see following list, but neither USB nor MMC could 
detect devices when a USB stick or SD card was plugged in (I enabled 
module debug, but nothing printed out, no device node created in /dev). 
It seems some processes were not running, but I can see usbd and mmcd 
were running at following list, or what is missing?

I understand that the devfs is no longer supported by the kernel 2.6.22, 
but should the modules still be able to detect the devices? I manually 
created nodes on /dev tree such as /dev/mmc /dev/scsi before building 
and downloading to the target. Any clues please?
