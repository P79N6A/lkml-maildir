If the struct is padded to 6 bytes and the linker aligns it to 4 byte
everything will be naturally aligned, as far as I can see.

So this message tells me the table size is 64 bytes. There are 8 entries,
so it seems the structure is padded to 8 bytes.
But above that it says that sizeof(struct ssb_device_id)=6
IMO this sanity check is broken and not the code.
Where does this sanity check message come from? The linker?
