One approach is the Solaris Doors design.  There is a
Linux/Doors project; even outperforms Solaris on some benchmarks. :-)

Of course, CORBA services abstract this behavior.  With something like
GNOME ORBit, it is possible to make calls to a shared library, a server
process on the same machine, or a server process on another machine.
By supporting a spectrum of binding policies (from lazy to eager), one
can optimize the local cases by eliminating (de)marshalling, RPC, etc.
