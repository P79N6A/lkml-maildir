This is rather long.  For the utility of what you've just done, what's
wrong with just making the .unlocked_ioctl point to sg_unlocked_ioctl()
and doing:
sg_unlocked_ioctl()
	int rc;
	lock_kernel();
	rc = sg_ioctl();
	unlock_kernel();
	return rc;
}
Really, all this is doing is open coding what the ioctl handler is doing
anyway, isn't it? in which case, why bother to change it at all?
