You get I/O errors when you submit write requests, which is definitely
not good. I don't know if it also has security implications.
A check got lost in the char dev control device conversion patch. The
patch below fixes it.
-
If you tried to open a packet device first in read-only mode and then
a second time in read-write mode, the second open succeeded even
though the device was not correctly set up for writing. If you then
tried to write data to the device, the writes would fail with I/O
errors.
This patch prevents that problem by making the second open fail with
-EBUSY.
