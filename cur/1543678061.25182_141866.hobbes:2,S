I wonder about the apparent proliferation of entries under /sys/class/.  
If people continue to add things like /sys/class/usb-storage/ right at the
top level, won't it become rather unwieldy?  What would be a good place to
put something like that?

[Two different replies to related questions of mine.]
This makes sense.  But it doesn't match my experience working with the 
SCSI core.  (That experience is connected with usb-storage, not aic7xxx.)
When a host driver registers a newly-detected host adapter with the core,
it doesn't provide a structure representing that adapter.  It provides a
Scsi Host Template, but that's not the same thing.  Instead, the core
creates a struct Scsi_Host on the driver's behalf.  Embedded in it is a
struct device, which is registered under /sys/devices/, and a struct
class_device, which is registered under /sys/class/scsi_host/.  The driver
doesn't own these structures; the SCSI core does.
Furthermore, there is no release() for the embedded struct class_device,
so there's no way for the driver to know when it goes away.  (That lack is
liable to cause a problem at some point.  I noticed that until very
recently there was no release() method for struct class_device at all.)  
There _is_ a release notification for the overall struct Scsi_Host in
scsi_remove_host(), but it occurs at the wrong time.  It is called right
after the embedded struct device has been deregistered, not when its
reference count drops to 0.
So what Mike says the SCSI core does, and what Pat says it ought to do, 
isn't what actually happens.  Is this simply an indication that the work 
of completing the SCSI code to the driver model isn't yet complete?  It 
seems as though a very large change would be needed to make things work as 
Pat described.
In the meantime, where should I register my class device for the 
usb-storage driver?  Should it go in 
/sys/class/scsi_host/host1/usb-storage/, under the existing class device?  
That might be simplest.  Or should there be a new class just for it?
