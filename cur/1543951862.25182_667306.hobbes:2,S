[PATCH] mm: make free_bootmem to loop bdata_list
        [PATCH] mm: fix boundary checking in free_bootmem_core
make the free_bootmem_core could handle out of range case. we could use
bdata_list to make sure the range can be freed for sure.
so next time, we don't need to loop online nodes and could use
free_bootmem directly.
