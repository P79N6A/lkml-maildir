sizeof (void *) == sizeof (unsigned long) if and only if you are on a
32-bit arch, like i386.  The only place unsigned long should be used is
in arch specific code, and even then it's use should not be encouraged. 
If such code exists in the general kernel (device drivers, file systems,
etc.) then it is severely broken from a portability standpoint and will
not work on 64-bit arches.
