Ok that I'm afraid bears no resemblance to anything the software side
does (we write in chunks but we do single PIO block transfers of each
sector).

Two things
1.  Tweak the code to write 1K, fsync, write 1K fsync
2.  Repeat the above in 512 byte chunks.
That tests the way the device responds to writes. You can then try different
bigger sizes. If the 512 byte one corrupts and the 1K one doesn't that is
the only thing I can think of that would fit the pattern
