SUSE 6.0 is glibc based AFAIK.

That's why there are LSB :-) Still far from completeness though :-((

I'm have completely empty X11 three on few servers here. I am does not have
even resque floppy without libc (be it libc[45] (still GNU Libc based), glibc2
or statically linked libc in one big program on resque floppy...)

I am not port bunch of software every day but I know for sure from peoples who
do this that if you are familiar with systems then port from one glibc based
system to other glibc based system usually trivial while port prom glibc based
system to libc5 based system is just slightly less trivial then port from
HP UX to Solaris.

Such as Libc. I'm NEVER seen ANY Linux distribution without some form of libc.
ALL libc's for Linux are derived from GNU Libc (1 or 2)... For Linux developers
libc is somewhat even more important then kernel. To have minimal system you
need kernel and some shell (bash, ash, zsh, tcsh -- there are many). To compile
shell you need at least gcc (not part of system -- just a tool) and libc (part
of system in one form or other -- or as part of statically linked executable or
as real shared library). One essentional part is from Linus and other is from
GNU project. Without X11 you still have working system. Without ANY of shell
you have working system -- you need /bin/sh but it's could be bash, ash or
whatever (usually bash from GNU project is used of course). Login programs are
not needed if you have single-user system. /sbin/init is needed but again
there are few. Libc, derived from GNU Libc (be it libc4, libc5 or glibc2) is
inevitable in Linux world...

Yes, there ARE differences between glibc-based Hurd and glibc-based Linux
(thus GNU/Linux, not just GNU :-), but glibc-based Linux is close to
glibc-based Hurd then to libc5-based Linux (from application developer
viewpoint that is).
