Subject: 2.6.8 (or 7?) regression: sleep on older tibooks broken

I was previously using a stock 2.6.6 kernel without problems on my
tibook.  I upgraded to 2.6.8.1 and compiled using:
gcc (GCC) 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-6sarge1)
and "Version: 2.14.90.0.7-8" of binutils, in Debian.
I saw there is a similar problem here:
http://lists.linuxppc.org/linuxppc-dev/200407/msg00092.html
but it's not the same problem... I removed the ohci_hcd module from
the kernel (it's present at boot), and sleep still doesn't happen.  I
don't even get the "breathing" light, and yet the computer still seems
warm after some time, seemingly indicative that it's not really asleep
or dead.  I can only restart it via the Ctrl-Command-Power
combination.
Logs don't say anything.
So - what got changed that could have caused this breakage?
Kernel configs and other info available on request.
