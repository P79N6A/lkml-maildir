SHFS seems to be outdated. Checking on the web reveals the last release and 
web page update was 2.5 years ago. The source contains a license statement:
shfs/Linux-2.6/inode.c:MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
I have one tainted module (cisco_ipsec) loaded, which was not in the post 
since I did not know of the importance.
