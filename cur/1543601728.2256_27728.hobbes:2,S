Right, we probably should do that.  But consider that any time this happens a 
reverse map would have eliminated the fault because we wouldn't need to unmap 
the page until we're actually going to free it.

With rmap it's easy to do it either way: either treat the ref bits as if 
they're all or'd together or, perhaps more sensibly, age up by an amount that 
depends on the number of ref bits set, but not as much as UP_AGE * refs.
