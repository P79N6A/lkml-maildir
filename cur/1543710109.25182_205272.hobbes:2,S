module_param() is a type-safe interface roughly identical to 
MODULE_PARM().  Therefore, if MODULE_PARM() works, module_param() works 
also.

ISTR it needed some cleaning up before it could go in.
Further, in Linux, there is _never_ a requirement that "this driver be 
included before we can clean up."  You can start the re-org any time you 
wish.  Out-of-tree maintainers can follow the re-org, sometimes more easily.

P.S. I still need to look at your netlink thing.  Seems like a decent 
direction.
