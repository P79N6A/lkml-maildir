On this level we are not talking about stopping bad stuff from hitting the 
disk. There is a lot simpler scenario how that can happen and that is via 
a dropper at which point it can be detected and reported when the file is 
closed. But more importantly further access to it can be blocked until 
appropriate actions are taken which also applies with your example, no? Is 
it possible to open for execute and have dirty mappings (or open for 
write) on a file at the same time?

That is true for that scenario.
