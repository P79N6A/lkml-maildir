Hello! 
I tried to get a nice fbdev running with my card, but when I load aty_fb
from kernel 2.4.17 or 2.5.6 it just makes my screen black and forces me to
reboot so I can see anything again.
It looks like it is supported in aty/atyfb_base.c, but 
Q: Is my card supported ?
Q: Will it ever be supported ?
Here's my lspci output, so you can see what I use...
