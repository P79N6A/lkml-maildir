My conflict tolerance is already rising.  i.e. I will fix up such trivial
to fix conflicts.  I am more concerned with complexity of conflicts than
mere number (so "too many conflicts" should be read as "too many
conflicts that I can't figure out in a shortish period of time").
If it gets too bad, it falls into Linus' "the person who changes the APIs
bears the pain" basket. :-)
