Yes, it is also much simpler than my implementation (I did a similar homenode
scheduler for an 2.4 kernel). The basic principles are the same.
But the main problems I have is that the tuning for threads is very 
difficult. On AMD64 where Node equals CPU it is important
to home node balance threads too. After some experiments I settled on 
homenode assignment on the first load balance (called "lazy homenode")  
When a thread clones it initially executes on the CPU of the parent, but 
there is a window until the first load balance tick where it can allocate
memory on the wrong node.  I found a lot of code runs very badly until the 
cache decay parameter is set to 0 (no special cache affinity) to allow
quick initial migration. Migration directly on fork/clone requires a lot 
of changes and also breaks down on some benchmarks.
