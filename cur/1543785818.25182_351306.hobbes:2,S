I believe this wouldn't work. binfmt_script currently has the code
        for (cp = bprm->buf+2; (*cp == ' ') || (*cp == '\t'); cp++);
to get out the (start of the) interpreter file name. This knows
implicitly that you need to skip two bytes #!; for UTF-8 signatures,
it would be 5 bytes.
Now, if you meant to suggest that bprm->buf should be adjusted (e.g.
through 'brpm->buf += 3'): this cannot work, either. It would break
subsequent binfmt modules which assume that bprm->buf is the first
1KiB (or so) of the file to be executed.
If you suggest that the patch should merely check for the signature,
and then skip it: this is what the patch does.
Regards,
Martin
P.S. I just noticed there is a
bprm->buf[BINPRM_BUF_SIZE - 1] = '\0';
which seems incorrect: it puts a null-byte into the buffer data,
thus (slightly) corrupting the data for subsequent binfmt modules
(although it already knows the file starts with #!, so the
 subsequent modules will fail, anyway)
Also, I think the above loop should also terminate for '
 *cp == '\0'
if there is neither a space nor a tab in the file.
