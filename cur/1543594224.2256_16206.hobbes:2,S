Because this increases the code density of the common
case, getting the lock immediately.

It is a hint to the processor that we are executing a spinlock loop
(it does something wrt. keeping the cacheline of the lock in shared
state when possible).
I believe it is documented in the Pentium 4 manuals, previous chips
ignore this sequence and treat it as a pure nop from what I understand.
