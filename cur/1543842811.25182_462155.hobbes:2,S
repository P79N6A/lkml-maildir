Sure. At the beginning I have one task with one BC. Then
1. A thread is spawned and new BC is created;
2. New thread touches a new page (e.g. maps a new file) which is charged
to new BC
    (and this means that this BC's must stay in memory till page is
uncharged);
3. Thread exits after serving the request, but since it's mm is shared
with parent
    all the touched pages stay resident and, thus, the new BC is still
pinned in memory.
Steps 1-3 are done multiple times for new pages (new files).
Remember that we're discussing the case when pages are not recharged.
