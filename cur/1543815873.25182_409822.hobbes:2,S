You should rather change the message, since AFAIR from the thread
HOTPLUG_CPU is required for suspending.
Something like:
"CONFIG_X86_PC (PC-compatible) can handle up to 8 CPUs. Reconfigure and
 recompile your kernel if you intend to use more CPUs."
BTW: The help text is confusing: If (CONFIG_X86_BIGSMP)
"This option is needed for the systems that have more than 8 CPUs
 and if the system is not of any sub-arch type above.",
no option allowing more than 8 CPUs should follow, but CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH
does follow and it's suggested for that case. Maybe BIGSMP should be moved
down to the end, only CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH being below with the help text
changed to "Supports all Subarchitectures above".
