Excuse me -- I was one of the attorneys on the Novell/TRG lawsuit --
check my motions
and filings.  In fact, check the 4th District Court in general for my
filings in other cases.  You can check the Texas courts for 1980's as
well.  Just because I have been a software 
engineer for the past 20 years does not mean I did something else in a
previous life. 
Since all my friends are lawyers and TRG runs a law firm out of here
should say something.
