     You can patch (pretty cleanly) 2.2.14 to raid 0.90 support with:
ftp://ftp.fi.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/raid/raid0145-19990824-2.2.11.gz
     Corresponding (latest) raidtools v0.90 are:
ftp://ftp.fi.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/raid/raidtools-19990824-0.90.tar.gz
     I am using this combination and so far it seems stable.  I don't know
if there is any kernel support (or patches) for 0.90 in 2.3.x; I wasn't
able to find any, anyway.
