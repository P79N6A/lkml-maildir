Don't confuse architecture and implementation.  There are _some_
machines (implementations) which have legacy support.  But the
architecture is explicitly designed to allow for legacy-free machines,
as is the case for the hp zx1-based machines, for example.
It seems to me that input/misc/pcspkr.c is doing the Right Thing:
	count = 1193182 / value;
        spin_lock_irqsave(&i8253_beep_lock, flags);
        if (count) {
                /* enable counter 2 */
                outb_p(inb_p(0x61) | 3, 0x61);
                /* set command for counter 2, 2 byte write */
                outb_p(0xB6, 0x43);
                /* select desired HZ */
                outb_p(count & 0xff, 0x42);
                outb((count >> 8) & 0xff, 0x42);
so if a legacy speaker is present, it assumes a particular frequency.
In other words: it's a driver issue.  On ia64, this frequency
certainly has nothing to do with time-keeping and therefore doesn't
belong in timex.h.
