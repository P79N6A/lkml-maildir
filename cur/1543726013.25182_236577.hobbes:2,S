I don't have bitkeeper installed.  I get my patches from kernel.org, 
either from the main Linus tree, or Andrews akpm tree. Is there 
someplace where I can dl a patchkit that leads up to rc1 by the 
"daily" snapshot?  Or should I just get the 'broken out' patch after 
I verify that it also occurs with rc1 of course.  That I haven't 
done, mainly because rc2 has a lot of usb bugfixes and my mouse 
hasn't died all by itself on rc2 like it was for at least 2 dozen 
patches before rc2.  IIRC it did a time or 2 on rc1.
It takes a < 1 day for this to occur usually, but seems to occur after 
a long session of doing something else that fails. (or maybe causes 
the fail, of a make install in konstruct/meta/kde)  Thats running 
now, someplace in kdegraphics-3.2.92 from the looks of it.
I'l go see if I can get the patch in broken out form.
Mmmm, no, I guess I won't.  I've just upgraded this machine to FC2, 
and gftp is one of the many things broken by this, an strace exit of 
trying to run gftp, most recent release:
writev(2, [{"/usr/bin/gftp-gtk", 17}, {": ", 2}, {"error while loading 
shared libra"..., 36}, {": ", 2}, {"/usr/lib/libpangoxft-1.0.so.0", 
29}, {": ", 2}, {"undefined symbol: pango_fc_font_"..., 44}, {"", 0}, 
{"", 0}, {"\n", 1}], 10/usr/bin/gftp-gtk: error while loading shared 
libraries: /usr/lib/libpangoxft-1.0.so.0: undefined symbol: 
pango_fc_font_map_get_type
) = 133
exit_group(127)
And libpangoxft is this:
[root@coyote root]# locate libpangoxft-1.0.so
/usr/lib/libpangoxft-1.0.so.0.399.1
/usr/lib/libpangoxft-1.0.so
/usr/lib/libpangoxft-1.0.so.0
with the latter 2 links to the first one.
So I'd love to find this and fix it.  FC2 broke way more than it fixed 
on this machine.  And yum update did run just fine once I got some 
similar problems with libxml2 sorted.  Sorry.  Hints on this also 
gratefully accepted of course.
In the meantime I'll cp my .config back to rc1 and see it it happens 
with rc1.
