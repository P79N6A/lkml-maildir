Hi,
There's been a patch floating around for a while now to add Netmos
support to parport_serial.  It has been submitted numerous times but it
seems that nobody notices it. :)
Can it be reviewed for inclusion before 2.4.27?  I have a few systems
with these cards and it would be very nice to have them up to snuff.
The patch against 2.4.20 can be found here:
