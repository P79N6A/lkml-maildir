Page-out from end of the inactive list is not efficient, because pages
are submitted for IO in more or less random order and this results in
a lot of seeks. Test-case: replace ->writepage() with
int foofs_writepage(struct page *page)
{
        SetPageDirty(page);
        unlock_page(page);
        return 0;
}
and run
$ time cp /tmpfs/huge-data-set /foofs
File systems (and anonymous memory) want clustered write-out and VM
designs with separate write-out queue (like O(1) VM) are better suited
for this.
Nikita.
