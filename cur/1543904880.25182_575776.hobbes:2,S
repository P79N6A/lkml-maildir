I guess the proper terminology would be 266 MT/s (Mega
Transfers/second). Looking through the PSI_SIG PCI-X 2.0 marketing
blurbs, they use MHz a lot when referring to MT/S. So I would still
consider this to be a minor bug.  The user wants to know the transfer
rate, not the actual frequency of the bus.  Maybe just print out the
mode used instead, e.g., "PCI-X 266"?
