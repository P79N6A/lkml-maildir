OK - what I did:
cd /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam
rm -rf kbuild.git
git clone /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git kbuild.git
rename to .git to kbuild.git
I had to specify both GIT_DIR and GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY to make
git-prune-packed behave as expected. I assume this is normal when I
rename the .git directory like in this case.
I will se if any pullers complins (mostly/only Andrew I think).
