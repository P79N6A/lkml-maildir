This looks like characters are getting missed out, rather than
anything getting garbled.  The above characters all appear in
/etc/printcap in the order shown.  Obviously there isn't enough
redundancy in /etc/printcap for the print-out to be useful despite
that. :-)
Please try adjusting the 'udelay (1)' lines in
drivers/parport/ieee1284_ops.c:parport_ieee1284_write_compat to be
larger delays (for example, try replacing the 1s with 2s, or 5s, and
see if that makes things better).
Let me know what you need to change to get it working.
Thanks,
Tim.
