I see the same thing here on a plain vanilla CD-ROM (pardon the 
unsightly wrapping):
May 23 21:52:34 luther kernel: hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 
{ DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
May 23 21:52:34 luther kernel: hdc: packet command error: error=0x54 
{ AbortedCommand LastFailedSense=0x05 }
May 23 23:12:37 luther kernel: hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 
{ DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
May 23 23:12:37 luther kernel: hdc: packet command error: error=0x54 
{ AbortedCommand LastFailedSense=0x05 }
