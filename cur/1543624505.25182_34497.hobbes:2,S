I wrote a basic version of that (reqlog) a couple of years ago (with
the writing of the rw/block/size info inline in the kernel rather than
via a nice separate filter). The use I put it to was for migrating
block devices live (i.e. while being read/written) without having to
quiesce the readers/writers except for a few seconds at the end. The
idea is that you set up (as an ordinary userland process) a bitmap
in memory for all the blocks on the device. You start with them all
marked dirty. You then do two loops concurrently (select() or threads):
    while (1) {
        read next block/size touched
        mark corresponding bits dirty in bitmap
    }
and
    while (1) {
        while (find_next_dirty_bit_in_bitmap()) {
		mark bit clean
		read corresponding block from device
		send blocknumber, blockdata to remote peer
	}
        go back to start of bitmap
    }
The remote peer is a daemon which just reads the (blocknumber,data)
pairs and writes the data to the snapshot-to-be device at its end.
Eventually, the bitmap gets mostly clean and the migrating process
has "caught up" and is just siphoning newly dirtied data off to the
remote end in real time. At that point, you quiesce the writing
applications nicely for a few seconds (database, serving daemons or
whatever is writing to the device) and let the migrator clean the
bitmap fully (the last few blocks) and at that point you have a
point-in-time safe snapshot at the remote end.
With filters available (presumably as modules) for the bio stuff,
this will become possible without having to patch the kernel (I think
I submitted the reqlog and bufflink patches for inclusion but
didn't care enough to keep trying).
See
    
http://www.clueful.co.uk/mbeattie/linux-kernel.html#reqlog
and bmigrate and bufflink on the same page for the "old" way. It's
basic stuff and new APIs mean a rewrite will be much easier but I
thought you may be interested in another application of such logging.
