I've problems too with the Radeon frame buffer. When I type shell
commands, the screen become weird (some pixel lines seems to move, ...);
I had to use ^L very often, or less it's totally unreadable. (I'm using
-ac kernels for ext3fs).
I've a Radoen 64 DDR with an AMD 761 AGP chipset.
If someone has experimental pacthes and need beta-testing, feel free to
mail me the patch.
Thanx for your great work
