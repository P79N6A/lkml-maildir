I think both modes of operation are useful -- sometimes I want to hack
in the tree and later decide what to commit, and sometimes I know
exactly what sequence of commits I want to make and do a series of
"change-some-files then commit everything" steps.
In the latter case, it's very convenient to have commit just grab
everything and clear the slate for my next step.  Morever, I use the
latter style enough that I think even the requirement of a long option
seems annoying and artificial; a short option would be fine though...
