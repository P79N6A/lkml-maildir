well, I only had one time huge problems with a journaling FS, this was
when I thought I could use Reise FS Beta on a Production File Server ;)

well, ever had a check of several hundrets of Gigabytes in ext2 after a
poweroutage ... when you had this several times in a row, you even take
ext3 and thank for its existence ...

I'd never use ext2 on a server anymore nowadays. You have so many
choises of stable journaling filesystems, you don't have to use ext2
anymore (except perhaps for small partitions like /tmp or /boot ...)
