Look at Suspend2 then. I know you won't want it in exactly that form,
but it's there and have been tested and debugged.

You want to write the image to swap (any kind) but you need to use swap
to free up enough memory so that you can make the image and write it.
But wait, in freeing enough memory, you reduced the amount of swap
available for your image, so now you need to free more...

You're forgetting, I think, that for Suspend2, we're not usually
swapping anything out. It would only be under very unusual memory load
that we'd be swapping memory out, and that would only be after caches
were discarded, which would probably address the situation itself.
There's therefore no division of the image.
