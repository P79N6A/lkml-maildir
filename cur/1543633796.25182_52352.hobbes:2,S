Backups, that is what you need. Or a scratch machine.
This is what vanilla 2.5.21 can do to your filesystem
(after a reboot and a e2fsck -a):
% ls /lost+found
#10416
#104719
#104724
#10537
#10540
#10547
#10548
#10549
#10550
#10551
#106768
#108545
#108550
#108576
...
(thousands and thousands of files - not lost, only their
names suffered a bit...)
But, to be fair, only a small part of the damage is due
to the kernel. Afterwards, e2fsck made things much worse.

(Vanilla 2.5.21 does not compile, you say?
OK, 2.5.21 together with the addition of the #include lines
that make it compile.)
