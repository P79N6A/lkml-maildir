I've been having very similar problems with a box here.  Just put 
Gentoo on it, and started having weird errors almost immediately 
- libraries not being found, all the way to gcc being unable to 
make executables.  Occasionally, I'd get a full lock - network 
was dead from the outside, and locally everything was frozen.  
The logs pointed to the same things - 'hda: status error: 
status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest },'  'hda: 
timeout waiting for DMA' and then a 'reset: success,' but it 
didn't seem that way.  Turning off DMA didn't seem to have any 
effect on gcc problems or lockups.
The Maxtor utility said everything was ok, and I had been using 
FreeBSD on it for months with no problems there.  Heat isn't a 
problem.
I then took out SiS5513 support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIS5513), and I 
haven't had any problems since.  DMA is back on, and I've had a 
couple of timeouts and resets, but only 3 or 4 in ~10 hours, and 
no lockups or other noticeable weirdness.
Kernel version is gentoo-sources 2.4.20-r7, but I think that has 
patches from >=2.4.21.  I haven't tried any other sources.
Drive is a Maxtor 8 Gig, 90871U2.
Board is a PCChips M571.
