The other solution for avoiding problems if a specific SCSI drive fails
to spin up is to use entries in /etc/fstab of the following form:
LABEL=tmp              /tmp                     ext2    defaults 1 2
UUID=3a30d6b4-08a5-11d3-91c3-e1fc5550af17  /usr ext2    defaults 1 2
The latest mount supports this, as does the very latest e2fsprogs
release (1.15, just released this week; see the e2fsprogs page at
http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/linux/e2fsprogs.html
).
