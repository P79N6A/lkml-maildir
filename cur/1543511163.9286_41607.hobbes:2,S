Well the real way to get more speed may actually be to change the
driver to do memory mapped I/O instead of I/O ports I/O - Ingo did
some simple benches of that a few months ago, show that reading MMIO
is like 5 times faster than inb() and writing is almost 10 times
faster.

No idea, dodgy hardware, bad tranceivers?
