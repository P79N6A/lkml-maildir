Ok, the diffs from -rc3 are minimal, most noticeably the (very _very_ hard
to trigger, but nasty if you ever did) fork() race that Ingo found.
I'm going to be in Australia (and on airplanes) for the week, but we're
all in the capable hands of Andrew, so why worry? The fact that I'm
fleeing the country should in no way be construed as anything sinister at
all, no siree. Nope. I'm innocent, and nobody saw me do it. 
The full changelog is getting uploaded right now along with the release, 
and the BK trees have already been pushed. 
Up up and away,
		Linus
