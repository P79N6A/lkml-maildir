well, just as background info, this is the wrapper around
a single assembly instruction which calls system firmware and takes
9 CPU registers for input and 9 CPU registers for output parameters.
This definition by platform architecture won't change in the near future,
but the good news is with Antons change the wrapper will look much nicer.
