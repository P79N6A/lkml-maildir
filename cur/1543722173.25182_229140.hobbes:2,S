Well, I don't see much added overhead, (save memory).  We already dispatch 
interrupts via indirect function calls in irq.c.  And the core clock functions 
(used by gettimeofday, for example) are also indirected today (this to allow 
pm-timer, TSC, or PIT at boot time).  All we would do is put both of our 
possibilities in the list.  The only place we add overhead is in an indirect to 
the "proper" hardware timer for the sub-jiffie interrupt.
