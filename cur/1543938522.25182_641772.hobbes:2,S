I'm seeing similar, I would not rule out that this is actual scheduler behavior ;(
at least it seems consistent.
I also made a patch (to lkml yesterday) that counts the total and count of scheduler latencies
to also show the cumulative effect of these latencies

that's weird; there's nothing blocking in the entire patch at all.
(the only lock is a spinlock)
The performance aspect... collecting the data isn't cheap (which is why it's made a sysctl),
I still plan to look at optimizing it but it won't ever be free.

afaik yes.

note that the percentages are percentage this entry had compared the total sum of latencies.
The maximum entry is only loosely related to that; say you have 1 latency in "foo" for 100ms
but 900 of 1ms in "bar", "foo" will show 10% and "bar" will show 90%

it's not costly to calculate, it's the screen space versus the value of the information :(

still working on that; you can pass the --unknown option to dump these so that I can add them
to the translation table.
