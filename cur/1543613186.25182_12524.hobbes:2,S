Subject: NFS woes in 2.5.1-pre8

I'm not sure if this is expected or not, but I'm seeing odd behaviour with
NFS on 2.5.1-pre8:
[root@assabet bin]$vdir ../lib
-rwxr-xr-x    1       51       51   29091 Dec 12  2001 libts-0.0.so.0.0.0
../lib: Input/output error
[root@assabet bin]$uname -a
Linux assabet 2.5.1-pre8 #69 Mon Dec 10 22:21:15 GMT 2001 armv4l unknown
[root@assabet bin]$
Looking at the NFS traffic:
16:27:09.051301 assabet.arm.linux.org.uk.33f11c24 > raistlin.arm.linux.org.uk.nfs: 148 lookup fh Unknown/1 "libts-0.0.so.0" (DF)
16:27:09.061306 raistlin.arm.linux.org.uk.nfs > assabet.arm.linux.org.uk.33f11c24: reply ok 128 lookup fh Unknown/1 (DF)
Admittedly raistlin is running a rather old, obsolete NFS server, which has
up until now worked faultlessly for around 2 years: Universal NFS Server
2.2beta48
Appologies, but I'm not sure how I got it into this state either - last
thing I had done was to overwrite the files in ../lib and bin with new sets
on the NFS server.  The only directory that is suffering is ../lib.
(there's bin and ../include as well, both of which would've had their
files overwritten with later versions).
