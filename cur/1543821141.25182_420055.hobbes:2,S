So what do you propose should be done to better handle such poorly
built machines?
As a concrete example I have a notebook which definitely assigns
shared interrupts to IRQ-10 (See /proc/interrupts below) yet the ELCR
only flags IRQ-11 as being level triggered and the rest are edge
triggered.
And with this configuration I definitely lose interrupts to the
wireless ethernet (ra0).
How do I make this work reliably?
I could:
1/ modify handle_IRQ_event so that it is more resilient to the
  possibility that shared interrupts are edge triggered.  This can be
  done be iterating over all action->handlers until they all return
  IRQ_NONE.
2/ Arrange that the ELCR bit is set for any IRQ for which a shared
  interrupt is registered (on the basis that the code for handling
  shared interrupts is not resilient against them being edge triggered).
3/ Have a kernel parameter, or sysfs variable, or magic
  write-to-/proc/interrupts of something that allows the ELCR to be read
  and set, and leave it up to user-space to perform the risky task of
  fiddling with ELCR
4/ As userspace can do inb/outb itself simply leave it all to
  userspace to worry about.
5/ Something I haven't thought of.
I don't much care which (those 2 seems best based on my limited
understanding) but I would be good to know how you think this should
be handled so that progress can be made.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
