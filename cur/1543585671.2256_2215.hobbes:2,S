Yep, almost certainly the same, or at least very similar Xircom card.

OK, can you try this patch?  It's very simple, and is probably not the
correct fix (the correct fix is probably to add the Xircom card to the
supported PCI table), but it works for me.  I'm not sure why the generic pci
serial code counts the number of iomem regions and only uses it if it has
exactly 0 or 1, but the Xircom has 2 iomem regions so the generic code fails
to use it.  The following change relaxes the generic code to allow for up to
2 iomem regions on a PCI serial device.  I have no idea what the side
effects would be to this change, but it makes my Xircom work again and that
was my goal.  If I can help someone fix this correctly let me know what you
need.
Later,
Tom
