do you want me to install windows and have a look at my register settings on a working setup? since my problem might be a different one, i just want to make sure that its neccessary that i install windows ... i'd have to back up a lot of stuff, so it would take some time...

The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live,
mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time,
the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn,
burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across
the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and
everybody goes "Awww!"
