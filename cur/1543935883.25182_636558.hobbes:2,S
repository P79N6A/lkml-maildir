Earlier we would have had a problem, since we even accounted for swap
cache with PAGE_CGROUP_FLAG_CACHE and I think page_file_cache() does
not account swap cache pages with page_file_cache(). Our accounting
is based on mapped vs unmapped whereas the new code from Rik accounts
file vs anonymous. I suspect we could live a little while longer
with PAGE_CGROUP_FLAG_CACHE and then if we do not need it at all,
we can mark it down for removal. What do you think?
