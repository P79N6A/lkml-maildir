I guess we could do that (now or later).
For now how about something minimal like the change below?
Sam, does this seem OK to you?  (The situation is that the IPATH_CORE
source physically sits in drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath, but it is
possible to enable IPATH_CORE without enabling INFINIBAND.  So we need
to tell the build system to descend into drivers/infiniband if
IPATH_CORE is enabled, even if INFINIBAND isn't enabled)
Thanks,
  Roland
