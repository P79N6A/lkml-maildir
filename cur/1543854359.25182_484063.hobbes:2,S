Hi,
I don't know what sort of debugging needs you have, exactly, but I
would suggest you take a look at User Mode Linux (UML). UML provides a
safe and pretty easy way to start you with kernel debugging and just
looking into kernel internals. It is a virtual kernel running in user
space, so it doesn't require a separate test machine, and you can
debug it with normal gdb. Furthermore, it is included in current
vanilla kernels, so you can get started without any extra patches.
Main sources for information concerning UML are:
