No, it's comparing the current lib/sha1.c to the optimized code in the 
patch.  I was just pointing out that the unrolled code you were likely 
testing against, back then, may not have been very good.  (Though I 
assumed that you were talking about the unrolled code in random.c, not 
the code in CryptoAPI, so that might change the numbers some.  It 
appears from the post you linked below that the unrolled CryptoAPI code 
still beat the rolled version?)

About 3700 bytes for the 32-bit version of sha_transform().

I'm not in front of that machine right now; I can check tomorrow.  For 
what it's worth, I've seen equivalent performance (a few MB/s) on a 
range of fairly-recent kernels.
