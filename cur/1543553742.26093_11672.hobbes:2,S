I'm not following your argument very well.  I've read it
and reread it several times.
Does adding a call to usb_init() in init/main.c cause
USB to be init 2 times?
I'm not complaining or arguing against you, just
trying to understand better.

There were several threads but I can't find the
"original" one right now.  IIRC, it was simply that
CONFIG_USB=y and CONFIG_USB_*=m (any USB except usbcore
built as modules) caused depmod problems, but that could
be incorrect also.
