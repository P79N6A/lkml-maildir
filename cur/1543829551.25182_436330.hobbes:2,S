NACK.  You should use ioctl_by_bdev and fix it to fake up the file pointer
instead.  That keeps faking the file pointer in a single place and solves
the problem of NULL file pointers for other cases like the s390 partitioning
code, or various odd filesystems figuring out partition tables by themselves.
For bonus points use a common helper for both blkdev_get and ioctl_by_bdev
that creates the fake struct file.
