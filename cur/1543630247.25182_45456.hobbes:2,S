Are you sure you were using this exact .config without the
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y in 2.4.18 vanilla? The problem is that recent
Dell laptops with local APICs are known to have buggy BIOSen
that cause exactly the kinds of problems you described (hangs
at BIOS and power-management events).
2.4.19-pre8 has the necessary workarounds for Dell Inspiron
and Latitude laptops. Alternatively, rebuild your kernel with
SMP, UP_APIC, and UP_IOAPIC all disabled.
(If your Dell is old enough to not have a local APIC, then this
is not the problem and you can ignore this message.)
