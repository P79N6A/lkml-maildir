With this you're adding again all the device naming linux has got ridden of
by removing devfs (it rememebers me to solaris' devfs: They have a
sysfs-like filesystem, except that things in /dev are a symbolic link to a
device file in /devices)

If your intention is just to boot kernels and not run userspace on them,
then sure, it's a good idea to get rid of /dev.
