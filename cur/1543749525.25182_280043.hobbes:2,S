Subject: [patch 2.6.10-rc3] handle bridged platform bus segments
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

There's an inappropriate assumption that platform_bus
has only one top-level segment; trivially fixed.
- Dave
During setup to access platform bus segments through bridges, the current
platform_device_register() ignores the resource parent specified by the
bridge.  That means it'll always detect a (false) resource conflict with
the bridge, and fail the resource reservation step.
This patch makes that code use the specified parent resource, defaulting
to "iomem_resource" or "ioport_resource" only for a NULL parent (that is,
for devices that aren't accessed through a bridge).
