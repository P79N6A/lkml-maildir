A separate thread happened to start up on lkml.org, shortly after
yours, that went into this in considerable detail.
For example, the interaction of cpusets, sched_load_balance,
sched_domains and real time scheduling is examined in some detail on
this thread.  Everyone participating on that thread learned something
(we all came into it with less than a full picture of what's there.)
I would encourage you to read it closely.  For example, the scheduler
code should not be trying to access per-cpuset attributes such as
the sched_load_balance flag (you are correct that this would be
difficult to do because of the locking; however by design, that is
not to be done.)
This thread begins at:
    scheduler scalability - cgroups, cpusets and load-balancing
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/29/60
Too bad we didn't think to include you in the CC list of that
thread from the beginning.
