No, it's not an x86 binary, it's in the firmware of the drive:
Execute Extended Self Test
smartctl -x /dev/hda?
so if you can send a S.M.A.R.T. command, you can run the test.

No, I don't think that you can expect drive manufacturers to replace a disc that you haven't taken care of, especially if it has been used as a football, (isn't that against FIFA regulations, though?  Especially in the world cup example given earlier in this thread.  I thought the specs of the football were quite strict).
