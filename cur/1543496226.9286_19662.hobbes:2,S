1 GB memory means 256.000 spinlocks. I think that's overkill regardless
of the number of CPU's.
What about 
- 1 spinlock: simple.
OR:
- a hash-table with (NR_CPU*16) spinlocks? 
This would limit the memory usage, scale quite well.
The only possible problem is cache line contention, but even
__cache_aligned would still save lots of memory.
BTW, I think I found a major SMP-race, I've posted it to
linux-kernel@vger.
Since your buffer code fixes parts of that problem, I've attached my
mail.

__global_cli() cannot stop the other processors if it is called with
interrupts disabled.

I've added a check for that event (__global_cli() called with IF
cleared), and this happens often.
Do we have to fix that? (i.e. convert the callers from __global_cli() to
a spinlock?)
I've found one codpath:
-> ide_end_request(): acquires io_request_lock, clear local interrupts.
-> calls end_that_request_first()
-> calls end_buffer_io_async() <<<<<<<<<< calls cli(), needs global
sync.
