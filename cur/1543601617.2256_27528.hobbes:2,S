fsync_dev() is not needed for raw devices or swap.  It _is_ needed for
file access.

Sorry, it just sounded so..., well, familiar... Couldn't resist ;-) (BTW,
Richard, _what_ political whatever could be found in that?)

Andrea, had you seen the off-list mail (cc: to you and Linus)?  The main
problem I have right now is that I don't see how you manage to guarantee
that during the last ->release() no requests are going in.  Old code
did unconditional invalidate_buffers() to wipe out all buffer_heads when
device is finally closed.  Absense of pagecache sources was guaranteed
by umount() - by the time when we release ->s_bdev all pages are gone.
How do you deal with that in the current code?
