usbfs could copy the user buffer to a bunch of non-contiguous pages, and
then fire those off in an urb using the scatter-gather stuff.  [Rather than,
as now, allocating a bunch of contiguous pages using kmalloc].  That would
probably make it possible to use much much bigger user-space buffers.  Plus
the code looks rather easy to write.
Ciao,
Duncan.
