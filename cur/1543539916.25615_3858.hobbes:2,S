Think of it as object oriented design. The filesystem-specific part is  
exactly equivalent to deriving a filesystem specific class from a generic  
class which may add a few instance variables.
That's *why* it works well. If other unions can be made to work the same  
way, they, too, will work well -- if not, not.
Basically, unions only really work well for stuff that an OO language does  
with subclasses. They *can* be made to work for other stuff, but that can  
get ugly fast - there's some situations where you just have no good  
choice, but avoid it where you can.

Not necessarily. That is, if you need that if statement *anyway*, then  
it's typically ok (for the same reason it's ok in the class-like context -  
basically, you only ever want to access unionized fields from code that's  
naturally specific to this union variant), but if you need it only to  
access the union, then you lose.
The problem with the if variant is that it's quite a bit harder to make  
certain you are in the good situation.
A case that works would be if you get commands from the network, and the  
command determines the union variant (which holds the parameters). You  
branch on the command (need to do that anyway) and then take the  
parameters for that command.
If there's something you need to do for all (or even many) commands,  
though, you pray that it's not inside the union.

... except in well-understood situations. That means no "these probably  
won't be needed at the same time, but I didn't bother to look at all the  
source".
