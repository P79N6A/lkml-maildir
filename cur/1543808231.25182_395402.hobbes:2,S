To which bugs are you referring? Looking at the bugs for the cdrtools
package, I only see 1 functionality bug. All of the rest are policy
violations, copyright updates, translation updates, etc. And ironically
in that 1 real bug the entire thread degenerated into you pointing
fingers and slinging mud at the Linux kernel maintainers again, just
like this one.
Jim.
