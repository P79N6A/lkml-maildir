We're talking about what to offer userspace now...  I think we all
agree that the kernel itself shouldn't be allowed to hit it, one way
or another.

Especially now that GCC has intrinsics for prefetches, and GCC's
optimiser can generate prefetches automatically (-fprefetch-loop-arrays).
But if they assume the kernel hides it, they'll still hit it on any of
the huge installed base of <=4 year old AMD boxes running 2.2 and 2.4.
Ideally, userspace should just not compile with prefetch if they think
they might run on one of those - or select different code at run time
- it is not so different from the constraints which say SSE code
simply won't run on some CPUs or old kernels anyway.  (prefetch is
worse on a P5 than a K7 - it'll throw an illegal opcode exception :)
I understand you're advocating a policy that says we can't do anything
about old systems, but from 2.6 onwards apps can depend on not being
hit by that erratum in userspace, is that right?
