I greatly prefer function pointers to [possibly] generic obj management
code, to storing object sizes.  Some filesystem is inevitably going to
want to do something even more clever with inode allocation.  My method
gives developers the freedom to experiement with inode alloc to their
heart's desires, without affecting any other filesystem.
