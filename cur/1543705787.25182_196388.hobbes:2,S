Hi:
Since Andrew Morton picked up latest acpi bk updates, nforce motherboards have problems, mainly with ethernet adapters. Reporters say that with acpi=off, the problm gets fixed, so we think the problem could be acpi. Some more useful info:

My e100 on an nforce2 won't work in rc3-mm1.
The "acpi=off" boot parameter makes it go.
And for the record, I can boot with that kernel and save one dmesg for you if you want. Only send me a request and I'll send it to you.
P.S.: Sent any messages you want directly to me as i'm not subscribed to acpi-devel.
Thanks,
