Apart from the sync, it shouldn't trigger any fs activity.  Still, some other
task running concurrently with the suspend code may do that and _if_
we are going to allow that to happen (and we do, if we remove the freezer
from the suspend code path), we will have to take that into consideration.

No.  In addition, the devices should be prevented from generating interrupts
or initiating DMA transfers and put into low power states before we actually
suspend the system (platform).  This is a bit difficult to do while all user
space is running.

Right, but the subsystems may do something that affects devices.
