Good eyes - I only analysed the ctype.h thing, and didn't look up errno.h
in the original sources. errno.h has a _big_ comment saying where the
numbers came from (and some swearwords about POSIX ;)
Looking at signal.h, those numbers also seem to largely match minix. Which
makes sense - I actually had access to them.  
In both cases it's only the numbers that got copied, though. And not all
of them either - for some reason I tried to make the signal numbers match
(probably lazyness - not so much that I cared about the numbers
themselves, but about the list of signal names), but for example the
SA_xxxx macros - in the very same file - bear no relation to the minix
ones.
