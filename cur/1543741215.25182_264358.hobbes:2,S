Hi,
My boss wanted to have the filesystem on which our proprietery software is 
installed to be encrypted to make copying more difficult. And it does just 
that. It's not impossible to hack into the system.
This here patch will make the kernel use a default passphrase (compiled into 
the kernel or cryptoloop.ko module) when you set up a cryptoloop device with:
losetup -e aes -p 0 /dev/loop0 /path/to/your/encrypted-filesystem </dev/null
The passphrase can of course be read from the bzImage with dd if=bzImage 
ibs=<compressed image offset> skip=1 | gunzip -c | strings - | less
But all that takes some searching. And the passphrase is also XOR-ed with the 
first 32 bytes of /dev/nvram. If it is compiled as a module, the passphrase 
is even easier to read.
The added configuration option depends on CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP  and 
CONFIG_NVRAM.
The chances of breaking anything else when the option is not activated looks 
like exactly zero to me.
But I have been known to be wrong. From time to time.
The affected files are: drivers/block/Kconfig and drivers/block/cryptoloop.c
The kernel source version is linux-2.6.9 (vanilla).
Comments/improvements are welcome. My /dev/null device will be happy to 
process your flames.
