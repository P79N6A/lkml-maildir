The changes to kernel/fork.c from 2.4.4-pre1 to 2.4.4-pre3 (and in
2.4.4) cause the RedHat 6.2 linuxconf utility to fail with the message
"broken pipe".  The linuxconf utility will run the first time, but all
subsequent runs give the "broken pipe" error.  The error message is
generated as a result of a fflush command in linuxconf.  I can provide
more information upon request.
