Hi-
 This is just a message to mention that xntp is losing sync again with
the 2.2.14 release kernel.

 This occurs several times a day.
 I remember several messages on this list reporting this problem under
2.2.13, and the early 2.2.14-prex kernels.  It appeared to be be 'fixed'
in 2.2.14-pre17/18, but the patch seems to have been missed in the final
2.2.14 sources.
System is based on RH6.0, 2.2.14 w/ CONFIG_RTC=y.  
K6-2, with RTL8139 NIC .
Thanks-
ron
