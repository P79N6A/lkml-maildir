A small minor optimization in kmem_cache_estimate() slab.c
The patch below saves some CPU cycles, especially when the value of size
is small. This is against 2.4.2-2.

instead of looping through to get the right value, we make a guess
(mathematically) and move a bit to get the correct value.
Hey, I remember reading the Newton-Raphson method in school.
I verified the number of objects per slab is the same in both cases.
This patch may not improve the performance of your CPU by a great amount,
but when there is a faster way to do things, why live with the slower one.
NOTE: The code hardly does one loop in both the while statements.
