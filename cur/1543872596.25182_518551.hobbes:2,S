I never complained about one timer per fd (although, now that you
mention it, that would get a bit excessive if you have thousands of
outstanding timers).

IOW, the timerfd patch is not suitable for inclusion as-is. (While
you're at it, you should probably add a flags argument for future
expansion.)

That's what the sigevent structure is for -- to describe how events
should be signaled to userspace, whether by signal delivery, thread
creation, or queuing to event completion ports. If if you think
extending it would be bad, I can show you the line in POSIX where it
encourages the contrary.

If Linux were to do a wholesale theft of the Solaris interface (warts
and all), you'd be portable (and, now that I think of it, more
efficient).
Two major unixes using the same interface would probably make it a
shoe-in for the next POSIX, too. (c.f. openat(2) and friends)
