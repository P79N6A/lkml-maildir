Not in a suspend/resume capable notebook, though.
I don't know of *any* notebook drives that take longer
than perhaps five seconds to spin-up and accept commands.
Such a slow drive wouldn't really be tolerated by end-users,
which is why they don't exist.
But I suppose people will want to suspend/resume bigger machines
too, in which case a 10000rpm Raptor might need 15 seconds or so.
We could bump up the existing timeout, I suppose.
Perhaps Jeff could comment on any potential harm in libata
for going all the way to 3100000 with the timeout?
Cheers
