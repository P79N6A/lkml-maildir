Kernel 2.3.15
include/linux/pci.h no longer defines "rom_address" in the structure
"pci_dev".  Some device drivers are still dependent it though;
./drivers/net/de4x5.c
./drivers/net/fc/iph5526.c
./drivers/block/aec6210.c
./drivers/block/hpt34x.c
./drivers/block/hpt366.c
./drivers/block/pdc202xx.c
./drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c
./arch/sparc64/kernel/psycho.c
Presumably the drivers need to be updated.
