Just to give a little bit more information about the previously attached 
code, it is merely a module that does two things:  (a) demonstrates 
proper [and sometimes faster-than-current-linus] ATA bus probing, and 
(b) demonstrates generic registration and initialization of ATA devices 
and channels.  All other tasks can be left to "personality" (a.k.a. 
class) drivers, such as 'disk', 'cdrom', 'floppy', ... types.
