Aha, another.  You're the fourth or fifth person with this problem.  I
have a patch very similar to yours.  What my patch does is only clear
bit 7, which is what was experimentally determined to disable the Write
Memory Queue.  So far it seems that only KM133 (KT133 w/onboard S3
Savage) are afflicted.
However, the patch isn't being accepted until an explanation from VIA is
obtained (apparently the head kernel honcho's were explicitly told to
clear bit 5).  I'm working on that now.
