Ultimately no, it's not.  However, we are now late in the -rc2 time frame and
the release of -rc3 seems to be imminent.  At this point, IMO, that's the
safest thing to do.  BTW, appended is the patch I'd like to get applied.

I think we should fix the ones we know about and try to reintroduce this
change in the 2.6.26 time frame.  It also seems reasonable to reconsider what
we want to achieve, as there may be a better way to do that.

Yes, that should be possible, but as I said above, I think it's not the right
time for doing that right now.

I agree that the in_suspend_context() test may be useful and this is one
of the reasons why I think the entire approach requires reconsideration.

Me neither, and that alone is a good enough reason for resigning from acquiring
device semaphores in the suspend core, at least in the mainline kernel, until
we understand the problem.

Yes, that's strange.

Yes.

That's almost certain to me.

Yes, but our taking of device semaphores exposes these problems in a rather
drastic fashion. :-)
Thanks,
