Sure.
Note that we went through this process (of unifying dma_mapping_ops) 
recently on x86 recently - 32-bit and 64-bit x86 had such differences.
Note that the main complication wasnt even the small variations in 
signatures, but the different _semantics_: one dma_mapping_ops 
implementation passed in kernel-virtual addresses, the other physical 
addresses. Unifying that was invasive and non-trivial, and it can break 
stuff not at the build level but at the runtime level. We can expect 
similar complications when done over 20 architectures as well.
But yes, it's all desired. Obviously extending swiotlb to highmem and 
using it on xen and powerpc is an essential first step in the direction of 
generalizing all this code.
