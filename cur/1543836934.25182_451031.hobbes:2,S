This patch looks fairly scary.  It's protecting the device private
data, you're removing the locking from some accesses and leaving it
(albeit with irqs off now) on others.  It seems to me that can't be
right.  It's either always there, or always not.
You observe that open and close are protected by rtnl_lock.  I observe
that uml_net_change_mtu and uml_net_set_mac are as well, in dev_ioctl.
The spinlock protecting this has to be _irqsave because the interrupt
routine takes it, to protect against receiving packets on an interface
that's being closed.  If that's impossible, we should prove that, and
remove the locking from uml_net_interrupt.
I can't decide about uml_net_start_xmit - there's some RCU stuff
around one call that leads to it, but I don't see any sign of
rtnl_lock.
So, I'd say there are some changes needed here, but they're not
entirely the ones in this patch.
