Greetings;
I'm still trying to make sensors (and gkrellm) work when booted to a  
2.6.x kernel.
The lm_sensors people say it should "just work", but so far no one has 
acknowledged that it doesn't work here because I don't have an "i2c" 
in my /proc/bus directory.  Browsing all the sensors-detection stuff, 
in particular the bus detection script, this thing is hard coded to 
look for /proc/bus/i2c by default, or you can pass it an argument.
I don't have a "/proc/bus/i2c".  Passing this script the /sys/bus/i2c 
argument only gets an error return complaining that its a directory.
I can't see the forest for all the trees here, so where do I stand and 
start swinging my chainsaw?

Cheers, Gene
