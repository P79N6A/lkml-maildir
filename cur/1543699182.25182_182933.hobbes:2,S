Humm, I've got a bt878 tv card thats rather noisey when eeprom inits.
This sounds like a change in the order the kernel inits this stuff 
might be in order but I've NDI howto go about that...  According to 
dmesg, all that bttv stuff is found about 1000 lines before the first 
mention of i2c...  I assume that means I'd have to modularize the 
bttv stuffs too so the init order can be conmtrolled?
If I make all that into modules, do you have a working modules.conf I 
can obtain so that this stuff is brought in in the proper order?
I tried it without the VIA686, didn't see anything missing that wasn't 
before, then found I had both VIA and VIAPRO set=y. I don't have a 
VIA 586 chipset, so I turned that off and its remaking now for 
effects.  Somehow I think its gonna be a wasted reboot from what you 
are telling me.
Thanks a bunch for any further assistance you can render.
