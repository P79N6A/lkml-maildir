But prelink only allocates in the area below executable if
/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield exist (and only for i386; there is also
--exec-shield/--no-exec-shield to override).
Really the most safe way for Wine is to create a PT_LOAD segment with
p_flags 0 covering the whole area below the executable.  The kernel first
maps the executable, then the dynamic linker, so no matter what address
are ld.so and shared libraries prelinked to, they will not be mapped to the
area Wine reserves.
Unfortunately, there is no easy way in ld to create the segment ATM,
see 
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2003-12/msg00211.html
In current binutils, perhaps creating a special linker script from the
default on the fly and assigning segments there could work, but maybe
far easier would be to just create one allocated PT_LOAD segment somewhere
and using libelf change it's location and p_flags.
Making Wine a PIE is also a possible solution (at least in FC2 for
non-prelinked PIEs kernel doesn't honor ld.so's prelinked address), but
then you cannot be sure the kernel doesn't choose the addresses Wine wishes
to reserve while randomizing.
