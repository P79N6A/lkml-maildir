	How oops is reached:
	2 CPUs enter fib_select_multipath while fib_power is 1.
Both see 1 at 'if (fi->fib_power <= 0) {', so no 777, CPU1 changes
fib_power from 1 to 0 before CPU2 reaches 'w = jiffies % fi->fib_power;'
	How 888 is printed:
both CPUs see 1 in 'w = jiffies % fi->fib_power;' but the first
changes nh_power and fib_power from 1 to 0. CPU2 sees 0 everywhere
and prints 888. I assume nobody plays with DEAD.
	If I understand correctly the locking (please correct me),
we can have many threads at the same time:
- many in ip_route_* calling fib_select_multipath
- one in rtnetlink playing with nh_*
