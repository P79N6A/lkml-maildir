I haven't found much information on the raw ATAPI command
interface provided in Linux 2.6, but from what I can tell
it can understand the sg3 interface.
However, I can't open the device read-write, so mmap'd IO
is impossible, and unless it's currently horribly insecure,
I can't write CDs anyway.
I was just wondering what the desired behavior is, if there's
a different style interface I'm supposed to use, etc.
