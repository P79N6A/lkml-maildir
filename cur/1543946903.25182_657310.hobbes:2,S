My funny custom device requires 100us or so.  Unfortunately atmel_spi
can not use such a slow bitrate.

Yes, it would be an another way to achieve it.  But as long as zero
length transfer is legal on this API, I don't want to add other
fields.

Yes.  I tested it on AT91SAM9260 and it seems ENDRX rises soon.
Though it can be possible to avoid starting DMA for zero length
transfer, I think it is not worth to optimize for such a rare case.
