You asked me to go through your fixes and at times were quite rude about
demanding they were applied. The Zmagic problems come from your set of patches
you wanted to apply to 2.2.13
I attach your message to linux kernel on 11/Oct/1999. Please attach an
apology by return of email
I will assume that you want no other of these patches in 2.2.14
Alan
