Start digging through the patch queue. Plenty more to come,
but I want to do this in chunks rather than one huge set.
As usual,..
Patch against 2.5.20 vanilla is available from:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.5/
Merged patch archive: 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/patches/merged/
Check 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/Linux-2.5.html
 before reporting
known bugs that are also in mainline.
