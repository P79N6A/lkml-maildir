If Selective self-test is pending on power-up, resume after 0 minute delay.
i have already filed a support request to Western Digital. but i doubt they will know this certain issue
and won't have a fixed firmware for me.
in AHCI mode this error makes the system freeze completly after a few hours without further
log entries. in IDE mode it keeps working the bad way without making the system freeze.
anyway no more time to risk a broken filesystem. i'll change my setup. but if you have an
idea how to fix it or want me to test something just drop me a mail. thanks so far.
