I don't know what is exactly hardware protocol. I am just going by 
intel documentation. 
Remote IRR—RO. This bit is used for level triggered interrupts. Its meaning
is undefined for edge triggered interrupts. For level triggered interrupts,
this bit is set to 1 when local APIC(s) accept the level interrupt sent by
the IOAPIC. The Remote IRR bit is set to 0 when an EOI message with a matching
interrupt vector is received from a local APIC.
According to this, IRR bit is set to one only when Local APIC accepts the
level trigger interrupt. This implies there should be a way of IOAPIC 
knowing that destination local apic has accepted the interrupt.
Anyway, I think after disabling the LAPIC, it should not accept more
interrupt from IOAPIC. It will only deliver pending interrupts to CPU
if CPU has not masked it. So in your case it looks like we have got
pending interrupts at LAPIC which never received EOI in first kernel.
Second kernel will field these interrupts and will mark as spurious
interrupt and issue EOI. But by that time IOAPIC  does not have vector
info so will not clear IRR bit.

So you tried issuing EOI to all the pending interrupts in first
kernel. Did you check that at the time of issuing EOI, corresponding
vector bits were set in ISR/IRR at LAPIC and IRR was set at IOAPIC?
If yes, then only some hardware guy can tell us that why issuing an EOI
did not clear the IRR bit at IOAPIC.
I have never used a trace analyzer. Can you really parse the EOI message
and see what are the contents? I mean in terms of making sure right
vector info is there so that IOAPIC can reset IRR?

Sorry, you are right. I read the code too fast. IOAPIC entries will be
cleared and precisely that seems to be the reason why issuing an EOI
in second kernel will not help this situation in its current form.

Isn't the "nobody cared for irq x" situation similar. Some device has
asserted a level triggered interrupt and there is no respective device
driver. So kernel sees a flurry of interrupts. (issues and EOI but
immediately sees next interrupt as device has not de-asserted the interrupt
line)?

This will be interesting. So you are saying that there are cases where
IRR bit is set at IOAPIC but corresponding IRR/ISR bit is not set at
LAPIC? If that is the case then even enabling the interrupts will not
help? Because IRR/ISR bit is not set, CPU will never receive an interrupt
and it will never issue an EOI for that vector? I am not sure in such cases
how will your patch solve the issue.
I think we should not be enabling the interrupt after the crash. If needed,
we should just issue the EOI and it should work. Otherwise we need to get
in touch with hardware folks to tell us what is going on.
