	It is 1024.
	Why should it be anything in particular ?
	It being 1024 gives nice properties in certain obscure
	internal time functions.  100 or 1000 can not use same
	tricks as 1024 when a division is needed...
	The 100 is usual UNIX tradition, although other values
	were present in earlier times.   Alpha on the other
	hand has always been a rather fast beast, and there
	a faster timer tick is somewhat justified.
	That 100 is tough for a 386/20MHz, but 1024 is no problem
	for a Pentium-IV/1.5GHz.
