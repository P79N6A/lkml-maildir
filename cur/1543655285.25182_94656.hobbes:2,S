One interesting thing about my current setup, with all scsi or FC disks,
is that bomb never displays > 0. 
Example: 
elvtune /dev/sdn yields:
/dev/sdn elevator ID            17
        read_latency:           8192
        write_latency:          16384
        max_bomb_segments:      0
elvtune -b 6 /dev/sdn yields:
/dev/sdn elevator ID            17
        read_latency:           8192
        write_latency:          16384
        max_bomb_segments:      0
Is it because I just do volume management at the hardware level and use
whole disks? Or is that something else?
