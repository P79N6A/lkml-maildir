Maybe you shouldn't consider the powerfailure as a happening at one
single point in time, but rather happening during a short periode of
time. Maybe it is possible during this periode of time, that at some
times there is enough power for actually writing to the disk, and at
other times there is not.
I think it should be possible for the firmware on a good disk to
prevent such artifacts. But I think you can find disks that just
keeps trying to write even while power is failing.
