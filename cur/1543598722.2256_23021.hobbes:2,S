Well, maybe I am completely off the road, but the primary problem seems to be that a whole lot of the pages _look_ like being of the same age, and the algorithm cannot cope with that very well. There is obviously no way out of this problem for the code, and thats basically why it fails to alloc pages with this warning message. So the primary goal should be to refine the algorithm and give it a way to _know_ a way out, and not to _guess_ ("maybe we got some free pages later") or _give up_ on the problem. How about the following (ridiculously simple) approach:
every alloc'ed page gets a "timestamp". If an alloc-request reaches the current "dead point" it simply throws out the oldest x pages of the lowest aging level reachable. This is sort of a garbage-collection idea. It sounds not very fast indeed, but it sounds working, does it?
Best of all, very few changes have to be made to make it work.
Shoot me for this :-)
Regards, Stephan
PS: timestamp could be a simple static int, that is counted up on every successful alloc. Obviously page needs an additional struct member.
