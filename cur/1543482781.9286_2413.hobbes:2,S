that's really broken. You must uncomment the second outw, too. Otherwise 
the second outw goes to a randmon register of the PCnet. But I don't
see, why port autoconfig doesn't work for you, either. It works on all the
boards (even AT1500) I've used the lance driver.

It's a host bridge, but it should be called ghost bridge instead ;^)
