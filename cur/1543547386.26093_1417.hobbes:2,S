Obscure? Look: all locking order rules in two lines -
	All ->i_sem ones go before all ->i_zombie ones.
	Within the same group order is just by memory address.
You claim that you have something easier to understand? triple_down() is a
_sort_ on 3 elements, for fsck sake. Conceptually very simple.

Look, could you call it d_set_state(dentry, busy) or something? It would
really help reading the thing.

Show me your rmdir() and lookup(), will you?

Are 'moving' dentries busy? From the code below it seems that they are
not, so you are wide-open to e.g. file creation in the target (originally
- empty directory).

Huh? See - here's a problem with your approach: can you tell in one
sentence what the piece above does? It's _not_ a nitpick. Debugging such
stuff really requires the ability to say concisely WTF it is supposed to
achieve.

Broken. rename() must be atomic.

OK, just for starters, what happens if two rename() are trying to move the
thing into different places? Both succeeding? What happens if the target
(originally empty) gets a new child? Prevent that in fs? Fine, but then
you've just moved locking of inode pairs (if not triples) into _every_ fs
out there.

Besides, I'm yet to see a deadlock scenario with userland filesystem that
would go anywhere near the directory operations. So I'm not sure what you
are trying to fix here.

Sorry. I think that you are missing a detail: your variant will need a
_lot_ of cruft in every fs. And I think that asking to show a proof-of-concept
_full_ thing for some filesystems is not unreasonable. Just to estimate
the amounts of the cruft.

Not. You've suddenly got a need to deal with a lot of _new_ locking in
filesystems. All of them. Please, show the AFFS patch, just to demonstrate 
how to deal with them. "Let fs maintainers deal with it" is _not_ a valid
answer. At least describe what is needed and show how to fix the in-tree
instances. You'll have to fix them if that proposal will get to something
workable. I'm not asking for complete patch right now, but IMO at least
one fs must be done _and_ tested. Just to let everyone estimate the
results.

Where? You've skipped the most interesting part: check for rename()
validity. And yes, it will take some locking in your variant.
Look: more states for dentry are needed. No arguments here. I could
probably even save you some time just digging out the proposal and
pre-patches around the same idea. However:
	* your "ordering" snippet in rename() (if I've parsed you right
and that's what you are trying to do there) is _way_ more complex than
double_down() and even triple_down(). Why? Because there you can trace all
possible paths of execution - there's finite amount. All you need is to
show that sorting is right. I claim that your retry scheme is inherently
harder to proof. And unlike the situation in ext2_get_block() (that made
you retch, IIRC) there's no obvious invariants.
	* you've completely missed all fun problems with creation of
children in the object we are renaming over. It will come back to haunt
you in every local fs that has ->rename().
	* fs locking becomes much more of a burden. I don't see how it's a
good thing. Right now one can write a filesystem and ignore the directory
races completely, unless he is has operations with side effects on other
directories. With your own proposal for extent flipping (horrible, IMO) it
would become a non-issue even on AFFS and I'm yet to see any other
example. And yes, AFFS can be done simpler than your variant. Complex
issues didn't become simpler. Simple ones became complex. VFS also grew
and became more complex. That might be justified if it bought us
simplification in filesystems, but it didn't. Notice that you can (right
now) drop and reacquire the locks if you want to be smart, so it didn't
buy you even better threading.
	I don't understand your reaction to ordering, BTW - if you have a
class of locks used only in one place it's not a problem. Overdoing the
amount of locks is seriously bad idea, but you didn't decrease it.
_Sharing_ locking mechanisms between different subsystems is very bad, but
having a semaphore in private part of struct inode? Makes sense to me.
Look: our inodes are strange beasts and there really should be no union
(inode->u). There is VFS inode (called vnode in SunOS-derived designs) and
there is an fs inode. The latter happens to be kept together with vnode
for several filesystems. Hystorical reasons... It doesn't change the
nature of the beast - you want fs-private, you look into fs-private part.
There are 3 objects, not 2 - dentry->vnode->inode. The latter is optional
_and_ fs-only.
	BTW, your design doesn't exclude deadlocks, even if you manage to
lock (as in "down()/up()") only one dentry at time. You can deadlock on
the dentry state, busy looping. And the fact that you've got more states
just makes analysis harder...
