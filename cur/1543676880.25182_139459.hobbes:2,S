What does hashed state have to ->d_parent?

b) is bogus.  Unhashing does nothing to ->d_parent.

Two different dentries for the same file is obviously not a problem...

... and AFAICS it opens a huge can of worms with races in NFS unlink/rename.
Sigh...  I'll look through that code and try to reconstruct the analysis.
It used to be a very big mess and there was fairly subtle logics around
unhashing/checks for d_count/etc. involved in fixing ;-/  And there was
a lot of changes since then.  Oh, well...
