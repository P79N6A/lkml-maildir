Yeah, we hit this with iscsi_tcp. iscsi_tcp does not suport clustering, 
not due to a HW limit, but becuase that is just how it was implemented. 
When we get clustered segments we end up with data corruption or an oops 
depending on the operation. I think the workaround was to set the 
default segment for sg and st to a page or just use the block layer sg_io.

ok, I can implement clustering for iscsi_tcp. For now it does not much 
matter since we never supported large sg or st commands.
