What should also be considered here is that we may want to have
different numbers of queues per subsystem (fewer for those where
probing is resource-heavy), but may want to restrict the total number
of queues as well. Some throttling mechanism may be helpful here (so
that a single subsystem cannot hog all queues while another is stuck
with a single queue, or double usage of queues). In fact, throttling
may be interesting for any subsystem using parallelism, especially if
the number of devices may be huge and/or probing resource hungry.
