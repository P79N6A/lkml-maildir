Subject: [BUG] 2.5.71: no cursor until tty output

There appears to be a bug in fbcon where the soft cursor does not appear
on the screen until some tty output occurs.  I suspect soft cursor is
missing some initialisation somewhere; I have once seen some random garbage
flashing on the screen instead of the cursor, which seems to be where
the cursor is supposed to be.
When tty output occurs, the characters appear where the garbage was, and
the normal cursor appears.
I've noticed this on several fbcon drivers, so I don't believe it is a
generic fbcon bug.
