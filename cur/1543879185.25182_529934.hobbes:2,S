OK, so I resurrected x86_64-mm-sched-clock-share.patch and
x86_64-mm-sched-clock64.patch.  The x86_64 box hangs on boot when using
netconsole and printk timestamps too.  Removing "time" from the kernel boot
command line prevents that.
This explains why the hang only happens with
x86_64-mm-log-reason-why-tsc-was-marked-unstable.patch applied, too: that
patch must be triggering a printk inside xtime_lock.
Does someone want to cook up a lockless printk_clock() for i386 and x86_64?
