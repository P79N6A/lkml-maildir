1000 sounds like a course number. A good estimate for the user setting
these limits would be percentage or better yet let the user decide on the
parts. For example, the user could divide the available CPU's capacity
to 2000 parts and ask for 200 parts or divide into 100 parts and as for 10
parts. The default capacity can be 100 or 1000 parts. May be the part
setting could be a system tunable.
I would also prefer making the capacity defined as the a specified portion
of the capacity of all CPU's. This would make the behaviour more predictable.
Consider a task "T" which has 10 percent of a single CPU's capacity as hard
limit. If it migrated to another CPU, would the new CPU also make 10% of its
capacity available "T".
What is the interval over which the 10% is tracked? Does the task that crosses
its hard limit get killed? If not, When does a task which has exceeded its
hard-limit get a new lease of another 10% to use?
I guess I should move on to reading the code for this feature now :-)
