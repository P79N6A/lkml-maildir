FYI, that particular problem will disappear with the 2.5 Makefiles.
The zero length .o files will still exist but the post-compile
dependency data (.o.d) will not exist so a subsequent make kernel will
rebuild the incomplete objects.  This is a general workaround for
incomplete kernel objects, independent of the file system type.
