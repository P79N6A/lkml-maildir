I didn't have anything to do with it, but this description is correct
(if a bit confusing).  I think that you should explicitly say (assuming
that Paolo does not have any objections):
PTRACE_SYSEMU only makes sense at a call's exit, not at entry.
PTRACE_SYSEMU is only practical if you want to emulate all of a
process's system calls (as is done in UML), because you can not examine
the process's registers before making the decision to emulate a call.
