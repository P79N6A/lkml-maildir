This one happens quite often to me, but the server machine is not Linux
at all (an SVR4 UNIX);
When it happens, it looks like that:
I have just finished an ssh connection from my workstation to the server;
I start a new ssh connection to the same server and it appears to hang;
netstat -a on the server shows that a connection from my workstation from
  port x is still not quite finished;
Linux on my workstation probably thinks that it is over, to is allocates
 the same port x to SSH (or let SSH allocate, I am not quite sure)
The new ssh connection is reported by netstat -a on my local workstation
 as being in SYN_SENT state;
I think when it happens to you again you might want to run netstat -a
on the server and your workstation and check whether the symptoms are 
similar.
