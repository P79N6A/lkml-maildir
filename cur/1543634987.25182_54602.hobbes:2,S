I got my server stop responding and after reboot I checked the logs and got a lots of kernel bugs. ProFTPD was also involved in that. httpd (Apache 1.3.26) also gave some stack output. Correct me if I am wrong. I have attached the file for detailed analysis. Please check it and let me know about the possible bug/solution.
The log shows no sign of any ext3 problem.  I can't see anything in it
which would justify trying to send a compressed log of nearly 400kB to
an ext3 general users mailing list.
For what it's worth, your dcache oopses are most often associated with
bad memory --- try memtest86 on that machine before you go any
further.
