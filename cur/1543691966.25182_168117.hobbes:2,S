Heh, so are the pci ids in that link too :)

Either is fine with me.

I agree.  That's why topology is only one part of the rules, and is so
low in the chain of hierarchy of what to match on.  To recap, here is
the hierarchy:
	1 - label or serial number
	2 - bus device number
	3 - topology on bus
	4 - replace name
	5 - kernel name
So, if you do not have something that matches for your device for rules
1 or 2, then use 3.  But yes, it can change.  So can any of these items,
that's why we have to be flexible.
And yes, we should add wild card matching for topology rules, it's on
the todo list, I haven't had much time to work on udev lately.

Ok, do you have any other ideas of how to do this?
And patches for udev are always welcome :)
