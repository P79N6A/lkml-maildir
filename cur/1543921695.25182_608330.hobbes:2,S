Today I was able to boot from an FC disk with a modified kernel 2.6.21
without any initrd. The modification was basically to replace the contents
of drivers/scsi/qla2xxx with the code in qla2xxx-v8.02.02-dist.tgz from
ftp://ftp.qlogic.com/outgoing/linux/beta/8.x/
 as that driver has the
firmware built in.

In this case I finally did prefer a solution which didn't depend on any
separate firmware file. Being able to boot straight to the FC drive
without the need of initrd was really nice.
When I first asked my question I assumed that I would have to compile the
driver as a module and use an initrd containing both the module and the
firmware together with userspace mechanisms to load the firmware. This
solution with a replaced qla2xxx driver was not the answer to my first
question about bool and tristate, but that question also got answered in
this thread.
Best regards Henrik
