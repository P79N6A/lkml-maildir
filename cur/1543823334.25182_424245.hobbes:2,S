Let's dive into it.  How do you get the randomization without 
sacrificing syscall performance?  Do you randomize on boot, dynamically, 
or on a per-process level?  Because I can see some issues with 
per-process randomization that will certainly cost some amount of cycles 
on the system call path.  Marginal perhaps, but that is exactly where 
you don't want to shed cycles unnecessarily, and the complexity of the 
whole thing will go up quite a bit I think.
