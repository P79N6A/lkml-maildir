section Current State
  IPv4 TCP and UDP (rx only) sockets.
It is simply too early for sexy discussions. For me, the most appealing part 
of AIO is the socket handling. It seems a little bit broken in the current 
glibc emulation/implementation.
Recv and send operations are ordered when used on the same socket handle.
Thus a recv must be finished before a subsequent send will happen.
Good idea for files, bad for sockets.
SGI's implementation kaio, which works perfect for me, is widespread ignored 
and sufferes from the unreserved syscall problem like Ben's aio. I am sure 
there is a reason for ignoring SGI-kaio, i just do not remember.
With the current state of the different implementations it is difficult to 
have sex about or use them.
But i would really like tooooooooooooooooooo.

The one-sig-perfd patch did not get much attention either.
No one seems to use sockets these days.
