A good question ... I'm going to put John's change in as-is for now so
that 2.6.15 can benefit from the reduced code size of the out-of-line
and avoid the ugly bug when preemption is enabled on a drifty system.
We can make fine tune changes to the udelay() implementation after we
get some data on what is needed.

As we reduce the non-preemtible window drift in my version of udelay()
would get worse ... but I haven't done any measurements on how much worse.

Bad news if your ar.itc wraps around (less than four centuries of uptime
at 1.6GHz :-)
