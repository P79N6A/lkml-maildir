Some code below there is suspicious.  Maybe you could modify
some of it...
(cut-and-paste, may have whitespace damage:)
		if (!check_mask || sysrq_enabled == 1 ||
		    (sysrq_enabled & op_p->enable_mask)) {
			printk ("%s\n", op_p->action_msg);
			console_loglevel = orig_log_level;
			op_p->handler(key, pt_regs, tty);
		}
swap those last 2 lines and see what happens...
