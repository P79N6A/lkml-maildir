I believe he did make the distinction there. He states "The abstraction (SG_IO 
on an open special file) is in the kernel." An "open special file" could be 
anything, but in this case it's meant to refer to a /dev/ entry. The point he 
made is valid, and it appears that in this case, Joerg, you are the one who 
is "technically uninformed".
