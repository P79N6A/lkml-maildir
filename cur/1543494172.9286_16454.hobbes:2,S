Subject: [CFT] FAT patch v15 (beta)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/4/29/88

News:
	Rediffed to 2.2.7. Lots of generic stuff went into -pre4, so it
became somewhat smaller. Minor bug in UMSDOS_put_inode() fixed.
 	Patch lives on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/fat-patch-15.gz
   							Cheers,
   								Al
