How about splitting the credentials out of the task_struct and making
them sharable ala ->mm et al?  You change uid there and it changes for
everyone.  It will make fork slightly more expensive though.

Heh, I'm somewhat less ignorant of ptrace, so I'll see if I can help
out there.

Yeah, I realize that, but have no idea how much code that requires
looking at.

Ah, I somehow missed this.  Since you seem to have explored that area
of the solution space already and found it wanting, I agree that it
makes sense to see if syslets can be made to work.
