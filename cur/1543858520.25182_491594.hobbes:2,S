The RTC module knows how to shut the interrupt up.
(And in many cases, timers are special. Timers, by design, are often "edge 
triggered" even in systems that have no other interrupts that work that 
way. Exactly because a timer is special. So the RTC module often knows 
that it doesn't need to do anything at all to shut it up, but even that 
is special per-device knowledge, that is NOT TRUE for any normal devices).
