	I would suggest that you will *compile* those packages
	yourself (modutils, util-linux), even though at first
	you should upgrade to the lattest version of glibc 2.0.7.
	The lack of '__bzero' is a sign of oddish libraries at
	package builder's system.  Either due to some odd intrinsic
	in the used gcc, or some other surprise.
	Installing  util-linux-2.9.8, and then trying
		ldd /bin/login
	will soon tell, which libc version is called for, and
	possibly also tell, if there is the problem...
	On the other hand, I am running 2.2.0 system with util-linux-2.8.
	(Although with glibc 2.1 ..)
