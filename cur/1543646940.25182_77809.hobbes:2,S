Its as easy as: If you want to distribute the binaries, you have to
distribute the source freely. If you don't want to distribute the
binaries nor the code and keep your project private, you don't have to,
under the GPL.
Regarding binary-only kernel modules - well, it's possible, but don't do
that.
