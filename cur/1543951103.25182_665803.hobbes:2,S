The ftp directory contains the SCSI patchkit (which I have been
posting to linux-scsi for quite some time, but it didn't get applied
yet) and the block patchkit (which hit linux-kernel earlier,
but was unfortunately not graced by a reply by the block maintainer so far)

Best you test all together. The subsets are independent
(as in kernel should work with any subset of them), but 
they all clean up DMA memory related issues.
