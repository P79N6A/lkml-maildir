Well, here's what I've done. I've made a change in video/vesafb.c to 
change __init vesafb_init to only allocate the amount of memory required 
  for the requested framebuffer (I think). So far, it appears to work 
fine. I haven't tried many modes yet, but it's worked with what I've 
thrown at it. Thanks again,
The trivial change I made was changing this:
video_size	= screen_info.lfb_size * 65536;
to this:
video_size	= screen_info.lfb_width * screen_info.lfb_height * video_bpp;
