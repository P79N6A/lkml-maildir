I don't think you do.

Maybe those StrongARM chips don't exhibit the write buffer bug?  Remember,
I said _SOME_ StrongARM-110 chips exhibit the problem.  I did not say
_ALL_ StrongARM-110 chips exhibit the problem.

Well, as far as I'm concerned, I completely believe that I have explained
it entirely, and I still don't know why you're trying to make this more
difficult than it factually is.

Well, once you collect the kernel information and forward it to me, I
can have a look.
