Indeed.
The way I do it is:
 (1) The daemon opens /dev/cachefiles to being an instance of a cache.
 (2) The daemon negotiates a security context for the module to use.
 (3) The security context is place in a task_security structure.
 (4) This task_security struct is attached temporarily to task->act_as each
     time any task attempts to access the cache through the module.
 (5) The task_security struct is discarded when the file descriptor that was
     created in (1) is closed and the cache is withdrawn at the same time.
