Okay, I fscked all filesystems in single user mode, thereby fscked up my 
root filesystem, though I didn't even check it - so I restored it from 
backup (grub wouldn't even load anymore).
After 2 days in my freshly setup debian (2.6.1-bk6), same error. But 
this time at least I know it's because I tried to delete those files in 
the lost+found directory...
So, how do I delete these and why did fsck fail? It's pretty annoying to 
reboot because of this. It would be nice to just being able to 
remount,rw the partition.
Thanks,
Jan
