Something looks very wrong here.  You listed the devices to --create
in one order:
   a b c d
but that appear in the array in a different order
   b c a d
Did you cut/paste the command line into the mail, or did you retype
it?  If you retyped it, could you have got it wrong?
You need the order that --detail shows to match the order of the
original array....
