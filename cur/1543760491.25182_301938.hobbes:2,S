Not really `lots of complicated stuff'.  Just swap a timer and set a
flag on entry:
    msp->timers[msp->laststate] += now - msp->lastchange
    msp->lastchange = now
    msp->laststate = ONCPU_SYS
    msp->cflags |= MSA_SYS
And swap timers and clear the flag on exit.  The flag's needed to
force return to ONCPU_SYS rather than ONCPU_USR if the task preempted or
interrupted while in a system call.
If there's a simpler, cheaper, faster way to track time spent in
system calls (as opposed to time spent in interrupt handlers, or on
the run queue)  thn I'd like to know what it is.
And I recognise there're are lots of people who don't want this ---
but there are some who do.  I've maintained this patch since mid 2003,
and have seen a steady trickle of downloads --- one or two a week.
