Subject: [PATCH] Move cgroups destroy() callbacks to cgroup_diput()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/23/123

Move the calls to the cgroup subsystem destroy() methods from
cgroup_rmdir() to cgroup_diput(). This allows control file reads and
writes to access their subsystem state without having to be concerned
with locking against cgroup destruction - the control file dentry will
keep the cgroup and its subsystem state objects alive until the file
is closed.
The documentation is updated to reflect the changed semantics of
destroy(); additionally the locking comments for destroy() and some
other methods were clarified and decrustified.
