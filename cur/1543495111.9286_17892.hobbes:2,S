thats one of the tough things IMO ... without those constraints we could
easily get rid of the linear behavior in the scheduler. We are trying to
avoid situations where there are lots of tasks on the runqueue _and_ there
are lots of reschedules happening, this way linearity doesnt matter.

do you still see responsiveness problems under pre4-2.2.8? If yes then i'd
be very interested in reproducing it.

this can be achieved by increasing (or changing) the scale of priorities. 
(this can be done seemlessly) But i doubt this matters in most cases.
(except when there are _lots_ of niced 100%-CPU using processes running)
