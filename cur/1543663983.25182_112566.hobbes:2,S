So you want to transfer the complete zImage, including the redundant
configuration and system.map to the target over the network, only to
have it thrown away?
Guess what?  I netboot ARM boxes as well.  I cope.  It's easy.  You
change /boot/ to be $TARGET (eg, /var/boot/kernels/), which is where
you put your netboot kernel image today.
If you have more than one kernel build, then put it in
TARGET=/var/boot/kernels/<machine-name>/
Or, in the case of a NFS root setup, you place all the files in the
boot directory of the NFS root image for the target system.  This way,
the target gets the correct System.map, again with no extra hastles.
I do all of the above (minus the .config.)  It works.  Nice.  Simple.
No hastle.
