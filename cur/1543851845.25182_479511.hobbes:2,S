The scheduling while atomic part looks familiar, the rest not so.
Worth giving it a shot though...
On my machine it was the keventd workqueue that got messed up.
I have some patches that:
 - add debug_show_held_locks(current) to might_sleep() and schedule()
 - check in_atomic() and lockdep_depth after each workqueue function
   and print the last function executed
 - name some 'old_style_spin_init' locks
I'll post those patches after a cleanup...
