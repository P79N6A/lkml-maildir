Do check your /proc/interrupts though.  With my P4P800 I found
that when set to Enhanced mode, and when ide-scsi was carefully
avoided, I was still getting a storm of interrupts that were
doing rather bad things for system performance.  Can you check if
you are also seeing the same thing?  i.e. does the interrupt line
with your ide controller(s) on it show bazillions of interrupts?
