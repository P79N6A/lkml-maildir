Fair enough.  Since I don't really have any cases I can think of that
require this sort of behavior, I'll back off on allowing user mounts
with suid or sgid enabled.

Do folks think that the limits should be per-user or per-process for
user-mounts, what about separate limits for # of private namespaces
and # of mounts?
The fstab support doesn't seem to provide enough flexibility for
certain situations, say I want to support mounting any remote file
system, as long as its in the user's private hierarchy?   What if I
want user's to be able to mount FUSE, v9fs, etc. user-space file
systems, but only in a private namespace and only in their private
hierarchy?  Or are these situations which you think should "always be
okay" as long as nosuid and nogid (and newns?) are implicit?
