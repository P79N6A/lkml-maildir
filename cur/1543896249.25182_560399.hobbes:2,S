Put another way: we lived without DEBUG_RODATA for fifteen years, why 
should we now start adding complexity to work around code that doesn't 
accept the (fairly small) debugging it gives?
Has anybody actually found a bug using it?
As far as I know, the biggest reason to use DEBUG_RODATA is
 (a) Hey, it's a cheap way to check one thing
 (b) An added layer of security (which it's not that great for, but it 
     might make sense to make it more of a real security feature).
and neither of them really seems to say "let's add more code to other 
pieces of the kernel to work around it" to me.
