It's fairly new. I heartily encourage initcalls, they are _much_ nicer
than explicit initialization. The explicit way only makes sense for (a)
old drivers and (b) code that requires certain ordering.
However, instead of using "__initcall" directly, I would suggest using
"module_init()" and "module_exit()". Which will do the right things for
drivers whether that driver is compiled as a module or not (basically, a
good driver these days should have NO code that is inside #ifdef MODULE
any more).
