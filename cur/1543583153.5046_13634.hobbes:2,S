	Hi,
	I have a problem with my filesystem, the kernel panics
	as soon as it tries to mount the root filesystem.
	I guess it is because of the IDE bug in the driver
	Russell found, but he (Russell) suggest me to post
	my message here.
	What I've tried up to now:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	% e2fsck -B 4096 /dev/<part>
	% e2fsck -B 8192 /dev/<part>
	... (16384, 32768, etc.)
	% e2fsck -b 4097 /dev/<part>
	% e2fsck -b 8193 /dev/<part>
	... (16385, 32769, etc.)
	The error message I got:
	(no matter the argument)
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
e2fsck 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
e2fsck: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/hda6
	My (formerly) system:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	o   Kernel Version:  2.4.0
	o   Hard Disk:       IBM DTTA-351010 (mode=AUTO in the BIOS)
	o   Architechture:   i386
	Is there anything I can do in order to recover my
	corrupted partition?
	Am I doing something wrong?
	Thanks a lot in advance.
	Regards,
	                                  Eduardo.
