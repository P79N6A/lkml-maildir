After lilo, the kernel is uncompressed, then the screen goes black.
the traditional init message is not even displayed
( INIT version 2.85 booting ).
It accepts Ctrl+Alt+Suppr for reboot. but that's it.
I checked that CONFIG_VT, CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE are set in my .config.
I suspect the initrd image is not loaded correctly, but I don't have any
real clue. It was generated with mkinitrd version 3.4.43.
Any Idea of what it might be ?
please cc me.
