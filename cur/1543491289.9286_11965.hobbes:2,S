Hi,
There are two things available:
1. IKD (very nice combination of various kernel hacking things including
tracing, memory leak detection, xkdebug etc). Drawbacks: breakpoints and
single-stepping not 100% reliable. Maintained by Andrea Arcangeli.
Available on 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/patch-ikd-arca/
(last time I checked it was for 2.2.4, no 2.2.5 yet).
2. remote debugging over serial console (maintained by dave@gcom.com as a
separate package gdbstubs on ftp.gcom.com but I made it available as a
patch on 
http://www.aivazian.demon.co.uk/patches
). Latest version is
suitable for 2.2.4. If people ask (and even if not) I will make
2.2.5-suitable version patch soon (tonight maybe).
Regards,
