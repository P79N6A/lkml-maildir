Why? It shouldn't take much more effort than the effort currently
being taken to maintain the MAINTAINERS file as it is. This field can
even be considered optional - i.e. let the maintainers themselves who
usually send patches to MAINTAINERS just to update their mailing
address add this field _only if they want to_.
Heck, this way it would even help us to see which maintainers are
more attentive :)

And:
c) The script will need to query vger for each file in the patch
via some protocol..
Do you think it's worth the effort?
