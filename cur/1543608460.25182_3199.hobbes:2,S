I think I see a potential problem (I'm looking at 2.4.10) in fs/namei.c.
If path_init() returns 0 in __user_walk() then err is not set to anything
(it defaults to 0)
int __user_walk(const char *name, unsigned flags, struct nameidata *nd)
{
        char *tmp;
        int err;
        tmp = getname(name);
        err = PTR_ERR(tmp);
        if (!IS_ERR(tmp)) {
                err = 0;
                if (path_init(tmp, flags, nd))
                        err = path_walk(tmp, nd);
                putname(tmp);
        }
        return err;
}
