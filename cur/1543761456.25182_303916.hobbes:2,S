Hi guys, I was looking at the load_elf_library function (fs/binfmt_elf.c) 
in 2.6.10, and noticed the following:
 	elf_phdata = (struct elf_phdr *) kmalloc(j, GFP_KERNEL);
 	...
 	while (elf_phdata->p_type != PT_LOAD) elf_phdata++;
 	...
 	kfree(elf_phdata);
Could this be problematic since the pointer being freed might be different 
from that returned from kmalloc?
