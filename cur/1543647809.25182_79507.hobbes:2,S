I'd imagine the reboot notifier chain is going away - especially as
stuff would need to be shut down in the right order, which is one of
the reasons we have the device model.  It already knows the right
order.

x86, I believe, is one example of such a platform that can leave PCI
devices jabbering over a warm reboot.

I'd think the sane solution would be a device_reboot() call, and kill
off the reboot notifier.  That's just my opinion though, given that I
have some devices that definitely need this type of treatment.
I'd rather have one registration system for this type of device
management, not multiple random lists to register stuff with all over
the place.
