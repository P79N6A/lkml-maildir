In light of all the comments, and:
1) the fact that the drivers for the e100 in the 2.4.30 kernel 
distribution work well.
2) other pci drivers work well with this port (usb/ohci, net/8139too).
3) the properties of the write back buffer are not well documented.
I am going to take a more detailed look at trying to fix this problem in 
a less intrusive manner.
