How does the kernel know the pages aren't there? I thought for a while
yesterday that I'd just misread something, but as I look at this again
this morning, I'm not so sure. For what you're talking about to work,
you'd need to mess with the page tables so that the kernel doesn't think
those pages are still there.
I can understand how you'd remember what pages to fault in, but getting
the kernel to know they're not there sounds like a rewrite of kswapd.
