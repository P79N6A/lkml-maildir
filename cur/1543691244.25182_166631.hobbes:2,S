With 2.6.0-test5-mm2, 
- 4/4bios don't do anything
- 3 will stop tasks... I got a "<6>Strange, ircd not stopped" once, and
  I removed my wifi card and it was good. (Yes, ircd was listening on
  it.)
  But after all of this hubbub it still won't come back to life. :(
I will try the other stuff later, I'm short of time these days.
Thanks for your help so far.
