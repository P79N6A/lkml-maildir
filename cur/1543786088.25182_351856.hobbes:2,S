Hmm. I don't understand the argument line completely. 
1. The kernel has to provide ugly mechanisms because a lot of
applications implementations are doing the Wrong Thing ?
2. All gettimeofday implementations I have looked at do a lot of math
anyway, so its definitely more interesting to look at those oddities
rather than discussing a single add. John Stulz timeofday rework have a
clean solution for this - please do not argue about the div64 in his
original patches which he is reworking at the moment.

Which ones ? How is this achieved with respect to all the time adjust,
correction... code ?
