Thanks Paul!  Good catch.
Kai is currently the one beating this patch into shape: he's the
Makefile guru, I just twiddle with modules.  I'm waiting for him and
Andrew Morton to merge with Linus to see what's left to apply.

You shouldn't need modversions.h any more: you can simply excise it.
This means that such a module will taint a modversioned kernel,
though.
The correct (and future-proof) way to build external modules is to use
the kernel makefiles themselves:

Hope that helps!
Rusty.
