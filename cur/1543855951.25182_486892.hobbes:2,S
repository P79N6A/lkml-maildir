This is what is currently being done by cpufreq:
a) get_some_cpu_hotplug_protection() [use either some global mechanism 
					or a persubsystem mutex]
b) actual_freq_change_driver_function(mask) 
/* You can check out cpufreq_p4_target() in
 * arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/p4-clockmod.c
 */
  
   {
	for_each_cpu_mask(i, mask) {
		cpumask_t this_cpu = cpumask_of_cpu(i);
         	set_cpus_allowed(current, this_cpu);
		function_to_change_frequency();
							
	}
  }
c) release_whatever_cpu_hotplug_protection()

Isn't the above same as what you are suggesting? Or have I missed out
anything?
