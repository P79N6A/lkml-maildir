Subject: [OT] Open-Source-Friendly Graphics:  Online petition
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I hope no one minds me posting this, but one of the members of the Open 
Graphics mailing list put a petition online where people have been 
voting on their opinions for price, etc.
The Open Graphics main page is:
http://lists.duskglow.com/mailman/listinfo/open-graphics
And the petition can be found at:
http://www.petitiononline.com/3dc4rdlb/petition.html
I think this poll may be quite revealing as to the proportion of people 
who would be interested in this product.  Given the proportion of people 
who would pay $100 and those who would pay $200, if the price fell 
somewhere between them, I'd say it's more than feasible.
So for those who thought the project died... think again.  :)
