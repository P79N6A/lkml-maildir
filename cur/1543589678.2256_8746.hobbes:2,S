This isn't really a kernel question. I think you'd better ask it on some
linux network list/newsgroup. But here's an answer anyway....
You could add 1.1.1.160 to eth0:
   ip addr add 1.1.1.160 dev eth0
and then use NAT to redirect these to the webserver:
   iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dst 1.1.1.160 -i eth1 -j
DNAT --to-destination 192.168.200.2
This should work, AFAIK, but i didn't try it myself. You could also try to
use the arp command (see 'man arp'), but i don't know exactly how that
works.
Good luck!
Michel Wilson.
