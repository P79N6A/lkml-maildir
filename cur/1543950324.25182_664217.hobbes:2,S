 From within the kernel itself?  The kernel should not be keeping track
of the mode of devices, that's what the filesystem holding /dev is for.
Those modes change all the time depending on the device plugged in, and
the user using the "console".  Why should the kernel need to worry about
any of this?

What is /cont/ for?

How is this done?
Why would the kernel care about this stuff?
