Ok, still hoping to attract the help from some more experienced in SCSI
and more knowledgable about this specific driver, here's one more thing I
can suggest - can you enable debugging through the respective /proc-files
(see, e.g., drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/Documentation.txt in 2.4). I guess,
useful would be tiny,result,queue. Possibly, for both drivers, but be
prepared - for the working one it'll produce lots of output, I guess...
Thanks
