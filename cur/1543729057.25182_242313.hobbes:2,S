I have the same problem.
I found out that cdrecord has a empty Line for the supported modes.
( not k3b fault )
cdrecord -checkdrive with kernel 2.6.7 (vanilla) gives:
Supported modes: TAO PACKET SAO SAO/R96P SAO/R96R RAW/R16 RAW/R96P RAW/R96R
with kernel 2.6.8 :
Supported modes:      ( the rest is blank )
Trying to burn anyway leads to "not supported mode" messages.
my system: Athlon on nforce2 board, LITE-ON brenner LTR-52327S, gcc 3.4.1
