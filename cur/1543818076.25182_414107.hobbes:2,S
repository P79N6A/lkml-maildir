Agreed.  smpnice is geared toward load_balancing (which indicates an imbalance 
already exists).  In order to achieve "system wide strict realtime priority 
scheduling" we need to avoid that priority imbalance altogether.

I agree that SCHED_RR doesn't need to be included here.  I'm not sure about 
another scheduling policy though.  As you said, the existing mechanism is 
inactive with nr_rt_tasks <= NR_CPUS, applications using more than that (with 
SCHED_FIFO) will likely want the rt_overload feature - as you said, it's 
about predictability and determinism.  As it is now we are using POSIX 
standard scheduling policies - do we want to add a non standard one?  I don't 
see the benefit.

Just so I am clear, is the goal then to achieve "system wide strict realtime 
priority scheduling", as opposed to a best effort?  I think this makes the 
most sense and it seems to me that the rt_overload mechanism is intended for 
just that.
