The proper fix is for those drivers to use the low level nvram access
functions and have those always built in on pmac, the config option
beeing only useful for the char device wrapper...
Anyway, pmac stuff in 2.5 is about to be significantly changed once
I'm done with the move to the new driver model, hopefully, I'll fix
those things along.
