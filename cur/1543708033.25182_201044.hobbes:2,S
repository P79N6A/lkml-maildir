Subject: /proc/kmsg  blocks with O_NONBLOCK, read() should return 0 with EAGAIN

/proc/kmsg  blocks with O_NONBLOCK, read() should return 0 with EAGAIN
	fd = open( "/proc/kmsg", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK );
	...
	poll() -- says read it
	len = read(fd,buff,len); // first read is fine
	...
	len = read(fd,buff,len); // second read blocks
I call read() a second time, because I'm feeling lucky,
(this is library code, which also reads from sockets).
I expected it to return 0 with errno==EAGAIN.
Instead it waits:  do_syslog(2,buf,count); 
I'm not on this list, so please raise a ticket, linux-2.4.23,
   thanks
