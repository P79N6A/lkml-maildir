But it does, sd understands these just fine (see references to
blk_pc_request()).
It could be coming from someone doing a blkdev_issue_flush, that will
even cause sd to queue such a request internally. So it isn't
necessarily from user space (it would have to be through SG_IO at that
point), and Reubens boot log doesn't have any evidence of anything of
that nature being started. So I'm guessing it's the flush, raid1
propagates these flushes to the bottom devices when it sees one.
Your analysis looks correct though, Reuben looking forward to hearing
whether this fixes your boot hang!
