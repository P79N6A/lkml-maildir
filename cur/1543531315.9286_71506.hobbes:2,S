Ahhh...  This is the correct way to go about it.  Please forgive my
earlier brain fart about bypassing init routines under certain
circumstances: I knew it was ugly and pretty much knew it was
wrong.
Hmmm...  Given the possibility that there is no new link order
that is correct for all reasonable sound driver configurations,
is there any way to adjust the link order on the fly based on the
sound driver configuration?  The rules should be easy enough to
come up with.  Examples: everything's modular --> don't care,
PAS16 and YM3812 built-in --> put pas2 ahead of opl3, etc.
