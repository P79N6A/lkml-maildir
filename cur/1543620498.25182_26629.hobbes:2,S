I don't see any strong reason for taking i_sem in the generic seek
functions.  The only thing we seem to need to protect in there
is the non-atomic access to 64-bit i_size on 32-bit platforms,
for which a spinlock is appropriate.
I'd be interested in hearing more details on the regression which
Ingo has seen due to the introduction of i_sem locking in llseek.
Not just for "I told you so" value, but for the body of knowledge :)
