Sorry, no.  You have to call fluch_dcache_page() in two situations --
when the kernel is going to read some data that userspace wrote, *and*
when userspace is going to read some data that the kernel wrote.  From a
quick look at the patch, this seems to be the second case.  The kernel
wrote data to a pagecache page, and userspace should be able to read it.
To understand why this is necessary, consider a processor which is
virtually indexed and has a writeback cache.  The kernel writes to a
page, then a user process reads from the same page through a different
address.  The cache doesn't find the data the kernel wrote because it
has a different virtual index, so userspace reads stale data.
