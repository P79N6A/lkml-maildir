This is interesting, because I am using 2.4.12 SMP with > 1 GB RAM,
devfs, and I am also seeing large unnatural pauses with xine. However,
only with one particular DVD ("BlackAdder : Back and Forth"). I tried
the suggested fix of:
sleep 100000 < /dev/cdroms/rdvd&
and it *did* work. The slider control started working again as well.
I have no idea why it affects this one particular DVD and not others;
I had thought that it was a xine bug.
BTW, I have patched my kernel to at least create the /dev/rawctl
device and /dev/raw directory when using devfs. It's better than
nothing.
Cheers,
Chris
