Hum, the mappings I was referring to are the virual memory mappings of
all processes, which is not at all what interests us here.
Let's use the PFN then.
I see that the standard macro to get the kernel address from a pfn is :
asm-x86/page_32.h:#define pfn_to_kaddr(pfn)      __va((pfn) << PAGE_SHIFT)
The question might seem trivial, but I wonder how this deals with large
pages ?
