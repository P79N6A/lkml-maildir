With the effect that the dcache is completely useless for small filesystems
as long as there is one big one. Filesystems where regularily a small amount
of files is used don't have any cached dentries but the filesystem where
someone touched every file still has a lot of dentries in cache although they
are never used again.

This probably is the way to go.

Ooops, I was still thinking of the global-unused-list here.
