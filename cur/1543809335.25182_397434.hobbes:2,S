That was because we needed a local copy of libsysfs due to linking
against klibc.  Also because we needed to fix up libsysfs to actually
work for our needs :)
Anyway, we've now dropped libsysfs entirely, replacing it with 200 lines
of code that is much faster and more flexible.

libsysfs dried up and blew away when IBM abandonded it and stoped
funding the developers who were working on it.  Projects need active
developers, something that IBM was not willing to provide for this one,
for whatever reason...

Again, please complain if we break anything, we want to know, and I'll
do my best to keep it from happening.
