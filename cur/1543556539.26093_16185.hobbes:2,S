Agreed.

CAN_UNUSE() is not used at all for the final forcible removal of an inode
that has no users.

Indeed. We'd be better off marking them clean, to make sure they never hit
the disk.

Stephen is _wrong_ wrt fsync().
Why?
Think about it for a second. How the hell could you even _call_ fsync() on
a file that no longer exists, and has no file handles open to it?
By the time we call clear_inode(), fsync() had better not be an issue any
more. The only reason fscyn() could be an issue is if somebody starts
calling clear_inode() left and right, but hey, if that happens your
filesystem would be so FUBAR'ed that you really wouldn't care any more.
Data integrity of "fsync()" is the least of your worries.
