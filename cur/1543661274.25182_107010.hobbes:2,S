There are two Linux drivers for it.  One is 3com's, a bit shoddy but Ion 
B. did a nice job of cleaning it up.  The other is David Dillow's; DD's 
driver looks really good, supports NAPI and all sorts of bells and whistles.
I'm currently waiting to see if DD's driver gets the stamp of approval 
from a certain legal department.  If that doesn't come through soon, the 
"backup plan" kicks into effect, and Ion's cleanup of 3com's driver gets 
merged.
Neither driver hooks into the 2.5.x CryptoAPI, AFAIK...
