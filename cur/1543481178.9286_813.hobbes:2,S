	That's a known bug in realaudio.  There is a shim replacement for
"open" that can be preloaded in front of realaudio to work around the
problem until realaudio gets fixed.
	Seems like I found the errata up on the ReadAudio site and downloaded
the fix from a link that they provided.

	There was a change in the kernels, but the change was to correct
incorrect behavior.  Sorry, I don't remember the details.
