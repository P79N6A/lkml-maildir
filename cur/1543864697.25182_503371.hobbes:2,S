And seems to do 802.11b only and screw up the eeprom settings so that
the windows driver gets confused next time you boot windows.  Lovely
driver.  If the bios on the laptop in question would let me change the
minipci card I would.  To something with a ralink on it.
Seems the ralink driver maintainers are doing a lot of the work on the
core wifi infastructure too.  Lots of work beyond just the driver then.
