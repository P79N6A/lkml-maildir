Hello,
While Con's token-disable patch has fixed the screen freezes, the kswapd CPU 
load issue at the start of a memory hog remained. 
On another matter, Andrew Morton posted this patch:

Rik hinted that it could be the cause of the CPU eating problem. I have 
applied it (to 2.6.10-rc3 with token-disable and vm-throttling already 
applied), and - BINGO! No noticeable kswapd CPU load at all!
