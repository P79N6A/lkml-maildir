The fact that all the wireless tools print...
Warning: Driver for device eth1 has been compiled with version 20
of Wireless Extension, while this program supports up to version 17.
...shows that wireless is not as backwards compatible as usual kernel
ABIs are. I'm afraid that wireless extensions can not be helped
(designed with back-compatibility at wrong place), but can we make
sure new netlink ABI does not have similar problems?
