OK, there might be a way to do this (and yes, I can think of one...).
However, I doubt it makes sense: using strings in depmod.c and in the
hotplug utilities is even worse than in file2alias.c. For example, 
whitespace is used as delimitier for the values being parsed in hotplug
scripts. So I think the better (as simpler and thus more difficult to break)
approach is using crc32.
