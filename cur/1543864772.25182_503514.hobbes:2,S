The cifs entries in the dmesg log do not indicate any errors, much less 
show the cause of this
particular problem.
The repeated entry:
        CIFS VFS: Send error in SETFSUnixInfo = -5
is expected on connection to certain older versions of Samba servers (or 
other servers that 
only partially support the current CIFS Unix Extensions).  It is harmless.
It would be useful to know (e.g. if it is possible to trace the network 
traffic on the server side on your NAS box) whether
any network traffic from the client is being sent when (or just before) 
the hang occurs.
It is possible that the restarting of the NAS box allows reconnection of 
the smb/cifs session to proceed
which presumably could be hanging or looping in the network adapter 
driver, the tcp stack or cifs on
the client, but it is hard to tell without more information.   I don't 
know much about either of the
GigE drivers loaded on your system to determine if there is an easy way to 
tell their state.
There are various ways to analyze system hangs including (at least in some 
cases) getting a system dump which
can be used to isolate the failing location - hopefully
