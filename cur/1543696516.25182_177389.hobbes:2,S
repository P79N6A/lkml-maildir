Subject: syscall numbers larger than 255?

Just a quick and simple question for someone that knows the answer.
Stock 2.4.20 for i386 uses syscalls up to 252.  I want to add about a 
half-dozen new syscalls (forward porting stuff that we've got on 2.4.18).
Does x86 support syscall numbers > 255?  If yes, do I have to do 
anything special to use them? If not, what are my options?
Thanks,
Chris
