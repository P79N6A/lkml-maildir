I guess this will require adding a line:
	.create = cgroup_create
line to the:
	static struct file_operations cgroup_file_operations = {
initialization in kernel/cgroup.c, and a cgroup_create() routine
in kernel/cgroup.c, that calls an optional per-cgroup-subsystem
create routine, that, in the case of cpusets, is willing to create
one of these irqs.N.name files, in the top cpuset, if all looks
right.
