I do "# ls -lR / >/root/ls-lR"; and at some point (non-deterministic) my 
system locks up hard (e.g., sometimes software watchdog even detects lockup)
confirmed several times
once i did "# for i in /*; do ls -lR $i>>/root/ls-lR; done"; it 
succeded, when i did "#less /root/ls-lR" afterwards, it hung up again.
