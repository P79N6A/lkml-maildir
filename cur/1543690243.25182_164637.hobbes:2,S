OK,
I've posted the following:
GOOD WORKING CONFIG
http://phildev.net/config-working
GOOD WORKING DMESG
http://phildev.net/dmesg-working
NON WORKING CONFIG
http://phildev.net/config-bad
NON WORKING DMESG
http://phildev.net/dmesg-bad
As a recap...
For the non-working config, when I boot, the onboard VIA is recognized 
by the generic IDE driver, and then I did the dmesg, and then I 
modprobed CMD64X and it **reasigned** ide0 and ide1 to the PCI IDE 
card's chains and the original ide0 and ide1 disappeared, I therefore 
lost my hard drive, and the machine becomes unresponsive. I think that 
**might** be a bug in the CMD64X driver?
If I can provide more info, please let me know. I've kept the other 
kernel around so that I may boot into it if need be.
And as I said before, compiling hte VIA and CMD drivers both into the 
works fine on my machine, and I appreciate help getting that working, 
but I would like to either understand the above behavior, or know its a 
bug, or...
Thanks again for all your help. It really is much appreciated.
