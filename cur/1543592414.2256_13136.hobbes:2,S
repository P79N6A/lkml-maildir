So?  It just deadlocks in create_buffers/alloc_pages.  We finished
debugging that weeks ago, and I'm not interested in repeating that.

Well, this is the infrastructure for guaranteeing atomic allocations.  The
only beautifying it really needs is in adding an alloc_pages variant that
takes the reservation pool as a parameter instead of the current mucking
with current->page_reservation.

I simply meant that the reservation code wasn't bent on providing atomic
allocations for non-atomic allocators.  IIRC, I hooked into __alloc_pages
after the normal mechanism of allocating pages failed, but where it may
have already slept, but I think that was part of the other patch I posted
in the last email.  Our tree contains a lot of patches, and some of the
effects like this are built on top of each other, so I'm not surprised
that a critical piece like that was missing.
