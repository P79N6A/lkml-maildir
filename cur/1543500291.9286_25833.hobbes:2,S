Reading from my ANSI C reference:
	assert checks the value of the given expression.  If the expression is
	false (zero), assert prints a message into the standard error stream
and
	calls abort.
Looking at /usr/include/assert.h verifies this.  assert() always calls
abort() and always has.  It certainly makes sense to have an assert
macro that does not abort, but it is incorrect to claim that the normal
assert does not kill the program.
