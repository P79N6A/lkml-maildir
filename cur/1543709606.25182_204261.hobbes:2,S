Yes, patches to support quota exist for 2.4.x kernels, because 2.4.x is
not supposed to support quota for reiserfs in the vanilla distribution.
Those patches are at
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/patches/reiserfs/quota-2.4
and work fine.
But kernel 2.6.x is supposed to support quota for ext2, ext3 _and_
reiserfs without any patch. So I am doing something wrong (I hope), or
there is a bug around here.
