Hi all !!
In this crazy world every programer can meet strange computer devices.
These devices are software configurable, but not compatible with
common configuration methods (like PCI or ISA PNP).
Because of this strange design, the driver itself must find and assign
resources for such device.
So my question is: "What is most correct method to find free IRQ line ?"
Thank you for future answers :)
Andrey.
