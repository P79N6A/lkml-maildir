Cause: gcc is slow
Symptom: builds are slow
Fix: make gcc fast
That fix won't happen, so we cache the results.
We have two ways to do this:
a. use "make", relying solely on timestamps
b. use "ccache", which uses an md5 checksum AFAIK
With ccache, one could even get rid of make.
It's redundant; just use a shell script. :-)
