Hi all,
as topic, do anyone know is there any difference between them ? by the 
way, console should only output but not input , but i could still see 
something when i type " cat /dev/console"  in one terminal then type 
something at the tty where i open the console.  Can anyone tell me why?
Regards,
TOM
