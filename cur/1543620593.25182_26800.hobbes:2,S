Yeah, right, and now people hope that commiting to some obscure
repository will be enough get it to Linus ?
Lemme tell ya, the result is that it won't get not only to Linus, but
to the majority of the community.
Sorry, hoping that some _tool_ will solve the (supposed) problems in
the kernel development is just plain stupid.

PS. Interesting trend to note is the usually the amount of whining is
inversely proportional to one's contribution to the kernel.
