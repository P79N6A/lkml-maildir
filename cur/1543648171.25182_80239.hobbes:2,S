Since you are doing changes to the VM, I would like detail descriptions
of what each change does, and why it is necessary, stability- or
security-wise. I will not accept changes to the VM subsystem unless
there is a valid reason; let the early v2.4-series be witness to why
this is a good stance.
Speedups are generally not counted as a valid reason, unless we're
talking a change in the order of a magnitude or more. Code cleanup
might be a good reason, but then I'll merge it into the 2.0.41-tree
instead; this will probably be the case for your lxdialog-fixes, since
I'm cleaning up that code anyway for 2.0.41.
