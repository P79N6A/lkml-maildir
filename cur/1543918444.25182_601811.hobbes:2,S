thanks - I have added this to the queue.
i'm wondering about the following: could not (yet) existing UIDs be made 
configurable too? I.e. if i do this in a bootup script:
  echo 2048 > /sys/kernel/uids/500/cpu_share
this should just work too, regardless of there not being any UID 500 
tasks yet. Likewise, once configured, the /sys/kernel/uids/* directories 
(with the settings in them) should probably not go away either.
