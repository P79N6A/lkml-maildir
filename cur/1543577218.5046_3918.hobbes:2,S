And the ret and other stuff, you now have to search thru memory for a
10-byte sequance (sya?) to do the correct thing, what are the chances of
finding that, never mind coding all the stuff to find that into a faked
packet or whatever, this is gonna make the r00ter's life (do they have
one? ;) a lot harder, plus it will take a while to make a solution that
works.
