Not udev, but SUSE 10.2's network renaming. It uses udev and calls
ifrename in the same code path. 10.3 uses the unified version from the
udev tree.

There is a check for the same name in udev for long.

We should probably just add the check to kobject_rename() and print a
simple warning and then do nothing. Or just do the check in the network
ioctl, if we really don't want to see this.

We should really keep it, it already exposed a lot of serious bugs in
the kernel and users, we never spotted before.
