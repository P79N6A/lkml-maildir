One possible way to proceed might be to add a new callback that takes a
pm_message_t: powerdown()  If it exists, it would be called in both the
suspend and shutdown paths, before the suspend() and shutdown() calls to
that driver are made.  As drivers are fixed to clean up and combine that
code, they could put the merged result into the powerdown() function,
and remove their suspend() and shutdown() functions.
