A free technology hardware i2c <-> parport adaptor powered from the parallel
port featuring optical isolation.
Now I have (hopefully - according to some measurements) working airwire
prototype and a known working other board with pcf8591 chip that measures
temperature.
As soon as the adaptor is verified to run flawlessly, it will be redesigned
into a PCB and the result published under GPL in the same style as Ronja
Twister 
http://ronja.twibright.com/twister/index.php
I have already written the driver for it (added type=6 into i2c-parport.c and
extended the struct adapter_parm .init entry with .init2 and .init3 because the
hardware requires lines d0-d7, init and /autofd to be set to electrical H
simultaneously for the electronics to work) and now I am trying to make it
find the pcf8591 chip connected to it and read some data.
