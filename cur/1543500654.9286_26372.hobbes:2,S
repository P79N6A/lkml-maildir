In a NeXT style browser that might not be too bad. You would need one
open directory for each heirarchy level from left to right (If you
are familair with the NeXT browser).
A desktop app would have to keep a poll on every icon represented file
on the desktop. However, if the browser or desktop have an fd, the
file won't actually delete until the app closes it's fd. So does the
poll tell you that a delete is pending? Does it treat a delete on a file
with hardlinks the same as one that does not? Would I be right in
guessing that it is up to the userland prog to stat and figure all this
out?

NFS can be pretty slow in any case, so why would I expect poll() to
be better than the underlying fs? :-)
