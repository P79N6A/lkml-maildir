There are two possible objections to this:
 * Some developers keep the same kernel running and load/unload then reload
   a new driver when debugging. This would break probably or at least cause
   a large amount of kernel growth. Not that big an issue for me personally
   but driver writers seem to get hit with all the changes.
 * Drivers might get sloppy about not cleaning up timers and data structures
   -- more than they are already.  You might want to have a kernel debug option
   that overwrite's the unloaded text with something guaranteed to cause an 
   oops.
