Greetings.  I've made some small changes to the Wave Artist driver so it
may be used on the PC with the Shark Multimedia Mako III sound card.  It
doesn't work quite right yet, but in case anyone wants to try it, it can
be found at:

Come to think of it, the patch will be there even if no one wants it. 8) 
If you do, you'll need to enable CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, CONFIG_SOUND,
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS, and CONFIG_SOUND_MAKO.
