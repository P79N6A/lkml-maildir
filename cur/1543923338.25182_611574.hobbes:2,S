Sounds fine.

Bitmaps in the attribute groups?

Are you sure that you want to return an array index here, instead of the
actual attribute? Like:
  int (*filter_show)(struct kobject *kobj, struct attribute *attr);
The names "show" and "store" are the ususal file-operation names, and we
are not filtering a "show" here, right? Maybe "create", or "export", or
something else might be a better name?
Thanks,
