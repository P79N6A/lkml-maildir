It buys you some preformance. Someone here already mentioned variable stripe
sizes. ZFS doesn't just add a checksum sector after each block (something
i've been planning to write an md module for, for a couple years). It writes
the checksum at the end of the tree member, inode, dirent, whatever. So
there's no read-modify-write when you write < 1 checksum block size.
One thing i noticed about zfs that surprised me: it's using indirect blocks,
from what i saw.
