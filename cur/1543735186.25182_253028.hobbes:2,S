It's not about readability.
It's about the first case being WRONG!
You can't add two values in the wrong byte-order. It's not an operation 
that makes sense. You _have_ to convert them to CPU byte order first.
I certainly agree that the first version "looks nicer".

This is actually the strongest argument _against_ hiding endianness in the 
compiler, or hiding it behind macros. Make it very explicit, and just make 
sure there are tools (ie 'sparse') that can tell you when you do something 
wrong.
Any programmer who sees the above will go "well that's stupid", and 
rewrite it as something saner instead. You can certainly rewrite it as
	cpu_sum = le16_to_cpu(a) + le16_to_cpu(b);
	cpu_sum |= le16_to_cpu(c);
	cpu_sum += le16_to_cpu(d);
	sum = cpu_to_le16(d);
which gets rid of the double conversions. 
But if you hide the endianness in macro's, you'll never see the mess at 
all, and won't be able to fix it.

I would have agreed with you some time ago. Having been bitten by too damn 
many bompiler bugs I'e become convinced that the compiler doing things 
behind your back to "help" you just isn't worth it. Not in a kernel, at 
least. It's much better to build up good typechecking and the 
infrastructure to help you get the job done.
Expressions like the above might happen once or twice in a project with
several million lines of code. It's just not worth compiler infrastructure
for - that just makes people use it as if it is free, and impossible to
find the bugs when they _do_ happen. Much better to have a type system 
that can warn about the bad uses, but that doesn't actually change any of 
the code generated..
