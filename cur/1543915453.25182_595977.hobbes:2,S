copyright assertion == claim of ownership, or posession.
posession is 9/10 of the law.
was it petty of UCB to claim copyrights over code USL claimed ownersip
of?
was it also petty of Novell to claim that they, and not SCO, owned
the copyright to UNIX?
sorry, but calling attribution claims of any sort "petty" is nothing
short of dangerous ignorance.
