as always, I am speaking for my own and colegues expierence.
We are using dell SMP machines with p3 and p4, different speeds. Plus 
hardware SCSI raid5's.
For samba, and VoIP services, CVS, and mail. Maybe JFS works nicely with 
NFS, but my expierence shows
that XFS  is the slowest among all filesystems vaillia linux 2.6  can 
serve.  JFS was not so extensively tested, but it doesn't do miracles, 
and expierence shows it's rather close to XFS. Reiserfs so far was the 
finest. Maybe because we have pretty much number of files, mostly small 
ones. I don't know.
I didn't ment to hurt anyone's feelings, just giving my opinion on FSs.
Thanks.
