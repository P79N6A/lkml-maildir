I've filed a bug on the non working of the onstream DI-30 tape backup. 
Is there any chance of this getting fixed before 2.6.0. See also this 
bug report.

When using the tape drive the system violently locks up and only a 
reboot seems to work. This looks to me as a bug that would need some 
fixing or a marker that the driver is broken at this point in time
