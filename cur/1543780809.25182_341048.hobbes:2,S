Zwane,
I don't know the context of your work here, but a couple of 
observations.
Since you populate cpu_possible_map with NR_CPUS, alloc_percpu()
would end up allocating for all NR_CPUS.  Wouldn't you have achieved
the same thing by compile time allocation ? Wouldn't this change
lead to NR_CPUS allocations from alloc_percpu() for all users ?
Now since you have separated cpu_possible_map from cpu_callout_map,
do we need to reflect cpu_possible_map with the value from
cpu_callout_map after the cpu_callout_map is initialized fully from
smp_prepare_cpus().
BTW, I am working on Kiran's dynamic percpu allocator patch and making
it cpu hotplug aware. With that, alloc_percpu would initially allocate
only for the possible cpus and would allocate for other cpus as and when
they come up.
Regards,
Bharata.
