Hi Marcelo,
I re-worked all the applicable stack reduction patches for 2.4.19-rc1.
I made 6 different patches, one for each area to pick and choose easily.
Here are the stack reductions for each these:
do_execve                    320
number                       100
nfs_lookup                   184
__revalidate_inode           112
rpc_call_sync                144
xprt_sendmsg                 120
If you have any suggestions, more cleanups or re-works, please let me 
know.
Thanks,
Badari
