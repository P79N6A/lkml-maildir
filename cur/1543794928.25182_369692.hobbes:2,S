Getting latest try via git is _really_ easy:
mkdir clean-cg; cd clean-cg
cg-init
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
... Do cg-update origin to pickup latest changes from Linus. You can
do cg-diff to see what changes you done in your local tree. cg-cancel
will kill any such changes, and cg-commit will make them permanent.
Sorry, I did not have time to look what's wrong with miniconfig, yet.
