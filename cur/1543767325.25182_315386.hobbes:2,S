I see one small change in behaviour with this kernel.
During boot when initializing udev I see 
Initializing udev dynamic device directory.
grep: /proc/ide/sr0/model: No such file or directory
grep: /proc/ide/sr1/model: No such file or directory
With previous kernels I only see
Initializing udev dynamic device directory.
This machine has no IDE device at all, only SCSI, and the kernel config 
has no IDE support either. The config I'm using has not changed in any 
ways that I think would cause this (it's the same as I used with 
2.6.12-rc2-mm3, just ran oldconfig on it and build the new kernel).
