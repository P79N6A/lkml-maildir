Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Linux hotplug memory mailing list created
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/2/27/266

I'd like to announce a new mailing list that has been started up to
focus on adding support to Linux for hotplug memory.
As I personally know of at least 3 different groups at 3 different
companies working on this feature, and all of them don't seem to want to
talk together on linux-kernel or linux-mm, this list is for them, and
anyone else who wants to help.
Please everyone, work together and stop re-inventing the wheel...
Info on joining the list can be found at:
  
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linux-hotplug-memory
The list is open to any posters (subscription not required), and no HTML
messages are allowed on it.  The address is:
  linux-hotplug-memory@lists.sourceforge.net
If anyone has any questions or problems with the list, please let me
know.
thanks,
greg k-h
