>Well, the weird part is that the transmitting bytes are working properly...
Yeah.  I just looked at the driver and it does indeed implement the tx byte 
counter but not the rx one.  Bizarre.
To make it work you just need to add something along the lines of `np->
stats.rx_bytes += skb->len;' at about line 1053, I imagine.
