If I understand this correctly, that means once the queue is too long
(latency wise) the elevator will stop working completely, because all
requests will be served in the order they come in. right?
If multiple queues are used, so performance is OK even when the first
queue is full (too old), the discussion about how to tell if the queue
is too old or not (by time or requests) becomes less important. After
all, there is no reason not to start a new queue pretty often, even on a
fast device.
The correct behavoir would be to reorderder the new requests
individually even if the queue is alreaddy too long. In other words -
multiple queues.

If a new request is made for a sector before the current sector (the
sector of the last request to be served), the new request should be
added to the second queue even if the first one is not too old.
