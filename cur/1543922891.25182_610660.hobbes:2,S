The README contains the following description.
"...
	"make oldconfig"   Default all questions based on the contents of
			   your existing ./.config file and asking about
			   new config symbols.
	"make silentoldconfig"
			   Like above, but avoids cluttering the screen
			   with questions already answered.
..."
I did not expect that there are more differences besides the "silence".

I did that clean-up step.

I hope not because I've setup symbolic links to point to the current release as far I know
instead of the release "2.6.22.9-0.4-default" that I am using at the moment.

It is relevant in my case if I want to use different output directories for parallel
builds from the same source directory.
