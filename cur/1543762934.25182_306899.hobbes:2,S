Yep - I may have even stolen it from you (or someone) from a patch
which had been forgotten. I can't remember for sure, but it is trivial
enough that anyone could come up with it if they noticed, so I won't
worry about attribution ;)

OK cool, that was the main thing I was unsure of.

Ahh yes I forgot it was backing it with a mempool. The problem I see
with that is that GFP_ATOMIC allocations eat into the mm's "atomic
reserve" pool (main use: networking), which would be nice not to.
So long as we are sure that we'll *eventually* fall back to the mempool,
it should be OK (but I still agree should have testing) - that isn't
entirely clear though, because the page allocator infinitely loops on
small allocations unless __GFP_NORETRY is set.
Andrew - tell me I'm missing something?
