Its a defacto convention for most C-language apps, see, for 
example Xlib, gtk and gnome.  Also, "grep typedef include/linux/*"
shows that many kernel device drivers use this convention.

There were many cases where it did not warn (I don't remember 
the case of subr calls). I beleive this had to do with ANSI-C spec
issues dating to the 1990's; traditional C is weakly typed.
Its not just gcc; anyoe who coded for a while eventually discovered
that tyedefs where strongly typed, but "struct blah *" were not.

:-/  Yes, of course.
