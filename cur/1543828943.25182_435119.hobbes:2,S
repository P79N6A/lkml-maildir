The SD Association decided to release a specification for the SDHCI
controllers. This set of patches updates the current driver, which is
based on reverse engineering, to comply with the official specification.
It has been tested for quite some time by people on the sdhci-devel list.
Although it doesn't solve all known issues, it doesn't cause any new ones.
