We certainly can. But if you insist of using mmap sem at all, then we have a 
problem.
rbtree would not reduce cacheline bouncing, so :
We could use a hashtable (allocated on demand) of size N, N depending on 
NR_CPUS for example. each chain protected by a private spinlock. If N is well 
chosen, we might reduce lock cacheline bouncing. (different threads fighting 
on different private futexes would have a good chance to get different 
cachelines in this hashtable)
As soon a process enters 'private futex' code, the futex code allocates this 
hashtable if the process has a NULL hash table (set to NULL at exec() time, 
or maybe re-allocated because we want to be sure futex syscall always suceed 
(no ENOMEM))
So we really can... but for 'private futexes' which are the vast majority of 
futexes needed by typical program (using POSIX pshared thread mutex attribute 
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, currently not used by NPTL glibc)
Of course we would need a new syscall, and to change glibc to be able to 
actually use this new private_futex syscall.
Probably a lot of work, still, but could help heavy threaded programs not 
touching mmap_sem.
We might have a refcounting problem on this 'hashtable' since several threads 
share this structure, but only at thread creation/destruction, not in futex 
call (ie no cacheline bouncing on the refcount)
