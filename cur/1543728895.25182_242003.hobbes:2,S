You are correct, but from the mq_send/mq_timedsend DESCRIPTION:
``If the specified message queue is not full, mq_send() shall behave as if the
message is inserted into the message queue at the position indicated by the
msg_prio argument.''
and from ERRORS:
``The mq_send() and mq_timedsend() functions shall fail if:
[EAGAIN] The O_NONBLOCK flag is set in the message queue description
associated with mqdes, and the specified message queue is full.''
Thus, if full could be interpreted as to also mean that there is no memory
to store the message, returning ENOMEM is not allowed and EAGAIN
would have to be used in stead since an implementation isn't allowed to
use a different error number for the same error condition.
If full is taken to mean that the queue contains its maximum number
of messages, which I think is the correct meaning, then returning ENOMEM
is not allowed, i.e. the queue has to be preallocated, I think, since the
description states that a message shall be added if the queue is not full.
