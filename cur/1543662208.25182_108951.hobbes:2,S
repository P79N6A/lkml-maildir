Subject: [patch] kernel_flag is not needed on UP+preempt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is no reason to define and declare the actual kernel_flag spinlock
on UP systems, even if kernel preemption is enabled.
Preempt needs to use the lock_kernel() calls, but it does not need the
actual lock to exist.
So change the check from SMP || PREEMPT to just SMP.  Tests fine.  Patch
is against 2.5.60.
