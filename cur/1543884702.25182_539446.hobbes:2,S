Yes.  I guess in this context, I am generally for building the ELF
headers by hand instead of with a linker script, because then we
know exactly what is happening and can ensure everything is just so.

Sorry, for not being clear I have been expecting to do this for years,
it is one of the reasons I keep coming back to putting an ELF header
on the bzImage.  arch/x86_64/kernel already does this to some extent
as it has to setup up some identity page mappings for itself in the
case it has to do the switch from real to protected mode itself.

Right.  Except that there is a bit of a catch 22 in the
para-virtualized environments of setting up the page tables, I'm not
at all certain what the gain of setting up p != v mappings are.
Having just written some C code that runs fairly successfully in p !=
v, on arch/i386 I'm not too concerned.  arch/x86_64 ought to work with
a similar level of effort although the expectations there are a little
different. So while I don't necessarily considering running in p != v
when compiled to run at v general it should work for the cases we
are interested in.  Setting up the page tables for arch/x86_64 will
be more interesting.
Part of what I find compelling about this is our initial page tables
for linux have always had more going on than the virtual addresses
just being at a constant offset from of the physical addresses, so
the actions of the current domain builders have me concerned that they
may be violating some early linux booting assumptions and are
currently just getting lucky.  Moving the page table setup code into
the kernel removes that dependency from the domain builders.
