The 2.6.13.2 data is inconsistent. The bug appears to be present there at
well after closer examination. So there must be another factor involved
because I have at least one case logged where 2.6.13.2 did work (the
"sirkka" log in my previous mail). Applying your patch on 2.6.13.2
again removes the protocol is buggy messages (when doing a tcpdump)
but the problem of the 10 missing packets persists.
