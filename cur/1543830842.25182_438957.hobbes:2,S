Hmm.  I just found out that this patch makes our serial+parallel PCI cards unusable..
because.. well.. because it effectively turns parport_serial OFF, without a way to
select it either as a module or built-in.  Because on 2.6.16, there's NO such
config symbol - SERIAL_8250_PCI.  Ie, the original Kconfig was right, but this
change just broke (disabled) parport_serial module completely.
In contrast, in 2.6.17 (as Andrey Borzenkov correctly pointed out), this change IS
needed (see eg. 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/18/117
).
I've no idea how this patch slipped into 2.6.16 -stable queue in the first place... ;)
Thanks.
