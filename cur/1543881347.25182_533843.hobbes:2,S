Tony Luck added to cc list as I believe he had a lot to do with the speed
improvements within the bootmem allocator and might suggest a better fix.
Subject: Check zone boundaries when freeing bootmem
Zone boundaries do not have to be aligned to MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES. However,
during boot, there is an implicit assumption that they are aligned to a
BITS_PER_LONG boundary when freeing pages as quickly as possible. This
patch checks the zone boundaries when freeing pages from the bootmem allocator.
