Hello Roger,
this does not solve my problem with NFS-copies. Just for information. I tried and did not work.
Besides I expected the patch to make the free pages pool somehow bigger during file-copies, but ended up with this situation:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:

The MemFree isn't really a lot compared to inact_dirty. knfsd fails at least.
