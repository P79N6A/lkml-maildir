It will not be *much* slower. You gain some speed by not having to
write anything, too. And done properly, it is going to be simple. Lets
see what Rafael comes up with.
[Big advantage is that /proc/list-me-pagecache can be implemented
without any dependencies on the rest of swsusp code, and is likely to
be useful for speeding up boot, etc.]
