Hm, Kudzu shouldn't care, you just should not be able to load the
usb-ohci module on startup.  At least that's what happens to me on my
boxes.
Anyway, here's the documentation that you need:
	The module usb-ohci is now gone.  Use ohci-hcd instead.
The people with UHCI controllers have a big more documentation to read:
	The module uhci is now gone.  If you used this module, use
	uhci-hcd instead.  The module usb-uhci is now gone.  If you used
	this module, use usb-uhci-hcd instead.  If you have a preference
	over which UHCI module works better for you, please email
	greg@kroah.com your comments, as one of these modules will be
	going away in the near future.

Heh, I don't mess around with module aliasing, so I don't know the first
thing of what to do in this situation.  Someone reading the above
documentation should be able to figure it all out.

We really don't use CHANGES anymore.  Where do you propose things like
the above few sentences go to where everyone will know to look?
