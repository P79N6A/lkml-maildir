Some times ago I wanted to change the mixer part and get back to the
"original" one, with a single mixer ... but as it was intentional, I
left it like this.
However I think it would be a good thing to present, to the user, a
single mixer. You have 1 or more soundcards and each soundcard have a
single mixer that control all the volume available with this card, no ?
If Alan has not yet released a patch that changes this ... I could try
to put all the controls back together ... and it will be the occasion to
learn a little bit more of that "mighty and scaring kernel" :)
