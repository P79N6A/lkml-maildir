s/same core idea/same core code/
Go search around, get the code you can still find on the net and start
diffing.  So not only do the RTAI people have an issue with the patent,
it looks like they'd better be conforming to the GPL as well.  Didn't
RTAI switch the copyright on "their" sourcebase to LGPL?  So explain to
me how you can take a GPLed source base, change it, and then change the
license.  Are you saying that 100% of that source base has been rewritten?
