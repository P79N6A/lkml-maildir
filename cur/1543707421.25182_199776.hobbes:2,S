it has not always had been broken, it was was serialized by the BKL when
I worked on that code the last time ;) (so it wasn't broken in 2.2, just nobody
fixed the locking when the kernel kept evolving)
the smp safety is broken, but the model is not obviously broken as you
claim. the locking of the list could be fixed simply with a
parport_lock spinlock or semaphore or whatever like that, you may prefer
to fix it differently keeping the list local in the lowlevel and
protected it to a private lock to parport_pc instead of making it
visible and exporting hte lock too, I'm just saying that part of the
code was legitimate at least in 2.2.
