Maintaining drivers out of tree is shameless autoflagellation at the
best of times. We really don't care -- if we didn't make life hard for
them in this way they'd only go and stick pins under their fingernails
to make up for the lack of pain. If you think about it like that, we're
probably doing them a favour -- at least this way they're _safe_.
