You don't need to load another module, since __wake_up_sync is part of
the kernel.  You are probably running into a problem with module
versions.  When you do:
    $ grep __wake_up_sync /proc/ksyms 
you will probably get something like:
    c01147e0 __wake_up_sync_R08c2a6b5
The _R08c2a6b5 part of the symbol name is the version, which comes
from the ".ver" files in your kernel include tree.  You will have to
include <linux/modversions.h> to get the correct definition for
__wake_up_sync.
By the way, 2.4.7 is an extremely old kernel, and you may avoid
problems by moving to something newer.
Best,
  Roland
