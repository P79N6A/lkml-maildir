As a result of your feedback, I have written a slightly more elaborate
patch, featuring:
- dynamically adjusts to the actual kbd repeat delay, by computing a
  min among delays (no smaller than 100ms (HZ/10) in order to avoid
  taking glitches into account).  This makes hardcoding of the delay
  (the so much blamed 250ms) unnecessary (n.b. - smbd was right, it is
  smaller than 250, on my laptop it is 200ms - good :-)).
- logging _actual_ kbd glitches, and only the first in a row.  I also
  log, the actual minimum kbd delay, so people will know what their
  kbd's actual delay is :-) If you want, I can make some more kbd
  statistics in that routine and print them...
It's funny, I started by writing a quick'n'dirty patch for my own use
and I will probably end up writing kbd software repeat (is it really a
demand for such a feature?  imagine that we would be able to set up
repeat rates of up to 100 cps!! :-)) Anyway, I am happy doing this,
between two consecutive cries (she has stomach aches, any known
remedies for a 1 month baby?) of my first newborn (Andra, 12 nov) late
in the night (in my TZ - EET Bucharest/Romania).  It would be neat if
a child's crying repeat delay/rate would be customizable :-)))
