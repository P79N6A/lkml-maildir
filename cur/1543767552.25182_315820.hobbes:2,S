Sounds great.  I'd be willing to maintain a quilt tree for
this - in fact, I've already got a few patches ;)
Also, we should probably keep track of exactly what we're
working towards.  I've put my ideas on a wiki page, feel
free to add yours - probably a new page for stuff that's
not page replacement related ;)
