No - it definitely isn't as simple as a 512 MB hole.  Depends on how much
memory is in each node, holes could be all kinds of sizes.  You could,
in theory, have had 128 MB in one node and 8 GB in another node.  I don't
think we had holes within the node from the software side - I think the
requirement was that all DIMMS were added in low to high memory slots.
Not sure what forced that requirement - could have been PTX, BIOS,
cache controllers, etc.
