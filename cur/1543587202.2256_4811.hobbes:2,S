Sequent Symmetry machinses supported SMP on i486 and even i386 going back
to the original 16MHz 386 processors. You could put up to 30 in a system.
I do not, however, envisage anyone porting Linux to these any time soon.
The hardware is just too "unusual" for it to be feasible. The later Symmetry
5000 machines might be slightly more practical, but I'm not sure if you'd have
room in your new house for one. You could probably do without central heating
if we did send you one :-)
