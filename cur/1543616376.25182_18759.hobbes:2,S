You are correct, the size of glibc is not a major problem for me right 
now and that's what I'm using.  However, it is the largest thing in my
initrd, which goes across the net using tftp, and glibc just keeps 
getting bigger...  I'm thinking of switching to ulibc when I get time.
One of the neat things about moving a lot of this formerly in-kernel
boot stuff to userspace is that it will be easier to do interesting
customization of the boot process, without having to hack the kernel.
I'm sure that this will be used in lots of innovative ways that people
haven't even thought of yet.  
So, I guess what I'd like to see with the initramfs build system is a 
easy way to build little apps like sfdisk and mkreiserfs against the 
libc it (normally) uses and add them to the ramdisk.
I'm not so worried for myself, but for an overworked sysadmin trying 
to customize the boot it could end up being very confusing...
