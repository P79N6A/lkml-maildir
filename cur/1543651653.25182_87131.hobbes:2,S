I don't think this is actually a good idea. We break forward compatibility with
this (possibly, in future we will want to add something like "yes" or you don't
know what..), and then you will still get "no" for no obvious reason - asking
is much saner approach here, IMHO. If we didn't understand it, assuming 'no' is
not a safe way, I believe.
