The gcc that comes with debian sid doesn't understand -m32.  That's a
32-bit gcc, which means that I set CROSS_COMPILE when doing a ppc64
kernel compile.  With your patch I have to set CROSS32_COMPILE as
well, which seems silly when I'm compiling on a ppc32 box already.
Ben H suggested making the default BOOTCC be $(CC) -m32, which makes
sense to me.
Paul.
