Subject: [PATCH 16/61] PM: Do not check parent state in suspend and resume core code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/11/546

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
The checks if the device's parent is in the right state done in
drivers/base/power/suspend.c and drivers/base/power/resume.c serve no particular
purpose, since if the parent is in a wrong power state, the device's suspend or
resume callbacks are supposed to return an error anyway.  Moreover, they are
also useless from the sanity checking point of view, because they rely on the
code being checked to set dev->parent->power.power_state.event appropriately,
which need not happen if that code is buggy.  For these reasons they can be
removed.
