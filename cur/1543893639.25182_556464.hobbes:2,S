Sorry this is not clear. We'd lose what with 'inactive' ticks?
If you are referring to the delta execution time a user's lrq consumed
in the middle of a tick and whether we would lose them during subsequent
update_load(), the answer IMO is no. Becasue put_prev_task_fair() would
account for the small delta execution time when the task/lrq got
descheduled.

I would say any lossy accounting would be bad in long run. If you think
put_prev_task_fair()->update_curr() still leaves open some problem, I
would be interested in knowing that.

If that is a problem (and I tend to agree that it is), then it is not unique to 
group lrq accounting. So we have common problems to solve :)

Yes sure, we need to fix that assumption that exec_delta64 can't be
greater than TICK_NSEC. And I assume you will fix that?

A user's weight controls fraction of CPU the user's tasks as a whole receive.
A task's weight controls fraction of CPU the task will receive -within-
the fraction alloted to that user.
Strictly speaking, a task's weight need not have to depend on its user's
weight. This is true if scheduler core recognizes both user and task levels of
scheduling in the hierarchy. If the scheduler were to recognize fewer
levels of hierarchy, then we will have to take into account a user's
weight in calculation task weight. See thread anchored at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/26/81
 for a description of this idea.

The load considered for determining busiest group/queue is the summation
of -all- task's load on a CPU. That's why I introduced update_load() in
Patch #4 which captures load from real-time tasks as well as
SCHED_NORMAL tasks. When you are changing that update_load() function
(based on class->update_load callback), it would be nice to keep this in
mind (that I need a weight field representing summation of all tasks
weights).

This probably comes from the split up raw_weighted_load/nr_running
fields. Although I don't know if the overhead is that noticeable in
practice. Let me know if you feel any difference with Patch #4 applied!

I still think that this 'stale' cpu_load data won't last long enough to
serious affect load balance decisions. But something I agree definitely to 
watch for during tests. Thanks for the heads up on this possibility!

:-)

I chose lrq to mean local run queue. Other names I can think of are
entity_rq or ...actually cfs_rq (as you suggest) sounds better. I will
make this change unless Ingo thinks otherwise.
