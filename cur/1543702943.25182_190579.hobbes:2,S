As you, probably, have already seen from further emails on this thread, we
did find out that packets were indeed lost due to various performance
reasons. And the best solution does seem to be switching to TCP-NFS, and
making it the default choice for mount (where available) seems to be a
very good idea.
Thanks for replying anyway.

Hm, as long as we are already on this - can you give me a hint / pointer
how does TCP _detect_ a congestion? Does it adjust packet sizes, some
other parameters? Just for the curiousity sake.
Thanks
