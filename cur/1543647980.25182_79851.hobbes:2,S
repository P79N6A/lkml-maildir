I've tried to test 2.5.42-mm2 but it doesn't compile.  There were (I 
assume 'sard') changes made to remove the DK_MAX_MAJOR etc. but there is 
to patch to drivers/md/md.c so it fails to compile:
# find -name \*.c | xargs grep DK_MAX_MAJOR
./drivers/md/md.c:static unsigned int sync_io[DK_MAX_MAJOR][DK_MAX_DISK];
./drivers/md/md.c:      if ((index >= DK_MAX_DISK) || (major >= 
DK_MAX_MAJOR))
./drivers/md/md.c:              if ((idx >= DK_MAX_DISK) || (major >= 
DK_MAX_MAJOR))
