I'm not sure.  I've definitely seen it frozen in the screensaver a few
times (not necessarily when it tries to come back -- I've seen the
screensaver stuck as well).  However, I did get a freeze just using
the console, and I've also gotten a freeze with the screensaver set to
just blank.
I guess right now I'm most suspicious about the following things:
 - radeon driver.  I've switched from radeonfb to vesafb and still had hangs
   X11 ati driver still could be an issue
 - ipw2200 driver
 - interrupt sharing (everything seems to be wired to IRQ 11)
Unfortunately since I haven't been able to get _any_ post-hang
debugging info it's hard to make progress debugging.
Thanks,
  Roland
