No. You should have the OPTION of stopping the machine, if accurate syslog
information is more important to you than system functionality. This
should also be an OS function, rather than just freezing processes as and
when they call syslog()!

inetd? I'd have thought init would make a more suitable choice, perhaps
with a monitor to lock the machine up or reboot if syslog fails and can't
be restored.

Again, that might be useful in some cases, but certainly shouldn't be the
only, or even default, mode.
