I finally got around to doing some debugging on this patch
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/1/7
). Firstly, I can't seem to reproduce
the SIGBUS issues I was seeing so I'm assuming that was some bug I
introduced somewhere along the line and/or something fixed in mainline.
The patch below is a diff on top of the patch linked to above so you can
see what I needed to change to make it work.
The patch you proposed locked upon entry to try_to_unuse_entry() as
shrink_page_list() already had the page locked. I therefore moved the
locking to try_to_unuse() but this is complicated by the retry loop. The
solution below handles this but is slightly ugly as it has the "magic"
locking sequence in two places and I'm not sure where the associated
comment should go. An alternative might be to return -EAGAIN and have
the caller perform the loop for us but I'm not keen on having to
replicate this to all call sites. We could also just check if the page
was locked by the caller? Whats the best way to handle this?
The refcounting was also broken which I solved by moving
page_cache_release() to try_to_unuse() with the locking. Alternatively,
should try_to_unuse_page_entry() increase some refcount?
I added a sanity check to make sure that if we unused a page and it was
no longer in swapcache, its dirty bit was cleared. I suspect this isn't
actually needed but should be harmless.
I also moved the pages with error check outside PageAnon(page) as
otherwise you can see IO loops where it continually tries to swap out a
page with errors.
With these changes, the patch has coped fine with the testing I've
exposed it to where entire swap devices sudden stopped accepting writes.
It happily marked every page in the swap partition bad with no
instabilities.
If we can agree a way to handle the page locking, I think this patch
might be ready for -mm? I'm happy to split it into a small series and
submit it...
