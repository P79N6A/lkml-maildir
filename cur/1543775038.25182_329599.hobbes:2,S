Especially considering you could add a tar/rsync flag to handle it for
you.  And most likely, each meta dir would have its own serialization
method (read: file) so that you didn't find yourself trying to back up
huge infinitely recursive structures, or accidentally triggering a huge
tar operation, or something...

Under my scheme, yes, and it works the same way.

I'm not sure if inodes are a problem, but this kind of stuff would be up
to the fs, not the attrfs or metafs.

Absolutely.  But I think both should exist, so that programs currently
using xattr will still work.  Maybe you'd have:
/meta/vfs/home/foo/attrs
or something...
Come to think of it, that changes the proposal a bit.  You need a
different way to access the meta-dir for files than for directories, if
we're going to support /meta/vfs.  No biggie:
/meta/vfs/file/home/bob/sue.mpg/acl
/meta/vfs/dir/home/bob/acl

I think we need both interfaces, especially because the /meta/vfs
interface makes looping easy.

Doesn't have the same effect.

No, it's not.  It's up to the user and the application developers.
Sure, I could mount /proc somewhere else, but that would confuse some
things.  Mounting /meta somewhere else would confuse even more things.

True, but I think they should still hand down a decree of where it is to
be mounted by default.
