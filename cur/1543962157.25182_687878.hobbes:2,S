I would say that this should be one of the main goals - have a team of people who
can consistently be assigned bugs for duplication and verification. Getting newly
opened bugs reproduced can be half the solution (and a great way to learn the
kernel on the side).
often the reporter of the bug never confirms that the bug is fixed - another place
where linux testers can help out...
