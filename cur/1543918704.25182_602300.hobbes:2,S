How is the lack of flexibility a problem?
Specifics please.
My impression is that the purpose of this patchset is to build
infrastructure to sort out a conflict between kdb and the kexec code,
which it does not do, and it can not do if it does not own up to
it's real purpose.
If I am correct in understanding the purpose of this patchset it does
not even address the problem it is aimed at solving.
