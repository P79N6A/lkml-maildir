| 
| If an abi directory was created, I'd be happy to submit a file or two at a 
| time into it (with the corresponding patches to remove the definitions from 
| the main include directory and #include abi/whatever instead...)
|

Yes, or sort of.  There's a linuxabi mailing list:
http://zytor.com/mailman/listinfo/linuxabi
and talk about doing a big push on this in early 2.7.
There are several interested parties, but I don't know how interested
the top-level maintainer is in accepting such patches.
