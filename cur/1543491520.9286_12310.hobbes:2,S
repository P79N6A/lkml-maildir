        On my Desktop box Fstab lists my /usr partition as /dev/hda3 and
    /home is /dev/hda5 and swap is /dev/hda7.  This is ok as this system works fine.
        The Omnibook is a different matter however.  I was having problems getting
    RH to install (at the Disk druid / fdisk stage) so I manually used fdisk
    and set up four partitions.  hda1 -> hda4.  I then editied fstab to reflect
    the 'new' partitions and their path.
        When I rebooted I get the message that the /usr, /home, and swap partions
    can't be found.
        Does Linux _have_ to have certain /{paths} located on certain devices ?
No. You choose the devices. You choose the mount points.
