Subject: linux v2.2.15pre14 interrupt problem on ad1848 driver?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
	Compiled linux 2.2.15pre14 with egcs v1.0.3 and libc6 v2.0.7 for
an Dell optiplex 333mhz with crystal sound support.  I've sent a copy
to the AD1816 maintainer since there is no one listed for ad1848 and he
was the closest match.
PROBLEM:
	dmesg below tells me that ad1848 failed interrupt test #7.
I've included dmesg, /proc/interrupts, /dev/sndstat, the insmod
stuff from /etc/rc.d/rc.modules and my kernel config file below.
NOTE: This wasn't a problem before in previous pre kernels ! 
      I haven't changed anything. I can play a ".wav" and midi ".mid" 
      file withou a problem with play/playmidi without it reporting an
      interrupt conflict.
