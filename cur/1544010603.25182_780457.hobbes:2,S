No. I mean each MSI-X entry has an address+message pair and each MSI-X entry
is associated with the parameters passed to each call of request_irq().
Pass in unique private data to each call of request_irq() and the driver
can determine which message was delivered when the ISR gets called.
(ISR == Interrupt Service Routine, aka driver IRQ handler)

Correct. The limit is defined by the number of GSI's available
from the HW.

Correct.
