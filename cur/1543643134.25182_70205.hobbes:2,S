I don't know what others think of this but i'd say that some
binary files are appropriate.  In a case like this i'd say
a files named 'nvram' and 'bios' or 'firmware' would be good
candidates for opaque binary structures and firmware.  This
is particularly the true if the data is purely related to
the device.  Ultimately it'd be nice to be able to upload
and download (install)  firmware this way.
Now if a datum is a parameter suitable for tuning i'd like
it made visible and updatable in an ASCII form.  In other
words i'd like to see an end to the proliferation of obscure
tools like hdparm.
These opinion does not necessarily reflect the views of
anyone else.
