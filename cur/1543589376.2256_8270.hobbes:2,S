I'm kind of curious; "deregister" is used quite often in the kernel:
pcmcia_deregister_client
pcmcia_deregister_erase_queue
misc_deregister
atm_dev_deregister
atm_proc_dev_deregister
usb_deregister_bus
usb_deregister
usb_serial_deregister
scsi_deregister_blocked_host
matroxfb_dh_deregisterfb
Not to mention in various comments and documentation.  Deregister,
according to www.m-w.com (and many other dictionaries), is not a word.
Is there some sort of historical significance to this being used, in
place of "unregister"?
