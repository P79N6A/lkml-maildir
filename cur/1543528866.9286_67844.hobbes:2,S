Calling them signals is a bit bizarre too, as under load the *last*
thing you do is pick them up via relatively slow signal delivery.
IMO a callback device that you simply read() the siginfo from would be
much the cleaner API.  For a start that would give >32 queues, ability
to group queues (the device itself may send siginfos to another queue),
no problems agreeing with your library which ones you're using, and a
"flat file" API which is generally quite nice..  But it's a bit late
now.
