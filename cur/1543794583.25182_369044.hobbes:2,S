Hello, maybe this question is not really related here, so I appologize before 
hand if that is the case. I recently downloaded 2.6.14.2 and recompiled it 
and had no issues. What I am strugling is trying to create an rpm out of it 
for my Fedora C1 box. This is a clean new kernel compile and have already 
patched the kernel so if anyone has a spec file out there than can share will 
be great. 
Please copy me on the reply as I am not in the list.
Best regards to all for your work and efforts.
Paul
