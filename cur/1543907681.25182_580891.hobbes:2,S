Hi Andi,
Thanks for all the comments, it's greatly appreciated.

Noted. Do you have a better idea? Something like SETSTACK_SWAPGS_SYSRETQ?

Glauber will need to address this, this is his code ;-)

The paravirt ops struct points to it.

The reason for this change is because of the added:
#ifdef CONFIG_PARAVIRT
	INTERRUPT_RETURN
ENTRY(native_iret)
#endif
If we are paravirt ops, we need the iretq in the exception table, not the
paravit ops function call.  Since that function call may simply call the
native_iretq, and if we take a fault at the iretq, it wont be in the
exception table.

Glauber, that comment is for you.

OK, bad name then. How about SWAPGS_UNTRUSTED_STACK?
From earlier in the file where SWAPGS_NOSTACK is declared we have:
/* Currently paravirt can't handle swapgs nicely when we
 * don't have a stack.  So we either find a way around these
 * or just fault and emulate if a guest tries to call swapgs
 * directly.
 *
 * Either way, this is a good way to document that we don't
 * have a reliable stack.
 */
#define SWAPGS_NOSTACK		swapgs

Probably not, but this part of the code I don't fully understand. But just
doing this doesn't break lguest.  But perhaps it only did not break it yet
;-)
