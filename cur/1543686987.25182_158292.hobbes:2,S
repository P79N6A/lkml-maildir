Subject: 2.6.0-test3 latest bk hangs when enabling IO-APIC

Hello,
latest bk of 2.6.0-test3 hangs with these three lines:
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
Setting 2 in the phys_id_present_map
...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 2 ... ok.
And there it stays forever. 2.6.0-test3 worked like a charm. This is a
Asus CUV265-DLS motherboard. Dual P3.
Should I file a bugreport at bugzilla?
Best regards,
Stian
