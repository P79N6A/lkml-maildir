+		string '  Default resume device name'
+		depends on SUSPEND2
+		---help---
+		  You normally need to add a resume2= parameter to your lilo.conf or
+		  equivalent. With this option properly set, the kernel has a value
+		  to default. No damage will be done if the value is invalid.
+
+	config SUSPEND2_KEEP_IMAGE
+		bool '  Allow Keep Image Mode'
+		depends on SUSPEND2
+		---help---
+		  This option allows you to keep and image and reuse it. It is intended
+		  __ONLY__ for use with systems where all filesystems are mounted read-
+		  only (kiosks, for example). To use it, compile this option in and boot
+		  normally. Set the KEEP_IMAGE flag in /proc/suspend2 and suspend.
+		  When you resume, the image will not be removed. You will be unable to turn
+		  off swap partitions (assuming you are using the swap writer), but future
+		  suspends simply do a power-down. The image can be updated using the
+		  kernel command line parameter suspend_act= to turn off the keep image
+		  bit. Keep image mode is a little less user friendly on purpose - it
+		  should not be used without thought!
