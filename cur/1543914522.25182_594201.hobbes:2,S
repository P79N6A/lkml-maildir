Adrian, what's the point of answering your questions, WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN 
READ THE ANSWERS!
So stop repeating your inane question, and instead LISTEN to what people 
are saying.
There is *no* requirement what-so-ever on user space. End of story.
If user-space doesn't tell devices to go to autosuspend, they just won't 
do so. But this has nothing to do with white-lists, black-lists, 2.6.43, 
or your HAL version.
That black-listing was a mistake. We got over it. Now PLEASE you get over 
it too!
