Hello,
I tried to reproduce this bug by mounting/unmounting the drive several 
times.
It seems like this problem is caused, if the drive is at speed 0 after 
some time without access. In this situation, sometimes the drive seems 
to take a bit longer to speed up. Whenever it takes a bit longer, I get 
the error in dmesg and parts of the mounted disc are unreadable...
Any chance to get this debugged?
CU
Manuel
