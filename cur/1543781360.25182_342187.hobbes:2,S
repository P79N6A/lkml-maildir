This was interesting.  At first, lots of kernels just kept working,
I almost suspected I was doing something wrong. Then the second last kernel
recompiled a lot of DRM stuff - and the crash came back!
The kernel after that worked again, and so the final message was:
561fb765b97f287211a2c73a844c5edb12f44f1d is first bad commit

    [PATCH] ppc64: topology API fix
    
    Dont include asm-generic/topology.h unconditionally, we end up overriding
    all the ppc64 specific functions when NUMA is on.

I'm a little surprised, as a ppc64 fix theoretically shouldn't matter for 
x86_64? But perhaps they share something?
I hope this is of help,
