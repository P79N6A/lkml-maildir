You miss nothing I think. In fact it's already used (see below)

That just would allow nasty starvation, e.g. when someone runs a cpu intensive
screensaver or a seti-at-home.

For a lot of reader cases non-preemption by threads is guaranteed anyways -- 
e.g.  anything that runs in interrupts, timers, tasklets and network softirq.  
I think that already covers a lot of interesting cases.
