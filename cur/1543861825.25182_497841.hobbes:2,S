As I'm ignorant with regard to what is needed for "compliant"
support of O_DIRECT on tmpfs, what are the issues with actually implementing
the proper semantics, including the alignment and any transfer length
restrictions?
My $.02 is that the implementation should be fully compliant with the
current semantics or it shouldn't be implemented.  And I think it should
be implemented.
