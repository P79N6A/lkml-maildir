Bad news.  It hangs when I do the usual stress test:
echo 1 > THM0/polling_frequency
sleep.sh
sleep.sh
The second sleep.sh hangs going to sleep.  It is in an endless loop
printing the following line, once per second (from the
polling_frequency):
  Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._TMP] (Node c157bf88)
> Please also make sure you have vanilla DSDT
$ grep DSDT /boot/config-2.6.16-rc5.fake-thermal_active+passive
# CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT is not set
> vanilla Kernel, and just hacked acpi_thermal_active/passive.
Only diff between pristine 2.6.16-rc5 tree and mine is:
