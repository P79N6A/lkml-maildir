Bad idea if running with root mounted over NFS for example.
The fact that a complete running system does in some way depend
on /proc beeing mounted is bad in itself too. This is mainly
due to the fact that all the strongly kernel
tangled userland utilities in linux are maintained separately
from the kernel source tree, and are in most cases poorly written
or maintained. (Ever took a look at the procps utils for example,
ever counted the #if KERNEL_VERSION >= in utils-linux?)
If one looks  at the stuff there you can find that there far too many 
/proc entries out there, which are never used or unneccessary, becouse the
attitude for the kernel beceame over the years too
be: "I don't know what to do about this parameter, oh no problem
lets make it a proc entry..." And in most cases the next step
is to invent some ugly, hardly parsable intermixed binary/text,
special, undocumented format for the new pseudo 
files there, which will change with every
couple of minor kernel releases, instead of a IOCTRL or therelike.
Oh and never forget to promise to write some userland utlities
which will provide an "clean" interface for this stuff. And of course
never do it (see ide/proc, and others...)
But nobody really  cares becouse nobody is really using it other then
cat /proc/interrupts cat /proc/devices during the boxes 
first time setup...
