<asm/segment.h> doesn't describe any part of the user/kernel ABI, so
we should be OK to kill it.  I would say we should remove the ppc and
ppc64 versions of it once 2.6.13 is out, and offer the other arch
maintainers a patch that moves their stuff as you suggest.  I think
also we could submit patches to remove the places where it is included
in generic kernel code post 2.6.13.
