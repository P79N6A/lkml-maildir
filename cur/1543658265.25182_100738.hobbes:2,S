  I want to do bandwidth throttling at the link layer
in a manner similar to netshaper, but am wondering if
the netif_stop_queue functionality can be accessed
from userspace via an ioctl or other means.  That is,
without writing a line of kernel-space code, is there
a way to set the busy flag (tbusy) on a generic
ethernet device from user space?
  Thanks,
  -Lenny
