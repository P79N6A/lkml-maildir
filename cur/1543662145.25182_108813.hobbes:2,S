This change broke the compilation of sim710.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
  gcc -Wp,-MD,drivers/scsi/.sim710.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude -Wall 
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common 
-pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=k6 
-Iinclude/asm-i386/mach-default -nostdinc -iwithprefix include    
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=sim710 -DKBUILD_MODNAME=sim710 -c -o 
drivers/scsi/sim710.o drivers/scsi/sim710.c
drivers/scsi/sim710.c:329: `sim710_device_remove' undeclared here (not in a function)
drivers/scsi/sim710.c:329: initializer element is not constant
drivers/scsi/sim710.c:329: (near initialization for `sim710_eisa_driver.driver.remove')
drivers/scsi/sim710.c:330: initializer element is not constant
drivers/scsi/sim710.c:330: (near initialization for `sim710_eisa_driver.driver')
make[2]: *** [drivers/scsi/sim710.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
This is the only occurence of sim710_device_remove in the whole kernel 
tree.
