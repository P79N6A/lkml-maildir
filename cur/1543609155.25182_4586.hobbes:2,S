There are no such devices in use in our machines. This is happening on 3
Compaq servers, and each has a similar configuration. A Compaq ML370,
1G RAM, a Compaq Smart Array 431 RAID controller, and some Dialogic
telephony cards.
I don't have one of these machines running without telephony cards, to 
see if that has any significance.The only external interfaces we use are 
the LAN, one of the serial ports, and the phone lines connected to the 
Dialogic cards. The SCSI controller is idle, as the disks are on the 
RAID controller. The IDE interface has a CD-ROM on it..
 From what you say, it sounds like the ServerWorks chipset may well have 
a timer bug. This machine uses the LE 3.0 chipset.

Steve
