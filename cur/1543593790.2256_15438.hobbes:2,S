Take for examples the motherboards with temperature sensors on them. At
some point it will display the temperature of the motherboard. This rises
questions: The motherboard will not have the same temeprature in two
distinct points. The temperature will be highere where there are presne
some thermistors or transistors that need cooloing and have a heatsink on
top of them. So, where are the sensors on the motherboard put ? I don't
think that there are a lot of them and then to display the average
temperature. This would be a stupid thing to do.  You want to know the
temperature of the motherboard for different resons. If you have a case
that it is sealed by the manufacturer and cannot keep it open to allow the
components to cooldown when things get hot inside or outside (in the
summer), you will have to rely on the motherboard sensors. And if it
happens to have in your computer some graphics card that generates a lot
of heat (like a Voodoo 2, or GeForce without a cooler), a TV tunner,
some of the heat generated will be passed on to the motherboard. And some
motherboard manufacturers insert beetween PCI/ISA slots different
componenents that can be affected by the heat generated by the cards in
the slots. And your confidence in the sensors in the motherboard
disapperas. The only thing you can trust nowadays is the one that messures
the temperature of the CPU (not very accurate). We can talk about accuracy
of temperature measurment when the sensors inside our computer get as good
as those used in a laboratory. Untill then ...

I haven't encountered any CPU with builtin temperature sensors.
