I would like to find out if rlimit64 is supported by Linux 2.6. It 
doesn't seem to be supported by 2.4, the default kernel for RHEL3. I 
also cannot seem to find any specific information regarding 64-bit 
rlimit anywhere on the net, except a 3-year old page saying rlimit64 is 
not implemented properly.
I am in need of using 64-bit values for rlimit and if Linux doesn't, 
which UNIX system (preferably OSS) would anyone consider as having a 
stable implementation of it.
Regards,
Carlo
