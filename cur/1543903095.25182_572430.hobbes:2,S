No, no, I didn't mean any significant output. You changed itimer_delete()

This change should not help, lock_timer() should always succeed here.
But since it makes a difference, we can make something like
	if (lock_timer(timer->it_id, &flags) == NULL) {
		printk("Impossible! but it happened.\n");
		return;
	}
The same for posix_timer_fn().
I still can't believe we have a double-free problem, this looks imposiible.
Do you see the
	"idr_remove called for id=%d which is not allocated.\n"
in syslog?
Could you try the patch below? Perhaps we have some wierd problem with
->sigq corruption.
Oleg.
