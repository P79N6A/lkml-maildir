What's wrong with 
#!/bin/env perl
or even
: # -*-Perl-*-
eval 'exec perl -w -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
        if 0;
I write all my perl scripts like that (I picked up the tricks from the
XEmacs developers list).
Now you only have to fix the incorrect path to 'env' on Linux, it should
be in /bin not /usr/bin, because /bin is where you will find it on 
IRIX, AIX, Solaris and everywhere I looked.
