That's what I was thinking about too. Although I don't know if it
needs hacks. It may work as is.

If Alexey's 2.2 "tc" is anything like Alan's 2.0 "shaper" then I
thought it did the best and only decent way of shaping: dropping
packets on the floor so that TCP treats it like congestion. The other
part of the plan was to use Alexey's new routing stuff to simulate
lots of separate bandwidth-limited clients on one box. Allocate the
whole box a good chunk of the 10/8 network, and use
route-by-source-address to route each one via a separate tc qdisc.
Then the client side of the benchmark consists of forking a lot, each
child creates and binds a socket to its own 10.x.y.z address and the
magic of iproute2+tc will make each one into its own low bandwidth
connection. There's so much that's tweakable in the new routing engine
that I'd guess we could simulate plenty of slow clients fairly
realistically.
