Mount the server rsize=wsize=8192.  `cp' a 102,400,000 byte file
from the NFS server to /dev/null.  The file is fully cached on
the server.  unmount and remount the server between runs
to eliminate client caching. The copy takes 8.654 seconds.  That's
11.8 megabytes/sec.
Client is 2.4.1-vanilla:                   29.8% CPU
Client is 2.4.1-zc:                        28.2% CPU
Client is 2.4.1-zc, non-SG+xsum NIC:       27.7% CPU
So I was mistaken - there is an improvement. (A 2% CPU
change is easily measurable with this setup).
It may be a little better than this - cyclesoak I think
will underestimate the benefit of saving on memory traffic.
It only generates 10,000 cacheline writebacks per second per
CPU.  But winding it up to 80,000 doesn't affect the above
figures much at all.
The box has 130 mbyte/sec memory write bandwidth, so saving
a copy should save 10% of this.   (Wanders away, scratching
head...)
