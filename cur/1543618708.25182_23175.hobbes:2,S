Why would anyone want to write   if (X==false) or if (X==true) ?
It is the "beginner's mistake" way of writing code.  Then people learn,
and write if (X) or if (!X).  Comparing to true/false is silly.
Nobody writes  if ( (a==b) == true) so why do it in the simpler cases?

A switch statement on a boolean value is stupid.  Use if - there
is only two cases.
