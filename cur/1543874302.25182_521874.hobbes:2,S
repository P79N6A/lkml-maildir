Hello!
> This might work. Could you post a patch to better show what you mean to do?
Here it is.
->neigh_destructor() is killed (not used), replaced with ->neigh_cleanup(),
which is called when neighbor entry goes to dead state. At this point
everything is still valid: neigh->dev, neigh->parms etc.
The device should guarantee that dead neighbor entries (neigh->dead != 0)
do not get private part initialized, otherwise nobody will cleanup it.
I think this is enough for ipoib which is the only user of this thing.
Initialization private part of neighbor entries happens in ipib
start_xmit routine, which is not reached when device is down.
But it would be better to add explicit test for neigh->dead
in any case.
