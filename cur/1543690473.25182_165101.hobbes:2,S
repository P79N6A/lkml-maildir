Hmm, *good* question.  Think...
Ah, it's because when someone's waiting for the reference count to hit
zero, we wake them *every* time we decrement.  With the reference
count spread across every cpu, it's the only way:
 static inline void module_put(struct module *module)
 {
 	if (module) {
 		unsigned int cpu = get_cpu();
 		local_dec(&module->ref[cpu].count);
 		/* Maybe they're waiting for us to drop reference? */
 		if (unlikely(!module_is_live(module)))
 			wake_up_process(module->waiter);
 		put_cpu();
 	}
 }
This doesn't really fit with a completion, unfortunately.

I'm not sure either: really depends on kobject usage.  I was thinking
struct netdevice.  The size for UP is the same, the size for SMP is
ptr + sizeof(int) + sizeof(atomic_t)*NR_CPUs.

Cheers,
