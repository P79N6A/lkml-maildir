It's useful, but the other case is more important.

Until inotify and dnotify work on /proc/12345/task, there really isn't
an alternative for some of us. Polling is unusable.
Ideally one could pick any container, session, process group,
mm, task group, or task for notification of state change.
State change means various things like destruction, addition
of something new, exec, etc. (stuff one can see in /proc)
With appropriate privs, having the debug-related stuff would be
good as well.
