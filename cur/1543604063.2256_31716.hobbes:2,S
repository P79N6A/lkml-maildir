I've discussed this with you before and you continue to have
completely missed the point.
Alpha requires that you issue read-after-read memory barriers on
the reader side if you require ordering between reads.  That is
the extent of the weakness of the memory ordering.
Sparc64 is the same way.
This crap will never be applied.  Your algorithms are simply broken
if you do not ensure proper read ordering via the rmb() macro.
