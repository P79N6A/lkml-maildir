I think it can, as long as the volatile reference cannot alias the
non-volatile reference.  Volatile references aren't general memory
barriers per se, just some form of side effect.  IMHO they can even be
reordered wrt to each other if no sequence point occurs between them.

That's defined by the C standard.
