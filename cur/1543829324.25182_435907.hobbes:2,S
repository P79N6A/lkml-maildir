I meant exporting the GDT page

The current mechanism doesn't scale to much more calls, but I guess
i'll have to do a vDSO sooner or later.

It already does.

One proposal (not fully fleshed out was) number of siblings / sockets / nodes 
I don't think bitmaps would work well there (and if someone really needs
those they can read cpuinfo again) 
This is mostly for OpenMP and tuning of a few functions (e.g. on AMD
the memory latencies varies with the number of nodes so some functions
can be tuned in different ways based on that)

The problem with exposing too much is that it might be a nightmare
to guarantee a stable ABI for this. At least it would
constrain the kernel internally. Probably less is better here. 
Also I'm still not sure why user space should care about interrupts?
