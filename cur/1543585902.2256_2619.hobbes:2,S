Release 0.9.7: Mon Mar 26 16:55:48 EST 2001
	* Can now configure everything except the CONFIG_-less CRIS symbols.
	* Prefix-stripping for backward compatibility with, e.g. CONFIG_3C515.
	* Resolve all FIXMES, including Andre Hedrick's IDE vendor stuff.
CML2 can now configure symbols with leading numerics, removing the
last remaining CML1 compatibility problem.  Once the CRIS-architecture
symbols are brought into conformance with the CML1 spec, CML2 will
be able to completely configure a stock kernel tree.  All known gaps
in the CML1 translation have been fixed.

The abortion rights and gun control debates are twin aspects of a deeper
question --- does an individual ever have the right to make decisions
that are literally life-or-death?  And if not the individual, who does?
