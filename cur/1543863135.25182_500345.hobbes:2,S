	I agree with the majority view that using the term 'MB' or 'GB' to mean a
million or a billion bytes is inaccurate. The way RAM and flash are measured
is correct. The way disk manufacturers advertise disk capacity is simply
*wrong*. There is no word for a million bytes. There is no word for a
billion bytes.

	Talk about a cure worse than the disease! So you're saying that 256MB flash
cards could be advertised as having 268.4MB? A 512MB RAM stick is
mislabelled and could correctly say 536.8MB? That's just plain craziness.
	Adopting IEC 60027-2 just replaces a set of well-understood problems with
all new problems.
	DS
