Perhaps if you looked at this outside of a file-server scenario, the
problem would be clearer? Anti-malware companies want to check
anything written to disk on a system, either at write time or blocking
the open/mmap. That means proactively protecting email programs with
known vulnerabilities that have yet to be patched, web browsers
writing and reading their caches, an Apache instance running WebDAV,
the list goes on. And these are on desktop systems, with no attached
file/network server.
Yes, each and every one of these programs could have a malware
scanning engine slapped inside of them. But that proves what? That's
like saying each an every program on a system should have the SELinux
policies built into them, and yet we have that in-kernel instead.
