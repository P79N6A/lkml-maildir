Hi all,
Currently, HOWTO and stable_api_nonsense.txt are included in 
Documentation/"each country"/ as policy documents.
Greg K-H said the following in this thread:

)

SubmittingPatches document includes important information 
about how to generate patch and write e-mail related to kernel 
development.
So, I wish SubmittingPatches is included in Documentation/"each country"/ 
as policy documents.
How do you think about this?
I attach two patches(one fixes a typo, the other adds SubmittingPatches 
translated into Japanese to Documentation/ja_JP directory).
These patches are for linux-2.6.23.
The translated SubmittingPatches has already been reviewed by JF project.
JF project is the Japanese equivalent of LDP.
Your comments are very welcome.
