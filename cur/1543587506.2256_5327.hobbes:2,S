I found the difference which causes this.  If I build my kernel with
IP_PNP (IP: kernel level autoconfiguration) support I get a defunt thread
for each 8139too device.  If I don't build with IP_PNP support I don't get
any, defunct ethernet threads.
This make any sense?  Here is the relevant diff from a working config to a
bad one:
[root@stewart-nw34 conf]# diff -u config-p5-good config-p6-bad
