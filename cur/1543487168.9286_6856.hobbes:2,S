There will always be a delay between loading the module and setting the
levels.  Both cannot physically happen at the same time unless you have a
sound card which can have its mixer settings set in the same I/O cycle
as the activation of the card.
What you want is for there to be no time at which the sound card mixer
settings are set to a value which is neither the value before the sound
module was loaded nor the value after the mixer levels are set for the
first time.
If the mixer settings default to zero when the card initializes, then we
have this timeline:
	System start				soundcard is not activated
	Linux kernel loaded			soundcard is not activated
	Linux kernel boots			soundcard is not activated
	Linux kernel execs /sbin/init		soundcard is not activated
	/sbin/init runs				soundcard is not activated
	until the sound init script		soundcard is not activated
	sound script loads sound module		soundcard is silent
	sound script sets mixer volumes		soundcard is non-silent
In that timeline there is a delay between loading the module and setting
the mixer levels.  However, if we assume that the sound module initializes
all sound levels to silence, then there is no change in mixer levels between
the time before the sound module is loaded and after the mixer levels is
set.
Is that sufficient?
