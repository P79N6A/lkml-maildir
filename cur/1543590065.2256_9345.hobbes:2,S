Hello listers,
as of yesterday I started to get random hard lockups. It was strange
because just before that I've never had one ... MB worked just fine
for now about two months. Until yesterday ...
I tried to boot 2.4.3-ac14, 2.4.4, 2.4.4-ac4 ... the same. Btw. I have
ACPI enabled, so sometimes I see lots of defunc processes 
kacpidpc defunct ... and that number keeps growing. Ok, I see that new
kernel might misbehave but for example 2.4.3-ac14 used to work as charm
and there I see the same ... tons of defunc processes ... until fork:
resource temporary unavailable error ...
So that's not the kernel (my guess.). Last night I booted up win 98 to
play unreal tournament. Then booted back to linux ... and there we go
I hit strange pile of the problems and I don't know how to deal with them.
Tinkered for a while. Disable acpi or so ... trying to recompile kernels
- random lock ups. Sometimes it works fine for longer time sometimes it
hangs much faster ... most of time I saw kacpidpc defuncs ...
Yet later 5am. in the morning I gave up. ... But then I realized that win 98
did something ... lets try clean up BIOS'es (with jumper). Now it works just
fine again as it used to ... 
Now I don't have a clue as to what was wrong ?
Win98 reprograms hardware ? and linux can't handle it in this "win98" state ?
Looks like it :(
No Ooops. Just plain hard lock up. No cpu not overclocked. Latest BIOS version.
