I quote from the version in linux-2.4.2-ac22
"
Now, the initrd can be unmounted and the memory allocated by the RAM
disk can be freed:
# umount /initrd
# blockdev --flushbufs /dev/ram0    # /dev/rd/0 if using devfs
"
I guess I assumed the above has to be put in /linuxrc as it follows other 
commands which do go in the /linuxrc. The assumption is not quite correct as I 
have since found out.
