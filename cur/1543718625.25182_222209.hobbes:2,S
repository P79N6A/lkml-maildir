You mean like when a user does a malloc() and the memory is not physically
allocated because not used yet ? or even in case memory has been swapped
out ? I believe I begin to understand, but the corner case is not really
clear to me. It yet seems strange to me that the user can reference memory
areas that the kernel cannot access. I'm certainly mistaken somewhere, but
I don't know where. In fact, if you could give me a simple example which
puts my original code at fault, it would really help me. Then I'll change
the code as suggested by Andrew but at least I would understand what I do.
Thanks in advance.
Willy
