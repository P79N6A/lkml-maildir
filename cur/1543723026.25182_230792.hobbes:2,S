But then I'd have to modify the kernel.  I'd rather just use a loadable
module or user-space driver.

The problem appears to be that the BIOS did not assign PCI addresses to
the two devices.  Linux (2.6.3-4mdkenterprise) then did so, but it
starts assigning at either 256MB, or the first 1MB aligned page after
the end of DRAM, whichever is higher.  On my 1GB system with "mem=768M",
this the region of my "reserved" DRAM.
So, using "mem=" to reserve DRAM and having Linux assign PCI addresses
are not compatible.
