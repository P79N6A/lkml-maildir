(not a lawyer, etc, etc.  Just a LKML lurker.)
As I understand it, these things depend on the size of the changes.  For
example, in the world of publishing, an editor may change spellings and
phrases, even add or remove entire paragraphs, but does not gain any
rights over the work by doing so.
If there was argument about this, deciding where the line is between a
edit and new work would be up to a court, no doubt.  If I was deciding
it, changes to fit ReiserFS into a new VFS structure or fixing a locking
bug would be a "edit", while adding a new Reiser4 plugin or a more
efficient hash function would be "new work."
