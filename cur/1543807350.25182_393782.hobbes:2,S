Now I can mount CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+RW using pktcdvd.
Something strange happend when I copied files to DVD+RW und used eject.
After some time eject exitet, but the disc was stil in the burner, I was
allowed to open it by pressing the eject button, but then:
hda: media error (bad sector): status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: media error (bad sector): error=0x34 { AbortedCommand LastFailedSense=0x03
}
ide: failed opcode was: unknown

end_request: I/O error, dev hda, sector 4546116
end_request: I/O error, dev hda, sector 4546124

end_request: I/O error, dev hda, sector 4546164
end_request: I/O error, dev hda, sector 4546172
Buffer I/O error on device pktcdvd0, logical block 1136528
lost page write due to I/O error on pktcdvd0
And also many messages like this:
pktcdvd: Unknown ioctl for pktcdvd0 (5326)
I have no more free time to test if the disc is OK, but I think it is,
since it's new and was written only few times.
Writing to CD-RW and umounting it gave no errors.
When inserting CD-R I get:
pktcdvd: Wrong disc profile (9)
pktcdvd: pktcdvd0 failed probe
but everything works OK.
