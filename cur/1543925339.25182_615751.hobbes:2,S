Setup: FC6 system with MM snapshot broken-out-2007-11-06-02-32 and these two
patches added:
r-o-bind-mounts-track-number-of-mount-writer-fix-buggy-loop.patch
r-o-bind-mounts-track-number-of-mount-writer-fix-buggy-loop-checkpatch-fixes.patch
All I do is  boot the system with said kernel, wait a few seconds, then shut
it down with "init 0".  As services shutdown, I get this:
Stopping RPC idmapd:

Stopping NFS statd: BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual
address 6b6b6b6b.
EIP is at kobject_uevent_env+0x3c/0x399 which was called from
kobject_uevent, called from remove_user_sysfs_dir, run_workqueue,
worker_thread, kthread, kernel_thread_helper.
After that there are several other oopses (eg. during unmount of pipefs),
but I don't know how much to believe them given the first 1-2.  Sorry I
don't have a cut-n-paste of the precise stack trace, but if anyone's
interested, I have a short video file of the shutdown sequence w/ all of the
oopses.
Erez.
