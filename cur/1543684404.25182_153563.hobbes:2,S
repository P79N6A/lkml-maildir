no. In 2.4 there are (and/or can be) all sorts of assumptions about
TIMER_BH being serialized with other bh contexts (eg. the serial bh),
that's why i added the TIMER_BH logic to the 2.4 timer-scalability patch.  
You cannot just remove TIMER_BH. The way we did it in 2.5 was to remove
_all_ bhs and thus all assumptions about serialization. This is not an
option for 2.4 in any case.
