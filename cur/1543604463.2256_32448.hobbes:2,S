When trying to load a reiserfs enabled boot disk on a Dell PowerEdge 
I get:
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeimg unused kernel memory: 192k freed
(hangs here) 
The problem appears on 2.4.11-pre6 and 2.4.12 but 2.4.9 was fine.
This problem appears both whith and without the Dell AACraid patches.
