Subject: [PATCH] module_author: don't advice putting in an email address

Hi Rusty.
Following up the recent MODULE_MAINTAINER discussion:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/4/170
that concluded with MODULE_MAINTAINER not being a good idea, here's a small 
patch that just deletes the advice of including an email address in the 
MODULE_AUTHOR tag as suggested (and not objected to) at the end of it.
The email address is the problem I was trying to fix; with multiple current 
and non-current authors and maintainers who might not even be authors the 
address(es) available from the tag confuse the issue of whom to contact. 
It's moreover also information that easily outdated.
A bit more than half of the tags in the tree don't include an email address 
already and I'll submit patches removing more...
Rene.

    module_author: don't advice putting in an email address
    It's information that's easily outdated and easily mistaken for
    a driver contact which is a problem especially for modules with
    multiple current and non-current authors as well as for modules
    with a maintainer who may not even be a module author.
