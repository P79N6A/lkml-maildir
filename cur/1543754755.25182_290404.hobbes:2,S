With presented design we already have above links.
Each superio chip has a list of chain objects, each of which points to
the connected logical device.
Logical device usage must be done using provided logical device methods
(like read/write/control).
From that point of view noone even knows, that above GPIO0 and GPIO1 
(on the picture) are actually the same object(if they are not clones,
but if they are, then picture becomes 100% real).

I can not agree that it is a bus.
Bus abstraction can be _only_ applied to hierarchy in the only one
superio chip.
