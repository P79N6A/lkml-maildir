Subject: unload compiled-in module?

We now have __init and __initdata which is very handy.  Next step:  is
it possible to conditionally jettison entire modules?  Something like
	if (extra_feature)
		extra_feature_init (); /* found in another module */
	else
		module_unneeded("extra_module");
		/* tell kernel to free memory associated with this compiled-in module
*/
This could potentially save a bunch of memory for certain areas of
compiled kernels.
Regards,
	Jeff
