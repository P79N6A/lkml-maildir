do_div() is actually defined in terms of u64, not unsigned long long. 
Although afaict this will all work OK and all the usual type promotions
will dtrt.
Which begs the question: how _does_ the kernel represent nanoseconds?  The
time-management code is a bit undecided (search for long long in
posix-cpu-timers.c, and for u64 in hrtimers.c).  All a bit confused.
Anwyay.  This function is too big and slow to be inlined..
