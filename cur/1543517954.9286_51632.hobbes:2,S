What I am trying to get across is that binary portable modules help 
to solve driver compatibility problems when you do new releases of 
the Linux kernel. I am not trying to say that the source code should 
be closed. Obviously the Open Source nature of the NCR 5380 driver is 
what allows it to continue to be supported.
Binary portable drivers are important to ensure compatibility between 
builds of the Linux kernel. If you don't have some kind of binary 
driver mechanism, regression tests and well designed device driver 
API's, every time you recompile the Linux kernel you may well 
introduce new problems that need to be fixed. 
I am however not sure it is worth continuing to argue this anymore, 
because I don't think anyone developing for the Linux kernel really 
understand these issues. Everyone seems to keep regurgitating the 
classic reasons for advocating Open Source, instead of understanding 
that I am talking about methodologies to help solve compatibility 
problems with the existing Open Source drivers.

And that is a good thing. I am glad to know that mechanism exists in 
Linux. But how many people actually have multiple gcc revisions 
installed on their systems so they can do repeatable rebuilds of the 
kernel?
One thing that has always bugged me is that when I get a new Red Hat 
distribution, I can compile the kernel sources that come with it and 
expect that it will probably work as well as the pre-built kernels 
that came with in the box. However if I upgrade my compiler, upgrade 
my kernel sources and start upgrading random pieces that Red Hat has 
not specifically tested, then it all starts to fall apart. How can I 
feel confident that it will really work, when the vendor I pay money 
for support can't possibly have tested my particular configuration?
The only solution of course is to stick with the official Red Hat 
distribution and only do official upgrades. But then I can't reliably 
take advantage of a new device driver until Red Hat gets around to a 
new version.

We will do that for what small things we need in the Linux kernel for 
our products. But what if I build a mechanism that will allow for 
this to be done even for Open Source projects? Last time we spoke via 
email you indicated that such patches would never be accepted into 
the Linux kernel.
