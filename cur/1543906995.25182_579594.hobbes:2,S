except that you get a 20ms minimum, and 10ms increment.

so? you provide the best possible for the config options selected...

that's... combining 2 independent things into one. That's not a really
good idea.

msleep() isn't about timers. The timer type used is an implementation
detail behind the interface!!!!
Timers are course resolution that is highly HZ-value dependent. For
cases where you want a finer resolution, the kernel now has a way to
provide that functionality... so why not use the quality of service this
provides..

no but they DO provide a much better quality of the api implementation;
instead of a 20ms timeout you get really close to what you asked for!
There have been drivers that did if (HZ<1000) mdelay(x); else msleep(x);
Yes that's horrible, but it's a clear sign that this matters.

ehm it was you who insisted on adding complexity to this; the initial
proposal was to just replace the msleep() implementation with one that
has a more gentle behavior (you ask for 1ms you get 1ms, not 20ms)
What really is your problem with that? "It may be more expensive on some
hardware?"
