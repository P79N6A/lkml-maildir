By now, it's only used by a minority (those, who get it going reliably),
but I bet, things change, when 2.6 is out. I would love and even celebrate
once swsuspend is working via nbd for my diskless setups. I consider
this as a real quantum leap (from a usability/energy saving point of view).
The question is: why is the VM not able to fulfill such a simple need in
a clean way?
