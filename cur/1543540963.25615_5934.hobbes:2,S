Subject: NWFS readpage() in 2.2.X -- after_unlock_page() not exported

I am finishing the mmap() problems in NWFS and have tracked down the
shared library problem:
BUG IN DYNAMIC LINKER:  ld.so:  trld.c assertion () 
that shows up when building the linux source tree from an NWFS volume. 
The basic problem is in the page cache interface and some interface
problems there.   There were also some concurrency problems with the VFS
serializing access from multiple instances of 'sh' being invoked from
the make utility above the FS.  I have had to implement my own
readpage() function for this to work right since brw_page will copy data
between the page cache and buffer cache and end up double buffering data
between the NWFS LRU and the buffer cache.  I was under the assumption
that readpage() and it's related functions were submitting page cache
memory for direct IO rather than copy between the two, but after
reviewing this in detail, I have discovered that this copying is going
on, which means that there are cases where the Linux buffer cache can
buffer blocks that I have flagged dirty or changed in the NWFS LRU,
causign data inconsistencies.
The obvious solution is to hook the page cache interface and redirect
all the "copying" activity to the NWFS LRU.  This is very
straightforward and simple on 2.4.X since the architecture has been
improved to allow this stuff in the page cache interface in 2.4,X.
2.2.X has hit a serious obstacle.  The function brw_page() has a dirty
hook into the VM labeled after_unlock_page() that monkeys with the VM
and swaps then frees the page.  This function is not exported, which
results in my readpage() function sucking up all the memory in the
system.  Is there a way around this?  I tried not incrementing the
page->count field and the problem persists.   The reapage() function is
attached.  With this fix the Linux kernel build on an NWFS volumes goes
with a hitch (and runs really fast) but evetually runs the system out of
memory.
Code is attached:
 int nwfs_readpage(struct file *file, struct page *page)
{
    struct dentry *dentry = file->f_dentry;
    struct inode *inode = dentry->d_inode;
    register VOLUME *volume = (VOLUME *)inode->i_sb->u.generic_sbp;
    register HASH *hash = inode->u.generic_ip;
    register ULONG block, vindex;
    register LRU *lru;
    int p[PAGE_SIZE / 512];
    register int i;
    BYTE *buffer;
#if (VFS_VERBOSE)
    NWFSPrint("readpage page_size-%d page_offset-%d %s\n", 
                    (int)PAGE_SIZE, 
		    (int)page->offset,
		    hash->Name);
#endif
    atomic_inc(&page->count);
    set_bit(PG_locked, &page->flags);
    clear_bit(PG_uptodate, &page->flags);
    clear_bit(PG_error, &page->flags);
	
    NWLockFile(hash);
    
    for (i=0, block = (page->offset >> 12); i < (PAGE_SIZE >> 12); i++,
block++)
       p[i] = NWFileMapBlock(volume, hash, block * IO_BLOCK_SIZE, 0);
    
    buffer = (BYTE *)page_address(page);
    for (vindex = 0; vindex < (PAGE_SIZE >> 12); vindex++)
    {
       // found a hole or end of file encountered.
       if ((!p[vindex]) || (p[vindex] == -1))
       {
          NWFSSet(&buffer[vindex * IO_BLOCK_SIZE], 0, IO_BLOCK_SIZE);
          continue;
       }
       lru = ReadLRU(&DataLRU, volume, p[vindex], 1, DATA_PRIORITY, 
                    (!vindex ? (PAGE_SIZE >> 12) : 1), 0);
       if (lru)
       {
          if ((lru->bad_bits >> i) & 1)
	  {
             ReleaseLRU(&DataLRU, lru);
	     NWUnlockFile(hash);
             set_bit(PG_error, &page->flags);
             clear_bit(PG_locked, &page->flags);
             wake_up(&page->wait);
             return -EIO;
	  }
          NWFSCopy(&buffer[vindex * IO_BLOCK_SIZE], lru->buffer,
IO_BLOCK_SIZE);
          ReleaseLRU(&DataLRU, lru);
          continue;
       }
       NWUnlockFile(hash);
       set_bit(PG_error, &page->flags);
       clear_bit(PG_locked, &page->flags);
       wake_up(&page->wait);
       return -EIO;
    }
    
    NWUnlockFile(hash);
    set_bit(PG_uptodate, &page->flags);
    clear_bit(PG_locked, &page->flags);
    wake_up(&page->wait);
    return 0;
}
Please advise,
