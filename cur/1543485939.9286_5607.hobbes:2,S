hi,
i'm trying to get access to the inode information 
about a file using the kernel function "namei()".
(actually, i call this function from my system call).
however, it gives me an EFAULT error. if u have 
any idea as to where the problem could be, 
please let me know.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thanks,
Sampath
