HI,
After patching kexec-tools with the kdump patch here's what I did according to 
the test plan:
0. load kernel with crashkernel=64M@16M
1. kexec -p vmlinux --args-linux --append="root=/dev/hda1 init 1" (loads fine)
2. sysrq+c
the system issues here : SysRq: Trigger a crashdump and hangs so that even 
SysRq is dead.
Regards,
Boris.
