Given the recent discussion about the problems of lazy disable I don't believe
the premise of this patch.
Although I suspect the proper solution is to fix free_irq to call ->mask instead
of disable.  If an irq fires in the forest and no one is listening who cares.
After which point this patch would make sense again.
