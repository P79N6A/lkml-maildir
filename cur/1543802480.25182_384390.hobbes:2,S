In that case, there's a mostly automated way of doing that if you read
the last couple lines of git-rebase, using something along the lines
of
      git-format-patch <yours> <linus> | git-am -3 -k

You are right about that, but much of the space (of what workflows are
interesting) is still being explored, and git and the porcelains
reacting to people's interests. So it's still a moving target. A fast
moving target.
