That last one indicates that the node /dev/sch0 doesn't exist on your
system. I can confirm that it doesn't exist on mine, so that wouldn't
surprise me.
If that is the case, you'll need to determine the required major and
minor numbers, then create the node from them.
Michael: Any idea where one might look that sort of information up?
Best wishes from Riley.
