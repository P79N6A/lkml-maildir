My old kmalloc would actually use n+10 bytes if you request n bytes.
As memory comes in pools of powers of two, if you request 64k, you
would acutaly use 128k of memory. If you use "get_free_pages", you'll
not have the overhead, and actually allocate the 64k you need. 
I'm not sure what the slab stuff does...
