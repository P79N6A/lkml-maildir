Yes.

After making the mistake of committing to "master":
	$ git commit ;# oops, to the master
        $ git show-branch origin master read-mostly
	!  [origin] latest update from Linus
         * [master] latest for read-mostly
        --
         * [master] latest for read-mostly
        +* [origin] last update from Linus
you could do this, which would be easier to visualize:
	$ git branch read-mostly ;# may need branch "-f" if exists.
        $ git reset --hard HEAD^ ;# rewind the current head by one.
Which would give you this:
        $ git show-branch origin master read-mostly
	!   [origin] latest update from Linus
         *  [master] latest update from Linus
          ! [read-mostly] latest for read-mostly
        --
          ! [read-mostly] latest for read-mostly
        +*! [origin] last update from Linus
