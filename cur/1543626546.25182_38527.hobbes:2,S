Mike:
Are you sure you want to do this:
-	char		ac_pad[10];		/* Accounting Padding Bytes */
+	__u32		ac_uid32;		/* Accounting Real 32bit User ID */
+	__u32		ac_gid32;		/* Accounting Real 32bit Group ID */
+	char		ac_pad[2];		/* Accounting Padding Bytes */
This changes the size of the accounting structure because the new fields
are padded to 4 byte alignment.
Support for process accounting was part of my original patches for 32 bit
UIDs, but it never got picked up. I think that at the time there was an
expectation that accounting was going to be replaced entirely with new
code (SGI accounting stuff?)
Here's an updated version of my patch:
