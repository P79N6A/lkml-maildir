I believe that in Microsofts tests on 4-processor machines the Linux
server was really slower. Or do you think that Microsoft could compile a
Linux-kernel with SMP support enabled? 
So when Microsoft's tests show a 110% better performance on a 4 way
system that means that Windows NT is 2.1 times as fast with 4 processors
as Linux with only one processor (They forgot to enable SMP before
compiling the kernel, so only one processor was in use).
Greetings, Michael
