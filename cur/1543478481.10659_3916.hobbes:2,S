I have mostly good news, and a small bit of bad news..
The good news is that things seem stable once again, it survived the
test of making the changes to the sound drivers, compiling the sound
modules, testing quickly, then building the kernel (no make clean mind
you, nor config changes, mostly for testing and module management
purposes)..
ac5 and ac6 have not, so hopefully this will be stable..
Now, for the bad news..
I still need to mess with the sound code to get it to give me a fully
working mixer, basicly just removing the case for the ES1788, which is
obviously not the correct answer, but I don't have the chip specs handy,
and its a bit out of my area..
Quick and dirty patch is attached, could you, if all else fails, provide
some way to override the chip detection code without having to tweak the
source and recompile? :/
