Somebody should fix 
http://ww.linuxpowertop.org/known.php
 then, it says:
"The kernels ondemand CPU frequency management function currently has a
high-frequency timer that samples to see if the CPU is idle. Intel fixed this
and the patches to the kernel to effectively remove this timer are included in
Linus' tree as of 2.6.22-rc1."
which confused me no end when I was looking at this stuff and wondering why
it was in the -mm tree if Linus already picked it up. :)
