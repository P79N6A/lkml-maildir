Well, linux/module.h -> asm/module.h -> linux/elf.h.  Although if you
use #define instead of typedef you can break the last link.  Feel free
to send a patch to split it into moduleload.h or something, but I
think it'll look tiny.
But IMHO the nameclash needs to be fixed *anyway*, not hacked around,
or someone else will run over it one day.  AFAICT, changing
fs/binfmt_elf.c and elf.h to AT_RGID is the simplest.  Both should be
mildly chastised for using a prefix like AT_ publically.
Rusty.
