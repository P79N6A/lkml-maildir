Seems a fairly safe assumption that the Linux driver leaves your DVD-ROM in 
a peculiar state then. If you have both drivers compiled in, I believe the 
new PATA driver will "win" (judging by the number of people that lost their 
drives on hda...) so I've added its author to the CC.
Repeating information from your first post:
   Gigabyte gak8nsp (nforce 3)
   NEC DVD-RW@nv_pata
   1x 80 GB WD@nv_sata, 1x 250 GB WD@nv_sata , IBM (20GB) @ nv_pata
Machine hangs at summary screen where it would be trying a boot from DVD 
normally on cold boot, or reboot from Windows. reboot=b doesn't help.
