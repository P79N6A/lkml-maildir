It consisted simply of a list of in/out values. Thats sufficient for
most cards it turned out. It expected the X server to dump the sequence
of values to the kernel.
A BIOS32/ACPI/whatever is currently trendy service to save/restore video
states would actually be a real help to a lot of things. I guess the
perfect would API would support something like
    SaveCurrentMode
    SetMode (some properties)
    GetLinearFBDetails()
    RestoreSavedMode
    LoadColor() [for 8bit modes]
ie roughly what vesa bios provides. Given the cost of executing a
virtual machine like ACPI its less clear if cards could describe
basic acceleration this way, at least if it was something like ACPI
or forth which is hard to compile. A bytecode description that can
be turned into native code obviously has different properties.
