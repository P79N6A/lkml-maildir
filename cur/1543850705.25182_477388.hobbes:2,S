If Jeff is worried about these patches destabilizing UML you can held them out 
for now (but keep in -mm for 2.6.20), that's absolutely fine for me; however 
there are a few real bug fixes for error paths and IMHO they are safe enough 
to merge.

It's just git HEAD, but earlier little patches cause that conflict. 
I am sure that the obvious fixup is correct.
I just gave a look to that hunk in the addition log and it looks ok.
