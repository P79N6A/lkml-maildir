Regarding the sata_promise.c patch, I think I have found a bug in the
interrupt handler:
Just before the 'try_hotplug' label, you provide a check that will
kick us out of the interrupt handler if the interrupt was just handled
by a DMA command completing successfully.
However, I have seen the occasion where a single IRQ is used to signal
both a DMA completion AND a hotplug event.  Of course in this case the
hotplug event itself would be ignored completely.
So I would recommend getting rid of that check entirely.
