Hi Rusty, thanks for the input.
Arnd Bergmann also suggested doing the same thing.  I've slept on this
thought last night and I'm starting to like it more and more.  At least
it seems to be a better solution than some of the things that I've come
up with.
I'll start playing around a little and see what I can do with it.  I
also need to start doing some other work too, so this might take a month
or two to get some results.  So hopefully, I'll have another patch set
in June or July that will be more acceptable.
I'd like to thank all those that responded with ideas and criticisms.
It's been very helpful.
