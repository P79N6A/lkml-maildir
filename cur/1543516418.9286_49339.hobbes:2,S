Hi there,
I've installed 2.3.28, compiled it successfully, and tried to boot from it
- no joy. Hangs on the "Uncompressing ... done. Loading Kernel" (or
whatever the exact text is) stage when booting.
This is an almost clean stock RedHat 6.1 system. Is there something that I
should be upgrading to get this thing to boot?
The machine is a Toshiba Satellite 2540XCDT laptop. 2.2 series kernels run
with no hassles at all.
Thanks
Luke Burton
