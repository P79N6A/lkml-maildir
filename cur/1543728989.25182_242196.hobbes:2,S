I did consider this at some point, but I didn't want to add further 
special cases. Every symbol has a tristate and a string value and so you 
can compare pretty much everything with everything else. Splitting the 
string value further into other types isn't worth the trouble. The problem 
at hand is easy enough to solve by adding a type declaration.
