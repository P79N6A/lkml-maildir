Confirmed. My OpenBSD install copes very well with forkbombs.
However, I _was able_ to spawn a lot of shells by default.
The essence is that the number of processes/threads within
a _session group_ (correct word?) is limited. That way, you can
start a ton of "/bin/sh"s from one another, i.e.:
 \__ login jengelh
     \__ /bin/sh
         \__ /bin/sh
             \__ /bin/sh
...
So I think that if you add a setsid() to your forkbomb,
you could once again be able to bring a system - BSD this time - down.
Just a guess at this time, I would need to write a prog first :p
