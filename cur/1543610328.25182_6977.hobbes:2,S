It should not warn.
Please read ISO C99 5.1.1.2:
2.  Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by a new-line
    character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form logical source lines.
    Only the last backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
    of such a splice. A source file that is not empty shall end in a new-line character,
    which shall not be immediately preceded by a backslash character before any such
    splicing takes place.
This happens even before tokenizing (and before macro expansion too).
