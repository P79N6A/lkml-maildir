What "conclusions"? YOU stated that "They are niced because the user
thinks them a bit less important", and I was only commenting on that.
I've never said your /entire/ algorithm is failing, the point was on
the purpose of the 'nice' level. Users don't use nice to mark less 
important processes. It's completely orthogonal. And if you really
want to correlate nice level and importance, I'd rather say that
niced processes tend to be more important that "normal" processes,
on average.

Ok. Now tell me what's the purpose to run your 'ls' at nice +5 at all.
You nice processes that are going to take a while, otherwise nicing
them has hardly a measurable effect, if any.

'regardless of nice value' is the part I like.

No need. Either reverse the weight you give to nice level or just
ignore it, which probably is easier. I agree that giving a bonus to
niced processed it's nearly useless.
As I've written in my previous message, I don't think it's a big
issue. OOM should not happen, full stop. OOM killer is a last resort
measure, so it needs not to be *too* careful.
