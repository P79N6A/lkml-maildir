Anyway, it would be false security. Any government agency (or IBAS in
Norway) may be able to reconstruct any data on your hd, or they may not.
But you can't know it. So if you _really_ want to have private data on
you computer, strong encryption is the only solution. And be sure that
every temporary file is encrypted!
