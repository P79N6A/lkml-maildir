Hello Steven,

> In commit 76d2160147f43f982dfe881404cfde9fd0a9da21 lazy irq disabling
> was implemented, and the simple irq handler had a masking set to it.
>
> Remy Bohmer discovered that some devices in the ARM architecture
> would trigger the mask, but never unmask it. His patch to do the
> unmasking was questioned by Russell King about masking simple irqs
> to begin with. Looking further, it was discovered that the problems
> Remy was seeing was due to improper use of the simple handler by
> devices, and he later submitted patches to fix those. But the issue
> that was uncovered was that the simple handler should never mask.

> This patch reverts the masking in the simple handler.
