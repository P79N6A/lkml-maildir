Could you please provide a diffstat ?
Me think : "Huge patch, and icache pressure for what exact gain ?"
File descriptor allocation is dust compared to socket setup costs and network 
stuf. (Not speaking of close() wich is O(1) obviously)
If we want a different file descriptor allocation, why should we use a 
parallel structure, and adding one level of complexity ?
Instead of finding the first zero bit in a bitmap, we could just use a cyclic 
allocation, ie finding a zero bit from a 'last' position. Keeping fd_count 
would help not atempting a findzerobit in the case all bits are known to be set.
