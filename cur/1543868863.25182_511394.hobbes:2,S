The Linux device driver model assumes that it owns the hardware. If
this is not true, then should we prevent any non-ACPI driver from
loading as soon as ACPI is enabled?

Yeah, this is correct, and just as unfortunate. It's amazingly sad that
hardware vendors as a whole are still repeating the same design
mistakes over and over again :(

Exactly what I said, you're only rewording it to make it sound nicer ;)

I sure hope we can find a solution, by as your said yourself, nothing
is going to prevent SMM and similar oddities from messing up the drivers
assumptions.
