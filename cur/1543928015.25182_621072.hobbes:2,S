Hi,
Is there a simple way (via a kernel boot option or config setting or -
if really necessary - a patch or something like that) to set the
personality for the init process?  I'm running an x86_64 kernel on a
system whose userland is almost entirely 32-bits (but needs an
occasional 64-bit process to be run, hence the choice of kernel), and
I'd like `uname -m` to be i686 unless I take special action.  So I
think that means letting init (which is indeed a 32-bit process) have
the PER_LINUX32 personality (in case I'm wrong about this, the output
of uname -m is essentially what matters to me).
So, where does the default come from?
