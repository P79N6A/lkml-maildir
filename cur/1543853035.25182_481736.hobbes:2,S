Well, problem is that some notebooks have battery capacity in mAh, and
some in mWh, and you can't convert between those.
We could do something like 
battery_stored_energy and battery_stored_current
                 (mWh)                      (mAh)
...but it looks ugly, and battery_capacity:mAh does not sound that bad
for a new interface.
