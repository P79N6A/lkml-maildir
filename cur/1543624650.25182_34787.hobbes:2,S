 The relevant code is (where possible) marked as __init already.
 So the init code gets thrown away whether needed or not.

 It's not a matter of codesize, it's a correctness issue in the source.
 #ifndef CONFIG_M686 is wrong. It assumes a P6 is the only CPU family
 in existence without the bug, despite the fact there are probably close
 to a dozen others.

 No. You at worse vulnerable to a malicious user running hand-crafted code
 (no compiler generates this code-sequence) bringing down the machine.
 The proposal however was not to remove anything that we currently have.
 Every kernel that is possible to be run on an affected box (i386/i486/i586)
 would still have the workaround present. We just won't generate it in
 Cyrix III, Athlon, Pentium 4, etc kernels..
