For a production release short term solutions like this would be ok, but
the mainline source that will fork off in 2.7 should have the best
design IMHO, and the same for glibc.

this is exactly my point, the fixed address trouble mentioned by Ulirch
make little sense to me because of this (especially in reply to the ldt
part).
and in practice the sysenter instruction is already at a fixed address
in any 2.6 kernel out there (yeah, we could change that number without
breaking glibc, but the attacker won't care less).

I think yes but thinking twice my preferred way is not to pass another
variable address to userspace (that was the first solution that come to
mind, and I wrote that just to show there's no real "fixed address"
trouble). Fixed _offsets_ (not virtual addresses) are perfectly fine
w.r.t. security. So we can just assume the vgettimeofday is at a fixed
offset after the vsysenter code. This should result in the most
efficient code possible while providing flexiblity to the address like
vsysenter does (vgettimeofday will move together with vsysenter).
However it could be the second value in elf is a cleaner way to pass the
vgettimeofday address, I don't mind either ways.
thanks.
