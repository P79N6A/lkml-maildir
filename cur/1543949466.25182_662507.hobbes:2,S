yes - SCHED_BATCH does not modify the CPU usage proportion for 
CPU-intense tasks, it's their nice value that controls the proportion. 
What it will influence is wakeup behavior - i.e. wakeup-intense 
workloads should schedule less with SCHED_BATCH. (but how that is done 
is really fluid and will probably tweaked in the future.)
