   You have to keep track of the significant bits in the dma_addr_t
   regardless of its size, so you put it into your TX descriptor's (or
   what have you) native format that doesn't waste any space.  You don't
   need to keep the full dma_addr_t around.  Perhaps this is just sloppy
   programming?
Some devices keep these in registers and advance them as the
dma progresses.  The only reliable way is by keeping track
of it in software.
   If you don't want to take part in technical discussions, you should
   work in closed source. 8-)
It's not open source, it's "dumb source" I have problems with.
A lot of discussions here end up being of that variety.
