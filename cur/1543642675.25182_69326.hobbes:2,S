Well, if the drive (not the path to it) fails _completely_, it won't be
detected by the md autostart (as it can't find the md superblock).
If it fails completely during runtime, all paths but the last one to it will
be disabled, as a drive failure can't be distinguished from a path failure in
the wonderful 2.4 error handling ;-)
But then, all requests send down the last path will fail, because the target
is broken, not the path.
In short, multipathing doesn't help a bit here; how could it?

I don't understand your question, sorry.
