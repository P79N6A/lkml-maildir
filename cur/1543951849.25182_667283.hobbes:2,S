I like the circus too.

Bah!  So modest.

I agree the page hinting technique is generally useful, even
cross-architecture.
What doesn't appear to be useful however, is support for this under
VMware.  It can be done, even without the writable pte support (yes,
really).  But due to us exploiting optimizations at lower layers, it
doesn't appear that it will gain us any performance - and we must
already have the complex working set algorithms to support
non-paravirtualized guests.

I would say we support it, but I don't expect us to make use of the
infrastructure anytime soon.  For us it would make more sense to use the
swap-fault optimization, but this requires some significant design
changes in our monitor.
Either way, these are both great ideas and I would not want to be held
responsible for blocking their upstream progress.  Someday, with the
evolving x86 architecture (if we ever get per-page dirty bits), they
might make sense for us to do as well.
