No offense taken, and I personally don't have any sort of political
agenda that I care to voice on lkml :). That's part of where the
pragmatism comes in, I just don't care enough.
About every patch I sent here on lkml has been generated by bk for the
past year. I typically don't do commits, just have trees with pending
deltas and bk -r diffs -u does the job for me.

For me, I think Andrew's patch management scripts will do the job. And
yeah, the non-stop bk threads make me sick as well and are rarely read
here. So I better make this my last mail on the subject...
