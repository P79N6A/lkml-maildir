Why do we need a dummy req for plugging.
As i understood only thing plugging does is to, on arrival of new req if
the dev queue is empty, puts a dummy req on the queue, and schedules the
unplug routine on tq_disk, which on being scheduled calls the strategy
routine.
So we can as well put the new req on the queue without dummy req.
If i'm incorrect please explain what's exact process and the reason
Please cc the response to mgopi@indiainfo.com as i'm not subscribed.
thanks
