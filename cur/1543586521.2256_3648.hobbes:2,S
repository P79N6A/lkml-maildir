It looks more like that Acer misimplemented PCI_IRQPIN register - if it
is legacy IDE interface using ports 1F0-1F7/170-177, with IRQs 14 & 15,
it should report zero as IRQ pin. What 'lspci -vx -s 0:f.0' says?
Last four bytes it prints should read 'YY 00 XX XX' - where YY is IRQ
number assigned by BIOS - either hardwired to zero in chip, or just left
alone by BIOS (00 or FF) and next 00 is IRQ pin number - 0 = none, 1 =
A, 
2 = B ... Intel IDE interfaces returns 00 00 here, VIA returns FF 00,
and
I have no hardware with an additional IDE around.
