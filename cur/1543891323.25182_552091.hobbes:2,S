yes, the card can support 64bit DMA transfers. but in this case the
'required' DMA mask returned from dma_get_required_mask() states that a
32bit mask would suffice.
Here's a snippet from the bugzilla report
(
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=219216
):
        QLogic Fibre Channel HBA Driver
        PCI: Enabling device 0000:1f:00.0 (0140 -> 0143)
        ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:1f:00.0[A] -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 16
        qla2xxx 0000:1f:00.0: Found an ISP2432, irq 16, iobase 0xffffc20000020000
        *** qla2x00_config_dma_addressing: required_mask set to 000000007fffffff.
        *** qla2x00_config_dma_addressing: required_mask has no high-dword bits set.
        *** qla2x00_config_dma_addressing: set consistent 64bit mask returned 0.
        *** qla2x00_config_dma_addressing: defaulting to 32bit mask/consistent-mask.
        qla2xxx 0000:1f:00.0: Configuring PCI space...
	Which tells me that a 32bit DMA mask is being set for dma_set_mask()
	and pci_set_consistent_dma_mask() since dma_get_required_mask() is
	returning back 7fffffff -- no upper-dword bits set...
