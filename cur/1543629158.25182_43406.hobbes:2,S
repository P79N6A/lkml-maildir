I'm by no means a BKL expert, not even on TV  :-) , but here is a 
suggestion.
What about a listing sorted by how the BKL should be replaced, 
something like this:
BKL --> dma_spin_lock
- alpha/kernel/ptrace.c  Held while doing a ptrace      (John Doe)
- drivers/block/rd.c  Held while doing whatever         (?)
- ...
BKL --> xprt_lock
- ...
BKL --> no lock required
- ...
BKL instances that will NOT be removed
- ...
The advantage is that it should be easier to group together instances
that require the same type of work.
