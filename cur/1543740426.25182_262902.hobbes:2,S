They really don't seem to matter much. Text is generally a colour expand
fill (ie mono -> colour bitmap expansion) or alpha blended fill.
Stipples and tiles are no big deal and angled lines are used very
little, and are also very cheap because they don't cause any pci fetches
except for weird stuff like xor lines. The main users of those do
horizontal/vertical only which means they are just rectangles...
