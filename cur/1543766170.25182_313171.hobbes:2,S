Fixed the rc2/rc3 IDE Oops myself today that prevented me to test rc2
earlier. It seems the IDE maintainer is currently not very responsive
and I didn't have sufficient spare time to look into this before today :-(
Yes, all problems are already in rc2.

I'll have a look over the weekend.

2.6.11.2 works ok and, yes, its yenta. Some excerpt from lspci:
00:0b.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI7420 CardBus Controller
00:0b.1 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI7420 CardBus Controller

Happens with a probability of about 10% to 20%. I did comment out the
'Too much work...' printk in r8169.c which results in the following
effect: no more message from the network driver (expected), no other
printk related to release_console_sem or anything else unusal, but write
to disk in the case the problem seems to happen is suddenly quite slow
and suspend eventually succeeds.
As the nic driver is built into the kernel insmod/rmmod currently won't
do:-) Nevertheless there doesn't seem to be any strange behaviour after
resume though I didn't really try to use the nic then.
There is, however, definitely no such problem with the nic in 2.6.11.2.
