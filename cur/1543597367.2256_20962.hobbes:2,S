Actually Alan, MAPS notified me a year ago that they were migrating to a 
subscription service and wanted to setup an arrangement.  After talking 
with them and seeing the networks I represent, they made the offer of a 
free subscription.  I chose to use their standard lookups anyway even 
though they offered to work with me for arrangements that benefitted me.
Not everyone is perfect, but there is more to this maps/orbs/* story and 
it isn't all evil :)
