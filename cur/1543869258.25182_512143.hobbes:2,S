Not for possessing it.  For acquiring it unlawfully, and for doing
things with it that violate M$ copyright.

The FSF makes lots of such claims, all the time, and Eben Moglen uses
them to finesse his letter-of-opinion / affidavit racket, along with
the fork/exec fetish.  Fluendo.  Vidomi.  XCode.  Tornado.  NeXT.
Progress Software.

Complete object files for the rest of the non-GPL application.  This
applies principally to static linking.  It also makes it much easier
to reverse engineer the application, because unless the person
jockeying the linker is really, really good, all of the interfaces
between the application components are visible with nm and objdump,
and you can use tools like ltrace to watch the calling sequences
between modules.  Selective symbol stripping and obfuscation on
partially linked binaries takes skill.

No, flex is simpler because libfl is obviously a separate work of
authorship with a stable external interface, and the application that
links against it is not a derivative work of any of the creative
expression inside libfl.

That's rubbish.  Copyright in compiled code is very nearly identical
to copyright in the source code from which it was generated; see
references in Lexmark, especially the seminal Altai case.  Copyright
in silicon is _not_ identical to copyright in the RTL from which it
was synthesized -- the term of protection for a "mask work" is limited
to 10 years -- 2 if it's not registered properly.  This prima facie
bizarre situation reflects the difference in national origin and
lobbying power between software and hardware makers, as well as the
greater difficulty of extracting the theory of operation of a complex
chip using an electron microscope.  The chip design oligopoly is bound
by a web of contractual covenants not to do this anyway, and they like
being able to snap up key people from upstart maverick companies and
rip off their designs without pesky legal interference.

Not really.  Using stock images to illustrate a manuscript requires
license to copy and distribute them but rarely, if ever, creates a
derivative work.

Right.

Still nonsense.  It does not "merge your work" in any sense relevant
to copyright.  Insofar as any text has been copied from the library or
its sample applications to your application code, it is overwhelmingly
likely (IANAL, TINLA) to be considered part of the "scenes a faire" of
making engineering use of the library.  (This is, ironically, part of
the "doctrine of merger" of ideas and expression, which always, always
works against the party claiming copyright infringement.)  Insofar as
you have glued together program and library to form an engineering
product, it is again overwhelmingly likely to be considered a mere
"parcel of goods" and require authority from the library copyright
holder to copy and distribute.  See, however, Mirage Editions v.
Albuquerque A.R.T. -- you had better be relying on a valid license,
not "fair use", if your work may interfere with the library copyright
holder's ability to monetize his.

Right.

Doesn't matter to copyright.  Copyright is not about engineering use or purpose.

Not for any copyright purpose.  They are separate works of authorship,
whether or not the same entity holds copyright on them.

Irrelevant to copyright.  Copyright is not about engineering
necessity.  Some defenses against a claim of copyright infringement
are (again, see Lexmark), but you don't need any of those defenses --
you are operating under the terms of a valid contract containing
license from the copyright holder.

Whether it is a derivative work is determined, solely and exclusively,
by whether it "recasts, transforms, or adapts" the creative expression
in the original -- whether or not it could have been created in its
present form without reference to the original.  See Lotus v. Borland.

These are indeed obvious; but no more obvious (in terms of the
mountain of case law) than flex or bison or readline.

Ain't gray.  It's the blinding, shining, white of spotless innocence.
You just haven't awakened completely from Eben Moglen's opium dream in
which white is black and the question is who's to be master, that's
all.
