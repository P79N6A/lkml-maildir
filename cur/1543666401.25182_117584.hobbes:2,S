Indeed. If you get there, the command in progress is hung.
To be able to restart the device, the old command needs to be
aborted. But that is an inherently racy undertaking. 
Nominally, I just want to set HWGROUP(drive)->handler = NULL.
But there is a small chance, that there is actually (interrupt) 
activity going on for the command, which would result in a new 
entry in HWGROUP(drive)->handler popping up after it is cleared.
The loop as programmed significantly increases the odds that 
the old command is really aborted. 
It may not be elegant to schedule(1) with the lock taken, but it
does work.
However, my latest patch doesn't seem to be applied, since in my
version I have a set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE); before 
the schedule.
