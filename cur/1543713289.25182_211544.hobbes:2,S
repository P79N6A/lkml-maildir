This only helps cpu_online_map and cpu_possible_map, and only on UP's.
My controversial patch 24/23 helps all MASK_ALL based initializations,
and all mask_of_bit based initializations, for all systems up to 32 CPUs
(or 64, depending on sizeof(long)).
In particular, grep for 'cpumask_of_cpu(0)' in the kernel. You will find
many hits.  This should be efficient for all 'normal' sized systems.
