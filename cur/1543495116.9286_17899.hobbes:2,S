hi,
	I recently installed Redhat 6.0 on a P120, with a 16GB IBM EIDE
drive, and I came across a wierd problem with Lilo, (btw full partition is
under 1024 cyl boundary)...
I upgraded the kernel to 2.2.7, and added the new kernel to the lilo.conf
and moved the old kernel to the second entry, I ran lilo and it I booted
into 2.2.7, I was messing about and I re-ran lilo under 2.2.7, and when I
booted I got a crc-error in the kernel, and system halted, but I could
still boot the backup 2.2.5-15 image no problems, which I did, re-ran lilo
under 2.2.5-15 and I could boot 2.2.7 again .. until I tried running lilo
again under 2.2.7 and the same thing happened ..
Any ideas?
Dave.
