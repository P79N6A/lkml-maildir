readb/writeb do not have to be PCI. 
Any bus that looks from a sw perspective enough like it might as well be
considered "PCI-like". Some of them may or may not need ioremap(). It
becomes a problem only if there is a machine that has BOTH a real PCI
bus _and_ something else, but with an old m68k mac that doesn't end up
being a problem.
