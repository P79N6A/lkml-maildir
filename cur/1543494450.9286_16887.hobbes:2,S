I've just been given a new Kenwood TrueX 40x CDROM drive that
claims in the manual to quote:
"The TrueX 40x40 is the only drive in the world that delivers
over 40X speed across the entire disc, maintaining a sustained
data transfer rate of over 6Mb per second.  This speed is
comparable to most fast hard disk drives and faster than most
removable optical storage devices available today."
I've tested this drive in Win95 and it gets roughly 6Mb per
second as quoted above.
In linux however, I get:
1 root@red:~# hdparm -t /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in 20.05 seconds = 1.60 MB/sec
Which is closer to 10x than it is to 40x.  Does Linux require
some special support to get this drive to push 6Mb/s?
It is a standard atapi drive, and as far as I see, it requires no
special software in other OS's to achieve it's claimed speeds.
Does anyone know what other factors may come into play?
