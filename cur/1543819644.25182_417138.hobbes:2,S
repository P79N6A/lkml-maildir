Thanks for that. When it happened today on 2.6.16.7,
I've started using deadline now.
A couple of interesting things I've noticed after its
recovery:
1. Executing "time sleep 1", takes more than 1 second.
It reports real as 3 to 5 seconds, while my stop watch
measures it as closer to 50 seconds.
2. Pressing & holding a key at the console doesn't
produce repeating characters.
Thought they might shed some light on the problem. (I
ought to look at all the RTC & Time related settings
between my minimal .config & FC5's, for I believe
they're connected.)
I haven't rebooted it yet. I'm sure it'll be back to
normal after the reboot.
Thanks
