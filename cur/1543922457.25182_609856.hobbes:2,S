Then the first attempt to set the size could be made to fail
(because it could not get the lock immediately) and the
size could be set after the second resume instead.
- Setting the size would lag behind the actual size the dm table was
supporting, but (given the usage cases discussed) this would not matter.

So we cannot avoid fixing that: we require immediate return
with failure instead of waiting.

If the size setting is removed from the lock, then it becomes
"set the inode size to match the current size of the table" and
races would not matter - each "set size" attempt would set it
to the instantaneous live table size, not a cached value that
could be out-of-date.
