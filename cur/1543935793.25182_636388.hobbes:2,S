I just assumed (wrongly, as it seems) that the API change didn't remove
any useful functionality.
Also, I don't want to ask users with unusual hardware to patch their
kernels to take the trace.

The problem is that mmiotrace only makes sense in combination with
non-free drivers, and I'm not sure it would be welcome in the kernel
even if you say so.
The hooks for page faults could be useful for something (debugging, some
non-traditional swap implementations), but I don't want to invent
reasons why somebody else might need them.

Exactly.  In MadWifi, they are inlined on i386 and x86_64, and I cannot
ask every user with an unsupported card to get a Mac.

Seconded.
