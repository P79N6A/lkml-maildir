Yes, true. But if we use zones for containers and say we have 400
of them, with all of them under limit. When the system wants
to reclaim memory, we might not end up reclaiming the best pages.
Am I missing something?

Yes, we have some changes that we've made to the reclaim logic, we hope
to integrate a page cache controller soon. We are also testing the
patches. Hopefully soon enough, they'll be in a good state and we can
request you to merge the containers and the rss limit (plus page cache)
controller soon.
