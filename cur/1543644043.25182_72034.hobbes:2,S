This is why we had to make another abstraction layer that was the "uniqueness 
driver" This allowed the admin to configure a device without seial numbers to 
be multipathed if they knew it was multipathed by explicitly specifing the 
host bus, target, lun of all the paths to a speciic device. We never got the 
chance to develop an intellegent way a determining multipathed-ness so we 
left it to the user. Not ideal but it worked for our customer.  I would like 
to think there is a better way to determind uniqueness, but the nice thing 
was we made the uniquness driver a module that could be replaced, thus 
letting us develop new uniqueness algorithms in the future. I think the 
concept is good, maybe not the implimentation. It also allows you to say you 
don't like how we do... well you know the rest 
Thanks
Brian
