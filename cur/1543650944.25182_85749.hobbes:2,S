It's not a fscking public service.  Linus has full control over his
tree.  You have equally full control over your tree.  Linus can't
tell you what patches to apply in your tree.  You can't tell Linus
what patches he should apply to his.
"I'm not satisfied with this tree, I'll try that one" is perfectly OK.
"I'm not satisfied with either, so bend the fsck over and change your
tree the way I want" is _NOT_.
