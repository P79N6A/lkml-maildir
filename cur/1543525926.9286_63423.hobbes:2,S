Does anyone have any (bad) experiences with this scsi controller?
It's an OEM product from a Danish PC 'manufacturer'. I was unable to find out
who makes it for them, but I did get the chipsets:
Advansys     (maybe advansys actually makes the board)
ASC3550B
F01 ASU11703.1
A0290528600
Winbond
W29CO11A-15
9320N212247901UG
Greb'ing through the scsi sources and doc it seems like it ought to work.
I'll put it on an Abit ZM6 i440ZX socket370 mobo with a celeron466.
And yes, I know that eg. Buslogic (which I use myself) would be preferred, but
this is for my girlfriend's phd study, and there are so many restrictions as to
where we can buy; was a nightmare specifying the system within budget.
Sorry I'm not currently on this list, so pls reply to me personally.
