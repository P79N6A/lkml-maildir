Just tried that, unfortunately this network card isn't supported from 
8139cp driver.

Andrew's messages are in CC: to the netdev@oss.sgi.com list, so I think 
they're already aware of the problem.

Great! I'm going to test that right now, surely better than deploying 
customized kernels in all servers until an "official" patch comes out.
Thank you very much, Marco.
