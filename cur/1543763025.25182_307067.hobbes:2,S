00:0d.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev 06)
        Subsystem: Creative Labs CT4832 SBLive! Value
and the one you didn't ask for:
00:0d.0 Class 0401: 1102:0002 (rev 06)
        Subsystem: 1102:8027
This made me realize that I could still try to hack it myself. The
following patch somehow helped:

Now the card will be listed as "S1024" instead of "Unknown" so that's a
change. Looks like the short name is auto-generated? Unfortunately
that's still not "Live" as before so my mixer settings are not back yet.
And I believe that "Live" was a much better name than "S1024" too.
Thanks,
