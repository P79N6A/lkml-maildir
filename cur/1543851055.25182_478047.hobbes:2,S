Hi Rolf,
Thanks for your comments. Unfortunately, given some of the platforms we
want to support, I cannot reserve memory at boot time, so I had to find
some other way. Besides, it is anyway interesting to see how to present
a buffer allocated using the DMA interfaces (pci_alloc or dma_alloc) to
the user space.
All the best,
Guillermo
