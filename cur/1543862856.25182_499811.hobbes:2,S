Hmmm, the hw folks tell me that "other" os'es implement that. But I
would tend to agree that system firmware should probably be doing this.

Install rhel4 u4 on ia64, at the reboot prompt let the system sit idle
for several hours or overnight. Then after rebooting the filesystems are
totally trashed. I usually get a message that the kernel is not a valid
compressed file format. If I try to rescue the system I cannot mount any
filesystems. I don't have the message handy but it complains about an
invalid Verneed record, whatever that is.
I've also tried the same procedure using a dumb SAS hba. It complained
that it couldn't read the initrd image but on a second attempt it acted
like it read the initrd but the system goes out in the weeds while
booting. Not the same symptoms but I suspect there's some relationship.
I have not tried any other distros yet.
Thanks,
mikem
