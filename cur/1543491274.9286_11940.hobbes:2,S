Pardon my ignorance.  I was wondering if it was possible to do a kernel
 "swap".
 I.E. on a SMP machine split it off into a virtual machine like that
software
 that was on freshmeat recently, it continues running, the other processor
 handles the compile of the kernel, and then the kernels communicate all the
 scheduling/processing/ram etc and "swap" to the new kernel.  Keeping the
 uptime and continuing to stay up.  I heard of something like this on SGI
but
 I may be wrong.   It's probably far more complex to pull of than what I put
 here... just wondering if it was possible.   If it was possible on a single
 processor machine even better....
 something to discuss anyway.
 Thanks
 Mark Harburn.
