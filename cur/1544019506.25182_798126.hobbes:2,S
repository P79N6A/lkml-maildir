After reading how work the async jobs (kernel/async.c), I think it would be better
to actually use it instead of creating a thread through a workqueue and wait for a
counter to be zero to be sure all is flushed.
The async functions provide local execution and synchronisation domains through special cookies,
which means long tasks of mouse resync will not starve other works.
What do you think about it?
