Ok, I tried that and I got a nice clean fix.  For 2.6.22.  Backporting 
this to 2.6.21 creates havoc, as a number of cleanup patches as well as 
changes to highmem code get in the way.
Andi, do you really want to deal with the conflicts this will create for 
the paravirt queue for 2.6.22, or would you rather apply the dumb yet 
simple and non-confrontational workaround I have been trying to get 
applied to 2.6.21?
