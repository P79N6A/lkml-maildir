Do you see a difference between VMware and other processes
in their susceptibility to this problem?  If VMware runs
slowly because it gets scheduled in while the CPU is idle
and the apm driver fails to busyize the CPU, won't the same
thing happen for other processes?  If so, then our idle 
handling is fundamentally broken.  If not, then what makes
VMware special?
