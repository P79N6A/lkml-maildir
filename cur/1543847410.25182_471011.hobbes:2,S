I do not understand, both /dev/fbcfag12864b and /dev/cfag12864bX are
in /dev/...
What is advantage of /dev/cfag12864bX over /dev/fbcfag12864b ?
(And I guess you should invent better name... /dev/fbaux0?)

I do not think we need a Kconfig option, and I do not think we need
/dev/cfag12864bX . Just use /dev/fbaux0, always.

I do not think it is suitable for -rc at this point, and it does not
have chance before 2.6.20-rc1, anyway.
