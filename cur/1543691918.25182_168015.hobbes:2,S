Marcelo would no longer be able to just pull in eg. the
PPC tree, it would mean merging pain for branched trees,

Effort where ?
If you're talking about adding more effort into merging
things into 2.4, then DUH. You would NEED more effort to
get stuff merged, if marcelo used something as bad as CVS.
If you're talking about improving CVS, don't bother. The
model is broken.

There's more than a slight chance.  Just come up with
something that's as good as, or better than, bitkeeeper
and people will switch in a heartbeat.
