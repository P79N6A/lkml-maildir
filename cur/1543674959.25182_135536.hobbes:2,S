I could finally enable DMA, only if I do it at run time :
  - enable "Generic PCI bus master DMA support"
  - disable "Use PCI DMA by default when available"
  - hdparm -d 1 /dev/every_disk
I realized that a "idex=nodma" option is really lacking here. Shouldn't we
disable IDE by default on Alpha at the moment, so that it at least boots ?
The adventurous could always use hdparm to enable it again (it survived my
39 GB save/restore).

Willy
