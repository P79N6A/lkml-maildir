All of that is correct.  For XPMEM, we do not currently allow file backed
mapping pages from being exported so we should never reach this condition.
It has been an issue since day 1.  We have operated with that assumption
for 6 years and have not had issues with that assumption.  The user of
xpmem is MPT and it controls the communication buffers so it is reasonable
to expect this type of behavior.
