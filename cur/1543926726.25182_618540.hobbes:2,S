Thomas Renninger is working on PNP patches so we can accomodate any
number of resources.  We had talked about an interim solution like
the one Shaohua is proposing, but thought the space overhead was
objectionable:

However, we did not realize that switching from the ACPI motherboard
driver to the PNP driver would cause a regression.  Since that's the
case, I don't think we have much choice -- I think we have to either
increase the table sizes until we can handle things dynamically, or
switch back to the ACPI motherboard driver until we have Thomas's
work.  For a -stable patch, I think enlarging the tables is safer.
The space analysis above was based on increasing PNP_MAX_PORT from
8 to 32 and PNP_MAX_IRQ from 2 to 4 (total increase of 26 resources
per device).  Shaohua's patch adds 16 port and 8 mem resources for
an increase of 24, so will use slightly less space.
