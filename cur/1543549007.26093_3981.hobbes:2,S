Hello,
	I was wondering what would be most recommended as routing kernel.
	I had been using 2.0.35preX for like 630 days and it worked 
	relatively fine.
	Now, I'm wondering what would be next best kernel I would want
	to put there? Should I use latest 2.0.X kernel or latest 2.2.x
	kernel or maybe 2.4.0-test kernels? 
	I'm looking for good support for both routing as well as NAT.
	I heard the 2.0.x is one of the best kernels in terms of 
	VM management, what might matter considering the router is to
	be P75 w/ 16mb ram.
	obtw: before someone suggest alternative solutions, the machine
	in question is a laptop with two "New Media Live Wire" NIC's
	and only Linux supports those (and yes, PCMCIA NIC is not great
	performace but it should be adquate for current needs).
