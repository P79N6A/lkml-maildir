No - there's absolutely no coherency between the I-cache and D-cache.
However, the I-cache and D-cache are individually PIPT.

I guess that answers the question, thanks.

I'm now told that the system is only coherent with the caches in
write back write allocate mode, which is rather odd since it appears
stable with write back read allocate.  However, I'll forward your
comments back to the designers.
Thanks David.
