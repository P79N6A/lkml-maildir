Subject: [PATCH]: Bug in MM_RB debugging?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The code is seemingly trying to make sure that rb_next()
brings us to successive increasing vma entries.
But the two variables, prev and pend, used to perform these
checks, are never advanced.
