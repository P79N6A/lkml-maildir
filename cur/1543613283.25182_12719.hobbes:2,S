Hm, that is interesting. In my /etc/esound/esd.conf there are these
few lines:
[esd]
auto_spawn=0
spawn_options=-terminate -nobeeps -as 5
spawn_wait_ms=100
So esd already has -as parameter, but if I look in the process list I
see it started only as `esd -nobeeps'. I'll investigate further...
Thanks for the idea.
