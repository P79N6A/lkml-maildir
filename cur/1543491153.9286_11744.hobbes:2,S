Today I experienced the same problem. Few applications died in short
burst, but in my case they were NOT interconnected. One of them was
klogd so I don't have log excerpt to attach. But I found this:
Mar 23 02:24:55 atlas kernel: Out of memory for gnome-name-serv. 
Looks like we have some trouble somewhere.
Could it be connected to the recent change in inode memory allocation
algorithm (two instead of one page at a time)?
