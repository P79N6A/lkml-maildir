Not only had I read the announcement for 2.2.5, and was fully
aware that Linus delayed the posting for good reason, but I also
was correct.  Kernel announcements are posted here.  The fact
that the message was delayed is irrelevant.
>The original author's post was made before linus announced 2.2.5,
*THAT* I did not realize.  Firstly, my posting was not a flame,
but meant to be informative.  Since I got the announcements just
fine, I couldn't see how he didn't if he reads the same list.  I
just pointed out that i had in fact read the announcements, and
so they were there.  I sort my email by subject for threading in
PINE, and did not try and co-relate the announcement posting with
the time of the poster's posting time.  I assumed that he simply
did not get an announcement, or did not see one.  A fair
assumption.
>but after several people had started discussing it.
Fine.  You misunderstood my message.  I misunderstood his reason
for posting.  Now back to our regularly scheduled programming,
and we can put this in the bitbucket.
