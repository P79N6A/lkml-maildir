What is tainting your kernel?
If it's nVidia, the most likely reason is a double free by the binary-only 
nVidia driver, which just hits us when we free something unrelated.

Is it in the same place? Which 2.4.x? The task free code has changed a bit
with the threading stuff, and the latest RH 2.4.x kernels with the new
threading code are more similar to 2.6.1 than older 2.4.x kernels are.
