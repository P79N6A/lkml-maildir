They are magic numbers. I have only the vague idea on
what most of these numbers mean. I digged them out
from TI's/everest's binary driver.
Luckily, Vayo's linux binary had every register
accessed from separate function, so, at least,
register names are known with certain confidence.

I already have "socket". "card" is something that is
plugged into the "socket". It's hard to think about
short name that fits here nicely.

Unfortunately, hardware does care. Output of
tifm_sd_op_flag is set into upper half of command
register. The fall-back is 0 (implied default for both
switches).

The TI binary drivers tests for the command type
before setting the appropriate bit in command register
(similar to tifm_sd_op_flags).
In general: while I'm using code flow different from
this used in TI's binary drivers, I tried very hard to
preserve register access semantics. When I failed to
do so, very bad things happened - sporadic and brutal
kernel crashes and run-aways. I think they were caused
by device writing random junk to some memory address
at arbitrary times.
