The reason I ask is to find out whether it could be what Compaq
describe as problem MGO101612 on
http://ftp1.service.digital.com/patches/public/Digital_UNIX/v3.2d-1/duv32de1as00003-19980227.README
(It also occurs on 3.2c...)
If so, the following patch may help. I must however admit, I'd be very 
surprised if it really is this bug that is causing your problem, as the
likelihood of it occurring is low unless 'jiffies' takes some very
large value...
Cheers,
  Trond
