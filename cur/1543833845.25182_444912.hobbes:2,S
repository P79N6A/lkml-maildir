I was preparing a post to lkml about a similar hang which happens
during init. I also saw an error while ntpdate tried to set the
time/get the time. this only happens after I've enabled the NX bit on
the dual 32bit Xeons installed in the HP Proliant Server. it works
flawlessly with 2.6.17.6 (CONFIG_X86_PAE and CONFIG_HIGHMEM_64) but
since 2.6.18-rc2-git4 (including 2.6.18-rc2) it hangs late in the init
process.
could this be related?
