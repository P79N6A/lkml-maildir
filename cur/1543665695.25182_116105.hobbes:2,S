That's fine, I can deal with that. But this patch only allows you to add
a ->remove member to a device, which will aide in ensuring that.
Currently there's not even a check in the driver core for whether a
device has children when it is removed. Adding the remove function will
make it easier for the bus to validate a device, sanity check it, and
cleanup after it before it gets demolished from the core.
Maybe you need to {get,put}_device() wrap the call to remove, but that
shouldn't be a big problem with locking (really, the patch is simple).
