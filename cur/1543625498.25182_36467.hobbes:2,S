You need interrupts to handle this, even if you don't wrap it in the top
layer of signals it will be able to use much of the code I agree. The nasty
case is the "currently running on another cpu" one. Especially since you 
can't just "trap it" - if you IPI that processor it might have moved by the
time the IPI arrives 8)
