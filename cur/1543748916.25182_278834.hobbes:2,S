Hi,
Version -12 has been uploaded. Changes:
- Small optimization to choose next request logic
- An idle queue that exited would waste time for the next process
- Request allocation changes. Should get a smooth stream for writes now,
  not as bursty as before. Also simplified the may_queue/check_waiters
  logic, rely more on the regular block rq allocation congestion and
  don't waste sys time doing multiple wakeups.
- Fix compilation on x86_64
No io priority specific fixes, the above are all to improve the cfq time
slicing.
