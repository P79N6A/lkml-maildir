Until 2.1.5.8, I had put in support ('device trees') for handling the
devices we're using in writing the image separately. Unused devices were
suspending prior to beginning to write the image and not resumed before
powerdown. At resume time, they were suspended and not resumed until the
whole image had been re-read. In short, it did what you're asking.
>From what I understand, though, work on the driver model and individual
drivers should be making this unnecessary. If that's not true, I'll
happily put the device tree code back in. For now, though, I've been
seeking to implement changes that will help with getting the code
merged, and this was one of them.
Regards,
Nigel
