No, it's not the same driver core. Take a look yourself.
I used the 2.4.16 code as basis. There have not been any patches since
that (at least in the 2.4 series).
I am currently also re-writing the X driver using the new core (and
eventually VESA functions).

The timings are taken from the machine's BIOS. If that data is wrong, no
driver will ever work.
