Ingo,
FYI, I ran this on my laptop (Pentium4 HT) and it locked up shortly
after it started INIT.  I rebooted, and now it's up and running 
with no problems!?!  I'll reboot it a few more times to see if it will
lock up again.
Unfortunately, my laptop doesn't have any serial so I don't have much to
debug with it.  I'll set up netconsole, but this is not as reliable
under RT, or was this fixed. I remember before that it could call things
that would schedule and had some hooks to keep interrupts on.
Oh, I also did get the message when it started:

The kernel I used was rt6 with my latest patch to the
raw_local_save_flags.
Config attached.
