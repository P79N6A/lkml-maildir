Current practice in the kernel is that when something that should not be 
done works by chance with some kernel versions and/or configurations 
that's simply an unfortunate fact that should be fixed but doesn't 
result in any guarantee that it works with all kernel versions and/or 
configurations.

It cannot be a regression since the kernel does not have a stable API 
for modules.

Why should we start with one step back for getting two steps ahead?
