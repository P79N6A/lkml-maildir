Well, since I can't rewrite the app, I can't make it sched batch.  Nice 
values are an easy thing to get at for anything that's running.
Besides, comparing nice 0 to nice 19, I'd expect something more like a 
100:1 ratio or worse.  (That is, I don't expect nice to be linear.)
Maybe this is just me, but when I set a process to the worst possible 
priority (nice 19), I expect it only to run when nothing else needs the CPU.
