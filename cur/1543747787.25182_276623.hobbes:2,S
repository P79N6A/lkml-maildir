Same experience as Thomas here. Full stop like his first log (no errors)
. PIII (Celeron) 900@1 gig, 256 meg mem, 1 gig swap, preempt enabled.
Tried your patch since the oom killer slaughtered a very important app 
here when another one ran amok. Not fork spawnings, just ram-eating. Was 
blender (3d renderer) in "Sequence Editor" mode when i hit alt-a (for 
animate) on a pretty large set of stills. Eventually blender got killed 
also, twice...
Kernel 2.6.9 with nick p-s? patch for the buggy kswapd (100 percent cpu, 
without using any swap).
Mvh
