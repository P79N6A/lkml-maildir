virt_to_page() should be pretty cheap, but you're right, that's probably 
the much higher expense than the test. And reading the "struct page" can 
get a cache-miss.  Although - especially for NUMA - we're actually going 
to do that virt_to_page() _anyway_ just a few lines below (as part of 
"virt_to_slab()".
Similarly, for "kfree()", we will actually have done that same thing 
already (kfree() does "virt_to_cache(objp);").
So we're actually only left with a single case that doesn't currently do 
it (and didn't trigger my trivial two additions): kmem_cache_free() just 
trusts the cachep pointer implicitly. And that's obviously the case that 
the whole fcntl_setlease thing used.
Everybody else would have triggered from my patch which added it at a 
point where it was basically free (because we had looked up the page 
anyway, and we were going to read from the "struct page" info regardless).
So from a performance standpoint, maybe my previous trivial patch is the 
right thing to do, along with an even _stronger_ test for 
kmem_cache_free(), where we could do
	BUG_ON(virt_to_cache(objp) != cachep);
which you can then remove from the slab debug case.
So for a lot of the normal paths, you'd basically have no extra cost (two 
instructions, no data cache pressure), but for kmem_cache_free() we'd have 
a slight overhead (but a lot lower than SLAB_DEBUG, and at least for NUMA 
it's reading a cacheline that we'd be using regardless.
I think it sounds like it's worth it, but I'm not going to really push it.
