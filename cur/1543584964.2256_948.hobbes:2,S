I don't think this makes sense at all.  The derivation of the config
values is the concern of the configuration system, not the code.
Consider something like CONFIG_CPU_HAS_FEATURE_FOO that might currently be
derived from CONFIG_CPU_BAR but may in the future be made independent. Or
vice-versa.  Your proposed name-change means additional maintenance
headache and gets you nothing that you couldn't get by simply including
whatever script you wrote to deduce the dependencies. Such a script would
at least be able to tell you what a variable was derived from.
