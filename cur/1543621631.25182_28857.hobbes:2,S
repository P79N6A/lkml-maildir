Second comment: devfs_(un)register_per_cpu() doesn't belong in
fs/devfs/base.c. I don't even think it should be in fs/devfs/util.c.
I think it belongs kernel/smp.c (that's right, create a new file).
There's too much duplicated SMP code in each arch/ tree. Let's create
a place for new stuff to be shared.
So, please send along your next version of the patch (inlined, of
course:-).
