	It is my understanding that the psn microcode is only reactivated 
upon system power-up and cannot be activated by a processor reset
"in-flight" during a Linux session.  In other words, you do not have to 
worry about the psn as long as you boot into a kernel with the deactivation 
code.  Of course, you could give the ppc or axp architectures a spin 
and not have to deal with Intel weirdness altogether, but that 
discussion is neither this mailing list nor topic of discussion :-) 
Regards,
Daniel
