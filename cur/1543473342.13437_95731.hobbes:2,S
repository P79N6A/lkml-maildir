hi,
Going through the man page for "ps" on a red hat release 2.0.32, it doesnt
seem to have an option for printing all the processes on the system. 
"ps a " gives only processes that have an associated tty. So I cannot do
something like "ps -ef | grep inet" (in solaris) to find out if the inet
daemon is running or not!
