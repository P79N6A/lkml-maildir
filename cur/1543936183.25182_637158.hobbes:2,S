I recently upgraded from an amd 64bit system to an intel one and changed my 
kernekl accordingly. Everything's great except this:
root         6  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        D<   17:11   0:00 [migration/1]
root         7  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        D<   17:11   0:00 [ksoftirqd/1]
root         8  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        D<   17:11   0:00 [watchdog/1]
I've tried various kernel configs and that stays the same, including a 
constant load of 3. My current kernel config and dmesg is attached
(compressed as I think the ml limit is 40k).
Not sure what other info to provide so if anything else would be
helpful, please shout.
