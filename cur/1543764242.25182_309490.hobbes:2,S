I'm not sure what's up here, it's a nasty issue with backlight. Can
radeontool bring it back ?

Yes. Unfortunately. It's surprised it is that slow though, there
shouldn't be more than 5 or 6 PLL accesses on a normal mode switch, with
5ms pause for each, that should still be very reasonable. It looks like
we are doing a lot more accesses which I don't completely understand.
