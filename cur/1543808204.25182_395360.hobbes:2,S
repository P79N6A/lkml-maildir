Regardless of whether you consider it a bug or the naming wrong[1], you
are not the Linux maintainer and Linux users have to put up with their
choices of kernel architecture.
So introducing your own naming scheme AFAIKS only serves to add more
confusion to the picture -- it seems fairly unlikely that you'll get the
kernel guys to change their minds.
Goes along the same lines as my point about filesystem naming. I wouldn't
write a portable program that asks users to save their files on /dev/hda
or /c_drive/blah when on windows. I'd agree to disagree with wnidows, and
use C:\ for the sake of everyone's sanity.
[1] I don't want to argue *that* point with you and I don't pretend
to know more about it than you or anyone else on this thread.
