I'm familiar with symptoms arising from various stochastic/assymetric
networking problems with larger frames, I had cable :)  This was a pull
(update), BTW, CVS can send more data in this situation too.  But it
turned painfully obvious when trying to send mail to LK via SMTP.  Oh,
but while plain rc2 may have this problem, this particular endpoint had
rc2-bk3 running.  I also chose to set the ethernet MTU to 1492 as an
easy workaround...
