Can be optimized and can be done by compiler are just words;

standards and implementation are on opposite poles of magnet

Why not just show actual objdump output on code (maybe with different
oxygen atoms used in gcc), rather than *talking* about optimization and
standards, hm?
I bet, that will be a key for success. And if you are interested in such
optimizations, why not to grep whole source tree for this kind of
things? I'm not sure one function in arch/x86_64 is only such ``unoptimized''.
And after doing that maybe you will see, that "{}" initializer can be
applied not only to integer values (you did init with of *long int*,
with *int*, btw), but to structs and others.
Ahh, one more thing about _optimizing_ your time, i.e. not wasting one.
Add to CC list people, who already did reply on you patch. Otherwise
you are showing your disrespect for them and hiding from further
discussion.
I think you do not, but Linux development not have an automatic system
for patch tracking, so you are on your own with your text editor and
e-mail client on this. Please take care for your time.
