hi all,
i have recompiled the kernel with CONFIG_PM_DEBUG but that resulted in nothing
more that a magic number after the backtrace, does anyone care ?
I played with hda=c,h,s to overcome the detection problem but no success here
beside some "TSC instability". i did not try this with a working kernel, it is only
to give you all information i have.
