So instead of using extra parentheses, we should include a copy of your 
response in every potentially ambiguous location instead?
Two C constructs that have bitten me in the glutinous maximus on more than 
one occasion:
mem_address = mem_base + page_index << 12;      // Wrong!
if ( bit_mask & BIT_FLAG == 0) { flag_not_set(); }      // Wrong!
Of course C has precedence. It's not always obvious. And the difference 
between this
x = y + z << 2;
and
x = (y + z) << 2;
is that the 2nd doesn't make me have to remember the relative precedences 
of + and <<.
