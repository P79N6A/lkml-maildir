*nod*
Not killing init when we "should" definately prevents
embedded systems from auto-rebooting when they should
do so.
(OTOH, I don't think embedded systems will run into
this OOM issue too much)

I believe the kernel automatically panic()s when init
dies ... from kernel/exit.c::do_exit()
        if (tsk->pid == 1)
                panic("Attempted to kill init!");
[which will make our system auto-reboot and be back on its feet
in a healty state again soon]

Rik
