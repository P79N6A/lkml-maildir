So does this mean that moving the user-visible cs/ds isn't likely to 
break stuff, if it has been done before?

Yep, I'm aware of that constraint.

Do you mean that something like dosemu/Wine needs to be able to use GDT 
#8?  Or is it only used in kernel code?

Why's that?  That cacheline (assuming 64 byte line size) already 
contains the user/kernel/cs/ds descriptors.
I'm thinking of putting together a patch to change the descriptor use to:
    8  - TLS #1
    9  - TLS #2
    10 - TLS #3
    11 - Kernel PDA
    12 - Kernel CS
    13 - Kernel DS
    14 - User CS
    15 - User DS
This has the advantage of leaving the user cs/ds unchanged.  From what 
people had said so far, this should be OK, other than making the heavily 
used TLS #1 share the BIOS common area entry number.  If this needs to 
be usable by userspace for something special, then making it TLS #1 
won't fly...
Alternatively, maybe:
    0  - NULL
    1  - Kernel PDA
    2  - Kernel CS
    3  - Kernel DS
    4  - User CS
    5  - User DS
    6  - TLS #1
    7  - TLS #2
which moves the user cs/ds, but avoids #8.
