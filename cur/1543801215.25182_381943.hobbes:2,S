in the kernel we could make a .text.rare section for functions, which we
could annotate with __rare.
The other way around, __fastpath or whatever is a bad idea, everyone
will consider all of their own functions as such (just like inline ;)...
go-fast-stripes all the way :-(
obvious candidates for __rare are
* pm suspend/resume functions
* error handling functions
* initialization stuff (including mount time stuff for filesystems,
  and hardware setup for drivers)
I wonder if gcc can be convinced to put all unlikely() code sections
into a .text.rare as well, that'd be really cool.
