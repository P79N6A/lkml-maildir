Hi!
I have setup a machine yesterday, and I have noticed strange behaviour.
DMA for one hard disk is enabled, while for other is not - at least that
is what hdparm says.
Motherboard/hard disks are:
Asus K7V + Athlon 700
2 x Quantum Fireball LM20.5 (primary and secondary master)
There is also a CD-ROM connected to primary port (as a slave).
Software RAID is being used. Kernel is 2.2.16 (plus RAID patches by Ingo
and IDE patches by Andre)
[root@abc ide]# hdparm -v /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 2498/255/63, sectors = 40132503, start = 0
[root@abc ide]# hdparm -v /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 39813/16/63, sectors = 40132503, start = 0
[root@abc ide]#
Although the hard disks are exactly the same, geometry is shown as
different. Any idea why?
Some more details:
[root@abc ide]# hdparm -i /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Model=QUANTUM FIREBALLP LM20.5, FwRev=A35.0700, SerialNo=884014769388

 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4 
 UDMA modes: mode0 mode1 mode2 mode3 *mode4 
[root@abc ide]# hdparm -i /dev/hdc 
/dev/hdc:
 Model=QUANTUM FIREBALLP LM20.5, FwRev=A35.0700, SerialNo=884014769086
 Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs }
 RawCHS=16383/16/63, TrkSize=32256, SectSize=21298, ECCbytes=4
 BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=1900kB, MaxMultSect=16,
MultSect=off
 DblWordIO=no, OldPIO=2, DMA=yes, OldDMA=2
 CurCHS=16383/16/63, CurSects=-66060037, LBA=yes, LBAsects=40132503
 tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 mword2 
 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4 
 UDMA modes: mode0 mode1 *mode2 mode3 mode4 
I am confused about UDMA mode 4 (on /dev/hda) and UDMA mode 2 (on
/dev/hdc). What is the difference? And why hdparm says that DMA is not
enabled on /dev/hda?
And the tests show:
[root@abc ide]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 16.53 seconds =  3.87 MB/sec
[root@abc ide]# hdparm -t /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.08 seconds = 20.78 MB/sec
[root@abc ide]#
The difference is *huge*, as you can see (and I can feel it while
working 8-( )

Is this known behaviour? If so, what can I do to fix it? :)
Thanks.
