hdparm -t /dev/hda (or /dev/sda -- it works for the SD interface as well) is 
a quick test of a drive's sequential read speed.
I have, at the time, noticed at least on older controllers/drives (Intel 430 
generation chipsets with things like 8G UDMA33 disks) that I could reliably 
increase the result with something like 1MB/s (to a total of 6 to 8, so it 
wasn't insignificant) by enabling 32-bit I/O. Had also understood that it 
shouldn't make a difference with DMA, but just went "oh well" and stuck a 
"hdparm -c1" in my bootup scripts.
(if anyone tries; note that hdparm -a can have a large effect on that result 
as well on some setups -- on machines where it does, -a 1024 usually gives 
me best results)
