In real life there are complicated stacks; sometimes they are open
source (for example, like JBoss or Tomcat), sometimes they are
propietary products, sometimes they are custom applications written by
the end-user.  Sun has been making big hay about how with dtrace, you
can easily figure out what is going on.  Systemtap is a tool that will
allow us to have have this kind of capability, and user space probes
is part of that project.
