I disagree violently. Why should the kernel headers pretend that a feature is
supported and then fail at runtime when we already know at compile time it
won't work?
I mean, in that case, lets add "KERN_DO_WHAT_I_REALLY_WANT". Programs can cope
with that at runtime then.
If a sysctl isn't supported for good anymore, it should be removed. The
program can check for this using autoconf or a Makefile define...
