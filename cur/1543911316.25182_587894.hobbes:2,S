Subject: [patch 04/28] uml: fix previous request size limit fix

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>
The previous patch which limited the number of sectors in a single request
to a COWed device was correct in concept, but the limit was implemented in
the wrong place.
By putting it in ubd_add, it covered the cases where the COWing was
specified on the command line.  However, when the command line only has the
COW file specified, the fact that it's a COW file isn't known until it's
opened, so the limit is missed in these cases.
This patch moves the sector limit from ubd_add to ubd_open_dev.
