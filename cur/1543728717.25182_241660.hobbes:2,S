Otherwise, this would be problematic. Consider the following:
config FOO
        bool "foo"
        select BAR
config BAR
        bool
        depends on BAZ
config BAZ
        bool
        default n
You can select FOO, which will select BAR. In your config, you'll end up with
CONFIG_FOO=y
CONFIG_BAR=y
# CONFIG_BAZ is not set
(similar result if you don't specify BAZ at all), which would get you into trouble. (I saw this while looking into what happens if s390 uses drivers/Kconfig, and got a headache why some stuff was selected by
allyesconfig that depended on pci).
Question: Is this a bug or a feature? If the latter, select should probably not be used on anything that has dependencies...
