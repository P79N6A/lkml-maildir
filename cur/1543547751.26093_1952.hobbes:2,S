Oh hell yes they do.  I've seen a single 28.8 user kill an email server.
(Ok, I'll admit Netscape Messenger Server is mostly to blame, but still.)
Mail isn't coming back to that address.  Let's see 1000 4k messages with
50 people per... that's about 22min to send spam to 50k addresses.  Hang
up, dialup with a differenat address, and send another 1000. (Granted,
the cable modem would take about 2 minutes, but it'd be hard to hide.)
