To follow up myself. Problem is not in networking itself, but in
tulip driver. One from 2.3.49-pre1 is OK, one from real 2.3.49
is not :-(
Jeff, do you have idea what in tulip patch which went into
2.3.49-pre2 is wrong? There are some changes, but I do not
see anything wrong...
I've found that 2.3.49+ shows RX framming errors, but 2.3.49-pre1 and
older shows 0 zero. Could it be that card thinks that I have
full duplex 10BaseT instead of half duplex one? But I do not
see how that patch 0.9.3 -> 0.9.4 could cause it :-(
                                    Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
