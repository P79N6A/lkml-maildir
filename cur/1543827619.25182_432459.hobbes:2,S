I agree with you David. I had to report a bug to the NTP mailing list. I
got it back right in my face because I had not subscribed. Then I went
to thei bugzilla interface... What a counter-intuitive tool ! I was about
to give up at least 3 times. It took me at least 15 minutes to find how I
could report my bug and provide the patch in a usable form. I'm really
sure that a lot of bug reports get lost because of this !
I'd rather get a few spams on LKML than lose bug reports because of
discouraged users !
Cheers,
Willy
