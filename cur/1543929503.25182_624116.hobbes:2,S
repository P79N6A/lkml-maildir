But we are talking about malicious programs, and so
there is a common motto:
"Poor Security Can Be Worse Than No Security", so
in this field often "none" is better that "some"
Really i don't understand why you push such module.
Malicious software in few generation (few years)
will use alternate methods. So the linux kernel
will be worse (and maybe will expose more bugs because
of complexity, and no problem are solved) but no
problem are solved.
See windoze: it is a patch after an other, so
the system is complex, unmaintainable and surely
not more secure. or do you want to change our behavior
as windows users: they compress files before to send
it, because of antiviruses policies.
If antiviruses will add security, we will not
have such big bot-nets and worms from the concurrent
OS.  Antiviruses offers only a short term cure.
