Great!

The naming will be consistant from now on.  Next release will be 004,
followed by 005, and so on.  Remember, version numbers mean nothing :)
As there is no installed base before 003, I don't think this will really
be a problem, do you?

It's older, I think.

I just got a patch today from Dan that merged the latest version of
libsysfs into udev.  It's in the udev bk tree already.  libsysfs will
always be a copy in the udev tree, as udev links statically, and it
keeps the build process and debug process much easier.
sysfsutils can still be its own package, other programs are starting to
use libsysfs already.

Yes, I would love to support that.  Care to send a patch?  :)
Of course you need a kernel patch for the sound class that is only
available in my kernel tree right now for sound devices to work with
udev...
thanks,
