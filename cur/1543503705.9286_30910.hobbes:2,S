actually, what is really needed is interrupt filtering, not
disabling. because the soundcard ADAC works as very nice timer, i
actually want the real time thread to get interrupts from it. at the
same time, i would like that processor to receive no other interrupts.
do you know of any way to do this ?

so far, it hasn't been a problem, but that doesn't mean i'm not
interested in improving things :)
