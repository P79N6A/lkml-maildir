No sane operating system lets user-space have access to pages that haven't 
been cleared.

A better way (and I believe the way Linux does it) is to map new pages to 
the zero page, read-only. If the process attempts to write to the zero 
page, we take a page fault and set up a new zeroed page, change the 
mapping, and return control back to that process.
