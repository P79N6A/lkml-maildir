I would check that you are not accidentally exceeding the bounds of
your array. Actual allocation occurs in page-size chunks. You may
be exceeding your 2048 byte-limit without exceeding the 4096-byte
page-size (of ix86).
However, a global array, or an array on the stack, has very strict
limits. You can blow things up on the stack by exceeding an array
boundary by one byte. And you can overwrite important memory objects
by exceeding the bounds of a global memory object.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
