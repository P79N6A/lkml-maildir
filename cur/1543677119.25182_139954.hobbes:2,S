Sigh...  The real problem is not in d_move(), but in the way NFS drops
dentries.  That, and the fact that we are eating the consequences of
RCU use in dcache - it had predictably made the entire thing _far_ too
subtle.
We probably should accept that both d_move() arguments can be unhashed.
After the move hashed status of source should remain as it is and
victim^Wtarget should get unhashed.
We _do_ need to sort out the situation with unhashing stuff in NFS - in
particular, the way it deals with mountpoints and with directories is
a mess.  I'm looking through that code, but it's bloody slow analysis
due to RCU.  Premature optimizations and all such...
