 contains an index to a number of
Linux distributions.  Check out the embeded kernels. They include some
Realtime mods. As an example, RTLinux claims to do hard realtime by
running the Linux kernel as it's lowest priority task. This is supposed
to allow serious realtime work without having to mess too much with
the kernel.
