Actually, lets see if I can summarize this more generically... I
realize I'm suggesting something that probably would be a massive
undertaking, but ..
Regular files are the only interface that requires an application to
wait.  With any other case, the nonblocking interfaces are fairly
complete and easy to work with.  If userspace could treat regular
files in the same fashion as sockets, life would be good.
I admittedly do not understand internal kernel semantics in the
differences between a socket and a regular file.  Why couldn't we just
have a different 'socket type' like PF_FILE or something like this?
Abstracting any IO through the existing interfaces provided to sockets
would be ideal from my perspective.  The code required to use a file
through these interfaces would be more complex in userspace, but the
abstraction of the current open() itself could simply be an aggregate
of these interfaces without a nonblocking flag.
It would, however, fix problems around issues with event-based
applications handling events from both disk and sockets.  I can't
trigger disk read/write events in the same event handlers I use for
sockets (ie, poll or epoll).  I end up having two separate event
handlers - one for disk (currently using glibc's aio thread kludge),
and one for sockets.
I'm sure this isn't a new idea.  Coming from my own development
backround that had little to do with disk, I was actually surprised
when I first discovered that I couldn't edge-trigger disk IO through
poll().
Thoughts, comments?
