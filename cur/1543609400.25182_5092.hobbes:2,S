As we mentioned on IRC, ymfpci uses ac97_codec, which does not contain
the ac97_reset function.

2.2.14?  Is that a typo?  His was patch for 2.4.15-pre2...
Anyway, my comments per request:
The patch looks ok, but I wonder about the order in ymfpci_resume.  You
load the mixer values -then- call ymfpci_download_image and
ymfpci_memload.  It seems for the purposes of general sanity and
stability you would want to load the mixer values after doing those two
operations.
