That check is already in checkpatch.  Problem is that hardly anyone
runs the thing.
I think we're ready to wire checkpatch up to a email robot which monitors
the mailing lists and sends people nastygrams.  I bet that'll be popular ;)
(I'd love it if it could detect wordwrapped and tab-expanded patches, too. 
You wouldn't _believe_...)
