It looks like this will cause problems if the user experiences an oops
during boot, runs for a few hours, and then has another oops.  Won't the
second oops fail to break the lock, and end up just deadlocking?
Yeah, of course you shouldn't blithely ignore the first oops.  But I bet
it happens.
Perhaps zap_spinlocks could be reset after 10 minutes without an oops?
