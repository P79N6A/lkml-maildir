Yes, but the old version of the patch calls on_each_cpu from
sysrq context, which is illegal since it could cause a deadlock.

It used to be sysrq-w in the patches that everybody has, but that
letter got taken for sysrq_showstate_blocked_op.
Only sysrq h, j, l, y and z are still free.  H is needed for help,
leaving just j, l, y and z.
I can see your point about overflowing the screen, however just
sysrq-p seems like a waste to have because it will probably not
print anything useful on a large CPU system...
If you still want it to be a separate letter, just let me know
which one of the last four I should take.
