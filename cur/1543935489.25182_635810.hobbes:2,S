Reuse the size argument of epoll_create, however the size must be smaller than the max file descriptor number: ether the resource limitation or the compiling time limitation.

Indeed, and we aren't going back.

I'm sure you can cook up a microbench that only does epoll_ctl(), and with 
a good hash implementation you get better numbers. This is what I did 
before I changed to rbtree, and the numbers did not justify the code (the 
"size" in epoll_create() is just an hint, and that means you need to 
handle resizing - plus other things like locking up memory when the number 
of fds shrinks, and other stuff I don't even remember).
