I see this behaviour also. I was having this happen with samba 1.9.18p?,
and I initially thought that it may be related to the version of samba
in use. However, the problems persisted after upgrading to samba 2.0.3.
This problem (for me) also exists with the 2.1.117 kernel I've got
floating around.  I can honestly say I never saw this with the 2.0.x
series.
Alan.
