i have an STB and have to switch back to 131 or so to watch video.  i don't
use modules, i'm using the definitions made by menuconfig.
unfortunately i don't get anything but a black screen.
Midnight kernel: i2c: initialized 
Midnight kernel: Linux video capture interface: v1.00 
Midnight kernel: bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 18) bus: 0, devfn: 136, irq: 9, memory: 0xe1804000. 
Midnight kernel: bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found. 
Midnight kernel: bttv0: audio chip: TDA9850 
Midnight kernel: bttv0: model: MIRO 
Midnight kernel: msp3400: init: chip=MSP3400@-@0 
the good thing is that it doesn't scroll a page now trying to init a non
existent msp3400 even tho it thinks there's one there.  one thing to note, i
do have devfs/msr on this 2.2.1-ac1 machine.
