i think this is directly related to what priority the ksoftirqd threads
have.

i think i fixed a related bug in the latest kernel(s):
touch_preempt_timing() was mistakenly 'touching' a live user-triggered
trace and could interfere in a similar fashion. Please re-report if this
still happens with -V0.7.26-3-ish or later kernels.

i'm currently trying to track down this one. The rq->nr_uninterruptible
count got out of sync during one of the scheduler changes - and this
causes large negative task counts, messing up the load-average.
