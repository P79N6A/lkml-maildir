I have tried moving the Kenwood CDROM and the Zip between channels and
this works well.  I would get rid of the zip if it was a viable option
but need it to do transfers, and the IBM has a real UDMA 66 cable and
upto ATA 100 capability so I wanted to take advantage of it.  Thanks to
all that helped me out, I have been using Linux for quite some time but
used to have a G3 PowerPC and some of the IDE timing things are quite
tricky as before I was using U/W Scsi3, thanks again.
