Seems to work nicely.

The worst that could happen is that some more interfaces are reported.
Since the information provided by SIOCGIFCONF isn't really enough to do
anything meaningful other calls are needed at which point those
interfaces can be weeded out, if this is wanted.  Also, the address
family reported for those interfaces is AF_UNSPEC which should be a hint
strong enough to recognize them.
