This is my approach.  AFAIK, SU works fine at protecting the filesystem 
unless there is a powerfail in the middle of writing out metadata.  This
is a _huge_ reduction in the window-of-vulnerability from the 15 seconds
of a sync to the 1 ms or so to write an inode.  But SU is succeptible
to that inode being trashed by a pf in the middle of the write.
I like SU because it is a proven 99% solution with minimal complexity
versus Journalling with a full load of uncertainties.  IMHO, only if 
versioning were available under JFS would it be worthwhile.

Good idea.  I certainly believe in stressing hardware (see .sig),
but I'm not sure this test is rigorous enough.  The problem is 
the reset button is only connected to the CPU and the hard disk
will probably continue to write out sectors from it's hw buffer.
OTOH, I don't like the idea of pulling the plug too often.  It's
very hard on the hardware.  I'd expect a mechanical disk failure
before 10,000 cycles.

Agreed!  I'm frankly appalled that Linux is has this vulnerability
at this stage in it's development.  Many places in W.Europe have
pretty reliable power, but here in N.America (Houston), single-feed 
powerfails are a monthly occurance.  Industries who cannot tolerate
this get a second feeder.  Then frequency drops to annual.
