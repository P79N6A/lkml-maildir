	hi,
	i read the man page more carefully, it says
	that the partition table is really just a
	textual partition table. the __u32 came
	from bsd partition table code i copied.
	i also fixed the doc. the 9fat always has
	the same starting sector number with the
	plan9 partition table, only plan9 put its
	information in the 2nd sector.
