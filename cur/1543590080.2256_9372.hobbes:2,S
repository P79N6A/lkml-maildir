has anyone else had problems with pci_map_sg() in 2.4.4-ac*? i get the
message from line 512 in pci_iommu.c, "pci_map_sg failed: could not
allocate dma page tables" printed about 10 times, then a second or two
later, it kills the interrupt handler. it's being called by the sym53c8xx
driver. it's easily reproducible, by bunzip linux.tar.bz | tar x.
this is on a pws 500ua, btw.
