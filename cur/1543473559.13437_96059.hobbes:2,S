Ahh, this looks a lot more like the problem is something in the new BSD
partition finding code than the TSC I first suspected. 
Could you try just reversing the BSD parition diffs to see, and perhaps
jot down at least the basics of the oops (even just eip: then doing a
	gdb vmlinux
	(gdb) x/10i <saved-eip>
will give some useful information).
