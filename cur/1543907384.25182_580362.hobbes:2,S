I was under the impression that there were other cases as well 
(interrupt handlers, for instance) where the value could be modified 
"behind the back" of the current code.
It seems like this would fall more into the case of the arch providing 
guarantees when using locked/atomic access rather than anything 
SMP-related, no?.
