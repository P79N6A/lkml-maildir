Erhmm, sorry that I have to say this Paul, but this
sounds like non-overcommit is about shifting the blame
and not about fixing the problem...
Knowing all of this, would you still want a non-overcommitting
system where you need more swap just to run out of memory sooner?
If a renegade application steals all memory, it will cause
other (innocent) applications to die. Unless you have some
code in the kernel which is able to shoot down the renegade
process and save the rest.
(non-)overcommit isn't going to make any difference here...
regards,
Rik
