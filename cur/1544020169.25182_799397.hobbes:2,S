Just recently the io schedulers started checking for SSD devices, so
today it should not matter performance wise (throughput) whether you use
CFQ or NOOP on eg the eeepc. The io scheduler is still quite important
for providing fair access to the device, especially on the cheaper end
of the SSD segment.
