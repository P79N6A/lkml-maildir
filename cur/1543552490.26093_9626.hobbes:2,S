Yes, this is a bug in the compiler (which I hope to fix today, CVS gcc is
broken as well), though the actual place which causes this to be miscompiled
is in the system headers where a restrict keyword is used on an incomplete
struct timeval forward definitions pointer and due to bug is set in the type
structure itself (at least that's my guess, need to run it under debugger
today - but if the select prototype is moved after the full struct timeval
definition, everything works correctly). Note that gcc 2.95.2 has some
restrict keyword related bugs as well (which glibc had to work around in
the headers; the bug was in 2.95.x only), it is not just 2.96.
