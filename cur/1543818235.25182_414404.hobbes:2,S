truncate_count is playing a useful role with the vma tree, allowing
us to find our place again after allowing preemption in.  Though I'm
sometimes wondering whether just to make the vma _bigger_ and add a
list instead of that truncate_count: construct a list of vmas from
the prio_tree for unmap_mapping_range, so it can keep place in that,
instead of having to restart the tree whenever preempted.  But I
think NFS doesn't hold i_sem across unmapping, so it wouldn't work.

That part is easily dealt with, as Nick and I have suggested,
just by marking vmas liable to having their pages truncated.
But that's certainly no more than one part of a larger solution.

I see ~2% slowdown in relevant faulting tests e.g. the lmbench ones.
I'd certainly prefer not to be locking pages here: or not without
word from the high-scalability people that Andrea's patch really in
practice doesn't hurt them (but the ~2% I see is on UP as much as MP).

I'm thinking on it, but not finding it easy.  And I've just realized
that invalidate_inode_pages2 isn't the only problematic case here
(though agreed the more urgent one): MADV_REMOVE likewise needs to
invalidate pages without adjusting i_size, so also cannot rely on
the truncate_count/i_size method.

I'd be glad of that too.
