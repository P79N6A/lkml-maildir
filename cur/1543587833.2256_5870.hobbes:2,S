Agreed.

This presumes one is using X.  On a non-X system, .Xdefaults
should mean nothing.  If anything I think cml2 is no different
from anything else.  Some sane colors should be chosen to default
to, preferably not too far off from CML1menuconfig, and leave it
more or less like that.  If it _must_ be configureable, put it in
a ~/.cmlrc
Then do the equiv of:
${CMLRC:=~/.cmlrc}
If someone doesn't like the extra dotfile in ~, they can set
	CMLRC=~/.etc/.cmlrc
or somesuch from ~/.bashrc and friends.  Anything more would be
indeed featureitis IMHO, or abusing a defined file format
(Xdefaults).
