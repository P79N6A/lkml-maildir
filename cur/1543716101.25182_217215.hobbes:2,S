Subject: [PATCH] 2.6 I2C re-add i2c_get_client()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
here's a patch which re-adds i2c_get_client() back to i2c_core.c.
That call was removed in 2003 because there were no users of that
function at that time.
I think this call is needed for I2C chip drivers which provide functionality to
be used by other driver modules, for example RTC chips or EEPROMs. These chip
drivers tend to encapsulate raw i2c chip access and provide function calls
for other modulesi, for example via the i2c_driver->command() method.
I tried to get the locking right, so please comment. The patch is
against 2.6.6-rc3 and works quite fine with my i2c rtc chip.
Thanks,
	Stefan E.
