I've never heard any suggestion of anybody wanting to include a
readonly device in an md array -  I guess one could imagine an array
of CDROMs, but I doubt anyone would actually create one.
However I agree that falling back to read-only (particular if the
error value indicated that this was the only problem) would be a
sensible thing to do in some circumstances.
More interestingly:  one could argue that when the md array is
switched to read-only, each component device should be reopened as
read-only.  So I would really like the interface to have a way to
switch a device between read-only and read-write without closing and
re-opening.
Though I guess opening and then closing as you suggest below would be OK.

I would *really* like to see this.  When the root filesystem gets
mounted read-only, I want md to know so that it can mark the array as
'clean' straight away.  I really don't like having a reboot-notifier
to mark all arrays as 'clean' on shutdown.
So each device would be responsible for keeping a count of 'readonly'
and 'read-write' accesses?  Or would that be in common code?
I look forward to this all getting cleaned up!
