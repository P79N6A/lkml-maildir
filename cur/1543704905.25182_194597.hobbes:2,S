yup. The key drivers we deal with reached that point last year.
Drivers could always be better. But those issues have been discussed
and presented:
o LinuxTag 2002 keynote by Alan Cox, "Submitting new Kernel drivers"
	(
http://gsyprf11.external.hp.com/porting_zx1/mgp/Code.mgp
)
o OLS 2002 talk by Arjan van de Ven, "How not to write kernel drivers"
o OLS 2002 talk by Greg K-H, "Documentation/CodingStyle and Beyond"
o OLS 2002 talk by myself, "Porting Drivers to HP ZX1"
It helps to "enforce" driver quality through "anal IO Error containment"
but it's too late when it happens on a customer box.

agreed.

parisc and ia64 will also bus abort. And then HPMC/MCA respectively.
We could reserve a "safe page" and then hand that back I guess.
But that sounds like a very broken error containment strategy to me.
(ie outbound data will be garbage).
This really isn't an issue for HP ZX1/IA64 since most drivers (64-bit)
can bypass the IOMMU and directly address memory. parisc-linux still
isn't commercially interesting.

I didn't know about pci_dma_error.
Google found two references: One is:

<search 2.6.2-rc2 source tree>
grundler <502>find -name '*.[chS]' | xargs fgrep pci_dma_error
./include/asm-x86_64/pci.h:#define pci_dma_error(x) ((x) ==
bad_dma_address)
grundler <503>
That explains why most drivers don't use it yet.
It's only supported on one arch.
Maybe propose this to linux-pci mailing list?
