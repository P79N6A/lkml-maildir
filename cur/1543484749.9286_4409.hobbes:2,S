I tested Stephen's patch but performance of a compile run which normally
takes 20s dropped to nearly 3 minutes in the worst case and 1:10 minutes
average!!!
Went back to my quick refile_buffer patch (in fs/buffer.c), which takes
care of 5% free buffers:
-                       if (nr_buffers_type[BUF_DIRTY] > too_many)
-                               wakeup_bdflush(0);
+                       if (nr_buffers_type[BUF_DIRTY] > too_many ||
+                            nr_buffers - nr_buffers_type[BUF_DIRTY] -
+                            nr_buffers_type[BUF_LOCKED]
+                            < nr_buffers_type[BUF_DIRTY] / 20)
+                               wakeup_bdflush(1);
Performance is _much_ better with it.
The test compile needs 58s in the worst case and 27s average!
All test runs done multiple times while "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/v/l bs=1024k"
on a 13G device was running.
Please give it a try.
