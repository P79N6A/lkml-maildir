This little test app is fun.
I run it all on a single CPU under `taskset -c 0' on the 8-way and it still
causes 160,000 context switches per second and takes 9.5 seconds (after
s/100000/1000).
The kernel has
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y
# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL is not set
and when I switch that to
CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL is not set
the context switch rate falls to zilch and total runtime falls to 6.4
seconds.
Presumably the same problem will occur with CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY on
uniprocessor kernels.
<thinks>
What we effectively have is 32 threads on a single CPU all doing
	for (ever) {
		down_write()
		up_write()
		down_read()
		up_read();
	}
and rwsems are "fair".  So
  thread A                                     thread B
  down_write();
  cond_resched()
  ->schedule()
                                               down_read() -> blocks
  up_write()
  down_read()
  up_read()
  down_write() -> there's a reader: block
                                               down_read() -> succeeds
                                               up_read()
                                               down_write() -> there's another down_writer: block
  down_write() -> succeeds
  up_write()
  down_read() -> there's a down_writer: block
                                               down_write() succeeds
                                               up_write()
                                               down_read() -> succeeds
                                               up_read()
                                               down_write() -> there's a down_reader: block
  down_read() succeeds
ad nauseum.
If that cond_resched() was not there, none of this would ever happen - each
thread merrily chugs away doing its ups and downs until it expires its
timeslice.  Interesting, in a sad sort of way.
Setting CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE doesn't appear to make any difference to
context switch rate or runtime when all eight CPUs are used, so this
phenomenon is unlikely to be involved in the mysql problem.
I wonder why a similar thing doesn't happen when more than one CPU is used.
