I have 2.2.2 installed on several machines all with at least 128meg ram.
some have 256 m. Each have apache 1.3.3 running and perl 5.005-02 running.
It seems that no matter how much memory I install, the httpd processes will
simply start eating memory up until the perl interpreter says cannot load
interpreter. This process may take 1 -3 days of continuious running. looking
at the process list, it will show anywhere from 100-300 processes running at
one time. Now I know that each httpd request creates a certain number of
processes, but arent those processes supposed to free themselves after a
certain period of time - or am i under the wrong impression here? Do I have
a kernel problem here or is this an apache problem? This is causing me to
bite my nails down to the knubs so any help here would be appreciated !
