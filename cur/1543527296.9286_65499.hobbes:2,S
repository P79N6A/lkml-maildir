Use of "tag: data" is bad because it encourages spelling "fixes"
and other stupid tweaks. Lists of values are great, as long as
they don't contain strings with ambiguous whitespace. Files with
only one value are slow.

All numbers should be leading-zero hex, with spaces used to pad lines
out to a power of two. :-) Then I could treat the data as binary.

Can you suggest a good tool? I suppose kernel time is of interest,
along with user-space stack traces, etc.

The C utilities would be much faster. You can forget about the
time required to start them, since it only happens once.
The sysctl program, for example, can read in a whole file of
settings to load.

The kernel version must be carefully checked already.
BTW, one can make all values be 64-bit right from the start.

Security fixes for procps are very rare. There is no need to
run procps tools setuid -- if you do, STOP RIGHT NOW. It is
only overflows caused by data in /proc that are of concern.
Well, no change there. It happens with ASCII too.

Huh? Perl takes 10x as long to write and runs much slower.

This is why the sysctl program can read a file full of values.
