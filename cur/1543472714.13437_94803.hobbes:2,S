1. How does writing zeroes or random bytes three times help more than writing
zero/random bytes ONCE? One could be concerned about some parts of the
file_to_be_deleted being in core, but I can't comprehend how writing zeros
thrice can take care of this.
2. Problem with "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdaX..." is that is INTERRUPTIBLE.
Now, considering that this would take a long time on even a humbly sized HDD, I
don't think the DoD is going to be happy with this :-(
A better way instead of proceeding to go "linearly" to wipe of /dev/hdaX, would
be to write zeros to different parts of the disk (maybe the most recently used
parts first?), thereby inflicting more damage per unit time.
