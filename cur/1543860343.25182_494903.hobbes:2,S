The printk might be too verbose. I think removing them is ok
since the only thing that has happened is that it prevents
entering the loop and the semaphores. The only thing that bugs me
is if list_empty can be used like that. (in other words: don't we
need semaphores around that).

It doesn't flag it. I am working on that.

main-irq-enable-detection-and-disable-again.patch is working
great. I love to see that one included in the kernel.
