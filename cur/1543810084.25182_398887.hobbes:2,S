No, the interface is currently broken. The driver core does not dictate
what values are valid or invalid. It is meant to be used by the bus
drivers to help provide a simiar interface as each other, and to reduce
duplicate code.
It should not be filtering the value. Period. That is a policy decision,
and what is worse, is that it is a static, hard-coded policy decision. The
decision to only accept "0", "2", or "3" is a decision that should be made
on a bus-by-bus basis.

Yup, and it starts with the core not deciding what values are wrong or
right.
