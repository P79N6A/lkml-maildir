The BKL, unless used unbalanced, can never cause a bug.
It could be insufficient or superfluous, but never be really buggy in itself.

I don't speak for Greg, but in this example it could be dropped IMO.
The spinlock protects the critical section anyway. As a rule, if you
do a kmalloc without GFP_ATOMIC under BKL you are doing either insufficient
locking (you may need a semaphore) or useless locking.
This should have been posted on linux-usb long ago.
