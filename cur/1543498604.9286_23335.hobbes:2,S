Reading Andreas Bombe's message (I am not subscribed to lkml due to
mailbox overload) in the archives, I have to clarify some points:
* It's right that my TILynx driver is just a some-line-code skeleton which
  does effectively nothing.
* It's NOT right that I have come nowhere. In fact, I have a working
  subsystem (there are some points I dislike about it but it works)
  and a working AIC-5800 driver. The AIC driver does outgoing and
  receiving transactions without problems.
* One person got IP packets over this driver.
I have searched long for somebody who can help me doing the stuff and,
most important, write a TILynx driver. I started the effort as a
university project which is now finished. I study and work at the same
time and so there is too little time to do it alone. 
So, I am glad that Andreas Bombe joins the Linux IEEE-1394 effort, but I
strongly disagree on his idea of leaving all work and experience behind
and doing everything again. So I suggest
* we get together and design a subsystem that does what we want
* we then see what we have and how to migrate existing code 
* we use existing infrastructure (webspace, mailing lists, CVS) as it is 
  already established.
* the TILynx chip may be important to many people including Andreas,
  but in fact this chip is deprecated and not produced any more. 
  TI now produces and sells OHCI boards.
Andreas> You may have come considerably fast now. Same did I. But the
more difficult part comes later. I am not sure what happens to me (as
regarding my studying of computer science) in the next time. It's looking
bright for at least the next half year to reinforce my efforts but I don't
know what's coming then. Therefore it is very important that other people
like Andreas are present.
By responding to this mail, please CC to my address.
Best regards,
Emanuel
