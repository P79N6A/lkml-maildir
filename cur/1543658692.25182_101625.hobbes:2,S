kernel 2.5.55
USB support & OHCI-HCD compiled in
scsi support compiled in
scsi disk support as a module
usb-storage as a module
no devfs
ASUS P4S533 (SiS645DX chipset)
P4 2GHz

SanDisk SDDR-77 ImageMate Dual Card Reader (using only CF)
Writing to the card sometimes hangs the process when unmounting 
Sometimes the data IS written to the card first, then it hangs the process.
Sometimes the card is corrupt (cannot cd to the mountpoint -I/O error)
  /var/log/messages has several lines like:
  Jan  9 13:08:51 Master kernel: FAT: Filesystem panic (dev sd(8,1))
  Jan  9 13:08:51 Master kernel:     Directory 4: invalid cluster chain
Sometimes get kernel panic with ONLY these 2 lines:
  "Error handler thread not present at f7a57000 f7bf0d80 drivers/scsi/scsi-error.c 154"
  "In interrupt handler - not syncing"
  No messages in logs
