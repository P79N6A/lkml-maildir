kernel-doc supports macros that look like functions.  E.g., from
include/linux/kernel.h:
/**
 * container_of - cast a member of a structure out to the containing structure
 * @ptr:	the pointer to the member.
 * @type:	the type of the container struct this is embedded in.
 * @member:	the name of the member within the struct.
 *
 */
#define container_of(ptr, type, member) ({			\
	const typeof( ((type *)0)->member ) *__mptr = (ptr);	\
	(type *)( (char *)__mptr - offsetof(type,member) );})
However, it does not supports simple macros that are just value names
like your example.  But it does support enums, so you could possibly
change the #defined values to enums and have kernel-doc for them.
Or we could see what it would take to support simple macro values
in kernel-doc...
