Thanks for doing this. Nitpick: this should be all one patch, or at most 3
patches (then each of the below 3 items would become individual changelogs).
Each patch should have a unique changelog, each should have a unique subject
(sans the sequence number).
cc'ing Andrew is also a good idea, if you want them to get merged ;)
One coding style comment:
if (...)
     multi line
         statement
Could use braces around the outermost if statement, for clarity.
