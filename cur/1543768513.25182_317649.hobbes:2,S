Probably you need another loop here for iterating thr' all the
threads of a task? do_each_thread/while_each_thread macros give
the details.
Basically the macros can be modified as:
set $tasks_off=((size_t)&((struct task_struct *)0)->tasks)
set $pid_off=((size_t)&((struct task_struct *)0)->pids[1].pid_list.next)
set $init_t=&init_task
set $next_t=(((char *)($init_t->tasks).next) - $tasks_off)
while ($next_t != $init_t)
set $next_t=(struct task_struct *)$next_t
printf "\n%s:\n", $next_t.comm
printf "PID = %d\n", $next_t.pid
printf "Stack dump:\n"
x/40x $next_t.thread.esp
set $next_th=(((char *)$next_t->pids[1].pid_list.next) - $pid_off)
while ($next_th != $next_t)
set $next_th=(struct task_struct *)$next_th
printf "\n%s:\n", $next_th.comm
printf "PID = %d\n", $next_th.pid
printf "Stack dump:\n"
x/40x $next_th.thread.esp
set $next_th=(((char *)$next_th->pids[1].pid_list.next) - $pid_off)
end
set $next_t=(char *)($next_t->tasks.next) - $tasks_off
end
