Hi there,
I'm using ROCK Linux, which is built with devfs, originally Kernel
2.4.0-test9. This problem occurs, when I want to boot some Kernel after
2.4.0-test9, whereas building and installing the Kernel never is a problem.
I enabled devfs support as well as the mounting of devfs at bootup in the
configuration, just as it is with my "default"Kernel, next, I played around
with lilo.conf (under normal circumstances a make bzlilo without any
playing-around should do it, shouldn't it?)
Then, as this also did show no success I tried passing root=/.....
devfs=mount (<= don't nail me on this one, but I'm sure I did it the right
way) at the LILO boot prompt.
Whole story. Point. That's all. When trying to mount the root he hangs with
"Kernel Panic: I have no root and I want to scream." Poor Kernel.
Hope this helps anyone except me in any way (or perhaps I'm just too
stupid).
Best Regards, Raphael
