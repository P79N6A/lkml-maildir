well the lzrw3.c sourcefile says this algorithm is unpatented and the
code in the public domain... same info basically at the website above.
anyway, as the release notes for 4.00 say, the software compression
code is only still there for reading back old tapes (created with v3);
for new tapes it is not supported anymore.
so removing it if really legal problems crop up should not be a
problem in some time (I think?)?
