Ugh.  
So the death in __put_task_struct() is from:
WARN_ON(!(tsk->exit_state & (EXIT_DEAD | EXIT_ZOMBIE)));
So it appears we have something that is decrementing but not
incrementing the count on the task struct.
Now what is interesting is that there are a couple of other failure modes
present here.
free_uid called from __put_task_struct is failing
And you seem to have a recursive page fault going on somewhere.
I suspect the triggering of this bug is the result of an earlier oops,
that left some process half cleaned up.
Have you tested 2.6.18-rc6 without my patch?
If not can you please test the same 2.6.18-rc6 configuration with my patch?

So I don't know what is going on with your laptop.  It feels nasty.
I think my patch is just tripping on the problem, rather than causing
it.  The previous version of fs/proc/base.c should have tripped over
this problem as well if it happened to have hit the same process.
I'm staring at the patch and I can not think of anything that would
explain your problem.  The reference counting is simple and the only
bug I had in a posted version was a failure to decrement the count
on the task_struct.
I guess the practical question is what was your test methodology to
reproduce this problem?  A couple of more people running the same
test on a few more machines might at least give us confidence in what
is going on.
