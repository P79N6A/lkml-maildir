Subject: Correct rmdir behavior

I'm in the process of revivifying a user space filesystem I wrote for
2.0 kernels several years ago.  I have a simple pass through
filesystem basically working.  However, if I run a busy loop such as
while true
do
    ls -l >/dev/null
done
in a directory within the filesystem and then do a rmdir on that
directory, strange behavior follows.  The directory is indeed removed.
I can then create a new directory with the same name as the deleted
directory, but if I then try to create any files or directories within
the new directory I fail.  VFS traffic shows that lookups are made for
the files or directories I try to create but no create or mkdir calls.
It appears that some artifacts are left either in the inode cache or
the dentry cache.  I'm not sure, but I believe that the problem lies in
my inode_operations::rmdir function which I list below.  If I insert a
if (!d_unhashed(entry))
{
    return -EBUSY;
}
into the code, as coda does, I am forbidden from deleting a directory
in which processes are active.  Any clues as to how to handle rmdir so
that I get ext2 behavior?  TIA for any help.
