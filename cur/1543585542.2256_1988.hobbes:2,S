Actually, the right thing to do would be to drop the ugly tricks with
writing to .../register and use normal create()/write()/close() to add
entries. Commit-on-close and there you go. unlink() to remove these
suckers, chmod g-r to disable.
IOW, instead of
echo ':foo:.......' >register		echo ':.....' > /etc/binfmt_misc/foo
echo '-1' > foo				rm /etc/binfmt_misc/foo
echo '0' > foo				chmod g-r /etc/binfmt_misc/foo
echo '1' > foo				chmod g+r /etc/binfmt_misc/foo
echo '-1' > status			rm /etc/binfmt_misc/*
echo '0' > status			chmod -x /etc/binfmt_misc
echo '1' > status			chmod +x /etc/binfmt_misc
cat status				cat /etc/binfmt_misc/*
Normal behaviour instead of black magic, no checks for duplicate entries,
special names, yodda, yodda - everything would work as one expects from
normal directory. When you want to create a file you create it, not write
an incantation into a magic file. And when you want to remove it, the
last thing you would normally think of is writing "-1" into the victim.
Yes, I know that procfs doesn't allow that. Mark the correct conclusion:
	(A)	procfs is not suitable for the task
	(B)	we should invent a kludgy way to create files, etc. on
		procfs without using normal create() and reimplement the
		sanity checks
	(C)	same as (B), but ignore sanity
Your choice being...?
And yes, I'm quite aware of the fact that we are stuck with the current
kludgy API - compatibility issues and all such. Pity, that...
Al, very unimpressed both with design and implementation of that kludge...
