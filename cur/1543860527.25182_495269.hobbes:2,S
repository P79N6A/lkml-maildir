The Linux PowerPC port uses an OF-like device tree on
*every* platform, even those that don't have a native OF.
It also has to work around lots of bugs in many OF
implementations.  It's doing lots of stuff, and not all
of it is nicely separated into logical modules I'm afraid.

So give them an interface that allows them to hook up to
your new code :-)

Never say never...
