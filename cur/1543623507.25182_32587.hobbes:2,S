	Hi Linus,
	It's now a tradition : here a few patches for you to merge in
the 2.5.6 kernel. A few cleanup that have been waiting for a while,
and a few critical fixes that recently showed up.
	I've asked Jeff if he wanted to be my "Patch Penguin (TM)" for
Linux-IrDA patches, but he was not very enthousiastic about IrDA (I
don't understand why ;-) I'll make seperate patches for Marcello.
	Patches have been tested in 2.5.6-pre2 (SMP). All non critical
patches have been on the IrDA list for more than one month (in
particular all the changes to LAP Tx queue).
        Have fun...
        Jean
[FEATURE] : Add a new feature to the IrDA stack
[CORRECT] : Fix to have the correct/expected behaviour
[CRITICA] : Fix potential kernel crash
ir256_bus_to_virt.diff :
----------------------
	o [CRITICA] Fix ISA FIR drivers for new DMA API
	<PCI FIR drivers are still broken and need fixing>
ir256_sock_connect_cli.diff :
---------------------------
	o [CRITICA] Fix socket connect to remove dangerous cli()
	<Tested on SMP>
ir256_irnet_disc_ind.diff :
-------------------------
	o [CORRECT] Fix IrNET disconnection to not reconnect but
	  instead to hangup pppd
ir256_lap_icmd_fix-4.diff :
-------------------------
	o [CORRECT] Fix Tx queue handling (remove race, keep packets in order)
	o [CORRECT] Synchronise window_size & line_capacity and make sure
	  we never forget to increase them (would stall Tx queue)
	o [FEATURE] Group common code out of if-then-else
	o [FEATURE] Don't harcode LAP header size, use proper constant
	o [FEATURE] Inline irlap_next_state() to decrease bloat
ir256_usb_cow_urballoc.diff :
---------------------------
	o [FEATURE] Don't use skb_cow() unless we really need to
	o [CORRECT] Reorder URB init to avoid races
	o [CORRECT] USB dealy adds processing time, not removes it
        <Following patch from Greg KH <greg@kroah.com> himself !!!>
	o [CRITICA] Use dynamically allocated URBs (instead of statically)
