Just a side note.
I rebooted with elevator=deadline this morning and i didn't experienced any
hard freeze since. Uptime is about 8 hours now ( both former freezes were with
elevator=as)
No xmms audio skips, very good overall feel, very good responsiveness
(openoffice,mozilla, news feed update,etc..)
Thanks,
Philippe
