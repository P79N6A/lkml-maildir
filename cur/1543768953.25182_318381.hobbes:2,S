Dear diary, on Fri, May 13, 2005 at 05:29:30PM CEST, I got a letter
where Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com> told me that...

Would it be a big problem to use refs/heads/$branch? That's the
currently commonly agreed convention about location for storing branch
heads, not just some weird Cogito-specific invention. And it'd be very
nice to have those locations consistent across git repositories.
Thanks,
