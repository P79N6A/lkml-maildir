that's the anonmm:

I don't see how this can work, each vma needs its own vm_off or a single
address space can't handle them all. Also the page->index is the virtual
address (or the virtual offset with anon_vma), it cannot be replaced
with something global, it has to be per-page.

the object is to cover ranges, instead of forcing per-page overhread.
Being finegrined at the vma is fine, being finegrined less than a vma is
desiderable only if there's no downside.

As I said in the last email the prio_tree will not work for the
anonvmas, because every vma in the same range will map to different
pages. So you'll find more vmas than the ones you're interested about.
This doesn't happen with inodes. with inodes every vma queued into the
i_mmap will be mapping to the right page _if_ it's pte_present == 1.
with your anonymous address space shared by childs the prio_tree will
find lots of vmas in different vma->vm_mm, each one pointing to
different pages. so to unmap a direct page after a malloc, you may end
up scanning all the address spaces by mistake. This cannot happen with
anon_vma. Furthermore the prio_tree will waste 12 bytes per vma, while
the anon_vma design will waste _at_most_ 8 bytes per vma (actually less
if the anon_vma are shared). And with anon_vma in practice you won't
need a prio_tree stacked on top of anon_vma. You could put one if you
want paying another 12bytes per vma, but it doesn't worth it. So
anon_vma takes less memory and it's more efficent as far as I can tell.

Reusing the same code would be good I agree, but I don't think it would
work as well as with the inodes, and with the inodes it's really needed
only for a special 32bit case, so normally the lookup would be immdiate,
while here we need it for real expensive lookups if one has many
anonymous vmas in the childs even on 64bit apps. So I prefer a design
where the prio_tree or not the cost for good apps 64bit archs is the
same. prio_tree is not free, it's still O(log(N)) and I prefer a design
where the common case is N == 1 like with anon_vma (with your
address-space design N would be >1 normally in a server app).
