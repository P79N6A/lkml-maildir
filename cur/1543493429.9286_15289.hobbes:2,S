Hi!
I saw that you have a Dual Pentium II machine, too.
Could you please try out, how long a 
sleep 10 
lasts? On my machine it lasts 55 seconds. Strange, isn't it?
To try out, please use a separate clock, because when I try out things
like
date; sleep 10 ; date
I will get a difference of 10 seconds between the dates, in spite of the
fact it needs 55 seconds to finish...
I have got a Dual Pentium II 400 with linux 2.2.6 SMP kernel.
My mainboard is an Asus P2B-DS.
Greetings, Michael
PS: Maybe, my machine is really fast, but I don't believe in
relativistic effects... ;-)
