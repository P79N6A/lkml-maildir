So what? We still create new things, which work better than old ones
even if it requires 'to reinvent the wheel'.
It was shown too many times already why kqueue api can not be used in
Linux.
Btw, if you want someone to rewrite something, you can start with mmaped
based malloc for example. Why don't you want to do it - although API is
the same, but underlying logic is different.

According to my tests kevent is noticebly faster.
It is already too big flag that old system should not be used.
And half of my previous mail to you shows why kevent is better/different
from kqueue.
