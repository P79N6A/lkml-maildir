This kind of "breaks" are not so fatal provided that there is some way to
detect them reliably. Usually it's possible to check LINUX_VERSION_CODE
and use different approaches depending on the kernel version. However
this doesn't always work because distribution vendors often back port
features from the newer kernels into their distribution kernels which
have older LINUX_VERSION_CODE. A better  approach would be marking them
with #define HAVE_NEW_something in the header file that implements this
change.
In the long term frequent changes in kernel interfaces cause problems
because drivers that try to stay compatible with as many kernel versions
as possible will start looking like #ifdef spaghetti.
