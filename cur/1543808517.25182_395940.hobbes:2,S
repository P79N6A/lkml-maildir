It isn't about load. You issue a command to an ATA device and there is
no disconnect sequence as SCSI has. That bus is now locked until the
command completes.
There are mechanisms for certain cases like blanking and fixating that
allow you to avoid this. Some cd record apps let you choose them.  There
isn't anything the kernel can do however.
