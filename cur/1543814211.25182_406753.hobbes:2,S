The following is what I propose to add the the manpages entry for
ptrace(2).  Some of it came from experimentation, some from linux-kernel
messages and the rest came from reading the source code.
       PTRACE_GETSIGINFO
              Retrieve  information  about  the  signal  that caused the stop.
              Copies a siginfo_t from the child to location data in  the  par-
              ent.
       PTRACE_SETSIGINFO
              Set signal information.  Copies a siginfo_t from  location  data
              in the parent to the child.
       PTRACE_SETOPTIONS
              Sets  ptrace  options  from  data in the parent.  data is inter-
              preted as a bitmask of options, which are specified by the  fol-
              lowing (addr is ignored:)
              PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD
                     When  delivering  syscall  traps, set bit 7 in the signal
                     number (i.e. deliver (SIGTRAP | 0x80)  This makes it easy
                     for  the  tracer  to  tell  the difference between normal
                     traps and those caused by a syscall.
              PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK
                     Stop the child at the next fork()  call  with  SIGTRAP  |
                     PTRACE_EVENT_FORK  <<  8  and automatically start tracing
                     the  newly  forked  process,  which  will  start  with  a
                     SIGSTOP.   The  pid  for the new process can be retrieved
                     with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.
              PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK
                     Stop the child at the next vfork() call  with  SIGTRAP  |
                     PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK  <<  8 and automatically start tracing
                     the the newly vforked process, which will  start  with  a
                     SIGSTOP.   The  pid  for the new process can be retrieved
                     with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.
              PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE
                     Stop the child at the next clone() call  with  SIGTRAP  |
                     PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE  <<  8 and automatically start tracing
                     the  newly  cloned  process,  which  will  start  with  a
                     SIGSTOP.   The  pid  for the new process can be retrieved
                     with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.
              PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC
                     Stop the child at the next exec()  call  with  SIGTRAP  |
                     PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC << 8.
              PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORKDONE
                     Stop the child at the completion of the next vfork() call
                     with SIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE << 8.
              PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT
                     Stop the child at exit with SIGTRAP  |  PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT
                     <<  8.   The  childs  exit  status can be retrieved with
                     PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.  This stop will be done early  during
                     process  exit  whereas  the  normal  notification is done
                     after the process is done exiting.
       PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG
              Retrieve a message (as an unsigned long) about the ptrace  event
              that  just  happened  to  the  location data in the parent.  For
              PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT  this  is  the   childs   exit   code.    For
              PTRACE_EVENT_FORK,   PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK  and  PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE
              this is the pid of the new process.
       PTRACE_SYSEMU, PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP
              For  PTRACE_SYSEMU,  continue  and  stop  on  entry  to the next
              syscall, which will not  be  executed.   For  PTRACE_SYSEMU_SIN-
              GLESTEP, so the same but also singlestep if not a syscall.
