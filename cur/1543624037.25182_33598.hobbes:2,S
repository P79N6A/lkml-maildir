It's due to preemption and Ingo's great O(1)-scheduler.
BIO should help, too but throughput isn't were it should be...;-)
You can get this when you apply preemption+lock-break, O(1) and Andrew 
Morten's low-latency to 2.4.18, too.
-aa (vm_29) deliver additional throughput.
If you are running under KDE you should try 3.0 beta2 or -rc2 (!!!)
It flies then.
