If root has explicitly stated that the thread in question is the highest 
priority thing on the entire machine, why would it not be okay.  The 
fact that root made a mistake is the issue here, not that the system 
didn't protect itself.

Yes.  But at the same time, if root wants to do something, the kernel 
should let them.  There are many, many ways that root could trash the 
system.  "cat /dev/urandom > /dev/kcore"  would do quite nicely.

Not necessarily.  The latest latency-reduction patches allow root to 
specify exactly what the priorities should be.

There are professionals who use linux for audio as well, it's not just 
home systems.  That said, you unify them with reasonable defaults, and 
the ability for root to override them.
