Yes, you were the "apparently" that I cited :)
I just wondered if Ingo has or has seen numbers that make
him dislike this way of doing it.
I would have thought that the spinlock structure and code bloat,
and the lock break checks in fast paths would be the far greater
cost of lockbreak than what Hugh's patch adds. But real numbers
are pretty important when it comes to this kind of thing.
