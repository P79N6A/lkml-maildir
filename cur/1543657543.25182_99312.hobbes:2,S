The interfaces for the 2.4 and 2.5 xconfig systems are completely
different.
For 2.4, I think it's a very bad idea to not to show the greyed-out
options, because a switch disabling all of them is set.  Having a
switch to disable, for example, all of the power management options is
useful, because they are amoungst other options, and I can just ignore
them and scroll past quickly and easily.
I think it would be a big waste of time if we have to start toggling
options just to see which options are being hidden.
For 2.5, each subcategory can be 'collapsed', so this problem doesn't
really occur.
John.
