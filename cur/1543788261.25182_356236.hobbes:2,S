Dear Friend 
I am Brian Marzhan and I represent Mr. Mikhail Khordokovsky the former C.E.O 
of Yukos Oil Company in Russia. I have a very sensitive and confidential 
brief 
from him to ask for your partnership in re-profiling funds in a private bank 
investment portfolio in Western Europe. I will give the details, but in 
summary, the 
funds are coming via Bank Menatep in Russia. 
This is a legitimate transaction. You will be paid 5% of the portfolio 
investment value as your "management fees". If you are interested, please 
write back to 
me via my private E-mail and provide me with your confidential telephone 
number, 
fax number and email address and I will provide further details and if you 
are 
satisfied I can proceed with the instructions. 
l suggest that you contact me only  via my  private email:  
brianbaconevans@compaqnet.fr
Please we can not afford any political problems because of recent events in 
Russia. So I will advice you keep this to your self.Finally, please note 
that this 
must be concluded within reasonable time frame therefore your prompt reply 
is 
essential. 
Write me back. I look forward to it. 
Brian Marzhan
