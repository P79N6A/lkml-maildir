Understood. I'm more than a little embarrassed that these keep getting 
obvious errors that didn't appear in my own testing. I guess my only 
excuse is that these patches consistently get put on the back burner and 
get revisited when someone asks me about them. Unfortunately, sometimes 
it means I end up finding patches on my development nodes that have been 
obsoleted by versions that I've fixed already.
Ugh.
