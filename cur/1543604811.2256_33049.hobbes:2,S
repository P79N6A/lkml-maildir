hi all,
i've got a setup of 2 hard drives (30GB & 40GB) with an Asus a7m266 mobo 
with a VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586 IDE [Apollo] (rev 06).
30GB= fujitsu, 40GB= IBM (both are 7200rpm
i've got my cdrw on /dev/hdc, 30GB=/dev/hda, and 40GB=/dev/hdb...
all works alright for a while, but when i keep my computer turned on for 
a couple of days and then reboot. bios sometimes tells me that smart 
array (or something) failed with my primary master (30GB) and i should 
back-up soon.. next reboot it tells me that pri-master fails.. it's 
doing this quite regularly and i don't know how to stop it. i'm running 
kernel 2.4.12 vanilla.
i'm sorry guys if this is the wrong place to ask but i could use some 
hints in probably adding some options to the kernel at compile(config) 
time to aid my ailing box.
