Okay the original version of the patch was included in -ac5.
Thanks, Alan.  I'll submit a new patch against -ac5 with the
improved error handling.  I think I'll work a bit on examining
the status returned by the BIOS and providing some printk feedback
in the event of an error.  (get_dev_node shouldn't ever return
anything but 0, and if it does then something is wrong.)
Cheers
