uClibc fails because it tries to grep for UTS_RELEASE in
linux/version.h and doesn't find it because it's been moved to
linux/utsrelease.h. I can update the script so that it checks
linux/utsrelease.h first, but that file is not installed by
make headers_install.
Should utsrelease.h be added to objhdr-y or should uClibc handle this
some other way?
