Last time my 486 had 'bad memory' it was actually an Ethernet card which 
had mapped it's buffers at D000 (32k or 64k worth) and I'd get wierd 
network errors and errors gunzipping and such ehehe :)
Anyway, something to check.  I had no idea that the thing was mapped and 
indeed it ran fine most of the time with it like this, just it seemed to 
show up onece in a while as corrupt .zip/.gz's or a compile that went 
wonky.
My $.02 worth.
