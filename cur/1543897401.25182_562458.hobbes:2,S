That the fact that an IOMMU can do SG for non-SG-capble cards is not
interesting from a "reason for inclusion" POV.

Yup. I'm working on it (mostly in the context of Calgary) but also
looking at improvements to the DMA-API interface and usage.

Calgary already does this internally (via calgary=disable=<BUSNUM>)
but that's pretty ugly. It would be better to do it in a generic
fashion when deciding which dma_ops to call (i.e., a dma_ops per bus
or device).

Is anyone working on it?
