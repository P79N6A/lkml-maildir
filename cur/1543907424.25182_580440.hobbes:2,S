Well, on my box (nx6325) with the appended (experimental) patch applied
on top of 2.6.23-rc1 with the patchset from
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.23-rc2/patches/
 , the
double spin down doesn't occur during hibernation and the system is shut down
notceably faster.
Greetings,
Rafael
