	   I just wanted to let you folks know that
   linux-2.3.41/drivers/char/mxser.c does not compile, because it uses
   some private declarations in <linux/serialP.h> that are no longer
   pulled in, such as SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE and struct asnc_icount.  I can
   send you a patch to make it compile by including <linux/serialP.h>,
   although I am not sure if this is correct, because I am not quite
   sure of the purpose of the <linux/serialP.h> file.
The best way to deal with this is to #include <linux/serialP.h> in
mxser.c.
serialP.h is an internal "private" header file for the serial driver,
and for those drivers which are developed by grabbing serial.c and
lightly tweaking it.  I removed SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE and struct async_icount
from serial.h and moved them to serialP.h since they should only be used
by the driver internally.
Note: In the future (i.e., post 2.4) it's likely that things like
async_icount will move to tty.h, and the code for handling it will be
moved to tty_io.c, so that different drivers can share the code instead
of sharing it by cut-and-paste.
