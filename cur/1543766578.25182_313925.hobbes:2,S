Then that might explain the "bug" that we're seeing with get_user_pages().  We've been 
assuming that get_user_pages() mappings are permanent.
Well, I was just about to re-implement get_user_pages() support in our driver to 
demonstrate the bug.  I guess I'll hold off on that.
If you look at the Infiniband code that was recently submitted, I think you'll see it does 
exactly that: after calling mlock(), the driver calls get_user_pages(), and it stores the 
page mappings for future use.
