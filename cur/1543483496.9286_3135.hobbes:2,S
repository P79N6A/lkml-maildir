    I've got an AMD K6/3D 300MHz Stepping A processor that seems to periodically
Seg11. I'm currently running RedHat 5.2 and am wondering if this behavior will get
better/worse if I up it to 2.2.1. The thing seems to run fast (599 BOGOMips) but I
can't count on it with Linux. NT (of all things) didn't have this problem.
    thanx & later,
        Ben Scherrey
