Hello everyone,
HP has generously donated a ProLiant DL385 to replace our current 
master.kernel.org machine, which was donated several years ago by AmNet. 
  This upgrade should help with the additional load of quite a few 
people running git has put on the machine, as well as help with overall 
stability.
Starting at 11:00 PST/19:00 UTC this coming Saturday, February 4, we 
will taking the old machine down; the new machine will come online after 
  everything has been carefully rsynced over.  This should hopefully be 
quick, but just in case, expect a several hour outage.
Public services will not be affected; only mail and upload services will 
be down.
Huge thanks to HP for the donation, and to Bdale Garbee and Matt Taggart 
for organizing it at that end.
