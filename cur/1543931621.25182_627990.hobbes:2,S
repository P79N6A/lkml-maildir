    ACPI: thinkpad-acpi: fix lenovo keymap for brightness
    
    Starting in 2.6.23...
    
    Several reports from X60 users complained that the default Lenovo keymap
    issuing EV_KEY KEY_BRIGHTNESS_UP/DOWN input events caused major issues when
    the proper brightness support through ACPI video.c was loaded.
    
    Therefore, remove the generation of these events by default, which is the
    right thing for T60, X60, R60, T61, X61 and R61 with their latest BIOSes.
    
    Distros that want to misuse these events into OSD reporting (which requires
    an ugly hack from hell in HAL) are welcome to set up the key map they need
    through HAL.  That way, we don't break everyone else's systems.

commit 98934def70b48dac74fac3738b78ab2d1a28edda

    ACPI: video_device_list corruption
    
    The ->cap fields of struct acpi_video_device and struct acpi_video_bus
    are 1B each, not 4B. The oversized memset()'s corrupted the subsequent
    list_head fields. This resulted in silent corruption without
    CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST and BUG's with it. This patch uses sizeof() to pass
    the proper bounds to the memset() calls and thereby correct the bugs.

    ACPI: battery: fix ACPI battery technology reporting
    
    At least some systems report technology information with trailing spaces:
    
    {pts/1}% cat -E /var/tmp/bat/2.6.23 | grep type
    battery type:            Li-ION  $
    
    Use strncasecmp to compare model string to skip trailing part
