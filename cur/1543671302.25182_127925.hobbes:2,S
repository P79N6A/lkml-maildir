Maybe your problem is in the kernel, maybe not.  hdb is an IBM 80 Gig?  Be afraid, those drives are notorious for going bad.  Yesterday a similar model randomly ate half a partition then lost its boot sector for a couple hours.  Today I can run a write mode badblocks with no errors to be found.
Hope you make backups.
