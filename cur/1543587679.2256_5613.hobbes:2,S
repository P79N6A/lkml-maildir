You of course, are commenting from the fact that your applications are
stupid, written poorly, and cannot handle 'wrapped' data.  Take MRTG
as one example of a good application, for it can handle counters that
have been cleared between reads.

No, but i realize that if my time has incremented, and my date has not
changed, then it's later.  If my time has _decremented_ and my date has not,
then I've time-warped.  If my time has decremented and my date has
incremented,
then it's simply the next-date-increment.
Similarly, if my InPackets are at 102345 at one read, and 2345 the next
read,
and I know that my counter is 32 bits, then I know i've wrapped and can do
my
own math.
Applications need to get smarter.  Don't place arbitrary rules where they
don't
belong.
