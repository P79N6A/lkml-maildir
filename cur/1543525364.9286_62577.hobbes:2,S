I see real-world use of capabilities evolving in 3 stages
1) Processes voluntarily dropping capabilities. This is the stage we are
at now, and things like "bind" and "xntpd" will benefit from this. People
doing this work have hit the major stumbing block that kicked off this
thread (cannot drop uid==0 after dropping capabilities). I've sent Linus
the fixing patch.
2) Filesystem support goes in, but typical usage will be to just use the
"forced" support, to keep traditional UNIX privilege inheritance but run
suid root program with finer grained privilege. Note that stage 2) is by
no means a configuration/maintenance problem
3) The "allowed" filesystem set may or may not see usage. As mentioned,
using the "allowed" sets is a setup/maintenance pain.
The key point of this three stage plan is that at stage 2), you are
reaping benefits from filesystem capabilities without the hassle of
binaries not inheriting privilege in the traditional UNIX way
Cheers
