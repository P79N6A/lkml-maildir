  Marcello,
 I posted output of scanpci -v here:
    
http://www.calarndt.com/uploads/scanpci.txt
    
http://www.calarndt.com/uploads/lspci.txt
  I also posted the contents of the modified
    /usr/src/linux-2.4.24/kernel
    
http://www.calarndt.com/uploads/kernel.tar.gz
    I'm a newbie at this so if there's anything else I could post that would be helpful as well
 please let me know.
 Thanks,
Cal...
