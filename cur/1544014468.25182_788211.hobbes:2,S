Curiously strong opinions when I've already demonstrated otherwise.  On
my system, and possibly also on yours, a time_t, which is what time()
returns, is the number of seconds since epoch; which, in turn, is the
start of 1970.  And on my system, zoneinfo handles leap seconds.
Just saying that I'm wrong is contrary and stubborn since evidence shows
my understanding has been correct from the start.  If you're sure I'm
wrong, take my demonstration and find a flaw.  Otherwise I little value
in your contribution to this discussion.

Don't believe everything you read.  For example, the time(2) man page
says what POSIX does, but doesn't actually say that Linux also does the
same.  It also says what you paraphrased above, but demonstrably that's
not the case.  Man pages often are wrong in some details.  Hence RTSL.

Yesterday, when I scanned the RFC, it was clear that NTP broadcasts do
not factor leap seconds; that every day has 86400 seconds.  However if
NTP does have a way of distributing leap seconds, other than the almost
pointless leap-second flag, then that's great.     If it doesn't (which
is what I understand), there's no problem anyway (as explained.)

So you say, but you have no code to back you  up, whereas I do.
