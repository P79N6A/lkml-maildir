Hi Andrea,
Why do you continue to seem to ignore the CPU write buffers, or just seem
to say they should not make differences, and fall into complex
explanations?  Manfred's example was broken because of you both ignoring
the CPU write buffers, in my opinion. I may be wrong for that one, but let
me tell you that as long as you will ignore the CPU write buffers you will
stay in confusion in my opinion. 
There are similar things in PCI used for posted writes. Will you beleive
me if I tell you that as seen from my planet numerous PCI device drivers
are broken because of ignoring (or bad understanding) these buffers and
just work in a cross-fingered way due to bus activity, chipset flushing
uselessly these buffers on interrupt and only a short window allowing bad
things to happen. On that one, I am sure I am not wrong. ;-) 
Gérard.
Joke: I deal with kind of Asymetric MP since years without locking
      mechanism (PCI). If it happens this to get too complex for my brain
      that will get older, I may elect to switch so simpler things as SMP.
      :-) :o) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
