Hello,
Well, the topic says it all: regardless of whichever USB device I plug in, 
it never shows up as a high-speed one using EHCI even if it damn well 
should, and does work in high-speed mode when plugged into the same 
computer while running Win. Unfortunately the workaround I found on 
kerneltrap by googling, i.e. disabling USB 2.0 in BIOS, doesn't work for 
me, even though I have tried all possible combination of related options 
which didn't shut USB down entriely.
Any chance of having this bug fixed soon? Or maybe, since AFAIK the 
problem did not exist before 2.6.10, there is a patch which one could use 
to temporarily restore old behaviour?
As always, if you need any more information about the system in question 
or any other technical details, just let me know; I'm on LKML again right 
now.
Regards,
