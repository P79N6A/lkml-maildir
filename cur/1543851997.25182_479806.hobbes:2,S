Yes, it's definitely a cool idea.  I think the current implementation
is not that useful, since it jams all the unrelated kernel locks into
a single ordered list, when in fact many locks simply have no ordering
relationship at all because they're never both taken.  This makes the
list hard to read and in fact loses the information of which locks
have been taken together.
