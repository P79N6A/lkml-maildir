Agreed. That "ClearPageUptodate()" thing definitely looks like a bug.

Right now, yes. And that is a bad bug.

Right. Basically we will drop the buffers only after they have been
written out, so normal read/write can never lose data.
It's only the case of shared mmap's that can lose data due to the stupid
"let's read it in from disk again" thing.

Oh, I certainly agree.
And I also agree that we should work on making the "create_page_buffers"
thing more easily used - the code duplication in the different parts of
fs/buffer.c is quite horrible. It tends to be the same kind of logic,
except it has small differences in four-five different versions.
I think it would be better to do the code part first, actually: once that
is done, a single comment above "create_page_buffers" will explain
everything that is going on..

Oh, agreed. I think we should clean up the code. I looked at it yesterday,
and it didn't look all that horribly bad, but I lost interest. I don't
know if it is worth doing before 2.4.x, as the current code certainly
should work with the small changes already proposed.
