Have you tried with pci=noapic?
When I used the 3c59x on my integrated 3Com (on Asus nForce2 board), it
always got to the point that it got the IP, but no traffic was going
through...
(same thing happends with the 3Com 3c90x driver...)
This was solved by either booting with acpi=off or pci=noapic...
