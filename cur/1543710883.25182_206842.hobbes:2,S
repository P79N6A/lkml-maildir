This looks like it wants to be:
#define STACK_PAGE_COUNT	(PAGE_ALIGN(THREAD_SIZE)/PAGE_SIZE)
(There are reasons to want THREAD_SIZE < PAGE_SIZE having to do with
elevating PAGE_SIZE as opposed to shrinking THREAD_SIZE outright.)
It looks like kmap_types.h should inherits PAGE_* from processor.h
which in turn should inherit them from page.h
Did the headers barf on this or something? I can't imagine you didn't
think of it already.
