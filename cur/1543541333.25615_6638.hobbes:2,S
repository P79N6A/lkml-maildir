Version 1.4 of my x86 performance-monitoring counters driver is
now available at 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/.
This is a bug fix and maintenance release only.
Summary of changes since version 1.3:
- Updates to comply which changes in 2.4.0-test kernels, in particular
  concerning module owner and use count tracking, and the Virtual File
  System (VFS) infrastructure.
- A bug which prevented reclaiming VFS resources (dentries and
  inodes) allocated to virtual perfctrs has been fixed. This bug
  affected both 2.2.x and 2.4.0-test kernels.
