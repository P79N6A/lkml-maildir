These messages?  They're coming from the kernel it looks like, from the 
map_devmem routine in pat.c.  I'm not sure they're accurate though; for PCI 
regions /dev/mem is *supposed* to map with UC- and not WB, so maybe this 
function needs to be updated?

This is just a transient issue during VT switch or server exit though, right?  
X functionality isn't affected, and your VTs work fine?  If so, it might not 
be a PAT issue but just a different memory layout or something (and therefore 
it would really just be a cosmetic bug in the X driver).
I really think PAT should be on by default; if you're running into real 
functional or performance problems we'd better get them fixed rather than 
disabling PAT...
Thanks,
