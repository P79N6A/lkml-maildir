I think ext3 limits filenames to 255 or 256 characters.  Other
filesystems probably have other limits.
The POSIX absolute maximum is PATH_MAX for the entire path, which means
that a legal filename could theoretically be PATH_MAX-1 (a file in the
root directory).  But maybe in practice this is never an issue.
We still have the issue where 256 is much larger than the average file.
But, as I have said before, I am _for_ keeping the thing static,
although I acknowledge all the points about going dynamic.
