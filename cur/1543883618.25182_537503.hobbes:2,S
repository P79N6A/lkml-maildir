Actually looking at the code it would need some fixes first:
/*
 * These should really be __section__(".bss.page_aligned") as well, but
 * gcc's 3.0 and earlier don't handle that correctly.
 */
static char softirq_stack[NR_CPUS * THREAD_SIZE]
                __attribute__((__aligned__(THREAD_SIZE)));
static char hardirq_stack[NR_CPUS * THREAD_SIZE]
                __attribute__((__aligned__(THREAD_SIZE)));
With 8K stacks and NR_CPUS==128 that would be 2MB statically reserved. Yuck.
Really needs to be dynamically allocated. I'll take a look once the .22 
big merge is done.
