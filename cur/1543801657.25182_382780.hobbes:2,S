Subject: [PATCH] Disable swsusp on CONFIG_HIGHMEM64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
suspending to disk is not supported on CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G setups 
(
http://suspend2.net/features
). Also suspend to ram doesn't work. This patch 
fixes Kconfig to disallow such combination. I'm not 100% sure about the 
ACPI_SLEEP part, as it might be disabling some working setup - but i think 
that s2r and s2d are the only acpi sleeps allowed, no?
Bye,
	spity
PS: I didn't know that this is not supported so I had some nice oops after 
resume (from ram) and s2d didn't resume at all :-)
