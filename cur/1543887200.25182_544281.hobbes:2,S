First of all, please do not put patches in attachments.
As for the patch, an infinite loop is *much* worse than a panic.
When one is installing a new kernel on remote box, having it
booted with reboot on panic and loader falling back to old
kernel on the next boot is a bloody good idea - gives you extra
safety.  With your patch it will get the box stuck.
