If you look further, you will see, that this was actually rewritten in 2.6.12 
and thats why we have cputime_t. The infrastructure is currently only used by 
s390 and ppc64. On s390 we use our cpu timer to get the current time on each 
syscall/irq/context switch etc to get precise accounting data for 
system/user/irq/softirq/nice. We also get steal time (this is interesting for 
the guest: how much of my cpu was actually not available because the 
hypervisor scheduled me away). I dont know enough about other architectures  
to say which one could exploit this infrastructure as well.
The current git tree is somewhat broken for CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUTING due to 
the accouting changes introduced by CFS - we work on this.
If you are interested in the cputime stuff, you can have a look at 
arch/s390/kernel/vtime.c (account_system_vtime, account_vtime) as well as:

for the s390 exploitation.
