I don't think so. It starts with the ide-cd level driver 
doing 8 retries. Most disk we see retry themselves for about  a 
4 second delay before reporting a bad block. A CD taking twice
that much would not sound abnormal. (seeks are about 10 times
as expensive on CDs). 8 times 8 seconds is a full minute.
