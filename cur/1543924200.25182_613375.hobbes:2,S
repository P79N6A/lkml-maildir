Subject: x86: <asm/sigcontext.h> not exported, but <asm/sigcontext32.h> is?

Anyone happens to know how come, in the x86 tree (and previously in the 
x86-64 tree), <asm/sigcontext.h> is not exported to userspace (but uses 
userspace-compatible typenames), whereas <asm/sigcontext32.h> is?
This is particularly puzzling since at least my version of glibc 
contains an <asm/sigcontext.h> that looks just like the one in the 
kernel, minus a __user and an inclusion of <linux/compiler.h>.
