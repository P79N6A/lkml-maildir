If the block device is unused (as will be the case between your calls to
the program), and you open the device, it will check disk change.  If
the disk has not been changed, then the cache will remain valid.
Whether your cdrom chooses to spin up the drive or not on a
TEST_UNIT_READY command is not a kernel matter!
