I *really* don't think any app is trying to do one of the following:
- open another fd to the same device and delete effect created in the
first fd
- open and close another fd to the same device to delete all effects
The latter one doesn't make any sense (the process could just open and
close the first fd), but the former one is possible, though very unlikely.
I count only 6 programs using linux ff, of which 3 are test programs.
None of those messes up with fd's so that they would depend on the old
behaviour. I would change the behaviour, while we still can.
What we could do is allow deleting effects, whether they're owned by the
fd or not. If they aren't, printk() would be issued.

I try to have a coherent behaviour:
- fd1 opened
- fd1: effects 0, 1 are created
- fd2 opened
- fd2: effects 2, 3 are created
- fd2 closed
=> effects 2, 3 get deleted
- fd1 uses effects
- fd1 closed
=> effects 0, 1 get deleted
I will once again give an example how things would go with the old
behaviour:
- fd1 opened
- fd1: effects 0, 1 are created
- fd2 opened
- fd2: effects 2, 3 are created
- fd2 closed
=> effects 0, 1, 2, 3 get deleted
- fd1 uses effects
=> failure
- fd1 closed
(fd1 and fd2 are of the same process and the same device)
