After some considerable time letting this patch 'age', here's an update
to 2.4.18:
   
http://people.nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/htree-2.4.18
The diff to 2.4.17 was provided by Ted Ts'o, and bug hunting/fixing by
Chris Li (who has the rather interesting email address
<chrisl@gnuchina.org>).  Chris is working on the Ext3 port as well.
Bill Irwin is providing loving care and attention to the hash function, so I 
feel it's in good hands.
Known Bug:
  - highmem doesn't work (because the kmapping code is wrong)
To Do:
  - Finalize hash function.
  - Coalesce on delete.  I have to do this sooner rather than later,
    since hash bucket fragmentation leads quickly to reduced leaf
    fullness.
  - Stable telldir cookie for NFS
  - Ext2 util updates (in progress, Ted Ts'o)
  - Miscellaneous source cleanups
Because of the unfinalized hash function, this patch is still for testing 
only.
