Well, just look up some mainstream architectures in MAINTAINERS. The
x86 architecture, for example, has three but the point here is that
you probably don't want to end up with ten individual maintainers (how
are you going to coordinate the work?) whereas more than one is
definitely okay.
If you have a lot of people maintaining your port, then just create a
mailing list and put that in MAINTAINERS with only few "top
maintainers" listed by their individual email to make life easy for
patch submitters.
