Hi Devesh
I believe you have basic kernel compilation problem :)
Your kernel cannot mount / because the boot loader was configured to find a 
root=LABEL=/
As this is a RedHat kernel extension, your self compiled 2.6.13 kernel cannot 
understand this.
You should change your lilo/grub config to match your root device as 
root=/dev/hda2  (if hda2 is your root device)
Also check that your kernel (or initrd) contains the disk driver you need.
Eric
