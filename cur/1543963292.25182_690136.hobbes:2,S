Not to mention the 102 setup.c, 87 irq.c, 62 time.c... It is very
common to have duplicated file names in the kernel tree because it
supports so many architectures and platforms. In general, when you work
on a given architecture or platform, names become unique again. Taking
GDB as an example again, you definitely know what architecture you are
debugging, so there should be relatively little ambiguity on what files
are involved.
(On top of that, I'd argue that we _should_ be able to display relative
paths to file names when debugging.)
Your point about the "single program namespace" is certainly valid for
small to medium-size programs, but in the case of something as big as
the kernel, it probably no longer holds.

I don't have a strong opinion on this either, it is very unlikely that
I'll ever have to deal with this file personally. I'm only telling you
what the common practice is in the kernel tree.
