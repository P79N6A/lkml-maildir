What's the big gain? Where's the harm in just building all the sound 
modules - you only load one in the end anyway, and the space taken by the 
other modules is negligible with the disk sizes of today I'd say (ok, 
there's some extra build time involved, but that shouldn't be a big deal 
either). Or just use good old "make menuconfig" to only enable the module 
you want. Besides, it's not as if you have to redo your kernel config from 
scratch every time you want a new kernel. Make your favorite config once, 
build and install that kernel and then when you want a newer kernel simply 
either cd linux-<version>; zcat /proc/config.gz > .config ; make oldconfig 
and then build the new kernel using your previous config.
