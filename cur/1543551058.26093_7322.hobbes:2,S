Although ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS is #defined, we may take this value as
a constant. I've never seen the cards with more than five logical
devices. I can add a comment that a change of the constant will
cause compatibility problems with modutils.
Another solution is to change ISAPNP_CARD_TABLE to:
#define ISAPNP_CARD_TABLE(name) \
		const int __module_isapnp_card_devs = ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS; \
                MODULE_GENERIC_TABLE(isapnp_card, name)
But, I think that we don't need this change at the time. If the situation
arises (we found an ISA PnP card with more than eight logical devices), we
may add a global variable to determine the structure change as well. The
change may be also determined with checking of the kernel version.

Moving of driver_data to top of the structure is a good idea.
I'll proceed.

I prefer this solution (everything on one line). I don't think that
this format will cause problems for simple parsers.
