The parport code only uses DMA when told by the user, so 
	insmod parport_pc dma=auto
should to the trick. Parport DMA transfers are considered experimental still,
so this is not the default.

Fine. With PNPBIOS or ACPI you don't currently need dma=auto.
This is subject to change probably (see above).
