Ingo is assuming a best-case scenario here. Assumptions are the mother of all 
fuckups. This discussion does not address issues which arise when:
- You compile code with different compilers (say, OCaml, tcc, Intel Compiler, 
or whatever)
- What happens when you run existing commercial applications which have not 
been compiled using GCC.
- What happens when you mix GCC compiled code with other code (e.g. a 
commercial Motif library).
- What happens when you link libraries compiled with older GCC versions?
- And so on and so forth.
It can be fun to dive into a low-level details discussion. But unless you 
solved the higher level issues, the whole discussion is just a waste of time. 
And these higher level issues won't be fixed unless people start to properly 
address worst-case behaviour, like any sensible engineer would do.

You've tried to educate these people before. You're wasting your time and 
talent. I think you should ask for a handsome payment when these people want 
to enjoy the privilege of being properly educated by someone who knows what 
he's talking about.
Groetjes,
Peter.
