There are rather a lot of of FIXME comments, including scary stuff like

 > +	 * dropping too low.  Needs more thought.
 > +	 */
 > +	atomic_inc(&old_dentry->d_inode->i_count);
and

 > +	 * have on the stack.  Possibly the best solution would be to bite
 > +	 * the bullet and do another format change before release and
 > +	 * shrink the inodes.
 > +	 */
 > +	struct logfs_disk_inode old, new;
are you going to change the format?  or fix this some other way?
I think a sweep through the code searching for FIXME and at least
rewriting all such comments to look like stuff that can be deferred
would be warranted ;)
