If the usages is too write-intensive, then RCU will certainly be less
likely to work well.  But there is nothing quite like actually trying
it to see how it works.  ;-)
That aside, it -is- possible to make such state changes appear atomic,
even when moving elements from one list to another.  One way of doing
this is to atomically replace the element with a "tombstone" element.
Normal pointer writes suffice.  The "tombstone" is set up so that searches
for the outgoing element will stall (e.g., spin or sleep, depending
on the environment).  The element is moved to its destination list.
At this point, searches for the element in the old list will still
stall, while searches for the element in the new list will succeed.
The tombstone is now marked so that CPUs stall on it now resume, but
indicating failure to find the element in the old list.
Of course, this approach makes writes more expensive than they otherwise
would be, so, again, RCU is best for read-intensive uses.  ;-)
The fact that this data structure is not very read-intensive is due
to the fact that short-lived TCP connections are quite common, right?
Or am I missing the finer points of this data structure's workings?
						Thanx, Paul
