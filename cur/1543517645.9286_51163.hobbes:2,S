hm, this shouldnt happen, because it's not current->need_resched that gets
set, but cpu_curr(cpu)->need_resched. cpu_curr gets set atomically and
takes the value of the next process already before doing the switch_to().  
So any new wakeup and potential ->need_resched setting should go to the
next process.
