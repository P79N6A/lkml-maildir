Yeah, there are a ton of interesting possibilities which I have probably not
done enough to publicize.

UML is approaching three years old (I started hacking in Feb 1998; 
the first public sign of it was the following June).

Yeah, one can hope :-)
I'm currently banging on bugs and residual missing functionality.  When I
think that's all done, that will be what I call UML V1.0 and I will send
it to Marcelo.  At that point, the out-of-tree phase of UML will be over.

Thanks, thanks, and thanks!
