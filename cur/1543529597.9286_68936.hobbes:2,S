Two problems.
1/ nfs doesn't see mount points unless you export both the parent and
the child filesystems, and flags the child filesystem as "nohide".
2/ knfsd won't export filesystems that don't live on a local disc - at
least, not yet.
You will have to use unfsd - the Universal Usermode NFS daemon to
re-export SMD filesystems.
