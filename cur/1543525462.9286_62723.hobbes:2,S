The following is a tcpdump reply received from an SMP box running
2.2.14:
<casp_> 18:16:49.797162 arp who-has 10.10.10.100 tell 10.10.10.166
<casp_> 18:16:49.797269 arp reply 10.10.10.100 is-at 0:40:f6:f4:ff:ef
<casp_> 18:16:49.797272 arp reply 10.10.10.100 is-at 0:40:f6:f4:ff:73
10.10.10.100 is the SMP box, which has two rtl8139 cards.  10.10.10.133
is assigned to the second net card.
(10.10.10.166 is a 2.2.5-22(RH) box which simply stopped communicating
with the network last night)
