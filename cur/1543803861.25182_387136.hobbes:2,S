Subject: [2.6 patch] sound/pci/cs46xx/dsp_spos_scb_lib.c: fix an assertion

D Binderman <dcb314@hotmail.com> reported the following in kernel 
Bugzilla #5903 [1]:
<--  snip  -->
I just tried to compile kernel 2.6.15.1 with the Intel C compiler. 
It said
sound/pci/cs46xx/dsp_spos_scb_lib.c(673): warning #187: use of "=" where 
"==" may have been intended
The source code is
           snd_assert (rate = 48000);
I agree with the compiler. Suggest new code
           snd_assert (rate == 48000);
<--  snip  -->
Thankfully this bug would only become visible if the assertion was 
false, but anyways it's a bug.
