This is why it doesn't work anymore, as it shouldn't have in the first
place.  Thanks for pointing this out.  I did not know that source
address selection is automatic, depending on the multicast address
prefix (ff05::/16, ff02::/16, etc) and the IPV6_MULTICAST_IF option, so
I instinctively did bind the socket to the unicast address and not the
multicast address.
Now it seems to work like a charm. =)
Thanks,
Ignacy
