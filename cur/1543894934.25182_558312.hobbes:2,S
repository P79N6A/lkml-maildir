Tracking regressions is not a real problem.
Especially since it doesn't require much technical knowledge.

I sent weekly regression reports.
Not automatically generated but manually - but that doesn't matter.
The problem is that sending reports itself does not fix anything.

_debugging_ (can be indirectly by poking other people to do debugging)

no, *debugging*
I tracked regressions for the 2.6.21 disaster, and the not debugged 
regressions that I had tracked are exactly where we should be better.

Different social problem.

As I expected, someone else has picked up regression tracking.
And other from what you claim, this did not require any kind of tool.

The problem for the Linux kernel is that for a better bug handling you'd 
need people willing to learn other people's code and to do the hard work 
of debugging bug reports. E.g. writing a new filesystem is simply much 
more fun than learning and debugging other people's code in some old 
filesystem.
Talking about "team maintenance" sounds nice, but the problem in the 
kernel starts with code that has zero maintainers. And if there's 
already a maintainer, it's unlikely that he'll not accept patches from 
some new person debugging bug reports. But how to find people who will 
become good maintainers?

Debian has it's own problems, Linux kernel development at least has a 
working structure for getting decisions and regular releases.

People aren't that dumb that some empty words like "release is a reward"
would change anything.

Bug tracking for the kernel is more or less working.
The main problem is getting people to debug bug reports.
We need the main problem fixed, not a different tool in an area that is 
not the main problem.
