And apparently you didn't file a bug because I just looked in the bug
database.  Was typing "bk sendbug" too difficult?

There are *lots* of things in BK that aren't as good as they could be.
If you want them better, you need to complain about them.

PGP didn't have a business model, we do, and part of our business model
is to give it away to some of the world.  It's a good business model,
BK is dramatically better because the PPC team used it and Cort went
through all sorts of stuff as BK improved.  BK would easily be a year
back in terms of usefulness if it weren't for Cort and there is no way
he would have been using it if we charged for it.  We get something by
letting people use it for free.  It's part of our business model and
it works.
