With a relatively small patch, I was able to make NFS bind to a particular
local IP (poor man's namespace with existing code).  I also changed it so
that multiple mounts to the same destination (and with unique local mount
points) are treated as unique mounts.  This patch was done so that I could
stress test NFS servers, but similar logic might work for namespace isolation
as well...
