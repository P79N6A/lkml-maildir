Well the stall effects the SCSI generic driver (st and
ioctls issued from the SCSI subsystem). So one problem
is the static storage class of that function (which is in
drivers/block). It is not exported either as Jens pointed
out. Also when the SCSI mid level queuing code comes
to this point, it already has io_request_lock.
Anyway one strategy for char drivers putting things on
those queues is to set q->plugged to zero and dispatch. 
Actually, Jens is now proposing that the 
scsi_lib::scsi_request_fn() doesn't check for "plugged" 
at all. That solves my problem and saves code.
My tests show that the same "plugged" stall delays the
lilo command sometimes as well.
