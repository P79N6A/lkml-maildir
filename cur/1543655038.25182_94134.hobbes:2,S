Unfortunately it doesn't. Currently those legacy, PnP, EISA devices all have
virtual parents, which has nothing to do with reality. Modern systems
(including most PCs) hang these buses off PCI bus using PCI-to-{E}ISA
bridge. Such systems must be able to register these buses upon
discovery of the ISA bridges (from pci layer), and use them as a
parent device for legacy/isa/pnp stuff. This will be absolutely required
if DMA operations are moved from pci_dev to the generic device.

The `sysdata' arg already contains info about parent host-to-pci controller
on many platforms. I don't think that we need to duplicate it with
another one.
I was thinking about something like this instead of `sysdata':
struct io_controller {		/* Level 0 I/O controller */
	... arch specific fields ...;
	... generic fields ...;	/* like `index' */
	struct device dev;
}
