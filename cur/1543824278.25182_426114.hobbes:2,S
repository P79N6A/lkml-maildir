OK, it is enough, to switch to 64bit, thanks!
But i have a little problem.
My node #3 reboots again.
At this point i have run out of ideas. :-(
This is checked already:
- the complete hardware, except the 12 hdd. (smart reports, no errors at
all, 4x ide + 8xSATA all 300GB.)
- the SMP race. (checked with non-smp kernel)
- APIC/ACPI (tested with non...  kernel)
- the e1000 driver (tested with realtek gige adapter)
- the complete filesystem, OS (NFS-ROOT, and copy between nodes.)
- the memory allocation proble, (checked with debug-kernel, and rised
min_free_kbytes)
The systems only service is nbd. (nbd-server serving md0, raid4 array)
Anybody have an idea?
Please let me know!
Thanks,
Janos
