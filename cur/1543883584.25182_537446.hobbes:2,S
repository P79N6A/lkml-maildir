The state should be TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. That's the state of the thread
'p' should be in when we do a kthread_bind(p) in _cpu_down().
Are you sure about the TASK_RUNNING part ?

Ok, it should not be that worrisome!
By the time we would be doing kthread_stop(p) in _cpu_down(), 'p' would have
been moved over to some other online cpu, due to the migrate_dead_tasks() 
called in CPU_DEAD handling of migration_call (kernel/sched.c).
So we are safe. Anyway, I apologise for causing any worry :-)
