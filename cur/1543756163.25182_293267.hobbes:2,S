Red herring.
2.4.x has ICH5/6 support -- but is missing the RAID support component.
We are talking about hardware that is ALREADY supported by 2.4.x kernel, 
not new hardware.
We are also talking about inability to access data on hardware supported 
by 2.4.x, not something that can easily be ignored or papered over with 
a compatibility mode.
