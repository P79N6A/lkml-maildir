Subject: [RFC] Orphaning MMC host drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've reached the point where I've grown tired of trying to figure out who has
hardware for what. I intend to commit the following in a few days so if you care
about the quality of the drivers it's time to step up to the plate.
There's a rather long list of cc here, but I've included everyone that has been
involved in the drivers in one way or another in case one or two maintainers can
actually be found.
Even if you don't feel like maintaining this, feel free to suggest mailing lists
that should be added to the entries.

    mmc: mark unmaintained drivers
    Most of the host controller drivers in the MMC layer lacks an
    official maintainer. Make sure this is mentioned in MAINTAINERS
    in case someone wants to pick up the ball.
