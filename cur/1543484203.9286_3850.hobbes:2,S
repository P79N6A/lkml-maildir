8 MB of course. :-)
Linux used to run on a 2 MB 386 with 4 kB pages. That would be
512 total pages
 96 for the ISA hole
 ?? for the kernel itself
Maybe there were 350 pages. If you scale the page size up with the
new memory size and address space, you get close to 8 MB for a page.
The normal 4 kB pages could be used at the same time, but the huge
memory system is easier to explain if you forget about them.
You don't need 16 million puny little pages.
