Great. It's been like this for *months* with suspend2.

Sure, if I find time I will.

As I said before - it's going to be years. Never mind that all this
stuff exists in suspend2 now.

Again - stuff is there, but for some weird reason it's not good enough.
Instead of using what's there and works reliably while developing the
next big thing, we'll be back where we were - no decent suspend/resume
support for a while. Excellent.
Whatever happened to release early, release often?

Here is the thing - I don't have to do this with suspend2. Why is it
that suspend2 code overcomes the obstacles that swsusp can't? This is
rhetorical, of course.
Anyhow, if I find time, I will.
