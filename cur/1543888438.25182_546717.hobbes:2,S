The best solution would be to give kconfig full knowledge of all
Kconfig files. Then the "undefined symbol" is no longer a warning
but an error.
That would require a bit of kconfig surgery that we should do one day.
But giving kconfig full knowledge would gain a lot in several scenarios.
Turning the undefined symbol to an error is just one part of it.
