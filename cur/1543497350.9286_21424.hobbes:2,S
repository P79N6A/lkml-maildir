Let me get this straight...
Buffered is when a program writes to a file and
it is buffered.
Cached is for when a program reads from a file.
Is that right?
Also, if one process has a file mmap()ed and another
process is writing to it, is the other process directly
writing to the same pages? Or are they kept in sync
some other way?
Basically, when you mmap() a file, are the actual pages
in the buffer cache be mapped into your address space?
Please CC any replies to me.
