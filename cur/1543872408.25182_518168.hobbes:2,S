Thats good.

And that's bad. When you say "it stinks" is it more than 3 times slower? It 
should be precisely 3 times slower under that load (although low cpu using 
things like audio wont be affected by running 3 times slower). If it feels 
like much more than that much slower, there is a bug there somewhere. As 
another reader suggested, how does it run with the compile 'niced'? How does 
it perform with make (without a -j number).

What HZ are you running? Are you running a Beryl desktop?
