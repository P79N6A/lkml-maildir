I've added a small patch to the -ck patchset to make it up to ck11
The Hz is set to 1000 (from RML's patch)
I've added my own patch which varies the timeslice duration. It is 
autoregulated by decreasing the duration according to the number of running 
processes or in the presence of uninterruptible processes. The range of 
timeslices is now huge depending on demand.
The diff against ck10 (a small patch) is available here:

Cheers,
Con
P.S. A brief summary of my patch is here :
(from sched.c)
MIN_TIMESLICE 		( 1 * timeslice_multiplier )
MAX_TIMESLICE		( 30 * timeslice_multiplier )
(from timer.c)
timeslice_multiplier autoregulated according to number of running tasks.  
Starts at 32 and is divided by nr_running()^2. Will drop to 1 if there are 
any nr_uninterruptible(). SMP is decreased proportionately less 
(1/smp_num_cpus).
