My code does blink NumLock on my box (Dell) so I wonder why it does not
on your box...
Anyway, as far as the patch goes - I don't think we want to do it this
way for a couple of reasons:
1. It does not reflect the true device hierarchy - LEDs are not children
of input devices, they are children of whatever device that owns input
device. So in case of AT keyboard LEDs should grow from corresponding
serio port, not input device and so atkbd should register all of its leds.
2. LEDs will stop working if input device is grabbed via EVIOCSGRAB.
I think that grab should not cross subsystem boundaries.
