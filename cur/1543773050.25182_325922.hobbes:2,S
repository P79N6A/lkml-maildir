IIRC specs of old AT PIC say that if input interrupt pins
are no longer asserted by the time when CPU asserts IRQ and tries
to read IRQ# from PIC, PIC returns 7. Thus you get IRQ7 or IRQ15
depending on where that happened, on primary or secondary PIC.
Presumably there can be 'bad' devices which momentarily flash
their IRQ, confusing PIC.
However, I am a bit surprized how often these IRQ7s happen.
Maybe APIC's PIC emulation just reuses this convention to
indicate APIC errors in PIC emulation mode. I am not familiar
with APIC, tho... I did not yet read APIC docs.
