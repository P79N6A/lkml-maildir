The hard way is to make your device mmap()-able and lock (& make present) 
the pages whenever you start IO, and save the (address)->(page_struct *) 
for the IRQ handler. The IRQ handler is free to access a page-cache page
that is locked. The easier way (if your semantics allow this) is to shape
your device as a block-device. The hacky way is to ioremap() it and make
it's pages visible to user-space (ie. everybody in the system), this is a
security hole but might be the easiest solution for special isolated
appliances.
