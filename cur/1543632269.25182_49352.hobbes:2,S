I could be wrong but I think Linus wants small patches that slowly
convert kbuild24 to kbuild25, and not just a chopped up wholesale
kbuild25.
There's a big difference between splitting kb25 into pieces and figuring
out a way to migrate from kb24 to kb25 with small patches.  You're
suggesting the former while Linus wants the latter.
