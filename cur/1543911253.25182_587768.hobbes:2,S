Yes.

In this case, I'm referring to the patch which had a typo, which is yours:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=7632fc8f809a97f9d82ce125e8e3e579390ce2e5
Description follows:
"During a static link, ld has started putting a .note section in the
.uml.setup.init section.  This has the result that the UML setups begin
with 32 bytes of garbage and UML crashes immediately on boot.
This patch creates a specific .note section for ld to drop this stuff
into."
My patch only made your change work for real - IIRC you had fixed that exact 
typo too, but you forgot to run quilt refresh before sending the patch (btw, 
quilt pop -a will force you to refresh all patches to succeed - I do it 
frequently).

In this case, we _may_ want to remove the .note section altogether - even if 
it is likely to shake out more problems.
Good bye!
