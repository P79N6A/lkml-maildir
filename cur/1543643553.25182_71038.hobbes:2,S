On a semi related note, vmstat wants to know the number of running,
blocked and swapped processes. strace vmstat one day and you will see it
currently opens /proc/*/stat (ie one open for each process) just to get
these stats.  Yet another place where the monitoring utilities disturb
the system way too much.
Can we get some things in /proc/stat to give us these numbers? Does
"swapped" make any sense on Linux?
