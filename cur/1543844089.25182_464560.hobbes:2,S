I can't even find a reference to SIOCGSTAMP in the
dhcp-2.0pl5 or dhcp3-3.0.3 sources shipped in Ubuntu.
But I will note that tpacket_rcv() expects to always get
valid timestamps in the SKB, it does a:
	if (skb->tstamp.off_sec == 0) { 
		__net_timestamp(skb);
		sock_enable_timestamp(sk);
	}
so that it can fill in the h->tp_sec and h->tp_usec
fields.
