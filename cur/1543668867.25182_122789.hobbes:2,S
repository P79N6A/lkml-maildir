A grep in drivers/media/*.c finds 44 files that contain I2C or i2c.
At least one of them is only a comment.
And drivers/media/video/Kconfig does include I2C as a dependency in
some cases.
The I2C subsystem seems to be in a great state of flux right now also.
I expect that the statement in drivers/i2c/Kconfig is a bit strong;
I don't think that I2C is needed for _all_ V4L support, just some of them.
