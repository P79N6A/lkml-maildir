If you have a screensaver set to run after x minutes of inactivity, yes.
From its perspective, when you set the date that way, it sees a whole day
of inactivity and so it activates the screensaver.  Since you probably
kept typing or moving the mouse, the screensaver would then have shut off
right away.  Substitute "screensaver and/or powersave mode" as appropriate.
