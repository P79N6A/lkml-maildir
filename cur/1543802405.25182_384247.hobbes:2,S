It turned out that a BIOS upgrade fixed the problem, but this doesn't 
answer your question.
The problem wasn't an incomplete emulation of the i8042, because when the
USB handoff code was commented out the PS/2 keyboard worked okay.  This
means the handoff, when enabled, wasn't being done correctly.  That could
be the fault of the USB drivers or the BIOS (or both).  We have no way to
tell which, because the users have all switched to the newer BIOS.
