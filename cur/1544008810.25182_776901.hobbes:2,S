That the grouse against the placement of
switch_to_thread_hw_breakpoint() is about additional code in the
hot-path, can we deal with this separately through a different patch?
I now have the patchset which provides only data breakpoint facility on
x86 (and x86_64) and has addressed your comments, ported against
2.6.28-rc7 which will be sent shortly. I'm thinking if the suggested
changes to the context-switching code can be handled later.
Thanks,
