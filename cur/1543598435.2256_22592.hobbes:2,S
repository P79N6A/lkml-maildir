It does not matter. It just tells you that you're dropping pages too
early. That is even more valid for streaming IO.
I understand that having readahead pages to apply too much pressure
on really used pages is bad.
However, considering readaheaded pages as a "special case" (and drop them
previously, or whatever) will _always_ potentially fuckup streaming IO (so
yes, I think the old drop behind code is bad too).

No. It will not help: the call to read_swap_cache_async() is before the
SetPageReferenced call.
