Because cache coherence is both complex and expensive and treating a NUMA
as a tight cluster rather than a single machine (as you mention) is
probably a saner architecture.
CC is primarily a big deal for user space, for apps pretending they're on
SMP. We don't want to encourage this model as it's fundamentally a bad
match for the hardware.
As for the kernel, supporting the two models should be relatively easy
compared to something like adding SMP support in the first place..  We are
already paying close attention to memory-sharing assumptions for
performance reasons and the number of inter-processor primitives is small.

I think this even makes sense on machines with CC hardware. The break-even
number of processors might be larger, but it's smaller than a medium-sized
NUMA machine.
