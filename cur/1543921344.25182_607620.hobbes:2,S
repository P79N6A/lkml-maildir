It's not totally useless not. It guarantees that by the time your
are out of your suspend(), a simultaneous instance of the IRQ handler
is either finished, or it (or any subsequent occurence) have seen
your insuspend flag set to 1.

The above doesn't handle the case where the IRQ handle just passed the
if (insuspend) test. You may end up calling pci_set_power_state() while
in the middle of some further HW accesses in the handler.
You still need synchronize_irq() for that reason. Or use a spinlock.

Not quite :-)
Also not that the work we are doing with synchronize_irq, if it gets
merged, renders it unnecessary for you to add those two memory barriers,
synchronize_irq will pretty much do the ordering for you.
