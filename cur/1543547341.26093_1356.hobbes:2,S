I support this request. It was promised since 2.2.13 to finally get a
working NFSv3 in the official kernel tree but it was always pushed
back further by "more important things" like driver updates and VM
changes...
I know that it is futile but getting LFS and RAID 0.90 would be nice,
too.  Especially as 95+% of all Linux users (which use a distribution
kernel) already _have_ 0.90 RAID and the last 5-% are able to patch
the old driver theirselves.
At least as a config option? CONFIG_NEW_RAID vs. CONFIG_OLD_RAID? Alan, if
you accept such a patch, I would generate one vs. 2.2.18pre1
