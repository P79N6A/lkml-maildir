surely aoe is better than iscsi almost on performance because of the lesser 
protocol stack:
iscsi ->  scsi - ip - eth
aoe -> ata - eth
but surely iscsi is more a standard than aoe and is more actively used by 
real-world .
Other really useful feature are that:
- iscsi is capable to move to a ip based san scsi devices by routing that ( 
i've some tape changer routed by scst to some system that don't have other 
way to see a tape).
- because it work on the ip layer it can be routed between long distance , so 
having needed bandwidth you can have a really remote block device spoking a 
standard protocol between non ethereogenus systems.
- iscsi is now the cheapest san avaible.
