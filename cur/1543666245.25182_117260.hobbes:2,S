When you are dealing with someone apparently being a corporate bully you
have no choice quite often but to publicize stuff. Whether Larry is
actually unreasonable is kind of hard to tell without all the context.
If Larry feels bitbucket is a lot like bitkeeper then I see his point.
If he's moaning about things like "foobar is  a tool for reading 
BitKeeper repositories" then I guess he forgot to take his pills this

Unfortunately all the current bad feeling and suspicion keeps 
magnifying probably minor misunderstandings into large ones
