There is a way to fulfill both needs. If my systems are part of that 0.1%,
I have to disagree with you. :)
There is no way to make one good VM for all possible situations. But, you
can tune/make one VM to work great on large DBMS (e.g.) and tune/make
another one to work great on ordinary desktop systems (playing mp3s & co).
So, add different VMs as kernel-config options. The 'default' one should
be VM for 99.9% users. Everybody happy? :)
