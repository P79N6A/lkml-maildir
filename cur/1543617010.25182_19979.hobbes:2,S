You may have noticed the great deal of "hacks" which people have put into
the kernel over the years to get it to work with the imperfect world of
hardware. It makes you wonder wether we should waste our time supporting
broken hardware... Then again if we didn't we'd only run on 0.1% of the
boxes out there ;) But... i'm in no way advocating for adding more
kludges.
