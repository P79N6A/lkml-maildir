Sooner or later that will run out too, and then you are where you started.

They are a way of killing processes without declaring OOM (OOM effect
without OOM :). If they are set up to not overcommit, ever. Rarely done, as
it is a huge waste. Start over.

Very much agree. It would be nice if we were given the alternative, which
we aren't right now. First question is, who is going to use this? How
extensively? For what kinds of uses? Next question is, how much does this
cost, when it is used and when it isn't? How much developer/maintainer/
tester manpower it consumes has to be counted in here. Both in the kernel
configuration case "Overcommit memory (Y|n)", in the case where it is
runtime tunable "Allow tuning memory overcommit at runtime (Y|n)", and a
fixed alternative.
