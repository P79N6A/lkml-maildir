In fact, during design phase we've considered to use kobject_uevent() as
well but (if i recall correctly), it didn't fit for the simple reason
that if we want to have that much code in user-space, than we need to
have more control on netlink socket and need to pass binary data back
and forth.
It would be nice to set MAX_LINKS to 64 and close this issue for now,
since I'm pretty sure some other apps might find out kobject_uevent()
not suitable for their needs too.
