It seems like it's caused by the driver trying to 
do things while it's still setting up the rings.
static void ace_rx_int(struct net_device *dev, u32 rxretprd, u32 rxretcsm)
{
	...
        rip = &ap->skb->rx_jumbo_skbuff[skbidx];
	...
	skb = rip->skb;
	skb_put(skb, retdesc->size); /* crash here */
	...
}
while the driver might be doing this at the same time:
	for (i = 0; i < RX_JUMBO_RING_ENTRIES; i++) { 
      	 	if (ap->skb->rx_jumbo_skbuff[i].skb) {
	    	 	ap->rx_jumbo_ring[i].size = 0;
			set_aceaddr(&ap->rx_jumbo_ring[i].addr,
			dev_kfree_skb(ap->skb->rx_jumbo_skbuff[i].skb); 
	 	 	ap->skb->rx_jumbo_skbuff[i].skb = NULL;
              	}
         }
