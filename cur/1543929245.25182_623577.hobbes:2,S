Throwing frequent debugging messages for non buggy cases will
just lead to people generally ignore softlockups.
I don't think runtime instrumentation is the way to introduce
TASK_KILLABLE in general. The only way there is people going through
the source and identify places where it makes sense.

Actually task delay accounting can measure this now.  iirc someone
had a latencytop based on it already.

This means the user has to see their kernel log fill by such
messages at least once - do a round trip to some mailing list to 
explain that it is expected and not a kernel bug - then tweak
some obscure parameters. Doesn't seem like a particular fruitful
procedure to me.

It's about robustness, not the typical case.
Throwing backtraces when something slightly unusual happens is not a robust system.
