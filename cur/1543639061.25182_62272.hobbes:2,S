Can you explain this further. How else do you propose to get rid of 
unmaintained-and-absolutely-hopeless-on-64bit drivers in the configuration? 
I definitely do not want to get bug reports about these not working on x86-64.
If you think CONFIG_X86_64 is too ugly, perhaps an generic CONFIG_64BIT would 
be preferable for you? I personally would prefer CONFIG_UNMAINTAINED_AND_BROKEN and telling users they are on their own when they enable it, but that is 
probably just me.

Given that one was bogus. Must have been a merge mistake on my part.
