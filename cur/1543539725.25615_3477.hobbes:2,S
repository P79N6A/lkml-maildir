	cramfs was calling bforget() on every block that it read.
bforget() has a side effect of causing the corresponding block of a
ramdisk to be filled with zeroes.
	At first, I thought the correct fix was to change bforget to
just do a brelse if a page was marked with BH_Protected.  However, on
closer inspection, it appears that everywhere else in the kernel
where bforget is called, it really is OK to wipe out the underlying
data (basically, deleted blocks).  This is actually quite useful
for, say, a writable ext2 filesystem on a ramdisk device.  So, I believe
the correct fix is for cramfs to call brelse instead of bforget.
	I have attached the patch below.
