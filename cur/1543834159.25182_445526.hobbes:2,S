Someone showed code like
  _Bool foo = 42;
and if we were to make the compiler warn about it that would mean we are
basically trying to change/manipulate the standard (I'm guessing). It's
probably not in the standard because it's such a moot point. However if we
were to use
  if(foo)
  {
    ...
  }
we'd see it was true. That's because 
  FALSE == 0
and
  TRUE == !FALSE (i.e. any value that isn't 0)
from the compiler's standpoint. Function that return 'true' for an integer
type (as opposed to a C++ standard-type bool) should be tested like
  if(SomeFunction())
or
  if(!SomeFunction())
instead of testing for equality
  if(SomeFunction() == TRUE)
of
  if(SomeFunction() == FALSE)
as the former (IMO) is as readable, if not more readable as the latter, and
it's likely to get optimised better. That and someone might give true AND
return a status by returning neither 0 or 1, in which case 
  if(... == TRUE)
would fail, as TRUE == 1.
And just as a note, you really should read the documentation (at least once)
for any function you use, and therefore know if it returns {FALSE, TRUE, ...
, TRUE} or {OK, ERR1, ERR2, ..., ERRn}

Meh, it's all the same. I don't think 3 wasted CPU cycles is going to worry
anyone too much. Hell, sometimes int IS long, though I might be wrong there.
P.S. First post! Hello everybody.
