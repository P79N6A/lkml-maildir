It would be interesting to know which assertion failed. I
guess it might be a zone alignment problem -- it would be
interesting to turn the 2 HOLES_IN_ZONE tests into BUG_ONs,
and enable them (ie. move them out of HOLES_IN_ZONE).
It might be an idea to unconditionally enable DEBUG_VM in
prereleases, too.
Thanks,
Nick
