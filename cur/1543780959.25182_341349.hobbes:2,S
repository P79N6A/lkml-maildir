You deduce this by the absence of SecO and PriO?  I wonder if lspci
should be enhanced to notice this, too.  I assume that the IRQ 169
doesn't correspond to anything in /proc/interrupts.
So the scenario in question (correct me if I'm wrong) is that we
have a PCI IDE device that is handed off in compatibility mode (and
may only work in that mode).  In that case, the PCI *device* still
exists, so shouldn't the IDE PCI code claim that device, notice that
it's in compatibility mode, and use the legacy ports and IRQs if
necessary?
It seems like that all should work even if we don't have IDE_GENERIC.
