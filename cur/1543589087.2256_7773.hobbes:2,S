It's a little more painful than you'd think for the simple reason that
ramfs currently contains no space accounting whatsoever, which
probably is a bad thing.  It definitely gave me some serious pause
when I was working on SuperRescue 1.3, since I had no way of
reasonably judging how big my ramfs actually was.  The only way I
could get a reasonable idea was rebooting with various mem=
parameters.
