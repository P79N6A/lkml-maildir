Sorry, a small fix is needed for this patch.  Namely, dpm_sysfs_remove(dev)
should not be called by device_pm_schedule_removal(), because it will be called
anyway from device_pm_remove() when the device object is finally unregistered
(we're talking here about unlikely error paths only, but still).
Corrected patch follows.
Thanks,
Rafael

It sometimes is necessary to destroy a device object during a suspend or
hibernation, but the PM core is supposed to control all device objects in that
cases.  For this reason, it is necessary to introduce a mechanism allowing one
to ask the PM core to remove a device object corresponding to a suspended
device on one's behalf.
Define function destroy_suspended_device() that will schedule the removal of
a device object corresponding to a suspended device by the PM core during the
subsequent resume.
