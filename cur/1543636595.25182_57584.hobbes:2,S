GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT - The  government announced  today that  it is
changing its mascot  to a condom because  it more clearly reflects the
government's political stance.  A condom stands up to inflation, halts
production, destroys  the next generation,  protects a bunch of pricks
and finally, gives you a sense of security while you're being screwed!
