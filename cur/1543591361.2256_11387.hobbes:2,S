I have both. I also have `flex`, but not `lex'. `lex' is a simlink to
flex. What this compile wanted is some header files in expects for
`yacc` that are not present. And they don't come with the `bison`
distribution. Maybe they came with `yacc` years ago? Anyway there
are some poor assumptions being made in the source Makefile.
It would be nice to have the 'microcode' assembler running for
aic7xxx since it is now required for the thing to load.
