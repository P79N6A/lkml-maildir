It may also be faster since the processors can have exclusive cache lines.
This means we need to move rss into the task struct. But how does one get
from mm struct to task struct? current is likely available most of
the time. Is that always the case?

Note though that the mmap_sem is no protection. It is a read lock and may
be held by multiple processes while incrementing and decrementing rss.
This is likely reducing the number of collisions significantly but it wont
be a  guarantee like locking or atomic ops.
