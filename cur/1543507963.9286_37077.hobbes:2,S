That was my instincts as well...

Note that this is NOT a separate card, but circuitry on the
motherboard itself, and the only visible external connector is
certainly a BNC one.

Precicely my thoughts...

Unfortunately, it doesn't work as an NE2k - I tried it when I picked
it up, with a 2.0.29 network kitchen sink (a floppy with a kernel with
all of the available network drivers hard compiled in), and none of
the drivers therein managed to autoprobe it successfully.
I'm planning on building a 2.2.X network kitchen sink and trying that
out to see what comes up, but that will be a while yet...
Best wishes from Riley.
