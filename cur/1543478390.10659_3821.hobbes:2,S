Sorry but your are, dear compatriot, missing one point: 
the downloading off a crypto engine is assimilated to its use, so it
is also illegal to download it. It means that, theorically nobody in 
France will get the kernel with des inside. I know that it wont brake 
individual users, but companies will expose themselves to trials if 
they download DES kernel to create special no-crypto distrib, so it 
has to be done outside France.
But once again I can't see why not have inside kernel something like
void des_encrypt(....)
{ return; }
And another patch, do replace this dummy des_encrypt()

Not POLITIC, but a question of good sence and France interior 
security !!! POLITIC has nothing to do with that. 
For people who think that French government wants to spy on French 
people, dont forget that 3DES is authorised (under conditions) inside 
France
