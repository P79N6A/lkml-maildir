If you revert all three patches in this thread, you should be okay. If
you're having trouble with that, you can revert all the way back to
the version in 2.6.21 (by just copying it), and then do a
search/replace on loop.c to change any invalidate_bdev(bdev, 0) you
find to invalidate_bdev(bdev) and that should work as well.
