The following symbols should be allowed to be set to 'm' but are not:
	CONFIG_USB
	CONFIG_UHCI
	CONFIG_UHCI_ALT
If CONFIG_USB_SERIAL is set to 'y' CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_DEBUG should be
allowed to be chosen.  I do not see this happening.
And why is the CONFIG_USB_SERIAL options in the drivers/usb directory?
In the CML1 version they live in their own subdirectory quite nicely :)
Either way they should be in the USB port drivers section, not the "USB
devices" section of the menu.
There doesn't seem to be any rules set up for drivers/hotplug.
thanks,
