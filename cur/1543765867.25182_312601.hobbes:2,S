Sorry, I may mistake the point,

What I want to say is takeover may makes memory unstable, because there
are extra operations to reserve current (unstable) status to memory.
Live patching never force target process to reserve status to memory. Is
this make sense?

I think the point is how long does it takes to hand the fd off to
another process.(means how long time the network port is unavailable??)

Please see and try 
http://pannus.sourceforge.net
There includes commands and some samples.
On live patching, you never need to use shared memory, just prepare
fixed code, and just compile it as shared ibject, that's all. pretty
easy and fast to replace the functions.
