"bind" does not tell the driver core to "bind this device with this
driver", it tells it to "bind this driver to whatever devices we match
that aren't already bound".
That doesn't solve my use case.

It's still not a correct solution. If we want a specific driver to be
bound to a specific device, userspace shouldn't have to jump through
hoops to do it. It should be simple and clean.
The suggestions you are giving require userspace to work around a
deficiency in the kernel, by guessing the ordering requirements to
satisfy what the user wants. In cases of hotplugging, it is also
sometimes impossible to satisfy these requirements using the current
scheme.
