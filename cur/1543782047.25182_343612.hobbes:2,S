There appears to be a missing spin_unlock in tcp_v4_get_port.
                 do {    rover++;
                         if (rover > high)
                                 rover = low;
                         head = &tcp_bhash[tcp_bhashfn(rover)];
                         spin_lock(&head->lock);
head->lock is acquired.
                         tb_for_each(tb, node, &head->chain)
                                 if (tb->port == rover)
                                         goto next;
we don't find what we want.  break out of while loop.
                         break;
                 next:
                         spin_unlock(&head->lock);
                 } while (--remaining > 0);
                 tcp_port_rover = rover;
                 spin_unlock(&tcp_portalloc_lock);
                 /* Exhausted local port range during search? */
                 ret = 1;
                 if (remaining <= 0)
                         goto fail;
here we go to fail; head->lock is still acquired.
....
fail_unlock:
         spin_unlock(&head->lock);
fail:
         local_bh_enable();
         return ret;
Is this a real bug?  The same code was also copy-pasted into 
tcp_v6_get_port.
