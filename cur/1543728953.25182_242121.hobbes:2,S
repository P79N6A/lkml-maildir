The basic idea is to mark FW_LOADER as automatically selected and ATMEL 
would simply depend on it and as soon as ATMEL is selected FW_LOADER is 
selected. It'll work similiar to select, but it will respect dependencies 
(since it uses normal depencencies), it will also be easier to force 
deselection of FW_LOADER by (temporarily) disabling autoselect for it.
bye, Roman
