actually, that's not the problem here because the canary is in the
local variable area, it doesn't affect the passed arguments. what
happens here is that gcc treats the argument area as owned by the
callee, not the caller and is allowed to do certain tricks. for ssp
it will make a copy of the struct passed by value into the local
variable area and pass *its* address down, and it won't copy it back
into the original instance stored in the argument area.
so once sys_execve returns, the pt_regs passed by value hasn't at all
changed and its default content will cause a nice double fault (FWIW,
this part took me the longest to debug, being down with cold didn't
help it either ;).

the best practical defense against leaking the canary is to change its
value on every syscall but it has some performance impact in microbenchmarks.

this should probably be implemented in a general get_random_long()
function...

the config comment says -fstack-protector whereas you're really enabling
the stonger -fstack-protector-all feature (without the latter the ssp
test function sample_stackprotector_fn wouldn't even be instrumented ;-).
