Which is an idea that I toyed with, as well.  The problem that I ran into
is how to tag an allocation as belonging to a specific subsystem.  For
example, in our code we need networking to use the critical pool.  How do
we let __alloc_pages() know what allocations belong to networking?
Networking needs named slab allocations, kmalloc allocations, and whole
page allocations to function.  Should each subsystem get it's own GFP flag
(GFP_NETWORKING, GFP_SCSI, GFP_SOUND, GFP_TERMINAL, ad nauseum)?  Should we
create these pools dynamically and pass a reference to which pool each
specific allocation uses (thus adding a parameter to all memory allocation
functions in the kernel)?  I realize that per-subsystem pools would be
better, but I thought about this for a while and couldn't come up with a
reasonable way to do it.

Well, it can for our use, but I recognize that isn't going to be a huge
selling point! :)  As I mentioned in my reply to Pavel, I'd really like to
find a way to design something that WOULD be generally useful.
Thanks!
