If I had such an SCSI problem, I would probably track it this way:
1) - Use a setup with all features enabled: 80MB/s, disconnections, tagged
     commmads, etc ...
   - Only connect the most trustable SCSI device to the SCSI BUS.
     Undubitably it is the SEAGATE hard drive. Connect it using the Ultra2 
     cable with the LVD/SE terminator at its end.
   - Remove all other SCSI cables.
   - Boot the system.
   - Stress the system using heavy IO load.
If the system is not stable, then the device configuration that has the
problem is now a lot simpler than the initial one. 
Let us assume that the system is stable. :)
I now would add to the SCSI BUS a second device and then stress again 
the system using heavy IOs on the both devices, and so on ...
With such a strategy, you will be able to determine some simplest
combination of devices/cables that fails with the SCSI set-up you intend
to use with your system and the results may give some clue.
BTW, never leave part of the BUS (some end of a cable connected to the
BUS) without a terminator at its end.
The simpler the system that fails the easier it is to find the cause 
of the problem.
There is 5 configurations to investigate and with some good guessing 2 or
3 should be enough :), and you can for example continue testing this way: 
Example (hypothesis)
- The SEAGATE is ok when it is alone on the BUS.
- The system fails with the SEAGATE + MICROPolis
At this step, I will try different driver set-ups.
Let me imagine that the system always fails using those set-ups. :)
Then, the next thing I will try is to connect only the MICROPolis on the
(a) SCSI BUS and stress the SCSI BUS with heavy IO load.
Having 2 SCSI BUS (controllers) obviously help.
Etc...

   Gérard.

If it is passive, then it is not conformant to SPI-2 (scsi-3).

No need to think here. Remove the JAZ from the SCSI BUS and whether your 
system fails or not under heavy IO load, you can just make sure.

Yes, do it.

Nothing syspicious. But I would suggest you to use a normal driver set-up, 
if narrowing the features seem not to help.

With your set-up, the driver suspends command processing for 10 seconds. 
This may perhaps confuse timeouts processing of the SCSI layer if a
command times out within this delay or may trigger some new bug. 2 seconds
is enough. Most O/Ses donnot use more than 3 seconds of such a delay after
a SCSI reset.
