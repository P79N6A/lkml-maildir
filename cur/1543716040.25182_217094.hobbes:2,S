The client/server thing is a bit misleading, what matters is the
direction of the transfer.  In the case I saw this morning, the G5 was
the sender.  In any case I was using the -W switch, which tells it not
to use the rsync algorithm but just transfer the whole file.  So I
believe that rsync on the G5 side was just reading the file through
once.
I have also noticed similar behaviour after doing a bk pull on a
kernel tree.
The really strange thing is that the behaviour seems to get worse the
more RAM you have.  I haven't noticed any problem at all on my laptop
with 768MB, only on the G5, which has 2.5GB.  (The laptop is still on
2.6.2-rc3 though, so I will try a newer kernel on it.)
Regards,
Paul.
