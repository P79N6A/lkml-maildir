There are lots of cases we don't care about speed - things like setup of
the controller, changing UDMA mode etc.

Or you have a small set of such functions for the critical paths - ie doing
actual block I/O which pass the set of values required to do that operation
and do the stores. What are the performance critical paths
	Begin a disk write
	Begin a disk read
	PIO transfer in
	PIO transfer out
	End a disk I/O fastpaths (no error case)
	Maybe ATAPI command writes ?
beyond that I doubt the rest are critical
