Hi!:
I have tried several times to compile the 2.2.0 kernel with my SuSe 6.0 Linux
distribution. It all works fine until I try to do a make zImage and then I get
the following error message:
jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686   -c -o checksum.o checksum.c
checksum.c:200: redefinition of `csum_partial_copy'
checksum.c:105: `csum_partial_copy' previously defined here
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:188: Fatal error: Symbol csum_partial_copy already defined.
make[2]: *** [checksum.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.0.36.SuSE/arch/i386/lib'
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.0.36.SuSE/arch/i386/lib'
make: *** [_dir_arch/i386/lib] Error 2
When I checked the file checksum.c I noticed that in line 105 I find the
following definition:
unsigned int csum_partial_copy_fromuser(const char *src, char *dst,int len,
int sum)
And in line 200 there is the following:
unsigned int csum_partial_copy(const char *src, char *dst,int len, int sum)
Does anybody have any idea about what could be happening? 
Thank you very much.
Alejandro
