I've been discussing this with Pavel for quite some time and my opinion is
that moving the image-writing and reading functionality of swsusp
to the user space makes sense from the technical point of view.
For example it would allow us to add the image encryption (real, eg.
with a passphrase-protected key), image compression, and image
verification in a rather straightforward way.  These are important
functionalities, at least for some users.
However, I think we should not try to read and/or set up kernel
data structures from the users space.  Instead, we can create an interface
that will allow us to convey the image data and metadata from the
kernel to the user space and vice versa.
Greetings,
Rafael
