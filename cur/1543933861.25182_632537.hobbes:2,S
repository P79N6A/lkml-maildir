It's a little more complicated. gcc 4.x (not sure which x, might 0) 
is clever enough to not use max() stack, but only use the stack for the 
different scopes as needed similar as when the calls weren't inlined. 
But gcc 3 didn't do that.

Yes exactly.  If the functions weren't inlined the problem wouldn't
occur because the stack sizes do not add up in the same dynamic call chain. 
Thus a few statetic noinlines will fix it.
