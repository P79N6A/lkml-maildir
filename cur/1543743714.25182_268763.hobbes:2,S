You can just place a file in /etc/udev/rules.d; your distribution may
have files (50-udev.rules) in there already, but if you create a file
which is lexically before them (10-local.rules), rules in it will take
precedence -- well, be parsed first -- and your distribution should
not overwrite your file.
