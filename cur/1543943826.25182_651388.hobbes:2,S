I don't think I fully understand what's going on here.  So here's what
I've been able to glean; hopefully someone who understands this better
can help out.
I happen to have an E7525-based machine, so here's an lspci of bus 0:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation E7525 Memory Controller Hub (rev 0a)

The line in question reads:
        /* read xTPR register */
        raw_pci_read(0, 0, 0x40, 0x4c, 2, &word);
That's domain 0, bus 0, device 8, function 0, address 0x4c, length 2.
I've checked the public E7525 and E7520 MCH datasheets, and they don't
document the xTPR registers; nor do any of the devices in the datasheet
have registers documented at 0x4c.
You can see from my lspci above that I don't _have_ a device 8 on bus 0.
The aforementioned documentation says:
"A disabled or non-existent device's configuration register space is
hidden. A disabled or non-existent device will return all ones for reads
and will drop writes just as if the cycle terminated with a Master Abort
on PCI."
Now, my E7525 isn't affected by this quirk as it has a revision greater
than 0x9.  So maybe it's expected that device 8 is hidden on my machine;
that it's only present on revisions up to 0x9.  But maybe device 8 is
always hidden, and that's why the author used raw_pci_ops?
We can still do better than this, though.  We can do:
-	raw_pci_read(0, 0, 0x40, 0x4c, 2, &word);
+	pci_bus_read_config_word(dev->bus, PCI_DEVFN(8, 0), 0x4c, &word);
Using PCI_DEVFN tells people you really did mean device 8, and it's not
a braino for device 4 or 2 (how many bits for slot and function again?)
I'll see if I can dig up the internal documentation for the xTPR register
when I'm at work on Monday.  But I've never gone looking for internal
documentation before, so I have no idea how easy it will be to find ;-)
