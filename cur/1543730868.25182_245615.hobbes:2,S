I find losing mtime annoying.  That's why I don't use Mozilla's
download manager (and Navigator's before it) because they presumed
that mtime isn't worth copying.  ncftp and wget do the right thing,
but it's annoying that I can't use the fancy tools and get the
metadata _I_ want transferred by them.

Note that file-as-directory doesn't imply that you can store just
anything into those directories.
Is it a problem to decree that "file data MUST NOT be stored in a
metadata directory; only non-essential metadata and data computed from
the file data may be stored"?

Same as xattrs, for data that should be stored.
But, unlike xattrs, while permissions and C-source-encoding should be
stored, some of this metadata should _not_ be stored when making an
archive and perhaps not when making a backup either.
Personally I wouldn't want an archive containing a file to save and
restore recomputable metadata like cached, extracted-on-demand MP3 id
tags and email headers-as-metadata.  I'd rather they were recalculated
when needed, implying a stronger guarantee about their relationship to
the data from which they're extracted - and implying that a user
program might not be allowed to set them to inconsistent values.
