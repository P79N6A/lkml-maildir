I have two questions:
1) ISA-PnP detection in the kernel doesn't work properly on my Abit KT7
(the card in question is a SoundBlaster AWE64), but userspace ISA-PnP works
fine...
2) I'm trying to pass options to the SoundBlaster driver using LILO - it's
built into the kernel - but can't figure out the correct syntax to use the
append = "..." option in this context.  I need to do the equivalent of
"options sb io=0x220 dma=1,6 irq=7", which is what the BIOS reports
configuring the card as at boot time.  Yes, i've tried using it as a
module, but it stopped working when I recompiled the kernel with Radeon DRM
support and K7 optimisations.
Any pointers?
