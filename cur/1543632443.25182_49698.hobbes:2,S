To get *good* performance from such a large SGA, it's best to use a -aa
kernel I've found. Either 2.4.18-aa + whatever patches, or something
similar. But there's been some fixes/changes/optimizations to the -aa
tree with regards to large memory boxes. 
I'm curious though how P4 HT will play into that performance on the new
Xeons though. I'll have more to report in the next few weeks.
