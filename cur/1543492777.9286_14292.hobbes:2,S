I assume you're primarily talking about write caching...

/proc/sys/vm/bdflush is the file you're looking for. If
you limit the dirty buffers to 1%, Linux will simply push
any dirty buffers out to disk and (since the buffer cache
is now very easy to clear away) will have a very small
amount of buffer cache.
The normal file cache you probably want to keep anyway since
that is where Linux keeps track of the data it mmap()s, that
includes executable data and libraries...
(I assume you'll do quite a bit of mmap()ing on your large
system)
