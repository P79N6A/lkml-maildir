Subject: knfsd and exporting mounts points...

I take it exporting of a filesystem tree with multiple mount points
isn't implemented still. From the looks of it CONFIG_SUN_NFSD simply
prevents a permission error rather than actually exporting mount points.
If there is a patch available please let me know where it is :)
