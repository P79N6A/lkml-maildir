Perhaps, but there seems to be a lot of talk about introducing new APIs 
where it isn't entirely clear that it is needed.  Sorry if that sounded 
rather acerbic.

Things were like that at one point in time, but file descriptors turn out 
to introduce a huge gaping security hole with SUID programs.  The problem 
is that any event context is closely tied to the address space of the 
thread issuing the syscalls, and file descriptors do not have this close 
binding.

My arguement is that this approach introduces a slow path into the heavily 
loaded server case.  If you can show me how to avoid that, I'd be happy to 
see such an implementation. =-)

Except that you're not usually pulling a full ring worth of events at a 
time, more often just one.  One of the driving forces behind AIO use is 
in realtime apps where you don't want to eat occasional spikes in the 
latency of request processing, one just wants to eat the highest priority 
event then work on the next.  By keeping each step small and managable, 
the properties of the system are much easier to predict.  Yes, batching 
can be helpful performance-wise, but it is somewhat opposite to the design 
criteria that need to be considered.  The right way to cope with that may 
be to have two different modes of operation that trade off one way or the 
other on the batching question.
