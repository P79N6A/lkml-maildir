That can not be done, because I'll need to do write-to-swapspace with those
processes frozen, and if they hold some semaphores, that may not be
possible.

I believe it should work with RT as-is. SMP is another issue, I'll
probably wait for hotplug-cpu patches for that. (I do not want to save
state of secondary cpu's).
