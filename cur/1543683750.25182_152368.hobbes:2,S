Hmm. The previous change was not because there is something
intrinsically good with some way of numbering partitions,
but because it is very inconvenient when partition numbering
changes.
Thus, the previous patch made OSF in 2.6 do as it did in 2.4.
But here the 2.6 behaviour is already that of 2.4.21, and you
change away from that. Not a good idea.
