It does - event is copied into shared buffer, but place (or index in the
ring buffer) is selected by userspace (wrapper, glibc, anything).
It is simple and (from my point of view) elegant, but it will not be used - 
I surrender and implement kenelspace ring buffer management right now, I 
just said that it is possible to implement any kind of ring buffer in 
userspace with old kevent_get_events() syscall only.
