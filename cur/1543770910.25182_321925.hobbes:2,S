If you use /dev/ entries to directly address SCSI targets, then you 
are relying on on assumptions that cannot be granted everywhere.
Cdrecord is portable and this needs to implement a way that is portable 
and does not rely on nonportable assumptions like yours.

Well if the udev program was polite to users, it would also support
to edit /etc/default/cdrecord...... 
... if it _really_ does wat you like with /dev/ links, then it has all 
the information that is needed to also maintain /etc/default/cdrecord
