WHOA Gents!
Let me get some popcorn to watch this p-contest.
The way you guys are sniping at each other sounds like the good-old days,
when everyone railed me and the subsystem and ended up railing back

Alan, give Bart a break ... cause there is no way I am coming back for a
three-pete.
Cheers,
Andre
