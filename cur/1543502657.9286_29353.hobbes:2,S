This may work for you this way, but never will do so for me. :-)  Adding
threads, pipes, useless synchronisations or any kind of other plumbing to
band-aid the O/S from user space is the way I am not going to follow when
I can do different. Anyway, I am not sure your proposal is portable and it
was probably just sci-fi 10 years ago. I do prefer my 10 years old hack.

The problem of UNIX system API could have been that original designers
only thought to files as generic O/S objects. If they had thought to
hamburgers instead, may-be they would have designed the thing a better
way, since they couldn't miss the following: 
   You can order your hamburger, then read your newspaper while somebody 
   is preparing it, being sure that you will be told when your hamburger 
   will be ready. And you also have the option to ask for the thing to 
   be brought to you when ready. ;-)
To people who may want to flame, I say that the above is just a joke.
Or may-be it is not completely so, or it is not this way that you have 
to deal with such kind of meals in the US. ;-)
