Too old fileutils, and maybe glibc. They do not handle >2GB files.
And 'rm', for some strange reason, first 'lstat' file before removing
it. As workaround, do:
cd lost+found
for a in *; do echo > $a; done
rm *
BTW, who created that files? Maybe there is some way to get through
2GB limit check without saying O_LARGEFILE? But more probably stupid 
software using O_LARGEFILE without knowing consequences...
