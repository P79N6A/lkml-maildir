This is because radeonfb chooses directcolor for its visual.  With RGB565,
the depth == 16, true.  However, unlike truecolor where color values are
hardwired to linear values, directcolor looks at the hardware CLUT.
So, with directcolor RGB656, these are the CLUT lengths:
Red and Blue = 32 (2 ^ 5)
Green        = 64 (2 ^ 6)
(And you can see this in radeonfb_base:radeonfb_setcolreg())
		if (rinfo->bpp == 16) {
			pindex = regno * 8;
			if (rinfo->depth == 16 && regno > 63)
				return 1;
			if (rinfo->depth == 15 && regno > 31)
				return 1;
However, linux_logo_224 requires a CLUT with these lengths:
Red = Green = Blue = 224;
So, linux_logo_224 cannot be drawn when visual is directcolor at RGB555 or
RGB565 because the logo clut requirements exceeds the hardware clut
capability. You need to use a logo image with a lower depth such as the
16-color logo, linux_logo_16.
In short, fb_get_color_depth() and radeonfb both do the correct thing, but
you need a logo with a lower color depth. Or choose RGB888 or higher, or
set the visual to truecolor.

PS: Note that this behavior is the same as 2.4 behavior (224-color logo is
only chosen if directcolor and bpp >= 24).  It might have worked before, and
this is probably due to the directcolor clut being ramped to truecolor
values. However, the correct solution is to use a 16-color logo.
