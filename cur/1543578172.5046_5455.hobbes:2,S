Tim and I have been looking at this offline. The significance
of lk 2.3.43 was the addition of a new sg driver that has an
additional interface. Recent versions of SANE use that newer
sg interface. The problem that Tim reported seemed to be caused
by timeouts ** resulting in scsi bus resets. Anyway the problem
seems to disappear with the recently released SANE 1.0.4 .
[The original report was based on SANE 1.0.3 and earlier.]
There is also a problem report with the  SnapScan 1236 <--> aha152x 
combination also based on SANE 1.0.3 . This one is looking 
like an "uninitialized errno" bug fixed in SANE 1.0.4 .
** SANE's newer sg interface shortens the per command timeout
from 10 minutes to 10 seconds. Most other OSes interfaces in
SANE have a timeout value of 1 minute or more. I suspect 10 
seconds may be too short.
