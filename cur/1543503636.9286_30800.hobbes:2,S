What fb driver are you using? The normal ATI Rage driver will not
correctly initialize the LCD port part of the chip - at least it did not
in <= 2.2.5 kernels. You have to use VESA FB.
But apart from that: Have you tried 
http://marc.mutz.com/X/
 as a
possible solution to your X problem? It features a patched X server for
use with the 1024x768 resolution _only_. There are other links, however,
that discuss 800x600, too.
Hope that helps...
Marc
