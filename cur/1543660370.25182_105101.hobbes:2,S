a) a little but of math helps, on a 1GHz pentium 16000 nops is only
about 5-6 usecs. This is superscalar machines that do three inst per
clock.
b) are you in user space or kernel space?
c) if the answer in b) is that your doing some embedded stuff, you Q on
if it matter if you're in real or protected mode indicate that, then
you're on the wrong mailing list. pls stop posting .
d) 1 sec cpu time, or wall time?
e) do you want to sleep, or burn CPU cycles?
f) why assembly?
