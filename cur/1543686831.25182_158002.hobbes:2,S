This should be safe.  raid5 only ever submits 1-page (4K) requests
that are page aligned, and linear arrays will have the boundary
between drives 4k aligned (actually "chunksize" aligned, and chunksize
is atleast 4k). 
So raid5 should be safe over everything (unless dm allows striping
with a chunk size less than pagesize).
Thinks: as an interim solution of other raid levels - if the
underlying device has a merge_bvec_function which is being ignored, we
could set max_sectors to PAGE_SIZE/512.  This should be safe, though
possibly not optimal (but "safe" is trumps "optimal" any day).
