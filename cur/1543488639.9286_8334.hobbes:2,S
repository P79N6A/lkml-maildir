There are two things here - one you are using a fairly modern egcs. This
_should_ not matter. #2 is that 2.2.2ac7 has newer generic scsi code than
ac5. 
So can you try 2.2.2ac5 (built with the same compiler as ac7) and let me
know if that behaves. Also if that behaves make sure you can duplicate the
problem reasonably easily with ac7. You may have found a bug in the new
scsi generic code.
