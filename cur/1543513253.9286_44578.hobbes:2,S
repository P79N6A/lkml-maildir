Tools like top and ps from ps-99.4.14 (build 17 from SuSE) hang hard
when run (ie. won't be killed by -9).  Of course, I have init-scripts
which use ps to find the pid, so it won't shutdown cleanly.  The rest
of the system seems to run fine.
System: BP6 SMP, enabled support for IrDA, USB, APM and other goodies.
(I had to change memory_end to *memory_end_p to get it to compile.)
BTW, I have been unable to get PPP to work in any 2.3.x, it complains
that it can't find support in the kernel.  I see others get it to work
if they compile it into the kernel.  I'm running ppp 2.3.10.  Do I
have to upgrade some tools?
