I rather see lots of wasting rather than performance, here. Bonnie says
that your subsystem can sustain 103 MB/s write but only 41 MB/s read. This
looks about 60% throughput wasted for read.
Note that if you intend to use it only for write-only applications,
performance are not that bad, even if just dropping the data on the floor
would give you infinite throughput without any difference in
functionnality. :-)
