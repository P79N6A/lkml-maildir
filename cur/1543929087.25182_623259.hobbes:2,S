Hi David,

> outstanding bugs.
> 
> I'd like to let the driver pass through LKML and then let it

> Driver is released under GPL, original authorship belongs to
> Symmetric co. Jiri Kosina has fixed some bugs and made it work
> with recent kernels, and I work on improving the code to
> match linux kernel standards.

can we please drop the stupid "_cs" stuff. It is an old habit to have
the shortcut for "Card Services" in the driver name, but that goes back
to the time when the PCMCIA subsystem and its drivers were an external
package. Especially in cases where only a PCMCIA card exists, it makes
no sense anymore.

Marcel
