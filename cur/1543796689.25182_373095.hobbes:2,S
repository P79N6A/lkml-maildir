So it can, thanks.

I had been under the impression that the stack was supposed to make sure
that no poll() is running before the driver close() gets called?  I
could well be missing something there, though.  Indeed, now that I think
about it the calls netif_poll_disable() in suspend() ought to mean that
we don't need to look at hands_off inside poll().
