The Dell 4100 is a 815e based machine with nVidia 32Mb video card and
Creative SB Live! audio card.   I've added by own Tulip card into it.
I'm running 2.2.16 kernel.  There's a *lot* of unknown PCI devices in
this system :-(  I've included full lspci output below.
At boot time...
PCI_IDE: unknown IDE controller on PCI bus 00 device f9, VID=8086, DID=244b
PCI_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
Will this stop the system running the hard disks at full available speed?
