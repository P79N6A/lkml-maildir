[I'm not familiar with an 8139too version more recent than what is in
2.3.46. Is rc still the return value of pci_register_driver()? Then you
can simplify things as rc will always be >= 0.]
Anyway, a generic solution looks like this:
---
/* module stays resident iff CONFIG_HOTPLUG and compiled into kernel */
#if !defined(CONFIG_HOTPLUG) || defined(MODULE)
	rc = (rc > 0) ? 0 : (rc == 0 ? -ENODEV : rc);
#else
	rc = (rc >= 0) ? 0 : rc;
#endif
if (rc < 0)	/* Cleanup if we encountered an error... */
	pci_unregister_driver (&rtl8139_pci_driver);
return rc;
---
Simple, cleaner and much more capable than a macro approach. Think of a
driver that calls some more functions that might fail in its init routine.
The driver writer has to remember the call to pci_unregister_driver()
anyway in the error path. So I don't think it's wise to hide this call for
one failure case only. Let's just use the clean logic in current drivers
so future driver writers have an easy to understand scheme to adopt.
Regards,
Daniel.
