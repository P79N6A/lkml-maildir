Agreed.  But, storing random IVs someplace doesn't sound very righteous.
Several months ago, as an experiment, I generated a large kernel module
(called loop_rand) filled with data taken from /dev/random.  I then 
modified the kerneli twofish code to derive IVs based on both the real_block 
and data taken from the table.  My twofish notes to myself:
 * Jan 17, 1999 - Added exploitation of module loop_rand.  This table 
 *		  contains a fairly large number of 96 bit entries of
 *                random data.  A 128 bit block IV is derived by computing
 *                IV = E( real_block + loop_rand[ mod(real_block/entries ] ) 
 *                        <-32bits-> + <-----------96bits---------------->
 *                     <---------------------128 bit IV ------------------->
 *
 *                The implication is now that two secrets must be known
 *                to recover the data: 1) The 128 bit key (pass phrase hash)
 *                and 2) the loop_rand kernel module (which is intended to
 *                be stored on *OTHER* than the encrypted disk)(preferably
 *                a diskette which is stored seperately from the machine).
The stength of the cipher should remain in the key, not in the IVs.  I am
not comfortable with my loop_rand work, it strikes me as an overkill.  
I think your #2 idea is perfect.  Suppose one were to develop a
"filesystem signature" in losetup as a hash of the fully qualified 
device/file name, stuff that into the loop_device structure, and then have 
loop.c pass IV =  relative_block + signature into the transfer module. 
The result is both relocatable and avoids duplication of ciphertext... 
the best of both worlds.
Your thoughts?
Reed,
P.S.
<RANT>
I could easily do this work in an evening.  However, silly USA export 
laws prevent me from changing loop.c from a BSD vnode psuedo device into 
a crypto API.  
Such is life behind the crypto iron curtain.  I sincerely hope that
others in the world will continue to grow the technology.  USA based 
skill does atrophy behind clueless regulation.
