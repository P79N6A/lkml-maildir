That sounds like a great idea, but I'm not sure it could be realized short
of a major rewrite. Look how hard Ingo and Con are working just to get a
single node doing a good job with interactive and throughput tradeoffs.
Once they get a good handle on identifying process behaviour, and I
believe they will, that information could be used in improving NUMA
performance, by sending not just 'a job" but "the right job" if it exists.
I'm sure there are still a few graduate theses possible on the topic!
