The title is "2.5.59 and 2.5.50-mm2".  I assume it should be 2.5.59-mm2??

OK, thanks.
The important thing about direct-io is that it will frequently cause multiple
I/Os to be in flight against the same disk sector.  That will never happen
with regular I/O because the pagecache acts as a synchronisation point.
Probably, this has tickled a bug in the I/O scheduler.  Possibly in
direct-io, too - that code's fairly fresh, and quite complex.
