Some? Alot? Musthave?
To me it just changed the manner in which the hands are waving.
Actually, I like the current names because ALLOC_HIGH explicitly
is used for __GFP_HIGH allocations, and MUSTHAVE is not really
an improvement on NO_WATERMARKS.
However if you'd really like to change the names, I'd prefer them
to be more consistent, eg:
ALLOC_DIP_NONE
ALLOC_DIP_LESS
ALLOC_DIP_MORE
ALLOC_DIP_FULL
