Probably so, I was under the false assumption that even built-in modules
should use EXPORT_SYMBOL.

Actually, they don't call each others functions at all (except for the
one we discuss below)... But if input-ff.o would be allowed as a module,
device drivers would either need to know at the build time if input-ff.o
is enabled (not an option, as it could be built as a module afterwards),
_or_ query input.o if the input-ff.o is registered in. However the
latter causes again the situation that nothing depends on input-ff.o and
it is never loaded...

I guess I could just use the normal event() handler in input_dev:
FF-capable input-drivers should assign input_ff_event() as the event()
or call input_ff_event() in their own event() handler.
Hmm, just came to me mind that input.o can be built as module if
EMBEDDED is set. But input-ff.o doesn't actually require input.o (it's
just not useful without it), so input-ff.o as a built-in wouldn't be a
problem. That's why I wanted them to be in a single module (so that if
input.o is a module, input-ff.o would also be part of that module
instead of being built-in). But I don't think there is someone who runs
with EMBEDDED enabled, INPUT as a module, INPUT_FF_EFFECTS enabled, and
doesn't like that input-ff.o cannot be built as a module.
So, I guess we go for a separate input-ff.o as a bool.
Unless you have any more thoughts, I'll make patches for (1) separate
input-ff.o from input.o so that input.c renaming is not required, and to
(2) use the input_dev->event() handler instead of input.o calling
input-ff.o.
