once upon a time, i'd proposed just adding a couple new "config"
entries, but i eventually decided that a better approach would be
to define a whole new Kconfig directive, as in:
config FUBAR
	maturity EXPERIMENTAL (or DEPRECATED or OBSOLETE or ...)
that would require extra processing in the parser, but it would allow
the "maturity" attribute to be used for all sorts of new and wacky
things, such as automatically displaying it at the end of a config
selection, or deselecting everything OBSOLETE in a build, etc.
how hard would it be to add processing like that to the Kconfig
infrastructure?
