Hooray!  That's great and that's the way I'd like to keep it.  Do you think
you can do that on a 64 way SMP?  Not much chance, right?

That's a red herring, there are not 64 routers in either picture, there
are 64 ethernet interfaces in both pictures.  So let me rephrase the
question: given 64 ethernets, 64 CPUs, on one machine, what's easier,
1 multithreaded networking stack or 64 independent networking stacks?
