It would have been nice if you had put the autors of the files on Cc:
Regarding the PPChameleon NAND support: I discussed this issue with
tglx on 23 June 2006. Thomas promised to fix the driver if I send him
the missing file and eventually needed patches.
I did so on Fri, 23 Jun 2006 23:23:42 +0200.
Thomas, can you please have a look at this?
If you don't have time / resources please let me know so we can submit
the stuff here on the list...
Thanks.
Best regards,
Wolfgang Denk
