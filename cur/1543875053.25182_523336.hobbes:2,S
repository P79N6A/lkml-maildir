Hi!
> This supports the new clk_must_disable() interface for AT91 systems:
> 
>  - Implement the call, replacing at91_suspend_entering_slow_clock()
>    and eliminating various "that's not exported" build warnings;
> 
>  - Use it in three drivers: USB Host, USB Peripheral, and RS232 serial.

> Briefly, those are three of the drivers that need to act differently when

> other things they can't act as wakeup event sources without using the
> clocks which are disabled in those deeper sleep states.

> currently implement wake-on-LAN even in the "standby" mode.)

FWIW, it looks okay to me. But you probably need to cc akpm if you
want it merged...
