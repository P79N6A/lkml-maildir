I'd be interested in knowing the results.

Yes, I know that these things can theorectically happen.  But when it happens
to me, it's a suprise.  To an electronics genius, he probably encounters it 
more often. =)

What I'd like to know is where the sound chip is really at on my board.  I've 
tried looking before, but find myself confused.
A pic:

According to a diagram that I have, it points to an AC'97 6-CH AUDIO as a chip
near of the top of the board in the image that I link to, above 2nd PCI slot 
left of the AGP.  But I'm am also left thinking, how does the NForce2 MCP come 
into play.  Specs would help.  Maybe if we can figure out how the sound is 
wired on the board, we could also trace the source of noise to the exact 
component.
