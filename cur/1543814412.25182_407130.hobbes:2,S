sector_t is 8bytes on normal configuration and there are many
variables for blocks on ext2/3.  I thought extending variables may
influence on performance, so I didn't change.

Is it s_block_group_nr in ext3_super_block?
mke2fs sets 65535 to the field if the number of block groups is greater
than 65535.  Current kernel ignores the field and re-calculate from
other fields.  findsuper command is the only user of it and it simply prints
the value.  So, it does not limit the maximum size of the filesystem to 8 TB.
I  confirmed that mke2fs with my change could make the filesysytem
which has more than 65536 groups and it could be mounted.

Ok, I'll split it later.

Thank you, I missed it.  I'm looking forward to seeing your report.

Ok, I'll remove them when I update the patch next time.
They are left because I'm considering enlarging the file size max too...

Because ext3_alloc_branch calls ext3_alloc_block with int type for the
block number and ext3_alloc_blocks returns int type.

Ok, I'll update them too.
