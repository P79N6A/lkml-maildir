So you're opposing the sound-* stuff, and agree on the char-major-14
soundcore?
The current default is char-major-14 sound, which is stupid, because
soundcore is the module that actually registers the chardevice.
Maybe we should just leave the sound-service- stuff to the
user/distribution
install procedure...
But again, the current default char-major-14 sound is stupid, it causes
sound.o to be loaded even if the sound driver is not ISA and does not
need sound.o.
