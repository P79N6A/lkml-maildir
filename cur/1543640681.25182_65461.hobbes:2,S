this again would mean that i would have to poll the /proc/interrupt file.
i want to avoid polling because of very small poll interval causing
overhead. i am still wondering if this could be implemented with some sort
of interrupt mechanism in linux (kernel interrupting user program or user
program waiting on some signal)
