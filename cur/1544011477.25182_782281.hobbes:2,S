Subject: [PATCH 3/6] drm/i915: fix sparse warnings: move 'extern' decls to header file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/18/372

Move 'extern'-decls from "intel_dvo.c" to "dvo.h", as "dvo.h" is
included by and only by files where the symbols are either defined or
used.
Fix this sparse warnings:
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/dvo_ch7xxx.c:358:26: warning: symbol 'ch7xxx_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/dvo_ch7017.c:444:26: warning: symbol 'ch7017_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/dvo_ivch.c:432:26: warning: symbol 'ivch_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/dvo_tfp410.c:325:26: warning: symbol 'tfp410_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/dvo_sil164.c:292:26: warning: symbol 'sil164_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
