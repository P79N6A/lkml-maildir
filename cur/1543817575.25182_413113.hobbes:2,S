Yes, It would be nice to be able to match the Linux client side that can 
go to 1MB.

Like you said it will need match more work to do it right and also not 
waste space for all RPC request to which the maximum possible size is 
allocated up front. But until than way not take advantage of this minor 
change that can give us significant performance improvement. I run with 
NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE set to 64K (the only change I made) and saw 10%-15% 
improvement for NFS reads. Is there anyone out there that is looking at 
making this improvement ?
