  Hi, all. Version 199.7 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
This is against 2.4.18-pre3. Highlights of this release:
- Unregister /dev/root symlink prior to creating second one (for
  initrd)
- Added support for multiple Compaq cpqarray controllers
- Fixed (rare, old) race in <devfs_lookup>
				Regards,
					Richard....
