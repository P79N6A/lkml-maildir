yes I will run all my standard testsuites before we take this patch.
(DSS workload, iozone, sysbench). I will get back with some results
sooon. Probably by the end of this week.
Also I think the bug that Miklos, found is really hard to reproduce. Did
he find this bug by code inspection? Its really really hard to get into
a state where the current window is of size 1 page with zero pages in
the readahead window, and then the sequential read pattern to just right
then.
