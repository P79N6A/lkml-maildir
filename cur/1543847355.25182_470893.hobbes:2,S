You're right, some places have such issues, I just considered how to 
avoid the lock
or atomic operation, Andrew ever mentioned the lock is unacceptible in 
file system
 code path, so I always avoid the lock or atomic operation.

Only rmmod will set exit_flag, other users are readers, so I think the 
lock is unnecessary,
 only one issue is that I  should clear fsevent_queue in the last 
section of fsevent_exit.

in include/linux/fsevent.h, it is possibly accessed from diffrent cpus, 
so atomic is necessary.

maybe that surplus skb_get is the root cause.

It is hard a bit for the subsystem using the hook mechanism to be 
implemented as
 a module. In fact, all the newly-added code in this patch is for 
modularity. :)
Really that is a way to build as a static infrastructure, the filesystem 
init code calls
 a fsevent register API to enable it, but unregister is not a trivial, 
the syncronization
issue still exists.  Nevertheless, this is really is a way I can try.

I think your "reschedule" means process migration, those code just considers
 this issue, missed_refcnt is just for this, start_cpuid is used to 
identify the cpu
before migration, end_cpuid is used to identify the cpu after migration, if
start_cpuid is equal to end_cpuid, we can think there is no migration 
happened,
 otherwise, missed_refcnt[start_cpuid] will increase, because there are 
possibly
 several prcoesses on different cpus to modify this value, so it is 
defined as
atomic.

Only rmmod will change __raise_fsevent and it will set it to 0 just after
all the filesystem code paths nerver call it, if reference count on anuy cpu
 is not -1, rmmod will wait for it until this cpu doesn't call raise_fsevent
 any more, rmmod will set it to 0 just after all the reference count on 
all the
cpu are -1, so only one user -- rmmod -- is accessing it in that time, 
this is
safe.
