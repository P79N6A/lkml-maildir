Good.

Now this is an argument I can _completely_ buy into.
Considering XF86_FBdev to be a "interim" thing I can fully understand. 
What I do NOT understand is the mentality that some people seem to have
that "it is a bug to try to use anything _but_ XF86_FBdev with CONFIG_FB". 
For X servers where the mode switching works even together with CONFIG_FB
(and yes, there are tons of people that seem to use CONFIG_FB together
with some accelerated servers already), I would think we _want_ to use
those accelerated X servers - possibly with a caveat that they aren't
guaranteed to work. But the mentality that "if you have CONFIG_FB you have
to use XF86_FBdev" must go, imho. Jes, do you understand?
I already applied a documentation patch by Jes from to 2.2.0pre4 saying
that CONFIG_FB is not necessarily a good idea if you can avoid it. But
Jes, if you continue to say that if you run CONFIG_FB you _cannot_ run any
other X server, then I will just change the config option to something
like CONFIG_SCREEN_SLOW_X and change the documentation to match to make
_sure_ nobody ever does it even by mistake.
