| Oh, one other thing.  An updated patch for 2.4.20 is up:

Hi Robert:
AFAICT, the leak is still there. I'll be looking at that in a bit. I
used the following to get it to compile on the PPC box. I'm not sure if
it's 100% correct, but it appears to work:
diff -ur linux-2.4.20-preempt/arch/ppc/kernel/mk_defs.c linux-2.4.20-ben/arch/ppc/kernel/mk_defs.c
--- linux-2.4.20-preempt/arch/ppc/kernel/mk_defs.c	2003-04-12 02:57:31.000000000 -0400
+++ linux-2.4.20-ben/arch/ppc/kernel/mk_defs.c	2003-04-13 13:57:00.000000000 -0400

It just adds a DEFINE() for the use of CPU() in arch/ppc/kernel/entry.S.
Thanks,
