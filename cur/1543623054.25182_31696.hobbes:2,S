Random comment:
It's design documentation that's needed.  Looking at the code you can see 
what it's doing, but you sometimes have to read an amazing amount of it to 
even guess at WHY...  The code doesn't always tell you about the author's 
intentions, just the implementation.  And sometimes the code is wrong 
anyway...
I believe the kernelnewbies project is working on this, but haven't been able 
to follow it.  (I just moved back to Austin, am recovering from food 
poisioning, picking an old job back up...  Not following much of anything at 
the moment...)
