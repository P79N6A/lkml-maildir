Hi all,
I have a customized Linux which supports a serial console interface.
I am able to successfully ssh into this Linux system. If I try to use any of 
the secure (ssh, scp) programs from this ssh session, I am able to 
successfully use them. If I try the same program from the serial console, I 
get a "Login failed: Permission denied" message.
Since the same userid is able to login from/to this system from a ssh 
session into this box, I presume that this eliminates any user-specific or 
ssh-configuration-specific problems/issues?
Are there any known limitations in running the ssh/scp programs on the 
/dev/console interface? It does not allow me to enter the password on this 
session and then quickly scrolls out to the attempt till it fails in the 3rd 
attempt and reports the failure?
Here is the relevant output:
