        The last 2.5 series kernel that had the floppy driver working fine for 
me, was 2.5.7. I want to say it was in 2.5.13 that it was broken. But tread 
warily with anything that early in the tree. there's bound to be a number of 
things that were being broken back then. 2.5.7 was the last in which 
everything that I needed worked for me.
                                                        BL.
