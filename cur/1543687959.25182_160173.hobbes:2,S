Since Alan is no longer around to maintain the -ac series, I've ported the 
latest -ac patch to 2.4.22.
It can be downloaded at
http://www.arklinux.org/~bero/kernel/patch-2.4.22-pac1.bz2
[pac is short for "Ported -ac"].
I'll keep syncing changes that make sense, and adding other stuff [like 
updated ACPI patches etc.] for a while [at least until we're ready to move 
to 2.6 fulltime].
