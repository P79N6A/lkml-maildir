I _thought_ that's what you meant, but then I was also thinking that the
dentry hash was on the full path name and not just the filename?  This
wouldn't be any good for use in the directory index, in case the directory
is renamed.  If this is _not_ the case, then it is a definite candidate.

I was thinking about this as well.  Since the setup Daniel has allows us
to store a hash version, we could run the hash function on a fixed string
at SB init time to give us a hash "version" number.  If the hash function
changes we will get a new hash "version".  We could inline each new dentry
hash function into the ext2 code (so we can unpack the directories), or
as a cop-out if any directory has a hash version not equal to the current
one we re-hash all the entries in the directory.
Cheers, Andreas
