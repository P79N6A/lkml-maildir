* 2.6.8.1-mm2 minus just dev-mem-restriction-patch.patch fixes the "cannot
  allocate memory" problem.
* 2.6.8.1-mm2 minus dev-mem-restriction-patch.patch and
  get_user_pages-handle-VM_IO.patch fixes both the "cannot allocate memory"
  and "get_user_pages() returns -EFAULT" problems.
"Cannot allocate memory" may be specific to older vmware 3.2.0 since it
hasn't been reported by anyone else (even though the patch is present in
Fedora).
