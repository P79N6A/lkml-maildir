In my version of the patch (which I assume is what Steve grabbed) the
first thing nfs_cached_lookup() does is to call nfs_revalidate_inode(). 
It may well be that the directory attribute cache has not timed out yet.
If so, that will indeed cause the mtime not to be checked on the client.
If this really is a problem for you, then I suggest you make the
directory attribute caching less aggressive. 'man 5 nfs' and read up on
"acdirmin/acdirmax".
