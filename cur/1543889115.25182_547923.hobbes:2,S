Just so. What is being quantified is the rate of slowdown due to 
external load. I would hope that each IPC method would slow by some 
similar factor.

The original intent was purely to measure IPC speed under no load 
conditions, since fairness is in vogue I also attempted to look for 
surprising behavior. Corresponding values under equal load may be useful 
in relation to one another, but this isn't (and hopefully doesn't claim 
to be) a benchmark. It may or may not be useful viewed in that light, 
but that's not the target.

And that's a very good point, either multiple copies or more forked 
processes might be useful, and I do intend to add threaded tests on the 
next upgrade, but perhaps a whole new code might be better for 
generating the load you suggest.
