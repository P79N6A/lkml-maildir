Hmmm, I don't know of any reiserfs bugs in 2.4.6 that look like this.  You
might have found a new one, but I think it is more likely a 1 bit error in
the in-ram struct telling reiserfs which block to read in.  If it reads the
wrong block, you've got big problems.
It will be hard to debug for sure until we are positive all the ram in the
box is good.
