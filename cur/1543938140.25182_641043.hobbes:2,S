Well, I'm still thinking you mean "the average energy usage per unit of
computations".  IOW, "one will use more energy to carry out the same
computations with throttling than without it".

In this context "power" means "energy used over a unit of time", so by
decreasing power you cause less energy to be used over a unit of time, by
definition.  Still, the total energy required to complete given computational
task is (on the average) equal to "power" * "total time of computations" and
this really has to be measured on a per task basis.

IMO clock throttling (as opposed to the reduction of the frequency of an idle
CPU) is only useful for preventing the CPU from overheating.
