Hi,
I've just tried the version of the driver included in 2.6.17-rc1 on an x86_64
box (Asus L5D) with a built-in PCI BCM4306 adapter (Broadcom Corporation
BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03)), and unfortunately
it doesn't seem to work.
The driver loads and seems to initialize the adapter, but that's all,
apparently.
First, I compiled the driver with DMA and PIO support, but it hanged my box
solid when I tried "iwconfig eth1 essid on" on it.  On the next boot I noticed
it caused the following messages to appear in dmesg:
nommu_map_single: overflow 58ee7010+2404 of device mask 3fffffff
nommu_map_single: overflow 53669010+2404 of device mask 3fffffff
nommu_map_single: overflow 50180010+2404 of device mask 3fffffff
and so on, down to 455aa010.  Then I thought the adapter might be unable
to DMA for some reason and compiled it with PIO support only.  It did not
hang the box any more, but I couldn't make it work.
It causes the following messages to appear in dmesg:
bcm43xx: set security called
bcm43xx:    .level = 0
bcm43xx:    .enabled = 0
bcm43xx:    .encrypt = 0

and so on.
I used fwcutter 004 to extract the firmvare from the Windows file delivered
with the machine (BCMWL5.SYS).
If you need/want any more information from me, please let me know.
Greetings,
Rafael
