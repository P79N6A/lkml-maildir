Well, it doesn't in my configuration. In fact, there is no function of
dyn_ipaddr at all in my system (even if I use a "echo 1 > ...").
Maybe this is an issue of the combination of pppd and the capi-plugin? I
can remember that I haven't had any problems with pppd and pppoe (and an
early kernel-revision).
