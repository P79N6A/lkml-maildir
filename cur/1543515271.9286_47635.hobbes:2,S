I have been fighting an irritating sound problem for awhile now. While it is
specific to a single application (xmame), I believe it may be kernel related
because a warm reboot ALWAYS fixes it. Basically, after the system has been
up for more than 24 hours or so, every now and then the sound in xmame gets
briefly "stuck", and there is a jerk in the action.
To try to fix this, I have done just about everything I could think of. Of
course, I varied the sound options in xmame, replaced my BH6 v1.01 with a v1.1,
switched to a PCI sound card, and tried the ALSA drivers. Since the ALSA
drivers made no difference, I am still using OSS. These changes made the
problem less noticeable and less frequent, but it still occurs.
To me, I _think_ I have eliminated everthing except the kernel itself, and the
sound modules that are used both in OSS and ALSA. Yes, I have persistent DMA
buffers enabled, but it seems from my symptoms that maybe it isn't working,
since the problem only occurs a good amount of time after boot, when
presumeably memory is fragmented. Is there some way to test and see if the
persistent DMA buffer thing is working when this problem occurs?
My system:
Intel Celeron 300A; BH6 v1.1; 160MB SDRAM; Ultra SCSI and UDMA33 HDDs;
PCI Ensoniq 1371 (used for xmame); SB16 ISA (used for mixing via a patch cable);
Matrox G200 AGP; XFree86 3.3.3.1 (using DGA mode for xmame); RedHat 6.0;
kernel 2.2.13 with ide_2.2.13-19991102_patch
There are no DMA or sound related error messages in the system log.
