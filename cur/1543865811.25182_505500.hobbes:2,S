Subject: [PATCH 1/11] Make hrtimers friendly to vmi
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Highres timers no longer breaks with VMI turned on because the
required function is now exported even with hrtimers turned on.
Until hrtimers becomes the default for i386, we must still support
both timer modes, NO_HZ, and also NO_IDLE_HZ, which is paravirt
specific.
