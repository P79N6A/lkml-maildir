Whoops, that's a bug.  Type "bk sendbug" and send us a bug report, we'll
fix it.  Sorry about that.

It occurs to me that there is no reason you can't generate a regular
patch from BK and mail it to the list w/ the changeset comments.  That
keeps all the non-BK users perfectly happy, nothing has changed for
them and they can use BK or not as they see fit.  In addition, you can
send off a BK patch to Linus and/or stuff a patch into a publicly
available BK tree and point him at it.
If you all can reach any sort of concensus on what is a pleasant patch
format for non-BK users, just tell me, and I'll make sure BK can generate
that sort of patch easily.

Well, send -d is essentially that - it's two patches, a GNU patch and a
BK patch.  It was a mistake for us to wrap the whole thing, we should
leave the regular diffs alone and just wrap the BK stuff.  We can do
that.
