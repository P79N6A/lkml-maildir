Same with SMTP. Someone else mentioned issues with it, and I'm also
experiencing problems. They posted MTU info dumps for my benefit, and I've
been trying to catch an 'ifconfig' output to see what the MTU is at when the
SMTP stalls--but it hasn't happenned since last night. My normal dump looks
like:
[mvance@localhost mvance]$ /sbin/ifconfig
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:3924  Metric:1
          RX packets:3914 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:3914 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol  
          inet addr:128.118.145.15  P-t-P:128.118.97.66  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1524  Metric:1
          RX packets:41595 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:42297 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:10
Otherwise, I'm not sure where/what to starting looking/for.
