That's a common misconception: FreeBSD has no journaling.  It has soft
updates, which is very different indeed.  Soft updates make the
filesystem safe to run after an unclean shutdown by preserving write
dependencies, but they do not make the filesystem consistent at all
times.  You still need to salvage leaked disk blocks, for example.
ext2+journaling is coming.  There have been a couple of releases on
linux-fsdevel@vger, the last of which --- yesterday's --- is now
getting to the point where it is genuinely usable, although there is
still lots to be done.  I'm expecting a fully functional release by
Christmas, but I'm already using it for all the filesystems on my
laptop.
