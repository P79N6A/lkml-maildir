Hmm..that defeats the purpose of making it generic. :(
I was able to build w/o PCI for an SA1100 platform, so I'm assuming 
this is an x86 issue.  I'll dig into it when I get some free time.
I only have x86 and arm toolchains, so can folks on other non-PCI
architectures remove the dmapool-needs-pci.patch and try building 
w/o PCI.
