You could put it into arch/tmp/config.in and do 'lkcc tmp'.
But converting the whole tree is the prefered solution, because lkcc needs 
all the type information of every symbol used in the config file to do a 
good job. The easiest solution is probably to get the 2.5.44 patch from my 
page, generate a diff to your converted 2.5.44 tree and apply this patch 
to 2.5.45. If you send me a 2.5.44 patch of your tree, I can do it for 
you.
bye, Roman
