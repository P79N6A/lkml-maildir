If pids are being reused within seconds of their being freed up,
then the batch managers running on the big HPC systems I care
about are so screwed it isn't even funny.  They depend heavily
on being able to identify the task pids in a job and then doing
something to those tasks (suspend, kill, gather stats, ...).
