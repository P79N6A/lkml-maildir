Sorry for the lengthy delay.
mlock() and mlockall() do the right thing..
however, mmap(MAP_LOCKED) should behave like a    mmap | mlock operation 
according to the manpages. This however was not implemented as the 
transformation from the mmap_flags to vm_flags never checked for MAP_LOCKED
but only for mm->def_flags which only covers a previous mlockall() call.
Hope this clarifies it .
