Nope, you're right. That's very much an issue that I glossed over in
this example. In fact, in the B6 release, I added a remainder field to
the interval structure, but I didn't get to implementing the details. I
do have the code implemented for B7, which I hope to release later this
week.

Great! I think having more minds working at cleaning up this code will
really help. Hopefully having concrete code implementations to compare
will give us additional common ground to work from. 
I think calculating all the adjustments into second overflow doesn't
sound objectionable, although it does seemingly bind us to second
intervals. Having the ntp_advance interface allows the implementation
internally to be flexible for whatever interval. But it doesn't sound
like a major issue at the moment.

Let me know when they've been updated. I've looked over them and have a
few questions that probably would be easily answered with a small
comment.

I'll take a look at this and see if I can do similar. Its a little more
difficult because moving from tick based to continuous adds some
complexity to the simulation.

I'm not too worried about needing separate NTP implementations, as
fundamentally all we do is take a number of adjustment values, merge
them into one adjustment value and apply that as we maintain time. If
the output is a flat per-tick nanosecond adjustment or a continuous
shifted ppm adjustment, the core state machine management will be the
same.

Again, with my smaller set of changes and with your new changes I don't
think fully separate implementations will be required (and even more so
WRT per-timesource ntp implementations). But I think working this from
multiple approaches will better clarify the specific needs we both have.
