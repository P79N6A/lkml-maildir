I experienced drives spinning back up after they had been flushed on
powerdown, which is not necessarily wrong, (I.E. I never noticed any
data loss), but it's not ideal.  Can't we do:
* Standby
* Flush
* Standby
or is there a reason not to?  I know there were discussions about the
right order to do the standyby and flush, and as far as I remember, we
never reached a conclusion :-).
John.
