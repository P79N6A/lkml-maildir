Subject: Accessing # pkts received by kernel through eth0 - failing to get it right

Hi folks
       I am trying to get the number of packets
received by the kernel through the eth0 (only nic card
on the P4 2.2 Ghz machine) in my kernel code (kernel
v2.4.18-3). However, I am not able to get the exact
number of packets received by the kernel, in fact I am
getting quite less packets if compared to the output
shown by tcpdump & tcptrace utility.   
       I am incrementing the tcp_pkt_count and
udp_pkt_count in ip_recv() function (in
net/ipv4/ip_input.c)  when the pkt received is tcp or
udp respectively. But the number of pkts received is
far less as compared to that shown by tcpdump and
tcptrace -l  utility. I even tried to put up a counter
in netif_rx() function (net/core/dev.c) for every
packet received (be it of whichever protocol) but
still the number of pkts rec'd is far less as compared
to what is shown by tcpdump/tcptrace.
    For e.g downloading a file of 37.8 MB in a LAN
through ftp from my machine to adjacent machine,  my
"total_received_pkts" variable in netif_rx() function
in net/core/dev.c file, shows 13930 packets for this
particular file download. The total_received_pkts
variable in netif_rx() is incremented everytime when a
pkt is received by eth0. Now, tcpdump/tcptrace shows
me that total transferred packets are 38752 for this
particular file and maximum segment size (or pkt size)
is 1448 bytes. [The LAN has MTU of 1500 bytes]. 
So there is a great difference (in # pkts received by
the kernel) between what the kernel is showing me and
what the tcpdump/tcptrace shows.  There is no
fragmentation involved on the LAN machines.   
      This makes my received bytes calculation too
wrong (because I am getting wrong number of received
pkts).
     Could anybody please tell me where I am getting
it wrong when the tcpdump/tcptrace utility prints it
right ? I have repeated the experiment several times
(with udp, tcp protocol) but I couldnt get the reason.
     I hope to get a reply.
     Thank you very much for your precious time!
Gautam.
