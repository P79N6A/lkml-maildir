Hello All,
Thanks to the hint of Dries, I discovered that there was a difference
in my kernel configuration and the kernel configuration of Ingo
I streamlined my configuration to that of Ingo, and now the slow boot
issue is completely gone. I do not understand the exact relation, but
it works for me.
Thanks to you all.
FYI: Attached I have put the differences I had to make to make it work.
Kind Regards,
Remy Bohmer
