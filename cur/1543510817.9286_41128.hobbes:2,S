Peter Miller (the author of Aegis), submitted a proposal in March which
provides a much better overview of Aegis. What I provides was meant to glue
the different peices of a source management backend, a bug tracking system and
a peer review system to give people a better grasp on how project management
should work.
Aegis is open source and doesn't seem to have the licensing restrictions of
bitmover (unless the current licensing on the bitmover web site isn't
current). Take a look at it, see how it compares. I have found it to be a
pretty complete management system.
Anyway, his (long) post is available on MARC:
http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=linux-kernel&m=92241232516116&w=2.
Here is the summary:
Summary for the Impatient
        Source management is not enough.  The Linux kernel is more than
        the aggregation of its source files.  A tool which supports the
        the software development process for large teams is required.
        Aegis supports large teams and large projects.  Aegis is designed
        around change sets.  Aegis is designed around repository security
        (availability, integrity and confidentiality).  Aegis' distributed
        development uses this existing mature functionality to keep two
        or more repositories synchronized.
        Aegis supports multiple repositories, multiple lines of
        development, multiple distributed copies of repositories,
        disconnected operation, and is security conscious.
        Aegis is licensed under the GNU GPL.
        Aegis is mature software.  It is 8 years old.  It has users all
        around the world.  It is actively being maintained and enhanced.
        Aegis is easy to use.  Is -is- big, it -does- have a lot of
        functionality, but the essential process can be learned in less
        than a day.
        Aegis is available from

        Please download it, plus one of the template projects, to get a
        feel for the environment.  If you would like more information,
        there is also a Reference Manual and User Guide available from
        the same place.
