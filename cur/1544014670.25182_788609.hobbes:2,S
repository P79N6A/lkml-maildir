ok this part looks funny but it's not really (and it's safe I think).
The async sata thing launches another async thing (the scsi partition
scan).
The synchronize_full() waits for the sata to complete, but doesn't wait
for things that the sata async schedules after the wait started.
is this a problem? not right now, but it means we have a rule that if
an async item schedules another async item, the second one cannot be
__init. (which is ok right now.. scsi already had some of this async
anyway).
I could make the async_full() be more strict if that makes you feel
better, but for this specific purpose it would be over-synchronizing.
