That is even wierdier. The keyboard controller does not respond to the
most basic command. I have seen one report of this happening
(
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3830
) but acpi=off helped in
that case. I wonder, when you tried acpi=off, did you power off your
box or just rebooted?
The big input update went in with 2.6.9-rc2-bk4. Could you please try
bk3 and bk4 to verify that this update is causing the problems or we
shoudl look elsewhere.
I am CCing Vojtech, maybe he has some ideas...
