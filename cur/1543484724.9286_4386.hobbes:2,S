I'd posted earlier that I could not change channels with 2.2.1, and the
bttv drivers compiled in.  I remade for bttv modules and loaded:
insmod i2c
insmod tuner type=6
insmod msp3400
insmod bttv card=3
Complied in is still broken.  Would it be possible to add args to
complied in drive from config?  It seems that it doesn't autosense the
tuner.
