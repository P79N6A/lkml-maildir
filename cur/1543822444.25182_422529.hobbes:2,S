Yes, which is why I measured that one as well.
Now, the original concern was that we have the five operations implemented
as multi-line macros and doing a hybrid solution doesn't really address
that.
Also, it's not quite clear to me what's the best way to turn three of
the five into functions, whether inline or not.
For measuring the sizes, I did the following:
add void ___restore_flags(unsigned long *x) with the implementation
and then:
#define __restore_flags(x) ___restore_flags(&(x))
Alternatively, would it make sense to change __restore_flags to take
a pointer to flags instead?  That would be quite an invasive change...
Any thoughts?
