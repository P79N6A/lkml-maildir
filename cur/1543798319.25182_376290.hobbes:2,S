I don't understand, what exactly would you like to see in the block
device's device directory?  With this patch, we correctly point back to
all of the different block devices controlled by this device.
I'm curious as to why kudzu even cares about this?
And, how does it handle things like mult-port serial devices, which have
all of the multiple class device symlinks in one single device
directory, just like this.
thanks,
