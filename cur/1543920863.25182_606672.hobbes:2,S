Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Fix two PEIe hotplug issues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix PCIe Hotplug so that it works with ExpressCard slots on Dell notebooks
(and others?) in conjunction with the modparam of pciehp_force=1.
The PCIe Hotplug driver has two issues when used on Dell notebooks
which lack ACPI BIOS support for PCIe hotplug:
1. The driver does not recognise cards that were inserted 
   prior to the driver being modprobe'd.
2. The driver stops functioning after a suspend/resume (RAM) cycle,
   and needs to be rmmod'd and modprobe'd to get it working again.
This patch series addresses those issues, resulting in a completely
functional PCIe Hotplug driver for Dell notebooks, and possibly others
as well which may lack ACPI BIOS support for this.
Note that pciehp_force=1 is (still) required.
There are three patches in this series:
	01_pciehp_handle_preinserted_card.patch
		-- fixes problem number 1 (above).
	02_pciehp_split_pcie_init.patch
		-- preparation for the resume patch.
	03_pciehp_resume_reinit_hardware.patch
		-- fixes problem number 2 (above).
diffstat summary for the three patches combined:
 drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp.h      |    3
 drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_core.c |   23 +++
 drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_ctrl.c |    2
 drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_hpc.c  |  185 +++++++++++++++-------------
