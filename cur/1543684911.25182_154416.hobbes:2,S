The setup you describe is exactly the reason why I suggested elsewhere (in a
private discussion) to single-link all directory entries pointing to the same
directory in a list. In case of deletion of the "main" entry, the "main" simply
can walk on to the next (former) hardlink, if there are any left the tree is
deleted completely. That's it.
