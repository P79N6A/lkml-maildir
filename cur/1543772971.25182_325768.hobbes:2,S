The ICH5 fix up needs to look something like this:
PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801EB_0 is the PCI ID for the LPC device.
ACPI_FIXUP(INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801EB_0, hpet_ich5_fixup)
hpet_ich5_fixup()
{
     pci_bios_find_device(PCI_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801EB_0, ...)
     pci_bios_read(device, GENERAL_CONTROL_REGISTER, ..)
     Check bit 17 and see if it is enabled
     use bit 15:16 to set hpet_address to one of the four addresses
}
It would be more complicated to try and turn it on if it is turned
off. Mine is turned on at boot even though it has no ACPI entry. A
routine like this should at least get things started.
