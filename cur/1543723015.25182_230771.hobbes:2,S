But the flag will not give you atomicity of resetting other fields, like
pktcount. I guess we can ensure it by carefully rearranging the states
and what is reset at what point but it is too fragile.
Would you accept a pair serio_rx_suspend/serio_rx_resume that would still
take the lock internally but not expose this fact to the driver?

Sysfs changes should be useable even without platform device changes
and I would like start syncing with you. Would you take patches 2 
through 10 (I will drop the legacy_position stuff)?
