This link file got changed to a directory, probable because your
new directory was copied! You should have used `tar`. Copy will
follow the sym-links and copy the underlying data, i.e., a whole
directory.
Not to worry. In your new Linux directory tree do:
cd include
mv asm /tmp	# or /usr/src, someplace temporary.
cd ..		# Back to Linux
cp .config ..	# Save your configuration
make mrproper	# Make like a distribution
cp ../.config . # Restore configuration
make oldconfig	# Re-do configuration
make dep	# Re-do dependencies
make bzImage	# Doit toit
After everything works, recursively delete the saved 'asm'
directory that was moved outside the kernel tree.
