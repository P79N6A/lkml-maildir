   And then the baseline kernel would turn around and redo all the
   internal interfaces, leaving Microsoft with a carefully crafted trap
   that *doesn't* *work* with current versions of the kernel.
   Things fall off the baseline kernel all the time because of kernel
   interfaces changing;  How long do you think that Microsoft would be
   willing to toss money down a deep hole just so they can piss off the
   US Government that little extra bit?

  Microsoft has, what, one application that runs on Linux, and about 10
  that run on Unix of any sort?   Even at full speed, they'd still take
  at least 6 months to turn around and release Office + the Windows
  desktop on a bog-standard Linux.  To add a fuck-you layer to the
  operating system would take a lot longer, because they'd have to
  write the f-y layer and THEN write their applications to it.

  david parsons \bi/ If you're objecting to the thought that Microsoft might
                 \/   make money off Linux applications, well, I suspect you
		       were out of luck after Linux got over 5% market share.
