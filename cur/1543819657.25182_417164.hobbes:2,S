It was just a suggestion, the bug might very well be just the size of
the transfer itself and nothing SG related. All I can say for sure is
that I'd be very surprised if this fs corruption isn't due to the
hardware mangling the data for large transfers.

Most likely a coincidence, try running eg dbench or other stress tests
on the fs with larger xfer size and I'm sure it'll corrupt eventually as
well.
