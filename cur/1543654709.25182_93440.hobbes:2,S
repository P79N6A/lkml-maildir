There were 2.0 releases until 2001, and three 2.2 releases this year
alone, I think you can assume that there will be releases for at least
another year.
Actually with all the problem reports and partial fixes for data loss on
journaling filesystems (or perhaps only ext3), I would expect another
release fairly soon.
Certainly if you submit a patch by the end of the year it would be soon
enough, although it still has to be accepted. I can't see any reason why
it wouldn't, although that doesn't mean much.
