Okay, so going to the exact problem case, the behaviour we require is:
SERIAL_8250	PCI	EMBEDDED	gives SERIAL_8250_PCI
	n	X	X		n
	X	n	X		n
	m	y	n		m
	y	y	n		y
	m	y	y		user selects 'm' or 'n'
	y	y	y		user selects 'y', 'm' or 'n'
the correct way to tell Kconfig to give us that is:
+config SERIAL_8250_PCI
+       tristate "8250/16550 PCI device support" if EMBEDDED
+       depends on SERIAL_8250 && PCI
+       default SERIAL_8250
+       help
+         This builds standard PCI serial support. You may be able to
+         disable this feature if you only need legacy serial support.
+         Saves about 9K.
