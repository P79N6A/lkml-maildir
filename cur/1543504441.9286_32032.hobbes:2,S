Unfortunately, this won't work so well...
The problem is that when a task receives a trap, it's not processed
immediately; instead, the task recieves the signal, and only when it is
scheduled to run again will the signal truly be processed.
Now, this puts us in a real bind when dealing with coredumps.  Between the
moment our misbhaving task got the fatal signal until the manager gets to
act on it, another thread may get a timeslice.  It may change data in our
VM, and so the core dump will simply not reflect the real situation.  
(And, if our fault was e.g. due to an incorrectly written synchronization
primitive, it's possible we faulted because a data structure was
corrupted--- and we now let the culprit cover its tracks before the
coredump... Ouch.)
[ Hmm...  This also means that even the _current_ situation is bad; if a
thread is hit by a fault, another thread may get some time to run before
this thread's coredump is produced! ]
So, we must create the coredump immediately when the fault is detected;
and this (IMO) means it must be done in the kernel, as we don't want to
implement some extremely complex inter-task messaging mechanism to make
sure the manager is the next task which will run.
To sum it up, it appears as if we'll have to use something like the patch
that was recently posted that will produce a real threaded coredump for
all tasks sharing the same mm, and possibly we'll also require a change in
the fault handing logic so that after a force_sig the same task will
_always_ go on running to handle the trap...
Lots of work, not enough time...
