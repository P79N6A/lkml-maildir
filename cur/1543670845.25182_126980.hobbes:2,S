As long as you are suporting or testing a small number of configurations,
say less than two, initrd buys not much. But using all modules allows you
to support a new config just by rebuilding initrd, vastly faster than
building a kernel on most machines. And for a vendor doing a distribution
it is a huge win.
Not to mention some drivers work differently when loaded as modules,
loading as modules allows control of the device scans, etc, etc. It's just
more flexible.
