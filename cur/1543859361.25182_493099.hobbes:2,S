To be precise, ohci1394 itself does suspend/resume now thanks to
Bernhard Kaindl's patch from September.  (Merged in 2.6.20-rc1.)  But
the mid layer and perhaps some of the high-level drivers need additional
support.  According to a report, ieee1394 does not restore the local
config ROM yet.  I will join working on this problem RSN.  I think these
issues are not particularly difficult to solve --- it is merely that the
few people who know the driver stack well enough didn't use suspend/
resume support on their own machines yet.
As for Kristian's stack, suspend/resume support can probably be added
quite easily, especially after I got the missing bits working in the
mainline stack.
