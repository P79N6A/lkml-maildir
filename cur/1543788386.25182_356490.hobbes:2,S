Extending the open intent with 'struct file *' in itself is pretty
lame.  How do you initilaize intent.open.file from within ->lookup and
->create?  Do you call dentry_open(), that doesn't cut it with the
reorganized filp_open() thing.  And anyway it would be rather ugly
that it would recurse into the filesystems ->open() method.
See the problems I have with the intent.open.file thing?

Yes, the problem is trying to fit too many things into this intent
thing.
But if you post a patch, that implements an equivalent (or wider)
interface to the open_create() method, only with intents, and it
doesn't get too convoluted, it's OK by me.
I tried to do that, but the ->open_create() interface just seemed
cleaner.
