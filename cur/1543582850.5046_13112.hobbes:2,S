Should not TCP advertise window of 0 to stop sender?
Where does kernel put all those data in tcp case? I do not understand
that. Transmiter blasts at 300Mbit, userspace gets 20Mbit. There's
280Mbit datastream going _somewhere_. It should be eating memory at
35MB/second, unless you have 1Gig of ram, something interesting should
happen after minute or so...
