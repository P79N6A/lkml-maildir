Andrea, I'm re-reading this and I'm guilty of misreading your 3G+512M, what
you meant is PAGE_OFFSET+512M.  Yes, in fact this is exactly what
config_nonlinear does.  Config_discontigmem does not do this, not without
your 'trivial map', and that's all config_nonlinear is: a trivial map done
in an organized way.  This same trivial mapping is capable of replacing all
known non-numa uses of config_discontigmem.
