hi ya alan
yuppers... 
those 320GB disks are not cheap?? but are floating around
- i use backups for "warm swap".... and dont care about it over time sorta
  thing ... need to be able to keep TBs of data online as fast as possible
  ( few minutes ) to restore a dead/hacked box..
- for "fast turn around"... tapes have always been dayz of effort to
  restore  and too much of a headache to keep the tapes and heads clean
  and test it more rigorously than having to test disks 
- you already implicitly trusts disks to hold your data .. till the disk
  dies ... hopefully due to ball bearing/lubricant/heat failure etc
fun stuff
have fun
