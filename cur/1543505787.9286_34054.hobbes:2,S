Nope. I wasn't talking about that - are you trying to say the winblows encrypts
data or something? - I can still snoop network packets as with any other machine -
that's what I meant. If I have a winblows/NT/Unix/whatever network using TCP/IP or
another other standard, by the sheer nature of standards (bear in mind that the net
is driven by standards so companies should *not* discriminate) I can snoop network
packets and read the data being transmitted (however, my machine is using 128bit
crypto - stronger than the UK M$ Internet Exploiter (did I mention IE 5 is 120Mb of
crap?) so even reading packets, my machine is *more* secure)..... etc...

Can do this on any machine with appropriate access. My cookie files are monitored,
the password wouldn't be around long enough unless it was snooped as I worked. I
don't run winblows and you'd need root access to perisopce to install a cracked
NS client.

Now that's utter crap. crap, crap and more crap. Linux is *more* secure because of
this. I guess the last major networking problem was with 2.2.x with the TCP
malformed packet thingy - how long did it take Alan to fix - 4 hours (M$ couldn't
ever achieve that - all that wonderful "QA" they do would take days to test it and
make the patch up to their increadably "high" standards :) - when was the last time
a M$ "service pack" came out ***4*** hours after the exploit? M$ has many more
problems than Linux since it is closed source. Open source can only be a good thing
- exploits are always being found with everything, but at least with Linux stuff is
fixed and fixed quickly. M$ can take months to fix problems. If you don't keep up
to date with the latest kernels, you are brain dead, it's hardly difficult to
download a patch now is it? Sorry, but M$ is no better in this area.

Yeah, but there are countless bugs in NT/winblows 9x which do similar stuff, and
the exploit was fixed almost as soon as it was discovered, so what's your
point/problem?

OK, but if you're a "newbie", you're hardly running the NSAs computer network,
I can honestly say thatmy computer holds no data of
importance/interest/significance to anyone else, so why would anyone really want to
crack their machine.??????

Only if the machine is worth cracking - Reading library has an extreamly insecure

Yes they are, since my system is more secure than any of my friends winblows
machines. Besides, I'm speaking to Trading Standards about Barclays, and we're
going to get them sorted/have their bodies horribly mutilated with griant brandings
of the words "we do not work for M$ and as such we have open minds and we love
Linux and all penguins out there" - side note : why can't I legally own a penguin -
I really want one :)

But still better than winblows and mac.
Sorry to find you missguided but I think most of what you've said is utter crap,
even blasphamous towards Linux.
Up with the penguins.
