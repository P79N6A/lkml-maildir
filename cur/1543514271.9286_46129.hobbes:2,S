If you think about it, you'll soon see that such isn't quite the case.
What I think you meant to say was that most of those states are highly
specific to the use of half duplex as opposed to full duplex, and I
have no problem agreeing with that.
However, the state as designed is basically generic to ANY half duplex
line discipline and, as a result, would be best implemented as a core
module for half duplex disciplines, with the individual disciplines
hooking into it.

True, and hence why I stated that the design was for generic half
duplex support, with the design aim being to be able to hang ANY half
duplex protocol off the design.

Very true.
Best wishes from Riley.
