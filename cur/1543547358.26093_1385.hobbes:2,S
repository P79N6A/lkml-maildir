That is presumably what your routing table says, that both are reachable via
the ethernet

probably the latter if the routing table for d.e.f.* is wrong

It doesnt look like a bug to me

I would say Linux is right to use a.b.c.* to talk to d.e.f.*
BSD/OS if it doesnt know where a.b.c.* is but has been told they are not local
is also doing the right thing
Fix your routing tables ?
