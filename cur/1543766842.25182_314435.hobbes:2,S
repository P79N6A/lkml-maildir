Correct.  I actually consider it two external barriers: the first after
the lockspace has been suspended, the second after lockspace recovery is
completed.

Typically it does if you're combining the dlm with something that requires
fencing (like a file system).  Fencing isn't relevant to the dlm itself,
though, since the dlm software isn't touching any storage.

That's right, it requires more intelligence on the part of the external
management system in userspace.

Interesting, and sounds correct.  I must admit that using the word "lock"
to describe these CRM-level inter-dependent objects is new to me.
