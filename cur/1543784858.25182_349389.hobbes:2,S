That's likely the unnamed RAID controller with the broken firmware refered to 
below (they might actually have fixed the firmware now) But for block
devices it's not really needed anyways. From my experience and those
of other folks (IA64) the 4GB zone + a small fallback zone is a good 
compromise.

Because that would likely either impact the page allocation fast path
by having unsuited data structures for the normal case or make the code to 
allocate pages with arbitary boundaries really slow because the allocation
wouldn't be O(1). Didn't seem like a good tradeoff.
