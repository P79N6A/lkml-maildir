I'm one of the users biten by this change, and I can undestand your reason; 
anyway from my standpoint the situation is that a change that has no 
technical motivation (at least to my knowledge) is going to remove an 
interface that until now was available, and prevents me to use my card with 
new kernels; this is too similar to some closed souce companies behaviour. No 
big deal, I can live with that, but if this is the right way to handle that 
interface, why this is enforced only now and not from the very first time? 
Granted that you have all the rights to do that, may I ask if this is not in 
contrast with is stated in this post?

I understand all your motivation,and I agree with most of them, but I'm asking 
if this is the right way to handle this GPL issue...
