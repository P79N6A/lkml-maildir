Let's hold off on this for now...  we can commit this patch anytime, and 
there is no harm in being "unofficial maintainer" for a while.

I'd like to wait until my netdev-2.6 changes (just pushed to their 
public BK home, bk://gkernel.bkbits.net/netdev-2.6) are pulled by 
Andrew, and incorporated into the update of his -mm tree.
This patch will likely need some rediffing.

Also I applied the sis900-detach found on the web page.
