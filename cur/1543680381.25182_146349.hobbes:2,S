Hello Chris,
I tried to produce some useful output but failed. Additionals I found:
- pre3-ac1 has the same problem
- the box _hangs_ in fact, no sysrq is working.
  (you need hw-reset to revive the box)
- I can see no disk activity on the 3ware RAID in question
- It always shows up, completely reproducable
- It shows during boot and during single- or multiuser (mount from console)
Regards,
Stephan
