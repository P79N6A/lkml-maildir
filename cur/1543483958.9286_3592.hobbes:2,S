First, x11amp is FPU intensive (isn't it?) and, given enough RAM, compilation
is CPU bound.  Or you might not have enough RAM on the K6, or you might
have not enough RAM for 2 compilations + x11amp on either machine but a
slower disk on the K6.
It might be the 256k of full-speed L2 cache on your PPro that's making
the difference, but somehow I don't think so.

I think your choice of load impacts the two processors differently, and
happens to impact the old processor less.
