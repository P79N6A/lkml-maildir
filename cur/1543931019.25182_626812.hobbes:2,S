Hi,
I finally solved this.
There is no need to revert 2b1e300a9dfc3196ccddf6f1d74b91b7af55e416.
It was actually a deadly mixture of 3 bugs:
1) Stale handles - Trond's patch fixes it, but I somehow missed it.
2) Empty /proc/fs/nfsd (which causes nfs4 failures, and masks the bug #1, since with it the subfolders are just empty)
	[PATCH 2.6.24-rc4] proc: Remove/Fix proc generic d_revalidate fixes it
3) And as I expected, a userspace bug, which believe me or not has exactly the same symptoms
like #2 (and doesn't depend on others)
It is a wrong boot script in BLFS that starts nfs daemons in wrong order.
So there are 3 bugs and each masks the former one :-) .
I revised boot script to use recommended order like in nfs-utils.
And finally everything works....
Best regards,
