Hi,
is there any reason to allow compilation of mptctl.o (CONFIG_FUSION_CTL)
only as a module?
drivers/message/fusion/Config.in:
  if [ "$CONFIG_MODULES" = "y" ]; then
    [...]
    dep_tristate "  Fusion MPT misc device (ioctl) driver" CONFIG_FUSION_CTL $CONFIG_FUSION m
  fi
I tried to compile it in and it works. I'd like to have static kernel
without modules, but need mptctl :-(

I'm glad that Emacs is bigger and more open than some of the people who use
it.
