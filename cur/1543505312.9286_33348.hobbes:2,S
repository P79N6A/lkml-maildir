Disassemble.  The patch doesn't change any code, it just fixes the code
to use consistent syntax instead of misleading syntax.  That you thought
otherwise proves the point :-)
In "movl %ax,%ds" the 16 bit register is overriden by the "l" suffix, so
Gas chooses the 32 bit form anyway.
So I vote for including the patch.
