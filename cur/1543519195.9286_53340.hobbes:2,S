How about just having the kernel generate a random key at boottime, and using
some cryptographic alg. that allow easy seeking, encrypt all that is written
/ read to the swapfile. It would give a slight performance hit, but shouldn't
be too difficult to implement. The key should ofcourse (like all kernel mem)
never be swapped out.
