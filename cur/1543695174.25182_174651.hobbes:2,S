I've been trying the new suspend to disk implementation (pmdisk, I
think) lately.  I get these lines in the kernel log when starting
after a suspend:
PM: Reading pmdisk image.
PM: Resume from disk failed.
ACPI: (supports S0 S1 S3 S4 S5)
Last time I tried swsusp, I did pass the resume= option, but it didn't
work.
Could it be that some disk cache is never flushed properly?
Occasionally, some random filesystem is reported as not being cleanly
unmounted when booting normally, which seems to point in the same
direction.
