Right. Well, my concept was that that "in"-ness is just a relationship
between two process families, so treat it relationally and not
heirarchically. So, to the kernel, they've all got global unique IDs,
but to the actual userspace within those families, they might see
something different. And the model still supports containers in containers.

Well, let's cross those bridges when we come to them. I agree it should
only be implemented if required for individual numbers. PIDs and process
family IDs seem logical to me, at this point anyway.
