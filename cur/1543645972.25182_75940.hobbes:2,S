This is nice, because if you are doing "make -j[n]" you currently get
dumped into the wrong file (or just some non-existent file in the wrong
directory) on build warnings and errors (when compiling under vim/emacs)
because e.g. the "make[1]: entering directory fs/ext3" message was
followed by "make[1]: entering directory fs/msdos", while still
compiling files in fs/ext3.
Granted, this isn't a great reason to change, but it bugs me every
day.
Cheers, Andreas
