Hi.
I need the following to avoid the following errors when trying to build
the latest BK-Kernel ...
drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x2dfb): In function `isapnp_init':
: undefined reference to `isapnp_card_protocol'
drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x2e04): In function `isapnp_init':
: undefined reference to `isapnp_card_protocol'
drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x2e76): In function `isapnp_init':
: undefined reference to `isapnp_card_protocol'
The "isapnp_card_protocol" structure was removed in revision 1.25 of
core.c, but it's usage was readded in revision 1.27. The command
"bk revtool drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c"
will show this.
There is also difference between rev 1.25.1.1 and 1.28 with using
subsys_initcall() -vs- device_initcall(). I don't know which should be
used.
