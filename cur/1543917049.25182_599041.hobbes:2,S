My, my, you can be unpleasant when you try.  There's no need for it.  As 
it happens I have years of UNIX experience on you.  (Newbie!)
You've got an idea that the original intention was for there to be a way 
to escape from a chroot, but that the documentation was written so that, 
not only was this not mentioned, but what was written implies 
otherwise.  You've also got some idea that because it's the way it is, 
therefore it must be right.  You present no reasoning to explain why the 
behavior is correct; instead you use insults.  I've exhausted my 
tolerance for rudeness.
