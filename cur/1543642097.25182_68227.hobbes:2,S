I think you missed one. Anton explained in detail what NTFS would have
to do to write a single byte if _nothing_ was cached on the client. I
think it failed to mention that the whole operation would have to be
executed with a lock - so mouch for distributed operation.

Remember that append causes metadata updates, so the only thing you can
do without worrying about the speed of metadata updates is read/rewrite.
(assuming you hack the filesystems to turn of timestamp-updates)
And even those operations are highly dependent on "metadata operations"
- they need metadata to know where to read/rewrite. Again, read Antons
post about this.

Currently there is no volume-manager with cluster support on linux
(unless Veritas has one?), but both Sistina and IBM are working on it
for LVM2 and EVMS - I'm sure patches will be accepted to speed up the
process.

Are you refering to that some filesystems can handle certain workloads
better than others? E.g. reiserfs is really fast for manipulating
directory-structures, adding new files or removing old ones? But didn't
you say that all you cared about was read and rewrite? That all other
filesystem-operations were so rare that nobody would notice?
In addition to this beeing technically impossible (to create a _working_
solution) I think the motivation is seriously flawed. The "solution"
you're proposing wouldn't be suitable for any viable problem.
