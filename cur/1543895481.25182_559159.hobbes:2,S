With performance like that, it sounds like you're saturating a bus 
somewhere along the line.  If you're using scsi, for instance, it's very 
easy for a long chain of drives to overwhelm a channel.  You might also 
want to consider some other RAID layouts like 1+0 or 5+0 depending upon 
your space vs. reliability needs.
