Hello,
i dont understand the current argument so would prefere not to enter it. 
But it triggered my curiosity about current loop-aes security.
3 years ago i published a paper describing how an attacker would be able 
to modify the content of the encrypted device without being detected.

i was just curious about the current state of loop-aes. Is it still 
vulnerable to this attack ?
