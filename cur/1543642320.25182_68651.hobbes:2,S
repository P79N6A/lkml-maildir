this happens every time i run test6 on 2.5.32 or 2.5.33.  the pages
are not on the LRU, and are not locked, when the NFS client calls
invalidate_inode_pages.
how do these pages get into the page cache?  answer:
nfs_readdir_filler is invoked by read_cache_page to fill a page.
when nfs_readdir_filler is invoked in 2.5.31, the page count on the
page to be filled is always 2.  when nfs_readdir_filler is invoked
in 2.5.32+, the page count is very often 3, but occasionally it is 2.
