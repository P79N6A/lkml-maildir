Hello,
Not sure who to direct this to.  I've been trying to get acpi s3 to work
on my pentium M laptop (tecra m2).  Without the nvidia driver loaded, I
can echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep and the machine does indeed suspend (power
light throbs and all).  However, when I try to wake up the thing, it
would flash the bios screen and throw me back to grub.
I've been investigating the code at arch/i386/kernel/acpi/wakeup.S, and
have discovered that if I place a busy wait directory before the ljmpl
to wakeup_pmode_return, that I indeed do see 'Lin' on the screen instead
of the bios screen.
The joke is, if I place a busy wait first thing after the
wakeup_pmode_return label, it never gets executed and I get a regular boot.
It would appear as though the jump from 16bit code into the 32bit code
is failing and the bios is kicking in with a regular startup.
Anybody have any suggestions?
