We really want to avoid doing such stuff in-kernel if at all possible, of
course.
Is it not possible to implement the fork/exec/exit notifications to
userspace so that a daemon can track the process relationships and perform
aggregation based upon individual tasks' accounting?  That's what one of
the accounting systems is proposing doing, I believe.
(In fact, why do we even need the notifications?  /bin/ps can work this
stuff out).
