Thanks for doin this!
However, the function dock_event(...) still contains this comment:
	/*
	 * we don't do events until someone tells me that
	 * they would like to have them.
	 */
Well, I like to have them ;-)
The sysfs exports are more or less useless without events. When the dock
driver is loaded, you get a platform device below /sys. But you never know
if there will ever be a docking station connected to your
system. Userspace caring about this will have to poll the 'docked' file,
which is obviously bad.
Thanks,
