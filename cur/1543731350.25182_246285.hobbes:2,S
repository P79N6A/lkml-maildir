I see a 3X drop in thruput, ouch, when I substitute ub.ko for
usb-storage.ko.
Specifically I get 0.5 GB/min from ub.ko, as contrasted with 1.5 GB/min
from usb-storage.ko, in the outside 1 GiB of a particular disc, in three
or more consistent consecutive samples from each.
I knew how to patch to allow bytes/LBA != 512 only because of your
recent answers in [usb-storage].  I took my samples from
linux-2.6.9-rc1-bk2, modprobe'ing .ko built with and without
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB.

Yes please.
Even DVD-RAM need the ioctl's to pass thru SCSI, for everything
vendor-specific that lies beyond generic read and write.
