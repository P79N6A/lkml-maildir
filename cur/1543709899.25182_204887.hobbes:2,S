This is no reason for not using the DSO form.  The userlevel code finds
the vDSO via the auxiliary vector.  By passing up different values for
32 and 64 bit processes you easily handle the last problem.
Many functions are no real issue either.  It not inefficient to use the
symbol table.
The only issue is that the vDSO should (IMO must) be position
independent.  You certainly want to map the same copy in each address
space.  This means the symbol table cannot contain addresses, only offsets.

This means adding a multiplexer in the vDSO while the caller knows
exactly which function is wanted.  Sure, it's possible and quite easy to
implement.
If you want it more complicated you could do it as I suggested for x86.
 Add absolute symbols to the symbol table, have the libc use the dlsym()
equivalent to determine whether the symbol is defined.  If it is, it'll
return an offset which then can be used for the jump.  ppc64 function
descriptors can certainly be handled.
The results of the dlsym() calls would be cached so that it only happens
once for each symbol.  And since the soname of the vdso is known, one
doesn't even have to look in the global scope but instead directly in
the vdso's symbol table.
This all would definitely need changes in libc and ld.so.  But I guess
it'll work.

That's easily doable with a real DSO.

Why lack?  As a real DSO the vDSO can use the normal unwind info
handling userlevel DSOs use, too.  I do not see a reason which this
cannot work.  The unwind info for DSOs is position-independent so it
should work just fine.
