True, it isn't ESSENTIAL to have swap. Having swap space does, however,
enable more efficient usage of your physical RAM (little-used data can be
paged out, saving physical RAM without any performance degradation.) It
also gives a very cheap safety marging against OOM problems - rather than
getting hard failures as soon as physical RAM is exhausted, you get
(recoverable) disk thrashing, and can still log in to fix things.
So you're right, swap is not essential - just very useful in most
circumstances.
