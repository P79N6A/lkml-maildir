Hmmm. That is strange indeed and would mean that one of the initial caches 
has not correctly been initialized or we are using a smaller cache size 
than the management caches. With your patch the system fell 
back to a larger size slab (which seems to be present). Weird.
What is your setting for L1_CACHE_BYTES?
