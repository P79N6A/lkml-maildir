Release 1.8.6: Wed Nov 14 16:58:03 EST 2001
	* Fixed three logic bugs reported by Frederic Gobry, David Kamholz,
	  and Danni Junglas.  These mainly affected rollback when a variable 
	  is unset; sometimes this wasn't being done properly.
This release resolves all known logic bugs and rulebase problems.  The
only things left on the to-do list are convenience features and some minor
improvements in the test/coverage tools.  This code is now officially ready for
the 2.5 fork.
Special thanks go to David Kamholz and David Relson, both of whom have turned
in particularly high-quality bug reports recently.  With collaborators like
these, debugging is almost a pleasure!
