There is no other information needed. By use atapi write support i mean 
Get it to do anything besides error out reporting that it cant access 
the drive. If you can query the drive much less actually write anything 
to it using the ATAPI interface than that's more than i've been able to do.
for example   cdrecord dev=ATAPI:1,0,0 checkdisk
1,0,0 should conform to secondary channel master as this is how devfs 
sets the cdr up too.
kernel version, if you look above it's 2.6, but for the sake of 
comparison, test4 or test5 with or without mm patches.
cdrecord version: atapi support was introduced with 2.0 but again, for 
the sake of comparison, anything after a13.
