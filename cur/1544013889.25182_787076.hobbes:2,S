In which case atomic_inc_unless is defined to provide a barrier.

It doesn't need that because the last level pointers in the radix
tree are not necessarily under RCU, but whatever synchronisation
the caller uses (in this case, speculative page references, which
should not require smp_read_barrier_depends, AFAIKS). Putting an
rcu_dereference there might work, but I think it misses a subtlety
of this code.

When that fails, the caller can (almost) assume the pointer has changed.
So it has to load the new pointer to continue. The object pointed to is
not protected with RCU, nor is there a requirement to see a specific
load execution ordering.
