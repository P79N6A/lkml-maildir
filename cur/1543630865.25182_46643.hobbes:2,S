That's what I do now.

This is already being done. But I do REALLY paranoid checking of
each and every parameter of every function that is not declared 'static'.
But in this case the caller of the function or the hardware is
doing really strange things and it should be fixed ASAP and this
is the best way to catch the caller ;-)
