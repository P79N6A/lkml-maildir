If you agree that the kernel keyring is the best place, it shouldn't be 
a big step to also agree that in-kernel signing is "good" since it 
allows you to use the key while it makes it possible for the kernel to 
refuse to divulge the private part...even to the user who added the key 
(i.e. yourself)...

How do you use a "time-limited proxy in the daemon" for your own 
keys/cerificates (e.g. ssh keys)?
