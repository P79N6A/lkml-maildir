Subject: 2.2.0p6: kswapd zombie!? [reproducible]

Hi,
I was basically stress-testing 2.2.0p6, and things were, er, getting a bit
out of control so I issued "kill -9 -1" as root. This killed off the
rampant processes alright, but kswapd became a zombie!
This reproduces.
I'm not sure if kswapd's ability to function is impaired, but I thought I
had better report it.
Cheers
Chris
