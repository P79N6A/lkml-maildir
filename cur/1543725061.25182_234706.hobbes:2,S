The problem is with the video driver (Via CastleRock integrated,
AGP4x).  By dragging certain windows around slowly in X, I can reliably
cause interrupts to be completely disabled for tens of milliseconds.
There was an issue several years ago where Matrox figured out they could
get slightly better benchmark scores by not checking whether a FIFO on
the video card was full before writing to it, which would cause the PCI
bus to completely freeze until the FIFO had drained.  Lots of vendors
followed suit until one of the audio software vendors figred it out and
called them on it, at which point they fixed their drivers.  The effects
(massive audio drouputs) and the steps to reproduce (drag a window
around the screen slowly) were identical.
I will contact the maintainer.
