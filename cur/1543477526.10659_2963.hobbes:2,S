Note that this should be much less of a problem with the current swapout
strategies, but yes, basically we definitely do want to have _some_ way of
maintaining a sane "maximum number of pages in flight" thing. 
The right solution may be to do the check in some other place, rather than
fairly deep inside the swap logic. 
It's not a big deal, I suspect.
Anyway, there's a real pre7 out there now, and it doesn't change a lot of
th issues discussed here. I wanted to get something stable and working. I
still need to get the recursive semaphore thing (or other approach) done,
but basically I think we're at 2.2.0 already apart from that issue, and
that we can continue this discussion as a "occasional tweaks" thing.
