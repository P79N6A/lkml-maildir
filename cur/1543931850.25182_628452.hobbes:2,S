OK that almost certainly means that we have a leak of TCPv6
objects which would then cause a leak of dst objects.
So you need to track down why TCPv6 isn't getting cleaned up.
First check the obvious, do you have any process(es) that are
hoarding TCPv6 sockets?
If not do you see a growing list of dead sockets in netstat?
Cheers,
