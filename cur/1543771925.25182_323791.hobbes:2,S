Guess I'm the only person insane enough to try and build a DSL router 
based on 2.6 with ancient SCSI disks on an ISA controller, but I just 
can't live without some of the features anymore which 2.4 still lacks.
In the meantime, I worked around the Oops by using a tiny disk on the 
onboard IDE controller, but I wouldn't quite call removing the card a 
fix for the problem.
The thing is, I have no real experience in C programming, although I 
sometimes read a little kernel source code and stuff. Right now I have a 
bit of trouble with my studies, but once that's settled I can do some 
reading about SCSI, Linux, the works. Doesn't seem to be anyone using 
2.6 with Future Domain cards anyway, so I'm not in a hurry. But just for 
completeness, it would be nice to have that driver cleaned up. It's in 
Linux' tree, after all. I'll build a testing box with ISA bus some time 
soon and try some debugging.
Thanks for your time : )
