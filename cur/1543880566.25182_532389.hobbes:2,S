cool idea - i have just tried this and it rocks - you can easily see the 
'nature' of CPU time distribution just via visual feedback. (Is there 
any easy way to start up 12 glxgears fully aligned, or does one always 
have to mouse around to get them into proper position?)
btw., i am using another method to quickly judge X's behavior: i started 
the 'snowflakes' plugin in Beryl on Fedora 7, which puts a nice smooth 
opengl-rendered snow fall on the desktop background. That gives me an 
idea about how well X is scheduling under various workloads, without 
having to instrument it explicitly.
