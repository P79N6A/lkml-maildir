Actually 3-way merge is not that bad. It's definitely better than ClearCase's
merge (I always fall back to RCS merge if ClearCase cannot resolve a merge
automatically).

I guess 3-way merge got a bad name because CVS always uses the branch point as
the parent, which fails miserably for any but the first merge after the branch.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
