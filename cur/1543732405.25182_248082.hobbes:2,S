I do not think you'd want this. How would you tell grep obscure label
without entering archives, then?

Well, you can... or at least I had version somewhere that
automagically prepended /overlay when file was not found. That way,
normal requests were fast and uservfs were used whenever it was
needed... At the price of little uglyness and slowing down -ENOENTs.

Yep, something less hacky would be nice.

If the userspace daemon is synchronously notified of file
modification... will not that lead to very ugly deadlocks?
