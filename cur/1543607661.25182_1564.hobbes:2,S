Hi,
I am running 2.4.14-pre3 patched with LVM 1.01rc4 and the vfs locking patch
for 2.4.11 and above.  I performed the following actions after which umount
fails.
mount /back
cd /back
ran a backup which filled the reiserfs on lvm /back fs.
cd ..
umount /back
and the umount tells me /back is busy.  Why? Does anyone 
else see this behavior?  With straight 2.4.14-pre3?
TIA,
Ed Tomlinson (off to sleep now)
