Steve said me now that arca-vm-19 way of checking the swap cache size is
working well (he did a mistake testing it two days ago). So I'll return to
it since it was the most stable/autotuning here.

No, it' s not the right thing to do. We may want to free a page in the
file cache instead of a buffer for example. Wait a bit. I am reverting to
the arca-vm-19 algorithm, then I'll sent you a new patch to try out.
