I think btree's would speed up dir operations, however it is
still a combo userland/kernel problem.  Poorly designed apps
using poorly designed directory structures should be rethought
and reprogrammed to do it in a more efficient manner
period.  Then it will run much faster on existing kernels, and
even more so if btree's are used.
A lot of OS's suffer from this problem, so it isn't just a Linux
issue.
