Absolutely, but the TLAN parts are usually quite alike. Even when the EISA
support was added, only the probing was changed to accomodate those cards.
I remember trying the TLAN's on an alpha a few years ago, and IIRC the 64bit
support was lacking badly. I know some of this has been changed in the 2.6
version of the driver, but it may not work very well since so few people use
this combination.
Thanks,
