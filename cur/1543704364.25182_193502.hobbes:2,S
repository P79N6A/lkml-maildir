Ok, as advised I'm reporting what happened to my system:
I run Kernel 2.6.1 with XFS on a laptop, I forgot to send it to "sleep"
and battery died, so there was unclean unmount (This is, what I believe 
was the cause),
at some point after I restarted my system many of the files couldn't be 
executed:
"binary file can't be executed reported", However the system was 
functional and I could boot it.
So I hexopened some of the problematic files and found that although 
the size of the file is maintained, there was no data, every byte was 
replaced by 0, I guess it was lucking reference on a hard drive or 
maybe something else. The reason I think the root of the problem is 
filesystem + kernel because the "corrupted" files have nothing in 
common, e.g:
/usr/bin/file
/etc/init.d/cron
/usr/bin/lynx
and that only happened when I updated kernel to 2.6.1
