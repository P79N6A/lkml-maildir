my personal preference would actually be to just never enable
interrupts. It's the fastest solution obviously, the most friendly on
stack and.. well simplest. Drivers no longer need to play some of the
games that they do today. And while there is an argument that this may
introduce a bit of latency... I'm not really convinced. The real work if
it's really heavy is supposed to happen in not-hard-irq context anyway,
and for all other cases interrupting the original handler is very likely
the most expensive thing in terms of adding latency to the system.
If I remember correctly there have been a few fedora releases which did
this, with no bad behavior.. I don't know if Fedora still does this.
