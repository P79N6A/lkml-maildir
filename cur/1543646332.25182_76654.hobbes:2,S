Thanks for the link - that describes the newer, per-cpu extensions to 
slab. Quite similar to the Linux implementation.
The text also contains a link to the original paper:
http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/bos94/bonwick.html
Bonwick used one partially sorted list [as linux in 2.2, and 2.4.<10], 
instead of seperate lists - move tail was not an option.
The new paper contains one interesting comment:
<<<<<<<
An object cache's CPU layer contains per-CPU state that must be 
protected either by per-CPU locking or by disabling interrupts. We 
selected per-CPU locking for several reasons:
[...]
  x    Performance. On most modern processors, grabbing an uncontended 
lock is cheaper than modifying the processor interrupt level.
<<<<<<<<
Which cpus have slow local_irq_disable() implementations? At least for 
my Duron, this doesn't seem to be the case [~ 4 cpu cycles for cli]
