Marko/Dalton/Unfortunate person searching for working DPT drivers,
I too once felt your pain.
Searched far and wide, etc.
But then I stumbled upon 
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mantel/next/
Which has patches for everything you could ever want, all integrated, if 
you choose them to be.
Anyway, inside those .tgz's was version 2.0 of the DPT I2O drivers.
I've separated them from the .tgz, and stuck them up here:
Kernel 2.2.18:
http://aurore.net/source/dpt_i2o-2.0-2.2.18.gz
Kernel 2.4.2
http://aurore.net/source/dpt_i2o-2.0-2.4.2.gz
Try 'em! :-) Not sure how they compare to Markos' version.
I exchanged my ASR2100S for a Mylex AcceleRAID 170 - because DAC960 support 
is so much better ;-) and I loved reading through the DAC960 sources - so 
clean and easy to understand!
Regards,
Omar Kilani
