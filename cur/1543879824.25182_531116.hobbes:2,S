Hello,
netconsole is hanging my box during IDE init.
I am running 2.6.20.7, config is attached from /proc
Without using netconsole the kernel boots fine. I am writing this message from it. 
When I do enable net-console I get from the linux banner to a couple of lines after
"sanitize end" on the logging client ( Mac OS X 10.4 , simple nc listener )
The boot continues until hde (handled by the HPT366 driver, hdg is the last drive )
and then the kernel just hangs.
Also two previous mails to lkml have disappeared. Debugging is getting really hard
when it is unbounded recursion :)
Cheers,
Mike Mattie
