It's now spelled:
       set_restore_sigmask();
For the other syscalls that depend on this (e.g. sys_ppoll),
we just put the whole definition in #ifdef HAVE_SET_RESTORE_SIGMASK.
The few machines that don't have RESTORE_SIGMASK support of some flavor,
also have not assigned numbers to the syscalls that need it.
Thanks,
Roland
