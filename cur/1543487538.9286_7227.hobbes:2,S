Sorry - I did edit a little too much I guess.  But your definition
wasn't really right either, IMHO.  See below...

I think we're on different wavelengths: "realtime" does have a meaning
outside any definition you choose for it.  I'm used to a particular
definition for "realtime", and of course if we use yours then my
comments are meaningless.

I totally disagree.  This is not what the rest of the planet means by
realtime.  I can define a realtime OS which must respond to events while
they are current but this does NOT preclude having multiple events
simultaneously - unless "current" is defined rather narrowly.  
I agree that an 8088 could run a RT OS, no problems.  I don't think that
you can formally prove that CP/M and BASIC will work though.

But how can you promise the customer that your system will respond to
events while they are current if you DON'T control the latency?
This is the crux.
