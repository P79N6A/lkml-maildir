The issue you describe only occurs when a new dependency on X86 is 
added. It is not a problem for the common case that a driver is portable 
and therefore available on all architectures.
If the driver also works on X86_64, adding a " || X86_64" is trivial.
In the worst case, a new driver is not available on X86_64 until this is 
added to the dependencies.
But the current setup might cause real bugs.
If one new user of CONFIG_LBD wouldn't additionally (and not strictly 
required) check BITS_PER_LONG, it might currently have unwanted effects 
on X86_64. Explicite annotations with X86_64 if it works on this 
architecture would prevent such bugs.
