After i recieved an email from Peter T. who had the same problem, but
_not_ under 2.4.9 i re-checked, and indeed, the problems dont appear in
kernel versions =< 2.4.9. So in either 2.4.10 or 2.4.11 the memory
leakage was 'introduced'.
My current preminition is that it could be the software raid layer thats
causing the leakage, but it also could be a combination of factors. (see
prev email to Peter T / lkml about the common factors in the 2
situations). On the other hand, i'm willing to try anything ;-)
