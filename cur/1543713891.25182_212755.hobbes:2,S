I think there are 2 major cases:
- A big hugepage-using program creates threads to take advantage
  of all of the CPUs => use clone2(...CLONEVM...), it works today.
- Another big hugepage-using program calling a little shell function
  with system() => just skip the VMA of the huge page area in
	do_fork():
		copy_process():
			copy_mm():
				dup_mmap()
  The child will have no copy of the huge page area. No problem, it will
  exec() soon, and the stack, the usual data, the malloc()'ed data, etc.
  are not in the huge page area => exec() will will work correctly.
I do not think we need a COW of the huge pages.
