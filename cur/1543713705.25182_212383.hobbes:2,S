Hand wavy.
Memory size is not necessarily predictive of optimal hash size;
certain embedded workloads may want huge TCP hashes but
render farms may only need a few dozen dentries. Why not
just start small and rehash when chains get too long (or too short)?
That gives better cache behavior _and_ memory usage at the
expensive of increased latency during rehash. Maybe that's OK?

rbtrees have different performance characteristics than a hash, and
hashing seems pretty optimal in the places it's currently used.
But, I'd love to be wrong if it means a faster kernel.
