Great!

Depends on your system. If C2/C3 or cpufreq state changes are detected,
we mark the tsc as unstable. 
It sounds as if from your earlier email the TSC works fine, so we might
want to look at what's making the system think its not ok. I probably
need to add a message as to why it was disqualified. However, that's a
separate issue from the last patch.
Thanks for the testing!
