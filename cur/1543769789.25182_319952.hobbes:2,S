I've asked Russell not to do it, but the fact is, he's worried about legal 
issues, and while I've also tried to resolve those (by having the OSDL 
lawyer try to contact some lawyers in the UK), that hasn't been clarified 
yet.
So either rmk needs to stop worrying about UK legal issues (the law itself 
sounds fine, but the stupidity is in potential interpretations of it, and 
I'm hoping we can get a statement saying that such an interpretation is 
not actually valid), or rmk would need to special-case you and others that 
explicitly ask him not to mangle sign-offs.
Now, having myself aggressively automated a lot of what I do just to be 
able to keep up, I have to admit that I understand rmk's objections to 
special-casing certain email addresses very well. It tends to just not be 
worth the pain.
So for now, it looks like we either have to make sure that rmk is 
comfortable with not editing sign-off's (working on it, but I can't 
guarantee anything), or that you're ok with getting the email stripped, 
_or_ you will end up having to send patches directly to me rather than to 
rmk (and face the chaos and bumbling that is Linus).
