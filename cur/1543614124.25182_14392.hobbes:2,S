Hi
Could someone explain me why the kernel daemons (ksoftirqd that exists one
per CPU and each kernel thread has affinity to a single CPU) run with very
low priority?
mdrecovery etc run at very high priority (nice -20) but these softirq
daemons that run all the tasklet processing run as very low priority
threads.
is there a specific reason for this?
thanks
ashokr
