Following my fading memory here, but....
What file system are you sharing?  VFAT by chance?  For some reason
this sounds vaguely like a truncate bug Tridge fixed a few monthds
back.  Try 2.2.2 (released over the weekend).
If you are exporting a VFAT fs, try to reproduce the same behavior
using ext2.
