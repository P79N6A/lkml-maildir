Hi,
	I was wondering if it is possible to execute a userspace application from 
within the kernel (particularly binfmt_elf.c)...
something along the lines of execl()...
If so, what is the name of the function used to do this?
*an aside: It would be very useful for newbies like myself to have a list 
of functions that can be used in the kernel.... Does this exist at all?
Thanks very much for your time....Could you please reply to my address as I 
am not subscribed to the list.
