Your device does not need any initialization done by userspace, does
it? How widespread is this device? inputattach has "--dump" option
which sets up a SERIO_RS232/0/0/0 serio port. You could mark your
serio driver as manual bind driver and bind it trhough sysfs (echo -n
"taos-evm" /sys/device/serio/devices/serioX/drvctl to bind it).
