It's not 'wrong' in terms of correctness it's simply too restrictive for
no reason. I agree that we should check for the tasklist lock only.

yeah, it's just as good of a check.

good.

yep - please send a new patch to Andrew.

i'd just skip filling out that statistics field - like my minimal patch
does.
