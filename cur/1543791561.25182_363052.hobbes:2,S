hm, why not start with the -1 value for PCI_NO_IRQ, instead of 0:

and be done with it.

we shouldnt make it overridable just for the sake of it. If all arches 
were fine with -1, it should be the generic value and there's no 
override.
plus, shouldnt this go into -mm first, since it clearly affects some 
drivers? Why into Linus' tree immediately?
the patch series looks good to me otherwise.
