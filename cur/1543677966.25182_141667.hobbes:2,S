Have you read "NVIDIA Accelerated Linux Driver Set README & Installation 
Guide"?
Try to add this option to the Section "Device" of your XF86Config-4 file:
Option "NvAgp" "0"
AND READ THIS:
(app-f) APPENDIX F: CONFIGURING AGP
__________________________________________________________________________
There are several choices for configuring the NVIDIA kernel module's
use of AGP: you can choose to either use NVIDIA's AGP module (NVAGP),
or the AGP module that comes with the linux kernel (AGPGART).  This is
controlled through the "NvAGP" option in your XF86Config file:
         Option "NvAgp" "0"  ... disables AGP support
         Option "NvAgp" "1"  ... use NVAGP, if possible
         Option "NvAgp" "2"  ... use AGPGART, if possible
         Option "NvAGP" "3"  ... try AGPGART; if that fails, try NVAGP
