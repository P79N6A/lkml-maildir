This only occurs because the problematical functions (eg,
pci_update_resource) probably aren't called on 64-bit machines - if
they were, they'd zero the upper 32-bits.  Maybe 64-bit machines are
happy with that anyway?
Rather than reimplementing the internals of pci_update_resource() it
may be worth splitting the common stuff out so it gets fixed for both
pci_update_resource() and pci_enable_device().
