Can anyone tell me about the viability of a guarantee_memory() syscall?
[I'm thinking: it would either kill the process, or allocate all virtual
memory needed for its shared libraries, buffers, allocated memory, etc.
Furthermore, it would render this process immune to the OOM killer,
unless it allocated further memory.]
Thanks,
