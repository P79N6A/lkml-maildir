Hi Andrew,
Thank you for your -mm1 patch to 2.6.2-rc2, I've now got my system up
and running again.  I'm not sure where the problem was, since I didn't
find the problem point after sprinkling a bunch of AAA(); debugging
printks() all over the stuff in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c and some
other files in there as well.  
Would it make sense for me to try and work backwards from the -mm1 and
see which patch(es) makes the difference?  
One thing I notice is that now my interrupts are all on just one
processor:
   > cat /proc/interrupts            CPU0       CPU1       
     0:   59000197         20    IO-APIC-edge  timer
     1:       1867          1    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
     2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
     8:          3          1    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
    11:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  Cyclom-Y
    12:        703          1    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
    14:        281          0    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
    16:      42762          3   IO-APIC-level  ide2, ide3, ohci_hcd
    17:     183325          1   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd, eth0
    18:     119211          1   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx, aic7xxx, Ensoniq AudioPCI
    19:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
   NMI:          0          0 
   LOC:   58999640   58999802 
   ERR:          0
   MIS:         26
Should I think about using that daemon to move interrupts around?
Gotta go find the pointer to that stuff again.
Thanks again Andrew!
John
