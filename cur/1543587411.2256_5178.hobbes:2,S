Subject: Request for Configure.help entries for newly added config options.

As of kernel 2.4.3-ac5, there are now 574 config options which have
no help text in Configure.help. I believe these are not derived options,
but setable options which could use a help entry.
Here is a list of these items which have been introduced very recently.
Each group is incremental, versus 2.4.3-ac[n-1].
Of course, there are 548 other options which also should have texts.
If you see one of your options here, please consider generating a patch
for Configure.help, or send me the information and I'll do the rest.
Thanks,
Steven
