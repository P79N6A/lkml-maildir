Hmm.. While you're at it, would it make sense to encode the "When"
into the filename? Like 2010-09-sys_sysctl or 2.6.26-feature-X.
Requires renaming when something is given more time to live, though.
On the positive side, I think it'd help in keeping these current. 2.6.24
has e.g.
What:   PCMCIA control ioctl (needed for pcmcia-cs [cardmgr, cardctl])
When:   November 2005
If the date/release has been reached and the feature hasn't been removed
either more time is added or the feature gets removed.
