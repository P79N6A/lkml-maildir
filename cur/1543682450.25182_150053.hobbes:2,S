modprobe.conf syntax is easy to implement but unfortunately PITA to use. 
Exactly probe and probeall have been very helful in tracking module 
dependencies. Now you have arbitrary shell line that is near to impossible to 
parse in general.
I added half-hearted support to mkinitrd and initscripts for Mandrake but it 
will never be complete given the current situation.
Also I fixed devfsd to correctly use modprobe.devfs or modules.devfs depending 
on which kernel it runs on; patch has been sent both to lkml and devfs list 
and is included in current Mandrake devfsd.
actually adding probe and probeall is trivial enough, I did not want to base 
Mandrake packages on that to avoid incompatibility.

as long as you have memory-based /dev you need devfsd even if it is called 
differently.
