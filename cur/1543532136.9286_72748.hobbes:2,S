For the record, the threading library from what will be Apache 2.0
(Apache Portable Runtime) is based on pthreads at the moment. It
doesn't share any code with NSPR (the Netscape/Mozilla lib) and is
under a different license.
I doubt there would be any problem with adding code to work directly
off of Linux clone(). Someone just has to write it.
