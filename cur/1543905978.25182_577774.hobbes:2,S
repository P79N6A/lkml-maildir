Would be nice if you increased the indentation of the kmalloc line for
better readability, now that the expression is shorter.
In the rest of arch/cris/arch-v32/mm/intmem.c, one tab is typically used
for such continuation indentations.  However, intmem.c is not a prime
example for good whitespace usage, so you could as well use two tabs.
Also note that there are two more kmallocs with unnecessary cast in the
same file, at least in 2.6.23-rc1.  Would be nice if you cleaned up the
whole file at once.
There is also a shadowing of a local variable (tmp) by another local
variable of the same name.  Maybe you could submit another cleanup patch
for that too while you are at it?
