I guess it isn't doing the cmov because it doesn't want to do the
extra load in the common case, which is fair enough (are you compiling
for a pentiumpro+, without generic x86 support? what about if you
turn off optimise for size?)
At least other archtectures might be able to make better use of it,
and I agree even for i386 the code looks better (and slightly smaller).
