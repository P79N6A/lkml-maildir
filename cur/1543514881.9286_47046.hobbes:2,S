Hi,
After upgrading from 2.2.12 to 2.2.13, kppp, KDE's PPP dialer, claims
that it cannot find neither kernel nor modular PPP support. This is
clearly
not the case, and ignoring the message and proceeding with dialup
results
in a successful connection. However, seeing this message everytime
is annoying, and may confuse new users and lead them to believe
something
is wrong with their PPP setup.
Is anyone else having this problem? Is this a known issue?
Best Wishes,
	Koby Kahane
