On my non-buggy(*) KT133A board with the 55th register set to 09 I get these results;

Setting the register to 00

In my view these are pretty similar.
(*) - Yes, I did report a buggy KT133A Epox 8KTA/3 board, but the board and processor croaked, and my vendor replaced them with an Epox 8KTA/3 Pro board, and I've had no problems with it so far.
Yours,
