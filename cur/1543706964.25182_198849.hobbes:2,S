I am maintaining osst, which is available in both 2.4 and 2.6. It works very 
well, and the DI-30 is supported by it through ide-scsi. In contrast, 
onstream code in ide-tape has not been maintained, and is buggy. To ease my 
work, I want osst to be the only onstream code in the kernel.
So the "obsolete" refers to ide-tape's implementation only, not the drive.
