Ok, here's exactly, what I see:
1) during start-up 1 message
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
2) at run-time ERR: count increases - sometimes several per
second, sometimes it remains constant for some time.
3) No more "spurious" messages
4) I saw definitely situations, when between 2 /proc/interrupts snapshots
the sum of all (except the timer) interrupts was smaller, than the number
of errors, e.g.
           CPU0 (2nd shot)
  0:      36557  37638 +1081 XT-PIC  timer
  1:         59     65    +6 XT-PIC  i8042
  2:          0      0       XT-PIC  cascade
  5:          0      0       XT-PIC  VIA686A
  8:          3      3       XT-PIC  rtc
  9:          0      0       XT-PIC  acpi, uhci_hcd, uhci_hcd
 10:          0      0       XT-PIC  eth0
 12:         84     84       XT-PIC  i8042
 14:       1910   1918    +8 XT-PIC  ide0
 15:          1      1       XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:         18     18
LOC:      36460  37541 +1081
ERR:         36     57   +21
ide0 + i8042 (keyboard) = 14, whereas errors increased by 21. So, if you
are right, than Alan's wrong (or my understanding of his statement), and
those spurious interrupts occur not only after real ones, or, one real
interrupt can produce several spurious ones.
Thanks
