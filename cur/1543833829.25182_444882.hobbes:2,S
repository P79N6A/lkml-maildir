Hello Friend,
My name is Mrs. Hing David I am a dying woman who has 
decided
to donate what I have to charity through you.You may be 
wondering why I
chose you. But someone has to be chosen. I am 59 years 
old and was
diagnosed for cancer about 2 years ago,immediately after 
the death of 
my husband who had left me everything he worked for.I 
have been touched by
the lord to donate from what I have inherited from 
my late husband to
charity through you for the good work of humanity,
rather than allow my
relatives to use my husband's hard earned funds 
inappropriately.
I have asked the lord to forgive me all my sins and I 
believe he
has,because He is merciful. I will be going in for an 
operation,and I 
pray that I survive the operation.
I have decided to 
WILL/Donate the sum of $5.5 Million (Five Million
five Hundred thousand 
Dollars) to charity through you for the good work 
of the lord, and to 
help the motherless,less privileged and also for the
assistance of the 
widows. At the moment I cannot take any telephone
calls, due to the 
fact that my relatives are around me and I have been
restricted by my 
doctor from taking telephone calls because I deserve 
all the rest I 
can get.
Presently,I have informed my lawyer about my decision in 
WILLING this
fund to charity through you. I wish you all the best and 
may the good
Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well 
and always
extend the good work to others.
If you are interested in 
carrying out this task,i will inform my Family
Lawyer so that he can 
arrange the release of the funds to you.
I know i have never met you 
but my mind tells me to do this,and I hope
you act sincerely.I will pay 
you 30% of this money if you will assist
me because I am now too weak 
and frigile to do things myself because of
my cancer.
NB: I will 
appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until
the task is 
accomplished,as I don't want anything that will Jeopardize
my last 
wish, due to the fact that I do not want relatives or family
members 
standing in the way of my last wish.
Love,
Hing David
