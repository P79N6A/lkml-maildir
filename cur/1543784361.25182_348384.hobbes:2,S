Right, IPW2100 came with Legacy fw load first. Maybe that was dragged from
long time ago and used incorrectly.
I'm 100% sure that new versions of hotplug try to look at /lib/firmware and
was /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware before, but there was some discussion that
/lib would make more sense cause /usr could be dependant on other stuff.
Jesper already signed the patch.
