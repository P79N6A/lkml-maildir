In my early Linux days, UMSDOS was quite a neat thing to have for
showing Linux to friends by placing a .zip'ed Linux installation on
their MS-DOS machines.
So for historic reasons, I think it would be nice to have UMSDOS around.
However, one can achieve the same (with a lot more work) by placing a
loop-mountable ext2 FS and start it from an initrd. Much more
complicated, not that flexible (loop-mounted files don't typically
grow:)
So, it's quite nice to have it (had), but there's no strong need to keep
it IMO.
