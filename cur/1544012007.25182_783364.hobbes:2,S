Yes.

Oleg pointed out that we could drop SIG_DFL signals to global init early
to ensure wait_for_completion_killable/lock_page_killable don't incorrectly
believe that a fatal signal is pending. (patch 2/6).
If that patch is valid regardless of containers, it would be a minor
extension to get container-inits to drop SIG_DFL signals too, right ?
So the bigger problem/unknown for me is the sig_from_user() in patch 4/6
(i.e determining if it safe to deref the pid-ns of sender). We went from
!in_interrupt() to the SIG_FROM_USER flag to this.
If that is correct, I am hoping it would come down to opitmizing the code
if possible (eg: can/should we avoid passing same_ns into sig_ignored()
There is probably some ugliness :-) but do you see any other correctness 
issues ?
