Re the page cache: It needs also to be able to handle large page sizes of 
course. Scanning gazillions of page structs in vmscan.c will make the 
system slow as a dog. The number of page structs needs to be drastically 
reduced for large I/O. I think this can be done with allowing compound 
pages to be handled throughout the VM. The defrag issues then becomes very 
pressing indeed.
We have discussed the idea of going to kernel with 2M base page size on 
x86_64 but that step is a bit drastic and the overhead for small files 
would be tremendous.
Support for compound pages already exists in the page allocator and the 
slab allocator. Maybe we could extend that support to the I/O subsystem? 
We would also then have more contiguous writes which will further speed up 
I/O efficiency.
