Subject: [PATCH] intel-rng: Undo mess made by an 80 column extremist
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/7/205

The intel-rng printed a nice well formatted message when the port was
disabled. Someone then came along and blindly trashed it by screwing up a
trim down to 80 columns.
Put it back into the right format and keep the overlong lines as the
result is also MUCH easier to read in this specific case.
