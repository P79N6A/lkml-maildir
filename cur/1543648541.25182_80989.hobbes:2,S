If it comes to that, go ahead and apply the patch. I would far rather 
have an LSM that requires GPL'd modules than no LSM at all.

There are half a dozen modules here 
http://lsm.immunix.org/lsm_modules.html
I suspect there is a lot more use of LSM pending, and it will appear 
when the LSM interface stops changing, and when Linux 2.6 (or 3.0, 
whatever) appears. See for example the cover story in the September 2002 
Linux Journal: an LSM module being built by Ericsson Research for telco 
purposes.

Thanks for the clarification, but that still leaves questions. In 
particular, it is unclear whether a work is "derived" if it includes 
kernel header files, which is more or less required if you hope to make 
a module fit the interface.
Note that if we decide that #include of a kernel header file means that 
a work is derived, then we cause another problem: most Linux 
applications come under the GPL.  glibc #includes some kernel header 
files, and most Linux applications #include glibc headers, so most 
applications are #including kernel header files. If #include is the 
basis for declaring a module to be a derived work of the kernel, then 
there is some bad news coming for people who like to use Oracle and DB2 
on Linux ...
Thanks,
