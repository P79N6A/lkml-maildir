There are other build problems. m68k doesn't compile, because siginfo_t is
defined after the generic include and the inline functions in there access
that structure. On the other hand I can't put the include after the
definition, as it depends on other defines in the include.
I worked around it with some ugly hacks, but a proper fix would be very
welcome.
bye, Roman
