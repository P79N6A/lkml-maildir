I think one always gets one's environment tuned to fit himself. (At least 
I do.) I still have some 2.0 machines running, and they're running fine. 
They ran fine since Adam, and will still run fine as long as 2.0 is 
maintained. I can run them without too much administration effort (this is 
cool, since they're about 100 miles away...)
When I have them administrated, I always get this comfortable feeling, 
because the most of it is done by large scripts which check input and 
compute the output by themselves. If I dropped e.g. the old firewalling 
style, I'd have to change ~60% of my scripts to the new firewalling style.
I think this is a good reason not to upgrade to a so-called "recent" 
kernel on those boxes.
