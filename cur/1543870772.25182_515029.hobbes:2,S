Yes, but the hook point now happens before the page table mapping.  Not 
that it should cause a problem.  But we've been testing things the 
original way for over a year now, and if we want to get the fix upstream 
for 2.6.21, it seems better to upstream a more tested fix rather than a 
new way of doing things, even if it is identical in theory.
That said, I have no problems with the approach you propose going 
forward.  I just don't think it is appropriate for an -rc release, 
because it provides no tangible benefit for any of the in-kernel code, 
and causes a lot of retesting.  I still believe there is almost zero 
risk to doing things the way you propose.  But I am also a firm believer 
in shipping what is tested and working unless there is a compelling 
reason to do otherwise.  And if Xen is not going to be in 2.6.21, the 
compelling reason becomes getting the code working for both of us for 
2.6.22 - so let's do that, and keep the patches from Andrew's -mm tree 
around to make sure that we have a suitable patch base that can be 
applied to 2.6.21 for any distros that are willing to pick up the Xen 
paravirt-ops.
Sound reasonable?
