Linux 2.6.14.2, yeah, I know, and sorry if this has been fixed...but read on, please,
this is a new take...
So everything else is equal...same rootfs, same command line, same
kernel, and same modules...
When I boot my x86 board with one BIOS (and bootloader, not to forget that),
I can modprobe 'til the proverbial cows come home...
With the other BIOS (and its own bootloader), modprobe'ing ANY module gets this:
# modprobe ide-core
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address e081e000
 printing eip:
c0127ae5
*pde = 01774067

I've seen others post similar issues, but no one has correlated it to a BIOS issue.
Can anybody suggest to me why on earth BIOS would matter when
modprobe'ing???  I'm a BIOS engineer, and I can fix my own @#$%, but
I cannot fathom the connection, at least not while I can pass a breathalizer test...
Thanks,
John
P.S.:  I've not been able to find any other problems or issues on either BIOS.  Modules
that were linked in at build time (full USB stack, a couple of SCSI mods., and a few
network mods. all work fine...), and no other manifestations that anything is amiss...
I can provide more details, but all I'm looking for is a hint at what the connection between
load_module and BIOS might be...I can probably take it from there...
