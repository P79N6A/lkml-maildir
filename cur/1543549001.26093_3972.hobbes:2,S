There was a round of discussion about /proc.../serial back in May.  It
covered corruption and bad addresses.  Although it didn't specifically say
"I'm fixing the segmentation fault that some people are going to report",
they did indeed discuss the bad data, smp locking, and etc precisely on
serial.c.
If a specific problem such as a bad address went away by upgrading, there's a
very strong chance that the bug was fixed.  Such problems aren't likely to
migrate around in the kernel and be hidden, they tend to stay localized.
Instead of searching for a given author's comments, diff the two files and
see if the initializing code changed.  A lot of fixes go in without specific
credits.
