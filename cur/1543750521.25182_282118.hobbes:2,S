You asked this question on the fedora lists before. I gave you the
answer. Why are you asking it AGAIN but now on this mailing list where
it is somewhat offtopic ?????
(and for those who are not called Srinivas and not subscribed to the
fedora lists; the answer was that if you enable selinux on fedora core
3, you need to run at least a 2.6.9 and preferably a 2.6.10 kernel,
older 2.6 kernels are not new enough selinux wise; and Srinivas was
trying a 2.6.6 kernel)
