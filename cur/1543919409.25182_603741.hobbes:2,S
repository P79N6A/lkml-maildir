Thank you for your answer :)
I thought CF/IDE adapters are mainly electrical adapters.. I've never seen
one which explicitly states the modes it supports. On the other hand it
says on the package: "Vista compatible" (whatever that means)
Is there some way I can figure it out? I'll have a deeper look on the
datasheet when I'm home again later, but I'm rather sure there wasn't
anything mentioning supporting data transfer modes..
Best regards,
Philipp
