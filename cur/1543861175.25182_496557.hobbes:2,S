There are several cases where changing the tree doesn't affect the
correctness of the tar or cp -a result.  In some of these cases using
samefile() instead of st_ino _will_ result in a corrupted result.
Generally samefile() is _weaker_ than the st_ino interface in
comparing the identity of two files without using massive amounts of
memory.  You're searching for a better solution, not one that is
broken in a different way, aren't you?
