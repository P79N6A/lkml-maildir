I don't quite understand. You are supposed to dd_rescue the whole block
device to a working drive and use fsck on the copy.  Whatever is lost in
the process must of course be restored from a recent backup. But, as a
friend of mine put it recently, people don't need backup, they only need
restore ; )
fsck on a faulty drive might cause even more damage - how do you know
that other areas of the device are OK? 
I also oppose the ReiserFS-v3.x design philosophy regarding faulty
storage layer, but in any case where your _live_ data is valuable and
uptime counts, you _really_should_ use a RAID of some sort.
Kind regards,
