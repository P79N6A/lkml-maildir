It's 2 AM so I don't know if I'm making sense, but I had an idea for the
sort of clock I think you're looking for.
Couldn't one of the CPU performance counters do this?  I think you can
set one to count cycles and trigger every 100,000, or 10,000 or 1,000,
or whatever.  Then when you get that interrupt hit the context switch.
Then every time slice would be in cycles and not wall-clock, which is
what I think you wanted.
