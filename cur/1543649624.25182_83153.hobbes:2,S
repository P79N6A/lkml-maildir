	Wow ! That's a weird one.
	The file in question is in .../arch/i386/mach-generic/. You
may be able to modify the compile directive to add that to the
compilation (a "-I" argument).
	Alternatively, you can drop the source code directly in the
kernel (you just replace the old smc-ircc.o with the new one and
recompile).
