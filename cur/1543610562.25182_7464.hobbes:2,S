Well, the problem got solved (although not in a way I'd consider
satisfactory). After my machine started random segfaulting the day
before yesterday, I memcheck86'ed it again (the last check is a mere two
months ago), and lo - all three RAM chips were broken. Unfortunately, I
discovered this, after this broken RAM caused my /usr partition to go
fubar, resulting in me spending yesterday with a nice little reinstall.
After the reinstall, 2.4.14 booted fine off the harddisk. No more
oopses. 
As to the cause of the problem: I think I can rule out the possibility
of getting a bad kernel compiled due to the bad ram, as I booted once
well below the problem zones with mem=32m and recompiled a kernel with
that and tried to boot - same symptoms. 
Maybe lilo was broken or didn't like the MBR it was written to, or
something along those lines.
Thanks to all who tried to help me!
Regs,
Sven
