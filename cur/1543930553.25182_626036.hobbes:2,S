Really? 
udelay() seems to use
... cpu_data(raw_smp_processor_id()).loops_per_jiffy .. 
..so it seems that bug trap is already there... because
raw_smp_processor_id() will probably just oops...
We could solve this by pre-initializing loops_per_jiffy to some huge
number, but I do not see convenient place where to do that.
