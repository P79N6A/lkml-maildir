Your claim was that even if the API will drop an event at registration 
time, my code scheme would not work.  Thus, we can take "the API will 
drop an event at registration time" as postulated.  That being 
postulated, if there is still data to be read/written on the file 
descriptor then the first event_wait will return immediately.
In fact, given that postulate and the appropriate axioms about the 
behavior of event_wait() and do_io(), one can prove that my code scheme 
is equivalent to yours.  The logical conclusion from that and your claim 
would be that you don't understand how edge triggered APIs have to be used.

The wrong way as defined by what?  Having /dev/epoll drop appropriate 
events at registration time permits a useful simplification/optimization 
and makes the system significantly less prone to subtle progamming errors.
I do understand how such APIs work, to the extent that I am pointing out 
a flaw in their current models.

Nonsense.  People are able to use flawed APIs all of the time.
