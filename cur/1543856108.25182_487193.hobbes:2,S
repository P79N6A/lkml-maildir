Hmm, let's put this in a C file:

And put this in a header:

Now put this in another source file

The obvious result is that it prints "It hasn't happened yet!"  
twice.  On the third iteration when my_global == 2 it breaks out of  
the loop.  This is all fairly standard C so far.
Imagine we change the code to read from some auto-increment hardware  
at a specific MMIO address instead of a global:

But you're telling me that the change in the header file (where the  
new function returns the exact same series of values with every call  
as the old) causes the program to enter an infinite loop?
How do you rationalize this again?

Actually, no.  The reason for the volatile in the pointer dereference  
is to force the memory access to *always* happen.  It's a guarantee  
that the compiler will do that memory access every time it appears.   
You have a volatile int afterwards and what you do with that nobody  
cares.  The point is the presence of the volatile in a single pointer- 
dereference forcibly turns off any optimization of that specific  
access, including loop unrolling and such.
