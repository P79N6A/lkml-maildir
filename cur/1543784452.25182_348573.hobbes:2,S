As pointed to be Andrew a few days ago, this driver supports a lot of 
chips - for most of them the test hardware would be hard to come by 
and the documentation even more. Unless you'd like to do it based on 
"whoever is interested should cry loud"...

Yes, there is only one interrupt that for data transmission (both Tx 
and Rx), statistics, errors and (for those chips that support it) link 
state change.

You probably didn't look at the code. The MII registers are not 
exposed in the PCI space, they need to be accessed through a serial 
protocol, such that each MII register read is in fact about 200 (in 
total) of outw and inw/inl operations.
