Heh... and it's the default value.

I guess the BIOS setting will simply be overwritten so changing the BIOS 
should not affect subsequent use, no?

Well... I can't find a straight BIOS update for this board.  There is a 
Windows application to fetch and install a new BIOS from the net but 
installing Windows on this machine just for that is not really 
practical.
