Yes this is the approach I prefer, because we burden the fast/normal
path less that way (RT->NORMAL transition is not common). That's why I
was considering a set_curr_task() method in fair_sched_class which will
be invoked in __setscheduler() if the new policy of currently running
task happens to be SCHED_NORMAL/BATCH. Alternately if the new policy of
currently running task happens to be SCHED_FIFO (and its old policy was
SCHED_NORMAL) we need to invoke put_prev_task() method (so that
fair_clock etc is updated based on outgoing task's execution time in
SCHED_NORMAL class).
