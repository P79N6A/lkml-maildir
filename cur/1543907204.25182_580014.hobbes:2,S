They can just use phys_to_nid() or equivalent instead. Putting the node
into the page flags is just a very minor optimization.  I doubt
actually you could benchmark the difference. While in theory the
hash lookup could be another cache miss in practice this should
be already hot since it's used elsewhere.

Really?  They forgot to document it then.
Anyways, if they don't have enough bits left they can always just
use the hash table and drop the node completely. Shouldn't make too much 
difference and IA64 has gobs of cache anyways.
I'm actually thinking about a PG_arch_2 on x86_64 too. arch_1 is already
used now but another one would be useful in c_p_a().
