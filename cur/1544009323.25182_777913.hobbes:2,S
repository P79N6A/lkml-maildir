What makes you think it will now boot up. The loop is already detected
and terminated. What will you do if it doesn't and you get no
diagnostics. How will distributions debug those reports in bugzilla.

Why not ? You have no idea how the other millions of Linux users have
their module loading rules configured. A change which breaks this
behaviour is a regression.
