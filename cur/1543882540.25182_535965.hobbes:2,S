We could approximate option (b) by setting a standard page size for the 
page cache and set the same page size in SLUB (slub is already boot time 
configurable in that respect). That will make large portions of the VM 
use the same page order. I can try to add similar controls to the page 
cache.
If the page size is set too high for a mount then we use the buffer 
head functionality to split the higher order page into pieces of the 
appropriate size. That could limit the number of page sizes that we need 
to support.
But I think we should first see how well Mel's antifrag work does.
