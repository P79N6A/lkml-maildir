The status at this time seems to be that there is no driver available and the specifications are not published either. Is someone working on a driver at the moment or are there any plans? Somehow it does not seem entirely unlikely that the past nightmare of linux-unreadable NTFS disks and media prior to the present NTFS driver will repeat itself with exFAT.
I wrote the driver for read-only exFAT driver at a few months ago.
However, I'm not working for it actively, because I can't make time for
it now.
If someone want to see it, email me.
