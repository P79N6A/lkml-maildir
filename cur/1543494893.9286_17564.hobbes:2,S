This is reproducible (which I guess makes it science !).  I tried two
different kernel versions on my Pentium II/233MHz, 48 MB RAM (there's free
RAM in all cases):
#procs  -2.0.36-  -2.2.2-
 2       33.385   22.516
25       57.702   50.944
50      115.616  119.622
This is just a sample... a couple of other tests also showed that 2.0.36 is
slower for (#procs < ~30) but faster thereafter.
