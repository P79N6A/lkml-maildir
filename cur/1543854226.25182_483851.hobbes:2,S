I still have a patch lying around for this one:
http://linux-m68k-cvs.ubb.ca/~geert/linux-m68k-2.6.x-merging/POSTPONED/357-mac89x0.diff
I don't remember 100% why I put it in my POSTPONED queue. Maybe because it was
rejected upstream?
If it's OK (it compiles fine with 2.6.19-rc5), please tell me, and I'll
resubmit it.
