Sigh, it seems this is what you get for being nice... ;)
Don't get it wrong IDE people (at least me) are also worried but
they know that there are cases in which ACPI support will help
(even if the main method should be talking to hardware directly)
NOW not in X years when we will have proper, architecture
independent suspend/resume handling (we can live with
"ide_acpi=on" kernel parameter before it happens happily).
I also pointed out that I would like to have generic code which
can be shared between libata and IDE drivers (after all both
can provide you with struct pci_dev * and port/device number).
It would be even better if this code will stay in drivers/acpi/ata.c
(?) and libata/IDE will just use the same functions (which will turn
to NOP if CONFIG_ACPI=n) for PATA.
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
