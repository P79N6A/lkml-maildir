1) Because some magic value like 0x23 would be better.
2) Because it hides bugs like double frees or dangeling references while
   creating a race condition. In the end, you'll get more hard-to-find bugs
   in exchange for papering over some easy-to-spot bugs.

That may hide bugs, too. Therefore this isn't done in the kernel unless you
intend to depend on an initial value.
