I looked through all the /var/log/messages files (actually all the files in
/var/log) and can't spot any bdflush entries.
This does however sound like it may be the suspect....  The machine has not
been down since these changes were made, so I figured that they would
"eventually" make their way to disk...  Perhaps I'm wrong.
Any other Ideas ?  :)
Thanks,
