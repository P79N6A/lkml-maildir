Yep.  It's
   linux-perf@www-klinik.uni-mainz.de
or
   linux-perf-digest@www-klinik.uni-mainz.de
for the  digestified version (which i  hope will work now...).  The list is
run using  majordomo, so  the usual  subscribtion/unsubscription procedures
apply.  Automatic archiving  is  turned  on, but  the  archive  is not  yet
available, because i want to remove  the mail addresses from the HTML pages
to prevent address  harvesting... (A course of action i  can only recommend
to anybody making an archive of lkml available to the public!)
An HTML frontend for (un)subscription will be available ASAP.
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
