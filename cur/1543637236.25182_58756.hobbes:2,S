yes, you are right, and i fixed them in -G3.
doh, i *thought* i fixed both places in -G3, but i only fixed irq_exit().  
the local_bh_enable() fix is in -G4:

but still we dont want to call do_softirq() all the time. local_bh_enable
is used in quite performance-sensitive networking code.

i dont think getting a preemption before softirqs are processed is a big
problem. Such type of preemption comes in form of an interrupt, which 
handles softirqs in irq_exit() anyway, so there's no delay.

okay - i've fixed irq_exit() once more in -G4, could you double-check it?
