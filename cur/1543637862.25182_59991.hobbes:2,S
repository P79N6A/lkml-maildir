Can you see if the 2.5.29 kernel fixes this problem?  The usb-serial
close() call has been modified to hopefully prevent this from happening
in the 2.5 tree.
And can you also send the output of /proc/bus/usb/devices with your
device plugged in?  There are a lot of different devices that work with
this driver, and I'd like to try to keep track of those that have
problems.
thanks,
