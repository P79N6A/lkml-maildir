kswapd is using alot cpu, but doesn't swap a thing to disk. It does it
during i/o (reading big file from disk or simular).
This is what ps shows me atm:
root         3 14.3  0.0     0     0  ?  SW   22:09   3:00 (kswapd)
The swap space hasn't been touched yet.
Is there a reason why it's using that much cpu "for nothing"?
