Never heard of it. Unfortunately, the issue I run into far more
frequently than tools not existing is users being unwilling or unable
to use them. In fact, it's even a relatively large hassle to get users
to boot with /proc/profile enabled regardless of its simplicity. For an
issue this common I would prefer that the most basic tools available
(i.e. the very few that are near-universal, e.g. readprofile(1) etc.)
report callers to spinlock contention by default.
That said, should other concerns override mine, and the decision is to
report the precise program counter for /proc/profile at all times for
all architectures, that decision would eliminate profile_pc() in favor
of instruction_pointer(), further consolidating /proc/profile code.
