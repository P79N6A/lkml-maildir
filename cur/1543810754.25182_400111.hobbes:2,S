Subject: [PATCH 0/6] some tasklist_lock removals
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/22/329

Depends on "[PATCH 0/3] make threads traversal ->siglock safe".
These patches are unordered, each of them could be applied/reverted
independently. Hopefully not every patch adds a bug.
Oleg.
