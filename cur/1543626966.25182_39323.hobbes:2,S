Yet Another Brainfart.  I've been having a lot of them recently.
I don't feel comfortable changing the API that much in a stable kernel
series.  Also, some other boards that have very small timeout windows
emulate a larger userspace timeout since it's quite possible that a
process won't get scheduled every 250ms.  I guess the only reason I can see
for such a small timeout window is if one needs 99.9999% uptime and the 29
extra seconds that the watchdog waits before kicking off is important.
