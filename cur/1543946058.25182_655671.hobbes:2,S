If you're going to copy the whole filesystem don't use rsync!  Use cp
or a tar pipeline to move the files.

Yes...

All filesystems are going to have problems keeping inodes close to
directories when you have huge numbers of hard links.
I'd really need to know exactly what kind of operations you were
trying to do that were causing problems before I could say for sure.
Yes, you said you were removing unneeded files, but how were you doing
it?  With rm -r of old hard-linked directories?  How big are the
average files involved?  Etc.
