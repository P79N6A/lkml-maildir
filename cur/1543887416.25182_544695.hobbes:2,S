Right.  That's the other user of cached work->wq_data pointer.

I don't think the test for PENDING should be atomic too.  cwq pointer
and VALID is one package.  PENDING lives its own life as a atomic bit
switch.

It actually is.

Which means that spin_lock() isn't a write barrier.  lock is read
barrier, unlock is write barrier.  Otherwise, locking doesn't make much
sense.  If we're going the barrier way, I think we're better off with
explicit smp_wmb().  It's only barrier() on x86/64.
Thanks.
