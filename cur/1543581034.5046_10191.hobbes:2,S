This is a good observation.
I have no idea why I invoked ver_linux using "." : I must have
seen it somewhere and just followed it somehow.
Hard to tell where I have seen. I must have seen it in the last few
days.
Here is one URL where "." is used, but this was not where I saw the
usage.
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/devfs/mail/devfs/msg00261.html
I have found the same problem cropped up in the kernel mailing list
before.
    
http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0003.1/0898.html
The above thread showed that non-other than Alan Cox also chimed in the
thread.
So there must have been a reason to let people try "." for
invoking /usr/src/linux/scripts/ver_linux.
One theory might be that, as a root, people may run
    # ./ver_linux   (under scripts directory).
And then, when they try to show what they did, they may
create a report showing the FULL path name of the scripts so that
there is no mistaking ver_scripts for something else.
And in doing so, somebody might have forgotten to remove the
leading "."
    #./usr/src/linux/scripts/ver_linux
Somebody eles looked at the above and "figured" that the
leading "./" is a typo and thus corrects it to ". /"
and now we have
   #. /usr/src/linux/scripts/ver_linux
Anyway, I have found another  libc version output
in somebody's post. The poster must have similar problem as I did.
(See at the end for ver_linux output result. )
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9906.3/0990.html
So in any case, I think protecting the
ver_linux from strange interaction of various
shell features might be a good idea after all.
(I was not convinced why "sh /usr/src/linux/scripts/ver_linux" works
since /bin/sh is a symlink to bash in my setup and it seems that
my ./bashrc includes the ls alias. But when I tried it, it works. )
