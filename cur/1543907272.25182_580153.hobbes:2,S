Well, I'm complaining.  I think the problem here is that it isn't clear
which one is who's responsibility.  There's a Korean saying which
approximately translates into "if you have too many boatmen on a ship,
it goes to mountain".  We also have a bunch of Toshiba laptops which
want the ATA controller to be in enabled state when ACPI suspend is
invoked because the suspend method apparently wants to execute some
commands before going to sleep.
I wish ACPI spec carries a big fat sign saying "stay f*** away from
anything which isn't essential to the requested operation".

No, we can't unless we snoop ACPI method execution and detect accesses
to IO ports or iomem regions.  It's not going through any driver.  This
is a gross mess.
