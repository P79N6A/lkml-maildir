Hi,
This is 2.2.10 UP kernel.
There was a kernel opps at boot (/etc/init.d/network) :
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
current->tss.cr3 = 05be7000, %cr3 = 05be7000
*pde = 00000000

After booting :
root@stargate:~# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
[...]
rtl8139                11052   1  (uninitialized)
And ping <some machine in localnetwork> casues infinite loop of opps at the
screen with growing and growing size of call trace section of opps and
finally a 'nice' reboot at the end.
I don't know what the problem can be since this machine works for days
without any problems and in some cases there is NO opps at the boot
and then ping and other things works, but sometimes there is the opps
and then ...
Sorry, but I don't know too much about opps reporting : I can't
resolve the numeric values in my report since imho they're in
the rtl8139 module so gdb vmlinux like solution does not work for me ;-(
Thanx, Gabor.
