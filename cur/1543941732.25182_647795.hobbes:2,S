Hi Ingo,
   OK, this problem was caused by asm-offsets.c only having the offsets when
lguest *guest* support was set, not lguest host (host support used to imply
guest support, so now they're separate these bugs come out).
Can you throw this patch into your tree for testing?
Thanks,
Rusty.
Lguest guest support and host support are separate config options: they used
to be tied together.  Sort out which parts of asm-offsets are needed for Guest
and Host.
