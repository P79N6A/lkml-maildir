It doesn't prevent someone from using the speaker.  It just stops
programs that do a ^G from beeping.  Programs and scripts are
free to call setterm again and change the blength as they want.
A kernel option, makes for a completely silent PC speaker.  Aside
from accessing the ioports directly perhaps.
