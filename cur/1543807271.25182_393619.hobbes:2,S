I'd have thought it would be saner to split these things apart:
"slab_spread", "pagecache_spread", etc.

That's not a terribly assertive name.  cpuset_mem_spread_needed()?

OT: do we ever set PF_foo on a task other than `current'?  I have a feeling
that we do...

hm.  What guarantees that a node which is in current->mems_allowed is still
online?
