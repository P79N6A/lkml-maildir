Subject: [BUG] P4 HT cpufreq driver doesn't share governor/frequency between siblings

Small bugreport, Pentium 4 Hyper-Threaded with SMP kernel (2.6.4-bk
from Mar 11) and p4-clockmod module loaded, gives:
# cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
# cat cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
performance
performance
# echo powersave > cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
# cat cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
performance
powersave
Shouldn't the cpufreq driver be shared between the siblings?
