This does not make sense...
lxdialog are compiled utilising HOSTCC, and HOSTCC always points to gcc.
So unless you fail to keep gcc for native in PATH and use:
$> make CROSS_COMPILE=arm all
to do cross-compile the above scenario should not be possible.
In other words
$> which gcc
shall always point to the gcc used for native architecture. Cross
compiling are done by specifying another gcc using the above syntax.
[I've only looked in 2.5 sources by the way, 2.4 may differ here].
Another point is that the current kbuild is too weak when architecture
is changed. Changing architecture should require a make mrproper.
