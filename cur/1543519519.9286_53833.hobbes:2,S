So while we are renumbering things, we should also call it the 20th century?
After all, the first two digits are 20 so it must be the 20th century from
2000-2099.
Also, most people in the world do start counting from 1. It is only when you
remind them that there is a zero that they start counting there. Even we say
that element [0] of an array is the first element.

Actually, the calendar has been adjusted several times in the intervening
time. It doesn't really matter how you choose the starting point of a
calendar provided that you have agreement. Right now, the agreement is that
we will call this the 1999th year of the current calendar. We totally ignore
the correction where half a month was skipped, and several other minor
adjustments.
Getting the terminology consistent, so everyone is using the same frame of
reference, is what is important.

Correctness in all things should matter. 'So what's an RFC to you anyway'
would probably be a good description of M$ attitude towards standards. Just
because most computer users don't care about the details of RFCs doesn't
change their importance.
Same thing applies to other fields.
