Hi!
After upgrade of kernel 2.6.2 -> 2.6.3 (built from exactly the same
config) I'm no longer able to use my TV tuner card. When I launch tvtime
following appears in system log:
kernel: tuner: Huh? tv_set is NULL?
tvtime reports that "there is no signal" and when I try to change the
channel, following appears in the log:
kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency? [main=1bd24000,o_vbi=1bd24018,o_field=e74c000,rc=ee9c3e0]
kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency? [main=1bd24000,o_vbi=1bd24018,o_field=e74e000,rc=e74e024]
kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency? [main=1bd24000,o_vbi=1bd24018,o_field=e74e000,rc=e74e01c]
kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency? [main=1bd24000,o_vbi=1bd24018,o_field=e750000,rc=e75001c]
kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency? [main=1bd24000,o_vbi=1bd24018,o_field=e750000,rc=eb8d340]
kernel: tuner: Huh? tv_set is NULL?
The tuner is some Prolink card based on BT878. It still works when I
boot 2.6.2 (with following settings in modules.conf:
options tuner type=5
options bttv card=16
).
Is there any chance for this to be fixed?
Regards
