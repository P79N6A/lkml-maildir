All the people with slow connections bless bzip2. If you or someone want 
a new compressor, write a program for it, call it something unique so 
people will know it's different, and be happy.
Even with a fast line, I can only pull as fast as the source can push, 
so smaller is better for all of us. The time to decompress a tar.bz2 and 
tar.gz are very similar, the CPU for bzip2 is about double, and the time 
to create the directories and write the files is the same in either case.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
