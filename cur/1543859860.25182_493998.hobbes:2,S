Thanks, i have now a 2.6.19.1 patched with the above NFS_ALL patchset 
running under load since about 17:00 and still going strong. So seems to 
have solved the problem!
Also, performance seems to have significantly increased. I am testing 
this with MythTv with the storage over NFS. With HD LiveTV (which  is 
what i use to test this), this translates into about 43Mbps total load, 
from almost 15Mbps video stream which is present 3x on the ethernet:
1/ from card to NFS disk
2/ read from NFS disk
3/ stream to viewer app.
Doing this with HD streams before the patch set resulted in regular 
picture hickups. No hickups visible anymore (that i have seen, i have 
not been present all this time).
Regards,
Rudy
