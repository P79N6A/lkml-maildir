Hmm. I would expect most of the to continue to work because they
are valid.  The only problem I see is when he starts scrunching
things together by changing the value of fields that have a specified
meaning.

Sanity checks are always good for future compatibility so someone does
not come to rely on your bugs.  This is less of a problem in linux than
in some systems but still.  This is the primary reason cpus have undefined
opcode exceptions for example.

That was my impression as well.  Increasing the complexity of the
if statements when goto's are already in use seems silly.
