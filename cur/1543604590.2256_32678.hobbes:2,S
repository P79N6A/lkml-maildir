Well, I've rebooted the thing.
It appears that whatever it was looping on was in the kernel.  I suspect that it
has something to do with NFS--this is a 2.2.17 kernel and we ran into some
issues with it and NFS on some other systems.
Thanks for the help guys...unfortunately I rebooted before getting the messages
about checking in /proc--it would have been interesting to see what it was
doing.
