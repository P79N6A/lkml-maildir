But we'd have to implement a tree structure on top of that.
If for doing "real" things we have to use some device file with
some helper program, we can do away with the whole filesystem
thing just as well -- *always* use that helper program.
On the PowerPC side of things, we have binary properties in
the device tree filesystem, and have a simple user space
program to make it readable as text.

That only works for sysfs because there is the "one value
per file" rule -- something the OF device tree doesn't do,
and doesn't need to do, since it uses a well-defined binary
format.
If you *really* want (the option of) showing things as text
in the filesystem, you better make it so that there is a
one-to-one translation back to binary.  For example, what
does this mean, is it a text string or two bytes:
01.02
Yes you as a user can guess, but scripts can't (reliably).

Yeah.  And I'd like to have it as a collection of function
pointers so the arch code can put in the implementation it
needs at boot time.  Flexibility is good.
