I dont agree. Policy is userspace but enforcing the policy very often needs 
kernel support.
Having ACL in 2.6 is an example where operating system already adopted to 
special needs. Furthermore, the kernel is already able to drop special 
capabilites, like module loading.  Having a generalised capabilites model 
is a good idea and there are already some more or less usable security 
modules.
