If you figure this out forward what you did to me. Do you have problems
with any of the 2.2.1-ac?'s. I tried ac1 and ac2 with no results.
my machine is very similar. Isa ne2k, internal modem on ttyS1, PODP5V83, 
started as slack 3.6, upgraded to glibc. I rebuilt libc6 to eliminate that
as a possibility. 
Strange thing is i telneted to the smtp port on a remote machine and typed 
nice smtp commands to sendmail. I saw my commands but no respounces,
netstat -t showed it all as sitting in the sendQ. After I rebooted the
mail went through. Also I noticed if I finger a remote machine it says
established, and its ident request to my machine gets locked in SYN_RECV.
Sometimes identd gets spawned off sometimes it doesn't, but identd never
sends a name. I fired up pppstats which shows packets coming and going at
a similar rate as 2.0.36.
I have tried 2.2.0-pre9, 2.2.0, 2.2.1 with the same results. I had
booted other pre's but was experiencing problems with ttyS1 staying busy.
Hopefully this helps, if not it may give you somethings to try.
Mr. Shannon Aldinger
