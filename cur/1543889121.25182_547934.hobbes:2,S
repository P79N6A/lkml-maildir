Either there's some miscommunication, or bonghits.
(18:54:00:davej@gelk:kernel-2.6.18)$ kdiff vanilla/drivers/pci/pci-driver.c linux-2.6.18.noarch/drivers/pci/pci-driver.c 
(18:54:10:davej@gelk:kernel-2.6.18)$ 
And as there's no CONFIG option other than CONFIG_HOTPLUG (which we obviously enable)
I don't see any reason why this wouldn't be enabled in RHEL5.
(And I think mdomsch would have probably had a fit if he found out we were
 disabling it, but that's another story ;-)
