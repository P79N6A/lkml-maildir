Please send /proc/meminfo and /proc/slabinfo after the leak has been
happening for a while.
Sometimes `echo m > /proc/sysrq_trigger ; dmesg -s 1000000' will
provide useful info.
The page-owner code can pinpoint a leak source.  See
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.23/2.6.23-mm1/broken-out/page-owner-tracking-leak-detector.patch
Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK, check out /proc/slab_allocators
