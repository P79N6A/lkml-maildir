Umm.. we're gluttons for punishment ?-)

While it might be true that neither is better than the other, the history
of *why* each form was invented shows that they are not completely made up
constructs.  There is a method to the madness.

When the various network implementations were invented, do you thing all
those fancy tools you talk about existed?  Nope.  But, since those tools
exist *now*, I guess you could make the case that the format is irrelevent.

No, no.  The statment was ment to mean "ignore the endianness and work on
the betterment of the kernel, instead".  Sorry if I telegraphed the wrong
impression.

Calm down.  No, we don't think you're an endianness bigot.  In other
mail, I'd already stated that you'd made the choice of LE for IA-64 for
excellent reasons.  Backwards compatability for existing binaries, more
common for PC platforms, etc.  Most sane people accept that.  No-one
having any involvement with the kernel thinks you make arbitrary
decisions.
Now, have a beer and relax.
