The link is rather old indeed. I have been searching the people who are busy
now implementing IEEE 1003.1b now for a long time, but can't seem to find the
right persons. I they read this, please mail me.
I want to help implement RT timers! (have applied the patch mentioned in the
document above on a 2.2.5 kernel, but it is difficult to find out what things
have already been provided in the kernel or in libc! I finally made my own lib
and header file to test the thing)
Thx.
