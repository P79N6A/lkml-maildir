Hi Vivek,
Thanks for the quick reply!

Well, yes, other tools needs to be updated as well.
I just quickly went through the code for readelf from binutils-2.16.1
and in readelf.c, process_corefile_note_segment() always treats
alignment as 4. Broken. The bfd code in the same package seems to be
correct in most 64-bit cases though, struct elf_size_info ->
log_file_align seems to be the value we are looking for. It is set to
3 for at least elf64-{alpha, hppa, mips, s390, sparc}. I've not been
able to figure out the status for ppc and x86_64.
I do however believe that no-one has been troubled by this so far
because we happen to have well formed data. It seems like the only
string that is passed to append_elf_note() in the kdump case is "CORE"
and it is 5 bytes including terminating zero.
The old code adds 3 bytes and divides by 4 to get 2 32-bit values.
With my fix we would add 7 bytes and divide by 8 to get 1 64-bit value.
In both cases we pad to a total of 8 bytes. So we seem to be lucky with "CORE".
This also means that my fix doesn't affect the format of the data in
the current case.

Yes, that makes sense. I will have a look at it. I assume that
following the spec is what we want to do, but if someone disagrees
please shout _now_!
