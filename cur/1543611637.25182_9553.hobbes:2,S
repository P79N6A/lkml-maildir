That's correct.  Furthermore, those genitives were malformed. :-)
"Windows" is a singular noun.  Therefore the correct possessive form
is "Windows's", not "Windows'" -- the latter would be correct only 
if it were a *plural* noun.  
Similarly, the correct possessive form of "James" is not "James'" but
"James's".  This is often gotten wrong in these degenerate times,
mostly by the same people who confuse "its" with "it's". Etymologically,
"James's book" is a contraction of "James his book", which is how it
was done in Middle English (remembering the full form may help one
keep the rule straight).

Also correct.  Ah, English-usage geeking.  Good clean fun for the 
whole family...
