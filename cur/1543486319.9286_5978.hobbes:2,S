Right:-
2.0.35
strobe -f 127.0.0.1 &
!s !s !s.... etc
then another line to get loads of coppies going at once (the & is a MUST!)
This causes file table overflows and inode consumption big style
2.0.36 as above
2.2.1
This takes a hell of a lot more hammering (i think it was more the fact
that i never had any real (decent should i say) tcp wrappers runing).  i
managed to get the console to say [367] for the backround process number,
do a w and a ls (load was 48) then it froze with no hd access.
I didn't have any other kernels @ hand to test afraid.  have fun playing
with this.
btw without the & , u'll just get loads of ip dupes.
