How does one find out which machine one is on then? Most of the time,
I get no message saying what machine is being referred to.
The one system I do get an ID message from is SunSITE-UK which is the
one that shows nothing later than 2.3.9 in the v2.3 directory.
Most of the others I get to don't appear to have a /pub/linux/kernel
directory and I have to search for it, which is less than ideal...
Best wishes from Riley.
