The  ntp server  takes several external clock comparisons to know its
local running environments (hosts) clock behaviour.
Before it knows that, it has no real knowledge of what the time is,
and it won't report anything out.
In my environments I have couple local machines (usually doing
something else too) assigned as network local NTP servers, and
all other machines refer to them.
