Ah well, I see the problem -- it doesn't display disabled ROMs.
The following quick hack should cure it:
--- orig/lib/generic.c
+++ mod/lib/generic.c
@@ -160,7 +160,9 @@
       if (reg)
 	{
 	  u32 a = pci_read_long(d, reg);
+#if 0
 	  if (a & PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE)
+#endif
 	    d->rom_base_addr = a;
 	}
     }
				Have a nice fortnight
