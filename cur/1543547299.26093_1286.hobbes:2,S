I'm not sure whether it's worth the effort.  But I'm saying this now
looking at the code for another implementation following the 1:1 model.
In a second stage where we have m kernel threads and n user-level
threads (the ultimate goal) things might be different.  But this is
beyond what is needed in the 2.4 kernel so lets just skip the
SA_NOCLDWAIT stuff for now.
