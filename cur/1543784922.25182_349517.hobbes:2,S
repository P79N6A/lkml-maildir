Subject: [patch 2.6.13 0/16] implement ETHTOOL_GPERMADDR support for a number of drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/12/157

A collection of patches which add support for ETHTOOL_GPERMADDR to
the following drivers: 3c59x, 8139cp, 8139too, b44, bnx2, e1000,
e100, forcedeth, ixgb, ne2k-pci, pcnet32, r8169, skge, sundance,
tg3, via-rhine.
I apologize for all the small patches, but I wanted to trim the cc:
lists appropriately for each driver.
