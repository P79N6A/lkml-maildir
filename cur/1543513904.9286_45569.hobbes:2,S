Subject: [2.3.23] Problems compiling the kernel

Hello.
I downloaded kernel v2.3.23 and failed to compile it.
The first problem is with aty128.c driver.  It looks like FB_ACCEL_ATI_RAGE128
is not just defined in include/linux/fb.h.  When I added #define
FB_ACCEL_ATI_RAGE128 32, the compiling process passed this one.  BTW, is the
atyfb128 usable on x86 computers?
The second problem is with PIIX stuff.  For the first time I got `undefined piix_dmaproc'
error while linking.  Then I removed `static' qualifier from piix_dmaproc function, and
got another error:
    drivers/block/block.a(piix.o): In function `piix_dmaproc':
    piix.o(.text+0x4d3): undefined reference to `ide_dmaproc'
This (AFAICS) is result of my non-choosing `Generic PCI bus-master DMA support'
option (what, I believe, should never happen).
JFYI,
