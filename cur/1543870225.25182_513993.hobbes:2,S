Apologies for mangling the email address as I said :-(

Where do I say that? I do not presume to manage realtime priorities in any 
way. You're turning my argument about nice levels around and somehow saying 
that because hyperthreading breaks the single stream me semantics by 
parallelising them that I would want to stop that happening. Nowhere have I 
argued that realtime semantics should be changed to somehow work around 
hyperthreading. SMT nice is about managing nice only, and not realtime 
priorities which are independent entities.

But the buyer is not aware. You are aware because you tinker, but the vast 
majority of users who enable hyperthreading in their shiny pcs are not aware. 
The only thing they know is that if they enable hyperthreading their programs 
run slower in multitasking environments no matter how much they nice the 
other processes. Buyers do not buy hardware knowing that the internal design 
breaks something as fundamental as 'nice'. You seem to presume that most 
people who get hyperthreading are happy to compromise 'nice' in order to get 
their second core working and I put it to you that they do not make that 
decision.

Well you know as well as I do that you're selecting out the exception rather 
than the rule, and statistically overall, it does work.

Well that's certainly taking my logic for a ride. This is about managing 
_nice_ and _only_ nice. Nice specifies fixed interval static priorities where 
(in the risk of repeating myself) you are specifying that higher nice values 
tasks you wish to receive less cpu and more latency. Dynamic priorities have 
absolutely no effect on what the discrepancies are between the static 
priorities of differing nice values. As for realtime priorities, again, I do 
not presume to be managing them with SMT nice. They are unique entities 
unrelated to nice values. The only thing they have in common with nice levels 
is that if something is running without a realtime priority, it should be 
preempted by the realtime task as you have specified that the realtime task 
should receive all the cpu over the non-realtime task. I don't pretend that 
there is some cpu percentage relationship between different _realtime 
priorities_ and do not try to manage them in any way.

Again you're saying here that if the hardware breaks nice levels we should not 
bother trying to enforce them. As I said before, this is an extension of 
arguing that we should not try to enforce nice except on hardware that has 
priority support within the cpu.
We're going to have to agree to disagree, but feel free to have the final word 
of course.
