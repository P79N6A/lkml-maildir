The problem was caused when my code tried to read 0 bytes from a unix
socket (my fault, didn't specifically check for wanting to read 0 bytes,
assumed recv() would just return 0 ...).
When there is no data available, the code blocks. If, however, data is
available, recv() returns EGAIN. Is this correct behaviour? In kernel
2.2.19, recv() did in fact return 0;
Test example below.

{
  char buf[1];
  int s;
  int retval;
  struct sockaddr_un server;
  if (argc < 2)
    printf("Usage : test socketname");
  s = socket(PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (s < 0)
    perror("socket :");
  else
  {
    server.sun_family = PF_LOCAL;
    strncpy(server.sun_path, argv[1], sizeof(server.sun_path));
    if (connect(s,(struct sockaddr *)&server,SUN_LEN(&server)) < 0)
      perror("connect :");
    else
    {
      retval = recv(s,buf,0, 0);
      if (retval < 0)
        perror("recv :");
      else
        printf("Received %u bytes.",retval);
      close(s);
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
