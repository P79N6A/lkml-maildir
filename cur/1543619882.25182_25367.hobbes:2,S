	Ok, this is just a cosmetic thing, but I see that in 2.5.3 the printk 
text in pci_fixup_via_northbridge_bug in pci-pc.c was changed
- printk("Trying to stomp on VIA Northbridge bug...\n");
+ printk("Disabling broken memory write queue.\n");
	Can't we change this to some meaningful output in 2.4.18 as well? It's 
still the old text with pre7.
Bye
Oliver
