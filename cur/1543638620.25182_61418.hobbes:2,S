Hi,

Over a month later, here it is - this drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h
entry appears to be sufficient to make my Sagatek DCS-CF work:
/* aka Sagatek DCS-CF */
UNUSUAL_DEV(  0x07c4, 0xa400, 0x0000, 0xffff,
		"Datafab",
		"KECF-USB",
		US_SC_SCSI, US_PR_BULK, NULL,
		US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY ),
Not even US_FL_MODE_XLATE or US_FL_START_STOP is necessary as far as
I can tell, but I guess that may depend on the chip revision.
US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY is required, or the device does not work at all...
Boot messages (with a 64MB == ~61 MiB CF card) look like this:
scsi1 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
  Vendor: Datafab   Model: KECF-USB          Rev: 0113
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi1, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
SCSI device sda: 125185 512-byte hdwr sectors (64 MB)
sda: test WP failed, assume Write Enabled
 sda: sda1
WARNING: USB Mass Storage data integrity not assured
USB Mass Storage device found at 2
The "test WP failed" message appears to be harmless - I have tested
reading and writing, and it works for me.
