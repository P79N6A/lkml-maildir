The signature is supposed to be an ABI signature, so regardless of the
actual hypervisor version, it should always present "xen-3.0"
(presumably backwards compat if it also supports other versions of the
ABI).  There was a bug in some versions where it puts the actual
hypervisor version in there, requiring this patch.  Technically that
means that looking for "xen-3." is more accurate, but frankly not
important enough to bother raising a patch over.
