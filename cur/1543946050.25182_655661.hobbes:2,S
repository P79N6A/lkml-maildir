Hi,
	I don't know if I have to warn on this or not, but as I didn't find any
discussion, it's probably better to mention it: the compiling error reported
below (or here: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/4/173
 ) does not seem to be
corrected in 2.6.25-rc2.mm1...  So, I don't know if a fix is going on somewhere
or if the bug has fallen in a black hole.
(In the original mail, I've proposed a patch as a quick fix, but I don't know if
it can be considered as a definitive correction or not)
Thanks,
P.
