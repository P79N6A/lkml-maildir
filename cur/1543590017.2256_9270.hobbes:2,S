There are a couple of options here.
1) read the MTRRs unless the BIOS is braindead it will set up that area as
   write-back.  At any rate we shouldn't ever try to allocate a pci region
   that is write-back cached.
2) read the memory locations from the northbridge.  It's not possible
   on every chipset (lack of documentation) but with the linuxBIOS
   project we code for a couple of them, and we are working on more
   all of the time.
