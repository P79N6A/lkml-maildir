Why do you harp on "no true positives"?
That's a pointless thing. You can make *any* warning have "true 
positives". My personal favorite is the unconditional warning:
	warning: user is an idiot
and I _guarantee_ you that it has a lot of true positives.
It's the "no false negatives" angle you should look at.
THAT is what matters. The reason we don't see a lot of warnings about 
idiot users is not that people don't do stupid things, but that 
*sometimes* they actually don't do something stupid.
Yeah, I know, it's far-fetched, but still.
In other words, you're barking up *exactly* the wrong tree. You're looking 
at it the wrong way around.
Think of it this way: in science, a theory is proven to be bad by a single 
undeniable fact just showing that it's wrong.
The same is largely true of a warning. If the warning sometimes happens 
for code that is perfectly fine, the warning is bad.
