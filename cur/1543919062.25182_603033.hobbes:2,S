Subject: [PATCH] lockdep: Avoid /proc/lockdep & lock_stat infinite output
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When a read() requests an amount of data smaller than the amount of data
that the seq_file's foo_show() outputs, the output starts looping and
outputs the "stuck" element's data infinitely.  There may be multiple
sequential calls to foo_start(), foo_next()/foo_show(), and foo_stop()
for a single open with sequential read of the file.  The _start() does not
have to start with the 0th element and _show() might be called multiple
times in a row for the same element for a given open/read of the seq_file.

Assuming people are fine with this, it should probably find its way
to stable.
If you haven't seen the infinite output: it's easy to trigger with a
simple 'cat /proc/lockdep' generally for me, a cat /proc/lock_stat piped
to a file or for either of them a dd with the default bs=512 (or smaller)
should do the job also.
With this change to the lock_stat handler the data->iter member no longer
attempts to hold state across calls, so it could be taken out of the
lock_stat_seq struct and replace by a local variable in each function
but that isn't a clear win to me so I just left it.
