	Ta-da... I've just realized what will happen if we'll do
losetup /dev/loop0 foo
mount -t ext2 /dev/loop /mnt/1
losetup /dev/loop1 /mnt/1/bar
mount -t /dev/loop1 /mnt/2
	Besides, you don't really need loop-over-loop to get this
effect - do_lo_request() calls bmap() which may generate more than 1
buffer head and more than 1 request...
	Comments?
