I know it, but it's P150 overclocked to 166 and it can run even on 200
with 2.4.0-test11 and 2.2.x for several weeks without hanging up. But it
hangs up with -test12 several minutes after I start X server and
several people have already confirm that ...
(I'm going to try latest -test13-pre ... I cannot see Changelog or
test13.log anywhere ...)
Have a nice day
