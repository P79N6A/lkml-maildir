Just gcc & binutils. Because they are a bit tricky to use, you should have
a look at GNU libtool (
http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html
 )
to build your libraries. Making a library with libtool is as simple as:
  libtool --mode=compile gcc -O2 -Wall -c foo.c
  libtool --mode=link gcc -O2 -o libfoo.la -rpath /usr/local/lib foo.lo
