Try this patch, but it is given WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.
I even cann't test to compile it.
And there is not ieee card here.
So, it was wrote with luck and common sense.
I hope it will help you.
P.S. Here is also patch for video1394 and remap_page_range.
P.P.S. If this is full bullshit... then i apologize and go learning Linux
kernel again...
