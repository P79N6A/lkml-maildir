Assuming you meant s/task/function/:
	In the common case this will return a result because most tasks have a
real parent. The only exception should be the init task. However, the
init task does not "fork" from another task so this function will never
get called with WATCH_TASK_INIT and the init task.
	This means that if one wants to use per-task watchers to associate data
and a function call with *every* task, special care will need to be
taken to register with the init task.
