AFAIK clockpro will not leave free ram, will it?
Getting a little hand-wavy; I don't think the updatedb problem needs to
be fixed by a really fancy page reclaim algorithm (IMO, and that's not to
say that a fancy reclaim algorithm wouldn't be nice for other reasons).
Just small improvements here and there, and there will always be a tradeoff
between throughput and interactive pagein latency so in the end it might
need a tunable (hey there is one - maybe it needs to be improved)
