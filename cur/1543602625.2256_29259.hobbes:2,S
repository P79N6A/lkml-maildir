Subject: login vs. portmap revisited

I recently dug through the mail archives to figure why my login requires
portmap. It seems that poll or recvfrom return semantics  have changed
from 2.2 to 2.4, and some login or PAM didn't track the change.
Does anyone have details on this? Whom do I ask for updates? PAM guys?
glibc guys? "login" maintainer?
