I agree and that is how we have it on IA-64. With debugging, there is
always another process involved and no matter what I think it needs to 
be aware of the new child. I don't think autoamtic inheritance is good.
It should always be trigger by the controlling process (e.g., debugger).
There is enough support in ptrace to catch the fork/vfork/pthread_create
and decide what to do.  This is how I have coded perfmon so that hardware
performance counters are never automatically inherited.
