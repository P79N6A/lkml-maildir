Design by Contract, as seen in the Eiffel language, is not a one way 
promise, it's a contract between the caller and callee. Both sides have
to fullfil their part of the contract, the caller has to make sure that
the input are valid, and (only) given that, the callee can/has to make
sure that the caller gets the right output.
BTW, Bertrand Meyer is one of my professors, I should know the Eiffel 
language... :)

Whenever you have two sides/parties, you have to agree on _something_, 
otherwise you can't communicate, if you speak to someone, you have to 
choose a language in which to speak, that's the first agreement.
In this situation you have two sides, the kernel and the userspace. Your 
first agreement is the syscall number, and then the arguments, the type 
and format of the arguments, etc. Both sides have to agree on those things.
