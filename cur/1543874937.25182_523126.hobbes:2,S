Yea. From looking at your boot log, it does look like the PIT
clocksource is being used. 
This does point to an issue w/ that clocksource, however I noticed its
getting selected over the ACPI PM timer, because you have the PIIX4 bug.
That bug drops the ACPI PM timers rating to the same as the PIT, so
that's why you're getting the PIT.
Realistically, the PIT is much slower then even the triple read ACPI PM,
so the de-ranking code is probably dropping it too far.
Try this patch and let me know if it does the right thing. Although I do
still need to dig a bit on the PIT hang issue.

Don't drop ACPI PM quite so low if we see the PIIX4 bug.
