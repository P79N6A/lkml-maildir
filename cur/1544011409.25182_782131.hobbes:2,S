If a greedy module comes along and grabs all the channels via
dma_request_channel() then yes, there will be nothing left for the
public pool.  So, there is a requirement to "play nice".  If this
becomes an issue in practice we could add a DMA_NO_PRIVATE flag to
reserve a channel for public-only usage.
