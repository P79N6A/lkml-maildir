There are a lot changes between 2.6.15 and 2.6.17-mmX. Would you use
the single 2.6.17-mm5 kernel for benchmarking? It's easy:
        - select old readahead:
                echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/readahead_ratio
        - select new readahead:
                echo 50 > /proc/sys/vm/readahead_ratio
Thanks,
Wu
