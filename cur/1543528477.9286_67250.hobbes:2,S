Actually, 40% of my disk capacity is wasted  in duplicates. Why? I do
cp -a linux linux.backup before major changes. Automagicall ways to
get space back would be nice. (I also cp -a package ofic.package, so
that I can diff -ur later... Hardlinks are not enough because I do not
want to accidentaly trash ofic.)
So, I'd actually like cow-link. cp -a --cow-link mc ofic.mc would be
very usefull for me.
