the question comes back to looking if it's derived from the linux kernel.
if it is then it must be GPL (GPL doesn't allow anything else)
if it isn't then it can be becouse the GPL is compatable with BSD code.
(it becomes GPL for purposes of the kernel, but is also available for
other uses under the BSD license)
however the big question as always remains 'is this derived from the
kernel code'
