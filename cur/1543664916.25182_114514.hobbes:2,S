The apps I have vlc, and mpeg2dec (with mods) cannot read
multicast data under 2.5.63, but both work under 2.4.20.
I also have some PERL tools which do multicasting stuff and
they don't work any longer either.
However, I added 'eth0' to the IO::Socket::Multicast::mcast_add() 
call and now the data is showing up.
I believe this means back in the C/C++ paradigm you can't rely on
INADDR_ANY to do the right thing.  So you may have to set the
specific IP of the interface you want your multicast data to
come from in imr_interface.s_addr of the struct ip_mreq you pass
in via setsockopt( sock, IPPROTO_IP, IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, ...
I'll give this a try and let you know what I find.
