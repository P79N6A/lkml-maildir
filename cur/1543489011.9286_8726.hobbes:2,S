I didn't include the rest of your post in the interest of keeping the
thread manageable but I do appreciate your concerns Albert.  You are
correct in that it may be difficult to assess exactly what
'excellence' in the kernel is.
I was going to mention this in my previous note but I was worried
about length.  One of the reasons that we probably have spare cycles
available is the somewhat steep learning and development curve
associated with parallelizing applications.  I certainly understand
how seductive an arguement increased developer/programmer efficiency
is.
