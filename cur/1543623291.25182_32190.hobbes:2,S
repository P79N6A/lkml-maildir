I am always interested in more benchmarks, never ask this question :):)
A comparison between bcm5700 and tg3 would be interesting, for each new
release, if you were willing to do that.
And, what MTU are you using?  You may have answered this earlier and I
forgot :)  If you -are- on a gigabit network, then you [currently] must
manually enable an MTU of 9000 (jumbo frames).
