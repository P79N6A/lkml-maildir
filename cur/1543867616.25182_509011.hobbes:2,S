you choose to move to linux 2.6 for your next product - fine.
it has worked for you well in the past - fine.
you would like to keep along with the latest and greatest - fine.
_but_
for all those reasons you have to get along with all rules, licenses and
at least all changes that the kernel community decided to perform.

the trend is not worrying. we are not responsible for your decisions you made 
in the past. 
the only real FACT is that linux is being stated to BE OPEN and what is much more 
important to STAY OPEN for everybody.
you chose it years ago, because of those facts. of course linux is very popular on 
embedded systems. i am working within some open source projects that also run
on embedded hardware designs. 
your main mistake in understanding linux and our way to have it also more open in 
future than by now. 
what actually costs you more in future? 
opening your drivers, as much it must be, to have your hardware supported under 2.6
_or_ 
paying license fees for runtime/development tools for vxworks, ose whatever?
and what will do complain at windriver or other companies, if they decide not to support 
your used cpu architecture anymore?
this were my 0.2$

p.s. you said you like linux for its royalty model - that also includes that you accept all the
      other rules and terms. e.g. gpl license _and_ its fullfillment.
