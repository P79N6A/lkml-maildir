I was thinking about the cases where request_module's return
isn't checked... isn't this broken code and the calling code
should be checking < 0 and return'ing -ENODEV (or similar)?
Yes, it seems at least to a small extent rampant to request_module
and assume it works, but the more I think about it, those calls
should get fixed as they are broken code.
In this light, the macro approach is nice as the compiler warnings
help highlight these pieces of broken code so they can be fixed.
Thoughts?
