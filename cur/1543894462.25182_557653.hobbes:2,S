I am trying to reconcile your responses to those two paragraphs.
If the DRM signature and program executable are coupled such that they
are not useful when separated, the implication to me is that they form
one work that is based on the original Program.  This is beyond the
GPL's permission for "mere aggregation".
If they are one work, and the original Program was licensed under the
GPLv2, the combined work must also be licensed under the terms of the
GPLv2.
The input files required to generate a DRM-valid digital signature are
part the preferred form for modifying that work.
If those bits are not distributed along with the rest of the GPL'ed
work, the distributor is either not giving the same rights to the end
user, not distributing the source code for the work, or both.  Which
is it?
