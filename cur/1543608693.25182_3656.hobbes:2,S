chtrunk (
http://noid.sf.net/chtrunk.html
) can set up the namespace
dynamically for you. Instead of creating a complete system by hand and
run chroot, just run (you don't need to be root):
   chtrunk -s /bin /etc /lib /home/user -c program_to_run
This will give that program access to /bin, /etc, /lib and the home
directory, but nothing more.
You can use
   chtrunk -s /bin /etc /lib /home/user /tmp=/home/user/tmp -c program
to give every user their own private /tmp.
As a bonus, the suid/sgid bits will have no effect for these users,
which will prevent them from becoming root through buggy suid
programs.
