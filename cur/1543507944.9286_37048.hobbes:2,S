It looks like there is a bug in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-post.
in its present state it is invoking ifup-aliases if $ISALIAS is "no" !!
The ifup-aliases script in turn is invoking 
   linuxconf --hint ipalias <device>
which actually is generating these error messages.
Just change the following
if [ "$ISALIAS" = yes ] ; then
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-aliases ${DEVICE}
fi
to
if [ "$ISALIAS" = no ] ; then
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-aliases ${DEVICE}
fi
and you should be fine shape AFAIK.
