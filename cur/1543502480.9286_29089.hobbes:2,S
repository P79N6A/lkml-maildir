I don't think the packet scheduler would check for exact values when
scheduling packets, just compare them, so there is no need to use this
constant in the packet scheduler code.

Alexey just pointed out that the IFF_RUNNING setting is dangerous in
syncppp.c, so I'll have to find another way of reporting the status of the
link protocol. Btw, Alan, what you said about IFF_RUNNING earlier, does
this mean that it can't be done ?

Hmm... sorry, can't help you with this one. It should be related with your
board not reporting modem line status though. The driver should be
notified of modem line status changes and call at least sppp_reopen() when
the line changes to up. In my drivers I even call sppp_close() when the
line goes down and sppp_open() when it comes back.
