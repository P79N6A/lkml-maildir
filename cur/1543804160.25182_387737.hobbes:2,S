I don't think we should call printk()s "userspace interface". Yes,
someone may do dmesg | custom-grep-to-find-all-the-hardware, but
thats clearly stupid. I also believe that oops dump is so closely tied
to kernel that it is fair to change... plus this should better not be
configurable, or userspace will have hard time parsing it.
