MD> Actually, if you read the RFC 1122 section 3.2.1.3 you would indeed find that
MD> for you example you get
MD> Host-number = 0x02
MD> Subnet-number = 0x0000
MD> Network-number = 0x17
How come? It reads:
Q> We now summarize the important special cases for Class A, B,
Q> and C IP addresses, using the following notation for an IP
Q> address:
Q>
Q>{ <Network-number>, <Host-number> }
Q>or
Q>{ <Network-number>, <Subnet-number>, <Host-number> }
No room for class number so the class number is contained in the netowrk
number. The following paragraph also says this indirectly:
Q> The <Network-number> is administratively assigned so that
Q> its value will be unique in the entire world.
So the can't be two 1's in different classes.
