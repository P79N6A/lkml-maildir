Subject: [PATCH] i386: run BIOS PCI detection before direct
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/16/315

from 2.6.16-rc3-mm1 through at least 2.6.16-rc6-mm1 a patch from
Andi Kleen, titled
        x86_64-i386-pci-ordering.patch
which is now called:
	gregkh-pci-pci-give-pci-config-access-initialization-a-defined-ordering.patch
has caused a 4-way PIII Xeon (non-NUMA) to stop detecting its SCSI
card.  I believe this is also the issue keeping -mm from booting
on "elm3b67" from 
http://test.kernel.org/.
 
The following patch reverts the ordering of the PCI detection code
to always run the BIOS initialization, first.  As far as I can
tell, this was the original behavior, and it makes my machine boot
again.
