I went thru the POSIX specification and couldn't find any specified limits
regarding this and in most cases these limits are enforced at the library
level.  It probably should be left up to the kernel folks to determine the
kernel limits they can live with.  The library can adapt to this value.  I
don't believe a pthread library would need any "extra" control of how the
signal is delivered.  A file descriptor is good enough, seems a waste to
have to provide a sys_call interface.
