Hi Ryan,
First, whenever sending mail about the -rt patch, always CC Ingo (and
perhaps Thomas Gliexner and myself).
On Tue, 20 Jun 2006, Ryan McAvoy wrote:

2.6.15 had lots of problems with -rt.  Mainly the patch went through some
major rework, and Ingo was busy getting mutexes into mainline.  So the
2.6.15-rtX was sort of neglected.  It would be best to use 2.6.16-rtX and
maybe even 2.6.17-rtX
Which also comes the question: Which -rt patch are you actually trying?

That's a bug.  It should enable it not disable it.

Yep, try the following patch: (completey untested since I don't have a
mips machine).
