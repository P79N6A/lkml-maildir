Can we give him feedback now, asking him to put it back?

I've stopped even TRYING to patch bash.  try a for loop calling "echo $$&", 
eery single process bash forks off has the PARENT'S value for $$, which is 
REALLY annoying if you spend an afternoon writing code not knowing that and 
then wonder why the various process's temp file sare stomping each other...
Oh, and anybody who can explain this is welcome to try:
lines=`ls -l | awk '{print "\""$0"\""}'`
for i in $lines
do
  echo line:$i
done

Explain please?
The patches-linus-actuall-applies mailing list idea is based on how Linus 
says he works: he appends patches he likes to a file and then calls patch -p1 
< thatfile after a mail reading session.  It wouldn't be too much work for 
somebody to write a toy he could use that lets him work about the same way 
but forwards the messages to another folder where they can go out on an 
otherwise read-only list.  (No extra work for Linus.  This is EXTREMELY 
important, 'cause otherwise he'll never touch it.)
The advantage of this way is:
1) We know who sent the patches.  (We get the message with the "from" headers 
intact.)
2) Patch mails have descriptions in them most of the time, at least saying 
why, if not what they do.
3) This way, we know (more or less in realtime) that Linus has gotten a patch 
and applied it to his tree.  (What version and everything.)  It may be backed 
out again later, but we could give him another tool that can do that and 
notify the list...
This way, no mucking about with version control, no extra work for Linus, and 
in fact he doesn't have to worry about keeping track of what patches he's 
applied and when because he has a place he can go check if he forgets.
Now everybody tell me why this won't work. (Sure, all at once, why not...)
