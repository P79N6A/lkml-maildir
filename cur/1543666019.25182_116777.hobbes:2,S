If I understand you correctly, no. We have the boundary at EIP.
Decoding what's before is max 7-8 tries by a human and one can figure
out the real code from the context (with high probability). 2-3 times
more code before EIP then after could significantly help of course.

This approach frequently fails because vmlinux is on a users computer
far away and he
  1) doesn't bother answering anymore
  2) recompiled with different .config
  3) reinstalled another distro
  4) etc

The kernel shouldn't do it, it's not disassembler. It should just give
enough data for a human and disassembler. Nothing lost but much can be
gain.
