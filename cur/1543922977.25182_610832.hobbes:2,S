There isn't any hard semantics behind what is marked EXPERIMENTAL and 
what not. In it's current state, we could even consider removing the 
EXPERIMENTAL option and all dependencies on EXPERIMENTAL.
Currently CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL=n would cost a distribution a three digit 
number of device drivers plus several features like e.g. NFSv4.
