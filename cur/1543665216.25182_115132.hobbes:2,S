Wait, this sounds like a conversation with the Mafia:
"Pay us protection money."
"Why do we need to pay you for protection?"
"So we can protect you from criminals like ourselves."
I'd rather solve this problem by making standalone spelling fixes and
other cosmetic changes taboo.  Cosmetic changes combined with actual
useful code changes are fine with me.  If you're risking breaking the
build, there should be some benefit that justifies the risk.
Consider this a vote against standalone spelling/typo patches.
