Sure I hear that. But I posted an earlier question about QLA2200 and a
PV 660F and not seeing > 8 luns with 2.4.19-pre10.

I'll take a look at that, and see if I can merge it into -aa4.

This would be a DELL device, so I'll see about changing it from
SPARESLUN to LARGELUN?

There's nothing to post from /proc/scsi/scsi or the syslog other than
there's no more than 8 devices on my FC chain. I guess the real point
here is that if you're using FC, you're probably going to use more than
8 luns, even if not immediately. Especially for large Databases.

That makes sense I'll post to that list immediately and see what I can
get. Sorry for the confusion.
