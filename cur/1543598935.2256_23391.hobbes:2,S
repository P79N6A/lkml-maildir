You just pointed out the problem. Linus being the only trusted committer
for more than 100 MB of source base as he was for less than 1 MB 10 years
ago. And our single committer got some other loads as he has a job,
children, a boss, a mother-in-law :), may-be pets, etc...
The fact that Linux has great success does not mean that Linus is right on
the way he wants the kernel maintainance to proceed. It just means that he
hasn't been too wrong on this point, in my opinion. :-)
