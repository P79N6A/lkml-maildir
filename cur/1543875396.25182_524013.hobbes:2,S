All of this is actually the upper, fuse filesystem (maybe except the
filemap/page-writeback parts, which could be argued to belong to the
lower, ext3 filesystem).
Above the line is the kernel part, below the line is the userspace
part.

Not really ;)  One of the goals of fuse is to not restrict the
filesystem daemon in any way.  There are zillions of ways to work
around this deadlock, but I don't even want to make it even
theoretically possible.

OK.
