In the new radeon driver at hotplug time a user space app reads the
DDC from the monitor and sets the list of valid modes into the driver.
The radeon driver includes an I2C driver. The eeprom driver finds the
radeon DDC ROMs and makes them visible to the userspace driver through
sysfs. I could add code to the radeon driver to export the DDC ROMs to
sysfs but the eeprom driver works fine.
I don't want to load the driver from the script because the radeon
driver is creating a sysfs link into the eeprom directory from the
radeon one.
