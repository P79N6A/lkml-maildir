I've looked at e_powersaver sources and noticied the second test in
init function (after checking for CPU model) - it fails on this very
test:
  if (!cpu_has(c, X86_FEATURE_EST))
     return -ENODEV;
(this is one of first things I did when turning the mobo on - tried
various options including CPU frequency scaling, observed it doesn't
work and tried to understand why, but didn't went much further here
because of the SIGSEGV problem which is much more serious... ;)
/proc/cpuinfo does not have "eps" (nor "est") flags:
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : CentaurHauls
cpu family      : 6

Yeah, good idea.. thanks! ;)
