	smsc_ircc_look_for_chips won't re-register the devices
configured via PnP, as smsc_ircc_present won't be able to request the
region. So, I don't see the problem. And you could imagine having
multiple SMSC in the box, some PnP, some not.
	Note that we could put the region check earlier, but I like
the fact that the driver is still able to probe completely the chip
even if the serial driver has grabbed the regions. Maybe we could
split the difference and request the FIR region early on (so to fail
on SMC devices already registered) and request the other ressources
late (so as to completely probe even when serial is loaded).

	No, it was more that I don't understand what PnP does for
us. I don't have a SMS chipset to test on. Also, I would like to know
if it remove the need of smcinit.
	Thanks, have fun...
