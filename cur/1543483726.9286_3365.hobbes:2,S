That's not a good patch, unfortunately - it's a dirty hack - I know, I
used the exact same thing to verify the problem with Ingo last
Thursday/Friday.
Ingo Molnar posted a patch (which I helped him with) to the linux-kernel
mailing list today, which fixes this problem in the correct way. I have
the same motherboard as yours, so I can assure you it does work.
Cheers,
Alex
