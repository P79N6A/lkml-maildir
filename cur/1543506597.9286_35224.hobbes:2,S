Sam,
We have two Dell Poweredge 6300's with 2gig of memory in each, running
Linux.  The motherboard supports up to 4gig .. They are Xeon based systems,
and MySQL runs just perfect on them...
It would be nice to be able to take advantage of 4gig (w/out the current
problems of the kernel vs program memory space).. (even better ... it would
be nice to have multi-threading capabilities ... heh, I'm backing away from
that one .. slowly .. turning around .. not saying anything .. not expecting
anything ;)
Anyway .. there's an example of more than 1gig usage, and where 4gig would
be nice .. but, 2gig is just fine
Terry
