	This is not needed for SI_SIGIO. It is not generated from
the kernel. It seems this interface is already obsoleted.

	Yes, for every code generated from kernel. The others are
in __SI_KILL group. I see, __SI_CODE is fixed in your patch. Very good.
There are some unused groups (__SI_RT) but I can't find descriptions
or comments. Is it "Real Time" ? Hm.
