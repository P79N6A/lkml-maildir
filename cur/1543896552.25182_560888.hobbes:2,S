Exactly: We cannot get a regression free or even bug free kernel.
But we could handle the reported regressions (or even the reported bugs) 
better than we do.
Lesson #6:
Get the data.
Some real life numbers from 2.6.21 development:
- 80 days between 2.6.20 and 2.6.21
- 98 post-2.6.20 regression have been reported before 2.6.21 was released
- 15 open post-2.6.20 regression reports at the time of the 2.6.21 release
- 8 open post-2.6.20 regression reports at the time of the 2.6.21 release
    that were reported at least 3 weeks before the 2.6.21 release
This:
- only includes regressions with reasonably usable reports [1] and
- confirmed to be regressions and
- reported by the relatively small number (compared to the complete
  number of Linux users) of -rc testers and
- reported before the release of 2.6.21.
We weren't even able to handle all reported recent regressions in 
2.6.21, and for other bugs our numbers won't be better.
When Dave Jones says that for a kernel for a new RHEL release that is 
based on a "stable" upstream kernel they spend 3 months only for shaking 
out bugs in the kernel that's IMHO a good description of our "stable" 
kernels.
I'm not claiming the kernel could become bug-free, but aiming at being 
able to handle all incoming bug reports is IMHO a worthwhile and not 
completely unrealistic goal with benefits for all Linux users (and the 
overall image of Linux).
Currently, we are light years away from this goal.
