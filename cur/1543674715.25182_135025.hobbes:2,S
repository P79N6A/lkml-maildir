Did you install the generated modprobe.conf in /etc? If not, do so.
rc.sysinit has a known problem that causes it to disable module
autoloading in 2.5 kernels. Fixed by the patch below.
mkinitrd generally doesn't work with 2.5 modules, or once the new
module-init-tools have been installed. I don't know how to fix
that; maybe an LKML archive search will find something.
