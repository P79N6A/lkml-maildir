The attached patch shows up three places where sleep_on_interruptible() is
used unsafely. I think it would be useful to include it at least briefly to
locate other abusers.
One could cause kswapd to miss wake-ups, which is not fatal but hardly 
ideal. (mm/vmscan.c:604)
One could cause a user to miss events which arrive just as they're trying 
to read /proc/sys/acpi/event (drivers/acpi/driver.c:162)
The third could cause the acpi thread to fail to wake up and service a
queued task (drivers/acpi/driver.c:333)
