No. No "either". 
Drivers need to be safe from the hw going away, whether it be physically 
or because it got shut down.

No.
Freeing irq's DOES NOT HELP.
Listen to me. You need the hardening of the driver anyway for the hotplug 
case. Freeing irq's doesn't do anything for it, it's just shuffling the 
real problem under the carpet.
So fix the damn problem _right_, and suddenly freeing the irq doesn't make 
any difference at all. It's just unnecessary and incorrect complexity.
