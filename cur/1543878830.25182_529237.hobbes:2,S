Subject: [PATCH] Improve heuristic detecting sequential reads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hello!
  In thread 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/9/403,
 we discussed a problem
with the current heuristic for detecting sequential IO in
do_generic_mapping_read() - for small files a page is marked as accessed
only once which can cause a performance problems.
  Attached is a patch that improves the heuristic by introducing a
ra.offset variable so now we can reliably detect sequetial reads.
The patch replaces Nick's patch from 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/15/177
(Nick has acked to replace the patch). Could you please put the patch
into -mm?
							Bye

Introduce ra.offset and store in it an offset where the previous read ended. This way
we can detect whether reads are really sequential (and thus we should not mark the page
as accessed repeatedly) or whether they are random and just happen to be in the same page
(and the page should really be marked accessed again).
