How can a union file system with a decent set of useful semantics be 
fully implemented at the VFS layer in a "clean" manner?
For instance, a major use of unionfs is live CDs, namely unionfs w/ a 
read-only and read-write layer.  Unionfs enables files to be copied up 
from the read-only layer to the read-write layer.
Does one really want to implement "copyup" in the VFS?
just my 2 agarot.
