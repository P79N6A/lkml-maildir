1) It had unfixable races  (The device is created when the hardware  
is detected but the module isn't loaded yet so the device doesn't work?)
2) The maintainer stopped maintaining it
3) It put naming policy (and a bad one at that) in the kernel where  
it doesn't belong.
I'm sure there are more, but those are the basic ones.
Cheers,

Somone asked me why I work on this free (

philosophy/) software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Schulz  
had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."
