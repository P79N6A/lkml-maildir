.I  hope you have some time to answer these probably simple questions, if
not I apologize for taking  up your time :)
I have tried to compile the wdt.c driver  distributed with RedHat Linux 6.0
When I compile this or any of my own device drivers that uses  device_open
and so on.
I always get " struct file declared inside parameter list" , "struct inode
declared inside parameter list"
and "excess elements in initzialiser after fops"
It doesnt seem to matter how I write the fops list, I have check all the
exampels on the net and "Linux Device Drivers" by O'reiley and several net
documents like  "writing Linux device drivers".
I can easily compile and ismod a driver that doesnt use fops or IOCTL.
There is probably a simple solution to all this, i would be very gratefull
if you could help me out!
I am writing a driver that needs to read a few IO adresses (I know how to
implement it of course)  and it will then be "read" by a deamon that wil
write the
data to /PROC.
Best Regards
