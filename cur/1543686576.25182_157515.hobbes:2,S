I do not see the point in this.
Kconfig should treat this as a block of text - like the help section.
Only action to take is to:
1: Find all symbols enclosed in $()
	a: Check that it exists
	b: Append CONFIG_
Then Kconfig in each directory should generate a Kconfig.make file,
that will be included when kbuild reaches that directory.

If using the above syntax - where do you see the rules being translated
to makefile syntax?
kbuild could do this - yes. But I do not see the point in having
the extra abstraction layer. Maybe you have something in mind I have
not envisioned?
