I understand.  It's OK to piss off one Sparc64 Linux user, but if you
piss off both of them, you're in trouble 8)
I was actually proposing to provide a patch to an egcs version of your
choice which you could provide as kgcc to your users.  But RH seem to
have taken down the SRPM for 2.92.11 (egcs64-19980921-4.src.rpm).
