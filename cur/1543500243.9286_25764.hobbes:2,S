Long ago, in 2.0.twenties I had a dual Pentium II 266 sitting in an
un-air-conditioned room in July in 90 F weather.  I was logged into
the machine remotely when everything got REALLY slow... the shell
was unresponsive, things like ps took 10 seconds.  The load was 
0.00.  
I looked through syslog and messages to find an OOPS on CPU1.
CPU0, though, was still chugging along.  I'm not sure if the kernel
started scheduling processes only on CPU0, or if new ones just went
there, but the system was still running enough to be cleanly shut
down.  
I drove home from work, pulled the case off the machine, and 
a wave of heat just poured out.  I rebooted with better ventilation 
(no case cover) and saw the BIOS had detected the core temperature of 
one of the chips to be near 120 F.  They usually run near 90 F.
I've since never had a problem with the machine, since I've 
got 9 fans in it now, but I was still impressed how a kernel which
wasn't supposed to be that good at SMP handled the situation.
