Hello,
What is the current status of IDE Hot Swap, in terms of any necessary
kernel support?  As far as I can see, this was last discussed here in
March, when Andre Hedrick indicated he had some preliminary, unreleased
code to do this.
The hardware I am thinking of would be a run-of-the-mill ATA/100
controller, a run-of-the-mill ATA/100 drive, and a hot swap bay such as
the Promise SuperSwap (
http://www.promise.com/PDF/sswapds.pdf
) or the
RyAim KF-21-IPF (
http://www.ryaim.com/products/accessory/kf21.htm
).  One
possible application would be using an IDE drive as a removable backup
device (allowing off-site storage).
Cheers, Wayne
