The unlock_kernel() is fine.  The kernel will drop the
lock for us as the task makes its final call to schedule()
on its way to the process graveyard, but it's neater this way.

I've always put the reparent_to_init() call after the daemonize()
call.  I don't immediately see anything wrong with doing it
beforehand, but that is a less tested code sequence.
But yes, you're right - kjournald needs to call reparent_to_init(),
else it'll turn into a zombie if the process which mounted the
filesystem is still running.
Could you please move the reparent_to_init() down a line and send
a diff to Marcelo?
Thanks.
