Do you have any references for this claim?  I have never seen one that
panned out (at least not since the high-end-10mbps days).
Just to be clear, I am asking for an example of a Gigabit Ethernet
switch that supports cut-through switching.  I contend that there is no
such beast commercially available today.
(It would be even more interesting if it could switch 9000-octet jumbo
frames, too.)
I'm sure someone is going to point me to a $10,000/port monster, and
while that's not very feasible for my needs, it would still be
interesting.
