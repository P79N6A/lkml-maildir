I can't, because I (plan to) use this kernel on many different machines. Not
all of those (in fact: only one) uses the amd74xx module.
Is there a kernel parameter I can use to disable the generic IDE code on
boot?
I already tried compiling without CONFIG_BLK_DEV_GENERIC, which doesn't
help.
Thanks!
