I saw your patch and the related discussion...
But I am thinking that filtering in userspace based on pid/tid
could be too much overhead when the data that I am interested
in might be just a small fraction of the whole thing...
I was hoping to add a flag (similar to IN_ATTRS that you have added)
which, when used, will only collect events for the calling
process and it's children...
