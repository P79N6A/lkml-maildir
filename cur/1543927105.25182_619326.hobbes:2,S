Subject: [PATCH] x86: correctly set UTS_MACHINE for "make ARCH=x86"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Upon request I have updated the patch description
and hope it is now more explanatory.
IMHO this should go into 2.6.24.
BTW, the patch was tested with v2.6.24-rc3-19-g2ffbb83.
Regards,
Andreas

x86: correctly set UTS_MACHINE for "make ARCH=x86"
For a kernel built with "make ARCH=x86" the following system
information is displayed when running the new kernel
    $ uname -m
    x86
On some i386 systems (e.g. K7) we even have the following information
    $ uname -m
    x66
This is weird. The usual information for "uname -m" should be "x86_64"
on 64-bit and "i386" or "i686" on 32-bit.
This patch fixes the issue by setting UTS_MACHINE to "i386" for 32-bit
kernel builds and to "x86_64" for 64-bit kernel builds. I.e., "x86"
won't be used for UTS_MACHINE anymore.
