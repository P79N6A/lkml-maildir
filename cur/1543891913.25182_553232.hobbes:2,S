Note that sched_clock() can not be used early on ARM; it might want to
access MMIO which is not accessible until later in setup_arch().  This
is why ARM's printk_clock() divorces itself from sched_clock().

If it's ends up being based upon sched_clock() instead of printk_clock()
on ARM then it'll break stuff horribly (== non-bootable kernels.)
