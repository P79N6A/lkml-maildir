i think both activities fit the generic 'embedded/specialized kernel' term 
quite well, so i dont think there's a big naming problem. There's maybe a 
documentation problem - the help text could be improved some more to 
signal that certain specialized config options are only available under 
CONFIG_EMBEDDED.
