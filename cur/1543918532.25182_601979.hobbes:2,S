It's two constant-indexed dereferences *in total*, compared to a
single constant-indexed dereference in the pre-cgroup case.
The cpuset pointer is found at
task->cgroups->subsys[cpuset_subsys_id], where cpuset_subsys_id is a
compile-time constant.

Sounds reasonable.

I didn't notice any performance hit on a pure allocate/free memory
benchmark relative to non-cgroup cpusets. (There was a small
performance hit relative to not using cpusets at all, but that was to
be expected).
