I disagree with Albert on this one: it should be "released".  We're
not announcing a projected event, but an achieved one.  Announcements
of expected future events are routinely round-filed.
> * Strong 256-bit encryption, uncompromised by US export restrictions, is

This is too much detail.  Delete the last sentence, or (if not) change
"protects" to "can protect", and maybe still delete "including swap
space".
 
> * Enterprise-level network filesystem support, with data replication for

Hyphens, again: "file-server" is the correct adjectival phrase
preceding the noun "destruction".

That word "seamlessly" still screams "flim-flam!".  We don't need to 
snow anybody, we've got the real goods.  Let's replace "enables ... to 
seamlessly handle" with "gives ... full access to".

I like the above much better than anything I've seen earlier, including my
own suggestion.  Good work!

I'd like to see "breathe new life" here -- or better, replace the sentence
with something more meaningful:
  It can also make older machines--even 386-based computers--useful
  again.

Why "cost-effective" and not "free"?  Why "contracts"?
I suggest:
  Support is readily available from distribution vendors and a variety
  of service companies, besides the free Internet newsgroups.
Looking good!
