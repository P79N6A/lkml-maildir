I'm talking about "local" addresses.
When we're routing, we'll use an interface address of
course.
But when the packet is originating from our host, and
the source address in the outgoing packet is local to
us, we will use it as the source in the ARP packet.
Look at the algorithm in net/ipv4/arp_solicit() to see
what I mean.
