I've got a similar problem with a  RTL-8139 (rev 10) ( 8139too.c )
Apr 17 22:53:12 skippy kernel: eth1: Too much work at interrupt,
IntrStatus=0x0040.
The maintenair of this module writes that's a RxFIIFO Overflow that have
probably no other issue than buying a new processor :)
But .. I didn't have this messages on pre - 2.4.3 kernels .. ( neither on
2.4.3ac7 )
