The point is - _verifying_ that is actually hard.
If some inline function depends on a particular header, you'll have a hard 
time checking for that if there's an #ifdef around it. Which is not 
uncommon, we have things like:
	#ifdef CONFIG_PROCFS
	.. number of inline functions ..
	#else
	#define function1(a,b,c) do { } while (0)
	...
	#endif
so I'm just saying that "just compile it" is _not_ a way of verifying that 
the header file is complete - because it may well be complete for the 
particular config you're testing, but not for some other.
So this is a hard problem. If it was easy, we'd not _have_ the problem in 
the first place.
