So "tied" means "nobody has yet needed to create a different API for
that subset of the mechanism"?  Still can't agree.  Nothing's preventing
anyone from creating such an API, if they need to.

They shouldn't.  That's the point of having this in the driver model:
so that all wakeup-capable devices can/will act the same in terms of
the basic capability and policy.
(Of course, there are ugly PPC/OF-only enumeration issues that keep us
from kicking in the wakeup mechanisms for PCI devices.  But that's a
separate issue, specific to PCI ... although it sucks hugely, since
so few developers have non-PCI wakeup-capable devices.)

Well, as was said previously:  For UHCI it's not "just" a PM mechanism.
