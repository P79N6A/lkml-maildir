 Although everything else you said was right, you can do some damage
control in the above situation.
 Basically...
#ifdef HAVE_SIGALTSTACK
 do
 {
  struct sigaltstack alt_stack;
  static char buffer[SIGSTKSZ];
  
  alt_stack.ss_size = SIGSTKSZ;
  alt_stack.ss_sp = buffer;
  alt_stack.ss_flags = 0;
  if (sigaltstack(&alt_stack, NULL) == -1)
  { /* this should be impossible */
    /* **** log error **** */
   break;
  }
  sa.sa_flags |= SA_ONSTACK;
 } while (FALSE);
#endif
 sa.sa_handler = internal_signal_crash;
 if (sigaction(SIGSEGV, &sa, NULL) == -1)
   /* **** log error **** */ ;
 ...etc. for SIGBUS etc.
 Again as alan said your _system_ still needs to recover from someone
pulling the power (just fitting a UPS doesn't count as they fail too),
but you should still do stuff like the above and check error codes on
read()/close()/malloc()[1].
 All in my opinion.
[1] Some people may think the above is in priority order, you can
think that if you wish but I'll still do all of them.
