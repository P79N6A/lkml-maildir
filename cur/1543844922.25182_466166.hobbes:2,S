I'm not convinced. Certain workflows are more focused on how changes
change (sic) rather than on how the end product i.e. the sources change.
I am referring to reworking of patches during tests and reviews as well
as rewriting descriptions, collecting Acks and Sign-offs etc. while
maintaining a certain identity of the patch or series of patches.
But maybe I'm just not aware of how git may support this effectively.
Perhaps thusly: Let the young and wild times of life of a patch actually
result into many commits to a topic branch; collapse a lot of these
commits into one or few diffs for each review round; move to a new topic
branch for bigger reworks of the changeset; and finally collapse it into
one or few commits to a staging branch for submission? Sounds still more
like a job for patch-centered tools like quilt.
