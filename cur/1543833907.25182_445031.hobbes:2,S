I was afraid to use __put_user, but I guess it's OK?

This should at least stop the endless faults because recursive faulting
in die() is handled properly.  Right now the original error message
(incomplete but still possibly useful) scrolls away.
I was going to fix handling of bad task pointer in die() and
show_registers() after I got feedback from the first patch.
