ioperm() does that already, no? You mean, you enable it for non-root,
too? That's security hole.

read/write on /dev/mem. chmod 666 /dev/mem if you want to allow normal
users to access physical memory (security hole, again).

That seems nice. Does it work with PCI shared interrupts?

Please post it to the list.
