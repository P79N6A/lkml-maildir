it's overhead that's rarely used, and worse, it suffers from the LSM disease:
it's a hook without visibility into the callers. Esp if there's only 1 user, a direct call
is not only faster, it also shows you what is going on when you're reading the code.
THe page fault stuff is tricky enough as it is without any "call arbitrary thing" hooks into
it

that's not per se mutually exclusive, there's other cases like this already
(but even then, I don't want to go through hoops to make mmiotracing a module;
for me I can totally see it becoming a full mature member of the kernel, and if
that means a few things have to be changed in the normal kernel, or infrastructure
added, I'm totally ok with that)

this is exactly the point.. it becomes a totally opaque thing, a random hook.
