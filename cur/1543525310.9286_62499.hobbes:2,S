It *is* SMP safe (or should be); all the synchronize_bh() calls are
done on module removal, to avoid a icky-to-solve race.
This module removal problem would be solved elegently by Alexey's
suggested module scheme, but for the moment, I'll just remove the
calls (ie. don't rmmod under SMP on heavy network traffic).

Yeah yeah I know.  But NAT control interface sucks badly, and I wanted
to fix it first.  Got a little... distracted... writing tests and all
that software engineering shit.
TODO looks vaguely like:
	Finish ipnatctl removal (ie. 0.90 branch of netfilter modules).
	Put conntrack field in skb.
	Merge James Morris's netlink-to-userspace patch.
	Add more cursing.
	Merge with official kernel.
	Sleep
	Document
	Shitload of testing.
There's some random code-neating in there, too.
Does that sound ok?
Rusty.
