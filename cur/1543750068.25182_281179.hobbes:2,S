In addition to this book, another one that I have found to be an
excellent source is, Understanding the Linux Kernel.  There's a second
edition available now here:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596002130/ref=pd_qpt_gw_2/103-9996868-5870242
 and I imagine that another will be released in the not too distance
future, which will cover the 2.6 kernel.  It wouldn't surprise me if
somebody here is inside information on a new edition.
Good luck,
