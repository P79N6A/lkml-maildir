OMFG!
How can you *not* point to the /boot/vmlinuz symlink?!!!  It points directly
to the latest kernel. And, /boot/vmlinuz.old points to the previous kernel.
Here are some examples:  This is *just too simple*!!!
Lilo:
image=/boot/vmlinuz
	label=vmlinuz
	read-only
#	restricted
	alias=1
image=/boot/vmlinuz.old
	label=vmlinuz-old
	read-only
	optional
	append="single"
#	restricted
	alias=3
Grub:
title           Debian GNU/Linux, Latest Kernel
root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1 ro vga=extended
title           Debian GNU/Linux, Latest Kernel (recovery mode)
root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1 ro single vga=extended
title           Debian GNU/Linux, Previous Kernel
root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz.old root=/dev/hda1 ro vga=extended
title           Debian GNU/Linux, Previous Kernel (recovery mode)
root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz.old root=/dev/hda1 ro single vga=extended
