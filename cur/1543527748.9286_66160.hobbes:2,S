   Run 'nm vmlinux' with the sort-by-size argument.  Guess what the
   biggest objects in the entire kernel are?  The dentry and inode
   hash table base arrays...
   Unless there is hidden stuff, a nice fix for this would be to make
   their allocation dynamic at the beginning of fs_init() or somesuch.
Yes, and they should be dynamically sized too.
The dentry hash table is done dynamically in 2.2.x already, so
you can just backport that.  The inode hash table should be
trivial to do.
Later,
