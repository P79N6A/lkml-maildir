The limit *per L1 Page Table Base Pointer*, that is.  You could
in theory have a different L1 Page Table base pointer for each
task (including each proc 0 in linux).  You can also pull a few
tricks such as instantiating a 4 GB kernel virtual address space
while in kernel mode (using a virtual windowing mechanism as is used
for high mem today to map in user space for copying in data from
user space if/when needed).  The latter takes some tricky code to
get mapping correct but it wasn't a lot of code in PTX.  Just needed
a lot of careful thought, review, testing, etc.
I don't know if there are real examples of large memory systems
exhausting the ~1 GB of kernel virtual address space on machines
with > 12-32 GB of physical memory (we had this problem in PTX which
created the need for a larger kernel virtual address space in some
contexts).

Would be nice to have a config option like "CONFIG_PCI_36" to imply
that all devices on a PAE system were able to access all of memory,
globally removing the need for bounce buffering and allowing a native
PCI setup for mapping memory addresses...
