   Don't forget that 2^20 > 10^6, hence if you really want units of
   microseconds, you actually only need to save 3 bytes worth of data per
   timestamp.
   For the purposes of NFS, however the 'microseconds' field doesn't
   actually have to mean anything. It's just used as a cookie.
   Furthermore, only the mtime field, and to a limited extent the ctime
   field, are used for attribute consistency checking.
So this is a really stupid question, but I'll ask it anyway.  If you
just need a cookie, is there any way that you might be able to steal a
few bits from i_generation field for that purpose?  (This assumes that
we only worry about solving the problem for NFS.)
