Thank you for the suggestion.  I don't see much in /var/log/messages 
(syslogd is running).  There are 3326 lines taking up about 256 kB 
there, and when I run hdparm runs no further messages are generated.
I don't have anything attached to the serial port at the moment.  Could 
that cause problems?  I'm going to attach something and see what 
happens.  Other advice is still welcome.
