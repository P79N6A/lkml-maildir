i have such a routine called writer_bottomhalf. Is my bh function.
DECLARE_TASKLET(writer_tasklet,writer_bottomhalf,(unsigned
long)&status);
in write() function:
static ssize_t eib_write(struct file *file, const char *buf, size_t
count, loff_t *offset){
	//adding header, checksum and ending character to the user data
	tasklet_schedule(&writer_bottomhalf);
	return bytes_read_from_user_space;
}
in writer_bottomhalf() function:
static void writer_bottomhalf(unsigned long data){
	if(bytes_send==writer_length){
	    //init timer to check for acks
	}
	else{
	    outb(writer[bytes_send], eib_io+UART_TX); //eib_io=0x03f8
	    printk(KERN_INFO"sending %x\n",writer[bytes_send]);
       }
}
in ISR function:
static void interrupt_handler(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs
*regs){
	//do stuff for other interrupts
	if ( inb(  eib_io + UART_LSR ) & ( UART_LSR_THRE) ){
		bytes_send++;
		tasklet_schedule(&writer_bottomhalf);
	}
}
so i call my bh function from my write() and from my ISR routines.
is their any difference if this routine is a bh or a plain routine as
long as they execute the same code?

in the init_module function i do:
outb( UART_LCR_DLAB | UART_LCR_WLEN8 | UART_LCR_PARITY | UART_LCR_EPAR ,
eib_io + UART_LCR );      //dlab =1  serial init for 8E1
outb(0X06,eib_io+UART_DLL);  //speed set to 19200
outb(0X00,eib_io+UART_DLM);
outb(inb( eib_io + UART_LCR ) & ~UART_LCR_DLAB,eib_io+UART_LCR);	//unset
dlab
outb( UART_IER_RLSI | UART_IER_RDI | UART_IER_THRI , eib_io
+UART_IER);     //enabling interrupts
i am an unexperienced programmer and my code is awful and buggy but i
can't understand why is working only in my computer and not to any other
x86 machine...? that's why i suspect the chipset manufacturer (maybe the
have the serial address port in another address and not in 0x03f8 or
smth like this)
