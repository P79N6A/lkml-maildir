I suggest you look into the memory settings in your BIOS, and change them
to the most conservative available.  Or, throw out your memory and buy
some from a reputable manufacturer.  Your problem is definitely hardware.
There are racks full of linux machines with more than 128 MB RAM running
kernel 2.4 all over the world.  I personally installed a dozen.  It always
works fine.
