I thought one of the earlier patches (Max's, perhaps) that we considered
in this discussion back in Feb or March -did- end up close to traveling
upstream, via the sched-devel tree going into linux-next, or some such.
However I can't claim to understand what (almost) went down there as
well as Andrew or Stephen hopefully do.

Well, yeah, everyone wants "simple".  But that tends to degrade into
each of us insisting that whatever we don't appreciate need for in the
other guys proposal be removed.  That way lies not progress.
