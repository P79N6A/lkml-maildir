There are two things here: a) identifying the device and b) putting it into
the correct place in the various data structures.  I suspect these can (and
should) be separated out.
For a), the current kernel behaviour is what we want - make the thing
appear at a new place in the namespace and in the hierarchy.  Then
userspace can do whatever needs to be done to identify the device, and
apply some sort of policy decision to the result.
It's what comes next that we're missing: the ability for userspace to tell
the krnrel what the decice's naming and positioning _should_ be.  The
kernel will then atomically tear down what it currently has and will then
set everything up as desired.
