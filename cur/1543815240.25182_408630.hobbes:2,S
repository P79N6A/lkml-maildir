Does this replace any of your pre-existing msi patches in my tree (and
in -mm)?  Shouldn't you just merge a few of them together now so that if
someone were to apply stuff in order, the build is not broken for any
step along the patch trail?
And also, the Makefile should be changed as Matthew pointed out.
So, care to redo this?
thanks,
