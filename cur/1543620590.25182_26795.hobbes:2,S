Can you sleep if acquired as the spinlock?
Is there any measurable (or at least plausible reason why there should be)
performance improvement? (No, "should make preemptible kernel faster"
doesn't cut it at all for me). Or any hope that it will substantially
simplify kernel programming with _no_ performance degradation by replacing
both semphores and spinlocks?
