Very few programs do controlled cleanup & exit today, those that do will do
so regardless. And if they run OOM (due to overcommitment that can't be
met, user quota, rlimit, system isn't overallocating and ran out, or
whatever), they won't be able to do anything much about it anyway.

Where it counts, it will have been implemented. In any case, it will rarely
have any huge impact. Most programs don't use sophisticated data structures,
even less are able to cleanly distinguish between essential and
non-essential (doing so is _much_ extra programmer effort, for no gain when
the resources are available, and little if they aren't (it will mostly mean
memory will definitely run out somewhat later)).
