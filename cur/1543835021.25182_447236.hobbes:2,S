Sorry for my stupid question, but could you tell me why starting to make 
incompatible changes to reiserfs3 now (when reiserfs3 "technology" is 
rather old) and making reiserfs3 unstable (again), possibly for several 
months or even years is better than fixing big issues with reiser4 (if 
there are any really big left) merging it and trying to stabilize it?
For end user both ways will result in mkfs so...
Thanks,
