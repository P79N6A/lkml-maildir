That's easy to explain. Andrea's latest aa contains some low latency
patches, which add a if (current->need_resched) schedule() to copy*user
to avoid bad schedule latencies for big copies. The result is that you
see a lot more schedules, everytime the copy*user happens to hit the
end of a time slice.
BTW, there is a another optimization that could help reiserfs a lot 
on SMP settings: do a unlock_kernel()/lock_kernel() around the user 
copies. It is quite legal to do that (you have to handle sleeping
anyways in case of a page fault), and it allows CPUs to run in parallel
for long running copies.
