Clearly it requires a CoW break and swapping out that page won't free any 
memory directly, but it will in turn allow the cache page to be dropped.  I 
suppose your point is that these ideas touch the system in a lot of places, 
and right now the code is a little too irregular to withstand lathering on a 
new layer of cruft.  That's true, but <plug>the reverse mapping work 
enables some fundamental VM simplifications that make a lot of things more 
local, and so a better base for these new, sophisticated features is on its 
way.</plug>

It is good sport, but the real benefits are compelling and will only get more 
so.  For high end scientific uses (read supercomputing clusters) it's a cinch 
developers will prefer high speed file operations that turn in nearly the 
same raw performance on large transfers as O_DIRECT while not bypassing the 
file cache.
