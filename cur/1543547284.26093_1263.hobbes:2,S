Hugh? kernel image is not neccessarily accessible from running system.
Example 1: machine booted from ethernet.
Example 2: velo where I boot from wince and vmlinux is lost in
process.
I may have other problems, but config.gz would still be nice. (And:
how do you detect what kernel image corresponds to currently running
kernel even on normal system?)
