Actually, we are using ext3 pretty much as-is for our backing-store
for Lustre.  The same is true of InterMezzo, and NFS, for that matter.
All of them live on top of a standard "local" filesystem, which doesn't
know the things that happen above it to make it a network filesystem
(locking, etc).
That isn't to say that I agree with just taking a local filesystem and
putting it on a shared block device and expecting it to work with only
the normal filesystem code.  We do all of our locking above the fs
level, but we do have some help in the VFS (intent-based lookup, patch
in the Lustre CVS repository, if people are interested).
Cheers, Andreas
