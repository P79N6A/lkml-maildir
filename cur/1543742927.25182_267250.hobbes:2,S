how can poll(2) be more complex than read/write? if it is, it
shouldn't be ;)

we don't really care which one needs attention "first". the jack process
cycle ends up consuming and producing data - 
      before the ALSA backend tells jackd to run the process cycle,
         it will read the data from the capture fd (though its done
	 using mmap, so there is no read(2) call)
      just before jackd goes back to sleep waiting for the next
         interrupt, the ALSA backend will write data to the playback fd
	 (again, using mmap, so there is no actual write(2) call)
it is important to use mmap - it avoids multiple kernel entries and
data copying. for consumer cards this doesn't matter much, but for
high end multichannel cards, the data copy would be inexcusable.
