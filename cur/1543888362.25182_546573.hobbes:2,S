Is the S.D. columns (immediately after the average) standard
deviation? If so, you may want to rename those 'stdev', as it's a
little confusing to have S.D. stand for that and Staircase Deadline.
Further, which standard deviation is it? (The standard deviation of
the values (stdev), or the standard deviation of the mean (sdom)?)
Finally, if it is the standard deviation (of either), then I don't
really believe those numbers for the glxgears case. The deviation is
huge for all but one of those results.
Regardless, it's good that you're doing measurements, and keep it up :-).
