I'm talking about 2.0.36 (which I forgot to mention, sorry), and this
line appears in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:
char x86_vendor_id[13] = "GenuineIntel";/* default */
And this IBM 486SLC machine reports:
processor       : 0
cpu             : 486
model           : 486 DX-25/33
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
stepping        : unknown
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : no
cpuid           : no
wp              : yes
flags           :
bogomips        : 18.94
It does indeed not have CPUID (too old); it generates SIGILL.
I know that machines that have CPUID will report their vendor correctly
(as does my AMD K6-2 box).
Incidentally, I'm also not sure what makes it decide that it's a 486
DX-25/33.  As I said, it's an SLC, and it's clocked at 66 MHz.  (It's
probably comparable in performance to a 486 DX/33-- is that what it's
trying to say? ;-)
A glance at semi-recent 2.1.x sources shows that this is all different,
so I believe you that 2.1/2.2 reports "unknown".  I'm wondering why
2.0.x shouldn't do the same; it makes so much more sense...
Thanks, in advance.
