How about the following approach, which MAY not be practical:
1. Name all of the new Makefiles Makefile.k2.5
2. Create a small wrapper script to define make as "make -f Makefile.k2.5"
   or just define MAKE as make -f Makefile.k2.5 in the top level Makefile.k2.5
Put the kbuild2.5 specific tools in a directory reserved for kbuild2.5
tools.
This should allow both build procedures to reside side by side. Use one
or the other, but don't mix them  (don't build the kernel using one,
then build the modules using the other, though that MIGHT work, it doesn't
have to). It may be necessary to have disjoint configure file names.
To switch between them should take a "make clean", then rename the wrapper
script. Dependant tools should reside in different directories to prevent
name collision. Common tools wouldn't change.
After everyone is happy with the new build procedures, the older one
could be retired. A clean-up patch could then rename the Makefiles and
fix any final targets, though I would favor just leaving that the same
as a pattern for future kbuild evoultion/revolution.
