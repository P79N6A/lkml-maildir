These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness. It is 
configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.

Split patches and a server specific patch available.
Added since 2.6.10-ck7:
+cfq-ts-21.diff
The latest version of Jens' cfq-timeslice i/o scheduler now heavily tested and 
with full read i/o priority support
+isobatch_ionice2.diff
Support for i/o priorities suitable for SCHED_ISO and SCHED_BATCH tasks
+rt_ionice.diff
Support for i/o priority suitable for real time tasks
Changed:
+schediso2.11.diff
The development of the 3.x series of Isochronous scheduling support did not 
reach full maturity and its features were no longer deemed desirable. This 
has a minor bugfix for the 2.10 version included previously instead.
+mapped_watermark3.diff
Finally I have tweaked the mapped watermark patch which makes for memory 
scanning to be progressively more aggressive the more stress/fragmentation it 
is under, to swap far less under all sorts of load (especially i/o load), yet 
not risk out-of-memory kills. 
Rolled up:
