I am experiencing deadlocks due a race in ___wait_on_page:
void ___wait_on_page(struct page *page)
{
	struct task_struct *tsk = current;
	DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, tsk);
	add_wait_queue(&page->wait, &wait);
	tsk->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
	run_task_queue(&tq_disk);
	if (PageLocked(page)) {
		do {
			tsk->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
			run_task_queue(&tq_disk);
			*** here must check if the page is locked before
			    go to sleep after we set the state to
			    task uninterruptible ***
			schedule();
		} while (PageLocked(page));
	}
	tsk->state = TASK_RUNNING;
	remove_wait_queue(&page->wait, &wait);
}
Here it is a fix for the race (against pre-9):

Then I had also a different trouble, I got this message on the
test-machine while logging out from rsh.
	hm, no brw_page(%p) because IO already started.
And after that obviously all tasks that tried to access the page
deadlocked (since the I/O got not started and the page was locked).
Now I changed the code to do:
[..]
	if (page->buffers)
		goto just_read;
[..]
	return 0;
 just_read:
	printk("hm, no brw_page(%p) because IO already started.\n", page);
	BUG();
	return 1;
Now I'll try to get a stack-trace.... (note: if I would had kdb compiled
into the kernel I wouldn't had to recompile, reboot, and try to reproduce
to get a stack trace). But don't take this report as a bug report of
pre-2.3.7-9 since I have so many page-cache differences in my tree that I
may have missed something as well. But if you know that the problem is
pre-2.3.7-9 specific I like to know :)). Thanks.
