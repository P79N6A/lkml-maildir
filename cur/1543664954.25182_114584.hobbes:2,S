Hmm, maybe it was somewhere else I wrote it then.

I certainly don't want that. I'd much rather see something
slightly similar to files in /proc/sys/. I only want the
write system call to work, and I don't want the write call
to make use of any file offset. (Maybe it would require a
buffer for cases where a write does not end with a newline,
but that is just a minor detail.) Every full line written
to /proc/mtab would then be parsed (as simple as finding
the spaces and verify that there are exactly five). The
relevant fields in the mountpoint listed in field two will
then be updated.

We agree on that.

That is another possible solution. And as I think a litle
more about it, that is probably a better than the solution I
suggested.
There are a few details of the API that needs to be defined
before it can be implemented. So I hope people will say how
they like it. As I see it there are a few different
possibilities:
1) Make a new mount system call. Finally get rid of the old
   magic value in the flag register and add the extra argument
   which is then required. Make the old mount system call
   obsolete, but keep it for some versions. The old mount
   system call should then just behave as if the user data
   was the empty string.
2) Add a new flag for the old mount system call, which
   indicates that there is one more argument containing the
   user data.

Yes.

I never wanted a /proc/mtab to emulate the existing /etc/mtab.
In fact I wanted it to resemble the existing /proc/mounts as
much as possible, just with a few new features and probably
a different string in the device field in some cases.
