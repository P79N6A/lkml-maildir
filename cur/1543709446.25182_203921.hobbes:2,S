Please, no keyboards.  Some people want to be able to use kgdboe
to find out why machine number 324 down the corridor just died.
How about just doing
char *why_i_crashed;
{
	...
	if (expr1)
		why_i_crashed = "hit a BUG";
	else if (expr2)
		why_i_crashed = "divide by zero";
	else ...
}
then provide a gdb macro which prints out the string at *why_i_crashed?
