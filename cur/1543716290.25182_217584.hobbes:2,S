You're right, but in a laptop using the integrated modem is more 
practical, with less stuff to carry, and less power involved. Provided 
of course I do it at my own risk, and don't try to rebutt the troubles I 
may get into to kernel people, which has more useful things to do, than 
following my personal whims.
BTW on my previous laptop I had a Lucent winmodem, whose driver doesn't 
fake the GPL license, but which was definitely inferior to the Linuxant 
driver, except for the hardware probing stupid implementation.
I'm looking forward for a time when being "Designed for Linux" will be 
more rewarding for a manufacturer than being "Designed for Windows" but 
till then I must get along with what is available.

There's no *run-time* sign. But I was made aware of that when I 
downloaded it from a different source, and I had to agree to a non GPL 
license. It didn't originate from kernel group and I'm using it at my 
own risk.

Maybe I fail to grasp the full picture, but I'd just have ignored it. 
Please remember that they "fake" GPL only at run-time, not when you get 
them.

If you download the "generic package with source" either rpm or tar.gz, 
you'll find the GPL directory populated. I've checked again right now, 
just to be sure. At least, this holds true for hsf modem, which is the 
one I'm actually using.
If you're interested, and have time, you may also estimate if they've 
implemented in the GPL part all of the critical kernel code (as I had 
assumed, maybe naively, from a cursory look to the code), leaving in the 
proprietary binaries only the "proprietary" compression/decompression 
algorithms, or if they've just provided a minimal wrapper, with all 
"real" code proprietary.
It may make sense not to have anything left in the GPL directory in a 
binary only .rpm package, because once linked GPL parts cannot be told 
apart from non-GPL ones.
