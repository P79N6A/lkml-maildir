It shouldn't be used for anything new. It's really a private macro
in the context switch code, nothing that any other code is supposed
to use.

kgdb shouldn't need any patches to core kernel I had it some time ago running fine
just by hooking it into the die hooks (and minor changes to the serial layer,
with netpoll these shouldn't be even needed anymore) 
If the kgdb people need more changes they should submit them.
But I suspect if they change RESTORE_CONTEXT they're doing something wrong
anyways and they just need to fix their code properly.
