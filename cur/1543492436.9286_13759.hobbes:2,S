Hello,
Does anyone know if Linux modules exist for the network card decribed below,
or I am being obtuse and just don't know which driver to use?
I have several of the cards, they are "TRENDnet 10/100Mbps PCI ethernet"
cards.
They have two chips on the PCI card I list them below;
     DAVICOM
     DM9101F
     9839-BT
     M7N65
and
     Winbond
     W89C840F
     813AD280264302
Cheers
Robert
