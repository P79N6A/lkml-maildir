Dear Igmar Palsenberg,
I can not make sure it is hardware problem, but I have interest in this 
case's reproducing.
If you tell me your platform's construction, I will try it and give you good 
solution.
Does your RAID adapter's firmware version work on 1.42?
Areca firmware had fix some hardware bugs and rare sg length handle in this 
version.
Best Regards
Erich Chen
