I guess you mean that driver writers may not want to make each piece of code
referring to this flag depend on CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.  Any driver that actually
writes to it will be buggy ...

Yeah, good catch.  I will.

Yes, I'll do that.

Well, isn't it actually dangerous to suspend parents before their children?
What happens, for example, if putting the parent into D3 causes power to be
cut from the children and then we attempt to suspend them?

Yes, I'll add a stack dump here.
In fact, I'm going to add WARN_ON(true) in both places.

Hah, thanks, will remove.
