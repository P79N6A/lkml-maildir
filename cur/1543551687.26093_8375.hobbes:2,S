I also think it should work, because dd has to read the block before
writing it. By the time dd has the block and starts writing, the kernel
should have no business any more with that read request. The bs=4k is
needed in the case where the underlying filesystem has that blocksize.
The current method then results in a 4k encryption chunk size. Reading
the dd default of 512 bytes and writing them back before the rest of the
4k chunk has been read, would result in garbage read and subsequently
written. I have actually tested this with a 100+ Mbyte filesystem. It is
currently the only way to change the passphrase and/or the cipher used.

I guess it means 0,1,2,3,4..., but you might want to check
http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/draft-rogaway-ipsec-comments-00.txt
I have not gotten around to reading it, but it is cited in one of the
papers that are already on NIST's "Modes of Operation" Workshop page.
(see 
http://www.nist.gov/aes
).

If we use hashes, then we can make the following (taken from Appl.
Crypto.):
Let P[0]..P[N] be the N plaintext blocks, each the size of the cipher
block size, of a 512 byte encryption chunk.
Let H be a message digest (e.g. SHA-1), with the digest trunctated to
the cipher's block size.
Let E the cipher, K the key, C[0]..C[N] the ciphertext.
Calculate h=H(P[2..N]). Encrypt P[0]..P[N] in CBC mode, using h as IV.
To decrypt, first decrypt C[2..N] with C[1] as IV, then calculate
h=H(P[2..N]) and decrypt C[0,1] with h as IV.
