Seems like bad hardware is very common indeed. Anyway, I guess it
would be fair to document what ext3 expects from disk subsystem for
safe operation. Does that summary sound correct/fair?

+Requirements
+============
+
+Ext3 expects disk/storage subsystem to behave sanely. On sanely
+behaving disk subsystem, data that have been successfully synced will
+stay on the disk. Sane means:
+
+* writes to media never fail. Even if disk returns error condition during
+  write, ext3 can't handle that correctly, because success on fsync was already
+  returned when data hit the journal.
+
+	   (Fortunately writes failing are very uncommon on disks, as they
+	   have spare sectors they use when write fails.)
+
+* either whole sector is correctly written or nothing is written during
+  powerfail.
+
+	   (Unfortuantely, all the cheap USB/SD flash cards I seen do behave
+	   like this, and are unsuitable for ext3. Because RAM tends to fail
+	   faster than rest of system during powerfail, special hw killing
+	   DMA transfers may be neccessary. Not sure how common that problem
+	   is on generic PC machines).
+
+* either write caching is disabled, or hw can do barriers and they are enabled.
+
+	   (Note that barriers are disabled by default, use "barrier=1"
+	   mount option after making sure hw can support them).
