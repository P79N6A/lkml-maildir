Oh, I see. You can do it because you don't support fully preemptible
kernels. It makes sense it that scenario. I could not use this scheme
for my markers though, since I support fully preemptible kernels.

Ok, so you already used the IPI serialization I am talking about. Great :)

It looks like a good way to know where the processes are stopped.

Great, continue your good work!
