The chipset is being limited by what the CPU is giving it. If the CPU 
sends only a small amount of data in one access then the chipset usually 
does not try to burst more than that.

Well, in order for the CPU to batch up more writes you'd have to map the 
  BAR as either write-combining or write-back. If it's not listed in 
/proc/mtrr it will be the default setting of uncacheable. X has code to 
set up the video memory on the video card as write-combining so it can 
get better write performance, you could do something similar.
Setting it as write-back might allow you to get the reads to do bursting 
  as well (since the CPU will do a cache-line fill instead of individual 
accesses) but this if the device is modifying this memory area, unless 
you add code to invalidate those cache lines before reading the data 
you'll get stale data back. You could run into some other less obvious 
issues as well, as normally device memory regions are not mapped write-back.
In general, especially if you need to read data back from the device, 
implementing a DMA engine would be by far the better option. Most 
chipsets seem not at all optimized for handling sequential reads from 
PCI memory from the CPU. (Even in the DMA case, you have to be careful 
with what type of memory read transaction you use when transferring from 
host memory - some chipsets don't like to burst more than one cycle if 
you use normal Memory Read instead of Memory Read Line or Memory Read 
Multiple.)
