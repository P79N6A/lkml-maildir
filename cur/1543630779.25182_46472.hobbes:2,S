For example, lets think of that i am compiling an update kernel not on the local machine but on any other pc using telnet or ssh emulators. And eventually it is time to reboot the machine and and run on the new kernel. However there has been an error during the compiling. - such as misconfiguration. Normally the machine will not boot and halt. So, is not there any way to reboot itself from the previous kernel after some time that it realizes it cannot boot properly. Maybe there is such a way. But, if not, this is an imaginary. Because i usually see these kind of problems ;)
usually you'll use a hardware watchdog for that purpose. - but you need
to be sure to instruct your bootloader to boot the old image when the watchdog
reboots your machine ...
