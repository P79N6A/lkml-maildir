Avoid the reschedule_idle() call - it's quite costly, and it could cause
processes jumping from one cpu to another.

If one process runs, wakes up another process and _knows_ that it's
going to sleep immediately after the wake_up it doesn't need the
reschedule_idle: the current cpu will be idle soon, the scheduler
doesn't need to find another cpu for the woken up thread.
I think the pipe code is the only user of _sync right now - pipes cause
an incredible amount of task switches.
