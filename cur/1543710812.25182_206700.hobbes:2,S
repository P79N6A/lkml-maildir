Oh.  So what was the question again?
As far as I know, there's nobody in DRI-land who actually prepares and
sends patches.  Fixing that would be a good first step ;)
I've had a 130k DRM patch in -mm since February 8th.  Presumably it's out
of date.  As far as I know nobody is pushing more recent patches upstream.
What's the process here, and who should I be dealing with?
Thanks.
