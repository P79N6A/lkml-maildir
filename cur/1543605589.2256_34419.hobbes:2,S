Yes-yes! XFree does not put more extra overhead than Windows ... And even
the first drivers for XFree 4 almost gave the same result as Windows
Turbo GL drivers ... Probably architecture of XFree/DRI/GLX/etc is MUCH
better than Windows! The problem is "ONLY" that there're less GOOD driver
written for Linux/XFree than Windows ... I don't see any major problem
with XFree ... only write GOOD drivers and make vendors release drivers
which are as good as Windows drivers (or better ...)
If someone wants to move more things into kernel space it will cause
LESS driver for Linux since many vendor does not like release open
source drivers (as I said it's because of our non-perfect world :),
and it's much harder to produce binary-only drivers as kernel modules
than let's say XFree drivers. But this is only ONE point. The techniqual
one is also forces me to say that keep as much things in user space as
possible (of course without major hurting in performance ...).
