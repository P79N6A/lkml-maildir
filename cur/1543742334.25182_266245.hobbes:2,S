 Please have a look at the relevant local APIC specification.  For the
P6-class local APIC a write of zero (or likely any value -- I don't
remember) to the ESR makes the internal error status be copied to the
externally visible ESR.  A read of the ESR returns its contents and clears
it.  Thus the report is perfectly valid -- it means no uncleared error was
left over before.
 For the record: for the P5-class local APIC the ESR is the only error
status and it is also cleared on a read.  Thus for that implementation the
error codes reported would be reversed.  Writes to the ESR have no effect
by definition.  Unfortunately, a range of chips have suffered from an
erratum which makes data on writes to the ESR being actually recorded in
the register.  As a result, we cannot just do a sequence consisting of a
write and a read -- we need to do that leading read to handle buggy chips
correctly.  And we do need to write zero specifically as otherwise a bogus
error would be reported for them.
 I don't remember what the specification for the P4-class local APIC is in
this area, or what other vendors' implementations do.  The i82489DX APIC
does not implement error reporting.
 Frankly, I think this P5-to-P6 APIC specification change is an
unnecessary annoyance for an OS developer.  And there are more caveats
like this across local APIC implementations, this perhaps being the least
harmful one.
