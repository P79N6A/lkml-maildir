Subject: [PATCH 000 of 13] knfsd: Preparation for IPv6 support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following are 13 patches for nfsd/sunrpc that are suitabble for
2.6.20.  They are from Chuck Lever and generalise some dependancies on
IPv4 to prepare the way for IPv6.  There is still a lot of work to do
before we can actually use IPv6 to talk to NFSD, but this removes some
barriers.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
