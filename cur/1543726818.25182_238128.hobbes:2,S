I'll take your point on the technical merits.
But now I get to wondering what to do about all the old HOWTOs. the 
cdrecord folks aren't helping.
	Maybe instead what should be done is a BIG FAT WARNING in the syslog? 
that the CDROM_SEND_PACKET interface is deprecated in kernel 2.6? I 
know that I personally can listen and take your advice, but I worry 
more about the rest of the users, who either will not hear, or will 
hear too many conflicting things. Perhaps it won't help, but I'd really 
like to be able to sell this stuff. And among the necessary things is 
to be able to have sane warnings, and not have warnings that will scare 
my customers off!
	Yes, this isn't really your (you==Jens) problem, but probably the 
distro maintainers (cc:d ArkLinux) to put in patches silencing some of 
these warnings, and/or change the default behaviour of their front-end 
tools.
	I merely hope to find some sanity. Though I have a feeling I'm looking 
in the wrong places (Free and Open Source).
