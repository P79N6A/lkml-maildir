hm, maybe.  We should probably also provide a per-file ext3-specific ioctl
to allow specialised apps to manipulate the reservation size.
And we should grow the reservation size dynamically.  I've suggested that
we double its size each time it is exhausted, up to some limit.  There may
be better algorithms though.
This work doesn't help us with the slowly-growing logfile or mailbox file
problem.  I guess that would require on-disk reservations, or a new
`chattr' hint or such.
