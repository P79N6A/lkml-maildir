If you want to make cleaner and faster code, why not work on LZO
upstream directly? I'm sure the LZO author would welcome the speedups,
just as much as the kernel would. 
If they're accepted into LZO, I'm nearly certain the kernel will accept
them and if the kernel code is as I've proposed, upgrading is
straightforward too. Working with "upstream" is often harder but
ultimately much more rewarding.

And there are concerns against your patches including:
* endian issues
* alignment issues
* potential security holes
* unexplained code generation differences
* difficulty of upgrading
Compared to the style/bloat issue, I'd say that's a fair compromise.
