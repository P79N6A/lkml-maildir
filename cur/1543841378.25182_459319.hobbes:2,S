Hi,
I wish to build ramdisk image for Intel IXP4xx architecture/processor for 
linux kernel rls 2.6.16 with Debian Sarge 3.1. Can some body help me in giving 
instructions to create ramdisk image successfully?
I attempted to build ramdisk as said in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/linux-
2.6.16/Documentation/ramdisk.txt but failed to get the compact size. 
Thanks in advance,
Bhanu Prakash A
