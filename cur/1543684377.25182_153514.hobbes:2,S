Cool idea!  Maybe for each module, it could have a subdirectory to it 
(like reiser4's files-as-directory (see 
http://www.namesys.com/v4/pseudo.html
)) and in that subdirectory are 
files to configure the options.  You take your module, module.ko, and 
you want to set some options (before or after loading it).  Maybe you 
could do something like
echo "true" > module.ko/option for your module.  Then you just
cp module.ko /proc/modules or whatever directory to insert?
