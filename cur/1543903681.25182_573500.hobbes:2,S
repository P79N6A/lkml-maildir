The first System, where harddisc don't work at all with the new stack: 
Nvidia NForce2 Ultra Chipset; 1GB RAM; XP-M 2600; FW-Controller is
PCI addon card; lspci says Via
Vanilla Kernel 2.6.22, apic, Preempt, Dynamic Tics. hmm something else 
interesting?

Second System, here replugging helped, testet with harddisc and external
dvd-rw drive:
Nvidia Nforce2 (no Ultra!) Chipset; 1GB Ram XP-M 2500@2600; Same FW Controller
