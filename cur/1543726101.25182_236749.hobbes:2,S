hardirqs (unlike softirqs) we might attempt to make preemptable. It
really should work because if they run with interrupts enabled then they
must be prepared to see interrupts coming from a similar device using
the same softirq facilities.
migration between CPUs we can prevent easily. While it's not common for
a driver to rely on per-CPU-ness _outside_ of a spinlocked region, it
could in theory happen.
for now i've gone the more conservative route of keeping irqs atomic
still, and applying lock-break methods to them.

this is not enough: DMA-IDE creates big latencies too, and those
latencies happen under a spinlock - so with your patch it would be
non-preemptible still.

yeah, i fixed it via cond_resched_softirq(), _after_ making sure it's
safe to preempt there - softirqs are not generally preemption safe
because they are fundamentally per-CPU. (meanwhile Dmitry Torokhov has
posted a patch that fixes the atkbd.c problem for real by using
workqueues. The psmouse-base.c problem needs a similar fix.)

agreed. I punted this one for the time being as it's clearly separate
from the issue of latencies and it's deeply intrusive to 2.6.

e.g. in the IO-APIC case if we ack the local APIC only in the end()
function then we must do that - an un-acked local APIC prevents other
IRQs from being delivered. We do this for level-triggered IO-APIC irqs.

this is an incorrect change, just grep for in_interrupt() in
linux/drivers/ ...
I agree with the concept of using multiple threads for interrupts - i'll
add that to the voluntary-preempt patch too. This is an essential
feature to prioritize interrupts.
what do you think about making the i8259A's interrupt priorities
configurable? (a'la rtirq patch) Does it make any sense, given how early
we mask the source irq and ack the interrupt controller [hence giving
all other interrupts a fair chance to arrive ASAP]?
Bernhard Kuhn's rtirq patch is for IO-APIC/APICs, but i think the
latency issues could be equally well fixed by not keeping the local APIC
un-ACK-ed during level triggered irqs, but doing the mask & ack thing.
This will be slightly slower but should make them both redirectable and
more symmetric and fair.
