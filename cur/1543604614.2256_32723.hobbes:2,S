registered ecc dimms from crucial and kingston valueram are barely more
than non-registered parts... I see the 512MB kingston registered ecc ddram
part for $220 from a large mailorder house. the same spec part from
corsair is still $489 from the same vendor. given the headaches that
result from having to debug problems/faulty dimms on a machine with 2GB of
ram and the non-trivial engineering that went into getting 4 reasonably
spaced ddr dimm sockets on the mainboard. I expect registered ecc dimms
will be well worth it, if only so that you can rule out the memory as the
culprit if you have certain kinds of issues...
