The same can be said about signal queues.

I don't see this as a big enough issue to outweigh the benefits.  It is fairly
easy to pick out a signal and use it.  (It it more difficult to ensure that
other things don't stomp on your signal handlers).
The benefits that I see of POSIX stuff is that there is already a precedent
and API out there.  It allows you to queue I/O requests and let the OS worry
about shoving the data out the pipe.
Somethings that I think would be very nice additions is the ability to
grab multiple events from the queue, aio_{read,write}v(), and aio_sendfile().
I think that an efficient Asynchronous I/O daemon (or handling algorithms)
could beat out the userland data pushing.
