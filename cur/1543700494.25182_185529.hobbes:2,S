Thanks for clarification and the pointers. Nice to know, that this 
issue is still under investigation.
Let me add, that your and your companies strong continuous linux 
commitment/support has influenced and will influence our future 
hardware decisions. 
And NICs are a crucial part of our diskless setups..

Thanks again and merry christmas,

If only some manufacturer would pick up the _existing_ pieces, and 
create a barebone like fanless Pentium M based system with a CSA 
attached 8254x NIC. Add SSD for swap/suspend, or get nbd to work for 
those, and be done with a low current consumption/low heat/zero dB 
system, which easily outperforms current local harddisk setups.
BTW: I do remember 0 dB computing back in the 80ies on my 8MHz, 4 MB
Atari ST. Oh, well..
