Please don't just yet. I've already got this patch to do it, but
I've got more kswapd work underneath that (which makes kswapd
work properly with higher order allocations).
Currently it does not overschedule, because one zone is always
going to be low by the time kswapd wakes up. This causes all zones
below to be scanned as well.
