You implement a bunch of different functions here. I agree with Jeff's
feedback related to the lack of scalability the way the API is going
right now.
Another example of this is that the driver is doing it's own self-test
of the functions. This means that every backend driver will need to
duplicate this code. Wouldn't it be easier for everyone if the common
infrastructure did a test call at the time of registration of a
function instead, and return failure if it doesn't pass?

ioatdma.h is currently under drivers/dma/. If the contents is strictly
device-related please add them under drivers/dma.
