Subject: Problem with psmouse detecting generic ImExPS/2

I noticed this after upgrading 2.6.6->2.6.7
Even after building psmouse as a module, and specifying the protocol,
all I get is an ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse.
[root@purgatory root]# modprobe psmouse proto=exps
Jun 21 01:51:57 purgatory kernel: input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on
isa0060/serio1
My ImExPS/2 was detected correctly in <=2.6.6 and after examining the
current psmouse code, and the changes in patch-2.6.7, I can't figure out
what's breaking it.  A little help?
