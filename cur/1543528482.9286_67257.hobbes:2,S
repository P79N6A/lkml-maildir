    I suspect that mapping roms and acpi memory into the regular memory
    segment might not be the most optimal way of doing things.   The PCI
    code, once upon a time (and still?) set up their own memory segment
    to get at pci stuff that was in awkward places;  this might be a
    good solution to mismatches between Linux's memory model and the way
    vendors might scatter things around in memory.

    Quite possibly.  I'm pretty some of the older award bioses still did
    e801, but since I wrote the fancy memory detection code e801 and 88
    could both set the motherboard on fire and I'd never know until the
    fire department arrives.

    david parsons \bi/ I'm not expecting any of the new Award bioses are likely
                   \/  to ever spontaneously backport to any of my 366s, either.
