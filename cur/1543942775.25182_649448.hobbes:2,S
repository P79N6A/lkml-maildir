/dev/cpu/msr is bogus.  It should be /dev/cpu/0/msr etc.
Sounds like your version of udev might be out of date, or you're using 
an old kernel which doesn't communicate /dev/cpu/* to udev properly.
Revert your hacks and, if you have to create the nodes manually, use the 
MAKEDEV script included with the msr-tools.
