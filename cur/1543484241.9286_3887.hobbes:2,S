I hope you mean "new ioctl should have been added and old _documented_
as deprecated"; removing (or changing) old interfaces as soon as a new
one comes along is simply unacceptable.  When I upgrade my kernel from
2.0.30 to 2.0.35, I expect _everything_ to continue working as it did
before.  If a major change must be made, bump the major number; I have
no problem with having to get a new version of inet-utils when I change
from 2.0.36 to 2.2.1...
