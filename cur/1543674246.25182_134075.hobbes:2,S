   I get this, too, on two recently-purchased machines. I suspect that
the new revs of the chips are the cause -- my kernel doesn't seem to
know about many of the device IDs on this board:
hrm@cader:~$ lspci
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 2560 (rev 03)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 2562 (rev 03)
00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24c2 (rev 02)
00:1d.1 USB Controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24c4 (rev 02)
00:1d.2 USB Controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24c7 (rev 02)
00:1d.7 USB Controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24cd (rev 02)
00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 82820 820 (Camino 2) Chipset PCI (rev 82)
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24c0 (rev 02)
00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24cb (rev 02)
00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24c3 (rev 02)
00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24c5 (rev 02)
01:08.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 1039 (rev 82)
   Other than the odd csum failures (average of 1-2 a day on each
box), it all seems to work perfectly.
   Hugo.
