if apache 1.3 is compiled with -DSINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT it'll
avoid the fcntl() serialisation when there is only one listening port.  
(it still uses it for multiple listeners... you can read all about my
logic for that at <
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/perf-tuning.html>.
)
is it appropriate for this to be defined for newer linux kernels?  i
haven't kept track, sorry.  tell me what versions to conditionalize it on.
