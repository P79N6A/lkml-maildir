    Your writer doesn't seem to work good with cdrecord...

    First, CD recording doesn't have to do directly with the kernel.
AFAIK, the kernel driver just passes commands to the device, is the
userspace app which generates the commands.
    Second, your writer looks faulty, although the problem may be a
simple incompatibility between the device and cdrecord.
    Third, not, you cannot get eye damage due to a faulty kernel
driver, but is possible to get eye damage if you look directly to a
laser. No matter if you use Linux or not.

    I don't think so. Better: I *hope* that my CD writer mechanics
can stand high temperatures without destroying, otherwise it won't
last long...

    Do you think that the kernel designers want to create a good
source of coasters? My writer (Plextor) has burned almost 500 CD's
more or less, and I only have two coasters. Certainly both cdrecord
and the kernel seems to work quite good here. But my old CD writer, a
Philips 3610 (or something like that) did more or less what you tell
when it got broken.
