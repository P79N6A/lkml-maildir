Ok, so the "trust chain" you're talking about is simply the decision of the
admin to compile-in the (verified and trusted) public keys of known trusted
entities into the kernel at build time. That is not really scalable, but I guess
you might just as well impose such a restriction for sake of simplicity.
[ I initially thought a scenario where a given binary is signed by an
entity whose
corresponding public key is _not_ present in the kernel, but who does possess
a signature -- over its name, id and public key -- by another entity whose
corresponding public key _is_ built into the kernel). Then at the time of
verification there's really no other alternative to *build* the entire
chain at the
_point of verification_ (in-kernel) itself ... but this obviously
introduces huge and
ugly complexities that you'd have a hard time bringing into the kernel :-) That
"signature over name, id and public key" could be a _certificate_ (if you care
about following standards), and building their chains in-kernel ... well. But if
you really want to differentiate between kernel and userspace from security
perspective, and want to give such functionality, I don't see any easy
way out. ]

Kernel-userspace differentiation from security perspective is always tricky
(so this is why I pointed you to the discussions whenever such stuff, such
as asymmetric crypto and modsign etc are proposed to be merged). It's
definitely not impossible to compromise a _running_ kernel from privileged
userspace, if it really wanted to do so ...
