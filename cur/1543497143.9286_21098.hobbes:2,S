Hmmm, I must not understand something here.
Let there be an algorithm A that calls routine B
in the inner loop. Then the time to finish A
over the same data is directly proportional to
the time it takes to do B, whatever the
order of A may be.
Put another way, if you double the speed of the
processor (memory etc keeping up), then the
algorithm finishes in half the time.
The same goes if you find a way to cut the
time for B in half.
