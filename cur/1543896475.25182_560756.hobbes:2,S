Hi again,
Of course it is not there because I removed it myself :/ The "sensors" command 
will just produce "general parse error" this is because of the unknown device 
class (imho). So I removed that and forgot. Well now I have the sysfs files:
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/device/:
bus         fan0_min    fan2_input  fan3_label    in0_input  in1_label  in2_max 
    in3_min    temp0_crit   temp1_input
driver      fan1_input  fan2_label  fan3_max      in0_label  in1_max    in2_min 
    name       temp0_input  temp1_label
fan0_input  fan1_label  fan2_max    fan3_min      in0_max    in1_min 
in3_input  path       temp0_label  temp1_max
fan0_label  fan1_max    fan2_min    hid           in0_min    in2_input 
in3_label  power      temp0_max    uevent
fan0_max    fan1_min    fan3_input  hwmon:hwmon2  in1_input  in2_label  in3_max 
    subsystem  temp1_crit
Please note that in kernelsrc/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface
is defined the interface. We have fans starting from 1 and not 0
Also temperatures are in milidegrees. So your 3200 should be 32000.
Temps file starts also from 1 and not 0. (so no temp0...)
Please can you fix this issues? I will do the review later once this things are 
fixed. Values seems to match.
Thanks,
Rudolf
