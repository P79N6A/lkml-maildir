I agree, except for providing access from the very beginning.  If
access can be provided which would never leave the blind user without
speech with a user space solution this would be ideal.

Can you give me more details?  I certainly don't mind looking into
this as a possible solution.  Are you willing to give up seeing
anything on the screen until init gets started?

It bothers me as well.  I am currently working toward trying to make
them into standard drivers which can be loaded as modules.  We have
new synths coming along which are pci, usb and pcmcia that would be
easier to integrate if I used a standard driver interface.
I am getting a lot of pressure to make some sort of software synth
solution available for folks that cannot afford a hardware synth or
use a platform which doesn't support hardware synths.  I also have an
over all philosophy which requires me to provide solutions that
include speech and review capabilities from power up to power down.
Open BIOS and Linux for the first time ever can provide a way for the
blind community to not be a second class citizen to information
access.  I am afraid that if I just take the emacspeak approach to
accessibility then my community will stay beholding to others for
their access to available information.  I am sorry about the soap-box
preaching but it is a fundamental problem with just user space
solutions.
