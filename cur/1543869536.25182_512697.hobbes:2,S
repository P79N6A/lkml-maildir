The only thing I see needed due to PREEMPT_RCU is the following comment
change.
For a terrified few minutes, I thought that the code assumed that struct
rcu_head was the same size as struct list_head, but it turns out to only
assume that struct slab is at least as large as struct slab_rcu.
						Thanx, Paul
