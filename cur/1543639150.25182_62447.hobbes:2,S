Not really.  What we really want is for signals not to be delivered at all.
That's why the ptrace signal annulling capability is nice.
I'm not sure if this makes any sense, but coupling the new aio mechanism with
something that queues up siginfos might be interesting.  It would be a magic
descriptor that would feed you signals when you read it.
Is that at all sane?
