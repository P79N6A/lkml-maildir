Could this be a hardware problem then? The CD-ROM is recognized by
BIOS and I'm able to boot bootable CDs fine.
Could it be a setting in BIOS? I did try to switch from Enhanced to
Compatible mode, but problem persists.
With the ide driver, the device is recognized, but when I attempt to
mount it, il times out, gets reset and my machine locks up at times.

With the pata_jmicron, the device is not recognized. I get the
timeouts only during the probing during the boot phase.
