That's just not true anymore, at least not for NDS.  Novell's latest
version (called "eDirectory" these days) runs very gracefully on Linux
(and solaris, too, FWIW).  It's possible to run an entire NDS
infrastructure with running netware these days.  This has been out for
quite awhile.
Go to this page and scroll down to "eDirectory", and you can download
and play with it yourself:
http://download.novell.com/sdMain.jsp
Note that the package also includes PAM login modules for linux.  Also
note full LDAP compatibility.
As a side note, novell has an intriguing metadirectory technology called
DirXML, which can glue any directory to any other directory with XML
templates.  You can use it to synchronize an Oracle table with an NDS
userlist, for example.

Hrm, please qualify that.  Why do you think it's obsolete?  It's
considerably more advanced (and certainly more secure) than most of the
other options out there, including LDAP-over-SSL.  Just a bitch to
admin.

PAM is the standardized and agreed-upon method for divorcing
authentication from the system.  It's been like that for quite some time
now.  What if this discussion was about some Linux GUI apps not being
compatible with X?  The boat's been sailing for quite some time, either
hop on or build your own, I say, or swim (sink?).

What's wrong with the name service switch stuff?  and more importantly,
PAM?
The "PAM isn't supported by enough apps" argument is kind of weak. 
Reason being that the developer chose not to support it.  I for one
don't think the kernel should be modified just because Joe Blow
hardcoded open (/etc/passwd), or whatever.

I personally believe that nothing will be so pivotal in a desktop war as
a good, unified directory.  Is the desktop a growth area for Linux?  You
betcha.  There are other areas (i.e. embedded) that Linux could benefit
from directories, too (think of a cellphone that anyone could use by
"logging into" it).

Who, besides root, would ever need to perform activities before userland
processes can start?

Handled all by PAM and name service switch.

Agreed, by hand it would be painful.  But why are scripts so scary? 
Just don't screw up :) .
I have played on a team which maintained 1000+ solaris and sunos
workstations, each with their own /etc, for a userlist > 7000 users. 
Everything (passwd, shadow, group, printcap, etc) lived in NIS. 
Individual changes to system files were made with rdist or cronjobs.  I
believe Linux+LDAP (or even NDS, because of the awesome performance)
would be much better suited to this task.
As long as you do enough testing, it's probably the ultimate way to
maintain lots of machines.  Again, note that this was done with an
obsolete (in my opinion, this time :) directory services (NIS).
