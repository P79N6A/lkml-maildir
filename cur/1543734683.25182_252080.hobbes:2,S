Subject: [patch] sched, vfs: fix scheduling latencies in prune_dcache() and select_parent()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/14/93

the attached patch fixes long scheduling latencies in select_parent()
and prune_dcache(). The prune_dcache() lock-break is easy, but for
select_parent() the only viable solution i found was to break out if
there's a resched necessary - the reordering is not necessary and the
dcache scanning/shrinking will later on do it anyway.
This patch has been in the -VP patchset for weeks.
