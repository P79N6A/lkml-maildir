The kernel works around/ignores/disables other broken hardware or broken
features of otherwise working hardware with black lists.  There will be
many *many* of these laptops sold.
Is there a way to uniquely identify the affected BIOSes at boot time and
turn off APM?  According to Brad Douglas, the 32-bit Get Power Status
(0AH) call is broken.
Supposedly there will be a BIOS update in the "future" to correct this
problem.
