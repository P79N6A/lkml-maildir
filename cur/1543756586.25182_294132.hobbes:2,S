Lets summarize your main arguments from two threads - 
"irq_controller_lock" and this one:
(sorry, I summarized since I somehow accidently lost traack of 
"irq_controller_lock" thread and want to be sure I haven't missed anything)
1) if we drop ide_controller_lock we need to add per-chip lock due to 
read-modify-write issue
true
2) per-descriptor lock will not bring gains since
    a) SMP - almost nonexistent at the moment
As Daniel said - why not look to the future - did anybody expect 3 month 
  ago RT enchancement for Linux?! progress is too quick - and again from 
the perspective of SMP - irq_controller_lock is defective.
    b) lots of contention on request_irq/free_irq - rare
seems true
    c) multiple devices on the same interrupt line - rare
seems true
But in a whole it's not so unambiguously what outweighs - b)&c) against 
contra a)
3) per chip lock in combination with per descriptor lock
   a) decreases peformance
why not to lock per-chip lock only for chips indeed require this (i.e. 
with read/modify/write/) and drop the locking otherwise?!
   b) (quoatition):
      "Yes, and then audit that no one uses different irqchip structures
       covering the same register (consider a read-modify-write mask
       register where some IRQs are edge and others are level riggered.)"
such a register and a chip have ono-to-one relationship, do they? chip 
lock is something connected to _the_ chip. The above situation is 
definitly up to a developer and his own _fault_.
4) ARM IRQs are already "threaded"
As you said:  can we _please_ get the terminology right? As Nicolas 
pointed you were talking about completely different "threaded".
