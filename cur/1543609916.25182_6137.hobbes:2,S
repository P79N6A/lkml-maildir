I went ahead and did this. Booted up and got the expected error message 
when HID tried to load. Keyboard works but USB mouse ofcourse does not. 
So I went and renamed hid.hidden to hid.o and loaded it. Now my USB 
keyboard and USB mouse are working.
I suspect it has something to do with the order the modules are loaded? 
hid.o must be last? I am just guessing.
I suppose I can edit the rc.sysinit to load hid AFTER usbkbd is loaded.
