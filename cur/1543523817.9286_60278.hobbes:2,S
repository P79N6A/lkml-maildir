Subject: (2.2.38) CDROM eject problems?

For some reason, 2.3.38 is refusing to allow me to eject my cdrom, 
regardless of whether it's mounted. Here's the results of 'eject hdc':
foobar:/home/nullset# eject -f hdc
eject: CDROMEJECT ioctl failed for `/dev/hdc': Device or resource busy
foobar:/home/nullset# eject -f hdc
eject: CDROMEJECT ioctl failed for `/dev/hdc': Device or resource busy
and it keeps going :)
The only way i've found to get my CDs out is to force them out w/ my key
(which i don't like doing, it's bad for both CD and drive) and rebooting.
This worked fine under 2.2.x.  Any suggestions?
Thanks
