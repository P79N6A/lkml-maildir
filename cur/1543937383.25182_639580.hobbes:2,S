I tested 2.6.24-rc8-rt1 on our phytec phyCORE-MPC5200B-tiny. I runned cyclictest
with exactly the same parameter as you used and made some non-rt Workload with
"hackbench 5" in a while 1 loop and a "ping -f" from a host machine. I run the
test for about 3 hours and could not push the latency to higher than 220 us.
(The latency tracer is also turned on in kernel). Could you please send me your
kernelconfig privately?
cheers
