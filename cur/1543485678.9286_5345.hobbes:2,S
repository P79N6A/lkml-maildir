Nope, by the time the commands make it to the low level driver, the
device target/lun entries have already been filled out by the upper
level SCSI code.

The allocation of sg devices on your system has changed for whatever
reason.  You just need to find the right sg device for your CD-R to make
things work.  The general rule is, if the sg driver doesn't openly claim
any devices, then walk the device list in /proc/scsi/scsi and assign
each device and entry in the form of sga to sg? in the order they are
listed in that file.  When you hit your CD-R, you will have your
device.  However, if the SG driver *does* claim some of the devices at
startup (aka, is says /dev/sga on scsi host x... during the startup
messages), then you have to start your counting with the first sg?
device after the last sg device name that was printed out.  IOW, if the
SCSI code claimed you had two sd devices, one st device, and one sg
device, then /dev/sga would belong to the device that was claimed as sga
at bootup, sgb would belong to the first device listed in
/proc/scsi/scsi that isn't already claimed by the sg driver, sgc would
be the second device, etc, you get the point.  Track down that device
name change and it will be settled.
