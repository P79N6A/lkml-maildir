Last time I had a look at this the blockage seemed to be due to named
switching the socket from nonblocking to blocking behaviour immediately
before the close(). 
They seem to do the following:
when accepting a connection:
- accept fd
- save the state of the O_NONBLOCK flag
- set O_NONBLOCK
- FD_SET() the fd for select()
before closing:
- FD_CLR()
- restore the state of O_NONBLOCK flag
- close()
named then blocks until the close() proceeds. I did already send a mail
to them couple of months ago, but never got a reply. So I admit I might
have been looking into the wrong direction..
