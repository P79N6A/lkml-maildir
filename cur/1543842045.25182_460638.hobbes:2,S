The following should be the updated patch series for the Intel 965 Express
support, unless I'm making some mistake with git-send-email.  I think I've
covered Dave's concerns, except for making the PCI ID stuff table-driven.  You
can find a patch for that on the intel-agp-i965 branch at
git://anongit.freedesktop.org/~anholt/linux-2.6
