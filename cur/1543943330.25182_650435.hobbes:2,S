Fixed.

converted to mutexes.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed to be resource_size_t.

Yeow.  Fixed so the sense of the memcpy correct.

Yes, it can!  fixed.
Given the length of time that these errors have been there, I'm really
wondering if the added complexity of this buffer is worth it.

Added another mutex around access to probed_devices

Fixed.  There is one warning (related to a function that is not called),
but I'd like to leave this in, as it should get bound to an ioctl, most
likely.
Thanks alot for the comments!
