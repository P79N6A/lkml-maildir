Yes, most devices drivers that rely on ISA or PCI attachment now
appear to be gone.
However, I just tried and found that out of the 23 driver submenus, only
"Generic Driver Options", "Block devices", "SCSI device support",
"Multi-device support", "Networking support" and "Character devices"
make any sense at all. All others depend on some hardware that has
never been attached to an s390 box. 
We could of course build some subsystems like MTD, ISDN or FB, but
there is still little point without any low-level drivers.
