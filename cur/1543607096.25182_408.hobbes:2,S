NO! US citizens should provide the most pressure, but thinking that
nations which the USA trades with and is partners with have no influence
is plain wrong. To state only citizens of USA can help means that you
truly believe the USA is an island untouched by the world around it. You
can't fight this from jail, but you don't have to be a USA citizen to
bring to light the shear stupidity of some US law. Sometimes a foreign
country has more influence in shouting about the wrong doings than do US
citizens...the political point of information input is different, all
angles are required. You don't have to be responsible for a problem in
order to be able to help solve it.
