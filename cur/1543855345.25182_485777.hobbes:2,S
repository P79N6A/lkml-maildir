It's non-trivial, I think you are better off going initially with just
using the current framebuffer that X is using, I know ajax was doing
some hacking on this with a "user"-framebuffer, until I disuaded him
due to I think the trouble caused by dual-head and something else I
can't remember..
I personally think we need to probably just bite the bullet and start
sticking graphics drivers into the kernel, the new randr-1.2 interface
for X is probably a good starting point for a generic mode setting
interface that isn't so X dependent and could replace fbdev with
something more sane wrt dualhead and multiple outputs... fbdev could
be implemented on top of that layer then.. also suspend/resume really
needs this sort of thing....
My main worry with integrating graphics drivers into the kernel is
that when they don't work the user gets no screen, with network/sound
etc this isn't so bad, but if they can't see a screen debugging gets
to be a bit more difficult....
Dave.
