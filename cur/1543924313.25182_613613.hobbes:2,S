Heh.  Well, this won't be the first time that we go around the design
circle wiht people objecting with the idea eventually figuring out
that the original idea really was the only sane way to do things.  :-)
Maybe it would be instructive to create a matrix which lists areas
where processes that share namespace FOO but not namespace BAR would
result in breakage, with an explanation of what breaks in a particular
instance?  Assuming we continue to go down the path of orthogonal
namespace, having a file in Documentation/ which lists places where
there different namepsaces have dependencies on each other for correct
system call operation would be a Good Thing.
