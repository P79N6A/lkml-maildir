Jon, please send such reports to the unionfs mailing list directly (see
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
), esp. when it's for unionfs 2.x running on
older kernels such as 2.6.18.  There's no need to bother lkml with such a
report.
I'll email you privately more info on what you need to do to report this
properly.
Thanks,
Erez.
