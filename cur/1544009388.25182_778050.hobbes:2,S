Hi, all,
I have tested and verified that these two patches can let my LSI-SAS-1068E
controllers work well with 2.6.26.2 kernels, perfect,
Tested-by: Cheng Renquan <crquan@gmail.com>
but the latest git kernel has not yet been tested. just buildable. I
personally suggest these patches integrated into Greg KH's staging
tree. It seems meet staging's purpose well?
The bugzilla page has been updated,
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12163
And the first patch, it's just integrating the vendor driver "4.00.43.00":
Subject:    [PATCH 1/2] mpt fusion: updated mpt drivers from lsi
upstream "4.00.43.00"
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=122848357611653&w=2
To LSI staff:
  Please test it as soon, you have the resources. Please maintain your
driver update in latest git kernel besides and not only major
distrition kernels,
  We customers need to run your mpt controllers not only on major
distribution kernels but also the latest git kernel, you should at
least maintain an updated driver for some major later kernels, like
one for 2.6.24, one for 2.6.27, and one for the latest git tree. At
least the driver in the git tree should be always updated, this would
always keep your driver current.
  I'm your customer located in Shenzhen, China. Please know it and
keep co-operative with your customers and the Linux Kernel Development
Community. Thank you.
