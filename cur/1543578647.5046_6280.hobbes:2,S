How?
You send an EOI by writing 0 to the EOI register of the local apic, and
then the local apic automagically checks it's ISR bitfield.
It takes the highest set bit and clears it. Then it checks that bit in
the TMR, and it if's also set in the TMR then it sends an EOI to the IO
apic.
The magic seems to be tamper proof: all bits are read only.
The bit on the IO apic is also read only.
Perhaps with brute force? Switch the interrupt to edge triggered on the
io apic, wait 1 usec, switch it back to level triggered. The IRR bit is
undefined for edge triggered interrupts, perhaps that clears the IRR
bit.
I would first concentrate on the differences between 2.2 and 2.4:
Frank, could you try what happens with the NMI oopser disabled?
The second major difference I'm immediately aware of is the number of
the reschedule/tlb flush/etc interrupt: 2.2 uses the lowest priority,
2.4 the highest priority.
