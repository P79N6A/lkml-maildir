Not quite. mmc_remove_host() doesn't care if a detect has been executed or not,
it only cares about whether or not one is executing right now. So in order for
your patch to work, there must be no way that mmc_finish_detect() is called
before the detect is scheduled.

Indeed. But it is not by design that they are scheduled before late_initcall().
Also, flushing the workqueue is also not a by-design way of completing a scan,
it just happens to be that way right now.

Then you've learned something new. ;)
Only some devices work that way (generally only those with "simple" interfaces).
And most things are these days behind more advanced buses, more akin to a network.
Generally, not waiting for a lot of hardware is a good thing as it speeds up
boot times. In my mind, the proper way is having a script in an initrd that
waits for just the parts of the hardware that this particular system needs.
Everything else can be brought up in the background.
