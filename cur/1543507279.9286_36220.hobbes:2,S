I strongly second this idea.

SMP is the major reason for module incompatibility.
There is CONFIG_MODVERSIONS which should prevent any module incompatibilities.
However, I don't use it, because it caused seom headache some time ago
(Modules not loading any more after reconfiguring and recompiling the
kernel.) I believe only few people use it.
