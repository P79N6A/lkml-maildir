Well, tmpfs is persistens as long as the machine is powered on (and
you did not manage to fubar the tmpfs etc.), no?
Or, you can also get it out of tmpfs again and restart statd once
you've pivoted.

Since we're on the topic locking, is it because I am not running
statd on the client that my NFS client hangs during boot phase?
