  Hi, Al. I've noticed that you've made changes to the locking rules
for the VFS (for example, the inode lookup() method no longer has the
BKL).
I also note that you've thrown calls to lock_kernel() and
unlock_kernel() into the devfs code. Did you check each place you
added the BKL to devfs that it was needed, or was this just a blind
global operation? At first glance, it appears that many of the places
where the BKL was inserted are not needed.
