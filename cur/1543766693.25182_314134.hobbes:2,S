The patch was written for case a. Indeed lock_kernel() may appear 
incomplete on the open side, but it protects paths where we don't sleep. 
So, the 'fast_track' path in 'init_dev', is protected against the 
release_dev path from setting the 'tty_closing' local variable to the 
setting of the TTY_CLOSING flag. Thus, i believe the dropping of the 
down() is correct. 
This was the previous locking model for open vs. close afaict, before the 
down() was introduced in the release_dev path that was supposed to be 
atomic with respect to init_dev().

Indeed, the situation would be improved if it was held around the 
driver->close() routine. This routine does sometimes look at tty->count 
value, see con_close(), where in fact the tty_sem is added to avoid just 
this problem. However, it is incorrect as one can see in release_dev() the 
schedule(), can cause the tty->count to change via tty_open(). However, i 
think this is an extremely rare corner case, b/c con_close() keys off 
tty->count of 1, which implies that this is the last close() and thus the 
schedule for 'write_wait' would seem impossible, although AL Viro has 
said that it is possible in this case. Thus, dropping the tty_sem and 
reacquiring it, probably isn't good, b/c the driver->close() routines can 
free resources based upon tty->count==1. 
The patch was written as the least invasive and low risk way to fix a 
nasty race condition, which has the potential to corrupt data. The oops in 
vt_ioctl has also been seen on system boots with some frequency. The patch 
imo, returns the the tty_open vs. tty_close paths to their original 
locking assumptions which have been well tested.
