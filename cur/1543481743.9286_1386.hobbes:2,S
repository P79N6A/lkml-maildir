The original poster said "generalized message passing" and you
responded with something that can pass 4 or 8 bytes between
processes with the same UID. That isn't very general.
I'd be happy to see the doors patch in Linux 2.3, but perhaps
the original poster wanted the same kind of messages as Mach has.

True capability systems are token-based. They work very much like
file descriptor security. Access can be passed from process to
process, but is not automatically shared by all processes with the
same UID. Capability fanatics don't care about filesystem security,
because they believe the filesystem namespace is one giant hole
that should be eliminated. Obviously this conflicts with POSIX,
but less extreme versions are commonly found in UNIX-like systems.
Data General's DG-UX supports true capabilities on files, and it
grants access only when all systems (DAC, MAC, CAC) allow it.
DG-UX is popular at hospitals and is rated B2 without the GUI.

Normal users can:
* Run a network server.
* Run a network client.
* Read files that are world-readable.
* Run setuid executables.
* Create files in directories they own.
* Create directories in directories they own.
* Make their own files world-readable.
* Create SysV shared memory
* Create SysV semaphores
We've often seen requests to deny users the ability to run a network
server, and sometimes seen requests to deny users the ability to run a
network client. I know I'd want to block SysV shared memory use if I
were running a server with crummy users.

Excellent - but only for network IO?

For 28456 calls, your apps had to test for a condition that
did not happen.

It was handled in libc 5, but that was not standards compliant.
Some apps need the system calls to be interrupted. The addition
of an alternate API could reduce that need. Standards compliant
apps could have the behavior they expect, while Linux-specific
apps could have more logical behavior.
