"vmalloc reserve first; allocate pages later" would be a really nice
feature. We could use this on s390 to implement the virtual mem_map
array spanning the whole 64 bit address range (with holes in it). To
make it perfect a "deallocate pages; keep vmalloc reserve" should be
added, then we could free parts of the mem_map array again on hot memory
remove. 
I don't see a problem for s390.
