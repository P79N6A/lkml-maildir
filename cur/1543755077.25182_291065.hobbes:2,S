well not totally true, X on radeon/r200/r300 cards needs the DRM to
load the microcode for the command processor, this enables some major
speedups in the 2D code (it still talk direct to the card, but needs
the CP loading...) but X runs as root so it has no worries opening the
device...
the issue is with using having the perms set to 0660 since the drm
started supporting sysfs and udev... normally X created the dri
devices and set the permissions to what was in the X config, normally
666.... or 660 with a dri group...
