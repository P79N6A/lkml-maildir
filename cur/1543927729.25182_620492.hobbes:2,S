Hi Pierre,
Thanks for information.
My card does support 256 byte transfers in byte mode but I was expecting
block mode to be used as block mode is supported by the card. Indeed,
sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() checks for support of block mode before using
byte mode. eg. block mode is preferred over byte mode in the design of
sdio_io_rw_ext_helper().
Yes, I do think single block transfers is broken :(
Both sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() and mmc_io_rw_extended() are broken for
single block transfers.
Will you be doing a fix or how does a fix get proposed ?
Thanks,
Regards,
Dean.

The API was designed under the assumption that hardware actually followed the register interface and didn't distinguish between byte and block transfers. Unfortunately, it seems to be quite common that they do. Your situation is a problematic corner case.

So a function driver using such an API would have to use a much more defensive programming (which can incur a performance hit).
