More easy though (for cases of listening mp3's and backups): cache pages
that were accesed only "once"(*) several seconds ago must be discarded
first. It only implies a check against an access counter and a "last
accesed"  epoch fields of the page.
(*) Or by the same process/process group in a very short period, i.e. the
last-access timestamp should be updated only if the previous access was
few seconds ago.
