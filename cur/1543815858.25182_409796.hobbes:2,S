	Is the converity checker merly looking at in-function patterns?
Where can I access the bug report (sorry for the question).
	group cannot be null here, we aren't called any other way.  So
while you are correct that the code below is needed in the presence of a
NULL group, really the "if (group" isn't necessary, just the "if
(group->default_groups)".  I could even BUG_ON() if you'd like.
