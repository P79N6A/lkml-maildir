Yes. However, the consistent designation ...fast... does alleviate that 
somewhat. It
suffices to remember that in case of 'fast', the width mentioned is a 
minimum value.

I'm not so sure. Again, these types are quite clearly designated, 
something the #define
in question lacks. The other types in stdint.h, however, come in quite 
handy. Specifically
since they are guaranteed to represent correct widths by the 
compiler-guys.
Something to take up with the guys at 'comp.lang.c', i'd say.
