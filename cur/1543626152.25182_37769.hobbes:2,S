Linus changed the VM and chunks of the block layer in 2.4.10, that set back
stability work very seriously. It was a mistake but it happened, and most
of the repair work is done now. Not all of it. We've also gained things like
file system direct I/O as a result, so long term it may pay off, even
though it should have gone into 2.5 for stabilizing first
