Yes.  The execve-with-multiple-threads/posix-locks interaction is not
documented for LinuxThreads but removing steal_locks() makes that
implementation slighly differently incompatible to POSIX.  Some
application _might_ be relying on the current behavior.
It's just a question of how much confidence do we have, that no app
will break if steal_locks() is removed.  This function was added by
Chris Wright on 2003-12-29 (Cset 1.1371.111.3):
  Add steal_locks helper for use in conjunction with unshare_files to
  make sure POSIX file lock semantics aren't broken due to
  unshare_files.
Chris, do you remember if this was due to some concrete breakage or
just a preemtive measure?
