Hi,
the new longhaul driver of 2.6.21 is broken on my Via Eden board.
Frequencies can no longer be switched by whatever governor.

I ported the longhaul driver from 2.6.20.7 to 2.6.21, it works fine.
Yeah, I know there are only a few patches between both, but I would like
to reduce the test cycles to a minimum. Any suggestion where to look
first is welcome therefore, ready-to-apply patches even more...
Thanks,
Jan
