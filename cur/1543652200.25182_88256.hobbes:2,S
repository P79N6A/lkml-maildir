Great job! Many thanks! This reduces the bug a whole lot. I will think
on Monday what could be going wrong with that patch, in the meantime
just try to run (slower ;) with it backed out, to be sure it's really
such one (nevertheless if I had to guess right now I would say this most
certainly is triggering a bug somewhere else, unlikely that such patch
is really containing a bug, the patch is kind of obviously correct and
it is a so much stressed codepath that everybody would reproduce it if
that was the case, one of the reason I could never guess such patch
could be the interesting one for your case without your useful binary
search).
