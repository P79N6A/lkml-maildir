   Why is it sending a reset? Because the FIN was ACK'ed twice? Is
   this correct behavior? I've tried 2.2.14 and 2.2.17, with the same
   result.
Looks like the application on the Linux system is issuing a close() on
the socket before reading all of the available data.  That always
causes a RST to be sent.
