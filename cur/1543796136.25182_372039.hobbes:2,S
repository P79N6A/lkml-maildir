IOW a timeout uses a timer to implement an exceptional condition after a 
period of time expires.

The naming isn't actually my primary concern. I want a precise definition 
of the expected behaviour and usage of the old and new timer system. If I 
had this, it would be far easier to choose a proper name.
E.g. I still don't know why ktimeout should be restricted to raise just 
"error conditions", as the name implies.
