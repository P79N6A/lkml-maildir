It also seems a bit early to me, but it may work. I'll try to schedule some
time this week for a deep review.

IMO, this is one of the top priorities: the old-style i2c used on some bridge
drivers like saa7134 and cx88 are causing malfunctions that can't be easily
solved. I would like to see a fix for this for 2.6.29.

I only send Linus the patches that are already ok, but I generally prefer to
postpone a merge for the end of a merge window, when the patch is not meant to
be at the next version.

Hmm... why? it would be better to try to have the KABI changes for it at the
same kernel release if possible.

This makes sense to me.

Are you meaning marking this as experimental at Kconfig? This seems too
complex, since we'll need to test for some var on every driver that were
converted, providing two KABI options for each converted driver (the legacy and
the v4l2_device way). This doesn't seem to be a good idea, since will add a lot
of extra complexity to debug bugs.
