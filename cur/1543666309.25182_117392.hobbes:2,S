I'm interested in this patch in your tree.  (Just to warn you of my 
biases, I'm currently working with the XScale/ARM arch.)  I've noticed 
some things about it in an initial look, namely:
There appears to be some code duplication between hex() and stubhex() in 
arch/i386/kernel/gdbstub.c.
Also, the bulk of gdbstub.c appears to be generic code.  There are a 
number of functions that have x86 asm in them, but it looks to me on 
initial viewing, that most of the logic is applicable to other arches. 
Am I understanding that correctly?
Right now it looks like an arch would need to provide a way to:
- reboot the processor
- implement 'continue at address' and 'step one instruction from address'
- handle_exeption()
- printexception()
- correct_hw_break()
- regs_to_gdb_regs() and gdb_regs_to_regs()
     Hmm, there's probably some more to that part...
The above is just for the gdbstub.c.  I'm still reading the patch. :)
Would breaking the arch-independent parts out to linux/kernel/gdbstub.c 
be a reasonable change or is that a dumb question? ;)
Thanks,
Eli
