Everything is OK. Your BIOS probably sets up write-back for your main memory
and write-combining for your framebuffer (VGA) onyl on hte first (boot) CPU.
Linux detects it and sets the second CPU the same way and tells you about it.
Everything fine with Linux.
I don't know what NT or Solaris do, but they don't tell you ...
Note that inconsistent settings in this case don't affect system stability,
only performance ...
BTW: A lot of BIOSes only set the framebuffer wrt-comb. on the first CPU,
AFAIK.
