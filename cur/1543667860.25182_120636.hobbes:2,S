Btw, one feature I'd like to see in shortlog is the ability to use 
regexps for email address matching, ie something like
	'torvalds@.*transmeta.com' => 'Linus Torvalds'
	... 
	'alan@.*swansea.linux.org.uk' => 'Alan Cox'
	...
	'bcrl@redhat.com' => 'Benjamin LaHaise',
	'bcrl@.*' => '?? Benjamin LaHaise',
	..
I don't know whether you can force perl to do something like this, but if 
somebody were to try...
