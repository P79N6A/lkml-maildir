*raises hand*
I'm working on event handling code for multiple projects right now, and my 
method of calling epoll_wait() is to do so from several threads. I've 
glanced at the epoll code but obviously haven't noticed the wake-all 
behavior... good to know. I suppose I'm going to have to hack around this 
problem by wrapping epoll_wait() calls in a mutex. That sucks - it means 
other threads won't be able to 'get ahead' by preparing their wait before 
it is their turn to dequeue events.
In any case, I think having multiple threads blocking on epoll_wait() is a 
much saner idea than one thread which then passes out events, so I must 
voice my support for fixing this case. Why this is the exception instead 
of the norm is a little baffling, but I've seen so many perverse things in 
multi-threaded code...
