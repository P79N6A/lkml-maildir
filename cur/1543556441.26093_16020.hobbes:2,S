Those applications already have to deal with the fact some devices only
support 48KHz 16bit stereo audio. I run a full desktop environment on such
hardware without problems.
What format is it that causes the problems, the only badly supported key format
right know I know of is 16bit bigendian. That needs some small esd patches.
