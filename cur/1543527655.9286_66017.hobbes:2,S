Another reason I've met for mingetty respawning too fast is where
one is using both X and consoles on a box with an EGA card in it
(which I had to do not that long ago). If one closes the console
whilst X is still running, mingetty will generate this problem.
Since mgetty in the same situation does NOT generate the problem,
I have to assume that such is a bug in mingetty rather than any
kernel or X problem. Certainly, I solved it for that box by just
changing mingetty for mgetty.
Best wishes from Riley.
