The removal timers need to be taken out from most *_cs drivers; they
are a holdover from when card removal events were delivered in
interrupt context, and when that was changed to an event handler
thread, drivers were not changed accordingly.  The removal routine
should now just be called in-line instead of firing up a timer.

On most but not all x86 systems floating ports return 0xff.  Checking
for that or other "impossible" register values should be at least
harmless on other architectures.
