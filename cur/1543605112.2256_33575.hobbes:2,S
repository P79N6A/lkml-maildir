  Subject: We Will Send Your E Mail For You
  If you wish to send a message using an E Mail list of almost any size, 
  either on a one time or repetitive basis, we can send your E Mail for 
  you. 
  We have high speed bandwidth, and are our own ISP.  We do not have any 
  restrictions on the size of the E Mail list you can use, nor do we 
  concern ourselves over whether the lists we send for our customers are 
  "opt in" or not; we rely on our customer's discretion.  We can also 
  develop custom E Mail lists for you, should you need them.
