Yes, on the other hand we may try to do real refcounting.
Actually I think there are holes in the above locking scheme but need to think 
more about it - i.e. what protects us from removing hwif while it is being 
configured by host driver?

sysfs doesn't help at all as IDE is not ready for full sysfs support
(missed locking, no refcounting and no dynamic objects)
I also can't see how sysfs can help with synchronizing writes to ISA/PCI 
config space with ongoing I/O?
Please also note that PCI writes currently doesn't work because of "... || 
hwif->pci_dev->vendor" instead of "... || !hwif->pci_dev->vendor" - somebody 
(I think you :) broke this back in 2.4.21 kernel.

I'm not aware of any users and I have patch ready to deprecate it.

Yes, but reporting PCI ones in detail will brake any users of this /proc entry 
(if there are any of course).
Thanks.
