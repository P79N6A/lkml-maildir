The behaviour it provides is correct and intentional. The documentation
is also quite plain on the fact you need swap for mode 3.
Since the kernel needs memory for its own purposes you cannot run
swapless with no overcommit and allow user space all of memory.
2.5 propses including the ability to set the %age between the 0% of mode
3, the 50 of mode 2 and upwards to things relevant in some embedded
system cases. So for 2.6 you will be able to tune it in different ways
according to precise understanding of workload.
As far as your hang goes I'd grab a standard 2.4.19 or 2.4.19-ac4 kernel
and try that.
